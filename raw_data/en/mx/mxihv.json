Dianne J Crellin ORCID: 0000 -0003 -2629 -0483 Submitted in total fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philos ophy August 2018 The Department of Nursing, Melbourne School of Health Sciences The University of Melbourne i Abstract Infants and young children frequently experience pain as a consequence of medical proced ures associated with their healthcare. Pain ma nagement is often suboptimal, and this is in part due to the difficulties associated with assessment of pain of infants and children too young to self -report pain intensity. Observable behaviours indicative of pain have long been considered a viable altern ative and scales comprised of these behaviours have prolif erated in the literature. However, it remains unclear which scales are best suited for procedural pain assessment and whether they are well supported by psychometric data. The aim s of this project were to: identify behavioural observation scale s potential ly suitable for procedural pain assessment, summarise a vailable psychometric data and prospectively test the psychometric properties of potentially suitable scales when used to assess procedural pai n in infants and young children. These aims were addressed in three phases of work : i) a thorough interrogation of the literature to identify scales considered potentially suitable for assessing procedur al pain in infants and children, ii) a series of syst ematic reviews to summarise the evidence supporting the ps ychometric properties of the identified scales and iii) a prospective observational study to test the psychometric properties of these scales used to assess procedural pain in infants and young chil dren. Three scales, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Co nsolability Scal e (FLACC), the Modified Behavio ral Pain Scale (MBPS) and the Visual Analogue Scale for observers (VASobs), met predefined criteria and were considered potentially suitable for inclus ion in this project. The systematic reviews showed that av ailable psychometric data was insufficient to recommend these scales for procedural pain assessment of infants and children. There was data to tentatively support the MBPS and to a lesser extent the VASobs for assessing immunisation related pain . The data regarding the FLACC scale was inconclusive . The results of the prospective study confirmed that all scales were sensitive to pain. The FLACC scale and MBPS scores were reliable ( intraclass (I CC) 0.92 and 0.87, respectively) but VASobs scores w ere less reliable (ICC 0.55). The FLACC scores showed the highest sensitivity (94.9%) and specific ity (72.5%) for procedure type (painful vs non -painful) at the lowest cut -off score (pain score 2, area under the curve ( AUC 0.83 )). Similar results were achieved at a MBPS cut -off score of 4 (sensitivity 91.5%, specificity 77.5%, AUC 0.8 5). The FLACC scale resulted in more incomplete scores (p < 0.000) and was changed more often than ii other scale scores. Reviewers liked the VASobs most, considered it the quicke st and easiest to apply, but judged the FLACC scale and MBPS to be more likely to be useful. In conclusion, three behavioural observational pain scales to assess procedural pain in infants and young children were identified and included in systematic rev iews. This work culminated in a prospective study, the results of which support use of the FLACC scale, but not without reservation as there are practical limitations when used to assess procedural pain. These results build on promising existing evidence t hat suggests that the FLACC scale may currently be a suitable scale for procedural pain assessment in infants and young children. iii Declaration This is to certify that: 1.

The second chapter in this section provides a summary of the concepts that underpin this project : pain, the assessment of pain and the methods used to test the performance of (pain) assessment tools. SECTION 1 2 1 CHAPTER 1 The assessment and management of the pain experienced by infants and children during painful procedures has gained increasing attention from clinicians and researchers over the last 20 years and y et there are still major deficits in our understanding and o ur practice. The focus of this research is procedural pain assessment in infants and young children. This chapter outlines the rationale for this and articulates the specific research questions. T he phases of the research undertaken to answer these questio ns and the layout o f this thesis are also outlined in this chapter. Rationale Infants and young children frequently experience pain as a consequence of medical procedures associated with their he althcare. Current immunisation schedules include multiple injections at regular intervals throughout infancy and early childhood (1). Hospitalisation also results in frequent exposure to painful diagnostic and ther apeutic procedures. Prevalence of pain is high in neonates, infants and young children who make up the bulk of paediatric hospital admissions. (2- 8). Prevalence studies focusing on neonates have reported that the a verage neonate in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) experience s an average of 5.6 painful procedures per week (2) but up to as many as 16 per day (3, 7, 9) . Infa nts and children in other parts of the hospi tal fare better but nonetheless still experience a substantial number of painful procedures during their admission. In a Canadian study of children admitted to one of 32 inpatient units across 8 paediatric hospit als, 78% of children had at least one painfu l procedure in the 24 hours prior to data collection and the average number of procedures for those children who had a least one procedure was 6.3 (8). In a cohort of 252 children presenting to a Mexican emergency department, 369 painful procedures were performed (5). There is strong evidence illustrating the negative consequences of exposure to pain during infancy. Over 20 years ago, Taddio and colleagues reported the impact that neonatal circumcision had on immunisation related pain in infanc y (10, 11) . Based on post -hoc analysis of data derived from a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ), they reported higher pain intensity scores during 4 - 6 month immunisation in male infants who were circumcised in th e newborn period than male infants who had not been circumcised (11). In their second study de signed specifically to test this association between circumcision and immunisation, scores were again higher in infants who had been circumcised as a neonate (10). In addition, r epeated heel lances in the first 24 to 36 hours of SECTION 1 3 life resulted in more intense pain responses to venepuncture than was recorded in newborns who did not r eceive repeated heel lances (12). Several research groups have concentrated their research efforts on developing an understanding of the impact of early exposure to pain on neurocog nitive development. Valeri and colleagues, in a systematic review of 13 studies addressing the impact of neonatal pain exposure on developmental outcomes, found strong associations between the number of painful procedures and delayed post -natal growth, poo rer early neurodevelopment and poorer cognitive and motor function at one year of age, and higher levels of cortical activation and changes in cortical rhythmicity and cortical thickness in 7 year old children (13). Animal models and the advent of newer imaging modalities have provided a mechanism for exploring the impact of pa inful procedures on neurodevelopmental physiology that may be responsible for the adverse outcomes. The premature neonate's brain continues to undergo significant maturation which involves; the programming of the hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal axis, the fo rmation of new synaptic connections, activity related selective apoptosis to shape the brain, proliferation and differentiation of glial cells, sub -plate neurons, elaboration of dendrites and axons and alignment, orientation and layering of cortical neuron s (14). It seems likely that stress a nd inflammation associated with injury and pain play a key role in interrupting these activities of development. White and grey brain matter changes are seen on MRI studies of premature neonates and these changes persist into adulthood (14). There is also a body of evide nce illustrating the effects of unrelieved pain in adults, much of which concentrates on the impact of postoperative pain (15). Acute ph ysiological effects include hyperalgesia, hyperglycaemia, protein catabolism, changes in water and electrolyte flux and increased sympathetic activity (16-20). Postoperative cognitive dysfunction has been linked to postoperative pain ; the aetiology of which is not well understood but is likely the result of dysregulation o f cognitive neurotransmitters (21, 22) . The psychological effects of unrelieved pain include alterations to sleep patterns (23), increased anxiety (24) and, importantly, an increased ris k of the development of persistent pain (25, 26) . Much of the work exploring the negative effects of procedural pain has concentrated on the short and long -term effects of unrelieved procedural pain experienced by preterm and term neon ates or unrelieved postoperative pain on adults (15). However, a study of the psychological effect of serious illn ess on older children confirms the deleterious effects of pain on older age groups of children (27). The number of invas ive painful procedures was shown to be the strongest predictor of significant psychological se quelae at 6 weeks and 6 months following children's discharge from paediatric critical care units (27). SECTION 1 4 Despite the frequency with which infants and children are exposed to painful procedures, the implications of unrelieved pain and the proliferation of evidence supporting strategies to minimise procedural pain, there is still considerable concern about procedural pain management. In Johnston and colleagues' neonatal pain prevalence study, half of the procedures we re performed without analgesic interventions (2) and a quarter of the children in the Canadian survey of hospitalised children reported having received no analgesic or local anaesthetics prior to their last needle -stick procedure (4). One of the potential barriers to providing effective pain management is the capacity to accurately recognise pain and measure its in tensity to determine the need for, and the effectivene ss of, pain relief. Procedural pain assessment Self-report of pain is considered ideal but is not an option in patients either too unwell or cognitively or developmentally unable to self -report. In th ese circumstances clinicians and researchers are relia nt on proxy measures as a n indirect surrogate for estimating the patient's pain experience. A range of methods have been proposed, developed and/or tested to quantify pain intensity; the most commonly used and recommended of which are observationa l behavioural scales. Large numbers of these scales have b een developed to assess pain in infants and children and many of these scales have been tested and/or are used in a range of circumstances to assess pain. However, there is no consensus as to the sc ale best suited to procedural pain assessment. Two system atic reviews published in 2007 synthesised the evidence regarding the psychometric properties of available observational scales to generate recommendat ions for use. Von Baeyer and Spagrud recommende d the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) sca le (28) and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) (29) for assessment of procedural pain in children aged three to 18 years (30). They claim ed excellent reliability, validity and responsiveness for these two pain assessment tools . The FLACC scale is acknowledged as less burdensome as it is ba sed on five easily recalled items all scored on a scale of 0 to 2 (30). In contrast, the strength of t he CHEOPS is the reliance on easily observed behaviours that do not rely on a judgement in the same way that the consolability item of the FLACC scale does (30). Crellin and colleagues were more cautious and claim ed that these scales while showing promise were not supported by sufficient evidence to claim them as appropriate for procedural pain assessment use in infants and young children (31). Despite this, in the absence of an appropriate alternative they recomm ended these scales for clinical purposes. SECTION 1 5 Although these reviews were conducted approximately 10 years ago and these scales are likely to have undergone further testing, more recent reviews to re -evaluate our understanding of the performance of these sca les to assess procedural pain do not appear to be availabl e. Professional organisations responsible for recommendations regarding pain assessment and management do not make consistent recommendations without reservations for a specific scale for procedural pain assessment. The Royal Colle ge of Nursing in their clinical practice guideline aimed at advising clinicians regarding the assessment and management of pain in infants and children recommended the FLACC scale, CHEOPS and the University of Wisconsin Pai n Scale (32). However, significant limitations to the studies on which re commendations were based were noted. More recently, the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists and Faculty of Pain Medicine published the 4th edition of their synthesis of the evidence for acute pain management and in this document, they ackno wledged that 'there is no gol d standard' available for procedural pain assessment in infants and children but that based on current data the FLACC scale and the CHEOPS are most suitable (15). Study aims/questions The aim of this project was to identify observational assessment scales with adequate psychometric properties to recommend the scale for assessing procedural pain in infants and young children who are unable to self -report pain. This aim generated three research questions which are as follows: 1. Is there an observational pain assessment scale considered suitable for assessing the procedural pain experienced by infants and young chi ldren? 2. Is this scale/Are thes e scales supported by sufficient psychometric data to recommend the scale for use? 3. Can the selected observation scales be recommended for procedural use following psychometric testing? Overview of study/methods This project w as conducted in a series of sequential steps aimed at answering the research questions. SECTION 1 6 The first of these steps was to systematically search the literature to identify scales that were considered potentially suitable for procedural pain assessment in inf ants and young chi ldren. Crite ria were established to define considered 'suitable' and they included scale design characteristics, evidence of psychometric testing for procedural use and recommendations supporting the scales use. The second of these steps was to establish the strength of evidence supporting the psychometric properties of the identified scales. This was achieved by systematic review s. A robust search strategy was developed to identify relevant literature and study quality was reviewed using appropriate quali ty assessment tools. Studies that aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the scale were included in these reviews. In addition, high quality randomised controlled trials (RCT) that used the scale to measure a study outcome were al so included as the y potentially contribute validation data. Data was extracted from the studies, reviewed and a narrative synthesis completed the analysis of the psychometric properties of each scale. The third and final stage of this research was a stud y designed to test the psychometric properties of the chosen scales (identified in phase 1 and systematically reviewed in phase 2 ) applied to infants aged 6 to 42 months who underwent a painful procedure. It was intended that the results of this phase woul d answer the third research question. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of application and clinical utility of the se scale s and the reliability, responsiveness, discrimination and convergence of scores. A convenience sample of twenty -six cl inicians viewed segments of video depicting 100 children aged six to 42 months undergoing a procedure and applied the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs to score the infant or child's pain intensity . Procedures considered painful and non -painful were pur posefully include in this study to determine whether the scales could discriminate between pain and non -pain related distress. Thesis outline This thesis is comprised of 13 chapters, organised into five sections which include a literature review, sections addressing each r esearch question and a final discussion. Section 1 includes 2 chapters , the first of which addresses the rationale for this work and the research questions that the project is intended to answer (Chapter 1). An overview of the phases of this project and the methods used to address each question is also provided in this chapte r. The second chapter of section 1 briefly explains our current understanding of pain and the methods SECTION 1 7 used to assess pain intensity (Chapter 2). A summary of the prin ciples of and the methods used to assess the psychometric properties of assessment tools a re also provided in this chapter. Section 2 of this thesis details the first stage of this work in a single chapter (Chapter 3). This documents the systematic search for a scale considered potentially suitable for assessing procedural pain in infants and young children unable to self -report pain. From this work three scales were identified as potentially suitable for this purpose; the FLACC Scale, the MBPS and the VAS obs. Section 3 of this thesis addresses the second research question of this thesis. Chap ter 4 reports the methods used to conduct a series of systematic reviews to summarise the psychometric properties of the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs. Chapter s 5 to 7 report the results of the systematic reviews for each scale. Chapter 6 is a Porta ble Document Format (PDF) version of the FLACC scale review published in Pain and Chapter 7 is a PDF version of the MBPS review published in Journal of Pediatric Nurs ing. Section 4 of this thesis details the psychometric testing of the FLACC scale, the M BPS and the VASobs in response to the third research question . Chapter 8 is a PDF of the protocol used for the observational study , which was published in BMJ Open . Chapters 9 to 11 report the results of the psychometric testing of the FLACC scale , MBPS and the VASobs . The FLACC scale and the MBPS results were published in the Journal of Pain and are presented as PDF versions of these papers. In Chapter 12 the results of a comparison of the psychometrics of these scales are reported. This thesis concludes with Section 5 which is presented in a single chapter (Chapter 13 ). This chapter summarises the key findings of this research and discusses the implications of these findings. Recommendations for clinical practice and fu ture research are also reported. Ancillary documents and supplementary figures and tables of data which are not key to the thesis but are referred to are included in a series of Appendices. SECTION 1 8 2 CHAPTER 2 This chapter provides an overview of pain, briefly describe s the neurophysiology and the pain experience, summarises methods of pain intensity assessment and finally identifies the approach to developing and testing the psychometric performance of obse rvational (pain) scales. It is intended to serve as general background to the thesis and not as a detailed appraisal of the literature regarding these topics or as they relate specifically to paediatric pain . More detailed reviews of relevant literature ar e presented prior to each phase of this research. Pain The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) prov ides the most widely accepted definition of pain: ' an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with potential and actual t issue damage or described in terms of such damage ' (33). Traditionally, pain was thought to be experienced only in the setting of potential or actual tissue dam age and to reflect the extent of the damage, i.e. the more damage to the tissue the more severe the pain and vice versa (34). Advan ces in our understanding of pain have resulted in acceptance that pain is a much more complex experience potentially inf luenced by factors not directly related to tissue damage, that this description better explains nociception and that these terms (pain a nd nociception) are not synonymous (35). In the following sections pain and nociception are explored more fully to better underst and the IASP definition of pain which takes us beyond the traditional nociceptive definition of pain. Nocicepti on Pain is an integral part of the body's defence mechanisms and demonstrates a stimulus -response relationship where noxious stimuli trigger a cascade of neuro -physiological actions to prevent or limit tissue damage. Nociception describes the proc ess behind physiological pain and is defined as the 'neural encoding of noxious stimuli', where noxious stimuli are defined as an 'actual or potentially tissue damaging event' (33). Transduction, transmission, modulation and perception describe the neurophysiological sequence that characterise nociception (36). SECTION 1 9 Transduction and transmission Nociceptors a re specialised high -threshold sensory receptors of primary somatosensory neurons located as free nerve e ndings in the tissues (cutaneous and visceral) (37). Nociceptive processing begins with activation of the nociceptor by the noxious stimuli and transduction , which is encoding of the noxious stimuli as a receptor potential (38). Nociceptors are variably responsive to specific stimuli such as mechanical (stretching, cutting or pinching), thermal (extremes of temperature) and/or chemical (exogenous and endogenous chemicals) stimul i (38). It was traditionally thought that receptors respond ed to only one type of stimulus. However, it is increasingly recognised that most receptors are polymodal and will respond to all types of stimuli given the right circumstances, e.g. intensity of stimulus (39). A subset of receptors found in joints and viscera are considered 'silent' and only respond and transduce stimuli once they have been sensitised to inflammatory mediators (37-39). The receptor potential is then conveyed as an action potential via the peripheral ne rvous system to the spinal cord; transmission (38). The cell bodies of the primary somatosensory neurons, which are located within the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, give rise to axons myelinated A -fibres or unmyelinated polymodal C -fibres (37). These two classes of fibres respond differently to noxious stimuli. The nociceptors of the A -fibre are triggered by noxious stimuli, have a narrow receptive field, rapidly transmit the signal and only continue to signal in the prese nce of t he noxious stimulus. These fibres are responsible for initial sharp well localised pain that occurs immediately after the stimulus (39). The receptors associated with these fibres are largely located in the skin. In contrast, nociceptors of C -fibres are recruited more slowly, continue to send electrical signals beyond the termination of the noxious stimulus and have a larger receptive field. These fibres are responsible for the dull ache that develops more slowly and is also slower to resolve (39). Activation of the nociceptor also provokes release of neuropeptides substance P calcitonin gene - related peptide (CGRP ) at the peripheral termina l, which triggers neurogenic inflammation (39). Release of s ubstance s from injured and inflamed tissue s such cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), prostaglandins and histamine act to either lower the activation threshold of these receptors or increase excitability, which in both cases amplifies n ocicepti ve signalling (40). The axons of these fibres transmit the ele ctrical signal to second order neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord predominantly in laminae I and II (40, 41) . Synaptic transmission of the sensory signal across the synaptic junction is triggered by release of the nociceptors ' primary neurotransmitter, glutamate (37, 41) . The post -synaptic terminals are found in different types of dorsal horn neurons : interneurons, propriospinal neurons and projection neur ons. I ntern eurons SECTION 1 10 may be either excitatory or inhibitory and participate in local processing , e.g. transmission of nociceptive signals received in laminae I and II to second -order neurons in laminae IV, V and VI (42). Propriosp inal neuron s extend over spinal segments and are involved in segmental reflex activity . Finally, projection neurons are responsible for transmission of signals beyond the spinal cord to the brain via the spinothalamic tract and several associated tracts which include s the spinobulbar tract (43, 44) . The second order projection neurons of the s pinothalamic tract decussate in the anterior white commissure at about the level that they enter the spinal cord and ascend in the anterolateral quadrant of the cord (43). They pass through the brainstem, including the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain, and terminate in the ventral caudal nucleus of the thalamus where they synapse with third order neurons which project to the primary somatosensory cortex . The exact site in the thalamus depends on the location of the original stimulus (e.g. cutaneous versus visceral and body versus face and head) (43). The somatosensory cortex, specifically somatosensory areas I and II in the post central gyrus and superior wall of sylvian fis sure are the main sensory receptive regions of the brain responsible for the sense of touch and along with the spinothalamic tract, i s somatotopically organised to make localisation of sensation, in this case pain, possible (45). Fibres of the spinobulbar tract that project to the pons and mesencephalon enter the posterior horn and decussate at the level of en try and synapse with neurons in the anterior horn in a similar pattern to the spinothalamic tract fibres (43). In contrast, t he fibres of this pathway that terminate in the medulla ascend via an ipsilateral tract. The fibres of th e spin obulbar tract terminate in four regions of the brainstem: the catecholamine cell groups, the parabrachial nucleus (PB) , the periaqueductal gr ay (PAG) and the reticular format ion (43). These region s of the brain act to integrate sensory data with homeostatic functions and trigger autonomic cardiorespiratory responses. Collatera l projections f rom the PB link the hypothalamus, amygdala and regions of the thalamus that relay signals to the anterior cin gulate cortex, the insular cortex and the forebrain (43). These terminations help explain the autonomic and emotional responses associated with pain.

Figure 1. The major ascending (a) and descending (b) pain modulatory systems are illustrated in this schematic representation. p.6 (40) Pain perception Pain can be categorised as either somatic or visceral and this effects pain perception (46). Somatic pain defines pain that originates from the skin, muscles or peripheral nerves (cutaneous, superficial pain) or deeper structures such as tendons and fascia (deep pain) . Visceral pain defines pain that originates from the visceral organs . Somatic pain is characterised by perception of an initial sharp pain that is well locali sed followed by a more defuse burning or aching sensation. Figure 2-1 A diagram showing the major ascending and descending pain pathways SECTION 1 12 The first pain reflects stimulation of A -fibres and transmission of these signals via the spinothalamic trac t to the sensory cortex (37, 43) . Stimulation of C -fibres results in slower transmission of signals to the cortex and in a delayed perception of a burning pain. Signals from the tendons, fascia and joint receptors are also perceived as dull aching or burning pain. In addition to pain, signals from dee per tissues may also trigger autonomic responses such as sweating and changes in heart rate and blood pressure . Visceral pain arises from mechanical and chemical stimulation of nociceptors in visceral organs (37, 43 ). These signals are poorly localised and are usually accompanied by autonomic responses (47). In some circumstances visceral pain is referred to sites other than the original site of injury or inflammation. Predictable patterns for referred pain are rec ognised e.g. angina perceived as pain in t he chest wall and down the left arm (42). One explanation postulated for this is that this may be the result of convergence in the spinal cord of the pathways carrying noxious stimuli f or the viscera and the sites where viscera l pain is referred (47). It would be sho rt-sighted not to recognise the affective impact of pain signalling and how this impacts on pain perception. Several regions of the brain have been shown to participate and observations made in animal and human stu dies have elucidated the role that they pl ay in the pain experience , which will be addressed in more detail in section 2.1.2 (48). Almost two decades ago , Ploner and colleagues described the case of an adult, with injury to regions of the somatosensory cortex as a resu lt of stroke, experiencing 'unpleasantness' and a desire to avoid a thermo - nociceptive stimulus, despite not recognising this stimulus as 'painful' (49). Conversely, over 50 years ago Foltz and colleagues described that ablation of the anterior cingulate cortex in patien ts with intractable pain resulted in immediate relief (50). These patients described a sensation of pain but without the associated unpleasantness. Pain is in most circumstances perceived as both noxious (sensory component) and unpleasant (affective component) and both contribute to the more complex constellation of sensations, emotions and responses that defines the pain experience (section 2.1.2 ). Pain modulation As has already been alluded to pain is not exclusively the product of a stimulus -response relationsh ip. Complex mechanisms suppress and potentiate the passage of pain signals to the brain , the process referred to as modulation . This may in part explain the wide variation in the pain experienced by individuals in response to the same stimulus. Delineation of the neuronal pathways, the neurotransmitters and chemical mediators involved in modulation are some of the most significant advances to our understandin g of the science of pain made by researches in the last few decades. Modulation involves a complex a rray of interconnected regions of the brain and SECTION 1 13 chemical mediators directly and indirectly involved in nociceptive neurotransmission which include; us opioids, noradrenaline, adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and inflammatory mediators (36). The higher centres implicated in descending modulatio n of pain are the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the midbrain, (51). The PAG is located in the midbrain and is key to central modulation of p ain. The PAG is rich in opioid receptors and highly responsive to exogenous and endogenous opioids. Release of opioids in the PAG provokes powerful anti -nociception (40, 51) . The PAG receives ascending signals and signals from the hypothalamus, thalamus, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula and collaterals of the spinothalamic tract. of these signals provokes opioid -mediated inhibition of nociceptive signalling vi a enkephalanergic projections to syn aptic junctions in the NRM and the locus coeruleus (51). Serotoninergic projections from the post-synaptic neurons of the NRM coupled with noradrenergic projections from the post -synaptic neurons of the locus coeruleus transmit inhibitory signals to block the dorsal horn nociceptive neurons from transmitting ascending nociceptive signals (40, 51). In addition, stimulation of the PAG and the NRM triggers central and spinal cord release of endogenous opioids (44). At least 10 endogenous opioids (e.g. -endorphins, and dynorphins) and their preferred re ceptors (e.g. \u00b5, and ) have been identified by researchers. Opioid receptor activation results in inhibition of the presynaptic calcium and potassium channels preventing the release of pain -related neurotransmitters into the synaptic junction, hence blo cking the passage of pain signals. This occurs in the central and peripheral nervous system (40). Immediately following tissue injury an area of inflammation develops. Algogenic s ubstances, such as: histamine and bradykinin which sensitise C -fibres and reduce their threshold, are released from damaged and inflamed ti ssues (52). Peripheral sensitisation of noc iceptors and thei r neurons caused by repeated stimulation results in : decreased threshold, increased signal frequency, decreased latency to response and spontaneous firing despite the cessation of the noxious stimuli (39, 53) . The results of changes in signalling in both circumstances results in increased painful sensation in response to additional noxious stimuli and this is known as hyperalgesia (39). This modulation of responses may well play a key role in the development of chronic pain (39). SECTION 1 14 Pain experience Historically, pain was considered to reflect an evolutionary mechanism to reduce tissue injury and this gave rise to the view that the experience of pain is a direct function of the extent of the tissue injury (54). Furthermore, it was considered that noxious stimuli triggered a predictable response that would result in a consistent sensation (severity and nature) entirely dependent on the st imulus (55). These early descriptions of pain have repeatedly been shown to represent an overly simplistic understanding of the experience of pain. Increasing understan ding of the neurophysiology o f pain, the extensive regions of the brain involved in pain processing and extensive and meticulous observations made of individuals experiencing pain have paved the way for recognition of influences well beyond direct stimulat ion of nociceptors to explain the pain experience. It is a complex interplay between sensory perception and cognitive and emotional processing and behavioural and physical reactions to pain and this section addresses some of the key elements that contribut e to the experience. Although these elements are inseparable as they each have a profound influence on the contribution that make to the pain experience, for the purposes of this discussion these elements will be grouped and discussed in the following sect ions. Cognitive processing Attention has long been considered a function of the resources allocated to processing of neural data, the intention of which is to achieve goal directed actions (behavioural and physiological) that are consistent with the stimuli (56, 57) . Pain by its aversive nature demands attention which is aimed at provoking an appropriate response to prevent additional harm. The corollary to this is that when attention is focused on pain it is experienced more intensively (56, 58) . Furthermore, paradoxically, attempting to suppress thoughts about pain may actually increase the pain experienced (59). Functional MRI results have shown that people d istracted from the noxious stimulus have less neural activit y in the regions of the brain involved in sensory and affective pain processing (somatosensory cortex, insula and anterior cingulate cortex, and the thalamus) and reported lower levels of pain tha n people whose attention was not refocused (60-62). Concurrently increased activation of the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and PAG is seen in the setting of distraction. Studies in children undergoin g painful procedures repeatedly report the positive effects of music, t elevision, video games and virtual reality on the pain experience associated with these procedures (63-67). There is strong evidence that suppo rts an interaction between attention and the descending facilitatory or inhibitory modulation of pain. However, there is a similar body of data that highlights that this interaction is not uniform and that there may be marked individual differences in the impact of attention and that this may also be situational (68). SECTION 1 15 Pain signals provoked by sensory data originating from the periphery are interpreted consciously and/or unconsciously and based on the likeli hood that they represent actual or potential tissue damage (59). Interpretation will be heavily influenced by past experience, memories of these experiences, expectations of the pain and personality factors such as the individual's perception of their ab ility to cope with the pain. This interpretation of the meaning of pain signals modulates the experience such that these signals may generate a more or less unpleasant and painful experience across a range of individ uals who perceive the meaning of the sen sory signals differently. Experience and the memory of previous events is an opportunity to learn and hence institute appropriate behaviours to manage potentially or actually harmful circumstances. There is evidence that pain memory activates unique centr es in the brain when compared with memories of a non -noxious nature or imagined pain (69). However, evidence published more than a decade ago showed that memory of previous painful experience and the efficacy of treatment is often exaggerated (59). Furthermore, experience also lays the foundation for anticipatory fear and anxiety which can have a significant effect on pain experience (1, 70) . How we interpret pain will also be influenced by our ex pectations for the pain, e.g. how long it might last or how intensely it might be felt. Studies have reported strong links between the level of pain expected, activation of regions of the br ain responsible for pain processing and the pain intensity reporte d (71-73). This may also underlie the mechanism for the effectiveness of placebo medications whereby the expectation of efficacy is sufficient to cause a reduction in the pain experienced (56). Expectations are influenced by previous experience, learning, culture and social setting (74) which contribute to our schematic model for pain that allows us to assess the salience of the pain and make predictions about painful exp eriences . For example, more severe pain may be co nsidered indicative of more severe illness or injury. Concerns such as this may also feed concern, fear and anxiety based on the perceived threat associated with the pain. This is particularly the case when sensory data conflicts with expectations. Two stu dies, both conducted more than 10 years ago, reported increased pain scores for the same intensity stimulus when participants were cued to expect a much lower intensity stimulus compared with more accurate cues regarding intensity (72, 75) . The degree of threat that pain poses is in part modified by the individual's perceived ability to control the pain (56). Perceived control over the painful s timuli can decrease the pain experience . Salomons reported reduced activity in the ACC, insula and som atosensory cortex (76) and in a second study the prefrontal cortex (77) in participants given perceived control over the stimulus. In contrast, a perceived lack of control may generate feelings of hopelessness which amplify the SECTION 1 16 perception of pain. Strongly linked to perceived control over the pain is perception of capacity to cope with pain a nd concern about inability to cope can give rise to negative emotions such as hopelessness, frustration and guilt all of which are potentially pain promot ing (78). There is a growing body of research that reports the deleterious effect of pain catastrophizing on pain experience and contrastingly the positive effec ts of reinterpreting pain as benign sensory data on pain intensity (56, 79 -84). Emotional processing Pain is an unpleasant and aversive experience linked to a range of negative emotions that have already been a lluded to a nd they include; fear, anxiety, guilt, anger, frustration and hopelessness. The amygdala plays a role in generating emotional understanding of the significance of sensory stimuli, including pain. As has been suggested in the previous section the re is signi ficant interaction between cognitive and emotional processing to inform the affective features of the pain experience (48). This interaction i s illustrat ed in a study examining the impact on anxiety and perceived control over the noxious stimuli (85). Controllable pain was associated with decreased anxiety and activation of the amygdala compared with uncontrollable pain. While, the emotional features of pain are what creates the unpleasantness of pain it is also clear that they play a modulator y role and facilitate or inhibit pain perception. There are clinical and experimental studies which demonstrate that emotions and mood impact both positively and negatively on the pain associated with chronic disease and that positive manipulati on of emoti on and mood decreases the perception of pain and that provoking negative emotions and/or mood has the opposite effect on pain perception (68). Furthermore, the centres responsible for processin g emotion a re also heavily involved in arousal and attention. This means that negative emotions increase arousal and serve to focus attention on pain and hence increase the unpleasantness of the sensation. Finally, these emotions blunt function of the pre -frontal cor tex which decreases higher cognitive control to institute measures to control and modify the situation. This reduction in the sense of control over the pain experience, which has been described earlier, is likely to magnify the experience of pai n (58). Research focused on the interactions between emotion, attenti on, memory and pain has greatly increased our understanding of the strong connection between these states but has equally underscored the complexity of these relationships. SECTION 1 17 Physiological responses The central autonomic system spans an extensive network of interconne cted neurons across a range of regions of the central nervous system ( CNS ), which include but are not limited to the insular and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the PAG, the parabrachial nucleus, and the me dullary ra phe nuclei (86). These areas of the CNS receive ascending nociceptive and visceral signals from the periphery in addition to collateral neural data from other regions of the CNS. This conver gence of neuro -signalling provokes specific patterns of autonomic response which are transmitted to preganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons to generate peripheral responses. These responses are extensive and involve but are not limited to reg ulation of temperature, blood flow, fluid and electrolyte balance, circadian rhythm and sleep/wake cycles, stress responses, arousal and gastrointestinal activity (87). These centres are also key to descending modulation of pain and the autonomic system plays an important role in these processes (87). The interactions and results of this network of signalling depend to a large extent on the origins of the noxious stimuli and therefore the pathway and where the signal terminates , which will influence the autonomic, endocrine and emotional response that results from the noxious stimuli (87). For example , somatic, cutaneous pain is relayed to the lateral PAG via the dorsal horn and provokes descending signals designed to provoke a 'fight' or flight' response to 'escapable stimuli' (86). This stimulates sympathetic activity to increase blood flow to the face and the legs, heart rate and blood pressure. An increase in muscle contraction and anxiety is also seen with sympathetic activity associated with pain. M any of these responses intensify pain and the unpleasantness but likely served an evolutionary purpose to prompt action to reduce the risk of further injury. In contrast, 'non -escapable' poorly localised deep somatic or visceral stimuli terminates in the v enterolateral PAG which sends descending signals to the parasympathetic system to reduce heart rate, blood pressure and activity (86). Autonomic and pain modulatory responses tri ggered by noxious stimuli are also controlled peripherally by triggering of preganglionic autonomic effector neurons at the same spinal segment as the afferent signal. These signals generate somatosympathetic and viscerosympathetic reflexes, which include increased innovation to the blood vessels of the head, face and neck, the lacrimal and nasal mucosa (86). Pain signals that reach the hypothalamus are also responsible for a cas cade of neuroendocrine responses. The first of which is the release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), gonadal releasing hormone and thyroid releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. These hormones act SECTION 1 18 on the anterior pituitary and stimulate the rele ase of hormones that act on the end glands of this cascade: the thyroid and adrenal glands and the gonads cortisol, pregnenolone, dehydroepaindrostone, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone and thyroxine (88). These hormones have a range of actions that f eed pain modulation and they include; immune and anti - inflammatory activity, glucose control, modulation of CNS receptors and nerve conduction and control of the blood brain barrier (88). Behavioural responses Guarding and withdrawal from a source of potential or actual tissue damage and avoidance of activities that provoke pain are examples of behavioural response s aimed at reducing pain (89). Some behaviours are learned while others are a reflex response to painful stimulus and there is some recent evidence to suggest that the relationship between behavioural responses and pain perception may in fact be bidirectional where behaviours also influence perception (89). Nociceptive signals reach the dorsal horn via A -fibres which have projections that synapse with spinal interneurons and motor efferent fibres in addition to the ascending projections. The motor signals are responsible for ipsilateral flexion of muscles to cause withdrawal from the painful stimulus and a con tralateral response to provide postural support. There is a complex descending modulation of these reflexes and if this pathway is damaged flexion reflexes occur in response to non-noxious stimuli (90). The inclination to rub a painful area of the body is also an example of the way in which behaviour may help to alleviate pain. Melzack and Wall's Gate theory of pain is thought to explai n the physiology behind this behaviour and how it may play a part in t he modulation of the pain experience (91). This is described in section 2.1.3. In some instances behaviours will increase the experience of pain and this is most obvious in the setting of chronic pain where avoidance behaviours have been s hown to contribute to long -term increases in pain (58). Behaviours are also used to communicate pain to others and this is achieved most obviously by the pain related changes that occur to facial expression. Communication of pain may result in behaviours in others that reduce the individual's pain or their suffering, e.g. the provision of sympathy, helping with activities etc. The social significance of pain gave rise to the social communication model of pain which will be described briefly in the next secti on (92, 93) . SECTION 1 19 Pain theories The complexity of pain proces sing and the pain experience has led researchers to propose several theoretical frameworks or theories to explain the numerous clinical and research observat ions made. Melzack and Wall's widely accepted Gate Control theory and the more recent pain matrix are described in this section (91). The social communication model concentrates on the social impact of pain and is used to explain our behav ioural responses to pain and this is also described in this section (92). Gate Control theory of pain The gate control theory was proposed in 1965 to explain inhibitory pain modula tion (91). Melzack and Wall proposed that complex interactions between inhibitory interneurons and the descending inhibitory tracts from higher centres occur within the dorsal horn to modulate transmission of the nociceptive signal. Simply put these authors proposed that signals from non -painful stimuli 'close the gate' to signals from painful stimuli. This theory postulates that A -fibres, which are similarly capable of fast transmission of signals to A -fibres but have a low activation th reshold and are responsive to non -noxious mechanical stimuli such as: light touch, modulate pain tr ansmission. It is proposed that the non -noxious stimuli transmitted by these fibres results in inhibition of the dorsal root nociceptor fibres preventing the m from transmitting noxious signals via C -fibres to the central nervous system. It is thought that this mechanism explains the impulse to rub an area of pain. Furthermore, this theory proposes that signals descending from the brain also have the capacity t o block transmission of ascending afferent signals (91). Pain matrix Observatio ns made of people experiencing phantom limb pain following cord transection or amputation of the limb and growing awareness of the complexity of the pain exp erience and the poor correlation between pain severity and injury served as the basis for Melzack's conceptual model to explain pain processing : the neuromatrix theory (94). He described an extensive network of neuronal connections between many areas of the brain, which have been described briefly in previous sections and include regions such as : the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and the insular, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices. These connections are genetically predetermined but remodelled by sensory input. The mat rix comprises loops of neurons between these structures t hat allow parallel processing of all signals from the body but converge repeatedly throughout the matrix to allow for interactions between the output products of processing. This SECTION 1 20 matrix perceives the body as a whole and processing and synthesis of signals through this network occurs in a characteristic pattern that is recognised as the neurosignature. Fundamental to this theory of pain is acceptance that the CNS is responsible for producing pain experience and not damaged tissue. Patterns of neuronal acti vity in the brain comprise a neurosignature for pain which is responsible for the sensory, affective and cognitive dimensions of the pain experience. These patterns may be triggered by noxious stimul i but may also be provoked under circumstances where ther e is no stimulus. They are also a function of genetic programming and integrated inputs from the brain which include factors other than those that stem directly from nociceptive pathways (94). New imaging modalities such as, functio nal magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have confirm ed the extensive network of structures throughout the brain that are active during a painful experience, which is consistent with the theory that it is a matrix of neurons and not a single centre responsibl e for pain experience. However, increasingly it is acknow ledged that this activity, although sensitive to pain , may not be specific (95) Social communication model The need to communicate pain to solicit assista nce from others has formed the basis for a model that Craig and colleagues have used to describe paediatric pain (92, 93) . They assert that self - report and behaviours that can be recognised by others as indicative of pain are a means to convey the individual 's experience to others and that pain is inherently a social experience. This model accounts for the sequencing of events that occur with pain experience and the social context in which pain is experienced. The s ocial communication model (SCM) of pain descr ibes the process for transducing the pain experience into a pain expression that can be interpreted by others to provoke a response. The pain experience of the child is the sum of the biological, psychological and social factors that influence pain perce ption (93). The complex interaction between these influences and their impact on processing of pain signalling in the brain has already been described in this chapter. T he second stage of this model involves the transduction of perception into expression , which is the sum of physiological and behavioural responses and the product of conscious and unconscious control. Pain expression manifests in numerous ways which is inf luenced by cognitive development. Infants express pain by behaviours such as: crying, changes in facial expression and other body movements. With increasing cognitive development children increasingly use language to express SECTION 1 21 pain. This model also recognise d a bidirectional relationship between experience and expression such that the expres sion of pain will also impact on the experience of pain (93). Stage three of this model involves the decoding of the expression by the observer (93). This is also based on a bidirectional relationship as the observer will interpret the expression based on their understanding of the expression and its relationship to pain. This will be influ enced by cultural, contextual, experiential, interpersonal characteristics and the emotional state of the observer (93). In turn, their response to the expression of pain will potentially modulate the experience an d/or expression of pain in the infant or child . For example, pain expression may elicit caring behaviours that result in removal of the painful stimulus or provision of pain -relieving interventions which reinforces the behaviours . Alternatively, a negative response to pain expression may prompt the child to inhibit their expression. Pain and the developing nervous system The traditionally held view that the nervous system of the neonat e was insufficiently developed for young babies to experience pain was r epeatedly challenged in the latter half of the last century. It is now accepted that neonates are born with functioning nociceptive pathways and do experience pain. However, evidence d emonstrates that there are some differences in these pathways and the re sponses of preterm and term neonates when compared to those of adults. Furthermore, exposure to pain during the neonatal period is likely to have a significant effect on the neural cir cuits responsible for pain processing (96). Unlike the afferent nociceptive p athways, the pathways involved in central descending modulation of affer ent signals, are not fully mature at birth. Preterm neonates exhibit evidence of more substantial immaturity in these pathways and the associated circuits (97, 98) . This renders these neonates more susceptible to p ain associated with stimuli during the neonatal period and to the long -term negative effects that result from exposure to noxious stimuli during the neonatal period (99). Activation of immature pathways provokes unique and exaggerat ed patterns of activation across multiple regions of the brain (97, 100) . Preterm inf ants al so show lower thresholds and greater reflex response to stimuli than term neonates (101) . Using electroencephalograp hy (EEG), r esearchers pathways able to distinguish between noxious and tactile stimulus are present at 35 -37 weeks gestation (97, 102, 103). However, infants younger than 33 weeks post conceptional age show heightened touch sensiti vity and there is evidence that non -painful stimuli such as nappy changing trigger similar SECTION 1 22 stress responses to noxious stimuli such as needle procedures and that exposure to these procedures sensitises infants such that painful procedures are more painful when they follow non - invasive handling procedures (104, 105) . Studies of older children show both hyper -reactivity and hypo -reactivity in adolescents exposed to noxious stimuli who were born very prematurely . The type of pain and the duration of the pain stimulus has been shown to influence the extent and direction of the effect on reactivity (96). Noxious stimuli provoke behavioural responses in preterm and term neonates which include withdrawal and changes in facial expression (106) . Observation of these responses reveals differences from those seen in adults and subtle differences between preterm and term neonates implying changes in these pathways or modulati on of these r esponses associated with maturation. Although neonates , like adults , demonstrate flexor muscle activity and withdrawal from a stimulus the duration of the response is longer, is seen on the contralateral side, is likely to provoke a stronger p hysical respo nse and may be provoked by other tactile stimuli (106) . These differences become increasingly more apparent with decreasing gestational age. Data from electro physiological studies confirm electrophysiological differences associated with these behaviours. For example; inhibitory signalling is weaker in neonates than adults which goes some way to explaining the stronger reflex seen in neonates. Additionally, with increasing g estational age, the dorsal horn circuits demonstrate increased spatial organisation and therefore capacity to localise sensory data and reduced sensitivity to stimuli and therefore greater specificity for nociceptive stimuli (106) . Pain also provokes a brain stem reflex which results in consistent changes in facial expression in neonates which have been described as the 'primal face of pain' (107) . Although facial expression is not identical between individuals, very similar patterns of expression are seen across genders and cultures (107) and are common from infancy to adultho od (108) . Evidence shows that facial reflex respons e develops early in the foetus and is present even in the setting of significant damage to white brain matter (106) . However, with increasing age facial expression comes u nder increasing conscious control and is modified by signals from areas of the brain responsible for emotions (106) . Children as young as eight years have been shown capab le of suppressing expressions of pain or faking pain expressions using the same changes in expression associated with genuine pain (albeit the expression is often exaggerated) (109) . Haemodynamic studies have imp roved our understanding of th e role of the cerebral cortex in pain processing in preterm and term neonates. Seminal work using near -infrared spectroscopy , functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) and EEG have demonstrated activity in the neonatal cor tex following noxious stimuli confirming that noxious signals reach the brain (95, 97, SECTION 1 23 103, 110 -112). Goksan and colleagues' work reveal s an active network in the neonate that includes 18 of the 20 regions of the a dult brain excited by noxious stimuli (112) . It is revealing to note that noxious signalling in the neona te does not reach the amygdala or the orbitofrontal cortex, centres that play a significant role in the affec tive responses to pain. Furthermore, many of these regions are activated by any salient stimuli (95). With increasing gestational age, the capacity to distinguish between tactile and noxious stimuli increases. Co nversely, several regions are only active in the neonatal brain and they include : bilateral parietal lobe, pallidum and precuneus cortices, hippocampus and caudate nucleus (112) . These studies also highlight more extensive bilateral activity and more widespread connections in the neonatal brain when compared with the adult brain. Electrophysiological studies confirm event related potentials in the somatosen sory cortex which is age specific (106) . The interpretation of the significance of the differences in brain activity and how this relates to the adult response to pain rem ains unclear. Central sensitisation and th e long -term effects resulting from triggering of nociceptive pathways by nociceptive stimuli in the developed nervous system is well established (96). Increasingly, laboratory and clinical studies have revealed the impact of noxious stimuli on the highly plastic neonatal nervous system and the long -term outcomes of noxious stimuli. In studies using animal models, long -term outcomes are most often defined in adulthood as changes to either; baseline sensory sensitivity or responsiveness to noxious stimuli (96). The type and intensity of the stimulus, the region of the nervous system triggered and the post -delivery age of the neonate have all been shown to influe nce the extent of the long -term impact of noxious stimuli (98). The w ork of a number of research teams has also revealed a strong connection between neonatal pain and alterations in sensitivity and response to noxious stimuli in later life . Interestingly, similar patterns have als o been seen when neonates are exposed to mat ernal separation and stress (96). Research has focused on several cohorts to explore the effects of noxious stimuli on human infants. A systematic review of 13 studies examining the impact of neonatal pain exposure on developmental ou tcomes in children born preterm reported that the numb er of painful procedures were associated wit h alterations in early and later adverse developmental outcomes including negative impact on growth, cortical processing, and behaviour (13). Neonates and very young infants who experience circumcision have been shown to demonstrate increased pain behavi ours in response to infant immunisations tha n their uncircumcised counterparts (10, 11) . The long - term outcomes of early exposure to sur gery are likely to include changes in peripheral and central pain processing. Results from studies are inconsistent and predictable patterns are not apparent. However, the impact of surgery probably depends on multiple factors which include; the site and extent of the surgery, the age of the infant at the time of the surgery and the post -operative pain SECTION 1 24 management received (99). Infants suffering burns are another cohort studied to determine the effect of noxious stimuli on later pain e xperience and altered mechanical and pain sensitivity has been shown in adolescents who suffered a burn in infancy (113) . Classification of pain The heterogeneity of the pain experience has led to multiple systems of classification for pain. The distinction between nociception and pain is at the core of one these systems and is based on the aetiology of pain: defin ing it as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain has already been describe but in short is considered the pain associated with noxious stimulus (33). Neuropathic pain is initiated by nervous system dysfunction that causes excess and/or disproportionate stimulation of nociceptive pathways or decreases the inhibitory action of neural pathways. The result of which is an imba lance in painf ul and non -painful input causing the sensation of pain in the absence of a potentially or actual noxious stimuli. The IASP states that for pain to be considered neuropathic a demonstrable lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system is necessary (33). Pain is also categorised based on the duration of the pain e.g. acute or chronic, although this classification often includes an aetiologica l component. D efinitions vary but clinically , acute pain is most often considered pain of short term duration (less than 3 months), associated with recognisable pathology and resolves within an expected time frame; e.g. resolution of the pathological state (15). In contrast chronic pain is pain that lasts beyond 3 months and the expected time of healing. Furthermore, the mechanisms are lik ely to be different to those associated with the original disease or injury. In keeping with the link to the underlying patho logy, acute pain is generally considered adaptive as it serves to change behaviours to avoid tissue injury while chronic pain is of ten described as maladaptive as there is no demonstrable biological value to the individual (114) . The principle of this is sound b ut in practice the classification of acute versus chronic is not as easily applied. Healing occurs at varying rates within an d between lesions and between individuals and the relationship with the symptom of pain is not always consistent. The presence or a bsence of pain may not be associated with the progress of healing e.g. scar formation and maturation is generally painless an d in other circumstances complete healing may not be possible e.g. chronic rheumatological disease (115) . This underlies the relianc e on a logically but somewhat arbitrarily derived time frame for differentiating acute f rom chronic pain. Cancer -related pain is the most frequently used disease -related pain classification. However, cancer pain does not describe a single pain experience. Cancer -related pain encapsulates disease SECTION 1 25 and treatment related pain, pain originating from differing aetiology and pathology , acute and chronic pain and nociceptive and neuropathic pain. In addition, it is often heavily influenced by temporal factors, mos t notably the potential fear and distress that stems from a diagnosis of cancer (116) . More detail ed discussion of this complex symptom is beyond the scope of this summary. Assessment and measurement of pain Clinicians and researchers strive for ways to assess and measure pain in patients to guide management or measure study outcomes. Most often the c haracteristic of interest is pain intensity and method s to quantify pain intensity , even though this may oversimplify the overall experience of pain . More correctly, pain assessment should include review of the location, nature, quality, functional impact and emotional features of pain. However, in this section the focus will be on the methods used to assess and quantify pain in tensity. As pain has been increasingly acknowledged as 'what -ever the patient says that it is, existing whenever th ey say it does' (117) , self -report has in turn increasingly been viewed as the 'gold standard' for assessment. Tools that al lowed the individual to provide an estimate of the intensity of their pain using numeric scales or ordinal verbal scales that imply quantity using terms such as: mild, moderate and severe are widely used for clinical and research purposes. The visual analo gue scale (VAS) was developed to quantify subjective experiences and is an early example of a numeric scale used to self -report and quantify pain intensity (118) . This scale us es the now widely accepted 0 to 10 metric for this purpose where '0' represents 'no pain' and '10' represents the 'most severe pain '. In recent years conventional thinking has been challenged and experts have redefined self -report as ideal but not necess arily the gold standard for pain assessment (119) . This shift reflects growing concern about the oversimplification of pain assessment based exclusively on intensity and the lack of congruence in some circumstances between self-reported pain and evidence from other sources e.g. denial of pain where pathology would suggest severe pain and conversely reports of extreme pain to affect a spec ific outcome such as work avoidance etc. Concerns about accepting self-report as a gold standard for assessment of pain intensity are particularly obvious in children. The cognitive development of children may restrict their understanding of numbers making their assessment using a number -based scale unreliable (120) . Graphical tools have been developed as an alternative. These scales use a combination of numbers and images to represent increasing p ain intensity. Several self -report scales designed for children use facial images representing expression s intended to align with the intensity of pain (121) . Most commonly these scales are SECTION 1 26 comprised of six faces the first representing a score of '0' and subsequent faces an increase in pain in increments of '2' with a maximum score of '10' (120) . Use of scales of this type is not without c riticism. It cannot be assumed that these scales provide interval or ratio data despite each face having a numeric label (122) . This has significant implications for interpreting the scores reported by children using these scales. It ha s been suggested that the use of the face and inclusion of numbers on the scale serves to confuse the affective features o f pain with intensity (123) . Furthermore, the style and expression of the faces varies across different versions of these scales and there is evidence to show that this influences the way child, particularly young children sc ore their pain using these scales (121) . This is seen most clearly in results that show a propensity for young children to allocate higher scores when using a scale with a smiling face for no -pain. Althou gh, children as young as 4 years are considered able to self -report pain (124) , there is also evidence that question the capacity of children 3 to 5 years to provide meaningful report when using 6 -point self -report scales (125) . They demonstrate a propensity to select the end points of these scales and are considered likely to better manage a scale with fewer options e.g. three choices corresponding to 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe'. For a range of reasons individuals are not always able to self-report pain intensity. This includes infants and young children who are developmentally unable to communicate and/or understand the necessary concepts to apply an ordinal scale. S imilarly, individuals with congenital or acquired cognitive impairment m ay also have difficulty understanding the scale and its application to their experience of pain. Language barriers and serious illness also make a potentially significant contribution to impairing an individual's ability to self -report. Alternative methods to self -report for quantifying pain intensity have been developed to meet the needs of these groups. The next sections address methods of assessment such as: physiological measures, imaging and electrophysiological studies and observational behavioural sc ales which have been used or are proposed as an alternative to self -report. Imaging and electrophysiological studies Imaging and electrophysiological studies have been the basis for g reat advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of nociceptive pathways and pain signalling. They have also been proposed as a potential means to assessing pain. A range of techniques have been studied for this purpose and which will be discussed briefly in this section. They include electroencephalography (EEG), nea r infra -red spectroscopy (NIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). SECTION 1 27 EEG provides a non -invasive method for measuring cortical brain activity by measuring small electrical currents generated by postsynaptic potentials (48). It is proposed that as this method c an be used to map the activity of areas of the brain active foll owing painful stimuli such a s, the somatosensory cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex , therefore it could be used to support pain assessment. Researchers have worked to demonstrate the capacity of this modality to localise parts of the brain involved i n pain processing (126) and to show that currents correlate with the stimulus intensity and subjective experience (126, 127) . Furthermore, i t has been shown that the EEG waves are modulated by factors that impact on pain such as attention (128, 129) and placebos (130, 131) . Fernandez and colleagues demonstrate d a difference in EEG activity in infants exposed to noxious heel stroking randomised to receive water compared with those randomised to receive glucose (132) . Furthermore, those that receive d glucose showed no cha nge in their EEG before and after the stimuli while those that did not receive glucose demonstrated EEG activity consistent with noxious stimuli. These results are evidence of the capacity of this modality to assess and differentiate pain. However, they ar e at odds with results from a later study by Norman and colleagues (133) . In this study, the authors reported c lear differences in pai n scores (Prema ture Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) ) based on group allocation (glucose or placebo and/or procedure type). However, no meaningful differences in EEG activity were seen across groups or before and after the stimuli (133) . More recently, Slater and colleagues have reported results that are comparable to those of Fernandez and colleagues . (103) . In a small cohort o f infants, the EEG recordings of the infants' baseline activity and their responses to a tactile and a painful stimulus were compared. The results of these comparisons allowed the authors to conclude that nociceptive -specific activit y occurs in infants and can be detected by EEG. However, in line with findings by Norman and colleagues , Slater and colleagues also demonstrated in a small subgroup of infants enrolled in a larger RCT that EEG activity did not differ between infants receiving sucrose compared to water during a heel lance. The capacity for the EEG to distinguish between painful and non -painful stimuli in a sample of neonates experiencing heel lance and touch has also been sh own in Worley's work (134) . Although, perhaps it is accepted that painful stimuli cr eate a unique electrical signature that can be recorded using EEG it is un clear how this relates to the characteristics of the pain experience, i.e. the intensity of the pain. This area of study is still relatively new, and further work is required to asce rtain if EEG activity is a useful measure of pain in newborns. Near infr ared spectroscopy provides a measure of haemoglobin oxygenation by passing two infrared lights of different wavelengths through the tissue (135) . Light is variably absorbed which enables measurement of concentration changes in deoxygenated and oxygenated haemoglobin SECTION 1 28 and therefore calculation of blood volume. Therefore, it has been used to p rovide an estimate of blood flow to body tissues, including the brain (135) . It was us ed as long ago as 1995 as an indirect measure of cortical activity in response to noxious stimuli in an RCT by Bucher and colleagues who tested the effect of glucose on pain associat ed with heel lancing (136) . The changes in cerebral blood flow, measured by NIRS, was a secondary outcome of this study. Significant differences in heart rate and crying time between groups were reported. In contrast, no difference in cerebral blood flow between groups was reported. The obvious paradox betw een the outcome measures would suggest that cortical blood flow to areas of the brain responsible for pain processing and pain experience are not synonymous and therefore that this measurement may not be useful for assessing pain. In mo re recent years rese archers have reported results that are consistent with or challenge those of Bucher's study leaving some uncertainty about the role of NIRS in assessment of pain (137, 138) . A team at Universi ty College London have made significant contributions to our understanding of cortical processing of pain in neonates and imaging techniques that may be useful for clinical assessment of pain. In their 2006 study, infan ts were studied using NIRS to measure cerebral oxygenation over the somatosensory cortex during a heel lance (111) . A clear increase in cerebral oxygenation in the contralateral cortex was demonstrated in infants aged between 25 and 45 weeks postmenst rual age. The contralateral response was greater in awake infants and increased with age. Furthermore, latency in response also changed with age. This response to noxious stimuli was in stark contrast to what was seen associated with non -noxious tactile st imulation where there was no increase in cerebral activit y in the contralateral somatosensory cortex even in infants that exhibited reflex withdrawal from the stimulus. Bartocci and colleagues reported similar results to those of the University College Lon don team (110) . Haemodynamic changes in the somatosensory cortices of 28 to 36 -week gestational aged neonates subjected to venepuncture and tactile stimulus also demonstrated patterns specific to procedure type. The results of a study examining the cerebra l haemodynamics and behavioural responses to painful stim uli in critically ill infants following cardiac surgery also reported a positive association between pain scores and cerebral activation demonstrated by NIRS and similar responses in both measures to analgesic administration (139) . In another study from the University College London group, Slater and colleagues compared cortical activity with observational pain scores (PIPP) in neonates aged 25 to 45 weeks postmenstrual following a heel lance (137) . Correlatio n between the two was good and the 'facial expression' item of the behavioural scale correlated most strongly. However, cortical responses (measured by NIRS) were seen in infants that did not demonstrate a change in facial expression. The authors conclude that some infants may be in pain d espite a low behavioural pain score. SECTION 1 29 However, this conclusion, based on a small subgroup of infants has been criticised by some researchers and may highlight a potential disconnect between pain experience and current mappi ng of neural activity associated w ith painful stimulus. Two studies in infants exposed to skin breaking procedures also challenge the validity of NIRS used a s a measure of pain perception. These studies reported no correlation between pain scores and cort ical activation (140, 141) . Bembich and colleagues explored the effects of breast feeding and glucose on the pain associated with heel lance (142). Their results demonstrat ed no significant changes in cortical activity associated with glucose administration but higher pain scores than were seen in bre ast fed infants. Furthermore, cortical activation occurred in breast fed infants during heel lance . In a third study, an RCT t o determine the impact on the pain associated with heel lance of three different non -pharmacological interventions, results were also inconsistent (143) . The heart rate of the preterm infants in creased in response to the stimulus for all treatment groups. In contrast peripheral oxygen saturation and NIRS measurements did not change following heel lance . Studies have also used NIRS in adult populations which provides a unique opportunity to corr elate cortical activ ity with self -report of pain , an opportunity denied neonatal researchers. Using an experimental pain stimulus, Azar demonstrated a correlation between self -reported pain and cortical activity demonstrated by increases in cerebral oxygen ation (144) . Similarly, increases in cerebral oxygenation were seen during nociceptive procedures in adults undergoing cardiac surgery in the work of Gelinas and colleagues (145) . How ever, no correlation existed between cerebral oxygenation changes, pain behaviours and self -reported pain intensity. There are clearly still gaps in our understanding of the relationship between cortical activation in response to painful stimuli measured by NIRS and pain experience. Furthermore, as with all indicators of pain, NIRS does not fully explain the experience of pain . Research teams continue to use this modality to map cortical activity of the brain in response to painful and non -painful stimuli and expl ore the relationship between this mapping and other assessment modalities to better appreciate its potential role as an assessment tool (97, 134, 146, 147) . Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is another imaging technique that has been increasingly used in the quest to better unde rstand supraspinal activity associated with pain. By measuring changes in blood flow, fMRI indirectly measures neural activity in the brain (48). To achieve this, fMRI uses one of two approaches , detect ion of the difference in magnetic susceptibility between oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood (blood oxygen level -dependent (BOLD) imaging) or trac ing of magnetically labelled endogenous water through the cerebral SECTION 1 30 circulation (48, 148) . The choice of approach depends largely on temporal factors. The first approach is used to image acute s hort-term experiences of pain and is the focu s of the following discussion. Although, t he literature includes studies that confirm a predictable and consistent pattern of activation of centres in the brain in association with painful stimulus (112, 149 -153), infants are the focus of only two of these studies (112, 153) . Williams and colleagues used experimental pain in a recent study of full -term infants to determine the fe asibility of using fMRI to measure brain activity in response to a range of mechanical stimuli (153) . Speci fic patterns of activation resulted from different stimuli and activation increased in response to the inte nsity of the stimulus. The authors concluded that fMRI shows promise as a potential measure of neural processing of mechanical stimuli. The regions o f the brain activated by pain in neonates were compared with those of adults by Goksan and colleagues and t here was considerable overlap. This was described in Section 2.1.4 of this chapter (112) . These results are considered evidence that infant perception of pain is also likely to o verlap that of adults. Neuroimagin g and haemodynamic studies have allowed scientists to make great leaps in our understanding of brain activity associated with pain. Accepting that these modalities provide a valid measure of a pain is predicated on accep ting that the patterns of activity c onsistently associated with pain represent pain experience. Observations have been made that cast doubt on this premise. Salamons and colleagues reported the same patterns of neural activity to painful stimulus in indivi duals with congenital insensitivity to pain as control individuals (154) . Similarly, the conflicting results reported in studies using NIR S raise questions about what neurolo gical activation tells us about pain experience. Finally, these modalities require specialised equipment and significant patient preparation rendering them impractical for use in circumstances other than research designe d specifically to explore neuronal a ctivity. Physiological measures Use of p hysiological parameters such as: heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturations as a measure of pain intensity is based on an assumption that these measure s change predictably with changes in pain intensity. As has been described, noxious stimuli and pain signalling trigger autonomic responses which result in changes in these physiological parameters. A systematic review conducted in 2011 to determine how ef fective physiological parameters are as indicators of neonatal pain included seven RCTs where these parameters were used as a measure of pain (155) . Heart rate was the most frequently used of these and results were inconsistent; in some studies heart rate changes in response to pain were corroborated by other SECTION 1 31 measures of pain intensity while in others th is was not the case. Although not in cluded in this systematic review, results from other studies show similar inconsistencies in the way these indices respond to painful stimuli (156-171). Raeside and colleagues concluded that these physiological indices do not show sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be used as an independent indicator of pain (155) . They also reiterate the conclusion drawn several years earlier by Steven s and colleague that although these parameters may change in response to pain potentially making them useful indices to detect pain, th ey are unlikely to be specific for pain or able to quantify pain intensity (172) . Studies have al so evaluated these parameters when paired with other observable measures such as behaviours to assess the capacity of a composite of indices to estimate pain intensity. Results are mixed as to their additive value and in some circumstances the internal val idity of the scale is not improved by the addition of physiological measures. The COMFORT scale designed by van Dijk and colleagues (173) is an example where heart rate and blood pressure item s were removed from a subsequent iteration of this scale following internal reliability testing to determine the contribution of physiological and behavioural items to the scale (COMFORT -B scale) (174) . Biochemical markers have also been explored as a potential surrogate for self -report of pain . The biochemical markers . Increased levels of these biochemical markers have been linked to pain in animal and human models. However, it remains unclear what ro le these markers may play in the detection of pain and it seems unlikely that they can be used as an estimate of pain intensity. Furthermore, many of these mark ers are located in the dorsal root ganglia or the spinal cord making sampling procedurally diffi cult and associated with significant risk of harm (175) . Cortisol is anot her biochemical marker linked to the cascade of neuroendocrine responses to painful stimuli. It is released by the adrenal glands in response to stress (88). Salivary co rtisol levels correlate well with serum cortisol levels providing a simple, non -invasive way of sampling this marker (176) . This has led to research interest in its potential role in pain assessment . Increases in cortisol levels associated with immunisation (177-179) and surgical procedures (180, 181) have been reported in multiple studies. Zhao and colleagu es reporte d rises in salivary cortisol in children with cerebral palsy undergoing painful therapies which were corroborated by pain scores (182) . A study designed to assess the effect of pet therapy ( the presence of a therapy dog) on the pain associated with venepuncture reported a reduction in self -reported distress and salivary cortisol levels but not in self -reported pain associated with the presence of the dog (183) . SECTION 1 32 In contrast, Ha and Kim reported lower pain and affective responses to pain in the experimental group of their RCT but no difference in salivary cortisol levels (184) . A positive correlation between salivary cortisol levels and postoperative morphine consumption was shown in an RCT of children randomised to receive varying levels of information prior to surgery (181) . Morelius and co lleagues reported lower increases in infants receiving glucose and a pacifier for the immunisation (179) . At odds with these results are those of a study examining premature infant responses to routine heel lance s which r eported no rise in salivary cortisol in response to the heel lance (185). Hansen also reported no significant difference in cortisol levels, despite significant differences in pain scores between groups randomised to either sequential or simultaneous immunisatio ns (178) . Finally, data from a 2005 study by Grunau and colleagues also demonstrated lower cortisol levels following cumulative exposu re to painful procedures (186) and in preterm neonate compared with term neonates (187) . The results across studies are not consistent and salivary cortisol levels vary widely making it impossible to accept cortisol levels as sensitive or specific meas ures of pain. Skin conductance is another physiological measure of stress that has been explored as a potential measure of pain. It is accepted that changes in electrical conductance in the skin occur in response to changes in activity of the sweat gland s which is media ted by changes in sympathetic activity and that therefore skin conductance is an indirect measure of neuro -physical arousal (188) . This has served as the impetus of several research groups to evalua te skin conduction as a potential means to detect pain (188-201). Storm has led a body of work across several centres to test the capacity of t his modality to measure stress and more specifically pain. Early work i n adults demonstrated increased fluctuations in skin conductance associated with perioperative stress (202, 203) . This was followed by two studies confirmi ng correlations between patient -reported postoperative pain scores and the number of fluctuations in skin conductance (204, 205) . Similarly, e arly data in infants showed promise (189, 206 -209). However, researchers are not without reservations about these findings . Harrison and colle agues reported significant increases in skin conductance during a heel lance procedure (189) . However, in the same study there was no significant di fference in skin conductance changes between infants undergoing a heel lance and those experiencing routine nursing care. Erikson and colleagues tested this modality on premature infants exposed to painful and non -painful stimuli and although they reported the capacity for skin conductance to differentiate b etween stimuli, they echoed Harrison's call for more data before this technology is accepted as a valid measure of pain (206) . Gunther and colleagues reported rises in skin conductance associated with painful stimulus. H owever, similar rises in motor activity associated with this stimulus led them to suggest that fluctuations in skin conductance may be better for detecting emotional distress than pain (209) . SECTION 1 33 These physiological measures all suffer the same limitation as to their specificity f or pain. These parameters are responsive to physiological stress and pain is only one trigger for stress. A physiological stress response may also be triggered by illness, emotional distress and other aversive emotions etc. Therefore, these experiences are likely to result in similar physiological changes as those seen in pain. This may in part go some way to explaining the inconsistencies in the results of studies , particularly those that concentrate on cortisol levels. The participants in many studies are experiencing a range of stress -related triggers in addition to pain. Studies exploring the effect of early painful procedures on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HLA) axis function in later infancy illu strate the complex relationship between pain and stress (210, 211) . Physiological and biochemical markers are not sufficiently specific to pain to make them a useful unidimensional measure of the presence and intens ity of pain. Behavioural pain scales Behavioural pain scales are one of the most commonly used and most practical methods for pain assessment. The premise behind these scales is that observable behavioural responses to pain are consistent and predictab le rendering them suitable surrogate measures of pain (212). This has given rise to the development of nearly 50 uniq ue scales for pain measurement in infants and children (213) . Specific scal es considered likely to be suitable for assessment of procedural pain in infants and children will be described in the body of the thesis. This section will describe scales in terms of overall t ype and design and highlight those that have been recommended specifically for procedural pain assessment in infants and children . Measure type Behavioural pain scales are most commonly either checklists, rating scales or global rating scales (30). Checklists are comprised of a set of behaviours, which are assessed dichotomously as either present or absen t. The pain intensity score is based on the number of pain -related behaviours present during the observation period. These scales are easily applied and relatively unambiguous and lend themselves well to clinical use. However, these scales lack the capacit y to acknowledge the intensity of behaviours or to give some b ehaviours greater weighting (30). Rating scales include behavioural indices that are individually rate d based on the intensity, frequency or duration of the observed behaviour. The sum of the item scores is the pain intensity score. These scales allow for assigning variable weighting to behaviou rs and are potentially more sensitive to subtle changes in pai n intensity (30). Well -designed rating s cales provide clear descriptors for behaviours of increasing i ntensity and simple metrics for scoring individual items, making them SECTION 1 34 only marginally more difficult to use than checklists but better suited to more precise measurement . Global rating scales, such as the visual analogue scale (VAS), although not usually designed as an observational pain scale, have been increasingly used to assess pain in those unable to self - report their pain intensity. An observer provides a global rating of pain intensity b ased on their perception of the intensity of pain exper ienced by the infant or child. The anchors used for these scales quantify the intensity in words or numbers but do not describe behaviours. For example, the VAS is a graphical scale that uses a line wi th anchors at each end defined as 'no pain' and 'worst pain' while other global scales include otherwise undefined increments of 1 or 2 between the 0 and 10 anchors at either end (30). Global rating scales are very quickly and easily applied. However, they are criticised for the impact on scoring of observer bias (30). Observers' perception of pain intensity will potentially be variably influenced by specific behaviours, experience, circumstantial factors such as the administration of analgesics and familiarit y with the infant or child. Design The specificity and sensitivity of behavioural responses can be influenced by contextual factors (214) , which has been the driver for development of measures designed to assess pain in either specific populations and/or under specific circumstances. Available scales can be grouped accord ing to their design purpose, some of the most common of which are scales for acute, chronic and disease specific pain, neonates and children with cognitive impairment There are recognised differences between acute and chronic pain that are likely to be reflected in pain-related behaviours of infants and children experiencing acute pain or chron ic pain (30). With this in mind, measures are designed to assess one or the other; acute or chronic pa in. Many of those developed for acute pain use were specifically developed for post-operative pain assessment , e.g. Children's Behaviour Coding System PACU (CBCS -P) (215) Children's an d Infants' Postoperative Pain Scale (216) , the Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) (29) and the Face , Legs, Cry , Activity and Consolability (FLACC) scale . The FL ACC scale was the scale of choice for assessment of postoperative pain based on recommendations made in two systematic reviews published in 2007 (30, 31) . There has not been the same emphasis on developing scales for alternative acute circums tances such as procedural pain. Many of the scales developed for p ostoperative pain have been used in alternative circumstances and in the same systematic reviews, the FLACC scale and the CHEO PS were recommended for procedural SECTION 1 35 pain assessment (30, 31) . This is despite limited psychometric testing of these scales for this purpose. Disease -related tools also appear in the assessment literature, although most are designed as a measure for self -report of quality of life indicators including pain . Cancer related -pain receives the most attention. Infants and children experience both acute and chronic pain in association with the disease and its treatment. He nce, measures for acute procedural pain and chronic pain are used in this cohort. There is a lso acknowledgement of the significant affective responses to pain under these circumstances which has resulted in the development of scales such as the Observation al Scale for Behavioural Distress (OSBD) for procedural pain. In addition, the impact of pro longed pain has informed scales such as; Douleur Enfant Gustave Roussy, (DEGRR) Scale for prolonged pain in cancer (217) . It has been previously acknowledged that pain processing, specifically modulation, matures from approximately 25 weeks gestational age and that neuro -physical responses to pain vary with maturation. For this reason, scales that capture the nuances in behavioural responses to pa in in preterm and term neonates e.g. the PIPP (218) have been developed. However, even this population is not homogenous and there are likely to be significant differences in the responses exhibited by a 26 -week gestati on neonate in intensive care compared with those of a healthy term neonate (219) . Furth ermore, m ost of the tools developed were validated for assessing acute pain. Despite our understanding of their differ ences and increased interest in assessing neonatal pain, widely accepted recommendations regarding the most appropriate scale choice are n ot available. The PIPP scale has been studied most extensively and a systematic review by the scale developers in 2010 summarised the psychometric data available (220) . The authors conclude d that it is a valid and reli able option but more data to address the feasibility and clinical utility is needed. Assessment of pain in children with cognitive impairment has also been recognised as uniquely challenging as many of their behaviours are inconsistent with those of thei r normally developing contemporaries and it is likely that this includes their pain -related behaviours. Effort has been made to develop or modify existing scales to measure pain intensity in these children. Only a few scales have been purposefully designed for individuals with cognitive impairment and they include the Non -Communicating Child ren's Pain Checklist (NCCPC -PV) (221) and the revised version (222) , the Individualised Numeri c Rating Scale (INRS) (223) and the Pediatric Pain Profile (PPP) (224) . The FLACC scale is an ex ample of a scale designed originally for typically deve loping infants and children which has been adapted for use with children with cognitive impairment (225) . Crosta and colleagues reviewed available scales to make recommendations for SECTION 1 36 the scale best suited to assessi ng pain in hospitalised children with CI and they cautiously concluded that the revised FLACC was probably the most suitable (226) . Pain-related behaviours in critically unwell infants and children may also be sig nificantly modified by the circumstances where they are either too unwell or too heavily sedated to demonstrate the usual patterns of behaviour seen in infants and children in pain. Scales have been developed that recognise these limitations and include th e COMFORT scale (227) . The purpose of pain assessment is also likely to influence scale design. Scales developed for clinicians to support pain management decisions need to be easily and quickly understood and applied without extensiv e training. In contrast, scales used for research purposes may sacrifice ease of application in return for improved performance. There are several scales, such as the Child Facial Coding System (CFSC) (228, 229) , that require considerable expertise to apply and are more reliably applied to video recordings where repeated viewing is possible. Therefore, this scale and othe rs like it may be better suited to research use. Item selection Item selection is also key to the design of the scale and scale developers acknowledge several strategies to identify and rationalise the behavioural indices included in the measure. Many describe interrogating the literature or surveying experts as a means to identifying items considered representative of pain. Psychometric testing (discussed in detail in the next section) of the scale applied to the population and/or circumstances for whic h it was designed is used to validate their selection. In some studies methods to specifically assess the internal reliability of each item were employed to better understand the contribution that they make to the performance of the scale. Although the measures identified in the previous section all vary slightly there is considerable overlap and some behaviours appea r more frequently than others. Facial expression is one of the most common behavioural items to feature in observational scales. It is also the most extensively and independently researched of all behaviours thought to be indicative of pain. Early attempt s to define facial expressions associated with emotion w ere undertaken by Charles Darwin (230) and pursued again in the 1970s by Ekman and Friesen who provided a framework for identifying expressions (231) . They objectively coded individual muscle movements that occurred with a range of emotions into 'action units' and identified constellations of consistently occurring action unit s. Similar facial actions were seen across early studies assessing adult responses to experimental pain supporting the notion of a 'pain expression' (232-234). Furthermore, facial action units were not influenced by culture or the type of stimuli SECTION 1 37 (235) . In the pursuit of measures to accurately detect and rate pain intensity in infants and children too young to self -report, early paediatric pa in researchers recognised the potential for similar pain related expressions to be seen in infants and childre n. Grunau and Craig undertook pioneering work to detail specific facial actions seen in neonates experiencing pain associated with a heel lance (236) . The results of this study were used to inform their Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS). Similar efforts went in to developing a coding system for the facial expressions of preschool aged children which is a ptly known as the Child Facial Coding System (CFCS) (229) . Close inspection of the action units implic ated in pain expression for adults, children and neonates reveals some obvious similarities supporting the con tention that the face of pain is hardwired, universal and can be recognised across the life -span (108) . It has been suggested that this hardwired expression is a method for communicati ng infant' s needs to carers and this is the basis for the Social Communication Model of Infant Pain, which was described br iefly in section 2.1.3 of this chapter (92). Schiavenato and colleagues coined the term the 'primal face of pain' to capture the innate biologically determined capacity to communica te pain via facial expression (107) . Many research teams have since added to our understanding of the s ensitivity and specificity of facial expression for pain and the factors that influence expression associated with pain. Preterm and term neonatal facial expressions in response to pain are particularly well studied since Grunau and Craig's original work (107, 237 -244). In many cases, the original 9 -point scale has been reduced to a 3 or 4 -point scale using only the most commonly occurring facial expressions of pain (218, 236 ). A 2009 study aimed at testing the ca pacity of the NFCS to differentiate between painful and distressing procedures questions the specificity of the pain expression or at least the specificity of the NFCS (245) . Chang and colleagues focused their attention on the face item of six observational scales and the associa ted descriptors for these items (246) . Their aim was to determine the impact on observer judgement of different descriptors. Their results supported their hypothesis that descriptors that were inconsistent with empi rically derived descriptions of facial expression were associated with poor reliability. Despite evidence that consistent facial expressions are associated with pain in infants and children, this has not translated into consistent use of evidence based fac ial descriptors across observati onal measures. Furthermore, available data exploring facial expression is derived from studies using a n acute painful stimulus for pain. There are no studies that attempt to identify whether the 'pain expression' is the same with other types of pain e.g. p ostoperative and chronic pain. Cry is another behaviour that has traditionally been considered indicative of pain in infants and children and hence it features frequently in observational measures of pain intensity. Like fa cial SECTION 1 38 expression, cry has receive d research attention to determine whether it can be used to assess pain. Various characteristics of cry such as; latency to cry following exposure to a painful stimulus and the duration of cry following a painful stimulus, h ave been explored. Grunau and co lleagues reported significant differences in latency to cry and cry duration between infants having a painful or non -painful procedure (238) . In a second study by this team, temporal patterns were demonstrated: they reported significantly longer latency to cry for sleeping infants than awake neonates following heel lance (236) . Trials assessing the effectiveness of treatments to relieve pain associated with immunisations and needle -related procedures frequently use cr ying time as an outcome measure and results confirm that pain relief is likely to reduce crying time (247-250). However, predictable patterns that can be used for assessment of pain based on latency to cry or crying time are not available. The acousti c qualities of the cry have also been tested to examine a potential association with pain. Bellieni and colleagues demonstrated that neonates with higher pain scores during blood sampli ng also had a higher fundamental frequency (251) and Facchini reported more noise patterns in the sound spectrograms in infants with higher pain scores (252) . Decoupling between fundamental frequency and intensity contours during crying is considered to represent cortical control and therefore another potential way to indirectly measure pain . This relationship was explored in a study of neonates during heel lance and auth ors reported a trend towards a relationship between the extents of deco upling and pain scores. This infers a potential role for this analysis in pain assessment (253) . Lehr and colleagues reported that the power an d velocity of the cry (amplitude and rapidity) were stronger predictors of pain scores than f eatures of arousal (turbulence and intensity) and the pitch of crying (frequency characteristics) (254) . Positive correla tions between cough frequency associated with cry and pain scores and negative correlations between fundamental frequencies and pain scores were reported in term neonates during venepuncture (255) . In a study to examine patte rns in crying associated with anger, fear and pain, objective analysis did not identify a consistent pattern associated with each emotion and carers were unable to correctly identify the emotion that was the cause of the crying (256) . Furthermore, several research teams have reported variation within subjects and demonstrated that cry is also influenced by age (257) and age and gender (258) . Finally, the r esults of other studies do not provide a convincing case to suggest that the acoustic characteristics of cry could be used to detect pain or assess intensity (238, 259 -262) Like the studies exploring the associati on between facial expression and pain, studies focused on the characteristics of cry use a procedural pain model and concentrate on neonates. However, it is less likely that there is a consistent , predictable and universal cry response to pain. Analysis of results to date have not include d efforts to establish cut off values that might assist in SECTION 1 39 differentiating painful from non -painful stimulus , e.g. the duration of cry (seconds) following a stimu lus which would differentiate a tactile stimulus from a heel lance . This makes interpretation of a single infant's cry response almost impossible. It is likely, given the extent of the variability within infants and between infants, that cut offs with high levels of sensitivity and specificity do not exist. Pain mimics The challenge for clinicians and researchers is identifying measures that are not only sensitive to pain but are also specific. It has long been recognised that there is potential overlap b etween the responses seen with other negative emotions and ph ysiological arousal states and the responses associated with pain. A systematic review from 2007 highlights the paucity of data available that addresses the capacity of measures to discriminate b etween pain and other negative emotions (30). Since this review, Ahola Kohut and colleagues reported t he results of their study that aimed to determine the capacit y of the NFCS to distinguish between neonates experiencing a tactile stimulus and those experiencing a painful stimulus (245) . They concluded that the NFCS was unable to make this distinction. As has been described there is limited evidence to confirm the capacity of any of the assessment techniques explored (imaging, physiological or behavioural) to differentiate between pain and non -pain related distress. Von Bayer and Spagrud point out that scales are variably referred to as either a measure of pain, distress or pain and distress, despite similarities in the designs of these instruments and the similarities in their responsiveness to pain when tested (30). They stop short of recommending that all instruments are referred to as a measure of distress and not pain or pain and distress. However, Blount d id make this recommend ation and suggested t hat scales are uniformly considered distress scales (263) . This differentiation betwe en pain responses and other emotions can be particularly relevant for procedural pain where anticipatory fear and anxiety play a significant role in the experience. It has been suggested that pre -painful procedure distress is accepted as evidence of fear a nd anxiety and the procedural phase response as evidence of pain. Blount challenges this view based on data which demonstrate positive correlations between pre - procedural anxiety and procedural p ain. H is contention was that the behaviours seen in anticipat ion of and during the procedure are a chain of behaviours representing different intensities of pain-related distress rather than different emotions and may be explained by classic conditioning. Cues in the pre -procedural phase provoke a conditioned respon se which approximates the response associated with the original conditioning (e.g. painful procedure). SECTION 1 40 Blount likened this to 'Pavlov's dog' and suggested that anticipatory distress is analogous to procedural pain. Finally, children under the age of 8 to 9 years struggled to differentiate between the sensory experience of pain and their affective response to painful sensations in Goodenough and colleagues' study (264) . This adds weight to a contention that differe ntiation between pain and other negative emotions associated with procedures may well be fruitless as infants and children may not experience or recognise a meaningful difference between these experiences. Psychometric properties and pain scale testing Numerous indices of health cannot be measured directly and as a result instruments designed to approximate these indices have proliferated. This is particularly the case where the aim is to measure a subjective experience, such as pain. These instruments a re frequently comprised of multiple items and may take the form of self -administered questionnaires and scales or observational tools applied by clinicians and researchers. In this section the concepts that relate to the development of these instruments an d assessment of their perf ormance are described, particularly as they relate to observational pain scales. Instrument scales Medical science conventionally used categorical scales to measure the presence or absence of an attribute, typically a disease. Th e social sciences have tra ditionally used an approach felt to be better suited for attributes that are considered to exist on a continuum and instruments are designed to grade the magnitude or severity of the attribute and place individuals along this continuum. These scales use or dinal, interval and ratio scales. Unquestionably, pain intensity cannot be dichotomised and is best described on a scale that allows for multiple levels of intensity. Ideally the number of levels on a scale should reflect the ca pacity of the individual t o discriminate between these levels so as not to lose valuable information about the construct or to exceed the precision with which the individual perceives the attribute. There is evidence to suggest that across a range of const ructs individuals have dif ficulty perceiving more than seven (plus or minus two) levels and in the pain literature there is evidence that young children are unable to use traditional 6 -point scales (125) . Interesti ngly, t he reliability is lower for instruments with fewer categories and this becomes most obvious where there are fewer than seven categories (265) . SECTION 1 41 Respondents also show a preference for scales that include 5 to 9 categories and show a strong dislike for dichotomous scales, considering them less 'accurate' and 'reliable' and more 'ambiguou s' and 'restrictive' (265) . Performance testing Determining the diagnostic accuracy testing for measures where the results are either positive or negative uses methods where the results of the test of interest ('positive' and 'negative') are compared with the results of an existing test considered the 'gold standard. The results are then defined as representative of either a 'true' or 'false' result depending on whether they agree with the 'gold standard' and summarised in terms of sensitivity and specificity (266). This paradigm is only possible w here an accepted gold standard is available and furthermore where the results of the application of the test can be dichotomised. As has been noted, pain assessment for infants and young children experiencing a painful pro cedure does not meet either of the se criteria. For these measurement instruments to be useful for research and clinical practice, it is still essential to understand how well they perform. To achieve this, alternative methods to establish the measurement (psychometric) properties are emp loyed. Studies are designed to assess reliability, validity and/or the feasibility of using the instrument, in this case an observational pain scale, to measure the construct of interest (pain). It is tempting to consi der that reliability and validity are fixed and that results of psychometric testing describe the reliability or validity of the instrument. However, these properties are a function of the instrument's performance under the circumstances under which it was tested. This means that reliabili ty and validity are more rightly considered properties of the measurements and not the instrument. This is an important distinction as it underpins the need for assessment of the measurement properties in a range of circum stances to replicate the circumsta nces of intended use. These properties (reliability, validity and feasibility) and the ways in which they are tested, to establish the psychometrics of pain scales, are discussed in the next sections of this chapter. Reliability Reliability refers to the reproducibility of a measure when either the instrument is applied by different observers, on different occasions (where the true value is unchanged) or using similar or parallel tests. Measurements can be considered relia ble if these results are comparabl e. Reliability describes the proportion of the variability in scores which is due to true differences between SECTION 1 42 individuals and as such it is reported as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is 'no reliability' and 1 is 'perfect reliability' (265) . Reliability can also be described as a measure of the amount of random error in the measurements (267) . There are different ways in which reliability can be assessed and they include: internal reliability, test-retest reliability, intra -rater reliability and inter -rater reliability testing. Not all methods are relevant to all measurement instruments. For example, testing internal consistency is not possible for a single item instrument and inter -rater reliability is not applicable for self -administered instruments. In this section these approaches to reliability testing will be briefly described. Internal consistency measures the average correlation between items for multi -item instruments (265, 267) . The prem ise for this approach is that items measuring the same const ruct would be expected to correlate strongly. Conversely, if the correlation results are low it can be assumed that the items are either measuring different things or that respondents are inconsis tent across different items . Internal consistency is an impo rtant step in the development of new instruments with multiple items and will guide inclusion and exclusion of items. Poorly correlated items are removed and less obviously those achieving near pe rfect correlations may also be removed as they do not add a great deal to the instrument. Removal of the physiological items from the original CO MFORT scale (227) was in response to low internal valid ity for these items (268) and is an example of how internal consistency is used in scale desig n. Internal consistency is measured by testing a single application of the instrument by several observers and Cronbach's alpha is commonly used to analyse the result. However, there are limitations to this approach particularly where the instrument includ es large numbers of items, e.g. in excess of 15 (267) . Furthermore, this test does not account for variations in time or observers and therefore results may be falsely elevated and overestimate the extent of the re liability (267) . Test-retest reliability refers to the capacity of a test to provide similar results over time when the construct o f interest is considered unlikely to have changed (267) . The capacity to measure test - retest reliability and interpretation of the results are highly dependent on the stability of the construct of interest and the interval between the tests. For exampl e, personality traits are unlikely to change over time, so repeat application of an instrument designed to measure personality traits weeks later is unlikely to result in different outcomes unless the tool is unreliable. The interval between tests may also be influenced by recall of previous respons es. To overcome this, repeat applications are delayed until it is reasonable to consider that respondents will be unable to recall their response on the first test. The conventional interval is b etween 10 to 14 d ays (267) . In contrast, pain is dynamic, and intensity may change frequently making interpretation of test -retest reliability regardless of the interval impossible. SECTION 1 43 Inter -rater reliability measures the consistency achieved between observers when the instrume nt is not self -administered. Many heal th-related instruments are observational scales and as such will be applied by many different observers (researchers and clinicians). To have confidence in the results, it must be shown that when the instrument is appl ied by different observers , they make similar observations. Inter -rater reliability is tested by correlating the independent responses of different observers measuring the same patient using the same instrument. Ideally the timing of these observations is also the same to eliminate the possibi lity that the condition of the individual has changed (267) . Alternatively, intra -rater reliability describes the reliability or agreement between repeat measures by the same o bserver on separate occasions. Test-retest, intra -rater and inter -rater r eliability are calculated by correlating the results of the tests. The magnitude of the correlation coefficient is interpreted to determine reliability. There is considerable debat e about the most appropriate correlation test and the interpretation of the coefficients. Pearson's r has been used to calculate a correlation coefficient but there is increased acceptance that the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using a repeated measures analysis of variance assessing for absolute agreement is better sui ted as this account s for the bias between or among observers and multiple assessments of the same individual over time (267) . The interp retation of reliability is further complicated by the lack of an agreed standard for the magnitude of the correlation coefficient that defines acceptable reliability. This is in part a measure of the range of factors that impact on the value of the coeffic ient and therefore the interpretation of reliability. As reliability is calculated based on a ratio of var iability between subjects to total variability the magnitude of reliability coefficient for a heterogeneous sample will be much higher than for a more homogeneous sample with much lower between subject variability (265) . Interpretation o f the coefficient will also depend on the intended application of the instrument and whether this is simil ar to the circumstances under which it was tested and the importance of absolute agreement e.g. high stakes diagnoses such as cancer versus low stakes diagnoses such as minor injury (269) . There is growing interest in the Bland -Altman method for examining levels of agreement. Bland and Altman introduced this method about 20 years ago as an alternative to correlation coefficients which they considered inappropriate for comparing the agreement between two instruments (270) . They argued that high correlations reflect strong relationships between variables but not necessarily agreement. Perfect agreement is only achieved if we get the same results using the two different instruments. Perfect correlation occurs when there is consistent difference in scores using the two different instruments even if the scores are not the same e.g. the scores from application of one instrument are always half the other inst rument's score . Mathematically, SECTION 1 44 agreement can be expressed as X = Y whereas correlation can be summarised as X = aY + b (where 'X' represents the scores from instrument ' and 'Y' the scores from instrument Y, 'a' is the slope of the line and 'b' is the poi nt at which X cuts the Y axis ) (265) . The aim of the Bland -Altman approach is to dete rmine the extent of the difference between the scores from two instruments to establish whether this is clinically significant (270) . The first step in this approach is to plot the difference between the results from the two instruments against the mean of the results to visually demonstrate the between methods differences. The bias is estimated by the mean difference and the standard deviation of the differences. It would be expected that all differences would be within 2 standard deviations of the mean difference. These values are considered the upper and lower limits of agreement. They represent the extent to which the results of one instrument might vary from the other and the clinical significance of these values are used to determine whether the instruments can be considered interchangeable. The standard error and confidence intervals are calculated to report the precision of the estimated lim its of agreement . Validity Validity defines the extent to which the scores represent a true measure of the construct under investigation and whether scores accurately distinguish between individuals with higher or lower levels of the construct (265) . In other words, whether the instrument accurately measures what it purports to measure and appropriately discriminates between varying degrees of the construct . Using a pain intensity scale as an example, to consider scores valid individuals w ho score ' zero' should have no pain and in reverse individuals with no pain should score 'zero'. The sa me should be seen for high scores; they should reflect an experience o f high levels of pain. The reliability of scores also impacts on the assessment of validity as the maximum value for validity is limited by the reliability. This is expressed in the fol lowing equation; Validity max = (Reliability new test ) (Reliabili ty criterion ) (265) This means that if reliabilit y for the new test is low (e.g. 0.4 ), even if the reliability of the criterion to which it is compared is high (e.g. 0.9), the maximum value for validity will be limited by this and cannot exceed 0.6. Intuitively this makes sense as if something is not mea sured consistently by observers the n it is likely that the construct is also not measured accurately, in other words if the answers are not the same , they cannot both be right. SECTION 1 45 Traditional definitions of validity have included different types of validity and including: content, criterion and construct. More recently, the agreed understanding of validity acknowledges these are methods to test validity rather than different types of validity and that validity is demonstrated cumulatively and circumstantiall y using a range of methods (269) . Face and content validation Face and content validation are judgements of whether or not the instrument is reasonable (265) . Both are determined by experts and are rarely supported by empirical data. Face validation is the first judgement made about a scale and describes whether on the 'face' of it the in strument measures what is intended. Content validation extends this to include an assessment of whether the instrument captures all domains of the construct. Furthermore, judgements of the relevancy of included items are made to ensure that items that do n ot measure the construct of interest are removed. This means that a scale designed to measure pain based on observed behaviours should include all behaviours that can be used to discriminate the individual experiencing pa in from one who is not and to estab lish the intensity of the pain. Construct validation will also ensure that the scale does not include items that measure experiences other than pain, for example fatigue. The content of the instrument is determined by the instrument developer based on othe r instruments, the literature and the views of experts. Although content validation does not often involve statistical tests, it can be seen to be inversely related to internal consistency (267) . Therefore, decisions design ed to improve the internal consistency of the items on an instrument may result in the removal of items with low correlation to other instrument items. Paradoxically, this may reduce the scope of the construct as sessed by the instrument. Criterion validat ion Criterion validation is used when there is at least one other existing measure of the phenomenon of interest to which the performance of the experimental instrument can be compared (265) . Criterion validation methods include concurrent validation where the experimental instrument and the 'gold' standard are applied at the same time and p redictive validation where the 'gold' standard is applied later and the capacity of the results of the new instrument to predict a later outcome is determined (265) . In both cases to accept the instrument as valid relies on a strong correlation between the scores from the test of interest with those derived from application of the 'gold' sta ndard. The assumption behind criterion validation is that the existing measure is the 'gold' standard and therefore provides scores that most closely replicate a 'true' measure of the construct (265) . There SECTION 1 46 are several flaws in the logic that underpin this approach to validation. The premise for developing a new instrument is often the dev elopment of a new, more practical, safer or less expensive alternative to the existing instrument or an instrument that provides a timelier result than the criterion. However, on some occasions a new instrument i s developed as a more accurate alternative t o the existing instrument. In this circumstance it is counterintuitive to measure the performance of the new and improved instrument against the existing potentially less accurate one. This creates confusion when interpreting the correlation coefficients. (265) Another challenge to the logic and interpretation of criterion validation is that for many instruments used in health care there is not always an objective criterion available and the developers of the Consensus -based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN ) Checklist were in agreement th at no gold standards exist for patient reported health measures (271) . In these circumstances the new or experimental instrument is compared with the performance of an existing instrument that is also not a direct measure of the construct of interest. This requires that the existing tool is supported by validation data. This becomes an endless cascade of validation studies as each instrument requires validation against another criterion which is likely another indirect measur e of the construct (272) . With out complete confidence in the accuracy of the existing instrument it is impossible to interpret the performance of the experimental instrument based on the performance of the existing one. For example, if the scores are highly correlated it can be conclud ed that the instruments are measuring the same thing but not necessarily what they are measuring . Conversely if they are poorly correlated it can be concluded that the scales are not measuring the same thing. However, i n this situation it cannot be conclud ed that the original instrument is accurate and that the experimental instrument is not valid. Messick has offered more descriptive terms to better describe the rationale for the development of a new tool and therefore the val idation methods; diagnostic utility and predictive utility (273) . Diagnostic utility describes the methods of validation used to confirm that the new, less expensive, safer or more practical, ins trument performs at least as well as the existing criterion. The new instrument and the existing criterion would be applied at the same time and the outcomes compared. The FLACC scale was developed as a more practical (easily remembered) scale than existin g pain scales and could be validated in this way (28). Diagnostic utility would see the performance of this scale assessed against an existing scale that was con sidered the criterion or the 'gold' standard. Predictive ut ility defines the capacity of an instrument to predict an outcome that has as yet not occurred. There does not seem an obvious role for prediction in pain assessment. Hence, predictive validation m ethods are unlikely to be useful for validation of pain assessment scales . SECTION 1 47 Finally, criterion contamination exists when the outcome of the criterion ('gold' standard) is predicated on the results based on the new instrument (265) . This may be the case where the criterion instrument includes data from the new instrument; for example; patien t's report of pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) is t he criterion and is applied after the patient report of their pain using a simpler four -point verbal rating scale. The score given using the VAS is informed by the score allocated using the new ins trument and so high levels of correlation between the score s could be reasonably expected. There are scenarios where the results of the criterion are likely to be predicted by the new instrument and that this is acceptable, for example; where the new instrument is a modification e.g. a shorter version of an existi ng instrument or one that uses similar items to the criterion but is more easily remembered. In these situations, providing the application of the scales does not bias the outcomes, high correlatio n is both predictable and desirable (265) . Construct validation Construct validation i ncludes methods to indirectly establish validation of a new instrument where there are no existing instruments or criteria available to measure the construct (265) , for example the first observational pain scale developed to assess pain in children too young to self -report. Additionally, construct validation is used where a new instrument ha s been developed as the existing instruments were considere d a poor measure of the construct and therefore should not be used in criterion validation studies. Construct validation involves testing predictions about the construct that would confirm the capa city of the instrument to measure it accurately (265) . Construct validation relies on a n understanding of the construct and its relationship with other constructs , which can be used to generate these predictions or hypothes es (265, 267) . Construct validation could be said to provide circumstantial ev idence of validity and therefo re a single study supporting a hypothesis will not be sufficient to assert validity. Evidence must be built from multiple tests of a range of hypotheses. Interestingly, it has been said that it only takes negative results from one well -designed study to qu estion the entire construct (274) . Furthermore, it is unclear where the problem lies : with the experimental instrumen t, the hypothesis or with both. Commonly used methods which are examples of construct validation include extreme groups and convergent and discriminant validation (267) . 'Extreme gro ups' tests the performance of the instrument used to measure the cons truct in two groups; one group known to have the trait and the other which does not (265, 271) . It is expected that the instrument scores would acc urately distinguish between these two groups. This may also be described as discriminative validation. The key problem with this method is the identification of these two groups, particul arly where the instrument has been developed in the absence of an SECTION 1 48 appropriate method for measurement of the construct as is the case for pain experienced by infants and children unable to self -report. This method is also blunt in as much as it demonstrates the capacity of the instrument to measure the extremes but does not test the capacity to recognise more equivocal conditions, e.g. mild to moderate pain rather than no pain versus severe pain (265) . Comparing the performance of a new instrument against the performance of other instruments measuring t he same construct of measures or similar related variables is defined as convergent validation and is another construct validation method (265) . Studies aiming to demonstrate the validity of a pai n scale frequently correlate the scores from the experimental scale with scores from another pain scale. Less commonly, correlations between pain scores from the experimental scales are c orrelated with other variables based on an assumption that they are r elated in some way e.g. pain and fear. The corollary to convergence is discriminant validation. Not only should the instrument scores correlate strongly with scores using another instrume nt measuring the same construct but there should be no correlation wi th scores for dissimilar and unrelated constructs, e.g. pain and breathlessness. Once again, unpredictable results may reflect a flaw in the scale, the hypothesis or both (265) . Over the last 30 years there has been a trend to consider all validation methods construct vali dation (269) . The premise for this is that criterion validation is based on the hypothesis that there will be a positive correlation between the scores generated with a new instrument and the criterion (273) . Content validation is also based on the hypothesis that all items are measuring a facet of the same construct and that a significant feature of the construct is not overlooked. Therefore, content validation is considered by many as another type of construct validation (265) . Respo nsiveness and sensitivity to change are methods for validation that have been increasingly used to explore validity. These terms are often used interchangeably by authors; however Liang makes a distinction be tween them which is based on the relevance of th e resul t. Sensitivity to change is the ability of the instrument to detect significant change even if it is not meaningful while responsiveness is the ability of the instrument to measure meaningful change (275) . This is well illustrated using pain scale scores whe re sensitivity to change is shown if there is a statistical difference between pain scores, however the difference is clinically meaningless e.g. a difference of 0.5 between scores that is reported as statistically significant. Responsiveness is shown if t here is a statistically significant difference between scores that is also clinically significant e.g. a difference of 2 between pain scores (clinical significance for many scales is acknowledge d as '2' (276) ). Both approaches to validation are also a construct validation m ethod based on a hypothesis SECTION 1 49 that scores will cha nge over time or in response to treatment (e.g. analgesic) or a stimulus (e.g. painful). Practically, the language used to define validation is less important than the need to use a range of validation method s to demonstrate the validity of the scores and to repeat this testing under similar and different circumstances. Repeated demonstration of the validity of the scores provides a platform for extrapolating from these scores to the potential for scores assoc iated with the next application of the scale und er these circumstances to be valid. Feasibility and clinical utility Clinical utility describes the extent to which the results influence clinical decision -making and clinical outcomes (277) . It is now considered insufficient to introduce an instrument to clinical practice based solely on validation data. It must also be shown that the instrument produces clinically useful results. This concept has entered the diagnostic accuracy lit erature, but evaluation of this property has been variable. A common approach has been to assess how useful clinicians consider the information provided by the instrument and whether it is likely to influence their treatment choices. This has been criticis ed as too subjective and not necessarily a reflection of clinician behaviour as there is evidence that clinicians reported intentions do not always align with their practice. Ideally, assessment of the clinic al utility of a measure will include methods to determine the extent to which use of the measure results in changes in clinical decisions and more importantly improved clinical outcomes (277) . Instruments used for clinical or res earch purposed must accurately measure the construct in question. However, they must also be feasible for the circumstances. Instruments that are overly complicated, rely on extensive training or specialised equipment to use them, take too long to apply or are expensive are unlikely to gain favour regardless of how well they perform. The threshold for what is consider feasible will differ depending on whether they are proposed for research or clinical use (277) . The assessment of feasibility may also involve methods designed to measure the ease of application, efficiency and cost analysis. Conclusion Pain has attracted a great deal of int erest over many decades and recent advances in t echnology correspond with exponential growth in our understanding of the complex neurophysiology and the associated experience of pain. It is well beyond the scope of this chapter and this thesis to SECTION 1 50 explore t he evidence that details current understanding. This chapter provides a simple summary of these concepts to help place the research reported in this thesis in context. SECTION 2 51 Section 2 reports the first phase of this project which was a detailed interroga tion of the literature to identify behavioural pain scales that are potentially suitable to assess procedural pain in infants and young children . This work is reported in one chapter (Chapter 3). SECTION 2 52 3 CHAP TER 3 The aim of this phase of the p roject, the approach to the search, the search results, the criteria used to define 'potentially suitable' pain scales and the scales identified in the literature that met these predefined criteria , are reported in thi s chapter. It concludes with a descrip tion of the eligible scales and current understanding of their role in assessment of procedural pain in infants and young children. Background and aims During their healthcare, infants and children are often exposed t o painful and uncomfortable procedures . It is increasingly recognised that unrelieved or poorly managed pain can have significant sequelae (including long -term sequelae) , especially for preterm infants and children. A growing body of evidence demonstrates alterations in neural pathways (278, 279) , physical development (280) and pain -related behaviours (11, 281) as a result of neonatal exposure to pain (13). The impact of painful experiences during infancy and ch ildhood has not been as well studied but is likely to provo ke significant fear and anxiety associated with healthcare and future avoidance of healthcare (282, 283) . In light of this, procedural pain manag ement must be a priority for clinicians and researchers involved in treating infants and children and to identify efficacious pain management strategies for use in diverse settings where painful procedures take place. However, good management is contingent on recogn ition of pain and accurate assessment to guide treatment choices. Self-report of pain is generally accepted as the ideal way in which to assess pain, determine the need for strategies to relieve pain and assess the success of interventions (119, 284, 285) . However, the cognitive and language development of infants and young children prevents them from self -repor ting their pain experience. Clinicians and researchers rely on proxy measures to estimate the infant and young child's pain experience. Observational behavioural assessment scales are one of the most commonly used and most practical methods for pain assess ment. These scales are comprised of behaviours and in some cases physiological features considered indic ative of pain in infants and children. Over a decade ago, Duhn and colleagues reported the existence of over 40 published scales in the literature desig ned to assess pain in this age group (286) making it challenging for clinicians and researchers to select appropriately . SECTION 2 53 Systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines and experts in the field have provide d clues as to the best scales for ass essing pain in this age group (213) . However, consensus eludes us and there remains inconsistency across recommendations and in clinical and research application (30, 213) . The aim of this phase of the project wa s to identify observational behavioural scales that were designed for and considered suitable or used fo r assessment of procedural pain experienced by infants and young children unable to self -report pain that may be used for clinical or research purposes. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify observation al behavioural scales that could be considered potentially suitable to assess and quantify procedural pain intensity experienced by infants and young children. A search st rategy and the criteria used to define scales as potentially suitable were defined prior to conducting t his review of the literature. The results of the search were then reviewed against the se criteria to identify scales considered potentially suitable . Inclusion/exclusion criteria Scales were considered potentially suitable to quantify procedural pain inte nsity in infants and children if they met a series of criteria, which are described here and summarised in Table 3 -1. The criteria were carefully consid ered and agreed to by the authors with the aim of identifying a scale that c ould be used for clinical an d research purposes to assess procedural pain in infants and children unable to self -report. Several scale attributes formed the basis for considering a scale potentially suitable . The scale must assess pain using behavioural features of pain that can be identified by an observer without the need for extensive training or specialist equipment . Scales that included physiological parameters such as heart rate in addition to behavioural indices were not excluded providing these parameters could be collected at the same time to support immediate scoring of pain. Use of a 0 to 10 scale to quantify pa in intensity has gained increasing favour as the accepted metric to support consistency and comparability in measurement and communication (287) . For this reason, only scales quantify ing pain intensity using a 0 to 10 metric were accepted as potentially suitable . In addition to pain scales, scales referred to as a measure of 'pain -related distress' or 'pain and distress' were included to reflect the diversity of language of ten use to describe scales with similar assessment purpose. SECTION 2 54 To narrow the focus, the criteria for scales considered potentially suitable were further defined as scales considered potentially a ppropriate for procedural use and scales considered to have bee n accepted for this purpose. The agreed principle underpinning the criteria defining potentially appropriate was that well -designed scales and those with data to supp ort reliability and validity when applied to assess procedural pain would be appropriate f or this purpose. Therefore, scales were identified as potentially appropriate if they were recommended in a systematic review for assessing procedural pain in infants and/or children or had undergone psychometric testing to evaluate its reliability and val idity when used for this purpose. Furthermore, it was assumed that scales purposefully designed for procedural pain assessment would be designed to capture the unique circumstances of a medical procedure and therefore should also be considered potentially appropriate . Table 3-1 Criteria for identifying scales potentially suitable for assessing procedural pain in infant s and young children. Scale inclusion criteria Scale exclusion criteria Scale attributes : - Scale quantifies 'pain', 'pain -related distress' or 'pain & distress' AND - Observational pain scale based on behavioural indices of pain AND - Scores intensity using a 0 to 10 metric Potentially appropriate: - Scales recommended by systematic review of the psychometrics of pain scales OR - Scales designed to assess procedural pain &/OR - Undergone psychometric testing for procedural pain assessment use Accepted: Used in a mini mum of 5 RCTs from unique research groups OR Recommended in an expert consensus statement or CPG Available in English Designed exclusively as a measure of distress (no reference to pain assessment) Designed &/or tested exclusively for neonates Designed & /or tested exclusively for cognitively impaired infants & children Desig ned &/or tested exclusively for adults Scale does not rely on assessment of observable behaviours or uses indices of pain that are not immediately measurable e.g. physiological parameter s such as: salivary cortisol Scores intensity using a metric other tha n 0 to 10. Scale &/or publications not available in English Abbreviations: CPG - clinical practice guideline, RCT - randomised controlled trial SECTION 2 55 The foundation for including accepte d scales was the view that acceptance is indirectly evidence of expert opinion acknowledging the likely fitness for purpose of the scale. Therefore, accepted scales were defined as those scales that were either recommended in published expert consensus statements or clinical practice guidelines or were used in at least five randomised controlled trials (RCT) published by unique research groups. Expert consensus statements and guidelines were defined as statements and guidelines published by or endorsed by s pecialty organisations, associations, societies and colleges. These groups were further defined as national and international professional bodies representing a medical and/or allied health professional membership with a pain, emergency care, anaesthetic , pain or paediatric focus. National and international organisations established with the explicit purpose of producing evidence -based consensus statements e.g. Joanna Briggs Institute, were also included as experts. Scales des igned solely as a measure of d istress which did not acknowledge a role in assessing pain were excluded. Scales that were designed and assessed for use in one language and culture cannot be assumed to be appropriate for use in another without adequate trans lation and testing. For this r eason, scales not available in English were also excluded. Additionally, scales exclusively designed for and tested to assess neonatal (term and preterm) pain or pain experienced by cognitively impaired children and/or childre n with altered conscious state s were excluded. Finally, scales where psychometric testing was based on application of the scale to adults and children and the data for analysis was pooled were also excluded. Search strategy Identification of scales that met the pre-defined criteria was achieved by a series of searches to target the specific criteria. Each search is described separately, and the search terms used for these searches are listed in Appendix A (Box 1 - 4). In addition , the reference lists of all relevant publications were reviewed to identify other potentially relevant publications and data sources. See Table 3 -2 for a summary of these search strategies. Search: Potentially appropriate scales Two searches were conducted to identify potentially appropriate scales; the firs t to identify systematic reviews of studies examining the psychometric properties of pain assessment scales used to assess procedural pain and the second to retrieve individual studies assessing the psychometric properties of scales used to assess procedur al pain. Both searches used search terms to identify publications focused on the population of interest e.g. 'infant' or 'child' and the topic of interest e.g. 'pain assessment ' or 'pain measurement'. The search to identify systematic reviews SECTION 2 56 limited the s earch by publication type e.g. 'systematic review' and the search to identify psychometric evaluation studies included additional search terms e.g. 'validation', 'validity', or 'reliability' etc. The electronic PsycINFO usi ng Ovid, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Controlled Trials and Cumulative Index Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) using Ebsco were searched . The search occurred in week 4 of June 2014. All searches were limited to publi cations in English. Search : Accepted scales Identification of accepted scales involved two search strategies : the first to identify RCTs using an observational behavioural sca le to assess procedural pain in infants and children and the second to locate expert consensus statements and clinical practice guideline recommending scales for this purpose. To retrieve as many relevant RCTs as possible the search was broadened compared to the earlier searches which focus ed on 'pain assessment/measurement ' and inst ead the terms 'pain' and 'pain management' were used. However, to restrict the results to trials focussing on procedural pain a range of terms such as; 'procedure', 'blood samp ling', 'immunisation ' and 'wound care ' were added to the search strategy. Finall y, the search was also limited by publication type to 'clinical trial' OR 'RCT'. A search to identify expert consensus statements and clinical practice guidelines also used te rms to define the population of interest; 'infant' OR 'child' and the topic of i nterest which was once again kept broad; e.g. 'pain'. To restrict the results to expert consensus statements and clinical practice guidelines, terms such as; 'consensus' OR 'gu and PsycINFO us ing the Ovid platform, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Controlled Trials and CINAHL using the Ebsco platform were searched separately in the same week as the search for potentially appropriate scales (week 4, June 2014) to retrieve relevant publications. Additionally, a search of the web using the Google search engine to identify the websites of specialty organisations, associations, societies and colleges was completed using combinations of SECTION 2 57 the following terms; 'organisation' OR 'college' 'nursing' 'psychology'.

The behavioural observation scales that me t the criteria for potentially appropriat e and accepted were reviewed in detail to confirm that the scale attributes also met the inclusion criteria, e.g. observer applied scales based on behavioural indices considered indicative of pain and designed to qu antify pain intensity using a 0 to 10 met ric. Scales that were designed and tested exclusively to assess pain in neonates or cognitively impaired children , to exclusively assess distress or were not available in English were excluded. Results The followi ng sections report the results of ea ch se arch (Table 3 -3) and the review of the reported scales against the eligibility criteria. In summary, 36 scales were identified from a total of 2669 citations retrieved from the database searches and the web search. Several scales were identified in more th an one search strategy. Only two of the identified scales were originally designed to assess procedural in infants and young children; the MBPS (288) and the EVENDOL (289) . Following review of these scales and sup porting literature, three eligible scales were identified for inclusion; the Face, Legs Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale, the Modified Behavioural Pain Scale (MBPS) and the Visual Analogue Scale applied by an observer (VASobs).

The FLACC scale was recommended in both systematic re views, while the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) was only recommended in von Baeyer's systematic review (30). A review by van Dijk and colleagues (290) was excluded as although a review of av ailable evidence to summarise the reliability and validity of the VAS obs, it was not reported as a systematic or integrative review and did not meet the methodological criteria for eligibility. SECTION 2 60 Psychometric evaluation A total of 18 papers were identified that addressed psychometric evaluation of 13 observational behavioural scales used to assess procedural pain experienced by infants and/or children. These scales and the studies are listed in Table 3-4. The psychometric properties of the Children's and I nfant's Postoperative Pain Scale (ChIPPS) used to assess procedural pain was examined in a cross validation to test the scales performance following translation into Brazilian Portuguese. There are no stud ies available testing the scale's psychometric prop erties when used to assess procedural pain using the English version of this scale. For this reason, this scale did not meet the criteria for potentially appropriate and was excluded from further review. S imilarly, the EVENDOL was developed by a French tea m and to date psychometric analysis of the scale has only been completed for the French version of this scale hence, EVENDOL was also excluded from further review. Accepted scales RCT Thirty -two scales ( Table 3 -5) were identified in 171 RCTs where at lea st one observational behavioural pain scale was used to assess procedural pain in infants and children. Twenty -two studies reported use of more than one scale. Four scales; FLACC, MBPS, VASobs and CHEOPS, account for those used in over three quarters of th e trials assessed (n = 133, 77%). The VASobs was the most frequently used of all scales and appeared in 66 trials, while MBPS and FLACC were used in similar numbers of studies (n = 26 and n = 23, respectiv ely). More than a third of the scales (n = 14, 43%) were only used once and the remaining scales (n = 15, 45%) on fewer than five occasions each. Therefore, for this reason these scales were not considered as accepted for procedural pain assessment and were excluded from further review.

In addition, several databases and repositories that maintain lists of ev idence -based guidelines were also searched to identify relevant pu blications (Listed in Appendix A , Box 5 ). Recommendations for suitable observationa l scales for procedural pain assessment were available from, or endorsed by, eight professional groups via clinical guidelines an d consensus statements (Table 3 -6). Two organisations endorsed a third -party statement (the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) stat ement) rather than authoring their own. This resulted in six unique guidelines and consensus statement in which scale recommendations could be found. Statements and guidelines which had not been found via the web search of association, society, academy, co llaboration, organisation and network sites were not located as a result of searching databases such as Med line etc . The FLACC scale was recommended in six documents (15, 32, 285, 324 -326), the CHEOPS in three (15, 32, 285) and in addition to these scales, the COMFORT and the University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital ( UWCH ) pain scale were also recommended in the Royal College of Nursing Guideline (32). The Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessme nt in Clinical Trials (Pe dIMMPACT) Consensus Statement endorsed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) recommendation i s specific for assessment scales used in clinical trials and the FLACC scale and CHEOPS were both recommended for procedural use in this statement (285) .

The FLACC scale wa s recommended for use in two systemat ic reviews of the psychometric properties of pain assessment scales, has been evaluated in four psyc hometric evaluations s tudies and used in 23 RCTs and has been recommended in four expert consensus statements. The MBPS has also been evaluated in three psy chometric evaluation studies and has been used in 26 RCTs while the VASobs has been used in 66 RCTs and the scale's psychometric performance has been assessed in five studies. The MPBS and the VASobs have not been recommended in a systematic review of pain scale psychometrics or in a consensus guideline providing recommendations for assessment. Ineligi ble scales were excluded for either reasons related to the attributes of the scale; most commonly that they use an ordinal rating scale or do not quantify pain using a 0 to 10 metric or a lack of evidence to suggest that the scale is potentially appropriat e for procedural pain assessment in infants and children e.g. no psychometric data to support the scale . Additionally, scales were excluded if there was no/insufficient evidence that the scale has been accepted for this purpose, SECTION 2 67 i.e. used in too few RCTs or they were not recommended in a consensus statement or CPG.

Only three scales met our criteria : the FLACC scale, MBPS and VASobs. The remaini ng scales were excluded : many as the attributes of the scale rendered them unsuitable while others were excluded as there were no studies available that reported psychometric data, or they were not accepted as suitable by experts and researchers. Only on e of the three eligible scales, the MBPS, was designed specifically to assess procedural pain (288) . Two of the eligible scales, the FLACC scale and MBPS, were comprised of spec ific items considered indices of pain. Each item is scored based on demonstration of behaviours described for that score level. In contras t, the third scale, the VAS applied by the observer, is a single item scale and quantifies pain intensity based on the observer's overall impression, which may be based on a composite of the behaviours or a single behaviour that the observer considers indicative of pain. Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale The FLACC scale was designed to assess postoperative pain in infants aged two months to children aged seven years (28). It is comprised of five behavioural items; 'face', 'legs', 'activity ', 'cry' and 'consolability each scored on a scale from 0 to 2 to provide a total score from 0 to 10. This scale has been used extensively and was the most widely recommended of all the scales identified in this review. Two systematic reviews recommended the FLACC scale for procedural pain (30, 31) . Von Baeyer and Spag rud were commissioned by the Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Meas urement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (PedIMMPACT) to complete a review of studies evaluating the psychometr ic performance of pain scales used to assess pain in children aged three to 18 years (30). This review was published in 2007 and the authors concluded that the FLACC scale and the CHEOPS had been both extensively used and were supported by sufficient evidence of reliability, validity and responsiveness to recommend both scales for use . In their conclusions they pointed out one of the relative advantages of the FLACC scale; a scoring system based on a standard 0 to 10-metric. A second review published the same year repeated this recommendation but with more SECTION 2 76 reserve . It stated that in the absence of a more su itable scale , one supported by more substantial evidence of the scales ' psychometric properties, these scales may be cautiously recommende d as the most suitable for procedural pain assessment (31). Methods to evaluate the quality of the studies were not included limiting our capacity to weigh the strength of the data supporting the recommendations made in both reviews. The FLACC scale was also recommended for procedural pain assessment use in four expert consensus statements (15, 32, 285, 324) . The RCN (UK) commissioned an evidence -based review of their existing guideline to provide recommend ations regarding the recognition and a ssessment of acute pain in children (32). In addition, the European Socie ty for Pediatric Anaesthesiology and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health endorse d this document for use by t heir membership. This document was not described as a systematic review. However, the methods fo r the search and analysis of the studi es identified also approximate those described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review (PRISMA) Statement. The RCN went one step further than the two systematic reviews described and provide d narrative a ssessment of the methodological 'short comings' of included studies. However, details of the analysis of the data and therefore the basis for their conclusions were limited making it difficult to confirm the strength of their assertions. One of th e most robust of the expert statements, which although also not cited as a systematic review, approximate d the rigor associated with the methods described by the (PRISMA) Statement (329) . The 4th edition of Acute Pain Management: Scientific Evidence authored by a working group of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists and Faculty of Pain Medicine made recent recommendations to support use of the FLACC scale for procedural pain assessment (15). The CHEOPS, which we excluded on the basis that it does not use a 0 to 10 metric to score pain intensity, wa s also reco mmended in this synthesis of the scientific evidence. The Acute Pain Management: Scientific Evidence is a widely respected and accepted summary of available evidence and the authors note that the 3rd edition was endorsed by the International Association fo r the Study of Pain (IASP) and by Colleges, Societies and Associations from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia and recommended by the American Academy of Pain Medicine (15). The specific recommendations for procedural pain assessment reference data summarised in McGrath and colleagues' consensus statement (285) and von B aeyer's systematic review (30) and make no further attempt to describe the psychometric data supportin g their recommendation for the FLACC or CHEOPS scale. The Pediatric I nitiative on Methods Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (PedIMMPACT) Statement, commissioned and endorsed by the IASP is the only clear guidance SECTION 2 77 available for selection of appropriate scales to assess procedural pain in clinical trials. This statement refers us to the recommendations of the 2007 systematic review completed by von Baeyer and Spag rud. However, as has been pointed out this review was limited by the absence o f a critical review of the quality of the psychometric studies included in this study (330) . Furthermore, these reviews are now ten years old and our search for psychometric evaluation studies found four studies published since publication of this review. For this reason, a contemporary systematic review of the evidence addressing the performan ce of the FLACC scale to assess procedural pain which includes methods to review the quality of included studies is warranted Modified Behavioural Pain Scale (MBPS) The MBPS first app eared in the literature in 1995 is comprised of three behaviours; face, cry and movement and each is scored on a subscale based on the demonstration of described behaviours which are added to provide a final score out of ten (288) . Our search of the literature identified three psychometric evaluation studies addressing the performance of the MBPS used to assess procedural pain and 26 RCTs using the scale to meas ure procedural pain in infants and children and therefo re meets our criteria for scales potentially suitable to assess procedural pain in infants and children. The scale was uniquely designed to assess procedural pain in young infants and was initially to assess immunisation related pain (288) . However, it has escaped the attention of both systematic reviews published in 2007 and all published consensus statements. The focus of most of th e work since the original testing has been li mited to immunisation related pain , which may explain why this scale has not attracted the level of attention that a scale designed for procedural pain might. To better understand the psychometric perf ormance of the MBPS a systematic review should be compl eted to identify, assess and summarise the psychometric studies evaluating the performance of this scale, specifically for procedural pain assessment . This will serve as a platform for recommendations regarding MBPS clinical and research use . Visual Analo gue Scale observer The VAS applied by an observer met our criteria for scales considered potentially suitable . Five psychometric evaluation studies to establish the measurement properties of the VASobs or to compare performance with another scale were iden tified by our search. Furthermore, the VASobs was the most frequently used scale to measure proce dural pain in the RCTs located for this review. SECTION 2 78 A total of 64 RCTs used the scale to assess procedural p ain and it is likely that this reflects the practical a dvantages of the VASobs which is quick and simple to apply. Observers are asked to make a mark on an unmarked 10cm line between the anchors at each end 'no pain' and the 'worst pain' to indicate their impression of the infant or child's pain. Unlike many o ther scales the observers require little if any training and can apply the scale and record a score within seconds. These practical advantages may also encourage its use in clinical practice where pain assessment is needed, although it is not clear whether this is the case and to what extent it is used in clinical practice. The VASobs was not recommended in either systematic reviews or expert consensus statements or clinical practice guidelines which belies its extensive use in RCTs to measure procedural pain. It is likely that the VASobs has been overlooked in these reviews for similar reasons to those presented by van Dijk and colleagues in their 2002 review of available data addressing the reliabili ty and validity of the VAS used as an observational pai n scale (290) . The authors conclude d that the results support ing the psychometric properties of the VASobs were limited and that further testing wa s required before the scale c ould be accepted as suitable for assessing paediatric pain. Only one study cited in this review examined the scale's performance used to assess procedural pain (331) . The authors call ed for further testing in circumstances where the child is unable to self -report, using study designs able to test the scales sensitivity to pain. Considering the favour shown to the VAS obs and the concerns of van Dijk in 2002, it is critical that clinicians and researchers are provided with a clear understanding of the evidence supporting this choice of scale for clinical and research purposes. Limitations There are several limitations to this review that increase the likelih ood that scales that may be reliable and valid when used to assess procedural pain in infants and children were not identified in this review. The criteria used to select eligible scales were carefully considered and were based on an assumption that scales that were designed for procedu ral pain assessment, ha d unde rgone psychometric testing and were accepted as appropriate for procedural pain are likely to be suitable for procedural pain assessment. Criteria also limited scales to ones using a 0 to 10 metri c as it is widely accepted that use of a standard metric will improve interpretation of scores and treatment decision s. However, as all scales can be converted mathematically to a 0 to 10 metric, it could be argued that this was an unnecessary restriction. Particularly , as it is conceiv able that scales that may be potentially reliable and valid for procedural pain assessment may have been excluded by these criteria. Scales were also limited to those available and tested in English. As has been said, SECTION 2 79 scales assessed as valid in one langua ge cannot be assumed to be valid in another. However, exclusion based on language may also have resulted in the exclusion of a potentially suitable scale. The design of the search was aimed at identifying all relevant publica tions. However, as this review did not apply the methodological rigour of a systematic review it is possible that the search did not identify all studies and therefore scales that may have met inclusion criteria. Recommendations and future directions This review aimed to identify pain scales that we may consider potentially suitable . However, it has not identified scales that can be conclusively considered valid for use to assess procedural pain in infants or children for clinical or research purposes. Th e three scales identified show promise as viable options for this purpose. To draw firm conclusions about each of these scales and make recommendations regarding their use, the psychometric (reliability and validity) and practical (feasibility) properties and clinical utility of each sh ould be carefully assessed in systematic reviews of all available psychometric data. The review design should employ search strategies which minimise the likelihood that eligible data is overlooked, is based on the principles of the PRISMA statement and in cludes methods to assess the quality of the included studies. This is the focus of the next phase of this project. SECTION 2 80 Addendum: New literature The searches for this phase were completed in June 2014 and included studies and g uidelines published before this date. We recently repeated these searches to identify relevant literature published more recently that might alter the conclusions drawn from this search. This search was conducted in the first week of May 2018 and includes studies and guidelines published between June 2014 and May 2018. We used the search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria used in our original review to identify scales that might now meet our criteria for scales considered potentially suitable for pr ocedural pain assessment use. The recent search did not identify new scales designed for procedural pain assessment or more recent systematic reviews summarising the psychom etric properties of existing scales, other than those that arose from the next pha se of this project (330, 332) . Only two studies were completed to evaluate the psychometric properties of a scale used to assess procedural pain in infants or children, the focus of both was the FLACC scale (333, 334) . Furthermore, there were no new consensus statements or changes to existing recommendations from professional associations, academies, societies or organisations regarding the most suitable observational scale for procedural pain assessment use. Fifty -seven RCTs that measured procedural pain using an observation pain scale were identified and 24 (40%) of them used the FLACC scale, seven used the MBPS and six used the VASobs to measure a study outcome. The Neona tal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used in eight trials. However, the NIPS is scored on a scale of 0 to 7 and was therefore excluded. The re maining RCTs used nine different scales, some of which were not identified in the original search , such as, the Analge sia Nociceptive Index (ANI) and the Sound, Eye and Motor (SEM) scale. The Faces Pain Scale -Revised applied by an observer (FPS -Robs) was u sed in one RCT since t he original search, taking the total number of RCTs to five. Implications These results do no t alter our assessment of the eligibility of the FLACC scale, the MBPS or the VASobs. However, notably there was a reduction in the freque ncy of the use of the VA Sobs in RCTs compared with the FLACC scale. The Faces Pain Scale -Revised applied by an observe r (FPS -Robs) would now meet the pre -defined criteria to be considered potentially suitable to assess procedural pain in infants and childr en. This section includes four chapters: the first of which report s the methods used and the following three chapters report the results of three systematic reviews conducted to summarise the existing evidence addressing the psychometric properties of the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale, the Modified Behavioural Pain Scale (MBPS) and th e Visual Analogue Scale applied by an observer (VASobs). Chapters 6 and 7 are presented as published versions of the FLACC scale and MBPS reviews. SECTION 3 82 4 CHAPTER 4 This chapter reports the methods used for the three systematic reviews conducted to summaris e the evidence addressing the psychometric properties of the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale, the Modified Behavioural Pain Scale (MBPS) and the Visual Analogue Scale applied by an observer (VASobs). T hese scales were selected from the many (over 40 scales) that appear in the literature (212, 286) as they met the criteria developed to identify scales that may be potentially suitable for procedural pain assessment. Methods Systematic review s were conducted to identify and appraise the evidence for the psychometric properties, the clinical utility and the feasibility for use of the FLACC, MBPS and VASobs . A protocol, which was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses (PRISMA statement) (329) was developed by me with the support of my supervisors for this purpose. The protocol was registered separa tely for each review with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (FLACC: CRD42014014296, MBPS: CRD42016041722 and VASobs: CRD42016041724) . They are full text on the PROSPERO Web Site (335-337). Inclusion/exclusion criteria Studies reporting reliability, validity, clinical utility or feasibility data for the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs applied to infants and children were included in these reviews. This included studies w here the aim of the study was to examine the psychometrics of the scale, compare the scale with alternative scales or assessment tools or establish the psychometrics of an alternative scale or assessment tool using one of these scales as a reference. The r eview also included RCTs using the FLACC scale, MBPS or VASobs as an outcome measure as trial methods are a method for construct validation (i.e.: the capacity of the scale to detect a difference between known or extreme groups). Infants and children were defined as participants aged from birth to 18 years. Studies that did not report or analyse FLACC, MBPS or VASobs scores separately, did not include infants or children or report their data separately, were only published as an abstract or SECTION 3 83 were not availa ble in English were excluded from this review. Finally, studies using or evaluating a modified version of any of these scales (including translated versions) were also excluded. Following quality assessment, RCTs with Jadad s cores ( described in section 4.1 .5) less than three were excluded as they were considered at risk of significant bias and therefore unlikely to contribute significant evidence to this review (338) . Search strategy Relevant search terms were used to search the following databases : MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO using the Ovid, PubMed and EBSCOhost platforms. Goo gle Scholar was also searched using the same se arch terms and the reference lists of the included studies and identified reviews were also searched. The search was limited to texts av ailable in English. The terms used and the date ranges used for searches are reported in Table 4 -1. Table 4-1 Search terms and search dates used for the FLACC scale, MBS and VASobs systematic reviews.

SECTION 3 84 Study selection Following removal of duplicates, abstracts were reviewed by two independent reviewers (DC and one of NS, FB, or DH). Where eligibility was ambiguous the full te xt article was reviewed. A third reviewer was used to reach consensus where study eligibility remained unclear. Data extraction Data extraction was completed by one reviewer (DC) and recorded on one of two extraction tools: for the psychometric evaluation studies, a modification of the QAREL data extraction form (339) designed for appraisals of diagnostic reliability studies was used and for the RCTs, a modification of the Cochrane Collaboration data collection tool designed for intervention studies (340) was used. The modifications of these forms included the deletion of irrelevant fields and the addition of fields to capture relevant methods and results not included in the original form. The data extrac ted included; par ticipant details (e.g. numbers, demographics), setting and circumstances of the pain being measured ( e.g. associated with disease, operative or procedural), scale description (e.g. items and modifications), study methods (design, psychomet ric properties evaluated, and statistical methods), sources of bias and study results. Data was extracted by one reviewer (DC) and checked and confirmed by a second reviewer (FB, DH or NS). A third reviewer completed data extraction independently to resol ve any inconsiste ncies between the first two reviewers. Quality assessment One of two quality assessment tools were applied independently by two reviewers (DC and one of NS, FB, or DH) and a third where agreement was not achieved by the first two reviewe rs. The methodolo gical quality of the psychometric evaluation studies was appraised using the COSMIN checklist (341) and the RCTs were appraised using the Jadad score (338) . The COSMIN checklist was also used to assess the methods of an RCT where other psychometr ic properties, such as reliab ility and responsiveness, were assessed in the trial. The COSMIN checklist was developed to assess the quality of studies focused on health related patient -reported outcome measures and provides standards for study design, st atistical methods and acceptable outcome values (342) . The checklist is also conside red suitable for clinical rating SECTION 3 85 scales that measure constructs not self -reported but not directly measurable and has been previously used in a systematic review examining the psychometric properties of an observer applied fatigue assessment scale for chil dren (343) . The checklist is comprised of four steps: 1. Identification of the meas urement properties (see Table 4 -3 for measurement properties), 2. Assessment of the item response theory methods applied, 3. Evaluation of the quality of the met hods used to assess the measurement properties identified in step one and 4. Assessment of the generalisability of the results. The measurement properties : internal consisten cy, reliability, measurement error, content validity, construct validity (structur al validity, hypothesis testing, cross -cultural validity), criterion validity and responsiveness are assessed against a series of criteria. Each criterion is scored on a 4 -point scale ('poor', 'fair', 'good' or 'excellent') depending on the standard met. T he lowest item rating forms the final assessment for the methods used to assess that property. A study may receive different assessments for the methods addressing different psychometric properties. The COSMIN taxonomy and the terms commonly used to descri be the methods in pain scale evaluations studies are defined in Table 4 -2. The che cklist is included in full in Appendix B and a full description of the COSMIN checklist and application of scoring system can be found on the COSMIN website (http://www.cosmi n.nl/the_cosmin_checklist.html). The Jadad Scale (Table 4 -3) for assessing the quality of RCTs focuses on randomisation, blinding and participant follow -up and has been used in a previous pain scale reviews to assess the quality of RCTs (220) . Each item contributes to a to tal score out of five, where five is a perfect score. High scoring studies will pr ovide higher levels of evidence of the scales capacity to distinguish between known groups than low scoring studies. For these reviews we made a minor modification to the def inition for participant follow -up and scored this as acceptable if, in the absence of an explicit statement 'there were no withdrawals from this study' , there was sufficient detail in the results to account for all study participants. The intention was to report t he feasibility and the clinical utility of scale application in clinical practice in these reviews. A tool to support the assessment of the quality of the methods used to evaluate the practicality or feasibility or the clinical utility of the scal e was not identified. For this reason, a pragmatic and descriptive approach to ass essing these studies was adopted. SECTION 3 86 Table 4-2 Pain scale validation strategies and COSMIN taxonomy (342) .

Was the study described as randomized (this includes the use of words such as randomly, random and randomisation 2. Was the study described as double blind? 3. Was there a description of withdrawal s and dropouts? Scoring the items: Either give a score of 1 point for each \"yes\" or 0 points for each \"no.\" Give 1 additional point each if: For question 1, the method to generate the sequence of randomization was described and it was appropriate (table of random numbers, computer generated, etc.) If for question 2 the method of double blinding was described, and it was appropriate (identical placebo, active placebo, dummy, etc.) Deduct 1 point each if: For question 1, the method to generate the sequence of randomization was described and it was inappropriate (patients allocated alternately, or according to date of birth, hospital number, etc .) For question 2, the study was described as double blind, but the method of blinding was inappropriate (e.g. comparison of tablet vs. injection with no double dummy) Data synthesis The results of the search and study selection were described using the PRISMA flow chart (329) . Studies using different designs were included in this review, therefore pooling of data for meta - analysis was not considered possible. A narrative synthesis of the evidence provided by each study was therefore used to addres s each of the study outcomes. It was also anticipated that eligible studies would apply the scale to different populations (e.g. age groups) and under different circumstances (e.g. postoperative, procedural and illness/injury related) to those for which th e scale was developed and orig inally tested. These studies were reviewed separately to the studies concentrating on the original population and circumstances and the results summarised for these cohorts (in most cases defined by age and the circumstances o f pain) . As it was not possibl e to identify a population for which the VASobs was originally designed, studies eligible for this review were grouped based on age ranges selected to reflect potential differences in behavioural responses to pain which may in turn influence the observer's impression of the pain experienced SECTION 3 88 by the infant or child and therefore their application of the VASobs. The ranges were: neonates, infants and toddlers aged 1 month to 3 years, young children aged 3 to 12 years and older chi ldren (over 12 years). Subgrou ps were also created based on the circumstances of the pain (procedural, postoperative, illness/injury related) as it is accepted that these circumstances may impact on the infant of child's experience and the behaviours demon strated e.g. procedures are li kely to be associated with significant fear related distress, the behaviours of which may mimic pain -related behaviours (263) . The weight of evidence derived from each study was estimated based on the strength of the results and the q uality of the methods used in the study. Comparison between groups of other pain related variables measured in the RCTs also contributed to this assessment. Where these results were consistent with the results of the between groups comparison of the FLACC, MBPS or VASobs scores they he lped to support the strength of the contribution of these results to our understanding of the validity of the scale. A narrative synthesis of the results from the studies included in this review was completed as the heteroge neity of the eligible studies meant that pooling of data for meta -analysis was not possible. The results were summarised for the various subgroups created based on age and circumstances. The evaluation criteria for IMMPACT reviews (344) (Table 4 -4) provided a frame work to define the strength of the evidence base supporting the psychometrics of a scale or measure based on the number, results and independence of the evaluation studies. Assessment of study quality is not included in the criteria which is a significant limitation to this framework. However, the principles used to underpin these assessment criteria are used here to guide our synthesis. SECTION 3 89 Table 4-4 IMMPACT evaluation criteria for the level of evidence sup porting the psychometrics properties of a scale.

SECTION 3 90 Addendum The systematic reviews conducted for this phase of the project were conducted between 201 4 and 2016. The searches and analysis of the results for each scale was repeated in May 2018 to identify data published since the origin al review, specifically data that may impact on the original conclusions drawn. The same search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify eli gible studies and these studies were reviewed to determine whether they were likely to alter the conclusions drawn based on the results of the original review. To make a broader contribution to our understanding of the psychometric properties of the scales the original reviews were not restricted to procedural pain assessment. However, the recent search es and review s were restricted to studies (psychometric evaluation studies and RCTs) that focused on the scale used to assess procedural pain in infants and children. SECTION 3 91 5 CHAPTER 5 A systematic review of the psychometric properties of the observer a pplied Visual Analogue Scale (VASobs). The results of an unpublished systematic review to summarise the data that describes the psychometric properties of the Visual Analogue Scale applied by an observer (VASobs) to assess pain in infants and children are reported in this chapter. As this work is currently unpublished it is presented here formatted for the thesis. The chapter concludes with a summary of relevant data published since the original review and their impact on the assessment of the psychometric properties of the VASobs. Abstract Introduction: The visual analogu e scale has widely been used by observers to assess pain in infants and children unable to self -report pain (VASobs). However, there are concerns about the reliability and validity of th e scale when applied by observers. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a current summary of the psychometric properties of the VASobs. EMbase, Database of Systematic Re views and Cochrane Controlled Trials and Google Scholar. Studies exami ning the psychometric properties of the VASobs and RCTs using the VASobs as an outcome measure for participants aged from birth to 18 years were eligible for inclusion. Quality assessmen t of the included studies was completed using the COSMIN Checklist and the Jadad Scale. Results: Thirty -two psychometric evaluation studies and 65 RCTs were included . The study population, circumstances and the st udy quality varied greatly. There was promising but not conclusi ve data to support the psychometrics of the sca le for assessing immunisation related pain, less convincing data supporting the psychometrics for assessing other procedures and based on contradictory findings and limited data, very li mited evidence to support the psychometrics of the scale used to asses s postoperative pain. SECTION 3 92 Discussion: The conclusions drawn from this review are unchanged from those of a similar review published 15 years ago. The VASobs although widely used can not be unequivocally recommended for assessing the pain experienced by infant s and children. SECTION 3 93 Introduction Graphical tools, such as the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS ), were designed to quantify the extent of a range of subjective experiences where individu als had difficulty capturing the experience in words, specifically to articula te symptom intens ity precisely (345) . Use of the VAS to support self-assessment of pain intensity is supported by early work reporting the validity of the scale when used for this purpose (118, 345 -348). The ease with which it could be applied and the strength of the evidence supporting validity of self-reported VAS scores served as the platform for use of this scale applied by observer s to assess the intensity of pain experienced by individuals unable to use the scale to self-report, such as infants and young children (290) . The V AS is a line measuring 10 centimetres ( cm) with verbal anchors at each en d; most commonly 'no pain' and 'worst possible pain' which correspond to a sco re of '0' and '10' respectively (118, 345) . The line is otherwise unmarked and patients or a sui table observer are asked to place a mark on the line to indicate the pain they (or the patient) are currently experiencing. The distance from the zero mark is measure d and this is considered their pain score . In 2002, van Dijk and colleagues published a r eview of the evidence to establish the usefulness of the VAS applied by an observer for paediatric pain assessment (290). They drew our attention to significant gaps in the evidence supporting observer applied VAS in this population . The results for inter -rater reliability were most often reported as Pearson correlation coefficients which gave us no understanding of the level of agreement between scores and only the extent to which they correlate. It is therefore theoretically possible for scores to differ substa ntially but correlate strongly if the observer scores change in the same direction from one observation to the next, i.e. both observers scores increase (or decrease) from one observation to the next . Intra -rater reliability had at the time of their review not been tested. Validity testing was limited to demonstrating the extent to which scores correlated with sco res derived from application of an alternative pain scale or with self -reported scores and results were mixed . In summary, the authors concluded t hat there was insufficient evidence to support the reliability and validity of the VAS used by observers to quantify pain intensity in infants and children and that further psychometric testing was needed. In light of van Dijk and colleagues conclusions 15 years ago (290) and continued use of the VASobs to measure study outcomes , it is reasonable to undertake a curren t review to determine whether there is now sufficient high -quality data to support use of this scale to assess pain in infants and children. SECTION 3 94 Review aim The aim of this systematic review was to provide a current summar y of the psychometric and practical pr operties of t he VASobs to assess pain in infants and children . The specific objectives were to 1) identify and describe the paediatric populations and circumstances for which psychometric data is available, 2) systematically review the quality of this data , 3) analyse and summarise the strength of evidence that support the psychometric properties , clinical utility and feasibility of the VAS and provide recommendations to guide clinical and research use of this scale to assess pain in infants and children . Methods The methods for this study are described in the protocol which is provided in Chapter 4. Results The search for this review was completed in Aug 2016 and a total of 97 studies ( 32 psychometric evaluation studies and 65 RCTs) were eligible for this review. The results of the search and eligibility screening are shown in Figure 5 -1. SECTION 3 95 Figure 5-1 Flow chart detailing the search and study screening results Abbrev.

However, almost half (n = 13, 40.6%) used the VASobs as a reference scale in a study designed to ass ess the psychometric properties of another scale. These studies were eligible as they either included analysis of the performance of the VASobs other than correlation with a new scale or the index scale had undergone previous psychometric testing and was r eported as valid. The results from correlations between the index scale and the VAS obs for two eligible studies was excluded as the index scale was a newly developed scale which had not been tested and therefore could not be assumed to be valid (292, 349). The scale was applied by parents of infants and/or children (n = 22), nurses (n = 11), physicia ns (n = 5), researchers (n = 3) and other observers (n=3) for infants and children experiencing postoperative (n = 12), procedural (n = 11) and disease or injury related (n = 9) pain. The age of participants in these studies ranged from newborn to 18 years old. A more comprehensive summary of each study can be found in Appendix C , Table 1 . Randomised Controlled Trials Table 5-1 lists the 65 RCTs included in this review. The study populat ions ranged in age from newborn to 18 years old and included infants a nd children experiencing procedural (n = 50), postoperative (n = 11) and disease/injury related (n = 4) pain. The VASobs was applied most often by parents (n = 49), then nurses (n = 27), physicians (n = 9), investigators (n = 11) and finally by other obser vers (n = 6). These studies are summarised in more detail in Appendix C, Table 2 . SECTION 3 97 Table 5-1 Summary of the RCT s using VA Sobs to measure a study outcome.

SECTION 3 106 Psychometric properties and study quality The studies eligible for this review evaluated the fo llowing psychometric properties: intra-rater reliability (2 psychometric evaluation studies), inter -rater reliability (19 studies: 17 psychometric evaluation studies and 2 RCTs), criterion validity (17 psychometric evaluation st udies), responsiveness (10 studies: 6 psychometric evaluation studies and 4 RCTs) and hypothesis test ing (74 studies), specifically; convergent validity (15 psychometric evaluation studies and 1 RCT), discriminant validity (1 psychometric evaluation study) and between known groups (67 studies: 2 psychometric evaluation studies and 65 RCTs). Measurement er ror, content validity, structural validity and cross -cultural validity were not reported in any of the studies eligible for this review. The quality of th e methods used to evaluate the psychometric properties varied across studies and within studies : ranging from 'poor' to 'excellent', with only one study scoring 'excellent' for methods assessing criterion validity and one for inter -rater reliability (see T able 5-2). Almost two thirds (67.3%) of the methods used to assess the psychometrics of the VASobs sc ored either 'fair' or 'poor' and methods used to assess scale responsiveness were not scored above 'poor' in any of the studies in this review. The RCT met hods scored '3' (n = 35) and '5' (n = 23) using the Jadad Scale. SECTION 3 107 Table 5-2 COSMIN Checklist (quality) sco res for psychometric parameters (342) .

Specific factors impacting o n method quality included : poorly described methods for reliability, poor reporting of the hypot hesis, use of an inappropriate reference scale for criterion validity, observers applying both tools for convergence assessment and no blinding of observers to circumstance for responsiveness testing. Data synthesis The evidence from the psychometric eva luation studies and the RCTs were integrated to draw conclusions about the psychometric properties (reliability, validity, feasibility and clinical utility) of the VASobs and the results are grouped by psychometric property (e.g. reliability) and method of evaluation (e.g. responsiveness) and the circumstance of pain (e.g. postoperative) and summarised in Tables 5-3 to 5-6. Studies were also grouped and results s ummarised by age group s based on potential variability in behavioural responses to pain : neonate s (preterm and term ), older infants and children aged up to 3 years, children aged 3 to 12 years and over 12 years.

Harrison reported results separately for two age cohorts (12 to 18 months and 3 to 5 years) undergoing immunisation (440) and Chapman undertook sub analysis of the results for infants aged 0 to 2 years (356) . Reliability The two studies evaluating intra -rater reliability examine VASobs performanc e in circumstances and age groups that are broadly similar (infants undergoing immunisation and infants and children up to 4 years of age undergoing burns dressing). Both studies reported inconsistent reliability where kappa scores (0.69 - 0.91) (433) and intra -class correlations (ICC) (0.52 - 0.82) (331) vary considerably. Furthermore, the methods used wer e assessed as 'poor' and 'fair' respectively. Consequently, there is currently insufficient data of high en ough quality to draw conclusions about the intra -rater reliability of the VASobs used to assess procedural pain. Inter -rater reliability of the VASo bs was evaluated when used to assess procedural pain (n = 9), postoperative pain (n = 5) and disease or inj ury related pain (n = 7). The age range for studies focusing on procedural and postoperative pain was from birth to 16 years, while those focusing on disease/injury related pain included children up to 18 years. Procedural pain Two studies addressed proce dural pain assessmen t in ter m and pre -term neonates and it wa s possible to conclude that the VASobs show ed promise as a reliable tool to assess procedural pain in neonates based on convincing results from Liaw and colleagues' study (ICC range 0.8 to 0.89 and 'excellent' methods) (424) . The results of the second study were variable (r = 0.42 to 0.91), generated using methods assessed as 'poor' and although less convincing they imply p otential reliability (292). Similarly, only two studies used a sample of infants and toddlers aged from 1 month to three years and only one makes a contribution to the assessment of reliability. Taddio and colleagues reported ICC results ranging from 0.55 to 0.97 (433) . Considering the use of methods rated as 'poor' it is difficult to interpret these results. There is insuffic ient high -quality data to draw conclusions about the VASobs used to assess infants and toddlers experiencing procedural pain. A single high -quality study (COSMIN - 'good') reported good correlation between the VASobs scores of observers (r = 0.73) used to assess procedural pain in a cohort of children aged four to five (416). No other studies provided evid ence to support the reliability of the scale for young SECTION 3 110 children aged 3 to 12 years and none were found specifically addressing reliability in children older than 12 years. However, four studies use d samples where age groups included infa nts and children ac ross a ge range s between 0 to 16 years (331, 417, 418, 422) . Two psychometric evaluation studies from the same research group reported ICCs ranging from 0.56 to 0.64 using methods rated in both studies as 'fair' for cohorts aged 0 to 4 years and 0 to 5 years (331, 417) . These results contribute low levels of evidence to support an assertion that VASobs is reliable when used to assess procedural pain in young children. A study which recruited children aged 0 to 16 years was excluded as this study also used non -conventional analysis to demonstrate reliability (difference between scores using an independent t -test) and reported results that confirm ed a difference (422) . Finally, Eyelade and colleagues reported an ICC of 0.73 for VASobs scores for children aged 6 months to 12 years undergoing venepuncture using methods rated as 'fair' (418) . This study is also not sufficient to conclude that the VASobs is reliable when used to assess proc edural pain in older children, but it does suggest the potential for reliable scores in this age group. The sum of these results implies that the VASobs used to a ssess procedural pain in infants and young children is likely to result in scores with fair to good levels of reliability but is not conclusive in the absence of more high -quality evidence. Postoperative pain There are no studies addressing reliability of the VASobs in neonates or infants experiencing postoperative pain. Five studies recrui ted children aged between 0 and 16 years. Wilson and colleagues reported a correlation of 0.69 for children aged 2 to 11 years (439) and Knutsson and colleagues (441) correlations of 0.66 & 0.67 for children aged 3 to 10 years. Correlations between scores for children aged 3 to 15 years in Romsing and colleagues' study were slightly lower 0.52 to 0.60 but not conflicting (429) . All three studies used methods rated as 'good' and contribute evidence suggesting 'good' levels of reliability for VASobs scores in this age group (442) . In contrast, Miller and colleagues reported poor to fair correlations (r = 0.36 & 0.47) for children aged 7 to 11 years but used methods rated as 'fair' (427) . Suominen and colleagues used alternative analysis methods and reported Lin's c oncordance correlation (0.61) and bias was 3.1 mm and the 95% limits o f agreement were - 30.2 to 36.3 indicating considerable variation in scores for a cohort of children aged 0 to 16 years (349) . From these studies it is possible to conclude that the reliability of VASobs scores for children aged 2 to 16 years experiencing postoperative pain is likely to be fair to good. SECTION 3 111 Illness/injury related pain Three studies addressed the use of the VASobs t o assess pain associated with juvenile arthritis (JA) in children aged from three to 18 y ears. The methods were assessed as 'fair' and 'poor' and correlations ranged from 0.47 to 0.94. Widely variable results and lower quality methods make it impossible to draw conclusions about VASobs use in children with JA from these studies. The remaining four studies addressed acute illness/injury related pain. In two separate studies using methods rated as 'fair', De Jong and colleagues reported ICCs for children with burn related pain aged between 0 to 5 years which ranged from 0.52 to 0.59 (331, 417) . Using more robust methods (COSMIN = 'good'), Singer and collea gues reported weak correlations (r = 0.4) between the VASobs scores of observers in a cohort aged 4 to 7 years (430) . It should be noted that their study report ed pooled data and therefore reliability results include results for children a ssessed during a procedure (22% of the sample). Finally, Koller and colleagues reported results for a broader age range (6 to 18 years ). The ir methods we re rated as 'poor' and their results did not provide convincing evidence of VASobs reliability. The sum of the results of these studies is unclear and no conclusion about the capacity of the VASobs to generate reliable scores when used to assess acute illn ess/injury related pain in young or older children can be drawn in the absence of higher quality studie s.

Following clo ser assessment, the results of comparison of the VASobs between groups in 14 RCTs were not mirrored by the results for other variables in the study e.g. other measures of pain . Therefore, these studies did not provide evidence to support VASobs validity and are not reported in the tables. This left 44 studies, which are summarised in the following sections add ressing validation . Participants recruited for studies that provided validation data included neonates to 18 -year-old children experiencing a range of procedures the most common of which was immunisation (n = 18). Other needle related procedures e.g. intravenous ( IV) catheter insertion and intramuscular ( IM) injection, accounted for the procedure in another 22 studies. Four studies contributed evidence to support VASobs validation in a neonatal sample experiencing immunisation, heel prick and endotracheal suction related pain (386, 391, 424, 436) . The RCTs reported results that contributed low and very low level s of evidence that support ed the capacity of the VASobs to distinguish between known groups (386, 391) . Liaw and colleagues demonstrate d scale responsiveness (baseline 2.32, SD 1.94 vs procedure 7.59, SD 2.82; p < 0.001) but as the quality of the methods were rated as 'fair' their contribution to VASobs validation is weakened (424) . Although the quality of the methods used by Valitalo and colleagues were rated as 'good', wid ely varying correlations between VASobs score and other related constructs from 0.02 (physiological items) to 0.8 (pain model) make interpretation of their results and their contribution to VASobs validity in neonates d ifficult (436) . Liaw and colleagues also reported strong correlations between VASobs and PIPP scores (ICC 0.75 to 0.82) as evidence of excellent criterion validity (424) . However, as PIPP scores cannot be cons idered 'gold standard' the COSMIN rating was 'poor'. These results are more appropriately viewed as evidence of convergence , in which case they provide moderate levels of evidence to support VASobs validity. Finally, Kozer and colleagues conducted an RCT u sing the VASobs to measure the difference between groups of infants aged from birth to 2 months (376) . Although not limited to neonates, the age range was sufficiently narrow to consider that the evidence (low) provided by their stud y added t the weight of evidence addressing t he capacity of the scale to differentiate between known groups of neonates. Nonetheless, there was insufficient data to confidently conclude that the VASobs is valid when used to assess proced ural pain in neonat es but sufficient to consider it possible. SECTION 3 116 Nine studies recruited infants and toddlers aged between 1 month and 3 years or reported results for this age group separately (356, 371, 373 -375, 378, 383, 433, 440) and eight of these studies concentrated on immunisation related pain (371, 373 -375, 378, 383, 433, 440) . Ipp's research group are responsible for three of the seven RCTs which demonstrate the capac ity of the VASobs to differentiate between known groups, eac h contributing low levels of evidence for VASobs validity used to assess immunisation related pain (371, 373, 374) . Four independent RCTs also provided ve ry low (n = 2), low and moderate levels of evidence respectively , supporting the VASobs capacity to distinguish between known groups of infants and young children (356, 375, 378, 440) . In contrast, Taddio and colle agues' study designed to assess the validity of the VASobs used to assess immunisation related pain in infants aged 12 months old provided no evidence that the VASobs can differentiate between known groups (433) . Excellent correlations between VASobs and MBPS scores are reported as evidence of strong criterion validity. However, as the MBPS cannot be accepted as 'gold standard' this would also be better described as convergence validation and as such the quality of the methods could be considered 'good' with results providing strong evidence to support the validity of the scale. The sum of the results from these studies wa s sufficient to cautiously suggest that the VASobs is valid when used to assess immunisation rel ated pain in infa nts and toddlers. However, there wa s very limited data (356) addressing the scales performance used to assess alternative procedures in this age group. Eight studies reported relevant data for p opulations between 3 and 12 years (352, 359, 369, 384, 396, 416, 432, 440) . Five studies used a cohort undergoing immunisation (359, 369, 416, 432, 440) while the other thr ee concentrated on children undergoing venepuncture (n = 2) (352, 396) and burns care (384) . Five RCTs provided very low levels of evidence (352, 359, 369, 396, 440) and another moderate levels of evidence (384) that the VASobs can distinguish between known groups of childr en in this age range. Responsiveness was only tested in one study by C ohen and colleagues and scores were higher during immunisation than at baseline (ANOVA F (1, 49) =71.15, P<0.001 ) (359) . The methods used were rated as 'poor' and for this reason only contribute d very low levels of evidence. Correlations with self -reported pain scores for children undergoing immun isation (parent: r = 0.59 & technician: r = 0.60) we re reported by Breau and colleagues as evidence of the criterion validity of the scale (416) . This study used methods rat ed as 'good' and provide d moderate evidence to support the assertion that the VASobs is valid for assessing pain associated with immunisa tion. The sum of these results wa s not strong but is sufficient to suggest t hat the VASobs may also be valid when used to assess children aged between 3 and 12 years experiencing immunisation and needle -related pain. No studies were found that contributed results addressing VASobs validity in children older than 12 years of age. However, many studies recruited childr en with wide -ranging ages (n = 24) of SECTION 3 117 which 16 included but were not limited to children aged over 12 years, nine included but were not limited to infants and toddlers and all included but were not limited to children aged between three to 13 years. None o f these studies analyse d the data for different age cohorts separately making it impossible to credit positive results to more specifically aged infants and children . Where age ranges are similar between studies they h ave been grouped and described togethe r in the following section. Five studie s (four RCTs and one psychometric evaluation study) recruited children aged from two months old to seven years and provided evidence for this age range. The RCT re sults contribut ed very low (n = 3 ) (351, 368, 440) and moderate (350) levels of evidence that the VASobs can differentiate between known groups undergoing intravenous catheter (n = 3) and nasogastric tu be insertion and immunisation. Schultz and colleagues reported correlations between VASobs scores and Modified Pre -verbal Early -verbal Pediatric Pain Scale ( M-PEPPS ) scores that provide d limited evidence to support convergent validity (r = 0 .37 and 0.47) , particularly as the M -PEPPS had not had extensive previous psychometric testing (291) . In this study correlations with self - reported scores in children old enough to self -report were reported as rela tively strong (r = 0.63 & 0.92). Criterion validation in this study can only be accepted for those children that provided scores and as the stud y age range was 12 to 84 months and the age of th e children who provided self-reported scores was not reported w e can only speculate about the age group for whi ch criterion validation was demonstrated . The results of these studies are similar to those repo rted in studies that included infants and toddlers and children aged 3 to 12 years and were not strong enough to substantially strengthen the conclusions drawn earlier. In the remaining 19 studies with broad age ranges , all of which were RCTs , seven studies included infants and toddlers and the remainder included children aged over three years. The procedures included in th ese studies fell into two broad groups; needle related e.g. IV catheter insertion, venepuncture and port access (n = 12) and wound or fracture related procedures e.g. dressings, suturing and fracture reduction (n = 7). The consistency of the resu lts comparing self -reported pain scores between groups and the VASobs scores between groups was used in 14 RCTs (328, 355, 356, 363, 365, 366, 370, 379 -381, 387, 392, 394, 444) to establish w hether the VASobs was measuring a true relationship between groups or not. In 10 studies children providing self -reported pains scores was a subset of the total study populatio n and they ranged in age from children over 4, 6, 7 (n= 3), 8 and 10 years. Howe ver, in the remaining three studies , the authors reported that self-reported scores were provided 'where possible' and the age range was not defined (328, 381, 387). In the absence of robust alternative variables a ssessing the relationship between the known groups , these three RCTs were considered to make no contributio n to the evidence of VASobs validity. Therefore, these trials contributed very low (n= 6), low (n = 7) and moderate (n = 1) SECTION 3 118 levels of evidence of the scales capacity to differentiate between known groups for children aged 0 to 18 years. Responsiveness and convergence were tested in three studies (363, 418, 445, 446) . The quality of McClellan's methods for con vergence analysi s was rated as 'good' and correlations between VASobs scores and the modified Observation Scale for Behavioural Distress ( mOSBD ) scores was (r = 0.33) and self -reported pain scores was (r = 0.43) . Correlations between self -reported pain sco res and VASobs s cores could be considered evidence of criterion validity but the evidence supporting overall validity was only 'fair'. The other two studies contribute low and varied levels of evidence of convergence and therefore low evidence of the valid ity of the VASob s (363, 418) . The responsiveness of the scale was shown in all three studies, however, the co ntribution that they make to demonstrating the scale 's validity was weakened by methods 'rated as 'poor' (418, 445, 446) . The results from s tudies using wider age ranges did not add persuasive evidence to alter the conclusions drawn based on evidence from studies with narrower age ranges. Postope rative pain There wer e 21 studies identified which contributed to understanding the psychometric performance of the VASobs when used to assess postoperative pain. Following assessment of the quality of the studies and the results, we concluded that two tri als did not make sign ificant contribution to validation of the VASobs when used to assess postoperative pain in children. The remaining 19 studies include d samples ranging in age from neonates to 18 years. Only two studies focus ed specifically on a neona tal population. McNai r and colleagues correlated VASobs scores with PIPP and CRIES (Crying, Requires O2 for O xygen Saturation ) scores over 72 hours postoperatively with varied results ranging from 0.07 to 0.88 , using methods rated as 'good' (426) . The second psychometric evaluation study concentrating on neonates was designed to validate the largely untested PAT scale and reporte d correlations between VASobs scores and CRIES pain scale scores and PAT scale scores (r = 0.47 and r = 0.38, respectively) using methods described as only 'fair' (431) . Furthermore, the psychometric pro perties of the PAT scale had not been adequately demonstrated to consider this scale sufficient ly validated to support validation of the VASobs. These results d id not provide convincing evidence of the validity of the VASobs used to assess postoperative pa in in neona tes. SECTION 3 119 Table 5-4 Validity (hypothesis) results.

SECTION 3 123 Children aged from 1 month to 3 years was the age range of the participants in five studies (3 psychometric evaluation studies and 2 RCTs). The two RCTS, both from the same research group (405, 406) , contribute d evidence that the VASobs can distinguish between known groups. However, the results were not well supported an d the contribution that they mad e to the evidence of validity was considered low. Bai and colleagues reported excellent correlations between VASobs and FLACC (r = 0.86) but poor correlations with COMFORT -B scores (r = 0.31) both descri bed as evidence of criterion validity (412) . As the FLACC and COMFORT -B scales cannot be considered gold standard the methods were assessed as 'poor'. However, these results could be considered stronger evidence if assessed as convergen ce validation . Two other studies provided results for convergen t validity; van Dijk and colleagues reported correlations between COMFORT -B ranging from 0.64 to 0.83 and Ramlet and colleagues reported the results of Bland - Altman analysis (bias = 0.29, limits of agreement 1.78 to -2.37) (173, 428) comparing VASobs scores with Multidimensional Assessment Pain Scale (MAPS ) scores. However, the quality of the methods used to assess convergent validity were assessed as 'f air' and 'poor' and the MAPS had had limited psychometric testing, reducing the strength of the evidence for VASobs validity. The results drawn from these s tudies provide d insufficient high -quality evidence to claim that the VAS is valid for assessing postoperative pain in infants and todd lers. Four studies included children ranging in age from 3 to 12 years. One psychometric evaluation study correlated VAS obs scores with self -reported scores and reported widely varying results compared to the child's mother (r = 0.43 to 0.83) and nurse ( r = 0.23 to 0.54) and when coupled with methods assessed as 'poor' can only be considered to contribute low levels of supp ort for VASobs validity (427) . However, the quality of the second study examining criterion validity was rated as 'good' and the re sults were similar. The correlations between parent and nurse VASobs scores and self -reported pain scores were poor (r = 0.27) and fai r (r = 0.59), respectively. Considering the strength of these methods and consistency with the results of the other study, these results should be considered evidence that criterion validity is at best fair under these circumstances. Two RCTs provide d very low and low levels of evidence demonstrating the capacity of the VASobs to differentiate between known groups (398, 443) . Analysis of the responsiveness of the VASobs in a fourth study, also a psych ometric evaluat ion study, offered no support for the validation of the VASobs for this age group (443) . The sum of the re sults from these four studies did not provide evidence to consider VASobs valid for assessing postoperative pain in children aged 3 to 12 years.

Validity in this age group can only be inferred from the studi es providing evidence addressing validity in samples that include but are not limited to this age group. The final seven studies ( two psychometric evaluation studies and five RCTs) that contribute d evidence addressing validity for postoperative pain asses sment across much wider age ranges (from 0 to 18 years) included two studies where the sample included but w as not limited to infants and toddlers . Both studies were RCTs and were conducted by the same research team (403, 404) . They provide d very low levels of evidence to suggest that the VA Sobs can be used to differentiate between known groups in samples aged 1 - 18 and 1 to 7 years. Therefore, these studies offer ed little more to the assessment of the validity of the VASobs for infants and toddlers experiencing postoperative pain. All seven studies include d children aged over three years and all 5 RCTs (399-401, 403, 404) contribute d low level evidence of the validity of the VASobs used to assess postoperative pain in this age group. One of the two psychometric evaluation studies reported limited evidence to support the responsiveness of the VASobs and correlations with self -report th at ranged from 0.35 to 0.43 (429) . The methods used for criterion validity were assessed as only 'fair' making it difficult to determine wha t these results tell us about VASobs validation for these circumstances. The second psychometric study reported r esults demonstrating the capacity of the newly developed index scale to differentiate between known groups but with no difference shown for VAS obs scores between groups (434) . This s tudy was not an RCT and the quality of the methods were assessed as 'fair' . The results add ed nothing to our unde rstanding of VASobs validity. Illness/Injury related pain Finally, the psychometric performance of the VASobs used to assess pain related to injury or illness across a range of age groups has been tested in eight studies (410, 411, 4 13, 419 -421, 423, 430, 437) . The validity of the VASobs used to assess pain in children with juvenile arthritis (JA) was assess ed in five studies (411, 413, 419, 420, 437) . Correlation with sel f-reported scores was used to explore validity in four studies and results ranged from 0.24 to 0.45 (413) to 0.32 to 0.77 (411) . The quality of the methods was no higher than 'fair' for any of these studies. Thre e studies also assessed the convergence of VASobs scores with scores derived from other measures. The absence of analysis and significance testing prevented one study from contributing to the evidence of VASobs validity (437). Filocamo and colleagues ' study reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.54 to 0.82 for several measures (419) . However, it should be noted that all SECTION 3 127 measures for correlation were rated by the same obse rvers. Garcia -Munitis and colleagues demonstrated that correlations increase d if the rating instruments were on the same page of the data collection tool rather than presented separately (mothers' ratings 0.93 vs 0.79 and fathers' ratings 0.89 versus 0.73) (420) . Considering this it can be suggested that the act of rating t wo constructs at the same time i s likely to increase convergence independent of the convergence in scores that occurs when valid tools for assess ment are used to measure related constructs. This reduced the contribution that the results of these two studies ma de to our understanding of VASobs valid ity. Based on limited evidence we can suggest that the VASobs is only likely to achieve fair levels of validity when used to assess the pain experienced by children with juvenile arthritis ( JA). The remaining four studies used samples of children aged fr om infancy to 18 years experiencing more acute illness and injury related pain. Singer reported correl ations between self -reported pain scores and VASobs scores for children with acute pain presenting to the ED (430) . The quality of the me thods was 'good' but the results for different observers were markedly different (parent r = 0.47 and clinician r = 0.008). Kelly and colleagues in a very similar study reported higher levels of correlation (r = 0.63) between parent and child scores. Howev er, they examined absolute agreement using a Bland -Altman plot and reported substantial variation betw een scores (bias of 5mm with 95% limits of agreement of -38 to 47 mm). Furthermore, the RCT results provide d no evidence of the capacity of the VASobs to detect a difference between groups. In fact, the results were the reverse of those achieved f or CHEOPS scores between groups. There wa s insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the validity of the VASobs when used to assess acute pain. SECTION 3 128 Table 5-6 Validity (criterion) results.

Althoug h the results of several studies have becom e available since publication of van Dijk and colleague's review of the psychometric properties of the VAS applied by an observer, in which they called for more psychometric testing, the findings of the current re view were similar to those reported by thes e authors (290) . This is particularly concerning given the frequency of t he scale's use in research. In this review alone, where studies were restricted to higher quality studies RCTs (Jadad score of at least '3' (338) ), 66 studies used the VASobs to measur e a study outcome. It is likely that there are many more studies in the published literature using the VASobs to measure pain intensity despite insufficient data to recommend it for this purpose. In some cases, the data gave rise to concern that the scale may be unsuitable. Traditional ly, authors use terms such as; content and face, construct, criterion, concurrent, predictive and discriminant to describe different types of validity. However, these terms would be better used to describe methods of assessme nt that are used to explore val idity rather than to imply that there are different types of validity (265) . Validity i s more appropriately considered a single quality and refers to whether the scale measures what it is designed to measure (265) . This means that the results from these different methods of assessment cumulatively contribute to an estimate of validity. This is particularly true where there is no 'gold standard' a gainst which the scores can be compared to determine the true accuracy of the scores. These assessment methods are therefore indirect measures of validity, making it critical that the validity of a scale is tested using multiple methods (447) . Furthermore, it is increasingly ac cepted that testing can only demonstrate the validity of the scores rather than the scale as validity is not an immutable quality of the scale but rather will vary depending on the circumstances under which it is applied and should therefore more rightly b e attributed to the scores rather than the scale (265) . And finally, it is simplistic t o consider that the results from studies assessing the psychometrics of a scale (or the scores generated by application of the scale under specific circumstances) can be interpreted as binary (e.g. evidence that reliability o r validity is present or absent ). This is well illustrated by Knutsson's study which reported ICC for interrater reliability of 0.66 using methods rated as 'good' (443) . It would be inaccurate to conclude from these results that the VASobs is un reliable, but these results also do not support an assertion that the scale is highly reliable. It would be fairer to suggest that these results indicate that the VASobs can be ap plied by observers with moderate levels of reliability. Results are interpret ed considering the strength of the results, the quality of SECTION 3 132 the methods, the range of methods used, the population and circumstances to which it was applied and the extent to which the absolute accuracy of the scores is clinically important (330) . The quality of the methods used in psychometric evaluation studies is often not high enough to place great confidence in the results and therefore the contribution that they make to our understanding of th e psychometrics of a scale and the studies in this review were no exception. The methods of the studies included in this review were most often rated as 'poor' and 'fair' with only two studies using methods rated as 'excellent'; (reliability (424) and criterion validity (416)) and as a result conclusion drawn by the authors of studies must be viewed cautiously. Furthermore, the authors of these studies reported with considerable reserve, recognising the limits of the evidence that address VASobs ps ychometrics. For the purposes of this review we grouped studies and analysed psychometric properties for different arbitrarily generated age ranges that we considered might potentially demonstrate differences in pain related behaviours (448-450). It was thought that this may in turn influence VASobs scores, which are an observer's global impression of the pain experienced by the infant or child, and impact on the psychometric performance of the scale for different ag es. It was surprising to find that a substantial number of the psychometric evaluation studies included samples of children spanning very wide age ranges and did not report sub -analysis for narrower age groups. The results of the studies in this review can only contribute to a n understanding of the psychometrics of the scale for the circumstances and age group for which it was tested, and they were often not strong. Although speculative it is possible that the results for different age groups in these studi es may have differed making it more or less suitable for some cohorts of children. Encouragingly several methods have been used to assess VASobs validity which include; hypothesis testing, convergence, criterion validation and responsiveness. In 2002, Van Dijk specifically ca lled for studies to assess the responsiveness of the VASobs and although a total of 10 studies reported in this review assessed VASobs responsiveness, all but one of which was published since van Dijk's 2002 review, the quality of the methods used in nine of these studies were rated as 'poor'. The reviewers were not blinded to the circumstances in four studies, which may have influenced the observers' scores and created a false difference in scores over time. Finally, another four studi es reported results t hat were either not statistically significant or that did not include significance testing. The most convincing results address the responsiveness of the VASobs to procedural pain and yet it remains insufficient to accept that the scal e is responsive even for procedural pain across a range of ages. SECTION 3 133 Criterion testing was used in 15 studies assessing the performance of the VASobs under a range of circumstances and the quality of the methods used was 'good' (n = 4) or 'excellent' (n = 1) in a third of these studies, increasing our confidence in the results from these studies. However, the results of the studies using criterion testing varied widely with correlations between observer applied VAS scores and self -reported pain scores ranging from 0.008 (430) to 0.92 (291) . Correlations of almost zero suggest that the scale does not measure the same construct as self - report of pain and should be abandoned for measuring pain intensity i n infants and children unable to self -report. At odds with this are the results of studies that report near perfect correlations which would support accepting the VASobs as an ideal proxy measur e for pain in infants and children unable to self -report. Van Dijk and colleagues also reported that the observer scores for acute pain were often lower than those self -reported and we found nothing in the studies in this review or in the adult literature (451, 452) to persua de us that this is not a consistent pattern which places patients at risk of poor pain management if decisions about treatment of acute pain are based on observer reported VAS scores. In most circumstances the results for RCTs eligible for this review com paring VASobs scores between groups were not well supported by the results of comparisons between related but independent variables (i.e. self -reported pain scores). For this reason, these studies infrequently contributed more than low levels of evidence t o suggest that the VASobs can be used to distinguish between known groups. The validity of the VASobs was also tested using correlations between VASobs scores and scores obtained using other pain scales or scores for constructs considered likely to correla te strongly with pain such as; distress, disease severity etc. Interpreting these results relies on having an excellent understanding of the data that supports the validity of scores derived from the alternative measure. So often this becomes cir cular as c orrelations between scores for different combinations of scales with limited evidence of validity are used from one study to the next to support the validity of these scales. Taddio's work to establish the validity of the VASobs is an excellent e xample of the challenge faced by researchers using an alternative measure to support the validity of the scale of interest. In this study the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) was used for this purpose (433) . However, i n earlier work inten ded to demonstrate the validity of the MBPS, MBPS scores were correlated with VASobs scores (288) . This approach may only be accepted as a method to determin e the extent to whic h these two scales measure the same thing. Interpreting the net result of the convergence data in this review is further complicated by inconsistent comparators and variable results. Researchers have been criticised for using correlat ion coefficients suc h as Pearson's r, that measure the existence of an association between variables but do not address absolute agreement (290) . There is a growing trend towards the use of analysis techniques better suited to address the SECTION 3 134 questions researchers and clinicians have about the performance of measurement scales such as the VASobs. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a measure of reliability that provides a model for absolute agreement. Furthermore, it is better suited to circumstances where different observers rate the same phenomenon across several observations rather than where the aim is to determine the relations hip between two constructs rated for the same observation (453) . Although van Dijk called for this in 2002 to provide greate r clarity about whet her the VASobs can be reliably used to assess pain , only four studies included in this review used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to report reliability (331, 417, 424, 433) . The res ults from these studies vary (ICCs ranged from 0.52 to 0.97) and when coupled with the results of the remaining studies which were primarily of low quality we were unable to make confident recommendations about the reliability of the VASobs for all age gro ups and circumstances. However, there is sufficient ly promising data for seve ral age groups and circumstances , particularly procedural pain and postoperative pain in children, to echo van Dijk's call for more high -quality studies designed to address VASobs reliability . Intra -rater reliability of the VASobs has received scant attention and only two studies identified for this review, both published since van Dijk's review, reported results of an assessment of intra - rater reliability. In both cases the VAS obs was used to a ssess procedural pain (331, 433) . Again, the results were variable (ICC ranging from 0.52 to 0.82) and the methods used were rated as 'poor' and 'fair' and were not sufficiently robust to accept th at these results contribute to our understanding of the intra -rater reliability of VASobs. Limitations There are several limitations to this review. The review was restricted to studies published in English and available in full text. It is unclear what role the results of validation of the VASobs used by non -English speakers may play in understanding the scale validity used with English speakers. Unpublished studies or work not available in full w ere also excluded for pragmatic reasons. As there is a sig nificant publication bias towards studies with positive results it is possible that results that demonstrate that the VASobs is not reliable and not valid remain unpublished. The search strategy was designed to maximise the number of eligible studies found . However, it is possible that relevant studies were not identif ied and that they may have contributed valuable results. The VASobs was applied by different observers in these studies which included; nurses, physicians and parents . It can be argued that t he VASobs applied by different reviewers could be SECTION 3 135 considered a different scale. We did not examine data addressing the psychometrics of the scale used by different observers separately which is a limitation of this review. Conclu sion and recommendations Although there are large numbers of studies reporting on various psych ometric measures of the VASobs when used to measure pain there are insufficient numbers of robust studies contributing strong positive results supporting the reliability and validity of the VASobs to recommend it for infants and children for clinical and research pu rposes. However, there is some data to suggest that t he VASobs can be applied with a fair level of reliability and that it may show reasonable validity when used to assess immu nisation related pain. Based on some promising results, widespread acceptance of this scale, and the scales practical advantages we w ould recommend that studies of high quality evaluate the psychometric properties of this scale . Studies using larger sample sizes, a range of validation methods that include; responsiveness, capacity to distinguish between known groups and discriminate bet ween pain and non -pain-related distress and appropriate data analysis techniques which include analysis of data based on na rrower age ranges and use of appropriate statistical tests are urgently needed to support conclusive recommendations about the scale' s continued use . SECTION 3 136 Addendum: New literature An updated search was completed in the last week of May 2018 to identify studi es published since the original search was completed in Aug 2016. More recent published data comes only from RCTs and of these, five studies were eligible for consideration (i.e. procedural pain assessment, Jadad score 3 etc.) and confirm the capacity of the VASobs to distinguish between groups based on differences in pain (361, 387, 454 -456). These studies assessed interventions across a range of procedures which included: intr aosseous pin removal, burns dressing, immunisation, intravenous cannula insertion and laceration repair. They also included similar and wide age ranges (infancy to adoles cence) except for Cohen and colleagues ' study examining the role of distraction in reducing immunisation related pain in pre -schoolers. Implications These results add to the weight of promising evidence supporting the potential for VASobs to provide a val id option for assessing procedural pain in infants and children. However, they are insufficient to alter the recommendations of th is systematic review. SECTION 3 137 6 CHAPTER 6 A systematic review of the FLACC scale for assessing pain in infants and children.

Addendum: New literature An updated search was completed in the last week of May 2018 to identify studies published since the original search was completed in Aug 201 4. Two psychometri c studies have been conducted since the 2015 systematic review of the FLACC; one of which involve d testing a translated version of the FLACC scale (333) and would have been deemed ineligible for inclusion and the other test ed reliability when used to assess pain associated with burns dressings (334) . Shen and colleagues' study increased our understanding of the factors that impact on the accuracy of FLACC scores when used to assess procedural pain . However, this study did not contribute to an assessment of the psych ometric properties of the scale used for procedural pain assessment. The third psychometric evaluation study published since this systematic review was completed i n an emergency department but did not assess procedural pain an d therefore made no contribution to an assessment of the FLACC scale to assess procedural pain (457) . Nineteen RCTs and one systematic review with meta -analysis used the FLACC scale to assess procedural pai n have also been publish ed since this systematic review. These studies include participants aged from 1 month to 17 years and most focus on treatments aimed at alleviating the pain associated with immunisation, venepuncture or IV cannula insertion and dental procedures. A published meta -analysis was excluded as scores derived using the FLACC scale were pooled with scores generated using other scales for analysis. The quality of the RCTs was examined and nine met the quality requirement for inclusion. Of the se studies, four reported results that did not add evidence to support the capacity of the FLACC scale to differentiate between known groups. The results of the remaining five were conflicting: three studies provided moderate support for the scales capacit y to differentiate between groups (458-460) while two studies provided negative evidence for the scales capacity to differentiate between groups (461, 462) . Two RCTs incl uded methods to assess the inter -rater reliability of the scores allocated in the study. In both cases the methods used were assessed as 'fair' using the COSMIN Checklist and the results were expressed as kappa scores (0.79 (463) and 0.89 (462) ) SECTION 3 159 Implications The studies that have been published since the systematic review do not add gr eatly to the data that was summarised in this systematic review. There are two studies tha t confirm the assessment of the reliability of scores when the FLACC scale is used to assess procedural pain. However, the sum of the RCTs do not support the validity of the scale for procedural pain assessment. The recommendations of the systematic review would not alter with the inclusion of more recently published studies.

Addendum: New literature An updated search was completed in the last week of May 2018 to identify studies published since the original search was complet ed in July 2016. Since publication of the systematic review summarising MBPS psychometric data (332) and our prospective study (464) no psychometric evaluation studies have been published to provide addition al evidence and there are no new recommendations regarding pain assessment. Seven RCTs using the MBPS to measure a study outcome have been published and all but one was focused on i nterventions to alleviate immunisation related pain. This study evaluated t he effect of lidocaine on the pain associated with urinary catheter insertion and the results do not add evidence to support the capacity of the MBPS to measure pain (465) . Of the six RCTs concentrating on immunisa tion related pain, only two studies provided additional data to support the capacity of the MBPS to assess immunisation related pain (466, 467). SECTION 3 174 Implications There is no data to alter the conclusions drawn from th e original review regarding MBPS use to assess pain for procedures other than immunisations. Furthermore, the studies that have been published since the review also focused on immunisation -related pain and do not change the weight of evidence sufficiently to alter the conclusions or recommendations of the published systematic review regarding use of the MBPS for immunisation -related pain assessment . 175 Section 4 is comprised of five chapters that describe the methods used to conduct a prospective evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Face, Legs Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale, the Modified Behavioural Pain Scale (MBPS) and the Vi sual Analogue Scale applied by an observer (VASobs) used to assess procedural pain in infants and c hildren aged 6 to 42 months.

Protocol amendments The protocol was prepared and submitted for publication prior to completing the prospective study. Seve ral amend ments to the published protocol provided in this chapter were made and they are described in th e following section s. Sample The protocol described two samples: patient and reviewers. The patients included in this study were as described in the protocol: 100 infants and young children (aged 6 - 42 months) undergoing one of the four nominated painful or non -painful procedures. A sample of 25 clinicians was sought for the study and 26 were recruited. The protocol also report ed the intention to recruit a samp le of psychologists and s ix psychologists participated in this study. However, their data has not been reported in this thesis . Instruments The instruments used in the study were as described in the published protocol. No changes were made to these instr uments. Procedure The study was completed using the procedure as described in the protocol. All data described was collected during the study and the video segments were also prepared and presented to reviewers as described in the published protocol. Statistical analysis Results from this study are reported in the following chapters (chapters 9 to 12). The data were analysed a s described in most cases e.g. intraclass correlations and Bland -Altman plots for SECTION 4 190 reliability testing. However, there are several variations to what was described in the protocol. The responsiveness of the scales was tested using l inear mixed modelling as intended but an interaction between procedure type and procedure phase was added to the original model to account for the relation ship between these two factors . In addition, the mean difference between baseline scores and procedure scores for painful and non-painful procedure were compared using the Student 's t-test, which was not described in the protocol . Comparisons using Student's t-tests were also made between the scores for the procedural phase of painful and non -painful procedures . Finally, to determine the capacity of the scales to differentiate between procedures at different cut -off scores, s ensitivity and specificity and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using receiver operati ng characteristics (ROC). This analysis was also not described in the published protocol. The protocol also describes collection of data that has not been presented in these chapters and this include s: time -based variables, clinicians' assessment of appropriate management for the pain &/or distress exhibited by the patient and data resulting from review of the video segments by the six psychologists recruited. This data , along with the unpub lished data reported in the thesis, e.g. VASobs related data, will be analysed and reported via publication fol lowing submission of this thesis . SECTION 4 191 9 CHAPTER 9 The psychometric properties of the Visual Analogue Scale applied by an observer to assess procedu ral pain in infants and young children. The results of the psychometric properties of the Visual Analogue Scal e applied by an observer (VASobs) used to assess procedural pain in infants and children are reported in this chapter. This work is unpublished a nd is presented here formatted for the thesis. Abstract Introduction: The VAS obs is one of the most practical ways to assess pain in infants and children unable to self -report their pain. Despite widespread use, t here is insufficient data to recommend it for assessment of procedural pain. Therefore, t he aim of this study was to test the psychometric and practical properties of the VASobs to quantify procedural pain in infants and young children. Methods: Twenty -six clinicians independently applied the VASobs to segments of video collected from 100 ch ildren aged six to 42 months undergoing a procedure. Video segments were scored by four reviewers. Results: Reliability (intra - and inter -rater) was poor to fair (ICC ranged from 0.35 to 0.55). At a cut-off score of 3, sensitivity and specificity were 84 .7% and 95.0%, respectively. Linear mixed modelling confirmed scale responsiveness to pain . Pain scores increased across phases (baseline to procedure) for painful procedures (regression slope 4.95) and more modestly for non -painful procedures (regression slope = 0.41). The c orrelation between FLACC and Visual Analogue Scale observer (VASobs) pain and FLACC scores was good (r = 0.74 ). VASobs was easily applied and preferred by clinicians in this study. Discu ssion: Despite evidence of sensitivity and respo nsiveness to pain, incongruously the reliability results were sufficiently poor to raise concerns about the VASobs for assessing procedural pain in infants and young children. SECTION 4 192 Introduction Infants and chil dren are frequently exposed to painful and distressing procedures during their health care and management of the pain associated with these procedures has gained increasing attention in the clinical and research literature. Key to improveme nt of the proced ural experience is accurate assessment of procedural pain. Ideally this is achieved by self -report. However, infants and young children do not have the verbal or cognitive skills to report and quantify their pain intensity. Therefore, clini cians and resear chers are reliant on proxy measures to estimate pain intensity . Multidimensional observational pain scales have repeatedly been proposed as a viable option to support pain assessment in infants and children. However, scales can be complex and impractical for use, particular ly for clinical application . In contrast , the perceived ease with which the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) can be applied and the validity of self -reported pain scores served as the impetus to use this scale, applied by an observer (VASobs ), to assess the pain experienced by younger children and infants unable to self -report . Use of the VASobs is seen most frequently in the procedural pain literature. Our recent , as yet unpublished, review of the research literature show ed that the VASobs w as used three times more often to measure procedural pain in RCTs than other behavioural pain scales (chapter 3). The VAS is a line measuring 10cm with verbal anchors at each end , most commonly 'no pain' and 'worst possible pain' , which c orrespond to a s core of '0' and '10' respectively. It is widely used to assess adults and older children able to self -report (118, 345-348) and patients are asked to place a mark on the otherwise unmarked line to indicate the pain they are currently experiencing. The distance from the zero mark is me asured and this is considered the pain score (118, 345) . Applicati on of this scale by an observer is similar; the observer place s a mark on the line to indicate their perception of the intensity of the patient's ( e.g. infant or child) pain. Despite widespread application of this scale by an observer, the psychometric ev idence to support use of the VASobs to assess pain in infants and young children is limited (Chapter 5 ). In 2002, Van Dijk and colleagues summarised the results of studies contributing to our understanding of the psychometrics of the VASobs used to quantif y pain intensity in infants and children (290) . The authors concluded that interrater reliability (correlation coeff icients ranging from 0.36 to 0.91), correlation with self -report (0.23 to 0.83) and correlations with other pain measures (0.42 to 0.86) were variable , making it difficult to draw conclusions about its potential performance in even similar circumstances . They also concluded that the absence of adequate data addressing reliabi lity, scale responsiveness and optimal cut -offs prevented drawing conclusions about the SECTION 4 193 role that this scale might have for pain intensity assessment. A recent review, completed in 2016 , does little to change our understanding of how well the VASobs perfor ms when used to assess pain in infants and children (Chapter 2 ). In light of such widespread use establishing the psychometrics of the scale is critical. The aim of this study was ther efore to fill this gap in the literature and to test the psychometric and practical properties (feasibility, reliability, validity and clinical utility) of the VASobs to quantify procedural pain intensity in infants and children aged from six to 42 months to determine its suitability for clinical and research purposes. Meth ods The methods for this study are described in the published protocol which was presented in Chapter 8 (468) . Results Twenty -six ED clinicians were recruited for this study and made 1088 observations of 100 children at the first review and 358 at the second review (Figure 9-1). There were no missing observations as reviewers could not advance unless each data field was co mpleted. The clinicians included; 19 nurses of varying levels of experience (range 1 to 20 years , mean 10.1), 12 with postgraduate specialty training in paediatrics and/or emergency care and seven doctors of whom three were considere d senior (defined as ha ving completed their specialty training). The mean age of the children was 22.5 ( \u00b110.3) months, 58% (n = 58) were boys and 38% were diagnosed with respiratory disease, 29% with dehydration and gastroenteritis, while the remaining 36% spanned a range of dia gnoses. The mean, median and distribution of VASobs scores across the phases of each procedure from review session one are presented in boxplots in Figure 9-2A-D. Mean VASobs (pain) scores during the procedure phase were highest for nasogastric tube inser tion (6.4 \u00b1 2.0) and lowest for saturation measurement (0.7 \u00b1 0.86). The VASobs (distress) scores followed similar patterns but were universally higher than pain scores; the mean nasogastric tube insertion VASobs (distress) score was 8.1 (\u00b1 1.8) and satura tion measurement score was 2.7 \u00b1 (5.2).

A B C D SECTION 4 196 Psychometric evaluation Feasibility and clinical utility Reviewers were able to allocate a VASobs (pain) score on all but 10 scoring occasions ( 0.9%) and a distress score on all but two scoring occasions (0.2 %). The correlation between the first score allocated after one uninterrupted view of the video segment and the final score allocated was near perfect (r = 0.97). As scores were not normally d istributed, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to demonstrate that the there was no statistically signi ficant difference between first and final scores for either group (Table 9-1). Table 9-1 Comparisons bet ween first score and final score. Scale First score Final score scores changed by 1 Correlation* P value** VASobs (pain) 1.6 (2.7) 1.6 (2.7) 8.8% 0.94 0.63 VASobs (distress) 3.7 (3.7) 3.6 (3.7) 9.9% 0.92 0.58 Values are mean (standard deviation) / media n [interquartile range] * Spearman correlation coefficient ** Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction Reviewers used a L ikert scale to indicate the extent to which they agreed (5) o r disagreed (1) with a series of utility statements. R eview ers agreed (score of 4 or 5) that the VASobs (pain) was; to apply . However, the extent to which they agreed that the VASobs 'reflects procedural pain -specific features' was lower (53.8%) and lower still when they rated the extent to which they agreed that the scale is 'readily understood and supports decisions about pain management' (26.9%) and is 'clinically useful'(26.9%). Finally, few reviewers agreed that the VASobs 'reflects the extent of procedural pain' (14.8%) or 'discriminates children with pain from those w ithout' (18.5%) . Reliability The overall ICC for inter -rater reliability for the VASobs (pain) scores was 0.55 (Table 9 -2). Reliability varied across phases and procedure types; ranged from 0.27 (baseline, non -painful procedures) to 0.48 (procedure, painful procedure ). Overall reliability for VASobs (distress) was SECTION 4 197 higher ICC = 0.78 and ranged between 0.60 and 0.89 across procedures and phases. The extent of the variation between reviewe r scores for VASobs (pain) and VASobs (distress) are demonstrated in Figures 9-3 and 9-4 where standard deviations of the difference in scores are plotted against the reviewers' mean scores. There is a subtle trend towards higher levels of inconsist ency fo r scores allocated from the middle of both scales (2 to 7) when compared to the variation in scores allocated from the extremes of either scale (0 to 1 and 8 to 10).

Similarly, a significant difference between VASobs di stress scores during the procedural phase of painful (6.9 \u00b1 2.8) and non -painful (2.0 \u00b1 3.0) procedures was shown t(422) = -17.13, p < 0.000 . This demonstrates a difference between to two procedure groups. To confirm the capacity of the VASobs to different iate between p ainful and non -painful procedures at different cut -off scores for VASobs pain and VASobs distress, we also calculated sensitivity, specificity and AUC using receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The results for various cut -offs are report ed in Tables 9-5 and 9 -6. It can be seen from these results that a VASobs pain score of '3' provides the best sensitivity (84.7%), specificity (95.0%) and AUC (0.90) and that a VASobs distress score of 3 also provides the best sensitivity (91.5%), specific ity (77.5%) an d AUC (0.84) for VASobs distress.

This wa s repeated for VASo bs distress scores where the mean difference in distress scores from baseline to procedure for children experiencing a painful procedure (5.51 \u00b1 2.94) was significa ntly different to the mean difference in distress scores between phases for children experie ncing a non -painful procedure - 6.86, p < 0.000. Responsiveness was also tested by linear mixed modelling to determine the impact of procedu re and phase on VASobs pain and distress scores (Table 9 -5 and 9 -6). Both variables were considered fixed effects and reviewer and child were added to the model as random effects . From the model we can see that pain scores at baseline were a little over ze ro (intercept = 0.13) as were distress scores (intercept = 0.429). Pain scores increased across phases (baseline to procedure) for painful procedures (regression slope 4.95) . Th e difference across phases for non -painful procedures is substantially more mod est (regression slope = 0.41) Distress s cores across phases (baseline to procedure) incre ased for painful and non -painful procedures. However, this change was much more pronounced for painful compared with non -painful procedures (regression slope 5.52 vers us 1.52, respectively).

Mean pain scores were significantly lower than di stress scores for each comparison; overall (1.9 vs 3.09, t -test(2126) = -10.36), painful procedures (2.38 vs 4.03, t - test(714) = - 18.95), non -painful procedures (0.33 vs 1.19, t -test(361) = -8.69), (0.27 vs 0.90, t -test(412) -8.58), vs 3.83, t -test(243) = -13.98 ) and procedural phase painful procedures (5.38 vs 6.86, t -test(238) = - 11.91 and procedural phase non-painful procedures (0.56 vs 2.01, t -test(180) = - 8.17). Convergent valid ation Correlatio ns between VASobs pain with other behavioural scales Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale and the Modified Behaviour Pain Scale (MBPS) were both 0.74. The correlations between distress scores (VASobs distress) and FLACC scores (r = 0.89 ) and MBPS scores ( r = 0.87) were higher than when correlated with VASobs pain scores . The Spearman correlation coefficient for pairwise correlation between VASobs scores for pain and distress was = 0.77 . Scatter plots of the comparisons between scores are s hown in Figure 9 -9 and this shows an obvious trend towards lower VASobs pain scores compared with VAS distress scores and to some extent compared with FLACC and MBPS scores. SECTION 4 207 Discussion The frequency of use of the VASobs to assess pain in infants and children underscores the critical need to better understand the psychometrics of the scale when used for this purpose. The aim of this study was to address this deficit in the literature, specifically by assessing the feasibility and clinical utility, reliability and validity of the scale used to assess procedural pain. Despite some results from this study suggesting that the VASobs pain is valid for assessing procedural pain, the results of this study raise some interesting questions about the role of the VASobs in paediatric practice. The validity of the VASob s to assess pain in infants and young children experiencing procedural pain was tested using several methods and the results of each confirm the capacity of the scale to Figure 9-9 Distributions for the scores of each scale on the X axis , correlations between the scores for the scales on the X and Y axis and plots of scores on the X ax is again st the scores for the scale on Y axis are shown . Note : correlations were calculated using Spearman correlation coefficient . SECTION 4 208 measure the pain associa ted with intravenous catheter and nasogastric tube insertion. The responsiveness of the scale was also demonstrated with a marked increase in pain across phases particularly for these painful procedures (although it is worth noting that scores also increas ed for non-painful procedures but to a much lesser extent ). Observer VAS pain scores correlated well with FLACC scale and MBPS scores (r = 0.74), which have both been shown sensitive to pain (464, 469) . As pain a nd distress often go hand in hand it was not surprising to find that the correlation between VASobs pain a nd VASobs distress was high (r = 0.77). However, for a scale to be considered specific for pain it should also be able to differentiate between pain a nd distress . Baseline phases and the inclusion of presumed non -painful procedures were an opportunity to d etermine whether VASobs pain scores were specific for pain or were in part a measure of non -pain related distress. Comparison of the VASobs pain score s with VASobs distress scores showed that pain scores were significantly lower than distress scores for no n-painful circumstances. Furthermore, the capacity of the VASobs pain and VASobs distress to distinguish between painful and non -painful procedures wa s confirmed. However, this was at a cut -off of 3, which has been described as the upper limit of 'mild' pa in (470) . It should also be noted that mean pain scores for phases and procedures presumed not to be painful were not zero. As reviewers were asked to apply both scales, this may have prompted a conscious attempt to diff erentiate between these constructs that may not occur if VASobs pain is applied on its own. The VASobs p ain and VASobs distress proved practical and reviewers largely agreed that the VASobs for pain assessment was easy to understand and 'quick' and 'easy to apply'. In addition, restraint, the procedure or other factors rarely impinged on reviewers' capacity to score the infant or child's pain (n = 10) or distress (n = 2). However, reviewers were less positive about the scales capacity to measure procedura l pain . Only a quarter of reviewers agreeing that the scale was 'readily understood and supportive of deci sions about pain management' or 'clinically useful' and even smaller numbers agreed that the scale 'discriminates children in pain from those without' (18.5) and 'reflects the extent of procedural pain' (14.8%). An absence of clinician confidence in the va lidity of the scale has substantial ramifications for how clinicians interpret and respond to VASobs scores. Research findings and clinical assessment results that do not accord with the clinician's perception may be easily dismissed based on a fundamental assumption that the scale is not clinically useful or capable of measuring procedural pain. Inter -rater reliability results for VASobs pain were no t strong (r = 0.55) and poor across phases for both painful and non -painful procedures (0.27 to 0.48). Res ults were better for VASobs distress, the overall ICC was 0.78 and ranged across phases for painful and non -painful SECTION 4 209 procedures from 0.60 to 0.89. This may reflect a willingness on the part of the reviewers to accept the behaviours as evidence of distress b ut in the absence of a visible painful stimulus a reluctance to accept these behaviours as evidence of pain, rather than a reflection of a clear capac ity to differentiate distress -related behaviours from pain -related behaviours. Intra -rater reliability was markedly higher VASobs pain scores (r = 0.77) but almost identical for VASobs distress scores (r = 0.81). The scatter plots highlight a predictable t rend for scores more polarised towards the anchors to show less variation than for scores from two to seve n. Reviewers are likely to differ in their perception of the 'intensity' of the behaviours seen and therefore the intensity of the score where the beh aviours do not conform to the extremes, but they may also differ in how they interpret these behaviours, i .e. as evidence of pain or as evidence of distress. It has been traditionally accepted that if something is not reliable it cannot be considered vali d and the theoretical rationale for this is sound. For a scale to accurately measure a construct (validity ) it must be able to do so consistently when applied by different reviewers repeatedly (inter -rater reliability) and repeatedly by the same reviewer w here no change in condition has occurred (intra -rater reliability). However, in this study scores were not highly reliable, but the scores were shown to be sensitive and responsive to pain. These results suggest that a theory such as this oversimplifies ou r understanding of the relationship between these psychometric properties. Reliability is s hown in degrees (as has been demonstrated here) rather than as an absolute (present or absent) and therefore the effect of reliability on validity will strengthen or weaken validity in degrees. In this study the reliability of VASobs pain scores was only f air. Therefore, regardless of the strength of the validity results, based on the reliability results the validation results can only be considered at best fair. Strengths and Limitations This was a single centred study and reviewers could not be blin ded to the circumstances e.g. needle insertion. Furthermore, establishing the validity of one measure based on correlation with another can be considered circular logic. Until recently, there was insufficient data to accept the FLACC scale and the M BPS as well validated for procedural pain assessment (330, 471) . Therefore , use of these scales for convergence testing was a limitation of this study. The use of video recordings may have altered the experience of the reviewer compared with real time assessment impacting on their scores, particularly those that relate to feasibility. Several strategies were employed to overcome the impact of these limitations . Unique reviewers were used to assess each phase of a s ingle procedure to prevent reviewers from creating logical SECTION 4 210 patterns in the scores across phases of a procedure. Application of the scale after a single uninterrupted view of the video segment to generate the first score was used to simulate as closely as possible the clinical application of the scale . In addition, multiple methods were used to establish validity to o vercome the limitations of each validation method. Studies addressing the psychometric properties of pain scales frequently use non -clinical re search assistants and their results used to claim validity of the scale for clinical use. However, as there is so me evidence that clinicians apply clinical judgement when applying assessment scales (472-474), using clinicians provided an opportunity to test the assumption that the scale will perform adequately when applied by clinicians. These methodological limitations should be consid ered when interpreting the results of this study . Conclusions and future directi ons Extensive review of the literature confirms that the VASobs is frequently used for procedural pain assessment in infants and young children in clinical trials in the absen ce of robust evidence to support this practice. The purpose of our study was to e valuate the psychometric performance of the VAS obs pain when used to assess procedural pain in infants and children and to make recommendations about its use for clinical and research purposes. There remains insufficient data to support its psychometric pr operties and despite frequent use, too little clinician confidence in its capacity to be useful to recommend it for this purpose.

Too f ew '0' observations to perform analysis based on a cut -off of '0' Implications This analysis highlights the limitations of the MBPS. Although, sensitivity was very high, and specificity was good, this was achieved at a cut -off score of 4. A scale where scores differentiate painful from non -painful at a score of 4 makes interpretation very difficult as a score of 4 has also been defined as the lower end of moderate pain (470) . This result strengthens our concern about using the MBPS to assess procedural pain and the recommendation to regard scores as an indicator of distre ss and not exclusively pain. The full implications of this analysis is given more a ttention in the discussion (Chapter 13) . SECTION 4 235 12 CHAPTER 12 Comparing the psychometric properties of the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the observer applied Visual Analogue Scale use d to assess procedural pain. This chapter reports a comparison of the psychometric properties of the Face, Legs, Activity, cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale, the Modified behavioural Pain Scale (MBPS) and the Visual Analogue Scale applied by an observer (VASobs) used to assess procedu ral pain in infants and children. This work is currently unpublished and is presented here formatted for the thesis. Abstract Introduction: The Face Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability scale (FLACC) and the Modified Beha vioural Pain Scale (MBPS) are ob servational pain scales considered valid for procedural pain assessment. The Visual Analogue Scale applied by observers is a widely used alternative. However, it is not clear whether one performs better for this purpose. The aim of this study was to compar e the psychometric and practical properties (reliability, validity, feasibility and utility) to quantify procedural pain in infants and young children. Methods: A convenience sample of twenty -six clinicians used the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs t o segments of video from 100 children aged six to 42 months undergoing a procedure. Results: The FLACC scale resulted in more incomplete scores (p < 0.000) than the other scales . Reviewers liked the VASobs (pain) most, cons idered it quickest and easiest t o apply but all scales were considered of limited use for procedural pain assessment . Observers changed their MBPS scores more often than they changed FLACC or VASobs scores, but the degree of change was greater for FLACC sc ores (p = 0.033) . Inter -rater re liability was poorest for VASobs pain scores (ICC - 0.55). VASobs pain scores were lower than FLACC and MBS scores during the procedure but MBPS scores were higher during non -painful phases (p < 0.001) . The FLACC scale provi ded the best sensitivity (94.9%) and s pecificity (72.5%) for the lowest cut -off score (pain score 2). Correlations between FLACC and VASobs (distress) were strongest (r = 0.89 ). SECTION 4 236 Discussion: This study support ed the reliability and sensitivity of the FLAC C and MBPS. There were practical concerns for application of the FLACC scale and the MBPS and doubt about the capacity of both scales to differentiate between pain - and non -pain related distress exist s. The VASob s, although practical, was less reliable tha n either the FLACC scale or the MBPS. The results of this study demonstrated that the FLACC scale may be be st suited for procedural pain assessment. SECTION 4 237 Introduction Pain assessment informs decisions about treatme nt and is a frequent outcome measure in tria ls evaluating methods designed to reduced pain. The generally accepted standard for pain assessment is self -report, however for those unable to self -report the most practice d and recognised alternative is the obs ervational pain scale . Over 40 tools have be en identified in the literature (212) . Despite the freq uency with which infants and children experience painful medical procedures, the appropriate choice of assessment strategy to assess procedural pain in infants and young children for clinical and research purpose s is far from obvious. There is widespread recognition that procedural pain, particularly in infants and young children, may manifest differently to other types of pain, e.g. postoperative and chronic pain. However, few scales are recommended for this pur pose and fewer still have been purposefully designed for procedural pain assessment. Although many scales are used in circumstances other than for which they were originally designed most are not suitable for procedural pain assessment. They are often not supported by sufficient psychometric data an d/or the design makes them unsuitable e.g. non - standard metrics to accept them as fit for purpose. Recent systematic review s of the properties of three observational pain scales, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry Con solability (FLACC) scale (330) , the Modified Behavioural Pain S cale (MBPS) (471) and the Visual Analogue Scale ap plied by an observer (VASobs) [ Section 3, Ch apter 2 ], prompted work to assess the performance of these scales when used to assess procedural pai n in infants and young children . The MBPS was developed at a time when few scales were available and were not considered sufficiently able to capture the variability in responses in young infants to procedural pain (288) . The validity of the MBPS for procedural pain assessment until recently is largely supported by the results of studies addressing the scale's perfo rmance when used to assess the pain associated with immunisation in infants and young children (471) . In contra st, the FLACC scale was originally designed to assess postoperative pain in infants and children aged two months to seven years (28) and is now one of the most well -known and widely recommended pain asse ssment scales (15, 30, 475, 476) . Despite this, a vailable data, summarised in a 2015 systematic review, was i nsufficient data to recommend FLACC for procedural pain assessment (330) . Finally, the VASobs, a unidimensional scale based on the VAS used for self -report of pain, has been extensively used to assess procedural pai n in infants and young children, particularly for research purposes (Chapter 3). This is despite two systematic reviews concluding that there was inadequate data to support the psychometric properties of this scale for this purpose (290) (Chapter 5). SECTION 4 238 A recent psychometric evaluati on study assessed the performance of these three scales used to assess pain associated with procedures frequently experienced by infants and young children aged six to 42 months of age during an emergency department presentation. The results for each scale have been previously reported/published in detail in previous chapters and associated publ ications (464, 469) . In summary, the FLACC scale and the MBPS were reliably applied by clinicians. However, results reaffir m long held concerns about the reliability of the VASobs when used to asses s pain (290) . The sensitivity of all scal es to procedural pain was demonstrated but none could be shown to be highly specific for procedural pain. There were circumstantial factors, such as restraint and the steps of the procedure that interfered with application of the FLACC and the MBPS. In con trast, the VASobs was confirmed as easily applied and rarely affected by circumstantial factors that interfered with application of the other scales. Data also gave rise to concerns about the design of the MBPS. Infants and children in this study infrequen tly scored '0' even for procedures and phases of procedures not considered painful. The aim of this study was to compare the psychometric and practical properties of the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs used to assess procedural pain in infants and yo ung children to provide decisive recommendations for clinicians and researchers regarding scale selection for clinicians and researchers. Methods The methods for this study are described in the published protocol which is presented in Chapter 8 (468) . Results The mean age of the children was 22.5 ( \u00b110.3) months and 58% were boys . Thirty -eight percent were diagnosed with a respiratory disease, 29% with dehydration and ga stroenteritis, while the remaini ng 36% spanned a range of diagnoses. Twenty -six ED clinicians participated ,19 nurses and seven physicians. The nurses reported varying levels of experience ranging from less than one year to twenty years (mean = 10.1 years ) and 12 (63%) had postgraduate sp ecialty training. Three of the seven physicians had completed specialty training. Clinicians allocated s cores that ranged across procedures and phases from zero to 9.5 and mean and median scores were highest for nasogastri c tube (NGT) insertion (FLACC 9. 5 \u00b1 - 8.8 IQR 5.3 - 8] 8.5 IQR 9.5]) lowest for measurement 2], ). VASobs pain scores were lowest for all phases of all procedures except for the procedural phase of SpO2 measurement. MBPS scores were highes t for all baseline and preparat ion phases and the procedural phase of intravenous cannula insertion. Mean and median scores are reported in Table 12.1.

The most frequent impediment to allocation of items for the FLACC scale and MBPS was restraint. Uniquely, the absence of attempts to console the child prevented the allocation of a score for the FLACC item 'conso lability' item on 30 occasions. Using a Likert scale reviewers indicate d the extent to which they agreed (5) or disagreed (1) with statements (Table 12.3) . Reviewers rated the utility of the scale similarly for a number of items: clinically useful, able to discriminate children with and without pain, reflective of procedural pain specific features . Comparison between FLACC and MBPS ratings using Wilcoxon signed rank sum revealed no statistically significant difference s in ratings between the FLACC scale and MBPS. However, larger numbers of reviewers agreed that the VASobs was 'quick ' and 'easy' to apply when compared with their response for the FLACC scale (z = 4.15, p < 0.000 and z = 2.081, p = 0.037, respectively) an d the MBPS (z = 3.023, p = 0.003 and z = 2.043, p = 0.041, respectively). When asked to rank the scales in order of p reference, reviewers liked the VASobs the most (n = 14) and the MBPS the least (n = 11) (Table 12.4).

All scales demonstrate the capacity to distinguish between known groups (painful versus non -painful procedures). However, the FLACC scale provided the best sensitivity (94.9%), s pecificity SECTION 4 246 (72.5%) and AUC (0.83) for the lowest cut -off score (FLACC score 2). The MBPS w as most sensitive (91.4%) and specific (77.5%) at the highest cut -off score (MBPS sc ore 4). The scores for each scale across phases for painful versus non -painful procedures can be seen in Figure 12.1 and visually demonstrates the responsiveness of all scales to pain. Independent t -tests were used to determine whether the mean difference in score s across phases differed for painful versus non -painful procedures. The responsiveness of the FLACC scale, MBPS and the VASobs to pain (mean difference from baseline to procedure) differed significantly for painful versus non - painful procedures (F LACC 6.09 \u00b1 3.36 pain 0.42 \u00b1 0.99, p < 0.000 ). These observations were also tested by linear mixed modelling to determine the impact of procedure and phase (f ixed effe cts) on scores where the children and reviewers were considered random effects. The model indicates that there was an average increase of 5.9 for FLACC scores, 4.2 for MBPS scores and 5.5 for VASobs pain scores across phases for children undergoin g a painf ul procedure. Responsiveness was more modest for non -painful procedures with an average increase of 1.8 for FLACC scores and 1.5 for MBPS scores and markedly so for VASobs pain scores (average increase = 0.4). VASobs distress scores showed a simil ar patter n with an average increase in scores of 5.5 for painful procedures and 1.5 for non -painful procedures . Independent t -tests were run to determine if there were differences in the mean change in scores across phases of the procedure for infants an d childre n who had higher scores prior to the procedure than those with lower scores prior to the procedure. For children undergoing a painful procedure, the mean difference in scores across phases for both scales was significantly different for children w ith basel ine scores less than three (FLACC 7.01 \u00b12.90 , MBPS 5.71 \u00b11.94 ) compared with three or more (FLACC 2.70 \u00b1 2.72 , MBPS 1.72 \u00b1 0.000 1 and p = 0.0000 , respectively. As there was only one child with a mean VAS obs pain score at baseline over '3', this analysis was not completed for VASobs pain. The c orrelation between FLACC and VASobs pain (r = 0.74 ) and MBPS and VASobs pain (r = 0.74) were identical and very similar for VASobs pain and VASobs distress scores ( r = 0.77). The correlations between FLACC and MBPS and VASobs distress scores were stronger than for VASobs pain scores (r = 0. 89 and r = 0. 87, respectively ). The relationships bet ween scores for the different scales are shown in the scatterplots provided in Figure 12.2, where scores allocated by the clinicians for one scale are plotted against scores allocated with an alternative . With the exception of VASobs pain and VASobs distre ss, where distress scores show a tendency to be higher, there are no obvious patterns in the relationships between scores for different scales.

Abbreviations: FLACC - Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability, MBPS - Modified Behavioral Pain Scale, VASobs - Visual Analogue Scale observation Discussion We ha ve previously shown that the FLACC scale, the MBPS and VA Sobs pain are sensitive to pain but that they each have limitations to their capacity to differentiate pain related and non -pain related distress (Chapters 9 - 11). Our intention in this study was to determine which scale, FLACC scale , MBPS or VASobs pain , is better suited to assessing procedural pain experienced by infants and young children. A comparison of the scores across scales reveals an obvious trend for VASobs pain scores to be lower than the score allocated using the other scales. It has been sh own that VASobs scores for acute pain are generally lower than self -reported scores (416, 423, 477, 478) . Although it is not SECTION 4 250 possible to replicate these results in a sample of children too young to self -report it i s possible that observers using the VASobs would also underestimate pain in this age group. If we accept this, we could assume that the FLACC scale and MBPS scores, which were higher than VASobs scores, more closely represent self -reported scores. Clinical ly underestimated and undertreated pain is a greater concern for infants and children receiving healthcare than is overestimation or overtreatment (479) supporting our concerns about a scale that consistently scores lower than others. In contr ast, MBPS scores for eight of the ten phases were higher than the scores allocated using other scales and, in both cases, these were procedural phases (naso gastric tube insertion and oxygen saturation measurement). Very few observations resulted in an MBPS score of 'zero' and averaged almost 'two' even at baseline. This might be best explained by a p ossible flaw in the design of the scale. The descriptors for 'face' and 'cry' items require the infant to be 'smiling' and 'laughing or giggling', respectively, to achieve a score of 'zero'. The absence of these behaviours does not necessarily equate to the presence of pain. This is particularly relevant for childr en undergoing procedures other than immunisation where the context, the more extensive preparation a nd the concern of their parents is likely to heighten their pre -procedural fear and anxiety making smiling and giggling unlikely. All scales were shown to be responsive to pain, demonstrated by marked increase in scores across phases (baseline to procedur al). Responsiveness of scores to the pain associated with painful procedures was highest for the FLACC scale with an average increase of 5.9, closely follow ed by the VASobs pain with average increases of 5.5. The responsiveness of MBPS scores was slightly lower with average increases of 4.2. To establish the capacity of these scales to differentiate between pain and non -pain related distress the responsivenes s to pain for infants and children demonstrating distress in the baseline phase (score 3) was compared with those who were more settled (score < 3). The responsiveness of the FLACC scale and the MBPS scores was blunted for infants and children distressed at baseline . Although this may reflect the natural tendency for the difference be tween two unrelated variables , the values of w hich are randomly selected from within discrete limit s, to be smaller if the differences are compa red for two groups base d on higher and lower values of one variable , it may reflect limited capacity for these scales to differentiate between non -pain related and pain -related distress. This analysis could not be completed for the VASobs pain scores as t here were so few observations scoring at least three in the baseline phase. This is likely to reflect the use of separate VASobs for pain and distress which allowed reviewers to distinguish between pain and non-pain related distress in a way that the FLACC scale and MBPS did not. Finally, analysis of the scales' responsiveness for non -pain related procedures was intended to support our understanding of the scales ' capacity to differentiate between pain and non-pain related distress. A highly specific pain s cale should ideally show no response or increase in scores in circumstances where there is no increase in pain, i.e. a non -panful procedure. The SECTION 4 251 average increase in scores across phases for non -painful procedures was more modest, although not zero, for the FLACC scale (1.8) and the MBPS (1.5) but almost zero for VASobs pain (0.4). This implies greater specificity for pain for the VASobs pain than the FLACC scale a nd the MBPS , which may be the result of the capacity for the observer to make allowances for th e context when making their assessment of pain using the VASobs . These co ncerns about the capacity of the scales to differentiate between pain and non -pain rel ated distress was shared by the reviewers who reported in the utility survey that they did not consider either scale well suited to procedural pain assessment, or capable of differentiating children with pain f rom those without or supporting clinical decis ions about pain management. However, our greatest concerns about capacity for discrimination li e with the MBPS. Scores for segments of video featuring infants and children presumed not to be in pain (baseline, preparation and non - painful procedures) were s ignificantly higher for MBPS than the FLACC scale and even at baseline averaged almost two. Thi s impacted on the degree of responsiveness demonstrated by the MBPS compared with the FLACC scale and the VASobs pain . VASobs distress scores followed similar patterns to the FLACC scale and MBPS scores and an average increase of 5.5 was seen for painful procedures and 1.5 for non -painful procedures. This similarity in the way the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs responded to pain was reinforced by strong co rrelations between the VASobs distress scores and FLACC scale scores (r = 0.89) and the MBPS sc ores (r = 0.87). The correlation between the FLACC scale and MBPS scores was similarly high (r = 0.88), while all correlations between VASobs pain scores and the other scales were slightly lower and ranged between 0.74 and 0.77. The FLACC scale and MBPS were reliable when applied by clinicians in this study and one scale cannot be considered more reliable than the other. This is perhaps not surprising given the similarities between the scale s and that each review er applied both scales. However, despite the similarities between these scales significant differences existed between the scores allocated using these two scales for most phases. Furthermore, the practica l performance of the two scales was not consistent . Reviewers more often changed their score wh en given an opportunity to review the video segment when applying MBPS, but scores changed more significantly when applying the FLACC scale. Furthermore, reviewe rs were unable to score FLACC items more often than they were unable to score MBPS items result ing in fewer complete FLACC scores. These results suggest that the FLACC scale may have more practical limitations than the MBPS. In contrast are the results for VASobs pain and VASobs distress. Reliability for both scales was markedly lower than for FLACC and MBPS while the practical performance of the VASobs exceeded that of the FLACC scale and the MBPS; scores were more often complete and changed less frequentl y. SECTION 4 252 Furthermore, reviewers rated it as much easier and quicker to apply and indicated a preferen ce for the VASobs pain for pain assessment over the FLACC scale and the MBPS. Strengths and limitations There were strengths and limitations to this study. Thi s was a single centre study and reviewers could not be blinded to the circumstances e.g. needle insertion. However, several strategies were employed to overcome the impact of these limitations . Including a larger than usual sample size and the use of uniqu e reviewers to assess each phase of a child's procedure. Multiple methods were used to establis h validity to overcome the limitations of each validation method. Finally, it was not possible to statistically compare all psychometric properties of the scales and our results and conclusions are to some extent based on a pragmatic comparison of the perf ormance of the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs pain and VASobs distress scales. Conclusions and future directions The reliability of the VASobs challenges results that suggest that it may be the most valid scale for assessing pain and differentiating pain and non -pain related distress. Furthermore, scores were consistently lower than FLACC scale and MBPS scores raising concerns about the potential for VASobs scores to underestimate pain. For this reason, the VASobs cannot be recommended. Although the MBPS was designed to assess procedural pain, the evidence suggests that it does not perform as well as the FLACC scale to differentiate pain and non -pain related distress . Questions about the design and performance o f both the FLACC scale and the MBPS remain which prevent unreserved support for the use of either scale to assess proce dural pain. Based on these results we cautiously recommend the FLACC scale for procedural use but advocate for accepting scores as a measure of procedure -related distress and not as a measure of procedure - related pain. We also recommend review and potentia l revision of the scale to improve practical application and align item descriptors with empirical data. 253 The final section of this thesis is presented in a sing le chapter and summarises the key findings arising from this work and discusses the implications of these findings. Recommendations for clinical and research practice and based on this work are made. Finally, the remaining gaps in the literature are highli ghted and suggestions are made as to how best to address these gaps in our understanding via future research initiatives. SECTION 5 254 13 CHAPTER 13 This thesis was underpinned by three research questions each addressed in separate p hases of work . The first was a det ailed interrogation of the literature to identify observational behavioural assessment scales that could be considered potentially suitable for assessment of procedural pain. The second phase included three systematic revi ews to summarise existing psychome tric data to determine the extent to which the three scales' (FLACC scale, MBPS and VAS obs) psychometric properties when used to assess procedural pain are supported. The final stage was prospective and tested the psychome tric properties of three observati onal scales (FLACC scale, MBPS and VASobs) used to assess procedural pain in infants and young children aged 6 to 42 months undergoing one of four painful and/or distressing procedures. The results of this work have addres sed these questions and bring us c loser to achieve our aim which was to identify an observational pain scale that could be used clinically and for research purposes to assess procedural pain in infants and young children. The aim of this chapter is to summarise the key findings of this wo rk and place them in context of the existing literature and understanding of these scales and draw conclusions about their use. Table 13.1 lists the research questions and directs the reade r to the chapters that report the results and provide more comprehe nsive discussion of the implications of these results of each phase of work. In this chapter, the results of each phase will be integrated to provide an overall assessment of the implicatio ns of this project to support recommendations for clinical practice and research. Table 13-1 Research questions and the chapters that report the results and discussion . Research question Chapter 1. Is there an observational pain assessment scale considered suitable for asses sing the procedural pain experienced by infants and young children? Chapter 3 2. Is this scale/Are these scales supported by sufficient psychometric data to recommend the scale for use Chapters 5 to 7 3. Can the selected observation scales be recommended for p rocedural use following psychometric testing? Chapters 9 to 12 SECTION 5 255 Key findings The first two phases of this project provided a comprehensive summary of our understanding of the use of behavioural pain scales to assess procedural pain in infants and young children. The increasing focus on the assessment of paediatric pain has resulted in the proliferation of observational behavioural pain scales for this purpose. Over 10 years ago Duhn and colleagues reported the existence of at least 40 scales (286) and then in 2017 Anderson and colleagues in a systematic search of the literature, identified 65 unique scales for assessing pain in neonates, infants and children (480) . Despi te these numbers there are few clear recommendations regarding the most suitable scale for procedural pain assessment. Two systematic reviews published in 2007 made recommendations bas ed on limited evidence and the absence of suitable alternatives (30, 31). These revie ws concluded that for procedural pain assessment in infants and children, the FLACC scale and the CHEOPS showed the most promise but that the evidence supporting these scales was still limited . A working g roup of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists and Faculty of Pain Medicine has recently made similar recommendations to those of the two systematic reviews and with similar reservations following extensive review of the literature (15). We established criteria to help identify an existing scale that might be suitable for assessing procedural pain in infants and young children too young to self -report. The absence of str ong support for the recommendations made to date was apparent in the results of our attempts to identify accepted scales (based o n our criteria for acceptance) , which are reported in Chapter 3 . A total of 32 different scales were used to assess procedural pain in the identified RCTs, which suggests a lack of consensus about the most suitable scale for use. Furthermore, very few expe rt associations, societies, academies and organisations made recommendations regarding pain assessment (8/71) and those that di d recommended four different scales (most commonly the FLACC scale). In contrast the VASobs was not recommended in any of these s tatements or in the two systematic reviews mentioned earlier. Despite this, the VASobs was used in the identified RCTs more tha n twice as often as other commonly used scales (MBPS and FLACC). Our search also confirmed that despite the significant numbers of scales and the increasing attention directed towards procedural pain assessment and management, only two scales were design ed for this purpose (MBPS (288) and EVENDOL (289) ). The EVENDOL was also designed to assess acute illness/injury related pain i n addition to procedural pain. This scale was excluded as it uses a 0 to 15 metric for scoring, did not meet the criteria for a cceptance and has not been tested in English. Eighteen studies testing the psychometrics of scales used to assess procedural pain concentrated on 13 scales and only three scales (MBPS, FLACC and VASobs) SECTION 5 256 were evaluated in more than two studies (Chapter 3) . Three scales were considered potentially suitable for use based on the criteria set a priori. However, this was insufficient to u nequivocally support use of these scales for procedural pain assessment. The inconsistencies exposed in this phase of work li kely reflect either insufficient data to confirm the scales' suitability or inconsistent interpretation of available data. These results supported the need for closer scrutiny of the psychometric data available for the eligible scales : the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs. Psychometric data Phase two and three of this thesis focused on comprehensively summarising available data describing the psychometric properties of the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs used to assess procedural pain and testing these properties in a prospective study. Although the systematic reviews summarised all psychometric data for the scales used to assess pain in infants and children, only the findings as they relate to procedural pain assessment will be referred to in this discussion. A brief integrated summary of the key findings from these phases is presented for each scale and a comparison betwee n scales. FLACC The FLACC scale is the most frequently recommended and the most extensively evaluated observational behavioura l scale identified. However, based on a systematic review of available data we could not conclude that there was sufficient suppo rt for the psychometric properties of the FLACC scale to recommend it for procedural pain assessment (330) . This conclus ion is more cautious than the one drawn 10 years earlier by von Baeyer and Spagrud who concluded that there was sufficient data to provisionally recommend the FLACC scale for procedural use (30). This may reflect the results of robust assessment of the qual ity of the studies included in the current review. This level of rigour has not applied to review of studies addressing scale performance and only a small number of studies were assessed as using methods rated as 'good' or 'excellent'. This reduced our con fidence in these results and lessened their contribution to an assessment of FLACC performance to ass ess procedural pain. To combat the lack of high -quality studies evaluating the psychometric properties of the FLACC scale used to assess procedural pain i n infants and children, a prospective study to provide this data was conducted in the third phase of this project. The resu lts from this study confirmed that procedural pain can be reliably and sensitively measured by the FLACC scale (469) . Inter - SECTION 5 257 observer agreement was high (intra -class correlation coefficients (ICC) ranging from 0.79 to 0.94 depending on the type and phase of the procedure and intra -rater reliability was similarly hig h (overall ICC 0.87). The mean difference between the scores was small ( -0.12), although the limits of agreement were wide ( -3.10 to 2.86). The responsiveness of FLACC scores to painful stimuli also supported the capacity of the scale to assess pain. Score s rose substantially from basel ine to the procedural phase of painful procedures (mean difference = 5.35). Sensitivity to pain was shown by the capacity of the FLACC score to differentiate between painful and non -painful procedures at a cut -off score of 2 (sensitivity 94.2%, AUC 0.83). However, specificity results, although promising, were not as convincing. The s pecificity at a cut -off score of 2 was 72.5% and did not improve much as scores rose. A comparison of the responsiveness of the scale to painful and non -painful procedures confi rmed that the scores rose much more from baseline to the procedure during painful procedures when compared to non -painful procedures. However, scores rose from baseline to the procedure during non -painful procedures (mean dif ference = 1.78). Although the m inimal clinical difference in pain scores for the FLACC scale has not been confirmed, based on the results from work to establish this for other scales (481, 482) it is likely that a rise of 1.78 reflects a clinica lly significant rise in pain score. Furthermore, the mean difference in scores across phases for children with higher scores ( FLACC 3) during the baseline phase was significantly lower than for children with lower baseline scores (FLACC scores < 3). Although may be influenced by the natural tendency for the difference between two unrelated variables , the values of which are random numbers selected from within defined limits , to be smaller if the variables are compared based on higher or lo wer values for one variable , these results raise questions about the capacity of the FLACC scale to differentiate between pain and non-pain related responses . This will be discussed in more detail in the following section addressing the implications of the results of this work. Clinicians also expressed concerns about the capacity of the scores to make a meaningful contribution to procedural pain assessment, s pecifically indicating a lack of confidence in the capacity to differentiate between procedural pain and non -pain related distress or influence treatment decisions. Furthermore, a substanti al number of scores (14.5%) could not be completed as items could n ot be scored due to the impact of restraint or the procedure itself . This is the first time that the feasibility of using this scale for procedural pain assessment has been explored and the results give rise to concerns about how well the scale performs in this context. MBPS Studies have largely concentrated on evaluating the capacity of the MBPS to assess immunisation related pain in infants and young children and this was reflected in the recently published results SECTION 5 258 of the systematic review reported in ch apter 6 of this thesi s (332) . The conclusion of this review was that the MBPS was supported by sufficient data to recommend the scale to assess immunisation related pain. However, although it was designed for ac ute pain and not spec ifically immunisation related pain, there was insufficient data available to make any assessment of the psychometrics of the scale used to assess pain associated with other procedures. The psychometric evaluation study conducted in the third phase of this work was intended to fill this evidence gap to provide a platform from which to make recommendations regarding use of the MBPS to assess pain associated with procedures other than immunisation. The results of the prospective study con firmed that the MBPS can be used reliably by clinicians (ICC 0.87 across all procedures and phases) (332) and that the scale is sensitive to procedural pain. Scores rose substantially from baseline to the proced ural phase of painful procedures and linear mixed modelling confirmed scale responsiveness to pain (mean difference 4.6). Furthermore, the MBPS was able to differentiate between painful and non -painful procedures with a sensitivity of 91.5% and specificity of 77.5% (AUC 0.85). However, these results were achieved at a cut -off score of 4, which has been defined as the lower end of moderate pain (470) . Furthermore, reviewers only recorded a score of '0' for 3.6% of observations despite three quarters of the segments scored depicting infants and children during phases and proced ures not considered p ainful. Based on these results, there is reason for considerable concern about the specificity of the MBPS for pain and the likely reasons for this and the implications will be explored later in this chapter. Finally, reviewers' rating s of their perception of the scale reflected their concern and they rated the scale unlikely to ' reflect procedural pain ' and unlikely to 'contribute to treatment decisions '. VASobs The VASobs is the observational scale used most frequently to measure pr ocedural pain in RCT s and yet our systematic review could not confirm the adequacy of the psychometrics of the scale used for this purpose. Over 15 years ago van Dijk and colleagues completed a systematic review to summarise the reliability, validity and c ut-offs points for th e VASobs to highlight the strengths and limitations of this scale (290) . They concluded that th e scale required addi tional testing, specifically to address intra -observer reliability, responsiveness and optimal cut -off points. The systematic review completed in phase two of this project (chapter 5) included 20 studies published since the 2002 review , of which 8 were foc used on procedural pain assessment. In addition, this review also included RCTs to provide validation data and 50 studies concentrating on procedural pain were analysed. Despite additional data, the conclusions from this review were si milar to those of van Dijk's review 15 years earlier. SECTION 5 259 Concern was raised in both reviews regarding the reliability of VASobs scores when used to assess procedural pain experienced by infants and children (290) . This concern has not been allayed by data from studies published since our 2016 review reported in Chapter 5 , which did not test reliability, or the results of the prospective psyc hometric study completed in phase three of this project. Our data confirmed an overall intra -class correlation of 0.55 for pain scores allocated by clinicians in this study and they were lower for procedures and phases of procedures considered not painful. When asked to apply the scale as a measure of distress reliability improved markedly (ICC 0.78). Intra -rater reliability was better for pain (ICC 0.77, mean difference - 0.64, \u00b1 1.93) and distress (ICC 0.81, mean difference - 0.09 \u00b1 2.27) scores. Review of available data in the systematic review reported in Chapter 5 was sufficient to suggest that the scale may be suitable for assessment of neonatal procedural pain and could be cautiously recommended for assessing immunisation relate d pain in infants, to ddlers and potentially older children. However, in the absence of data from studies focusing on alternative procedures no recommendations could be made beyond the one made for immunisation -related pain. The psychometric evaluation stud y conducted in phase 3 of this project provided prospective data regarding VASobs used to assess procedural pain. Pain scores increased predictably in response to painful stimuli (mean difference 4.95) and only a modest increase in scores was seen across phases of non -painful procedures (mean difference 1.52), confirming responsiveness of the scale to the painful procedures in this study. The scale was able to differentiate between painful and non-painful procedures with a sensitivity of 84.7% and a specifi city of 95.0% (AUC 0. 90) at a cut-off score of 3, although this has been defined as the upper end of mild pain (470) . The VASobs distress scores also differentiated between painful and non -painful procedures most accurately at a cut -off score of 3 but sensitivity was slightly higher (91.5%) and specificity was lower (77.5%). Predictably the corr elation between pain and distress scores was good (r = 0.77) and correlations with FLACC scale and MBPS scores were similar (r = 0.74). Finally, although clinicians did not show great confidence in the performance of the scale there we re very few occasions where they were unable to allocate a pain or a distress score using the VASobs. Scale comparison Comparison of the performance of the scales highlighted differences in their psychometric properties. There were significant difference s between the scores allocate d by each scale to the segments of video and MBPS scores were consistently higher during procedures and phases considered non -painful. This pattern did not extend to the procedural phases of painful procedures and FLACC scores were higher for nasog astric tube insertion than MBPS scores. In most SECTION 5 260 circumstances (phases and procedures) t he VASobs pain scores were lower than the other scale scores. The distress scores, while higher than VASobs pain scores, were also lower than the observation scales scores. All scales investigated were shown to be sensitive and responsive to pain. However, the FLACC scale results were more convincing than the results of other scales. Most notably, the FLACC scale, although similarly able to differenti ate between painful and non - painful procedures with similar sensitivity and specificity as the other scales did so at a lower cut - off score (FLACC cut -off 2, MBPS cut-off 3 and VASobs pain and distress cut -off 3). However, this was still at a score that is likely to have significant clinical imp act as it has been defined as 'mild pain ' (470) . The FLACC scale and the MBPS were similarly reliable when applied by clinicians to the range of procedures included in this study (ICC FLACC scale 0.92 and MBPS 0.87). Distress scores using the VASobs were also reliable (ICC 0.78). Ho wever, the reliability of VASobs pain scores was considerably lower (ICC 0.55). Reviewers had the most difficulty applying the FLACC scale and were unable to all ocate a score more often than when applying the other scales. Reviewers a ltered their MBPS scores most often following subsequent review of the video segment compared with the other scales . However, the difference between first and final FLACC scores was s ignificant but was not significant for the other scales. Despite th e problems that reviewers h ad with application of the FLACC scale, the MBPS was liked the least by reviewers and thought to perform worse than the FLACC on most measures of clinical utility other than those relating to ease and speed of application. The VASobs pain scale was ranked highest by over half of the participants (54%) and 88.5% and 84.6% respectively, agreed or strongly agreed that the scale was quick and easy to apply. It is of co ncern that reviewers were not convinced that any of the scales measured procedural pain well e nough to support clinical decisions. This may reflect an intuitive recognition of some of the problems highlighted by the results of this study, which are explore d in the following section. Implications of findings The results of this psychometric evaluat ion study are unique as there are very limited data addressing the psychometrics of observational pain scales applied to procedures other than immunisation. Furth ermore , significant attention has been focused on neonatal pain and distress and less on older infants and young children who are too young to self -report pain. These results serve to add to our understanding of the role that the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs may play in procedural pain assessment for procedures other than immunisation and i n age groups SECTION 5 261 other than neonates. In addition, they highlight several issues that relate to the design of these scales and the impact that this has on their psych ometric and practical properties. The impact of infant related and observer related influences on pain assessment are attracting increasing attention and although this was not the focus of the project, the prospective data alludes to the potential importan ce of these factors. The limited capacity of these scales to discriminate between pain related and non -pain related distress reignites the debate about whether behavioural scales should be considered pain, pain and distress or distress assessment scales. T he unique circumstances of medical procedures and the impact that they might have on the pain experience and responses have been illuminated in the prospective study of phase 3 . The work undertaken in this project has also unearthed several methodological concerns for researchers to address before additional efforts to assess the psychometric prope rties of pain assessment measures are made. Scale related factors The authors of the FLACC scale designed this scale to provide clinicians with a systematic approach to assessment of post -operative pain that was more easily recalled than some of the other options available (28). They u sed items from other scales and consulted with clinicians to inform the design before testing the reliability and validity of the scale to assess post -operative pain in infants and childre n aged 2 months to 7 years. The results of the prospective phase of this study may be the result of attempting to use a scale designed for an alternative circumstance to assess procedural pain. Reviewers had difficulty applying items of the FLACC scale , in particular legs, activity and consolability. They identified restra int as the factor most often impeding their ability to make an assessment of legs and activity. It is unlikely that restraint and the impact of an invasive procedure were considerations wh en the FLACC scale was developed for assessment of postoperative pai n and the current descriptors do not make provision for scoring these items under these circumstances. The consolability item was also difficult to assess on occasions as reviewers reporte d no attempt to console the infant or child. Furthermore, use of the term 'consolability' is out of step with current evidence regarding the use of non -pharmacological strategies for minimising pain. The Oxford English Dictionary defines to console as 'to make someone....feel better by giving them comfort or sympathy ' (483) . Evidence points towards a negative effect for some traditional comforting behaviours and that efforts to distract are more likely to have a positive effect on pain experience (484, 485) . In addition to the use of appropriate distraction techniques, the aim for management of procedural pain and distress should include reduction of the use of restraint. Nonetheless, revision of the items and/or thei r descriptors may be warranted to improve the feasibility of using the FLACC scale for procedural pain and to align it with current evidence. SECTION 5 262 In contrast to the FLACC scale , the MBPS was designed to assess 'acute iatrogenic' pain in young infants . The authors drew heavily on existing literature to design the MBPS and the scale includes items to assess facial expression, movement and cry (288) . Facial expression was described as the most specific response to pain but the coding systems for assessment available were acknowledged by Taddio and colleagues as burdensome. Taddio and colleagues used a simplified assessment of facial expression in the MBPS. Cry characteristics , although commonly used and supported by some data , were acknowledged by Taddio and colleagues as inconsistent. Nonetheless the authors included this item in the MBPS. Finally, they refer red to the potential for coding systems for body movements based on evidence o f behaviours associated with noxious stimuli similar to facial expression coding systems. Their aim was to provide a clinically applicable pain measure and they tested the psychometrics of this newly developed scale to assess immunisation pain in infants a ged 4 to 6 months with positive results. Despite the intended purpose of the MBPS scale and the robust approach to its design, the prospective study did highlight concerns about the design of the MBPS, in particular the face and cry items. As has been not ed, reviewers rarely applied a score of zero even to segments of video depicting children during non -painful procedures or procedural phases. Closer examination of the scale provides a potential explanation for this finding. The descriptor for a score of z ero on the face item requires the infant to be smiling and the cry item requires the infant to be giggling or cooing to receive a score of zero. The absence of these behaviours does not necessarily confirm the presence of pain. Both behaviours are unlikely for infants and children in unfamiliar circumstances surrounded by strangers. However, in the scales current form, even neutral emotions could be interpreted as pain. Consistent scores of 2 during non -painful procedures no doubt contributed to a cut -off score of 4 for MBPS scores to most accurately discriminate between painful and non -painful procedures. Inclusion of descriptors for scores of zero that provide for neutral facial expressions and the absence of vocalisation may resolve this issue. Facial e xpression is widely recognised as one of the most consistent and universal behavioural responses to pain and hence it is included as an item in most observational pain sales, including the two that have been studied here. However, there is increasing conce rn about how this item performs across scales and this may be a function of the design of the item. Chang and colleagues undertook a study specifically designed to examine the face item of six well -known scales, which included the FLACC scale but not the M BPS. They reported poor reliability for the FLACC scale face item (246) . The authors concluded that inconsistency of the descriptors compared with expressions recorded empirically in response to pain was likely the reason for variation in scores based on facial expression. This concern was not reflected in the current prospective study where SECTION 5 263 overall reliability for FLACC scores was very high (ICC 0.92), the kappa scores for the item scores ranged from 0.61 to 0.82 an d the face item kappa score was 0.72. This was traditionally considered substantial agreement, although increasingly it is argued that this might be too generous an interpretation of agreement for health related measures (486) . Nonetheless, these results are not consistent to those seen in Chang's study. These results potentially challenge Chang's concerns held about the descriptors of face item of the FLACC scale or alternatively, and perhaps more likely, lend support to the view that clinician judgement is exercised when applying pain scales, including the FLACC scale. This is discussed in more detail in a later sub - section of this chapter. The absence of strong empi rical work to identify sensitive and specific behaviours indicative of procedural pain may be at the heart of the problems previously described . Although scale authors went to some effort to ensure that the FLACC scale and the MBPS w ere based on behavi ours indicative of pain , there is not a strong body of evidence to support that the included behaviours and descriptors of the behaviours are consistently observed in infants and young children experiencing procedural pain . Finally, t he VASobs w as originally designed to support self -assessment of symptom in tensity. It had long been used for self-report of pain intensity before it was used as an observational tool to assess pain in pa tients unable to self -report pain intensity . Unlike the MBPS and the FLA CC scale, observers are not directed to specific behaviours when applying the VASobs. They are instructed to allocate a score based on their perception of the intensity of the pain exp erienced. The scores are therefore heavily influenced by the judgements of the observer and their understanding of the behaviours most likely to indicate pain. The impact of observer related factors on application of the scales and the scores allocated are discussed in more detail in a later section. However, it is can be sugg ested that the design of the VASobs allows for greater observer judgement to impact on the final score than the other two scales. Patient and observer related factors The Social Commu nication Model was developed by Craig and colleagues to explain paediatr ic pain (92, 487) . They considered an infant or child's response to pain a complex social interaction between the infant or child and their carer . In this model the infant or child experiences pain, genera tes an ob servable response and the carer interprets this response as indicative of pain and potentially initiates an action aimed at alleviating the pain or removing them from the source of the pain (harm). It is easy to see from this model that factors th at influe nce either the infant/child SECTION 5 264 or the observer are likely to impact on the pain responses exhibited or the judgements made as to how these responses should be interpreted . Several studies provide persuasive evidence to this effect (334, 473, 474, 488, 489) . The complexity of these relationship s and the challenge for researchers in their efforts to understand them is illustrated by studies reporting the impact of pain intensity on the psychometrics of scores. The relia bility and accuracy of pain scores has been shown to improve with higher score s (334, 473, 474, 488) . The findings from our prospective study where reliability for pain scores (VASobs pain, MBPS and FLACC) was high er in phases where scores were higher is consistent with these studies. These results may represent increasing consistency in the behaviours demonstrated by infants and children at higher pain intensity, more consistent interpretation of a range of behavio urs when these behaviours are demonstrated at higher intensity or a com bination of factors. In the following sections the relationship between clinician judgement and pain scoring and the relationships between pain experience, pain behaviours and individ ual infant/children related factors are used to reflect on the results of this study. Although no attempt was made in the prospective study to examine these relationships, the assumption that observer and patient related factors were likely to affect the p sychometric properties of the scores was responsible for the decision t o use multiple observers selected from a pool of clinicians and a larger than usual sample of infants and children. Observer judgement De Ruddere and colleagues have explored the impa ct on observers ' responses to pain of the presence or absence of potent ially painful pathology and other psychosocial influences (472, 473) . Observers reported lower pain scores, sympathy and inclination to help wh en there was no medical evidence for pain when responding to adult pat ient vignettes (472) . Furthermore, observers were less likely to be influenced by the patient's self -reported pain when psychosocial influences on pain such as : anxiety and emotional distress, were included i n the vignette. In a follow -up study using clinicians as observers rather than lay people , De Ruddere reported lower pain scores, less sympathy and greater suspicion of deception for patients where there is no medical evidence for pain (473) . The perception of deception and negative impressions of the patient were increased by the presence of psychosocial factors considered to influence pain. Recognition of a potential link between clinical data e.g. diagnosis and o bserver assessments of pain is not new. SECTION 5 265 Similar effects to those seen in De Ruddere's studies were reported in medical students over 20 years ago (489) . Medical s tudents ' judgements of pain were higher for patients who had medical evidence of a painful condition compared with those with no medical evidence of a painful condition. Furthermore, stud ents did not consistently under rate pain and for low intensity pain, students augmented the score slightly regardless of the medical evidence. Although the clinicians in our study were not given any clinical or demographic information about the infant or child in the video segment, it was not possible to blind the m to the i nfant or child's circumstances. Hence, it is possible that circumstances may have had similar effects on judgement as those seen in the studies described. A significant difference between VASobs pain and VASobs distress scores (1.9 vs 3. 09, t-test(2126) = -10.36) was shown , which may be the result of one of two possibilities; clinicians recognised behaviours that distinguished pain related distress from non -pain related distress or they interpreted the behaviours as indicative of non -pain related distress a nd not pain based on their perception of the level of pain or distress associated with the circumstances (e.g. absence of a painful stimulus during baseline and preparation phases and non -painful procedures). It is likely that the clini cians in this study used their judgement when applying the face item of the FLACC scale and very likely when applying the VASobs. Reviewers were fairly consistent in their application of the 'face' item of the FLACC scale. However, as noted earlier Chang a nd colleagues work reported considerable variability in scores for the face item which they attributed to the inconsistencies in the descriptors (246) . Even though clinicians in the current study were given the oppo rtunity not to scor e an item, they scored the face item in most cases and on those occasions where they were unable to do so this was not because of inconsistent descriptors. This implies that reviewers scored the face item based on behaviours they saw and assessed as most severe regardless of the descriptors provided. Furthermore, these results suggest that the clinicians in this study made similar judgements to other clinicians in this study regarding the facial expressions of the infants and children seen in this study. Go mez and colleagues make similar observations which they attributed to observers reinterpreting the descriptors for the face item to achieve consistent scoring (474) . It seems likely that clinicians apply personal j udgement if the scale item and/or descriptors do not accord with the behaviours they see and that this will reflec t their understanding of the behaviours representative of pain . In a series of studies, Pillai Riddell and colleagues have provided evidence that the application of judgement also affects the assessments made by parents (490-493). They have repeatedly shown that the variance in parental pain ratings was not explained exclusively by infant behaviours. Furthermore, they have demonstrated relationships between parental fact ors such as parental age, number of children and infant related factors such as the age and sex of the infant and parent reported pain scores. SECTION 5 266 Shen and colleagues explore d the impact of assessor and patient related factors on the accuracy of FLACC scale scores for children having burn dressing changes (334) . They reported that nurses with more than 11 years nursing experience agreed with the expe rt panel less often than nurses with less than 5 years experience (334) . They also found that nurses in their study were unable to distinguish between moderate and high pain (defined as FLACC scale score 4 and 6). Comparison between observer assessments and self -report of pain scores has repeatedly demonstrated that observers underestimate pain (423) and that this is more pronounced for clinicians (430, 494, 495) and with increasin g experience (496) . It was not the aim of this study to specifically examine the relationship between the demographics of the clinicians and their scores. Clinicians in this study were experienced (average of 10.1 years of experience, \u00b1 4.5 years) and only two nurses had less than 5 years experience. Therefore, sub-group analysis to compare the reliability of experienced and inexperienced clinicians was not possible. Researchers have exposed a concerning potential relationship between repeated exposure to the pain experience of others and observer judgements of the pain of others (497-500). Gregoire and colleagues reported reduced estimates of the pain intensity experienced by others following repeated exposure to images of facial expressions of pain. The interest in the relationship between exposure and observer assessments has been taken up by researchers using im aging to map brain activity. There is evidence that there is overlap between the regions of the brain that become active during a painful experience and those that become active when the pain of others is witnessed (501) . In re lated work, Gregoire's research group demonstrated that in addition to judging pain as less intense, there are changes in brain activity in observers following repeated exposure to facial express ions of pain (502) . In several studies the changes seen confirmed diminished brain activity in observers following repeated exposure to images of facial pain expressions (502, 503) . These observational and imaging studies may give us insight into our results, which showed lower VASobs scores compared with FLACC scale an d MBPS scores. In light of the absence of specific descriptors to guide assessment using the VASobs logic suggests that a pplication of the VASobs leaves more room for o bserver judgement than application of the two behavioural scales. Although not confirmed empirically, it may be surmised that clinician habituation to pain in part explains these observations. These studies and some of the results from the current prospe ctive study challenge us to consider the impact of observer related factors on the appli cation of pain scales and how observations are interpreted and scored and support the need for studies that aim to expand our knowledge of the factors that affect the w ay that observers assess pain. SECTION 5 267 Patient pain responses Attention has been increasingly devoted to establishing the role that patient related factors such as infant temperament , experience and the capacity to retain pain -related memories , might have on pai n experience and pain -related responses. Experience and memory and discussed in the next section as they are particularly pertinent to a discussion focused on procedural pain. In a systematic review aimed at identifying the factors that increase anticipa tory distress, the authors dr ew a link between temperament and anticipatory distress (504) . Other authors have attempted to understand the relationship between temperament and pain behaviours in response to immunis ation (505) . Stevens and colleagues demonstrated that by 2 months of age pain behaviours predicted parent a ssessment of temperament. Racine and colleagues point us to the developmental literature suggesting that children with internalising or ex ternalising problems also have problems regulating their affect which may in turn impact on the behaviours that these infants and children exhibit in response to pain. A longitudinal study mapping the responses to their 2, 4, 6 and 12 month immunisations h ighlighted the considerable variation in response to a similar stimulus of 750 infants (506) . Pillai -Riddell and colleagues recognised stable groups of infants at each age that de monstrated different patterns of response which became increasingly apparent with age. These results serve as the basi s for their concern regarding the validity of using overall group means as they deny the potential 'trait -like differences in affect regul ation, distress or pain responding'. Temperament and its impact on pain -responses were not examined in the prospecti ve study repor ted in Section 4 of this thesis . However, infants and children in this study were grouped according to their level of distre ss to determine whether pre -existing distress had an impact on scores during the procedural phase of the procedures. N egative emotions such as fear and anxiety are known to modify pain experiences by increasing pain perception (92, 507) . Counterintuitively, FLACC scale and MBPS scores in this study did not rise as much during the painful procedure in infants and children who were distressed at b aseline when compared with infants and children who were not distre ssed at baseline. This may be the product of the natural tendency for the difference between unrelated variables to be lower where the value of one variable is higher if the values of the variables are random numbers sel ected from within disc rete limit s or a real tendency for pre -existing distress to impact on a child's experience of pain or importantly it m ay refl ect poor capacity for the scale to measure pain and distress cumulatively. Similar results were found in Humphrey and colleagues ' study to determine the level of distress associated with venepuncture (508) . They r eported strong correlations between pr eparation phase distress and procedural distress in children and adolescents. More significantly, they reported that for the SECTION 5 268 majority of participants the distress during the preparation phase was the same as during the procedure phase. There are several ways in which the prospective results of this project can be interpreted , but in light of the work of Pillai -Riddell and others these results may reflect the existence of infant/child specific factors that alter their ex perience of or their behaviours in response to a stimulus. Alternatively, this may be linked to the phenomenon seen in the work of Rhudy and colleagues where pain responses in adults who were anxious increased while pain responses for those who were fearfu l actually decreased (509) . These studies underscore the complexity of the pain experience which has significant implications fo r interpreting pain scores based on th e assessment of behaviours thought to represent pain experience. Context -related factors Procedures create a unique set of circumstances likely to impact on the capacity to generate reliable and valid pain scores. Th ere are practical challenges to applic ation of pain assessment scales during medical procedures. Furthermore, children and infants are known to experience anticipatory fear and distress prior to and during medical procedure s, which are likely to influence their pain experience (12, 510 -512). The capacity to differentiate between the infant or child's responses to anticipatory fear and other aversive emotions from those associated with pain is vital for a scale inten ded to assess procedural pain. Anticipatory distress is a function of the perception of threat and this will be fed by memories of previous experiences of pain associated with an event (513) . Researchers have increased our understanding of th e capacity of infants and young children to retain pain -related memories (12, 514, 515) . The impact of memories on future pre -procedural distress was demonstrated in Taddio and colleagues' study of infants bor n to diabetic mothers. Infants who underwent repeated heel lances to check blood glucose levels following birth showed higher levels of distress in response to non -painful procedural cues such as skin cleansing when compared to neonates who had not experie nced heel pricks for blood glucose testing (12). It is worth noting that the same tool for assessment was used to measure pre -procedural distress and procedural pain, so this study not only provides evidence that neonat es remember painful procedures and that it affects anticipatory distress, it is also potentially evidence of the limited capacity of assessment tools to differentiate between pain and distress. The results of the current prospective study offer no insight into the role of memory or past procedural experience, but this literature may assist us to understand why some infants and children in our study exhibited behaviours suggestive of higher levels of pre - procedural distress than others. Our study was designe d to assess the psychometric properties of the chosen scales and not to explore factors that might impact on their experience. However, as SECTION 5 269 exposure to previous painful procedures was recorded and approximately half of the infants and children in our study were procedurally na\u00efve it would be possible to compare the scores of these two groups. Our results confirm long held concern that observational scales are not specif ic for pain -related distress (263) . In 2007, von Baeyer and Spagrud highlight how few studies repo rted results addressing the capacity of the scale to differentiate between pain -related and non -pain-related distress. Over ten years later, this gap remains in the re search literature. The studies reviewed in our three systematic reviews infrequently used discriminant validation methods and did not provide persuasive data to support the specificity of the FLACC scale, the MBPS or the VASobs for assessing procedural pai n (330, 332) . Procedures not considered painf ul (inhalational medication administration and oxygen saturation measurement) were purposefully included in our prospective study to assess the capacity of the scales to discriminate between painful and non -painful procedures . Receiver operating characteri stic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that all scales could make this distinction, the FLACC and MBPS with very high levels of Specificity althoug h high was slightly lower for t he FLACC scale (72.5%), MBPS (77.5%) and VASobs distress (77.5%), meaning that these scales, although likely to correctly identify most painful procedures as painful they were also likely to identify some non -painful procedur es as painful. This seems an ac ceptable compromise as over - assessment of pain is in most circumstances more acceptable than under -assessment of pain and the likely impact that this has on treatment. The VASobs scores performed similarly to the observationa l scale with the exception of V ASobs specificity which was notably higher than for other scales (95%). This may be explained by the inclusion of separate pain and distress scales to allow clinicians to make the distinction between pain and distress. As the clinicians were not blinded to the circumstances, they were able to decide whether the infant or child was likely to be experiencing pain and therefore whether the behaviours represented pain and/or distress. The most concerning result of the ROC analysi s was the cut -off score at whic h these results were achieved. The MBPS was most accurate (AUC 0.85) at a cut -off score of MBPS = 4, while FLACC was most accurate (AUC 0.83) at a cut -off of FLACC = 2. Pain severity based on scores for the FLACC scale, MBPS and the VASobs have not been de fined empirically . However, in older children able to self -report, m oderate pain has been defined as a Face Pain Scale -Revised (FPS -R) sc ore from 4 to 6 and mild pain as an FPS -R score from 1 to 3 (470) . Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the MBPS did not meaningfully distinguish betw een pain -related and non-pain r elated distress in this study. The FLACC scale fared much better but nonetheless, a cut - SECTION 5 270 off score of '2' makes scores of '2' difficult to interpret i.e. establishing whether they represent pain or non -pain related distress. C loser inspection of the data re inforces these results; scores (particularly MBPS scores) during phases and procedures not considered painful were not universally zero. As has been described this is likely linked to the design of the MBPS. However, it proba bly suffer s the same challenges as other observational scales related to differentiation of pain and non -pain related behaviours . Iannetti and colleagues provide d a very cogent argument to explain a significant logic flaw that they consider underlies the commonly accepted interpretati on of data from brain imaging studies (516). They argue d that researchers hav e applied reverse inference to make claims based on study data that demonstrate the regions of the brain that become active in response to painful stimulus . These results are used to sup port the reverse in ference that activity in these regions of the brain can be assumed to mean that pain is experienced. However, Iannetti and colleagues provide d considerable evidence to show that these regions of the brain are not specific to pain and may be activated under other circu mstances. Parallels can be seen between this and the literature devoted to observational pain -related behaviours. Behaviours such as specific facial expressions, cry and movement have been consistently observed in response to painful stimuli. Logic has bee n used to suggest that therefore observation of these behaviours must be associated with the experience of pain and that they can therefore be used to measure pain experience. The results of this prospective study and the abs ence of strong evidence from ot her studies does not support this inference and suggests that this may well represent similarly flawed logic to the inferences made based on imaging studies. These behaviours are likely to be indicative of pain but are also l ikely to be provoked by other n on-pain related behaviours as has been discussed. The contrasting view is that to suggest a distinction between pain and non -pain related distress can be made is a false dichotomy. Blount referred us to operant conditioning to explain the possibility tha t the distress associated with medical procedures is akin to pain (510) . He reasoned that through previous exposure to a painful procedure infants and children are con ditioned to the same experience in response to simil ar triggers even when the stimuli is not noxious. Based on this conditioning the distress experience during the preparation phase o f a procedure is felt by the infant or child as pain. Taddio and colleagu es applied this reasoning to the results of their st udy demonstrating the impact of repeated procedures and memory on pre -procedural distress (12). They proposed that repeated exposure conditioned infants to exhibi t pain behaviours in response to non -painful stimuli and that these infants may even be experie ncing pain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the feasibility of using the FLACC scale, the MBPS or the VASobs for procedural pain assessment and as has been described earlier the results SECTION 5 271 have raised questions about the feasibility of u sing the FLACC scale and to a lesser extent the MBPS for procedural pain assessment . Restraint was the most commonly cited reason for clinicians not to score an item on the FLACC scale and the MBPS. Notwithstanding the design related challenge of restraint on assessment , the impact of restraint on the infants and child's experience and their behaviours is unclear. It is conceivable that the act of restraining an i nfant or child provokes a response to the restraint which is independent of their response to o ther sensations that they may be concurrently experiencing. Restraint removes a sense of control and there is evidence that supports a relationship between perce ived loss of control and anticipatory fear and perceived pain (504) . Lacey and colleagues reported the impact of positioning for immunisation on children aged 4 - 6 years (517). Children who were placed in the sitting position prior to and for the immunisation were less frightened than children who were placed in the supine position. These findings suggest that restraint plays a much bigger part in procedural pain assessment than just interference with the capacity of the observer to score the behaviour. Sedation is widely recommended and has become common practice for managing the distress experienced by infants and children associated with diagnostic and therapeutic proced ures (15, 518-520). The impact of sedation on pain perception and behavioural responses to pain have not been studied. Infants and children in this study were not sedated for these procedures and these questions ar e beyond the scope of this project. However, as the use of sedat ion for procedures increases, this is a question that should be addressed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the experience of the infant or child and how best to assess this experience. Procedural interference was the second most often cited reason for being unable to score an item. Logically, procedures that involve the face e.g. nasogastric tube insertion and inhaled medication administration via face mask and spacer could be expected to interfere with scoring the facial expression. Equipment may obscure the face but direct contact with the face may also alter the expression e.g. wriggling the nose to avoid tube insertion or an attempt at local withdrawal in response to direct stimulat ion, such that they are no longer consistent with the facial act ions described by the item of the scale. So perhaps it is surprising how often observers were able to allocate a score for this item of the FLACC scale and the MBPS for these procedures. The d irect impact of different types of procedures on behaviours is u nknown but perhaps warrants attention when considering the assessment of procedural pain SECTION 5 272 Study design and analysis related factors Establishing the psychometric properties of measures such as pain scales is methodologically complex, particularly in the ab sence of a 'gold standard' against which the performance of the measure of interest can be compared. There has been an evolution in our understanding of what it means to validate a measure and the design and analysis methods needed to achieve this rigorous ly, which in turn impacts on interpretation of results based on methodological factors In the absence of a gold standard to which the scale of interest can be compared, studies should employ multiple validation methods to indirectly build a case for valid ity (447) . Psychometric evaluation studies have traditionally used several methods to support the validity of the scale and they include c orrelation between the scores of the scale of interest and another measure (see Table 4-3). These results should be interpreted cautiously. In most circumstances where this method is used the reference scale is not supported by sufficient data to confidently claim that the scale is valid. This method is based on circular logic which was clearly illustrated in Taddio and colleagues ' studies to establish the validity of the MBPS and the VASobs (288, 488) . This was described in more detail in Chapter 5 , but in sh ort both scales were used as a reference scale to support the validity of the other. The net result of these studies is evidence to confirm that these scales measure the same thing but not what they are measuring. Responsiveness is a commonly used valida tion method to test the psychometric properties of pain scales. It is based on the hypothesis that as pain is associated with many procedures e.g. needle related procedures, pain scores will increase in response to these stimuli. Conversely, if the procedu re is not painful scores would not be expected to rise. In studies where responsiveness has been tested the analysis has often involved comparison of the mean scores for the different phases of the procedure. However, this is a simplistic approa ch which do es not consider the effects of the child, the reviewer or repeated measures. Mixed linear modelling was used in this study to account for these factors in the analysis of the change in scores across the phases of the procedures. Validation of scale perfo rmance includes methods to demonstrate the capacity of the scale to differentiate between pai n and non -pain related distress . Traditionally, t -tests to establish a statistical differen ce between groups has been used. Taddio and colleagues used t his approac h analysis to examine the capacity of the MBPS to differentiate between two groups of infants receiving different immunisations (488) . The t-test was also used to analyse the MBPS data from our study for publicatio n and a statistically significant difference between the scores of infants and children undergoing painful versus non -painful procedures was shown . (464) . The t-test SECTION 5 273 measures whether a significant difference betwee n the means exists. The aim of validation is to determine whether a specific score can predict the group (painful versus non -pain procedure) that the infant or child belongs on the basis of their score. This is appropriately assessed using receiver operati ng characteristic (ROC) analysis to report sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (265) . The ROC analysis for the MBPS data in our study provided much more meaningful results than those generated using the t-test. This analysis confirm ed that the MBPS discriminated between painful an d non -painful procedures most accurately (sensit ivity 94% 0.84) cut -off score of 4. However , ROC analysis highlighted a substantial limitation in performance of the MBPS which was not made apparent by testing the differen ce in the means. Analysis of reliability data s hould use techniques designed to provide an estimate of absolute agreement (290) . The traditional approach to reliab ility data has been to a calculate correlation coefficient, e.g. Pearson's r and many of the studies examining reliability identified in the systematic reviews used this method of analysis. This method of ana lysis reports the extent of the association betw een observers' scores but does not provide a means to determining the level of absolute agreement between responses. In the prospective study, reported in Section 4, intra -class correlation coefficients were used to calculate intra - and inter -rater reliabi lity. Furthermore, Bland -Altman plots and statistics were used to assess intra -rater reliability. Both analysis techniques assess absolute agreement and are described in more detail in Chapter 2. They are recommended for analysis of reliability in preferen ce to traditional correlations such as Spearman's correlation (342, 521, 522) . We have previously acknowledged the trap in interpreting reliability as binary, e.g. as either 'reliable' or 'unreliable'. This is a simplistic interpretation and reliability is more correctly interpreted by degrees e.g. low, moderate and high levels of reliability. Therefore, it can be concluded that the retrospective and prospective reliability data for the VASobs confirms at best moderate levels of reliability for VASobs scores when the scale is used to assess proc edural pain. However, when used to assess distress much higher levels of reliability are achieved. This data infers that the VASobs pain score could be used to assess proce dural pain. However, the conventional view of psychometrics places reliability and validity on a hierarchy where for scores to be considered valid they must be reliable. Furthermore, if they are shown to be valid they are accepted as reliable. Quantitative ly, validity is a function of the reliability of the scores using the test of inter est and the reliability of the criterion against which it is compared. The relationship between these two properties is described mathematically by the equation reported in chapter 2. If this holds true, the concerns held about the reliability of the VASob s make it SECTION 5 274 difficult to accept the VASobs as valid for procedural pain assessment. However , it is undeniable that the results of validation testing for VASobs pain and VASobs distress were promising and perhaps should not be dismissed so readily. The comple xity of the construct of interest (pain) and the many factors influencing its assessment may make a framework such as the one described to explain the relationship between r eliability and validity too rigid for interpreting these results. Pain is a qualita tive rather than a quantitative experience and pain behaviours have been described as a system of communication designed to elicit a response (92). In this paradigm pain assessment is a function of the patient/clinician dyad and providing the patient elicits the response needed, the specifics of the assessment may be less important. Strengths and lim itations Procedural pain management has attracted considerable attention in the las t two decades, but this is the first focused project to use a series of steps to identify an observational pain scale adequately supported by psychometric data to recommend it for assessing pain experienced by infants and young children undergoing a diagno stic or therapeutic procedure. Previously published systematic reviews have included reviews of the psychometric properties of existing scales. However, there were limitatio ns to these reviews that were largely overcome by the design rigour of this project . A detailed interrogation of the literature preceded robust systematic reviews to summarise the psychometric properties of the scales identified as potentially suitable. Th ese reviews uniquely included a quality assessment of the included studies to provi de a strong foundation for the recommendations made based on the review results. In each case these recommendations included the need for new studies to assess the psychomet ric properties of the identified scales when used to assess procedures, which was t he final stage of this project. While a strength of this work, the search strategy and the criteria designed to assist in the identification of potentially suitable scales may also have been a weakness. The criteria used for this purpose were developed for this thesis and were based on several assumptions : that a scale designed explicitly for assessment of procedural pain was likely to perform well, that a scale psychometri cally tested for this purpose may be supported by data to this effect and that a scale that has been accepted by the clinical and resear ch community is also likely to perform well. In addition, the criteria used to define acceptance were based on logic rat her than an established convention, in particular the number of RCTs needed to confirm acceptance. It was thought that these criteria wo uld narrow a field of 65 scales to those best suited for purpose. However, it is also possible that these criteria resul ted in the exclusion of scales that although less well known, SECTION 5 275 less widely used or unsupported by data were better suited for procedural pain than those that were eligible based on the criteria set. The systematic reviews conducted in phase two and report ed in Section 3 of this thesis used a method based on the principles of the PRISMA Statement to ensure rigour (329) . Furthermore, the methods used to test the psychometric properties of the scales were assessed using quality assessment tools designed for this purpose (COSMIN Checkl ist (342) and the Jadad Scale (338) ). Anderson and colleagues . in a recent systematic review highlighted how infrequent quality assessment of the eligible studies is included in the methods for pain scale related reviews. However, there were limitations, which have been reported in Chapters 5 to 7, and they included the effects of a potential publication bias based on the inclusion of only published studies. Studie s published in languages other than English were excluded as t he contribution that evaluation of a translated version of the scale might make on the English version is unclear. Similarly, data from studies focused on adults may potentially make a contribut ion to our understanding of the application of pain scales. Ho wever, as psychometric properties are associated with the scores (e.g. the circumstances to which the scale is applied) these sources of data were excluded. Despite these limitations, these revi ews made a unique contribution to the literature regarding the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs and provided a platform for recommendations regarding their role in procedural pain assessment. The prospective study in this project was designed to over come many of the limitations of the methods used in studies in cluded in the systematic reviews by using multiple validation methods, large sample sizes, unique reviewers across phases of the procedure for the same child and appropriate analysis methods. Th e COSMIN checklist was originally developed to assess methods quality (342) . However , the authors have acknowledged a role for the Checklist when designing a psychometric evaluation study and it was used to inform the protocol for the prospective study, which was reproduced in Chapter 8 (468) . Furthermore, statisti cians were consulted during planning to assist the development of an appropriate analysis plan. Nonetheless there were several limitations to the prospective psychometric evaluation study. The u se of video recordings allowed multiple assessments of the sam e infant or child under controlled circumstances where reviewers were uninterrupted . This is a common strategy used by pain researchers aiming to test reliability and validity (246, 334, 448, 474, 488, 523 -529). However, as real time, real world application may impact on a clinician's app lication of the scale, recommendations made based on video - based data collection should be applied cautiously to clinic al practice. Furthermore, reviewers scored a large number of videos on a single occasion providing opportunity to practice and compare application across different segments. This may have result ed in relatively higher SECTION 5 276 reliability estimates than those that might have be en achieved if scoring was c ompleted in real- time clinical practice. A large cohort of clinicians responsible for paediatric procedural pain assessment was recruited to ensure that the results reflected the performance of the scale when used by clinician s and not by researchers trained to use the scale to improve the reliability of scores. However, this cohort was recruited from a single centre, where clinicians may be socialised to approach pain and pain assessment in a particular way. This also makes it important that this is considered before generalising to other clinicians. Clinician reviewers could not be blinded to the circumstances experienced by the infant or child, which may have impacted on their judgement in ways that have been des cribed earlie r. Attempts to limit the impact of this were made by preventing reviewers from assessing more than one segment of the procedure from the same child. This was to prevent reviewers from creating patterns in their assessments to reflect a predict able pattern in scores across a procedure. However, this does not reflect the circumstances under which these scales are used clinically where clinicians assessing pain are not blinded to the procedure or denied the opportunity to see patterns in behaviour s across phas es of the procedure. Given the complexity of the pain experience and the potential for variability in individual responses it is possible that the change in behaviour rather than the raw score provides the best measure of the infant or child's pain experie nce. This is similar to the approach that has been taken by experts exploring the best ways to assess pain in infants and children with cognitive impairment (222, 223, 225) . Scales , such as the FLACC s cale, are tailored to include individualised responses that allow for the patterns of behaviour seen in individuals which are thought to be their unique pain related behaviours. The use of clinician reports of the clinical utility of the FLACC scale, MBP S and VASobs is a limitation of the prospective study. Testing of clinical utility is best achieved by assessing the impact of scale use on the clinical decisions made as clinician reported behaviours may not accurately reflect the decisions an d behaviours demon strated clinically. Therefore, the results can only be considered an estimate of utility (277) . Recommendations and future directions Recommendations regarding FLACC scale, MBP S and VASobs use for clinical and research purposes can be made based on the results of this project. Furthermore, the results highlighted remaining gaps in our understanding of the performance of these scales used to assess procedural pain experienced by infant s and young children. These gaps serve as the basis for SECTION 5 277 recommendations for future research. Finally, knowledge translation and implementation of these results and the ensuing recommendations is briefly addressed. Clinical and research use The FLACC scale is supported by the most convincing evidence to support recommending it for clinical and research use. However, the practical shortcomings of the FLACC scale used to assess procedural pain need to be acknowledged. Restraint, the absence of attempts to con sole and the procedure itself all have the potential to interfere with the allocation of a FLACC score. The relative ease with which the VASobs is applied may in part explain its frequent use. However , the reliability of scores in this study prevent recomm ending this scale for use. The MBPS also cannot be recommended for procedural pain as the results call into question the capacity of the scale to adequately differentiate pain from non -pain related distress and to differentiate pain and non -pain related di stress and from a neutral state. Although, the FLACC scale is reliable and sensitive to pain, there is data to suggest that it is not as specific. Based on these results it must be assumed that the scale measures pain AND to some extent non -pain re lated distress. Scores should be considered indicative of a composite of experiences and clinical decisions regarding treatment should reflect a multidimensional experience. This shift has largely occurred in clinical practice where approaches to managemen t have acknowledged the need for distress management to address pain, fear and anxiety. This includes non -pharmacological strategies to alleviate distress (484) and in the last two decades recommendations for sedat ion to assist with management of fear and anxiety (15, 519, 530 -532). A similar shift may be needed for study designs as many of the RCTs identified in the review s were designed to test the efficacy of an analges ic or local anaesthetic . This approach to the question and research design is reliant on use of a scale with high levels of sensitivity and specificity for procedural pain. In the absence of a scale that can make this distinction it is possible that the ef ficacy of the analgesic or anaesthetic agent might be masked by overwhelming non - pain related distress associated with the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. A trial conducted to test the efficacy of nebulised lignocaine to reduce the pain associated wi th nasogastric tube insertion in infants and young children may be an example of a study where the results were compromised by the capacity to distinguish between pain and non -pain related distress (351) . Despite e vidence of the effectiveness of this strategy for minimising the pain associated with this procedure in adults (533-535), Babl a nd colleagues could not demonstrate a difference between the lignocaine and placebo gr oup based on their FLACC scores . There are potentially equally SECTION 5 278 plausible alternative explanations for these results . However, the results of this RCT in light of adult da ta, give reason for concern about the capacity of this scale used to distinguish betwe en pain and non -pain related distress. One approach to this challenge is to consider the distinction between pain and non -pain related distress unwarranted and trials d esigned to assess the efficacy of an analgesic or anaesthetic, unnecessary. This would require a paradigm shift in approach to research design that acknowledge s the duality of the procedural experience (pain and non -pain related distress) and would result in trials designed to test the efficacy of management regimens aimed at treating proce dural distress concurrently rather than regimens designed to solely treat pain. This approach aligns with clinical practice recommendations that acknowledges pain as well as non-pain related distress and advocate for a composite of strategies such as analg esics and local anaesthetics and sedation and other non -pharmacological measures aimed at alleviating distress . Future research Gaps remain in our understanding of the assessment of the experience of infants and children; some reflect areas that were not explored by this project and some that have been revealed as a result of this work. These gaps underlie the recomm endations described in this section. Furthermore, limitations to the methods used also contribute to recommendations for additional research in this area. Before commencing new studies to address these gaps , the capacity to answer other questions based on the existing dataset should be explored. Relationships between variables and direct comparison between reviewer responses not analysed as pa rt of this thesis may increase our understanding of the potential influences on the psychometrics properties of the studied scales. For example ; comparing responses where the clinician indicated that they were unable to score an item with those of the other reviewers to determine how often reviewers disagreed about the capacity to score items may point to the influence of clinician judgement when allocating scores. Additional analysis could also include analysis intended to provide us with increased underst anding of the methods used to test the psychometrics properties e.g. to examine order effects base d on which scale was applied by the reviewers first. Confirmation of the clinical utility of a tool is key to accepting it for use and in the prospective study this was a clinician reported assessment of utility . Future research should aim to test application of the scale in the clinical environment to provide opportunity to test the impact of the SECTION 5 279 pain scores on clinical decisions to provide an estimate of cl inical utility (277) . It is widely believed that self -reported behaviours are not a reliable proxy measure of clinical behaviour, although a systematic review testing the relationship between self -reported behaviour and clinical behaviour concluded that the evidence was incon clusive as to its reliability as proxy measure (536) . Nonetheless, sufficient criticism exists to warrant testing of clinical behaviours rather than the reported intensions or impressions of clinici ans (277) . Furthermore, this approach to testing the application of the scale will more cl osely approximate its performance in clinical practice than application of the scales to vide o recordings of the procedures. In the clinical environment procedures and clinician assessments may be potentially affected by parental involvement, clinical info rmation, other clinicians, available resources, clinician relationships with the infant or ch ild and their parents, competing priories and other incidental factors such as clinical interruptions (537). Furthermore, the exploration of clinical utility of pain scores will provide an opportunity to better understand the clinical significance of the differences in scores across individual s and the change in scores over time within individuals . Psychometric testing of a scale provides data to support the reliability and validity of the scores rather than the scale per se as the scores are a function of the per formance of the scale applied in the circumstances under which it was tested (269) . As has been articulated earlier these circumstances include patient related factors, e.g. their age, gender, tempera ment, past experienc e, culture : clinician related factors, e.g. their discipline, specialty, experience, edu cation , personal demographics such as age, gender and culture and procedure related factors, although these are less well understood. As this was completed in a single centre in the emergency department similar studies should be repeated in other departmen ts, other organisations and using a range of procedures to explore further the potential impact of the reviewer on application of the scales and therefore the psychomet ric properties of the scores . Increasing evidence of the reliability and validity of sco res in a range of circumstances add to our confidence that the scale can be reliably and validly used to measure procedural pain in circumstances that approximate those in which it has been tested. Confirming the capacity of the scales capacity to differ entiate between pain and non -pain related distress is crucial to understanding the ways in which the scale can be used and the impact on clinical and research applicati on of these scales based on current data has already been described. However, although t his study has made a significant contribution to this question it is insufficient to be considered conclusive. The conduct of similar studies to this one to address the need for data generated under different circumstances is also an opportunity to include methods aimed at testing specificity. SECTION 5 280 Several concerns regarding the design of the FLACC scale and the MBPS were revealed by the assessment of the feasibility of app lication of these scales and closer inspection of the scores. Although it is tempting to suggest that all efforts should concentrate on revision of the FLACC scale given the results of the psychometric analysis, the potential value of revision of the MBPS should not be ignored. The ways in which both scales might be revised and the rationale for these potential changes has been discussed more extensively earlier but in summary the MBPS scale descriptors for face and cry items might benefit from inclusion of more neutral expressions and revision of the FLACC scale face item descriptors and revi ew of the legs, activity and consolability items to improve this scale for procedural use should be considered. Revisions must be made based on empirical data and the i nternal consistency of the items of revised versions tested before the scale is subjecte d to closer scrutiny. A revised scale would require psychometric and feasibility testing before it could be recommended for clinical or research use . Careful attention to the design of studies and data analysis strategies is required for any studies exami ning the psychometric properties of the existing scales or revised versions to ensure methodological rigour. For future studies we recommend using the COSMIN Checklist as a template for the design. The quality of methods used in many studies was variable w ith many studies using methods rated on the COSMIN checklist as 'poor' and 'fair' (342) . Finally, careful consideration should be given to undertaking work to identify behaviours consistently demonstrated by infants and young children in response to procedural pain to expand this evidence base . The results of this work may be used to support the revision of existing scales or to inform the development of new empirically derived procedural pain scale. Dissemination and knowledge translation Critical to research is consideration for how the fin dings are disseminated to ensure that they impact on practice . The results of the search for a potentially suitable pain scale highlight a conflict between available evidence and practice (538) . The psychometric properties of the VASobs were summarised in a review in 2002 which concluded that there was insufficient data to recommend th e scale for use. In 2007 von Baeyer and Spag rud's review recommended the FLACC scale and CHEOPS for procedural pain assessment and there was no mention of the VASobs as a potential option (30). Despite these publications, the VASobs was used almost three times as often as the next most frequently used scale (FLACC scale) amongst the RCTs identified. This t rend seems to have reversed in the years sin ce this search was completed. SECTION 5 281 The decision to complete this thesis with publication was aimed at ensuring dissemination of the results of this work to the pain community. The results of the systematic reviews a nd the psychometric evaluation studies have been published in leading journals for the discipline and specialty : Pain, The Journal of Pain and Journal of Pediatric Nursing (332, 464, 469, 539) . Furthermor e, the pro tocol was published to provide a potential template for other researchers (468) . Additionally, opportunities to present these results at international, national and local conferences and seminars have been sought. It should also be noted that there are plans to publish unpublished data from the thesis and any additional analysis that is completed . These are the traditional approaches to dissemination but in recen t years it has been shown that there are considerable delays to achieving practice change in response to evidence and it has been suggested that traditional methods are insufficient to drive practice change (540) . This may be more likely to come from changes to pain related guidelines and recommendations made on the basis of new evidence (541) . Use of the evidence to inform education programs aimed at clinicians responsible for assessing and managing procedural pain may also generate change in practice (542) . There is a g rowing body of paediatric pain related work based on the principles of knowledge translation and implementation science and ChildKind International (543) leads much of this work (538) . A systematic review of knowledge translation studies identified 60 studies that tested a knowledge translation strategy aimed at paediatric pain (538) . Three quarters of the studies tested practice -level changes, which included changes to pain assessment procedures . Although many o f these initiatives were geared towards increasing the frequency of assessments or docu mentation of pain scores, some focused on implementing a new assessment protocol. All studies demonstrated a positive change as a result of initiatives that included in -service and workshop training and resource intensive activities such as auditing and re porting of assessment practices, visual reminders in clinical areas and changes in forms and charts. On completion of this project and dissemination of the results via t raditional channels, strategies to ensure that these results inform knowledge translati on initiatives is vital. This may include local level guideline changes which is likely to have both local, national and international impact as th e study hospital produ ces and published clinical practice guideline that are internatio nally accessed. Furthe rmore, the study hospital (The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne) is a member of a an Australian and New Zealand paediatric emergency research network (PREDICT (544) ) which provides another vehicle for dissemination and collaboration , nationally and internationally . SECTION 5 282 Conclusion This project was a robust attempt to identify an observational scale that could be recommended as suitable to assess procedural pain experienced by infants and young children. Of the many uniqu e paediatric observational pain scales identified in the litera ture (480) very few were either designed for procedural pain assessment use, supported by psychometric evaluation data or universally accepted for this purpose. Three scales met pre -established criteria an d were considered potentially suitable: the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs. Following systematic reviews of the available psychometric data for these scales it was concluded that these scales coul d not be recommended on the basis of the existing data . The results of the prospective study to examine the psychometric properties of the FLACC scale, the MBPS and the VASobs pain and the VASobs distress, confirmed the FLACC scale as the scale supported b y the most convincing data. However, significant conce rns regarding this scale's performance remained: namely the feasibility of applying this scale for medical procedures and the specificity of the scores for pain. The circumstances of a procedure create a potentially unique experience for infants and childr en that impact on their behavioural responses. It seems likely that observational scales, including the FLACC scale, measure a composite of pain and non -pain related distressed and should be considered distress rather than pain scales and that this should be considered when using these scales for clinical or research purposes and for interpreting scores. There are also still considerable gaps in our understanding of pain assessment, specifically for infants and children undergoing diagnostic and therapeuti c procedures. If we are to base treatment decisions and interpret research on assessments generated using these scales it is critical that these gaps are explored. It is vital that clinicians and resear chers understand what the scale measures and the facto rs that influence these measurements. Scale revisions may make these scales better suited for procedural pain assessment. However, revised versions would again require extensive psychometric testing bef ore they could be recommended for use. 283 REFERENCES 1.

At second injection 2months later MBPS (7.8 v 8.3, p=0.002) and observer NRS scores (4.7 v 5.5, p=0.002) were lower in intervention group. No difference in parent NRS or cry . Jadad score = 3. Taddio et al, 2015 (467) Randomised double blind controlled trial . To compare the analgesic effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine to sucrose solution for reducing pain fr om vaccine injections in infants . 120 infants aged 2 - 4 months . Exc: infants with impaired neurological development, history of seizures or opioids in las t 24hours . Pain: procedural (immunisation). Setting: - participants randomised to: Grp 1 - rotavirus vaccine 1.5 mL orally 2 min prior to vaccine injections, then sucrose 24% solution 2 mL orally 1 min foll owing vaccine injections Grp 2 - sucrose orally 2 min prior to vaccine injections then rotavirus vaccine 1 min following vaccine injections . Pain scoring: MBPS, parent and clinician NRS, cry duration. No difference in MBPS scores, NRS or cry duration betw een groups at baseline or during injections . Baseline MBPS scores 3.0 and 2.7, NRS parent 0.2 a nd 0.1 and NRS clinician 0.3 and 0.1 . Jadad score = 5 .
