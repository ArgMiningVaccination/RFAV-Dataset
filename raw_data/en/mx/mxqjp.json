How do we feel about it? What do we consider as our options? Who do we go to? If anything I just want to instill a bit of hope that you can take charge of the journey and weight up your options, follow your intuition, seek advice and support from many excellent therapists and doctors. Build up a team so to speak! You have options from: - Medical doctors and consultants. - Nutritional therapists. - Functional or integrative therapists. - Medical herbalists - Manual therapists such as osteopathic and chiropractic and Bowen therapy experts. - Reflexology, acupuncture, aromatherapy, sound therapy, homeopathy, tree and flower therapy ( [something close to my own heart](https://souls-whispers.com/)). - Energy healing modalities from technologies such as PEMF or from hands on therapists practicing energy healing. Etc. I do recommend when possible to work with someone with a medical or science background so that they can understand both sides of the great divide that we know as holistic and conventional. A pretty crazy divide if you ask me as there are merits to all approaches and additional benefits from approaching your illness or diagnosis with a 'team' approach. Seek what feels right. Although I do recommend that you give any therapy and therapist sufficient time, there is nothing 'wrong' with seeking multiple answers. Build allies on your journey I always suggest that you blend physical and healing treatments with mindfulness, self-awareness and acknowledgement of emotions. Something I use often in my clinic is a TIME-LINE and clients find this very insightful to make a road map of factors that came before an illness or diagnosis. Never quit on the journey forwards; the body given the right tools, love and support will always strive to heal. Much love, Andrea PS you may find "}
