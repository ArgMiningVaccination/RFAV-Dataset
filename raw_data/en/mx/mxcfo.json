We turn to food to strengthen our bodies and minds, but it wasn't until I realized its ability to elevate us on an spiritual level that I felt I was truly thriving. I've noticed both in myself and in clients, when I eat a certain food, my overall sense of connectedness to the world around me is elevated. This is more than just learning how to eat healthy. It's learning what foods fill that deep place and make you feel more connected. In learning how to eat this way, I've seen people become happier, healthier, and better able to connect to a higher level of consciousness. These are some of the foods I've found that enhance spirituality, blur the line between food and medicine and will get you on a path towards feeding your soul! Leafy Greens One of the best ways to get closer to \"source\", however you define it, is to indulge in leafy greens straight from the ground. I always think of leafy greens as the closest we can get to eating our actual energy source: the sun. Plants are able to directly take in and transform the magnificent power that is the giant fireball in our sky. They convert that energy into something that we can then eat and absorb. I mean, how cool is that?! Ok, I'll admit I'm a bit of a nerd but if you're looking to get the highest vibrational foods, look no further than leafy greens. It's no coincidence that shamanistic diets involve high plant volume specific to leafy greens! The best way to consume them without stressing your digestive system is either lightly cooked or juiced. Chlorella Chlorella is an awesome superfood and it's included in this list for its many cleansing properties. I truly feel there is a parallel between spiritual and physical cleansing. By ridding yourself of toxic chemicals, your freeing your body and your brain to be wholly present and alive. Chlorella helps detox by binding to heavy metals and other toxic substances and helps to eliminate them from the body. The less bogged down your system is, the easier it is to keep a calm and centered mind. Sprouts The thing that always amazes me about sprouts is that they're such tiny power houses of nutrients. The nutrients required to sprout something are often concentrated. This means that instead of eating a whole head of broccoli, you can nosh on a handful of sprouts and get the same effect without the digestive stress. They're high in vitamins and minerals and they're more \"alive\" when you eat them than your standard full grown veggie. This gives them a bit more of an edge when it comes to keeping you at the highest vibration. A few of my favorite sprouts: broccoli, pea, radish and alfalfa. Cacao I've talked a bit about the ability of dark chocolate to ease the system. If you've ever indulged in chocolate, chances are, you know exactly what I mean. Cacao in particular has a grounding yet energizing feel to it. It perks you up without wiring you out. If you can get your hands on whole roasted cacao bean, that's the best way to experience the spiritual enhancement of this magical fruit. Rich in polyphenols and minerals content, they are an incredibly supportive medicinal food. I'll often keep a few in my purse to nibble on when I need a pick me up. Holy Basil If you've been reading my blog posts, you know I'm pretty obsessed with Holy Basil. It's not so much a food but an herb, though it can be used in culinary dishes. Holy Basil is a calming and centering adaptogen that helps you feel at ease when faced with stress. The best description I've heard is that it's like yoga in a cup. For the days you don't have time to hit the mat, it can be a lifesaver. Adaptogens like holy basil have a unique way of rebalancing your body's fight or flight mechanism so that you aren't operating in a constantly stressed state. There's no better way to reach peak spiritual performance than to disengage your body from stress. Walnuts Folk medicine likes to connect a food's shape to its beneficial properties. For centuries the walnut has been thought to feed the brain because of its brain-like shape. Turns out, there's some science to back this up. Walnuts are a great source of brain supporting fatty acids, proteins, minerals that boost the nervous system. Brain and nervous system health is key to maintaining an enlightened sense of spirituality. There's something uniquely grounding I find when eating walnuts. Angelica (Archangelica) Angelica is one of my personal plant spirit guides of late. It started after I kept finding it EVERYWHERE! From reading about it in books to finding it on hikes, it felt like angelica was stalking me. I truly feel that by connecting more deeply to plants, we're able to enhance our spiritual balance. I did a little research and it turns out Angelica has been touted for its protective properties, both physiological and spiritual, for centuries. The stalks of the plant are edible and compare to the texture of celery. They can be used in soups, salads, or stir fry dishes. The candied root is sometimes used in baked goods. It's high in minerals and vitamin C and is also healing for the digestive system. You can also take this in tea or tincture form for the same elevating benefits. Whatever you believe in, or don't believe in, there is no doubt that food connects us. As you spring into this new year, take the time to notice what your food is connecting you to.
