But, in fact, regular exercise will make you feel less tired in the long run, so you'll have more energy. Even a single 15-minute walk can give you an energy boost, and the benefits increase with more frequent physical activity. Start with a small amount of exercise. Build it up gradually over weeks and months until you reach the recommended goal of 2 hours 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as cycling or fast walking, every week.

Talking therapy beats fatigue There's some evidence that talking therapies such as [counselling](/conditions/counselling/) or [cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)](/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/) might help to fight fatigue, or tiredness caused by stress, anxiety or low mood. See a GP for a referral for talking treatment on the NHS, or for advice on seeing a private therapist. Cut out caffeine The Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends that anyone feeling tired should cut out caffeine. It says the best way to do this is to gradually stop having all caffeine drinks over a 3-week period. Caffeine is found in: - coffee - tea - cola - energy drinks - some painkillers and herbal remedies Try to stay off caffeine completely for a month to see if you feel less tired without it. You may find that not consuming caffeine gives you headaches. If this happens, cut down more slowly on the amount of caffeine that you drink. Drink less alcohol Although a couple of glasses of wine in the evening can help you fall asleep, you sleep less deeply after drinking alcohol. The next day you'll be tired, even if you sleep a full 8 hours. Cut down on alcohol before bedtime. You'll get a better night's rest and have more energy. The NHS recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week, which is equivalent to 6 pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine. Try to have several alcohol-free days each week. Read more about how to [cut down on alcohol](/live-well/alcohol-advice/tips-on-cutting-down-alcohol/). Drink more water for better energy Sometimes you feel tired simply because you're mildly dehydrated. A glass of water will do the trick, especially after exercise. Read "}
