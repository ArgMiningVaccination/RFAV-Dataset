He uses his witchcraft and contacts to do spells on demand, as well as help people with various other issues of the supernatural persuasion. This is very occasionally for money (usually in the case of wealthier clients) but most often he'll do it for a nondescript favour (which you'll be bound to) that can be called in at any time. He was born in 339BC, in a village called \u00c5kegthveit in what is now Sweden during the early [Iron Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age), and grew up believing, in his early years, he was just a normal human boy. However, Ledan is the son of the archangel [Jophiel](/wiki/Jophiel) (who died when Ledan was just two) and a powerful witch he fell in love with called [Thyrv\u00ef](/wiki/Thyrv%C3%AF); making him very much not. He believed this because his powers have manifested slowly and steadily over centuries, and even when they did, in the beginning they were relatively harmless, with him moving objects with his mind or turning his mother's hair blue. Ledan aged like any other boy, and it was only as an adult he started to come into his more potent powers, only gaining the ability to [heal himself](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Regeneration) at the age of around 32, which it slowly became also caused him to stop ageing entirely. He'd lived a fairly average life as the village's healer, married a human woman called [\u00c1sta](/wiki/%C3%81sta), with whom had several children; [Cenr\u00edkr](/wiki/Cenr%C3%ADkr), [\u00c6lfr\u00edkr](/wiki/Ledan/Relationships#%C3%86lfr%C3%ADkr), [Sigr\u00ed\u00f0r](/wiki/Ledan/Relationships#Sigr%C3%AD%C3%B0r), [M\u00e6r](/wiki/M%C3%A6r) and [R\u00fani](/wiki/Ledan/Relationships#R%C3%BAni), only two of whom reached the at which they also stopped ageing or their ageing slowed, and had several children of their own, Leda's grandchildren. As a type being not created by god he is considered by most angels and other beings to be an abomination, and given the fact that nephilim have been revealed to be at least a potential threat to God himself if powerful enough, are considered highly dangerous ones, and thus are hunted. This was true for Leda for the majority of his life, as such, he limits how often he uses his powers to avoid drawing attention to himself, instead relying on the witchraft his mother taught him as well as the many spells he developed himself. Due to his mix of [Archangel ](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Archangel) and [Human](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Human) he is probably at least on his way to being as powerful as an archangel, but is still (even after over 2,300 years) in the stage of developing his powers fully. Ledan 'recovered' from a [hex](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/hex) that was placed on him by a former colleague called [Myrrine](/wiki/Myrrine) several years ago, while it was intended to kill him outright, his angelic side made the hex behave strangely. he was only able to use a limited amount of power at a time; causing him to become weakened after prolonged use of his angelic powers, with it also weakening him generally over time, presumably as his angelic side was all that was actually keeping him alive. This did not seemingly affect his ability to cast spells, however, since this is something humans are simply able to do without requiring angelic grace. The hex eventually caused Leda to get weaker and weaker to the point of delirium before he eventually started continually dying, with his powers regenerating him over a few hours, only to deplete again shortly. This led to Ledan's mother deciding (without asking him) to kill him with his [father's archangel blade](/wiki/Jophiel%27s_Archangel_Blade) in order to properly bring him back, with the hex being broken, as it had finally fully done its job. However, a life can't usually be resurrected without another in return and thus [Thyrv\u00ef](/wiki/Thyrv%C3%AF) died as a result of the spell, completely devastating Ledan. Ledan has six cats, all of whom he adores. While he's a been a vegetarian for several decades, though he obviously was not always (due to the fact it would almost impossible before), he is both good at and enjoys cooking. It's suggested his high skill in cooking could be partly due to it requiring similar skills to magic, which he also, as well as excelling at, very clearly enjoys or at least takes pride in. He appears to be quite sentimental, as he keeps things he likes or treasures from time to time; meaning that at this point he has what could be described as a mini-museum of ancient/antique, but mostly otherwise valueless, items in his attic and basement of his home in Fleetwood, Vermont. Most notably, he has kept various vintage cars and motorbikes, which he enjoys keeping in as perfect order as possible. Leda has [his father's](/wiki/Jophiel%27s_Archangel_Blade) [archangel blade](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Archangel_Blades), which was given to him when he was just seven, as both an heirloom of sorts and a way to defend himself from angels. He rarely entrusts it or its location to anyone, as he'll only let someone who he trusts completely and absolutely anywhere near the thing (understandably), as it's the only thing which can kill him (easily anyway), as well as it being sentimentally valuable to him. Biography[ ] Early Life[ ] Li\u00f0an (Elder Futhark: ) was born with the L\u00edfa to [Thyrv\u00ef](/wiki/Thyrv%C3%AF) (a [witch](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/witch)) and [Jophiel](/wiki/Jophiel) (an [archangel](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/archangel)) in the village of \u00c5kegthveit on the 28th October in (worked out by its closeness to the festival of Vetrn\u00e6tr [[7]](#cite_note-7) [[8]](#cite_note-8), a festival of three days that celebrated the end of summer, the start of winter) 339BC. Though, as a result of his archangel father, he was an \" [archnephilim](/wiki/Archnephilim_(Grace%27s_lore))\", he was raised as if he were a normal child, with his true nature kept from him. This was made particularly possible by the fact that, unfortunately, his father was killed when he was two, and he never got to know the man. To Ledan growing up, [Jophiel](/wiki/Jophiel) was just the absent father who had died when he was very young. She was also aided by the fact that they lived a somewhat isolated existence. Despite Thyrv\u00ef's protests, however, Ledan's uncle [\"Loki\"](/wiki/Gabriel_(TheSnailQueen)) (i.e. Gabriel) insisted on playing an active role in the young child's life. Though he was certainly a positive figure in Ledan's life, being the Ledan's only father figure other than his grandfather Agnarr. Loki doted on his nephew, who soon treated him as his father, a sentiment he also returned. Thyrv\u00ef however, was not a fan of this development. She didn't want an influence she couldn't control shaping her son's life. Thus she insisted that Loki not reveal his true identity to Leda, or reveal that Leda was not a normal \"girl\" until she was ready to tell him. Loki used to call Leda V\u00e1li, a cutesy nickname he meant to mean \"little Valkyrie\". Though Thryv\u00ef disliked this, from a very young age \"L\u00edfa\" wanted to be seen as a boy, something Loki supported the idea of, and Ledan's grandparents Nefr\u00edn and Agnarr equally \"encouraged\" the idea (both having spent a lot of time in the fae realm, whose ideas on gender were far more lax than those of Ledan's contemporaries), seeing no problem with it. Loki \"encouraged\" Thryv\u00ef to \"deal with it\", which left Thyrv\u00ef with little choice but to accept her son's identity, to grasp onto some control over the situation, she suggested her son use the name Li\u00f0an, which he agreed to. From then on, Leda passed in society as a boy, something the other villagers had been enchanted to remember as always being the case. Leda's powers didn't start to show for a long while either, in his early years he appeared just like any other child, with his grandfather Agnarr. He was taught like any other child how to fight with swords, bows, knives, the like and, from a very young age, he begun to help his mother with her work, despite the fact that magic was considered a feminine practice by the society of then [[9]](#cite_note-9) [[10]](#cite_note-10) [[11]](#cite_note-11) Ledan thought this was silly, and wanted to learn anyway despite how dysphoric any taunts about it made him. Magic was cool, and it was his craft. Leda's desire to learn his mother's craft made her relax more about his identity, having always wanted to raise her child, her son, to learn her craft, him still wanting to learn made her realise that she would still get to do this. At the time, his mother used her magic to act as the village's healer, though her magic could obviously go far beyond this, all the while Leda was taught the reins of his mother's craft. Leda already showed extreme promise in the magic department, possibly due to him being a nephilim, steadily learning all he needed to act as a somewhat of an assistant by the age of seven. Ledan still had no idea what he was, and how powerful he was likely to become, and that was precisely the way Thyrv\u00ef wanted it until she saw fit to reveal it. His involvement in his mothers \"business\" made him somewhat of an outcast, as the kids his age all either helped their parents with farming or hunting or other such similar and more mundane occupations. That, and his mother was considered to be somewhat crazy by the village as a whole, who were sceptical about her knack from healing coming from actual magic as most believed all it was old wives tales and superstition taken to extremes even then. Only the gods could really perform feats of magic, right? Little did they know about any real connection the family had to the gods of [Asgard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgard). Ledan also had earned the social stigma attached to boys and men learning sei\u00f0r. This was offset, even if only slightly, by helping his grandfather (Agnarr) with his work as the village blacksmith. As a blacksmith Ledan's grandfather had a fair amount more prestige, due to the blades he made being of fine quality, [[12]](#cite_note-12) though he was by no means rich, he was talented. It was because of Agnarr's profession Ledan and his mother even possessed a decent sword, let alone more than one. Since, generally speaking, they were not that well off. However, Ledan's grandfather doted on him and often gifted him what he could, which naturally was usually swords. This spurred the young boy's interest in them. Manifesting His Powers[ ] Ledan first began to come into his powers at around age seven, where he found himself able to move small objects with his mind as well as move or affect larger ones when he was angry or scared (usually breaking/destroying them). He kept this a secret from Thyrv\u00ef for as long as he could, as he believed she, even as a witch, would think he was some kind of monster. However, when Thyrv\u00ef found out about his powers, after an argument they had, during which his powers made themselves known, she explained to him that his father had not been human; though she didn't tell him exactly what or who he was until far later. She told him what he could understand instead, that his father had been Narfi, son of Loki, which was who his \"pa\u00f0i\" was. Leda couldn't help but feel extremely angry with his mother for keeping this from him, and letting him think that he was even more strange and alone than he already felt, or that she was going to hate him when she found out about his powers or perhaps even worse. The fact that she actually knew all along this was probably going to happen to him felt like a betrayal, because Leda thought she should have been there to reassure him, then again that was never his mother's way, was it? He initially felt angry with [Loki](/wiki/Gabriel_(TheSnailQueen)) too, until he explained that he would not have been able to play a part in his life unless he agreed to his mother's terms, which included not explaining this to him. A little boy who loved his pa\u00f0i, he accepted this, though his anger at his mother remained as she was the one who decided to keep him in the dark, she'd also been the one to decide that he should live the way she wanted, he couldn't help but feel boxed in by her in many ways. She wanted the child she imagined, not the child he was. Not that, at his age, he knew how to express this. Ledan saw all of it as a massive betrayal on Thyrv\u00ef's part, if he'd known he wouldn't have been as scared. He wouldn't have thought himself such a monster. Weirder than he already felt. However, as his mother continued to help him hide his powers from the rest of the residents of the village, he convinced himself that she had only been trying to help him in some way and slowly got over these feelings of resentment, valuing his close relationship with Thyrv\u00ef even then. She was his mother and she had only wanted to protect him, he decided. He was a monster in some ways, and if they knew what he was his friends would hate him. He continued to steadily develop his powers over the years with his mother and Loki's help, taking advantage of the fact he and Thyrv\u00ef lived relatively far outside of the main village and were already somewhat outcast, due to her profession to hide them from the other villagers. He slowly learnt how to control his powers more so they didn't flare up when he was in a bad mood or emotional from practice, this took a lot of work, but Loki impressed on him that it was extremely important. He learnt how to use them more effectively, and slowly but steadily Ledan began to get more and more powerful by the day. However, further rumours about him spread, and the fact he had come to live in such solitude had made his social standing that much worse, but also made it easier for him to pass as both male and as a \"normal human boy\". He was considered \"strange\" by most of his same-age peers, most of whom avoided him like the plague because of it. His only actual friends as a child were [\u00c1sta](/wiki/%C3%81sta), her brother Abj\u00f6rn, whose mother had been healed from a fever by Leda's mother and had been friends with her ever since as she attempted to learn the craft too, and another boy called Folke whose mother was also friends with Thyrv\u00ef. The four often played in the forests near and around the village together. He accidentally used his powers during a play fight in the forest at one point, which led to him telling them the truth about his parentage having to ask his friends to keep his secret. This led to the four of them sharing many secrets together, most children finding it just awesome that their friend was descended from the gods, Ledan said it wasn't exactly like that. \u00c1sta and Abj\u00f6rn told Ledan and Folke all about their mother and her budding craft, Folke told them he suspected his mother was \"of the [\u00c4lva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_folklore#Others)\". Despite the fact his mother had told him it was a bad idea to tell anyone, in light of this sharing mood the young boy also told his friends that he was trans (using the best terminology he had to describe it). The four children guarded each others' secrets closely. Loki's Punishment and Odin's Lie[ ] During his teen years. Adulthood[ ] [[13]](#cite_note-13) [[14]](#cite_note-14) By the age of around 15, Ledan was considered and treated as a full adult, having been treated as a small adult all of his 'childhood' anyway by the wider society. [[15]](#cite_note-15). It was at this stage in the friends' lives Folke was killed in a raid defending the village, though he was a hero, Folke's death hit him, \u00c1sta and Abj\u00f6rn hard. He later fell in love with and married his childhood friend [\u00c1sta](/wiki/%C3%81sta), with whom he travelled to a few villages over to start his own version of his mother's business, where someone was needed to heal the sick. Given he had already told her that he was trans (and thus was unable to biologically father children) when they were children, the question of how they would start a family arose. The couple decided that the only person they could trust to help them with this was Abj\u00f6rn, meaning that Ledan would be the one to carry and give birth to the children, not something he was thrilled about but he believed it wouldn't be too dysphoric for him, and he wanted to be a father. During the time that their first child was on the way the pair kept a low-profile for the later months, having a few things they would struggle to explain, but they knew once he was born that the villagers would have no reason not to simply assume \u00c1sta had given birth to him. The two had their first son, [Cenr\u00edkr](/wiki/Cenr%C3%ADkr), when Ledan was 18 and \u00c1sta was around 20 their second, [\u00c6lfr\u00edkr](/wiki/Ledan/Relationships#.C3.86lfr.C3.ADkr), two years later as well as several other children; [Sigr\u00ed\u00f0r](/wiki/Ledan/Relationships#Sigr.C3.AD.C3.B0r), [M\u00e6r](/wiki/M%C3%A6r) and [R\u00fani](/wiki/Ledan/Relationships#R.C3.BAni) over the years. In their new village Leda managed to gain the respect he lacked in their home village, despite the stigma that was still very much attached to the practice of magic for men, possibly due to his relatively personable nature, as well as the fact it was clear the magic he practised was clearly not simply 'old wives tales' and superstition as many people and witnessed it working for themselves. Leda continued to develop his powers from his father's side throughout his adulthood, manifesting powers allowing him to emit light and generate fire among other things and steadily improve on the powers he'd developed as a child, though still it remained a secret. He also begun to develop a resistance to diseases and his wounds would often heal a lot quicker. However it wasn't until his early to mid thirties that his wounds begun to heal instantly and his ageing slowed and, eventually, stopped completely. Though this seemed cool to Leda for about five minutes it soon sank in that this likely meant that he'd vastly outlive most of the people he loved, including his own children. Leda of course worked at the magic he was taught by his mother, getting better and better at it with the hopes of being able to help to heal more people from many different afflictions. Though by no means could he save every person who came to him or was brought to him. He'd often take in sick animals; such as dogs, cats, birds and such in order to bring up his experience and hone his skills with certain methods with various levels success. Shortly after the birth of their youngest son, R\u00fani, during a particularly hash winter; the village they were living in was raided out of desperation by people from a settlement further north, whose crops had failed and who had been running out of food. \u00c1sta was stabbed in the chest while trying to stop them from taking their food, as she was scared that they wouldn't find any more and children would starve. Though she managed to fend them off, and they had later come to their own grizzly ends, \u00c1sta's wound (though seeming initially not to be fatal) was later discovered to have gotten badly infected, and though Leda did his best to try to heal it, he failed and \u00c1sta died. Losing His Family[ ] Though Leda was heartbroken by the loss, he endeavoured to stay strong for his children, as they were obviously greatly affected by it too. He had trouble for a long time with not blaming himself for not noticing the infection when it wasn't too late to begin with, and also failing to heal her when it eventually did become obvious and therefore already untreatable. Leda just about managed to keep the family afloat with the resources he was able to get continuing with his healing, this and in the months after \u00c1sta's death, his fellow villagers helped him when they could, as he'd always helped them in the past when they'd needed it. Two years later, when the family was just getting more-or-less fully on its feet, and though he still missed \u00c1sta greatly, Leda was almost his old self. He attended the community gatherings again and trying to get out of his rut and more into a happier life with his friends and family. Cenr\u00edkr, his eldest son, was almost old enough to leave home at this point. Cenr\u00edkr was looking forward to it, he'd be able to make his own way in life, and he'd already fallen in love with a young woman called Ingr\u00ed\u00f0r. While Leda was happy about this he couldn't help having a natural worry for his son. It was around this time that a sickness travelled though the village. It happened from time to time; and back then, with the limited knowledge of how sickness works, they had no real recourse to stop them spreading. While usually, due to the fact he lived further away than most from the main town, and he was the healer, his family had come out of the previous ones okay. However, this time they were not so lucky. While he attempted to do his job, heal his fellow villagers, his elder daughter fell ill with the sickness, as did his infant son soon after. Though Leda tried his best to save their lives, it proved too difficult in the end. He'd had half the town in to care for and, while he couldn't help but prioritise his own children, there was little he could do for anyone other than try to give them a fighting chance with the basic medicine he had and pray that they made it. However, this not being very good medical practice, it didn't do much good at all. While some of the younger villagers made it through the fever, most did not. This included Ledan's two children, Sigr\u00ed\u00f0r and R\u00fani, who both passed away from the fever at different points in their second night after first showing symptoms. This of course devastated Leda, though this time he resolved to stay stronger this time for his children. He went ahead with helping his eldest son to marry and leave home, and trying to help his younger daughter, M\u00e6r, with her own slightly unconventional pursuits. He tried to appear okay, and it appeared he held up well outwardly. However, underneath it all, he was struggling. He pushed on, nonetheless, managing to get enough money from healing minor ailments and injuries to help his eldest son start his life with Ingr\u00ed\u00f0r in a nearby home. Ledan went on in his usual routine for several more years, as his younger son \u00c6lfr\u00edkr became more and more \"adventurous\". While this was completely normal for children his and even M\u00e6r's age, since they were considered to be close to adults in their society (somewhat like a late teenager), the general rule was not to stray too far from the village and to stick together. This was so that if something were to happen an adult would be close and could come to their assistance, and so as not to encroach on wolves' territories. Unfortunately, \u00c6lfr\u00edkr, did not listen and slipped away beyond the nearby river, and ended up being attacked. He survived long enough for someone to hear and find him before bringing him back to town. Leda went to see what was happening and had to fight his way to see his son only to get to say a few words of reassurance to him before he inevitably succumbed to his wounds. After losing another member of his family, Ledan decided it was best to move on. Especially since it was becoming acutely apparent he'd stopped ageing the way his fellow villagers were. He couldn't bear life in the village any more as the good memories there were marred by the bad. Since M\u00e6r was old enough to come with him in his mind, and Cenr\u00edkr had moved on as was living his own life with Ingr\u00ed\u00f0r, Ledan decided to leave the village with his daughter after several months; allowing his eldest child the chance to take over the job he'd always done. Perhaps he wanted to run from all that had happened, but the way Ledan saw it he was giving his son a chance to do well. He returned, of course, every now and again to visit his son, later his grandchildren, and offer him advice he'd picked up from his time as the village's healer. [ ] Ledan soon left to travel the area with his surviving daughter, M\u00e6r, who, while she was almost an 'adult' by the society's standards, he was still fiercely protective over. While he had concern for his son, it wasn't the same, Cenr\u00edkr fit in a lot better than even Ledan had, so he had no reservations that he could cope with independent life. He'd considered staying until she was old enough to leave home herself, however she expressed a desire to go with him; and as long as she was happy with going with him, and vice versa he saw no reason why she shouldn't. Being a rather adventurous young woman, it would probably be more fun for her, and Ledan had always been apprehensive she'd be forced into a boring life she never wanted to end up with. Ledan recognised her problems with not fitting in all too well, after all, his decision to remain in the same business as his mother led to a great deal of scorn towards him initially. While his son was technically in the same predicament, the village Ledan had raised them was acclimatised to a male healer. Worried as he was, he also knew he'd have been miserable doing anything else. Over the course of the years, Ledan used the fact he was moving around to occasionally visit his mother as well as his son and grandchildren without much of a risk of his lack of ageing being discovered. This went on for a while, but became less frequent when Ledan found out about the way in which his mother wished to prevent her ageing. His discovery of what she'd either already been doing or was planning to do caused a massive argument between himself and his mother. This led to Ledan refusing to visit Thyrv\u00ef for a long while, visiting only his son and his children from then on, in the hopes of it persuading her out of it. Ledan and M\u00e6r travelled the area (now known as Scandinavia) Ledan developing and expanding his (already pretty decent) knowledge and skill with magic and M\u00e6r enjoying the freedom and sense of adventure that came from not staying in one place for long. Eventually, however, M\u00e6r decided to go her own way and have her own intrepid adventures. By this time Ledan obviously wasn't surprised, and wasn't exceptionally concerned, as he knew from their time on the road she was able to handle herself. He'd taken her with him because he'd known she'd love this lifestyle, and that she would feel like an outsider if he didn't, and he was just glad he'd made the right call. With his daughter no longer at his side, this opened the door for Leda to, much less awkwardly anyway, look for romance. It'd been almost thirty years since \u00c1sta died. He would still have given anything to have her back, but he also knew that she'd want him to be happy. Though this caused a couple of less serious or short-lived encounters, as Ledan just couldn't seem to get himself to commit to it again after \u00c1sta. At some point M\u00e6r met a and fell for man called Magni, who she then married. Concerned as he often was about his youngest daughter, she was an adult now, and Ledan was pleased to see she was happy with him. Attacks from Angels[ ] As Ledan's powers begun to grow, what he truly was became increasingly plain to other angelic beings on sight, and with that came and inordinate amount of danger. Until this point, he'd been pretty much unaware of the extent of the danger he faced from angels; having never met one until this point, keeping his head down had worked fine. Now, however, angels could sense him. With the lies becoming more preposterous by the year, it was for this reason he decided to go to his mother to see if his father had said anything about how he could defend himself. By this time it had been several years since he'd talked to his mother, their fight having left them on bad terms. So showing up at her door again had been awkward, to say the least. Dispite his worries, however, she invited him in with open arms (or as open arms as she is prone to), despite her usual demeanour [Thyrv\u00ef](/wiki/Thyrv%C3%AF) loved her son, and had missed him. She told him about several [sigils](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Enochian_sigil) she'd remembered that [Jophiel](/wiki/Jophiel) had shown her which hid angels from other angels, and the two of them tried to work out how to use them to protect him. Their solution ended up being [amulets](/wiki/Nephilim_Hiding_Amulets) with the sigil carved onto them. he and Thyrv\u00ef made a couple for Leda (in case one broke or got lost and a few each for [Cenr\u00edkr](/wiki/Cenr%C3%ADkr) and [M\u00e6r](/wiki/M%C3%A6r). This did them well over the years, as it prevented angels from tracking them just by seeing their powers, making it only a risk that an angel might see them use their powers or hear about the man or woman who apparently doesn't age. It was only that level of it that they had to worry about now; which, while not perfect, was a gigantic weight off of Leda's shoulders, not only because he was safer, his children were too. [ ] Over the years it stayed much the same both of his children taking after him in their own ways, Leda adventuring, Cenr\u00edkr son working as he had as the village healer like he had before him and his daughter off on her own adventures. Over the years his family grew, with both of his surviving children having a few children of their own. Cenr\u00edkr had four children with his wife Ingr\u00ed\u00f0r: S\u00ed\u00f0a, Abj\u00f6rn, \u00deegn, Marger\u00f0r. M\u00e6r had two she married called Magni: Hr\u00f3kr and S\u00e1ga. Ironically old as it made him feel, Leda was pleased to be a grandfather and he doted on his grandchildren. Since it'd made even M\u00e6r and her husband come back to visit Cenr\u00edkr more, it made him visit home even more than usual just to see them all together. However, while [M\u00e6r](/wiki/M%C3%A6r), much like her father, stopped ageing in her mid twenties, [Cenr\u00edkr's](/wiki/Cenr%C3%ADkr) ageing merely slowed. It got to the point that one day, despite living to be over 100, Cen's his body couldn't take it any more, and he began to fall ill just like any other human man at the end of his life. As this began to happen, Ledan returned to their village to be there for his son, over the course of a year his condition worsened, to the point that by the end Ledan was the only person Cenr\u00edkr remembered. Despite Leda's attempts to heal him, finding it impossibly hard to let go of his little boy, he passed away at the age of 135 from an at the time unknown illness, cuddling his father for comfort. Leda was, of course, devastated, however he was glad that he'd lived such a long, full life; having had four children (as well as several grandchildren) of his own by the time his life came to an end. It was more than he could say about most of the others, after all. Yet still, naturally, it was impossibly hard for him to process. It was this death that inspired him to look further than Scandinavia, where he'd been always lived. Again, perhaps he'd been running away from the memories locked up in the area or perhaps he wanted to do more, but he decided that that was what was best for him. He started by travelling the rest of Europe, Athens, Rome, everywhere he could get to, places it took him months to get to even only with minimal stops for rest; to places which seemed like whole other worlds to Ledan. At first it seemed overwhelming to him (naturally, he'd lived in the same general area for so long) but it quickly became simply exciting. He tried his best to blend in, starting off terrible at it but slowly learning how to make himself stand out less wherever he was. Eventually it begun to come as naturally as acclimatising to a new village back in Scandinavia. Just a few strange things to get used to as he adjusted, though always just as a passer by. These days he never really felt as if he had a full, real home, an idea he was fine with now. All the while, the attacks from angels still went on, just infrequently now he could make the carved amulets. With an apparent level of destabilisation in heaven, a lot of angels seemed to be falling these days; which meant a few more nephilim. They weren't exactly like Leda, their parents tended to be [seraphim](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/seraphim) (but were more than occasionally [cherubim](https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/cherubim)). Despite this, it was good to see, and Leda liked to try to locate them in order to pass on amulets to them if he could. During this time the angels, obviously, spent more time looking for the nephilim; after all, they were abominations, and the angels had clear instructions on what they had to do about them. It was during this time that M\u00e6r found her mission. Like her father, M\u00e6r also made it her life's mission to fight angels and to protect other nephilim with the knowledge they had. Ledan, his daughter, and his two surviving grandchildren met as frequently as they could over the years, arranging their meetings via magical letters. Hr\u00f3kr and S\u00e1ga were grown as well now, and like their mother took on the task as well, at their meetings the four of them would check in, share information and amulets, and perhaps most importantly to them share life updates and laughs. Athens (8BC - 22AD)[ ] During the intervening years Leda expanded his travels, he wanted to travel the world; while places such as Australia and the Americas hadn't yet been discovered as far as Europe was concerned, he wanted to see all the world he knew about. He spent a lot of the earlier years in southern Europe. This included places like Athens, the rest of Greece, Rome and Pompeii. Each place managed to come across different people who were in need of his services, and sometimes more complicated things than just healings, over the years. This is how he begun to get into curse and hex removal, among other kinds of things. It was during one of his times in Greece during the end of the BC era and ushering in the ADs years (though that wouldn't be significant to them), in a forest, he met a dryad called [Nissa](/wiki/Nissa). He told her of his travels and what he did for a living and she asked that, in exchange for a favour in return, for him to find a way to protect her tree (to which she was bound) from harm completely. Him doing this would allow her to see more of the world, as she'd always wanted to, and after hearing of his travels she'd seen a kindred spirit in Leda. Despite the fact he couldn't do anything to help her after all, Nissa appreciated his trying. The two sparked up a flirtatious friendship, during which time he continued to try and find solutions to the problem Nissa was having, feeling bad since they were friends at this point and he felt like he'd let her down slightly, as each spell they tried had either little or no effect at all. He eventually came to focus almost entirely on the task, as he feared someone would harm her out of carelessness. This meant that in order to see Nissa, Ledan would have to travel into the forest in which he'd met her until eventually he found something that worked properly, which fully protected Nissa's tree. Over the years this close flirtatious friendship became something more serious, and for the first time in hundreds of years Ledan found himself in a genuine romantic relationship. While this wasn't the first relationship he'd been in since \u00c1sta had died, not by a long shot, it was the first serious one. He'd come to care a lot about Nissa, and eventually decided to introduce her to [Thyrv\u00ef](/wiki/Thyrv%C3%AF). This proved to be a terrible idea as Leda's mother went berserk upon meeting her, coming up with various excuses to take an instant dislike to the dryad. Despite trying hard to persuade her that Nissa was a good woman. However, Thyrv\u00ef was as insistent and stubborn as ever to the point of just being cruel to her, again leading to a rift between her and her son. During this time, having chosen to (obviously) side with Nissa as she had done nothing wrong, and thus he and Thyrv\u00ef, again, didn't speak for a long while. The two of them travelled together for a long while, and for the first time in a her years, Nissa got to see the wider world than the area surrounding her tree; despite actually being older than Ledan by a rather considerable amount. She viewed the world with the same awe he had years and years ago. While he by no means forgot his troubles, he felt a lot better than he had in a while. Seeing new places kept him on his toes, quenched his thirst for adventure. What was better is the places he'd already been changed so much over time, and that had to be one of the most fascinating things to experience, as no regular human got to. It made it even more interesting and fun for him, and it also meant that even when he left a place he'd been for a long while he'd still have someone there that he knows. Not that being without had caused him any harm, it was just a nice change. At some point, Ledan felt the need to try and make up with his mother, though after all she'd done to her, Nissa understandably refused to talk to her. This meant Leda had to go alone to see her in a smaller town west of Athens, with Nissa remaining in Athems while Ledan stayed was visiting [Thyrv\u00ef](/wiki/Thyrv%C3%AF). The reunion went as well as could really be expected, he agreed he would visit but would still ignore her \"advice\". Pompeii (23AD - 65AD)[ ] Between the years 23 and 65 Ledan and Nissa lived in the town of Pompeii, having spent the years between their time in Athens and there more or less travelling non stop, they felt the need to settle for a while. While here Ledan had the opportunity to vastly broaden his horizons with his magic, even more than before. Not only did he do protection and healing spells he tirelessly worked to reverse the hexes and curses of other witches as there were a few other in the area, because (as mentioned earlier) he found it it quite the fascinating hobby once he got started with it. It was like unravelling a mystery or solving a complex puzzle. Considering the gravity of the situations people were in he felt bad for liking it, but nonetheless he did. One example, the one he remembers most vividly, of these occasions was a young woman, who came to Ledan in a moment of distress. She had discovered a series of letters to herself (in her own handwriting) telling her to seek help as her former lover was controlling her to love him again by making her forget everything leading up to her leaving him. They explained to her that she had moments when she would remember and realise this and be aware of what was happening but these would soon disappear and she would be back to her controlled state with no memory of writing the letters. It took Ledan a long time, but he worked out a way to reverse the control he had over her. He never found out what happened to the man, but his client had made him promise her that he would not to hurt him. This was a promise he found extremely hard to keep. After a while of living in Pompeii, however, due to his reversal of certain curses form certain powerful witches, Leda was becoming somewhat unpopular with the darker witches in town, dark witches didn't like it when some foreign witch swanned into town reversing all of their hard work for profit. So he and Nissa left the city for somewhere a bit different. It was around this time that he and Nissa split, caring about each other still but having lost the spark that was once there. [ ] After a long time of travelling and the end of his relationship with Nissa, Ledan decided it was time to return home for a while. Far easier now he could teleport, it seemed like the right thing for him to do for himself. Things were familiar there, but also very different. The language had changed, and the way they celebrated the festivals had in many ways too. It was interesting, but also somewhat alienating. He spent a lot of time with his grandmother at this time, since she was in the area. It was her that 'dragged' Ledan to a party to celebrate [L\u00ed\u00fea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litha). It was at this event Ledan met [Baelinar](/wiki/Baelinar). At some point in 115 AD, M\u00e6r, Hr\u00f3kr and S\u00e1ga (working together at the time) had a run-in with a large band of angels while trying to help a young nephilim in what would be southern Norway now. They were caught off-guard, outnumbered, and all three were tragically killed. Ledan didn't find out about this for a fair while, until she didn't show up to the next place they planned to meet. It started with worry, which turned to panic. He only discovered their fate for sure a few months later after he finally tracked down someone who knew for sure what happened. His younger daughter death hit him differently to the others, for one by this time it's been over 400 years since she was born, Ledan had spent multiple lifetimes always knowing he'd had his little girl, always trusting that, she and the grandchildren been almost all he had left. Now it was only him and his grandmother. On the other hand he was proud they'd tried to help that young nephilim, even if it led to them dying, he knew that that was and incredibly M\u00e6r thing to do, and in turn she'd passed that bravery and kindness to her children. Despite this he was still devastated to lose yet another child. Losing his grandchildren at the same time, was utterly devastating. Venice (1310-1499)[ ] 16th Century[ ] Ledan spent the majority of the 1500s in South India, initially having planned to stay just for a small while but getting caught up trying to cure a strange illness that was hitting the area. While to the locals it seemed like any other kind of sickness, to Ledan it was clearly more, there was something magic in it, as the way it was spreading and the way it acted made apparent. He attempted to \"heal\" multiple people of the \"sickness\" failing most times but occasionally having slightly more luck with it but no complete successes (as the person would get the illness again soon after) until he watched a local witch try something that seemed to work. While he wanted to ask her about this she made an excuse and vanished. Leda did his best to try and replicate the results but continuously fell flat, trying to track this woman in order to ask her how she could ask her a few questions. Initially, he wondered if she had something to do with the 'sickness', though he didn't see it as incredibly likely, considering the healing. He heard word of some successful healings in a neighbourhood in [Madurai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai), jumping on the chance to find out how it was she was healing these people, only wanting to help out if he could. However, he didn't find her, what he found was a neighbourhood filled with people in desperate need of healing; this just made him wonder \"why didn't she heal everyone?\". While this was going on he was still making headway with fixing the illness; he still didn't know what was causing it but now he was doing better in terms of fixing it for individual people, though not all. This led him to think the woman perhaps couldn't heal everyone, since it seemed to very much depend on the person for him as well. It was months before he even saw the woman again, and this time it was completely by accident. Having seen him try to heal people from whatever it was a few times, she finally believed that she could trust the nephilim, if only in the simplest sense that she figured he hadn't caused thus. She explained to him that magic had travelled down in her family, they'd always just been naturally drawn to it, and so they'd learnt and developed their own very unique methods over time. This was why nothing he knew worked, her methods were completely different to his and apparently lended themselves a lot more to this specific situation. The woman showed him how to do what she was doing and he found himslef able to help out with some of the work, though they by no means could handle the situation entirely; to do that they had to find the source. This eventually led to him meeting a man calld [Amrit Nayak](/wiki/Amrit_Nayak), whose eldest daughter, [Jayamani](/wiki/Jayamani_Nayak), had come down with the \"illness\", shortly after his wife had, and whom had also seen Ledan healing other people. Ledan informed Amrit that he couldn't be sure it would work but he was definitely happy to try to help her. Terrified at the prospect of it not working as he was, he'd seen what it did to other people after all, Amrit seemed to accept this. When Amrit's wife passed away from its effects, they knew the situation was urgent for Jaya. Ledan performed the hex reversal as soon as he can, and thankfully it did manage to reverse the curse for her. After a few days she was back to normal, with seemingly no ill effects left. 19th Century[ ] 20th Century[ ] During the 20th century, Ledan spent most of the time in staying in Britain, having come to like the place. While it wasn't exactly heaven on earth the vibrant community there kept him exited. He spent a the fist few decades keeping to London, under the alias he'd had at the tail end of the 19th century. However, as with all of his aliases the ruse was starting to get unbelievable as he was a man who looked to be about 30-35 by this time as his alias, Ledan Hawk, he was claiming to be in his mid 50s. While in past he'd gotten away with this for a few years people started to wonder after a while. Despite having come to love the place it was starting to become time to leave. He eventually decided to start anew and move away down to Swansea, as he heard from a friend about a thriving magic community in the area. He took on a new alias, as usual, this time calling himself \"Ledan \u00c5ke S\u00f6renson\" in official records (him being listed as a British man from a Swedish family), so as not to arouse suspicion due to him not ageing since he took on his former alias. The old him, as usual, simply disappeared, and he reinvented himself in his new home, only a few people knowing him truly. It was here, during the 1930s and 1940s, he met [Luna Gray](/wiki/Luna_Gray), a young and especially talented witch (for her years anyway), who helped her mother to sell magical supplies and potions in secret in central Swansea to other fellow witches. This was how he met her, considering he needed to restock on magical supplies quite a lot living in a big city and frequented the supply shop. At gatherings he came to know Luna well, discovering common ground in an interest in spells that revolved around the removal of curses and hexes (Ledan's speciality). Before they knew it the two had sparked up a romantic relationship. This was obviously complicated, however, after the beginning of the Second World War, and considering the political climate. It was also during this era Leda developed his love of jazz music that he still has this day. While fond of the classics as anyone, jazz music just spoke to him in a way it didn't. He used to try to dance to it with Luna, despite the fact he famously has two left feet. However, at peace with that fact and as long as Luna didn't mind, he embraced it and took the obvious jokes that came his way in good humour. He took on a position in the [Royal Air Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force), resolving to himself to not interfere to heavily in the events with his powers. He eventually garnered the rank of Wing Commander [[2]](#cite_note-ranks-2) [[3]](#cite_note-ranks2-3) [[4]](#cite_note-ranks3-4) over his time in the service during the war. Every time he was back home he'd spend as much time with Luna as he could, for obvious reasons. Despite the tenuousness of the situation they were in throughout the time they were together, their relationship was one of the most stable Ledan had had in a very long time. For the most part, Leda tried to lay low, having been in many wars before in his life, he knew that there was only so much one person could do. He gained a reputation for making sure no one in his team died in situations where it seemed astounding to the point of impossibility he could have managed it. Obviously, he used his powers to achieve this, figuring it was the least he could do given the powers he had at his disposal, despite the fact he couldn't reveal them. However, at least a few of his friends over time had an inkling there was more to Ledan than met the eye, though they never stated as such to him until a lot later. After the war was over, he and Luna finally reunited and got to spend most of their time together. They continued their relationship into the early 50s, when eventually Luna wanted to get married and have children, as she'd always wanted to and it was getting to the point where she wanted to have them. Ledan told her that he couldn't do that yet, not cause he didn't want to, but despite how long it'd been he was still afraid of having children again only to lose them like he had before. This devastated Luna and eventually led to the end of the relationship, and is still one of Leda's biggest regrets in life. Moving to the USA[ ] At some point later, while they'd agreed to keep in touch, they both moved on from the area, Luna to another part of Swansea and Leda out of the country to America to explore a bit more. He stared off in New York state, finding a great environment for his talents there, due to the shire amount of people in the state's main city. He was able to find a surprising amount of normal people in need (or simply wanting) his help. In the 50s, Wicca had started to become popular and while it wasn't something he believed in or put a lot of stock into he was glad that it caused more people to be willing to give him a chance. At some point his ex girlfriend, Luna, found another person to be with and whom she'd eventually marry by the name of [Richard Morgan](/wiki/Richard_Morgan). Despite their past, Leda made an effort to be her friend, them having got on well before their romantic relationship began anyway. He found himself visiting her and her husband on occasion, getting to know them both very well and soon viewing Richard as a friend as well, him being a laid back man. As a result he was like an \"uncle\" to their children ( [Henry](/wiki/Henry_Morgan), [Debra](/wiki/Debra_Young), Edmund and [Nathan](/wiki/Nathan_Morgan)) as they grew up, visiting them often. He spent a large chunk of his time in Las Vegas from the late 70s and through to the mid 90s, again having heard about a fair amount of witches (if not really a community per se) in that area. He wound up glad to have gone there as he found another group of like-minded people who he would later come to view as friends. With very few people as skilled as him in terms of competition in the area, but just enough to cause a few problems for him to fix. It was the best of both worlds. It wasn't so much that he wanted more of the money involved for himself so much as he wanted to make sure that he had work to do. Despite how long it'd been, he still enjoyed his job. It was one of infinite possibilities, after all. He met a jazz singer and fellow witch called [Noah Motsepe](/wiki/Noah_Motsepe) in a bar there. The two steadily struck up a flirtatious friendship as Leda frequented the bar he sang at, due to Noah finding Leda's enjoyment of his singing amusing. Noah expressed ambitions of owning his own, similar place and Ledan admitted he didn't really have anything in mind for the future, just imagining he'd continue doing as he was now. Noah initially was concerned about this, feeling as if Leda lacked ambitions and that worried him, however he soon realised Ledan just really enjoyed his work. Eventually these two formed a [romantic relationship](/wiki/Noah_and_Ledan) which lasted for a few years in the late 80s and early 90s before a less than amicable break up abruptly ended it. While initially they were on bad terms, over the years when their paths have crossed again due to their running in similar circles, they've managed to get to the point where they can consider each other friends again (this bit needs to be discussed with the other mun to elaborate on). He remained in Vegas until around 1996 when he decided he needed a change of scene. The change of scene was pretty massive, it being the difference between the desert in Nevada and the snow and beautuful forests of Vermont. He went for somewhere completely different on purpose, wanting a completely different backdrop to clear his head. Pre-series[ ] By mid 90s Ledan had set himself and his business up again to the extent it was before in the small town of Fleetwood, Vermont, buying a fairly fancy property there. He relied mainly on old clients who followed his business when they needed it (and passing on his praises to their friends) as well as his friends referring clients to him when it fit his areas of expertise (and he would do the opposite). Since he was so remote at this point, however he often had to go to the client or go out to find clients though travel as he had before he'd ever stayed in one place for a long period of time; this time he just had a base to go back to now. It was a light change in his usual operation, but with his ability to teleport, it became a lot easier to find clients. He appreciated the new remote locale despite this, not only did it remind him of home, it felt like a breath of fresh air to be able to sit down and relax some days. Much as he loved his work he could have done with some time off, and while he had before, he'd not really had quiet like this in several hundred years. Not that he never went out of the small town for some adventure, he just left to do that when he chose to. At some point during this time Ledan attended [Amrit's ](/wiki/Amrit_Nayak) 500th birthday, which is fairly frequently referenced by anyone who attended, as apparently it got pretty out of hand. Supernatural[ ] Note/Disclaimer: A lot of this will be referring to a personal verse between me and my friends, consider anything mentioning canon characters dependent on either your willingness to acknowledge it. I don't always play Leda involved at all in the actual events of Supernatural directly. Things with titles other than \"Season\" are his subplots, which will always be in his 'canon' as having happened, but just happen to have occurred during the show's timeline at some point. Season 3[ ] Season 4[ ] Season 5[ ] Season 6[ ] Season 7[ ] Season 8[ ] Season 9[ ] Season 10[ ] The Hex[ ] At some point towards the end of season 9 and the beginning of season 10, Ledan was hexed by his long-time friend [Myrrine](/wiki/Myrrine), due to her panicking over Ledan's affiliation with certain hunters. Ironically, she was sure she was pre-empting a betrayal on his part. However, Ledan obviously had no intention of betraying his friend. Ledan didn't know the full nature of the hex or even who placed it on him for some time, only that it was powerful and that even he, a powerful and knowledgeable witch specialising in these things, found himself at a loss to reverse it. In the beginning Ledan shrugged it off as nothing, mainly seeing it as a nuisance and something that he would find a solution for, it was just trickier than usual. This calm reaction is likely because Ledan had rivals attempt to (and sometimes succeed in) hexing him on a myriad of occasions, there was bound to be one that would give him a little bit of a run for his money. Soon, however, he and his \"inner circle\" became concerned. Nothing was working and Ledan was slowly appearing to sicken, this was not normal him at this point, having not experienced this in over a thousand years. Soon it became apparent that using any of the powers he'd gained from his father was making it worse, they were draining his energy and strength. Soon, advanced uses of his powers caused dizzy spells and nosebleeds among other things. Season 11[ ] The Death of Thyrv\u00ef[ ] Season 12[ ] Season 13[ ] Season 14[ ] Season 15[ ] The War of the Gods[ ] The Death of Zeus[ ] Name[ ] is a \"Norsified\" version of a Fae name comes from words from Leda's grandmother's language Fae; it comes from It was likely chosen by Thyrv\u00ef due to the coincidentally similar words in their own language, Ancient Nordic ('Heim\u00e1m\u00e1l') meaning \"to guide/go\" or \"to endure\", as it was common to name children after some form of strength or power. The word in question helped form the word 'lead' over time in English [[18]](#cite_note-leadetymology-18) [[19]](#cite_note-leadetymology2-19) [[20]](#cite_note-leadetymology3-20). An awkward by-product of this is that his anglicised name Ledan can mean \"boredom\" in Swedish (the modern day language of where he was born) and his nickname Leda is considered feminine, and is occasionally confused with the name of Greek mythological character, Leda; which is usually pronounced slightly differently than his nickname (usually pronounced Lay-duh [led]. Both, however, have nothing to do with his name. Alternate Names[ ] [V\u00e1li](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1li_(son_of_Loki)): In Norse Mythology V\u00e1li is the name of either a son of [Loki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki)or a son of [Odin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin), or is the name of two separate entities one being the son of Loki and the other being the son of Odin [[1]](#cite_note-v%C3%A1liwiki-1) [[21]](#cite_note-v%C3%A1liodinsonwiki-21). In the case of the verse, this was a nickname given to Leda by [his pa\u00f0i](/wiki/Gabriel_(TheSnailQueen))that was intended to mean \"little Valkyrie\". It's also the name by which he's known in Norse Mythology, as a result of Odin's machinations. - L\u00edfa: a much Old Norse name [[22]](#cite_note-l%C3%ADfanordicnames-22), often shortened as L\u00edf or considered a variant of L\u00edf [[23]](#cite_note-l%C3%ADfnordicnames-23)and Hl\u00edf whcich is even moreso word \"l\u00edf\" meaning \"life\" the \"shield\". In foretold to survive Ragnarok and repopulate the earth [[25]](#cite_note-l%C3%ADfandl%C3%ADf%C3%BErasir-25), this of corse has no relation to Li\u00f0an himself. [Thyrv\u00ef](/wiki/Thyrv%C3%AF)likely picked this as it also resembled a fae name, L\u00edfr\u00edn [[16]](#cite_note-faelang-16) [[17]](#cite_note-faename-17), coming from the fae L\u00edfain, which is a kind of red flower. Trivia[ ] - Leda speaks with a somewhat \"unpeaceable\" accent. - If anyone guesses they tend to guess \"Icelandic\" or \"Faroese\". - when alone at home, or when he speaks with his family, it's noticeably more pronounced. - He can sing quite well with an accent, he sounds awful putting one on. - His favourite colour is purple, specifically dark purple. - Ledan smokes cigarettes because he was reccomended to by his doctor in 1923, he hasn't been able to kick them since, but since he's immune to their harms it's not been a priority for him. - Ledan's enjoys jazz music, often listening to it as he reads or occasionally live. He also enjoys big band music as well as blues and swing. - One of his favourite singers is Frank Sinatra, who he frequently listens to. - Another seems to be Ella Fitzgerald. - He hates chocolate. He finds milk and light chocolate sickly sweet and, while he doesn't hate it as much, doesn't enjoy the flavour of dark chocolate that much. - Ledan has a few tattoos, one being the runic letters \" \" on his left arm (his children's initials in order of their age), and another being a traditional tree of life (Yggdrasil) on his left angle. - Ledan is a fan of single malt scotch whisky, and appears to have collected a lot of bottles over his many years, some gifts and some presumably purchased. - He'll usually order [Chivas Regal](http://img1.findthebest.com/sites/default/files/821/media/images/Chivas_Regal_12_Year_Old_Scotch_5697527.jpg)at bars, simply because it's his favourite that most bars sell. - He doesn't seem to like Bourbon, stating that it lacks the smoky, peaty flavour found in scotch whisky - He'll usually order - He is terrible at certain kinds of dancing, which is the subject of many jokes among his friends. Ledan doesn't seem to take offence to this and often chimes in with his own jokes. He has explained that he dances 'exactly' like \"a dad at a BBQ\". - He isn't bad, however, at more \"classical\" kinds of dance, having learned how to do that right over hundreds of years. - He bought the Tarot deck he uses today before the cards were used as divining tools. He'd already bought his deck in Venice in 1498, and originally used it to play [tarocchini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarocchini). - Leda has been a vegetarian since 1972, 50 years in total. - He doesn't allow meat in his home (other than the meat for his cats), and never cooks it. - He bonded with Mary Winchester over the fact they're both vegetarians. - Leda is an amazing cook, this is as a result of years and years of practising magic, which (his kind at least) uses mostly the same skills as cooking, especially since cooking is a hobby of his. - He also bonded with Mary Winchester over the fact they're both keen cooks. - Leda gets into many of the holidays brought over from pagan traditions. He's particularly fond of Halloween and Christmas and will decorate his house enthusiastically. - Ledan can speak a fair few languages, however these were all picked up by either places he's been (i.e Ancient Rome) or the dominant language of the time, due to necessity (his own language was, after all, pretty rarely spoken as it was). - For this reason, he's currently trying to learn Mandarin (but is so far shit at it). - He has 6 cats; Le\u00edfr (male), Freja (female), Hildr (female), Le\u00edfi (male), M\u00e6r (female) and Fr\u00f3\u00f0i (male, kitten). All of whom he adores. - Leda speaks in his first language (Ancient Nordic) when not around his clients as this is how he talks to his cats and he uses it to label all of his ingredients. - He reads mainly books from Iceland, as the language is similar to his own, he was able to pick it up rather easily. He enjoys crime and thriller books, as well as fantasy. - Leda likes Norse mythology/things with Norse mythology in them; he finds it nostalgic. - Leda is fond of and had has many vintage cars and motorbikes, he's particularly fond of 50s British motorbikes; he BSA Golden Triumph Thunderbird](http://www.realclassic.co.uk/tbird03040901.jpg) 1959 Cadillac Eldorado](http://kilbeysclassics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cadillac-eldorado-biarritz-convertible-1959-11.jpg), convertible (blue) [A 1959 Chevrolet Impala](http://marlin-car.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1959-chevy-impala-convertible-cp6gnrml.jpg), convertible (red) - - Leda is quite sentimental, he keeps things he likes from time to time meaning that he has what could be described as a mini-museum of ancient/antique but mostly otherwise valueless items in his attic. - He kept his previous alias far too long, from 1980 to 2020, starting him of as 18 and allowing him to reach the incredibly hard to believe age of 58 (considering Ledan's appearance) - Leda was the oldest character on-show with a full, stated, exact age (it can be inferred that he celebrated his 2,359th birthday on the 28th of October this year, as in 2015 he was 2,354 on the same day, showing his birth year must have been 339BC). However there are many far older beings around, their exact age is just never specified. This was until we found out [Baelinar](/wiki/Baelinar)'s exact age to be several trillion. - During his time near [Mount Mansfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mansfield)(the largest mountain in Vermont, which is near Ledan's previous town [Fleetwood](/wiki/Fleetwood,_Vermont)), Ledan got into winter sports, doing it enough to become a passable skier and a pretty decent snowboarder. - This is what led to his decision to move to [Fontaine](/wiki/Fontaine,_Vermont)specifically, as his alias had gotten far too old for it to be considered realistic at 58. Fontaine is close to [Stratton Mountain](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Stratton_Mountain)and the rest of the [Green Mountains](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Mountains), and is a prime place for Ledan to continue his hobby. - This is what led to his decision to move to References[ ] - NOTE 1: Since I could find research for the magic (among other things) of a lot later in Scandinavian history, I have based my research on that, assuming that attitudes were similar, though the only research I could find suggests that attitudes were probably slightly less melodramatic. I have based related aspects of the biography on this. This is since we don't know much about this period of history, or I at least don't have access to the information. - [1.0](#cite_ref-v%C3%A1liwiki_1-0) [1.1](#cite_ref-v%C3%A1liwiki_1-1)Several Wiki Users.

Even younger children took on some adult responsibilities. In order to qualify to be a judge in court, a man need be only 12 years old. Although children were excused from attacks and battles and permitted to leave before a fight began, some young children initiated lethal revenge attacks.) - [16.0](#cite_ref-faelang_16-0) [16.1](#cite_ref-faelang_16-1)King, R.
