Air pollution can be found both indoors and out. Outdoor pollutants include a variety of gases and particles. Carbon Monoxide, Ozone, metals such as Lead and Nickel, Nitrogen and Dioxide can present in varying quantities in the air we breathe. Particulate matter from fuel combustion, industrial processes, farming, and even roadwork can also pollute our air and get into our bodies. Inside our homes pollutants like tobacco smoke and synthetic scented sprays can wreak havoc on our respiratory and other systems. All air pollutants destroy the natural balance of our environment and harm the quality of the air we breathe. Though it's next to impossible to completely avoid air pollution, you can help your body safely and naturally detoxify to minimize pollution's impact on your health. The Effects On Your Lungs Of Air Pollution Pollutants in our air can have serious effects on your health. Symptoms ranging from coughing and respiratory irritation to serious diseases can all result from breathing tainted air. Air pollution generates free radicals' atoms that are highly reactive with other cells because they contain unpaired electrons. Free radicals damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes by stealing their electrons. This causes oxidative stress in your body that leads to chronic disease. Cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, heart attack, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and chronic inflammation can all result from free radical damage caused by air pollution. Unfortunately, there is not much we can do to control our exposure to air pollution. Though you can research air quality and try to avoid living in highly polluted areas, most of us don't have the luxury of relocating based on air quality alone. Eating a diet rich in antioxidants and Omega 3 fatty acids can help your body fight the negative effects of air pollution. In addition, wearing a mask when you know you'll spend a prolonged period of time around fumes or when painting or working with known pollutants can also help. One of the best ways to relieve the symptoms of inhaling air contaminants is to detoxify the body. As pollutants build up in our tissues, we can support our body's natural defenses and help our systems move these toxic invaders out. Often we're not even aware of how much of these harmful toxins have accumulated in our systems. That's why regularly taking measures to help rid the body of the negative impacts of air pollution is a great idea for your overall health. proBLEN Lung Detox offers a homeopathic oral spray to help you do just that. Use it to support detoxification of your lungs and temporarily relieve symptoms associated with inhaling polluted air be it indoors or out. proBLEN spray is easy to use and safe, with no side effects.

Try proBLENopathy Lung Detox and breathe easier. How Homeopathic Detox Works proBLEN Lung Detox is different than other detoxes you may see advertised online. In fact, many of these products are unproven and could even be dangerous. Instead of using a host of ingredients to force detoxification on your body in an unhealthy way, ProBLEN Lung Detox using gentle, natural ingredients that support and encourage your body's own detoxification processes. Ingredients such as Argentum Nitricum and Arsenicum Album support asthma symptoms and relieve symptoms of bronchial asthma. Carduus Marianus is used to support the vascular system and the liver when disease is present. Heper Suis 6x temporarily relieves the symptoms of aging such as: low energy, poor muscle/fat balance, and sleepness. And, Mercurlus Corrosivus is a homeopathic remedy used for sore throats, diarrhea and anxiety. Finally, Plumbum Metallicum can work wonders on the pain or lack of feeling that is suffered as a result of various neurological conditions.
