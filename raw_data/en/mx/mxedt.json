Getting started Online Application Instructions [See the online application video](https://youtu.be/WlBmn-dnick). [Online application instructions are on our website](/licenses-permits-and-certificates/professions-new-renew-or-update/online-licensing). Online applications are accessed through SecureAccess Washington (SAW) security portal. You'll need to add the Department of Health Online Application Portal service to access the online applications. The first time you add the service, you'll be prompted to answer several questions to verify your identity. The questions will match the name and address you provide with the existing public record information. Because the questions come from public record, you need to provide a complete address and your full legal name as it appears on your driver's license or birth certificate. You may find you have to enter a former address, especially if your address has changed recently (within the past one or two years) to get the right questions that pertain to your identity. If don't have sufficient information in the public record to verify your identity and aren't currently credentialed by the Department of Health, then you'll need to submit a paper application, as you won't be able to access the Online Application Portal. Once you have completed the process you will receive an email with your pending credential number, or you may look on [Provider Credential Search](/licenses-permits-and-certificates/provider-credential-search). Refer to this credential number any time you contact Department of Health or submit paperwork. - - Apply on paper - The following forms are required for completing the application process.
