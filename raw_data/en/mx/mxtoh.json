FF-1 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV A-1Introduction (Last updated May 29, 2018; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Opportunistic infections (OIs) were the first clinical manifestations that alerted clinicians to the occurrence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAC) disease, and pneumococcal respiratory disease, as well as certain cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma and central nervous system lymphoma, have been hallmarks of AIDS. These OIs, and many more, occurred on average 7 to 10 years after infection with HIV . 1,2 Until effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) was developed, patients generally survived only 1 to 2 years after the initial manifestation of AIDS.3 HIV-related OIs have been defined as infections that are more frequent or more severe because of HIV-mediated immunosuppression. 4 Starting in the late 1980s, the use of chemoprophylaxis, immunization, and better strategies for managing OIs improved quality of life and lengthened survival of persons with HIV . 5 Early antiretroviral drugs and treatment strategies added further benefit.6 However, the introduction of highly effective combination ART in the mid-1990s has had the most profound influence on reducing OI-related morbidity and mortality in persons with HIV . 7-11 Despite the availability of multiple safe, effective, and simple ART regimens, and a corresponding steady decline in the incidence of OIs, 11 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 40% of Americans with HIV are not effectively virally suppressed.12-17 As a result, OIs continue to cause preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States.18 Achieving and maintaining durable viral suppression in all people with HIV , and thus preventing or substantially reducing the incidence of HIV related OIs, remains challenging for three main reasons: Not all HIV infections are diagnosed, and once diagnosed many persons have already experienced substantial immunosuppression. CDC estimates that in 2015, 15% of the people with HIV in the United States were unaware of their infections.19 Among those with diagnosed HIV , more than 50% had had HIV for more than 3 years20 and approximately 20% had a CD4 count mm3 (or <14%) at the time of diagnosis.20,21 Not all persons with diagnosed HIV receive timely continuous HIV care or are prescribed ART. CDC estimates that in 2015, 16% of persons with newly diagnosed HIV had not been linked to care within 3 months and among persons living with HIV only 57% were adequately engaged in continuous care. 21 Not all persons tr eated for HIV achieve durable viral suppression. CDC estimates that in 2014, only 49% of diagnosed patients were effectively linked to care and had durable viral suppression.22 Causes for the suboptimal response to treatment include poor adherence, unfavorable pharmacokinetics, or unexplained biologic factors. 23,24 Thus, some persons with HIV infection will continue to present with an OI as the sentinel event leading to a diagnosis of HIV infection or present with an OI as a complication of unsuccessful viral suppression. Durable viral suppression eliminates most but not all OIs. Tuberculosis, pneumococcal disease, and dermatomal zoster are examples of infectious diseases that occur at higher incidence in persons with HIV regardless of CD4 count. The likelihood of each of these OIs occurring does vary inversely with the CD4 count, however. 23-31 When certain OIs occur\u2014 most notably tuberculosis and syphilis\u2014they can increase plasma viral load,32-37 which both accelerates HIV progression and increases the risk of HIV transmission. Thus, clinicians continue to need to be knowledgeable about the prevention and management of HIV-related OIs. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV A-2History of These Guidelines In 1989, the Guidelines for Prophylaxis Against Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia for Persons Infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus became the first HIV-related treatment guideline published by the U.S. government.38 This guideline was published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), which was the most rapid mode of publication at the time. It was followed by a guideline on prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex disease in 1993. 39 In 1995, these guidelines were expanded to include the treatment of 18 HIV-related OIs. In 2004, information about the prevention of HIV-related OIs was incorporated into the guidelines. The NIH, the CDC, and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) now jointly co-sponsor these guidelines, 4,40-42 which have been published in peer-reviewed journals and/or the MMWR in 1997, 1999, and 2002.41-53 Since 2009, the guidelines have been managed as a living document on the web with each chapter reviewed quarterly by the guidelines committee. Updates are published as often and as promptly as deemed appropriate by the guidelines committee. Data regarding the use of these guidelines demonstrate that the document is a valuable reference for HIV health care providers. In 2017, there were almost 423,075 page views of the online version of the guidelines, and almost 4,000 pdf downloads. All guideline recommendations regarding therapy and prevention are rated in terms of the quality of supporting evidence; comments about diagnosis are not rated. These ratings allow readers to assess the relative importance of each recommendation. This document focuses on adults and adolescents; recommendations for children with HIV can be found in separate documents at https://aidsinfo.nih.gov . These guidelines are intended for clinicians, other health care providers, patients with HIV , and policy makers in the United States. Guidelines pertinent to other regions of the world, especially resource-limited countries, may differ with respect to the spectrum of relevant OIs and the diagnostic and therapeutic options that are available to clinicians. Guidelines Development Process These guidelines were prepared by the OI Working Group under the auspices of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC), an authorized Federal Advisory Committee to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services established in 1994. Briefly, co-editors who are selected and appointed by their respective agencies or organizations (i.e., NIH, CDC, IDSA) convene OI specific working groups of clinicians and scientists with subject matter expertise in those specific OIs. The co-editors appoint a leader for each working group. The working groups review in real time the relevant literature published since the last review of the guidelines and, if indicated, propose revised recommendations, which are then presented to the co-editors and other working group leaders. The co-editors and working group leaders have a teleconference quarterly to determine changes in each section that are indicated. The co-editors also convene a meeting of subject group leads at ID Week each year to review progress and set an agenda for the coming year. Final guidelines revisions posted on the AIDSinfo website may include additional changes made by the co-editors under the advisement of Office of AIDS Research Advisory Committee (OARAC). The names and affiliations of all contributors as well as their financial disclosures are provided in Panel Roster and Financial Disclosures (Appendix C). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV A-3Guidelines Development Process Topic Comment Goal of the guidelines Provide guidance to HIV care practitioners and others on the optimal prevention and management of HIV- related opportunistic infections (OIs) for adults and adolescents in the United States. Panel members The Panel is composed of co-editors who represent the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Disease Society of America (HIVMA/IDSA), plus Panel members with expertise in HIV clinical care, infectious disease management, and research. Co-editors are appointed by their respective agencies or organizations. Panel members are selected from government, academia, and the healthcare community by the co-editors and assigned to a working group for one or more of the guideline sections based on the member's area of subject matter expertise. Each working group is chaired by a Panel member selected by the co-chairs. Members serve on the Panel for a 3-year term, with an option to be reappointed for additional terms. Prospective Panel members may self-nominate at any time. When specific or unique subject matter expertise is required, the co-editors together with working group leaders may solicit advice from individuals with such specialized knowledge. The list of the current Panel members can be found in Appendix C. Financial disclosure and management of conflicts of interest All members of the Panel submit a written financial disclosure annually reporting any associations with manufacturers of drugs, vaccines, medical devices, or diagnostics used to manage HIV-related OIs. A list of these disclosures and their last update is available in Appendix C. The co-editors review each reported association for potential conflicts of interest and determine the appropriate action: disqualification from the Panel, disqualification or recusal from topic review and discussion, or no disqualification needed. A conflict of interest is defined as any direct financial interest related to a product addressed in the section of the guideline to which a Panel member contributes content. Financial interests include direct receipt by the Panel member of payments, gratuities, consultancies, honoraria, employment, grants, support for travel or accommodation, or gifts from an entity having a commercial interest in that product. Financial interests also include direct compensation for membership on an advisory board, data safety monitoring board, or speakers' bureau. Compensation and support provided to a Panel member's university or institution (e.g., grants, research funding) is not considered a conflict of interest. The co-editors strive to ensure that 50% or more of the members of each working group have no conflicts of interest. Users of the guidelinesHIV treatment providers Developer Panel on Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV\u2014a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC). Funding source The Office of AIDS Research (OAR), NIH Evidence collection The recommendations in the guidelines are based on studies published in peer-reviewed journals. On some occasions, particularly when new information may affect patient safety, unpublished data presented at major conferences or information prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or manufacturers (e.g., warnings to the public) may be used as evidence to revise the guidelines. Panel members of each working group are responsible for identifying relevant literature, conducting a systematic comprehensive review of that literature, and proposing updates to the guidelines based on the literature review. Method of synthesizing data and formulating recommendationsEach section of the guidelines is assigned to a working group of Panel members with expertise in the area of interest. The members of the working group synthesize the available data. Recommendations are reviewed and updated by each working group after an assessment of the quality and impact of the existing and any new data. Aspects of evidence that are considered include but are not necessarily limited to the type of study (e.g., case series, prospective cohort, randomized controlled trial), the quality and appropriateness of the methods, and the number of participants and effect sizes observed. Finally, all proposed recommendations and supporting evidence are reviewed by the co-editors, OAR, subject matter experts at CDC and HIVMA/IDSA before final approval and publication. Recommendation ratingRecommendations are rated according to the information in the table below, \"Rating System for Prevention and Treatment Recommendations,\" and accompanied, as needed, by explanatory text that reviews the evidence and the working group's assessment. All proposed changes are discussed during teleconferences and by email and then assessed by the Panel's co-editors and reviewed by OAR, CDC, and IDSA before being endorsed as official recommendations. Other guidelines These guidelines focus on prevention and treatment of HIV-related OIs for adults and adolescents. A separate guideline outlines similar recommendations for children who have HIV infection. These guidelines are available on the AIDSinfo website (https://aidsinfo.nih.gov). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV A-4How to Use the Information in these Guidelines Recommendations in this report address: 1. Preventing exposure to opportunistic pathogens; 2. Preventing disease; 3. Discontinuing primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; 4. Treating disease; 5. When to start ART in the setting of an acute OI; 6. Monitoring for adverse ef fects (including immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [IRIS]); 7. Managing treatment failure; 8. Preventing disease recurrence (secondary prophylaxis or chronic maintenance therapy); 9. Discontinuing secondary prophylaxis or chronic maintenance therapy after immune reconstitution; and 10. Special considerations during pregnancy . Recommendations are rated according to the criteria in the table, below, and accompanied, as needed, by explanatory text that reviews the evidence and the working group's assessment. In this system, the letters A, B, or C signify the strength of the recommendation for or against a preventive or therapeutic measure, and the Roman numerals I, II, or III indicate the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation. In cases where there are no data for the prevention or treatment of an OI based on studies conducted in persons with HIV , but there are data derived from studies in persons without HIV that could plausibly guide management of patients with HIV , the recommendation is rated II or III but is assigned A, B, or C depending on the strength of the recommendation. This document also includes tables in each section pertinent to the prevention and treatment of the OI(s) in that section, as well as eight summary tables at the end of the document ( Tables 1-8), a figure of the Guidelines Development Process, continued Topic Comment Update plan Each working group leader and the co-editors meet every 3 months by teleconference to review interim data that may warrant modification of the guidelines. Updates may be prompted by approvals of new drugs, vaccines, medical devices or diagnostics, by new information regarding indications or dosing, by new safety or efficacy data, or by other information that may affect prevention and treatment of HIV-related OIs. In the event of new data of clinical importance, the Panel may post an interim announcement on the AIDSinfo website (https://aidsinfo.nih.gov) pending update of the guidelines with the appropriate changes. Public comments A 2-week public comment period follows release of a guidelines update on the AIDSinfo website. Comments received are reviewed by the appropriate work group(s) and the co-editors determine whether revisions to the guidelines are indicated. The public may also submit comments to the Panel at any time at contactus@aidsinfo.nih.gov . Rating System for Prevention and Treatment Recommendations Strength of Recommendation Quality of Evidence for the Recommendation A: Strong recommendation for the statement I: One or more randomized trials with clinical outcomes and/or validated laborator y endpoints B: Moderate recommendation for the statement II: One or more well-designed, non-randomized trials or obser vational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes C: Optional recommendation for the statement III: Expert opinion Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV A-5latest Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices immunization recommendations adapted to adults and adolescents with HIV , and an appendix that summarizes recommendations pertinent to preventing exposure to opportunistic pathogens, including preventing exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (Appendix A).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-1Bacterial Enteric Infections (Last updated August 10, 2017; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Rates of Gram-negative bacterial enteric infections are at least 10-fold higher among HIV-infected adults than in the general population, but these rates decline when patients are treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). 1-7 The risk of bacterial diarrhea varies according to CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count and is greatest in individuals with clinical AIDS or <200 CD4 cells/mm3.5 The bacteria most frequently isolated by culture from HIV-infected adults in the United States are Salmonella (particularly Salmonella E. coli , may contribute to the burden of diarrheal disease,8 but their role is poorly understood because diagnosis remains a research-only test. Clostridium difficile -associated infection (CDI) is suggest that low CD4 count (<50 cells/mm3) is an independent disease risk factor in addition to the traditional risk factors such as exposure to a health care facility or to antibiotics. Incidence of community-onset CDI is increasing and health care providers should also consider CDI in the evaluation of outpatient diarrheal illnesses in HIV-infected individuals. Data on Helicobacter pylori infection in HIV infection are limited and do not suggest excess risk in HIV-infected individuals. Other enteric infections that may cause diarrhea, such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and cytomegalovirus, are discussed elsewhere in these guidelines. As with bacterial enteric infections in HIV-uninfected persons, the probable source for most enteric infections in HIV-infected patients is ingestion of contaminated food or water. 3 Sexual activity with the potential for direct or indirect fecal-oral exposure also increases risk of infections, especially with Shigella10 and Campylobacter11 (see Appendix for further details). HIV-associated alterations in mucosal immunity or intestinal integrity and treatment with acid-suppressive agents may increase risk of enteric bacterial infections. Clinical Manifestations The three major clinical syndromes of infection with Gram-negative enteric bacteria among HIV-infected patients are: Self-limited gastroenteritis; More severe and prolonged diarrheal disease, potentially associated with fever , bloody diarrhea, and weight loss; and Bacteremia associated with extra-intestinal involvement, with or without concurrent or preceding gastrointestinal (GI) illness.12-15 Severe community-associated diarrhea is often defined as 6 loose stools (loose stool is defined as defecated material that takes the shape of a container) per day with or without other signs of disease such as fecal blood, orthostatic hypotension, or fever. In HIV-infected patients, the risk of more profound illness increases with the degree of immunosuppression. 1,3,4,16 Relapses in infection with Salmonella and other Gram-negative bacterial enteric pathogens after appropriate treatment have been well documented in HIV-infected patients.17-19 Diagnosis Assessment of patients with diarrhea should include a complete exposure history (see below); a medication review, because diarrhea is a common side effect of some ART and antibiotics; quantification of the diarrheal illness by stool frequency, volume, duration, and presence of blood; and associated signs and symptoms, such as presence and duration of fever. Physical examination should include measurement of temperature and Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-2assessment of volume and nutritional status. The diagnosis of Gram-negative bacterial enteric infection is established through cultures of stool and blood. Stool cultures are required to obtain antibiotic sensitivity testing for isolated enteric pathogens. Thus, stool cultures are preferred over or in addition to molecular diagnostics in HIV-infected patients given increasing resistance detected in enteric bacterial infections. Because incidence of bacteremia associated with Salmonella gastroenteritis is high in HIV-infected individuals, particularly those with advanced disease, blood cultures should be obtained from any patient with diarrhea and fever. For shigellosis, blood cultures may be helpful but are less likely to be positive than in salmonellosis. Other infections for which HIV-infected patients are at risk, albeit at a lower rate, are non- jejuni non-coli Campylobacter described as Campylobacter spp. Blood culture systems will typically grow these bacteria, but they are unlikely to be identified on routine stool cultures performed by most laboratories because growing these fastidious organisms requires special stool culture conditions. A stool sample for C. difficile toxin or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay should be routinely performed for patients with diarrhea who have recently received or are currently receiving antibiotics (including antimicrobial prophylaxis) or cancer chemotherapy, those who have been hospitalized in the past 4 to 6 weeks (or are currently hospitalized), those who reside in a long-term care facility, those with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3, those taking acid-suppressive medications, and those with moderate-to-severe community- acquired diarrhea.20 The most commonly used toxin tests are enzyme immunoassays that suffer from low sensitivity. PCR assays or glutamate dehydrogenase antigen enzyme immunoassays (which must be combined with a second confirmatory test for stool toxin) are recommended for testing. 21 However, only diarrheal stool samples should be tested for C. difficile to limit detection of asymptomatic colonization. Regardless of the test used, the diagnosis of CDI can only be made through careful selection of the correct population for testing and a correlation of clinical and laboratory findings. Endoscopy should generally be reserved for patients in whom stool culture, microscopy, C. difficile toxin assay, and blood culture fail to reveal an etiology or in whom treatment for an established diagnosis fails. Endoscopy with biopsy may be required for diagnosing etiologies other than bacterial enteric infections, including cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, cytomegalovirus or MAC gastroenteritis, and noninfectious causes of GI symptoms. Clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Some sexually transmitted rectal infections (e.g., proctitis due to lymphogranuloma venereum or Neisseria gonorrhoeae) can produce symptoms similar to those seen with colitis due to Salmonella, Shigella , and Campylobacter spp. If stool cultures fail to yield enteric bacterial pathogens in patients with symptoms of proctitis or colitis, diagnostic evaluation for STDs with anoscopy, culture, and biopsy should be considered. Preventing Exposure Multiple epidemiologic exposures can place patients at risk of enteric illnesses. The most common are ingestion of contaminated food or water and fecal-oral exposures (detailed prevention recommendations related to food and water exposures, pet exposures, and travel-related exposures can be found in the Appendix). Providing advice and education about such exposures is the responsibility of the health care provider. A patient's clinical condition and CD4 count can help the provider determine what prevention recommendations are most appropriate. Patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3 or a history of AIDS-defining illness22 are at the greatest risk of enteric illnesses;5 however, excess risk of undetermined magnitude or duration may persist in those with lesser degrees of immune impairment, including individuals treated with ART. Patients should be advised to regularly wash their hands with soap and water or alcohol-based cleansers to reduce the risk of enteric infection (AIII) . With regard to preventing enteric infection, soap and water are Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-3preferred over alcohol-based cleansers, which do not kill C. difficile spores and are only partially active against norovirus and Cryptosporidium (AIII) . HIV-infected patients should be advised to wash their hands after potential contact with human feces (e.g., as through defecation, cleaning feces from infants, or contact with a person who has diarrhea), after handling pets or other animals, after gardening or other contact with soil, before preparing food and eating, and before and after sex (AIII) . HIV-infected patients should avoid unprotected sex practices, such as anal sex and oral-anal contact that could result in oral exposure to feces and, in addition to handwashing, they should be advised to use barriers such as dental dams during sex to reduce exposures when possible (AIII) . Preventing Disease Antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent bacterial enteric illness is usually not recommended, including for travelers (AIII) . Prophylactic antimicrobial treatment can elicit adverse reactions, promote the emergence of resistant organisms, and increase risk of CDI. In rare cases, however, antimicrobial prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones or rifaximin can be considered, such as for immunosuppressed travelers, depending on their level of immunosuppression, the region of travel, and the trip's duration (CIII) . For pregnant women and patients already taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (such as for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis), TMP-SMX may offer limited protection against travelers' diarrhea as an alternative to fluoroquinolones or rifaximin (BIII). Risk of toxicity should be considered before prophylaxis with TMP- SMX is initiated solely because of travel. Treating Disease Empiric Therapy In most situations, treatment of diarrheal disease in HIV-infected patients does not differ significantly from that in immunocompetent individuals. Decisions on therapy are based on an assessment of diarrhea severity and hydration status. Patients should be informed of the importance of maintaining hydration and be given oral or intravenous (IV) rehydration, if indicated (AIII) . Because diarrheal disease can produce temporary malabsorption or lactose intolerance, consuming a bland diet and avoiding fat, dairy, and complex carbohydrates also are likely to be useful (BIII). The effectiveness and safety of probiotics or antimotility agents have not been adequately studied in HIV-infected patients with diarrheal illnesses. 23 Antimotility agents should be avoided if there is concern about inflammatory diarrhea, including CDI (BIII). After obtaining stool samples for diagnostic evaluation, initiation and duration of empiric antimicrobial therapy depend upon the patient's CD4 count and clinical appearance. If stool samples are obtained, antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed to confirm and inform antibiotic choice. No further work-up may be necessary and no treatment other than oral rehydration may be required, for example, in patients with CD4 counts >500 cells/mm 3 who have had 1 to 2 days of loose stools without fever or blood. However, a short course of antibiotics may be indicated in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts of 200 to 500 cells/mm3 who have diarrhea severe enough to compromise quality of life or ability to work. Patients with advanced HIV disease (i.e., CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3 or concomitant AIDS-defining illness) and clinically severe diarrhea (i.e., 6 liquid stools per day or bloody stools or a lower number of liquid stools per day but accompanied by fever or chills concerning for invasive bacterial disease) should undergo diagnostic evaluation to determine the etiology of the diarrheal illness and receive antimicrobial treatment. Empiric therapy with ciprofloxacin is reasonable (AIII). IV ceftriaxone or IV cefotaxime are reasonable alternatives (BIII). Therapy should be adjusted subsequently based on the results of the diagnostic work-up. Diarrhea that is persistent (i.e., lasting >14 days) in the absence of other clinical signs of severity, such as bloody stool or dehydration, should be evaluated and directed therapy should be started once a diagnosis is confirmed. Diarrhea is one of the most common illnesses affecting international travelers. Antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside the United States is an important public health problem. For example, traveler's diarrhea caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter jejuni in Southeast Asia is common. 24 Clinicians should consider the possibility of a resistant infection when prescribing empiric Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-4therapy for HIV-infected travelers who experience diarrhea or a syndrome consistent with a systemic infection while traveling or upon returning to the United States, given reports of multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae acquisition during travel. 25-29 Pathogen-Specific Therapy Salmonella spp. Immunocompetent hosts who are not HIV-infected often do not require treatment for Salmonella gastroenteritis, as the condition is usually self-limited and treatment may prolong the carrier state. In contrast, all HIV-infected patients with salmonellosis should be treated (AIII) , although no clinical trials have compared antimicrobial therapy with placebo. Notably, HIV infection increases the risk of Salmonella bacteremia 20- to 100-fold and mortality as much as 7-fold compared with that in patients who are not HIV-infected. 1,30 The initial treatment of choice for Salmonella infection is a fluoroquinolone (AIII) . Ciprofloxacin is the preferred fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, would likely be effective in treating salmonellosis in HIV-infected patients but they have not been well evaluated in clinical studies (BIII). Depending on antibiotic susceptibility, alternatives to the fluoroquinolones might include TMP-SMX or expanded-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone cefotaxime (BIII). The optimal duration of therapy for HIV-related Salmonella infection has not been defined. For patients with CD4 counts 200 cells/mm 3 who have mild gastroenteritis without bacteremia, 7 to 14 days of treatment is reasonable. For the same patients with bacteremia, 14 days is appropriate, provided clearance of bacteremia is documented. Longer treatment is suggested if bacteremia persists or if the infection is complicated, that is, if metastatic foci are present (BIII). For patients with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count <200 cells/mm 3), 2 to 6 weeks of antibiotics is often recommended (CIII) .32 Some patients with Salmonella bacteremia may remain febrile for 5 to 7 days despite effective therapy. HIV-infected patients with Salmonella bacteremia, which typically occurs in those with advanced HIV disease, should be monitored clinically for recurrence after treatment (BIII). Recurrence may present as bacteremia or as an anatomically localized infection, including intra-abdominal, endothelial, urinary tract, soft tissue, bone and joint, lung, or meningeal foci. Secondary prophylaxis should be considered for patients with recurrent Salmonella bacteremia (BIII) and it might also be considered for patients with recurrent gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) and in those with CD4 counts <200 cell/mm 3 with severe diarrhea (BIII). The value of this secondary prophylaxis has not been established and must be weighed against the risks of long-term antibiotic exposure. Recurrent Salmonella bacteremia constitutes an AIDS- defining illness33 and suppression of HIV replication with ART appears to decrease the risk of recurrent illnesses.34 In patients whose Salmonella infection is resolved and who have responded to ART with sustained viral suppression and CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3, secondary prophylaxis for salmonellosis can probably be stopped (CII).7 Clinicians also should be aware that recurrence may represent development of antimicrobial resistance during therapy. Shigella spp. Therapy for Shigella infections is recommended both to shorten the duration of illness and to possibly prevent spread of the infection to others (AIII).31 The recommended treatment for shigellosis is with a fluoroquinolone, preferably ciprofloxacin, for 7 to 10 days (AIII). Although current CLSI criteria categorizes Shigella isolates with MIC 0.12-1 ug/ml as susceptible, these isolates may harbor plasmid-mediated resistance genes. Until the clinical significance of these findings can be determined, fluoroquinolones should only be used to treat isolates with MIC <0.12 ug/ml. 35 Ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei and S. flexneri have been reported in the United States and are associated with international travel, homelessness, and being a man who has sex with men (MSM); ciprofloxacin-resistant shigellosis among MSM appears to be acquired predominantly within the United States, rather than during travel. 29 Depending on antibiotic susceptibilities, alternative agents might include TMP-SMX (7-10 days) or azithromycin (5 days) (BIII). Azithromycin has Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-5not been evaluated in HIV-infected patients with shigellosis, and the therapy suggested is extrapolated from limited data in immunocompetent hosts.36 Recently, azithromycin-resistant Shigella spp in Treatment for patients with Shigella bacteremia is less well defined, but extending treatment to at least 14 days is reasonable (BIII). Azithromycin is not recommended for treatment of Shigella spp. bacteremia (AIII). Chronic suppressive or maintenance therapy is not recommended for first-time Shigella infections (BIII). Recurrent infections can occur, particularly in individuals with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3, in which case extending antimicrobial therapy for up to 6 weeks is reasonable (BIII). As with Salmonella infections, suppression of HIV replication with ART is expected to decrease the risk of recurrent shigellosis. Campylobacter spp. The optimal treatment of Campylobacteriosis in HIV-infected patients is poorly defined. Culture and testing for the antibiotic susceptibility of Campylobacter isolates is recommended (BIII). Rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents differs by Campylobacter species. In the United States in 2013, 22% of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolone and 2% were resistant to azithromycin; among C. coli isolates, 35% of isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and 17% were resistant to azithromycin.40 For patients with mild disease and CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3, some clinicians opt to withhold therapy unless symptoms persist for more than several days (CIII) . For mild-to-moderate Campylobacteriosis, initiating therapy with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin for 7 to 10 days (if the organism is sensitive) or azithromycin for 5 days is a reasonable approach (BIII). Azithromycin has not been evaluated in HIV-infected patients with Campylobacteriosis and the therapy suggested is extrapolated from limited data in immunocompetent hosts. 41 Patients with Campylobacter bacteremia should be treated for at least 14 days using a fluoroquinolone if the isolate is sensitive (BIII). Azithromycin is not recommended for treatment of Campylobacter bacteremia (AIII) . Adding a second active agent, such as an aminoglycoside, may be prudent in these patients to limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance (BIII). Antibiotic choice should be guided by antibiotic susceptibility tests. Chronic suppressive or maintenance therapy is not recommended for first-time Campylobacter infections in HIV-infected patients (BIII). However, recurrent infections can occur, particularly in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3. In recurrent disease, extending the length of antimicrobial therapy for 2 to 6 weeks is reasonable (BIII). As with Salmonella infections, suppression of HIV replication with ART is expected to decrease the risk of recurrent Campylobacter spp. infections. Clostridium difficile Available data suggest that HIV-infected patients respond to treatment of CDI similarly to HIV-uninfected patients. Guidelines and subsequent updates to guide the treatment of CDI have been published42-45 and can be consulted for further information. Multivariate analysis of 2 recent identical, multicenter (91 sites in United States, Canada; 109 sites in Europe), randomized, double-blind studies involving 537 non-HIV-infected patients with CDI (278 and 259 treated with metronidazole and vancomycin, respectively) found vancomycin to be superior to metronidazole for clinical success [OR 1.575 (1.035, 2.396), found 4.0% (mild), 8.3% (moderate), and 12.2% (severe) improved clinical success rates with vancomycin therapy compared to metronidazole therapy. 46 Given this trial and earlier data,47 vancomycin (AI) is recommended for treatment of HIV-infected persons with CDI with the possible exception of mild CDI where treatment with metronidazole (CII) may yield clinical success. Treatment of recurrent CDI in HIV-infected patients is the same as in patients who are not HIV-infected. Limited case reports suggest that fecal microbiota therapy (aka fecal transplant) may be successful and safe to treat recurrent CDI in HIV-infected patients (CIII). 48 The impact of ART on recurrence of CDI is unknown. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART ART initiation should follow standard guidelines. The presence of a diarrheal illness is relevant only in terms of a patient's ability to ingest and absorb ART. If recurrent enteric infections are documented or Salmonella bacteremia occurs, prompt initiation of ART should be considered regardless of CD4 count; in other words, the presence of an enteric infection should not delay ART initiation (BIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-6Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Patients should be monitored closely for response to treatment, defined clinically by improvement in systemic signs and symptoms, resolution of diarrhea, and sterilization of infected tissues or body fluids such as blood. A follow-up stool culture to demonstrate clearance of the organism is not required if clinical symptoms and diarrhea resolve. Follow-up stool culture may be required when public health considerations and state law dictate the need to ensure micro\u00acbiologic cure, such as in health care or food service workers. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has not been described in association with treatment for bacterial enteric pathogens. Managing Treatment Failure Follow-up stool culture should be considered for patients who fail to respond clinically to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In patients with persistent or recurrent diarrhea despite therapy, clinicians should consider other enteric infections in the context of the patient's immune status and, in all cases, the possibility of C. difficile or the development of antimicrobial resistance. Observational studies suggest that plasma drug concentrations (e.g., of ciprofloxacin) in HIV-infected patients may be decreased as a result of diarrhea or malabsorption. 49,50 Coadministration of quinolones with magnesium- or aluminum-containing antacids or with calcium, zinc, or iron should be avoided because these interfere with drug absorption. Although larger prospective studies are needed to determine the impact of severe diarrhea on antibiotic absorption, it is prudent to use IV antibiotics in clinically unstable patients (AIII). Preventing Recurrence The pharmacologic approach to recurrent enteric infections is covered in the section on directed therapy for each bacterial species. As noted above, secondary prophylaxis should be considered for patients with recurrent Salmonella bacteremia (BIII) and, in some circumstances, for those with recurrent shigellosis (BIII) or Campylobacteriosis (BIII). Special Considerations During Pregnancy The diagnosis of bacterial enteric infection in pregnant women is the same as in women who are not pregnant. Bacterial enteric infections in pregnant women should be managed the same as in women who are not pregnant, with several considerations. Based on the safety profile, expanded-spectrum cephalosporins or azithromycin should be the first-line therapy for bacterial enteric infections during pregnancy if antimicrobials are required, depending on the organism and the results of susceptibility testing (BIII). 51 Arthropathy has been noted in the offspring of animals treated with quinolones during pregnancy. However, studies evaluating quinolone use in pregnant women did not find an increased risk of birth defects or musculoskeletal abnormalities. 52-54 Thus, quinolones can be used in pregnancy for bacterial enteric infections in HIV-infected pregnant women if indicated by susceptibility testing or failure of first-line therapy, as listed above (BIII). TMP-SMX use in the first trimester should be avoided, if possible, because of an association with an increased risk of birth defects, specifically neural tube, cardiovascular, and urinary tract defects (BIII). 55,56,57 However, a recent review of potential risks related to TMP-SMX use cites the low quality of current data and supports use of TMP-SMX in HIV-infected pregnant women as clinically indicated.58 Neonatal care providers should be informed if maternal sulfa therapy was used near delivery because of the theoretical increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in the newborn. Since rifaximin is not systemically absorbed, it can be used in pregnancy as in non-pregnant individuals. Limited data are available on the risks of vancomycin use during pregnancy, however minimal absorption is expected with oral therapy. With intravenous use, vancomycin readily crosses the placenta. 59 A study of 10 infants evaluated after second or third trimester in utero exposure from maternal intravenous vancomycin therapy for serious staphylococcal infections found no hearing loss or renal toxicity attributed to vancomycin. 60 A recent review of metronidazole use in pregnancy for treatment of trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis found no increase in risk of birth defects. 61 Studies on use for CDI in pregnancy were not found. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-7Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Bacterial Enteric Infections (page 1 of 3) Preventing Bacterial Enteric Illness Antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent bacterial enteric illness usually is not recommended, including for travelers (AIII). In rare cases, such as for immunosuppressed travelers, depending on their level of immunosuppression, the region of travel, a nd the trip's duration, antimicrobial prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones or rifaximin can be considered (CIII). For pregnant women and patients already on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia TMP-SMX may offer limited protection against travelers' diarrhea as an alternative to fluoroquinolone or rifaximin (BIII). General Considerations when Managing Patients with Bacterial Enteric Infections Oral or IV rehydration therapy (if indicated) should be given to patients with diarrhea (AIII). Antimotility agents should be avoided if there is concern about inflammatory diarrhea, including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) (BIII). Diagnostic fecal specimens should be obtained prior to initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy. If stool sample is obtained, antibiotic susceptibilities should be per formed to confirm and inform antibiotic choice given increased reports of antibiotic resistance. Risk of a bacterial enteric infection increases as CD4 count declines, with the greatest risk in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/ mm3. Risk of bacteremia also increases with decreasing CD4 count. If no clinical response after 3 to 4 days, consider follow-up stool culture with antibiotic susceptibility testing and other methods to detect enteric pathogens (e.g., toxin assays, molecular methods), alternative diagnosis, antibiotic resistance, or drug-drug interactions. Effective ART may reduce the frequency, severity, and recurrence of bacterial enteric infections. Empiric Treatment of Bacterial Enteric Infections (Pending Diagnostic Studies) For patients with advanced HIV (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or concomitant AIDS-defining illnesses) and clinically severe diarrhea (6 liquid stools/day or bloody stool and/or accompanying fever or chills). Preferred Therapy: Ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) Therapy: Ceftriaxone q8h (BIII) Note: IV antibiotic therapy with hospitalization should be considered in patients with marked nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, blood pressure instability, and/or when clinical judgment indicates severity of disease. For patients with persistent diarrhea (>14 days) but no other severe clinical signs (e.g., dehydration, blood in stool), antibiotic therapy can be withheld until a diagnosis is confirmed. Diarrhea is a common illness of international travelers. Antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside the United States is common. Clinicians should consider the possibility of resistant infections when prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for HIV-infected travelers while traveling or upon return to the United States, particularly among travelers to South and Southeast Asia. Treating Salmonellosis All HIV-infected patients with salmonellosis should receive antibiotic treatment due to the increased risk of bacteremia (by 20-100-fold) and mortality (by as much as 7-fold) compared with HIV-negative individuals (AIII). Preferred Therapy for Salmonella Gastroenteritis With or Without Bacteremia: Ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) q12h (AIII) Alternative Therapy: Levofloxacin 750 mg (PO or IV) q24h (BIII), or Moxifloxacin 400 mg (PO or IV) q24h (BIII) If susceptible, alternatives to fluoroquinolone may include 1 of the following: Trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg (PO q8h (BIII) Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV B-8Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Bacterial Enteric Infections (page 2 of 3) Treating Salmonellosis, continued Duration of Therapy for Gastroenteritis Without Bacteremia primary illness was severe: 2-6 weeks (BIII) Duration of Therapy for If CD4 count >200 cells/mm3: 14 days; longer duration if bacteremia persists or if the infection is complicated (e.g., metastatic foci of infection are present) (BIII) cells/mm3: 2-6 weeks (BIII) Secondary ProphylaxisThe role of long-term, secondary prophylaxis for patients with recurrent bacteremia or gastroenteritis is not well established. Clinicians must weigh the benefit against the risks of long-term antibiotic exposure (BIII). Antibiotic choices for secondary prophylaxis are the same as for primary treatment and are dependent on the sensitivity of the Salmonella isolate. Suppression of HIV replication with ART is expected to decrease the risk of recurrent illnesses.Clinicians should be aware that recurrence may represent development of antimicrobial resistance during therapy. Some Experts Recommend Secondary Prophylaxis for: Patients with recurrent bacteremia, or Patients with recurrent gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) with CD4 count <200 cells/mm 3 and severe diarrhea (CIII) When to Stop Secondary Prophylaxis: After resolution of Salmonella infection and response to ART with sustained viral suppression and CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 (CII) Treating Shigellosis Therapy is indicated to shorten the duration of illness and to possibly prevent spread to others (AIII) . However, given increasing antimicrobial resistance and limited data demonstrating that antibiotic therapy limits transmission, antibiotic treatment may be withheld in HIV-infected patients with CD4 >500 cells/mm3 whose diarrhea resolves prior infection (CIII) . Preferred Therapy: Ciprofloxacin 500-750 IV) q12h if MIC<0.12 ug/ml (see Note) (AIII) Alternative Therapy (Depending on Susceptibility Results): Levofloxacin 750 mg (PO or IV) q24h (BIII) , or Moxifloxacin (PO or IV) 400 mg q24h (BIII) or Trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg PO or IV q12h (BIII) or Azithromycin 500 mg PO daily for 5 days (BIII) (Note: Azithromycin is not Gastroenteritis: for 5 days) Bacteremia: 14 days (BIII) Recurrent infections: up to 6 weeks (BIII) Chronic Maintenance or Suppressive Therapy: Not recommended for first-time infections (BIII) Note: Increased resistance of Shigella to fluoroquinolones is occurring in the United States. Avoid treating Shigella with fluoroquinolones if ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 ug/ml even if the laboratory identifies the isolate as sensitive. Many Shigella strains resistant to fluoroquinolones exhibit resistance to other commonly used antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic sensitivity testing of Shigella isolates from HIV-infected individuals should be performed routinely. Treating Campylobacteriosis Optimal treatment is poorly defined. There is an increasing rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in the United States (22% resistance in 2013 among C. jejuni isolates). Antimicrobial therapy should be modified based on susceptibility reports. Mild Disease if CD4 Count >500 cells/mm 3: If diarrhea resolves prior to culture confirmation of Campylobacter infection, antibiotic treatment can be withheld (CIII). If symptoms persist, consider antibiotic therapy (CIII).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV C-1Bartonellosis (Last updated May 7, 2013; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Bartonella species cause infections that include cat scratch disease, retinitis, trench fever, peliosis hepatis.1 The latter two manifestations occur only in individuals who are immunocompromised. BA is caused by either Bartonella quintana or Bartonella henselae .1,2 Twenty-four species and three subspecies of Bartonella have been isolated and are officially recognized ( http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/b/bartonella.html ), and eight have been isolated from humans. However, only B. henselae and B. quintana infections have been identified in HIV- infected patients.2 BA most often occurs late in HIV infection, in patients with median CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts <50 cells/mm3.2 In HIV-infected patients, bartonellosis is often a chronic illness, lasting for months to years, with BA lesions and intermittent bacteremia. Development of BA lesions caused by B. henselae is statistically linked to cat exposure in patients with HIV infection.2 In contrast, BA caused by B. quintana is associated with body louse infestation and homelessness.2 The body louse serves as the vector of B. quintana in humans. To avoid exposure to B. quintana, HIV-infected patients should avoid body lice and, if infected, treat the infestation. The cat flea is the vector of B. henselae in cats. Cats are the most common vector (via a scratch) responsible for transmitting B. henselae to humans, most likely when their claws become contaminated with feces from B. henselae-infected fleas. In some areas of the United States, the prevalence of B. henselae bacteremia in pet cats approaches 50%.3 Control of cat flea infestation and avoidance of cat scratches are therefore critical strategies for preventing B. henselae infections in patients who are HIV infected. Clinical Manifestations BA lesions have been associated with nearly every organ system, but cutaneous lesions are the most readily identified. These lesions can be clinically indistinguishable from Kaposi sarcoma, pyogenic granuloma, and other skin conditions. BA also can cause subcutaneous nodules. Osteomyelitis is usually caused by B. quintana, and only B. henselae can cause bacillary peliosis hepatis. Although isolated organs can appear to be the principal focus of disease, BA represents a hematogenously disseminated infection, and systemic symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss often accompany BA. Bartonella infection is a major cause of unexplained fever in patients with late-stage AIDS and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and CD4 counts <100 cells/mm 3.4 Bartonella is a relatively common cause of culture- negative endocarditis in immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans and is most commonly caused by B. quintana and, less frequently, B. henselae. 5 Diagnosis Diagnosis can be confirmed by histopathologic examination of biopsied tissue.6 BA lesions are characterized by vascular proliferation, and a modified silver stain (such as Warthin-Starry stain) usually demonstrates numerous bacilli. Tissue Gram staining and acid-fast staining are negative. A well-characterized serologic test was developed at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 7 and is also available at some state health labs. In addition, several private laboratories offer serological testing, but none of these private laboratory tests has been evaluated for sensitivity or specificity with sera from HIV-infected patients with culture-documented Bartonella infection. In immunocompetent patients, anti- Bartonella antibodies might not be detectable for 6 weeks after acute infection; in contrast, by the time Bartonella infection is suspected in patients with late-stage HIV infection, they usually have been infected for months or even >1 year. Note that as many as 25% of Bartonella culture-positive patients never develop antibodies in the setting of advanced HIV infection. 4 In those patients who do develop anti- Bartonella antibodies, monitoring of antibody levels can correlate with resolution and recrudescence of Bartonella infection. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV C-2Bartonella species can be isolated (with difficulty) from blood, using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. The organisms have been isolated from tissue in only a few laboratories because of the fastidious nature of Bartonella .2 Polymerase chain reaction methods have been developed for identification and speciation of Bartonella but are not widely available. Preventing Exposure HIV-infected patients, specifically those who are severely immunocompromised (CD4 counts <100 cells/mm 3), are at high risk of severe disease when infected by B. quintana and B. henselae . The major risk factors for acquisition of B. henselae are contact with cats infested with fleas and receiving cat scratches. Immunocompromised individuals should consider the potential risks of cat ownership (AIII) . Patients who want cats should acquire animals that are older than age 1 year and in good health (BII). Cats should be acquired from a known environment, have a documented health history, and be free of fleas. Stray cats and cats with flea infestation should be avoided. Declawing is not advised, but HIV-infected individuals should avoid rough play with cats and situations in which scratches are likely (AII). Patients should avoid contact with flea feces (i.e., flea dirt), and any cat-associated wound should be washed promptly with soap and water (BIII). Care of cats should include a comprehensive, ongoing flea-control program under the supervision of a veterinarian (BIII). No evidence indicates any benefits to cats or their owners from routine culture or serologic testing of the pet for Bartonella infection or from antibiotic treatment of healthy, serologically positive cats (BII). The major risk factor for B. quintana infection is body lice infestation. Patients who are homeless or in marginal housing should be informed that body louse infestation can be associated with serious illness and provided with appropriate measures to eradicate body lice, if present (AII). Preventing Disease Primary chemoprophylaxis for Bartonella -associated disease is not recommended (BIII). However, note that in a retrospective case-control study, Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis using a macrolide or rifamycin was protective against developing Bartonella infection.2 Treating Disease All HIV-infected patients with Bartonella infection should receive antibiotic treatment (AII). Guidelines for treatment of Bartonella infections have been published.8 No randomized, controlled clinical trials have evaluated antimicrobial treatment of bartonellosis in HIV-infected patients. Erythromycin and doxycycline have been used successfully to treat BA, peliosis hepatis, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis and are considered first-line treatment for bartonellosis on the basis of reported experience in case series (AII). 1,2 Therapy should be administered for 3 months (AII). Doxycycline, with or without a rifamycin, is the treatment of choice for bartonellosis infection involving the central nervous system (CNS) (AIII) . For severe Bartonella infections, combination therapy using or doxycycline with a rifamycin is recommended (BIII); intravenous therapy may be needed initially (AIII) . Treatment of confirmed Bartonella endocarditis should include doxycycline with the addition of gentamicin for 2 weeks (if tolerated); a rifamycin can be substituted for gentamicin in the setting of renal insufficiency (BII). 8 Clarithromycin or azithromycin treatment has been associated with clinical response and either of these can be an alternative therapy Bartonella infections (except for endocarditis or CNS infections) (BIII). Azithromycin is recommended for patients who are less likely to comply with the more frequent dosing schedule for doxycycline or erythromycin. A third-generation cephalosporin, ceftizoxime, 9 was used successfully to treat Bartonella in a pregnant HIV-infected woman, but because there are no other data, a macrolide is the drug of first choice. Penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins have no in vivo activity and should not be used for treatment of bartonellosis (BII). Quinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) have variable in vitro activity and an inconsistent clinical response in case reports and are not recommended (BIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV C-3Special Consideration with Regard to Starting ART Antiretroviral-naive patients with Bartonella CNS or ophthalmic lesions should probably be treated with doxycycline and a rifamycin for 2 to 4 weeks before instituting antiretroviral therapy (CIII) . Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Effects (Including IRIS) Patients should have anti- Bartonella IgG antibody titers checked at the time of diagnosis and, if positive, should be followed with sequential titers every 6 to 8 weeks until a four-fold decrease is documented. This test is available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several large commercial labs. Patients treated with oral doxycycline should be cautioned about pill-associated ulcerative esophagitis that occurs most often when a dose is taken with only a small amount of liquid or at night just before retiring. 10 Photosensitivity also can occur during doxycycline treatment. Adverse effects associated with macrolides include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and elevations of liver transaminase levels. Serious side effects can occur during treatment with rifamycins, including hypersensitivity reactions (including thrombocytopenia, interstitial nephritis, and hemolytic anemia), and Administration of rifamycins strongly induces the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which is an important consideration when other medications, including many ARV drugs, are taken simultaneously. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has not been described in association with Bartonellosis and treatment with ART in HIV-infected persons. Managing Treatment Failure Among patients who fail to respond to initial treatment, 1 or more of the second-line alternative regimens should be considered (AIII) , again with treatment duration of 3 months. For patients with positive or increasing antibody titers, treatment should continue until a fourfold decrease is documented. Preventing Recurrence If a relapse occurs after a minimum 3-month course of primary treatment, long-term suppression of infection with doxycycline or a macrolide is recommended, as long as the CD4 count remains <200 cells/mm 3 (AIII) . Long-term suppression can be discontinued after the patient has received at least 3 to 4 months of therapy and when the CD4 count remains >200 cells/mm 3 for 6 months (CIII). Some specialists would discontinue therapy only if the Bartonella titers have also decreased by four-fold (CIII). Special Considerations During Pregnancy Infection with Bartonella bacilliformis in immunocompetent patients during pregnancy has been associated with increased complications and risk of death.11 No data are available on the effect of B. henselae or B. quintana infections in pregnant women with concomitant HIV infection. The approach to diagnosis of Bartonella infections in pregnant women is the same as in non-pregnant women. Erythromycin treatment should be used (AIII) rather than tetracyclines during pregnancy because of the increased risk of hepatotoxicity and the accumulation of tetracycline in fetal teeth and bones, resulting in dark, permanent staining of fetal teeth. Third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftizoxime9 or ceftriaxone may have efficacy against Bartonella in pregnant women who are HIV infected, but it should be considered second-line therapy after a macrolide. First- and second-generation cephalosporins are not recommended because of their lack of efficacy against Bartonella (AII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV C-4Recommendations for Treating Bartonella Infections Preferred Hepatis, Osteomyelitis: or IV q12h (AII), or Erythromycin 500 mg PO or IV q6h (AII) For Infections Involving the CNS: Doxycycline 100 mg PO or IV q12h +/- rifampin 300 mg PO or IV q12h Bartonella Endocarditis: (Doxycycline + gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV q8h) x 2 weeks, then continue with doxycycline 100 mg IV or PO q12h (BII) , or For patients with renal insufficiency: (doxycycline 100 mg IV q12h + rifampin 300 mg IV or PO q12h) x 2 weeks, then continue with doxycycline 100 mg IV or PO q12h (BII) For Other Severe Infections Doxycycline 100 mg PO or IV q12h + rifampin 300 mg PO or IV q12h (BIII), or Erythromycin 500 mg PO or IV q6h + rifampin 300 mg PO or IV q12h (BIII) Alternative Therapy for Bartonella Infections (Not for Endocarditis or CNS Infections): Azithromycin 500 mg PO daily (BIII), or Clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID (BIII) Duration of Therapy: At least 3 months Indication for Long-Term Suppressive Therapy If a relapse occurs after a 3 month course of primary treatment: A macrolide or doxycycline as long as the CD4 count remains <200 cells/mm3 (AIII) Indications for Discontinuing Long-Term Suppressive Therapy (CIII): Received at least 3 to 4 months of treatment; and CD4 count >200 cells/mm 3 for at least 6 months Some specialists would only discontinue therapy if Bartonella titers have also decreased by four-fold Other Considerations Rifampin is a potent hepatic enzyme inducer and may lead to significant interaction with many drugs; including ARV agents (see T able 5 for dosing recommendations) Key to Abbreviations: ARV = antiretroviral; BID daily; CD4 = CD4 T lymphocyte cell; CNS = system, IV = intravenously, PO = orally; q(n)h = every \"n\" hours References Spach DH, JE.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV D-1Candidiasis (Mucocutaneous) (Last updated May 26, 2020; last reviewed May 26, 2020) Epidemiology Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are common in patients with HIV infection.1,2 The vast majority of such infections are caused by Candida albicans , although infections caused by non- C. albicans species have also been reported in recent years worldwide.3-6 The occurrence of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis is recognized as an indicator of immune suppression and is most often observed in patients with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <200 cells/mm3, with esophageal disease typically occurring at lower CD4 counts than oropharyngeal disease.1,2 In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis\u2014whether a single episode or recurrent\u2014is common in healthy, adult women and does not suggest HIV infection. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic decline in the prevalence of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and a marked diminution in cases of refractory disease. Fluconazole (or azole) resistance is predominantly the consequence of previous exposure to fluconazole (or other azoles), particularly repeated and long-term exposure. 7-9 In this setting, the vast majority of cases relate to acquisition of C. albican s resistance; however, prior exposure to azole therapy has also been associated with a gradual emergence of non- C. albicans species, particularly Candida glabrata, as a cause of refractory mucosal candidiasis in patients with advanced immunosuppression and low CD4 counts.7,10 Clinical Manifestations Oropharyngeal candidiasis is characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions that can occur on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, oropharyngeal mucosa, or tongue surface. Lesions can be easily scraped off with a tongue depressor or other instrument. Less commonly, erythematous patches without white plaques can be seen on the anterior or posterior upper palate or diffusely on the tongue. Angular cheilosis also can be caused by Candida. Because a proportion of patients with HIV who have oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement, clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; occasionally esophageal candidiasis can be asymptomatic. Endoscopic examination reveals whitish plaques similar to those observed with oropharyngeal disease. On occasion, the plaques may progress to superficial ulcerations of the esophageal mucosa with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In women with HIV infection, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity and sporadic recurrences. In women with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently. In contrast to oropharyngeal candidiasis, vulvovaginal candidiasis is less common and when it occurs, it is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non- C. albicans species. Diagnosis Oropharyngeal candidiasis is usually diagnosed clinically based on the characteristic appearance of lesions. In contrast to oral hairy leukoplakia, the white plaques of oropharyngeal candidiasis can be scraped off the mucosa. If laboratory confirmation is required, scrapings can be examined microscopically for characteristic yeast or hyphal forms, using a potassium hydroxide preparation. Cultures of clinical exudative material yield the species of Candida present. The diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis is often made empirically based on symptoms plus response to therapy, or visualization of lesions plus fungal smear or brushings without histopathologic examination. The definitive diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis requires direct endoscopic visualization of lesions with histopathologic demonstration of characteristic Candida yeast forms in tissue and confirmation by fungal Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV D-2culture and speciation. Vulvovaginal candidiasis usually is diagnosed based on the clinical presentation coupled with the demonstration of characteristic blastosphere and hyphal yeast forms in vaginal secretions when examined microscopically after potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture confirmation is rarely required but may provide supportive information. Self-diagnosis of vulvovaginitis is unreliable; microscopic and culture confirmation is required to avoid unnecessary exposure to treatment. Preventing Exposure Candida organisms are common commensals on mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals. No measures are available to reduce exposure to these fungi. Preventing Disease Data from prospective controlled trials indicate that fluconazole can reduce the risk of mucosal disease (i.e., oropharyngeal, esophageal, and vulvovaginal disease) in patients with advanced HIV . 11-14 However, routine primary prophylaxis is not recommended because mucosal disease is associated with very low attributable morbidity and mortality and, moreover, acute therapy is highly effective. Primary antifungal prophylaxis can lead to infections caused by drug-resistant Candida strains and introduce significant drug-drug interactions. In addition, long-term oral prophylaxis is expensive. Therefore, routine primary prophylaxis is not recommended (AIII) . Administration of ART and immune restoration is an effective means to prevent disease. Treating Disease Oropharyngeal Candidiasis Oral fluconazole is as effective as or superior to topical therapy for oropharyngeal candidiasis. In addition, oral therapy is more convenient than topical therapy and usually better tolerated. Moreover, oral therapy has the additional benefit over topical regimens in being efficacious in treating esophageal candidiasis. Oral fluconazole at 100 mg once a day is considered the drug of choice to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis except during pregnancy (AI). One to 2 weeks of therapy is recommended for oropharyngeal candidiasis; 2 to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended for esophageal disease. 15 Using topical agents to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis reduces systemic drug exposure, diminishes the risk of drug-drug interactions and systemic adverse events, and may reduce the likelihood that antifungal resistance develops. Unfavorable taste and multiple daily dosing, such as in the cases of clotrimazole and nystatin, may lead to decreased tolerability of topical therapy. As an alternative to oral fluconazole, once-daily miconazole to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (BI); these regimens were shown to be equivalent in a multicenter, randomized study. 16 Nystatin suspension or pastilles four times daily remains an additional alternative (BII).17 Topical, low-concentration gentian violet (0.00165%) applied twice daily may be an alternative, well-tolerated (i.e., without mucosal staining), and cost-effective regimen to nystatin suspension (BI). 18 Itraconazole oral solution for 7 to 14 days is as effective as oral fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis but less well tolerated (BI). 17 Posaconazole oral suspension19 is also as effective as fluconazole and generally better tolerated than itraconazole solution, although both posaconazole and itraconazole have more drug-drug interactions than fluconazole (BI). Both antifungals are alternatives to oral fluconazole, although few situations require that these drugs be used in preference to fluconazole solely to treat mucosal candidiasis. In a multicenter, randomized study, posaconazole was found to be more effective than fluconazole in sustaining clinical success after antifungal therapy was discontinued. 19 A new solid oral delayed-release tablet formulation of posaconazole, which exhibits less variable absorption than the oral suspension, is now available. 20 Whether it offers any advantage for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis is unknown, and it currently is indicated only for prophylaxis of invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections.21 Itraconazole Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV D-3capsules are less effective than fluconazole because of their more variable absorption, and they are associated with more drug-drug interactions than fluconazole. Esophageal Candidiasis Systemic antifungals are required for effective treatment of esophageal candidiasis (AI). A 14-day to 21- day course of either fluconazole (oral or intravenous [IV]) or oral itraconazole solution is highly effective (AI). However, patients with severe symptoms initially may have difficulty swallowing oral drugs. As with oropharyngeal candidiasis, itraconazole capsules for esophageal candidiasis are less effective than fluconazole because of variable absorption (CII). A 2-week course of the newer triazole isavuconazole, given orally at an initial loading dose of 200 mg, followed by 50 mg once daily; or a loading dose of 400 mg followed by 100 mg once daily; or 400 mg once weekly, is also as effective as fluconazole for uncomplicated esophageal candidiasis (BI); a higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse effects was seen with the 100-mg, once- daily isavuconazole regimen than with fluconazole and the isavuconazole regimens. 22 V oriconazole, amphotericin B (either deoxycholate formulations), and the echinocandins caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin all effectively treat esophageal candidiasis (BI); however, esophageal candidiasis appears to have a higher relapse rate after treatment with the echinocandins. 23,24 Therefore, oral or IV fluconazole remains the preferred therapy for esophageal candidiasis (AI). Although infection with other pathogens (e.g., cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus that causes esophagitis) can result in symptoms that mimic those of esophageal candidiasis, a diagnostic and therapeutic trial of antifungal therapy is usually warranted before endoscopy. In those who do not respond to antifungal therapy, endoscopy is recommended to identify different causes of esophagitis or drug-resistant Candida (AII). Vulvovaginal Candidiasis In most women with HIV infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis is uncomplicated and responds readily to short-course oral or topical treatment with any of several therapies, including: Oral fluconazole (AII) solution (BII ) Severe or recurrent episodes of vaginitis should be treated with oral fluconazole or topical antifungal therapy for 7 days (AII). For more information, see the Vulvovaginal Candidiasis section in the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting Antiretroviral Therapy There are no special considerations regarding initiation of ART in patients with mucocutaneous candidiasis. Specifically, there is currently no evidence that treatment with ART needs to be delayed until treatment for candidiasis has been completed. Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) For most patients with mucocutaneous candidiasis, response to antifungal therapy is rapid; signs and symptoms improve within 48 to 72 hours. Short courses of topical therapy rarely result in adverse effects, although patients may experience cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash and pruritus. Oral azole therapy can be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or transaminase elevations. Periodic monitoring of liver function studies should be considered if azole therapy is anticipated for >21 days, especially in patients with other hepatic comorbidities (AII). The echinocandins appear to be associated with very few adverse reactions: histamine-related infusion toxicity, transaminase elevations, and rash have been attributed to these drugs. No dose adjustments are required in renal failure. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with ART has not yet been reported for Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV D-4mucocutaneous candidiasis in patients with HIV infection. Indeed, ART is associated with a markedly reduced incidence of candidiasis. Managing Treatment Failure Antifungal treatment failure is typically defined as the persistence of signs or symptoms of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis after 7 to 14 days of appropriate antifungal therapy. Refractory disease occurs in approximately 4% to 5% of patients with HIV infection who have oral or esophageal candidiasis, typically those with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm 3 and who have received multiple courses of azole antifungals.8 Confirmatory culture and, in the case of esophageal candidiasis, endoscopy are necessary to confirm treatment failure due to azole resistance or other causes of esophagitis, especially if these procedures were not initially performed. Posaconazole immediate-release oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 28 days) is effective in 75% of patients with azole-refractory oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis (AI). 25 Again, although the new solid delayed-release tablet formulation of posaconazole has been recently made available, it is not known whether it offers an advantage over the suspension for treating this particular disease. Alternatively, oral itraconazole solution is effective, at least transiently, in approximately two-thirds of patients with fluconazole-refractory mucosal candidiasis (BII). 17 If necessary, azole-refractory esophageal candidiasis also can be treated with anidulafungin (BII), caspofungin (BII), micafungin (BII), or voriconazole (BII). IV amphotericin B is usually effective for treating refractory disease (BII). Both amphotericin B deoxycholate and the lipid preparations of amphotericin B have been used successfully (BII). Amphotericin B oral suspension (1 mL of the 100-mg/mL suspension four times daily) is sometimes effective in patients whose oropharyngeal candidiasis does not respond to itraconazole (BII), but this product is not commercially available in the United States. Preventing Recurrence When to Start Secondary Prophylaxis A randomized clinical trial14 in patients with HIV infection with CD4 counts <150 cells/mm3 documented significantly fewer episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis and other invasive fungal infections with continuous fluconazole therapy (three times a week) than with episodic fluconazole treatment for recurrences. This clinical trial also demonstrated no difference in the risk of developing clinically significant fluconazole resistance between the two groups among those receiving ART. However, secondary prophylaxis (chronic suppressive therapy) for recurrent oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis is not recommended by most HIV specialists unless patients have frequent or severe recurrences (BIII) because therapy for acute disease is effective, mortality associated with mucocutaneous disease is low, potential exists for drug interactions and for the development of antifungal-resistant Candida, and prophylaxis is costly. If recurrences are frequent or severe, oral fluconazole can be used as suppressive therapy for either oropharyngeal (BI), esophageal (BI), or vulvovaginal (BII) candidiasis. 11-13 Oral posaconazole twice daily is also effective for esophageal candidiasis (BII).26 The potential for development of secondary azole resistance should be considered when contemplating chronic maintenance therapy using azoles in patients with HIV infection who are severely immunocompromised. Several important factors should be considered when making the decision to use secondary prophylaxis. These factors include the effect of recurrences on the patient's well-being and quality of life, the need for prophylaxis against other fungal infections, cost, adverse events, and, most importantly, drug-drug interactions. 27 Rates of relapse are high in patients with azole-refractory oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis who have initially responded to echinocandins, voriconazole, or posaconazole therapy. In such patients, secondary prophylaxis should be instituted until ART produces immune reconstitution (AIII) . Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV D-5When to Stop Secondary Prophylaxis In situations where secondary prophylaxis has been instituted, no data exist to guide recommendations regarding its discontinuation. Based on experience with other opportunistic infections, it would be reasonable to discontinue secondary prophylaxis when the CD4 count has increased to >200 cells/mm 3 following initiation of ART (AIII) . Special Considerations During Pregnancy Pregnancy increases the risk of vaginal colonization with Candida species. Diagnosis of oropharyngeal, esophageal, and vulvovaginal candidiasis is the same in pregnant women as in those who are not pregnant. Topical therapy is preferable for treatment of oral candidiasis in pregnancy, but is essential for vulvovaginal candidiasis, especially during the first trimester. Data derived from women with vulvovaginal candidiasis suggest that fluconazole should not be used at any dose (including a single 150-mg dose) in the first trimester due to the risk of spontaneous abortion, while higher exposures (>150 mg dosing) during the first trimester are associated with cardiac septal closure defects. 28-32 A recent analysis of registry data from Sweden and Denmark did not find any increase in stillbirth or neonatal death associated with exposure to fluconazole at any dose during pregnancy. 33 Five cases of a syndrome consisting of craniosynostosis, characteristic facies, digital synostosis, and limb contractures (fluconazole embryopathy) have been reported in women chronically prescribed fluconazole at doses of 400 mg daily or higher in pregnancy. 30 A report from a national cohort register in Denmark found an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.23-1.77) for spontaneous pregnancy loss with any exposure to oral fluconazole from 7 to 22 weeks of pregnancy compared to unexposed, matched controls. 31 An increased HR of 1.47 (95% CI, 1.22-1.77) was also noted with low-dose (150-300 mg cumulative dose) exposure. No increase in stillbirth was seen with fluconazole exposure broadly, but an increase in risk of stillbirth (HR, 4.10; CI 95%, 1.89-8.90) was noted with fluconazole doses >300 mg. Based on these data, substitution of amphotericin B for fluconazole in the first trimester is recommended for invasive or refractory esophageal candidal infections (AIII) . Neonates born to women receiving chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. Itraconazole at high doses has been shown to be teratogenic in animals, but the metabolic mechanism accounting for these defects is not present in humans, so the data supporting this finding may not be applicable to human pregnancy. Case series in humans do not suggest an increased risk of birth defects with itraconazole, 34 but experience is limited. Human data are not available for posaconazole; however, the drug was associated with skeletal abnormalities in rats and was embryotoxic in rabbits when given at doses that produced plasma levels equivalent to those seen humans. Evidence is inconclusive or inadequate for determining fetal risk associated with voriconazole use during pregnancy. An association with cleft palate and renal defects has been seen in rats, as well as embryotoxicity seen in rabbits. Human data on the use of voriconazole are not available, so its use is not recommended. In animals, multiple anomalies have been seen with exposure to micafungin, and ossification defects have been seen with the use of anidulafungin and caspofungin. 35 Human data are not available for these drugs, thus their use in human pregnancy is not recommended (AIII). Chemoprophylaxis, either chronic maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis, against oropharyngeal, esophageal, or vaginal candidiasis using systemically absorbed azoles should not be initiated during pregnancy (AIII). Furthermore, prophylaxis with systemic azoles should be discontinued in women with HIV who become pregnant (AIII) .

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV E-1Chagas Disease (Last updated August 8, 2018; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted to humans by infected triatomine bugs, and less commonly by transfusion, organ transplant, from mother to infant, and in rare instances, by ingestion of contaminated food or drink.1-4 The hematophagous triatomine vectors defecate during or immediately after feeding on a person. The parasite is present in large numbers in the feces of infected bugs, and enters the human body through the bite wound, or through the intact conjunctiva or other mucous membrane. Vector-borne transmission occurs only in the Americas, where an estimated 8 to 10 million people have Chagas disease. 5 Historically, transmission occurred largely in rural areas in Latin America, where houses built of mud brick are vulnerable to colonization by the triatomine vectors.4 In such areas, Chagas disease usually is acquired in childhood. In the last several decades, successful vector control programs have substantially decreased transmission rates in much of Latin America, and large-scale migration has brought infected individuals to cities both within and outside of Latin America. 4,6,7 Infected triatomine vectors and T. cruzi-infected domestic and wild animals are found across the southern half of the United States, and rare cases of autochthonous vector-borne transmission have been documented. 8-10 However, the risk of vector-borne infection within the United States appears to be very low, probably because of better housing conditions and less efficient vectors.11 T. cruzi also can be transmitted in blood; screening of blood donations for anti- T. cruzi antibodies was introduced in 2007 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a serological test for that purpose.12,13 Currently an estimated 90% of the U.S. blood supply is screened. For these reasons, the vast majority of the estimated 300,000 individuals in the United States with Chagas disease are thought to be immigrants who acquired the infection while living in endemic areas in Latin America. 14 In patients chronically infected with T. cruzi as a result of prior infection, profound immunosuppression (e.g., due to advanced HIV disease) may lead to reactivation disease characterized by parasitemia, associated with increased intracellular parasite replication and lack of immunological control of the infection. 15-17 Clinical Manifestations The acute phase of T. cruzi infection, which typically goes unrecognized, lasts up to 90 days and is characterized by circulating trypomastigotes detectable on microscopy of fresh blood or buffy coat smears.2,4 If the portal of infection was the conjunctiva, patients may develop the characteristic Roma\u00f1a's sign\u2014unilateral painless swelling of the upper and lower eyelids\u2014which usually lasts several weeks. The other symptoms of acute infection are usually limited to a non-specific febrile illness. In a small proportion of patients, however, acute, life-threatening myocarditis or meningoencephalitis may occur. 2,4 At the end of the acute phase, typically 60 to 90 days after infection, parasitemia falls below levels detectable by microscopy, and in the absence of effective etiologic treatment, T. cruzi infection passes into the chronic phase. 2,18 Most patients with chronic T. cruzi infection have no signs or symptoms, and are said to have the indeterminate form of the disease. Over the course of their lives, 20% to 30% of them will progress to clinically evident Chagas disease, most commonly cardiomyopathy. 2,18 The earliest manifestations are usually conduction system abnormalities, such as right bundle branch block, alone or in combination with frequent premature ventricular contractions, which may develop years to decades after infection. 4,19 Over time, the disease may progress to higher-grade heart block and complex ventricular arrhythmias. In patients with more advanced cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, ventricular aneurysm, and complete heart block are poor prognostic signs, associated with high rates of short-term mortality, including sudden death. 20 Chagas digestive disease is much less common than cardiomyopathy, and seen predominantly in infected patients Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV E-2in parts of Brazil and Bolivia.21 Dysphagia is the characteristic symptom of megaesophagus, and prolonged constipation is the most common complaint associated with megacolon. T. cruzi reactivation during the chronic phase of Chagas disease is characterized by a return to high levels of parasite replication and parasitemia, usually detectable by microscopy, and can occur in the settings of immunosuppressive therapy to prevent transplant rejection and cancer chemotherapy, as well as in HIV-infected patients. 16,22-26 Even in the absence of symptoms, patients with chronic Chagas disease who are HIV-co-infected have significantly higher levels of T. cruzi parasitemia than their immunocompetent counterparts.25 Most cases of clinically apparent reactivation occur in patients with CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts <200 cells/mm3, a history of prior opportunistic infections, or both.16 The clinical features of reactivated Chagas disease in patients with HIV infection differ from those observed in individuals who are immunosuppressed for other reasons. The most common manifestations consist of T. cruzi meningoencephalitis, with or without brain abscesses (chagomas). 15,16,27,28 The presentation may be confused with central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIDS patients with CNS symptoms or mass lesions on imaging. The second most frequently reported manifestation of reactivation in HIV-infected patients is acute myocarditis, sometimes superimposed on pre-existing chronic Chagas heart disease. 16,17 Patients may present with new arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, acute cardiac decompensation or rapid progression of existing chronic cardiomyopathy.16,29 Less frequent manifestations of reactivation include skin lesions, erythema nodosum, and parasitic invasion of the peritoneum, stomach or intestine. 16,29 Diagnosis Most patients infected with Chagas disease, including those in the United States, are in the chronic phase and typically unaware of their infection. Screening for infection in patients with the indeterminate or early clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease is important to identify those who might benefit from antiparasitic treatment and counseling regarding potential transmission of T. cruzi to others (e.g., blood donation, organ donation). This is particularly important for HIV-infected patients because of the risk of reactivation disease. Diagnosis of chronic infection relies on serological methods to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to T. cruzi, most commonly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). No available assay has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used alone; a single positive result does not constitute a confirmed diagnosis. Two serological tests based on different antigens (i.e., whole parasite lysate and recombinant antigens) and/or techniques (e.g., ELISA and IFA) are used in parallel to improve the accuracy. In some cases, the infection status remains difficult to resolve even after a third test, because there is no true gold standard assay for chronic T. cruzi infection. 30,31 Data suggest that the sensitivity of serological assays varies by geographical location, possibly because of T. cruzi strain differences and resulting antibody responses.32,33 Options for T. cruzi serological testing in the United States include diagnostic ELISA kits based on parasite lysate or recombinant antigens.30,34 In general, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not a useful diagnostic test for chronic T. cruzi infection. The sensitivity is highly variable and depends on patient characteristics as well as PCR primers and methods.35,36 In HIV-infected patients with epidemiologic risk for Chagas disease, co-infection with T. cruzi and reactivation disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CNS mass lesions, meningoencephalitis, arrhythmias or heart failure. 16,26,27 The imaging pattern of brain chagoma is similar to that of cerebral toxoplasmosis, although chagomas tend to be larger than Toxoplasma lesions.17,27,28 Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging show subcortical hypodense lesions that enhance with contrast or gadolinium. These lesions most often involve brain white matter. Histopathology shows inflammation and the presence of T. cruzi amastigotes in glial cells, and less often, in neurons. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows a mild pleocytosis (lymphocyte predominance), increased protein, and T. cruzi trypomastigotes. 16,17,27,28 In a case series that included 15 HIV and T. cruzi-co-infected patients with clinical meningoencephalitis, trypomastigotes were visualized in CSF in 85%.15,16,27,28 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV E-3A definitive diagnosis of re-activation is established by identification of the parasite or its products in tissue, such as on brain biopsy, in CSF or in blood.16 Circulating parasites are rarely detected microscopically in immunocompetent patients with chronic Chagas disease or in HIV-co-infected patients in the absence of reactivation. 25 If observed in an HIV-T. cruzi-co-infected patient, circulating parasites suggest reactivation and the need for treatment. Blood concentration techniques, such as capillary centrifugation, can improve sensitivity. 37 In centrifuged blood, T. cruzi trypomastigotes are found just above the buffy coat. Centrifugation and microscopic examination of CSF also can be employed for patients with suspected CNS Chagas disease. Parasites also may be observed in lymph nodes, bone marrow, skin lesions, or pericardial fluid. Hemoculture is somewhat more sensitive than direct methods, but takes 2 to 8 weeks to demonstrate parasites. Conventional PCR is not useful for diagnosing re-activation, because the method can yield a positive result in chronic T. cruzi infection in the absence of re-activation. 35,36 However, quantitative PCR assays (real-time PCR) performed on serial blood specimens that show rising parasite numbers over time provide the earliest and most sensitive indicator of reactivation. 38,39 Few published data exist on PCR of CSF, but it would be expected to have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of reactivation in the CNS.40 Preventing Exposure Travelers to endemic countries may be at risk for infection with T. cruzi if they visit rural areas and stay in rustic lodging. The triatomine vector typically infests cracks in walls and roofing of poor-quality buildings constructed of adobe brick, mud, or thatch. 41 Because the insects feed at night, individuals who live in or visit Chagas disease-endemic areas should avoid sleeping in such dwellings or outdoors. Control programs in endemic areas rely on spraying infested dwellings with residual-action insecticide. If sleeping outdoors or in suspect dwellings cannot be avoided, sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets provides significant protection. 42 Most blood products in the United States are screened routinely for T. cruzi but screening is not universal in the United States or in others areas, including parts of Latin America.43 Although transfusion-acquired cases have been uncommon in the United States, transfusion with infected blood products remains a risk for acquiring Chagas disease. No drugs or vaccines for preventing T. cruzi infection are available. Preventing Disease Clinical manifestations of Chagas disease in HIV-positive patients usually represent reactivation and not acute infection with T. cruzi. All HIV-infected patients with epidemiologic risk factors for Chagas disease should be tested for antibody to T. cruzi to detect latent infection. 18 A single course of treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can be considered for T. cruzi-infected individuals who have not been previously treated and who do not have advanced Chagas cardiomyopathy (CIII) . However, the efficacy of currently available drugs in the chronic phase is suboptimal, there is no useful test of cure, and treated individuals are still considered at risk for reactivation. 31,44 Although direct data are lacking, optimization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may help prevent Chagas reactivation in co-infected patients (BIII). Most symptomatic reactivation cases have occurred in patients who were not taking ART.16 Treating Disease Chemotherapy for Chagas disease with benznidazole or nifurtimox is effective in reducing parasitemia and preventing clinical manifestations or slowing progression in patients with acute, early-chronic, and re-activated disease. 44,45 These drugs have limited efficacy, however, in achieving parasitological cure. Consultation with a specialist should be sought. Benznidazole (5 to 8 mg/kg/day for 30 to 60 days) is the initial treatment most commonly recommended (BIII). Nifurtimox (8 to 10 mg/kg/day, administered for 90 to 120 days) is an alternative (CIII) . The duration of therapy with either of these agents has not been studied in patients co-infected with HIV . Mortality is high for symptomatic reactivated T. cruzi infection, Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV E-4even in patients who receive chemotherapy.16,27 Limited data suggest that early recognition and treatment of reactivation may improve prognosis.16 Benznidazole is approved by FDA for use in children 2-12 years of age and is commercially available at http://www.benznidazoletablets.com/en/ . Nifurtimox is not currently FDA approved and is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Drug Service for use under an investigational protocol. Consultations and nifurtimox requests should be addressed to Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria Public Inquiries line (404-718-4745); parasites@cdc.gov ), the CDC Drug Service (404-639-3670), and for emergencies after business hours, on weekends, and federal holidays through the CDC Emergency Operations Center (770-488-7100). Special Considerations with Regard to Starting Antiretroviral Therapy As with other parasite infections that localize in the CNS, the decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be carefully considered in HIV-infected patients with reactivated T. cruzi infection involving the brain. Only anecdotal information exists on the consequences of starting ART after a diagnosis of CNS Chagas disease, but there are no cases of Chagas-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) that have been well described. Therefore, there is no known contraindication to starting or optimizing ART in patients with CNS Chagas disease as soon as their CNS disease is clinically stable (AIII) . Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Patients undergoing treatment should be monitored closely because both benznidazole and nifurtimox are associated with significant toxicities. 46 Benznidazole causes peripheral neuropathy, rash, and granulocytopenia. Nifurtimox causes anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and weight loss, restlessness, tremors, and peripheral neuropathy. The adverse effects of both drugs wane when the drugs are discontinued. As stated above, no reports are available regarding T. cruzi infection and IRIS. Managing Treatment Failure Although no efficacy data are available, retreatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is recommended for HIV-infected patients with T. cruzi reactivation who fail to respond or who relapse after initial antitrypanosomal therapy (AIII) . A publication documents a single case of a T. cruzi-infected patient on immunosuppressive therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus who had a good response to posaconazole after failure of benznidazole treatment; failure of benznidazole and response to posaconazole were documented by real-time PCR assays in serial specimens. 47 However, the results of a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of low and high dose posaconazole to that of benznidazole demonstrated that posaconazole was not efficacious for treatment of chronic Chagas disease. 48 Preventing Recurrence Patients with HIV infection are at risk for recurrent or relapsing clinical manifestations because of intermittent reactivation of chronic infection. 16 The drugs are only partially effective in the chronic phase of T. cruzi infection and may be suppressive rather than curative.44 Because the drugs are toxic and experience with their use in HIV-infected patients is limited, expert advice should be sought.45 Whether secondary prophylaxis or chronic maintenance therapy should be used in HIV-infected patients with latent Chagas disease is unclear, particularly when potent ART is used. Special Considerations During Pregnancy As recommended for all individuals with epidemiological risk of Chagas disease, screening of pregnant women who have lived in endemic areas should be considered to identify maternal infection and possible risk of infection in their offspring. In pregnant women in areas where the disease is endemic in Latin America, the seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection can be as high as 30%. 14,49 In the United States, a 1999 study of 3,765 pregnant women in Houston, Texas, confirmed antibody to T. cruzi in 0.4% of Hispanic women and 0.1% of Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV E-5non-Hispanic women and a 2013 study of 4,000 predominantly Hispanic women in the same city found 0.25% with confirmed infection.50,51 From 1% to 10% of infants of T. cruzi-infected mothers are born with acute T. cruzi infection.14,49 Most congenital T. cruzi infections are asymptomatic or cause non-specific signs; laboratory screening is required for detection of these cases. Studies from the 1980s suggest that congenital transmission of T. cruzi may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and low birthweight. 52 In a small proportion of patients, congenital infection causes severe morbidity, including low birthweight, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, meningoencephalitis, and/or respiratory insufficiency, with high risk of mortality. 49 Limited data suggest that the rate of congenital transmission is higher for HIV-infected women than in immunocompetent mothers.16,53 Infants co-infected with HIV and T. cruzi also may be more likely to have symptoms, especially neurologic symptoms.54,55 Minimal data are available on potential reproductive toxicity of benznidazole and nifurtimox, although both drugs have been associated with increased detection of chromosomal aberrations in children being treated for Chagas disease. 56,57 Benznidazole crosses the placenta in rats and covalently binds to fetal proteins.58 Because of the toxicity and limited experience with use of these drugs in pregnancy, treatment of acute T. cruzi infection in pregnant women should only be undertaken in consultation with a specialist in this area, and treatment of chronic disease should be considered only after completion of the pregnancy. For HIV-infected pregnant women with symptomatic reactivation of T. cruzi infection, ART should be initiated (AIII) as initial treatment. Two cases of treatment of Chagas disease in pregnancy with benzdidazole have been reported. One report was of an acute infection with treatment continued for the first few weeks of an subsequently diagnosed pregnancy, with normal infant outcome, 59 and one was of treatment of an HIV-infected woman with severe immunosuppression with Chagasic encephalitis in the third trimester of pregnancy.60 The infant was small for gestational age but otherwise healthy and without evidence of T. cruzi infection. All infants born to T. cruzi- infected women should undergo appropriate testing for congenitally acquired T. cruzi infection and be treated promptly if infection is confirmed.14,61 Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis) Preventing Clinical Disease Indication Individuals with epidemic risk factors for Chagas disease and tested positive for antibody to T. cruzi, have not been previously treated, and do not have advanced Chagas cardiomyopathy. A single course of benznidazole or nifurtimox can be considered (doses and duration same as for treatment of disease) (CIII). However, the efficacy of this therapy is suboptimal, and treated patients are still at risk of reactivation. Initiation or optimization of ART may prevent reactivation of Chagas disease (BIII) Treating Chagas Disease Note: Treatment is effective in reducing parasitemia and preventing clinical manifestation or slowing progression in patients with acute, early-chronic, and re-activated disease. They have limited efficacy, however, in achieving parasitological cure. Preferred Therapy for Acute, Early Chronic, and Re-Activated Disease: Benznidazole 5-8 mg/kg/day PO in 2 divided 30-60 days (BIII) (commercially available at http://www. benznidazoletablets.com/en/). 8-10 mg/kg/day PO for 90-120 days (CIII) (not commercially available in the United States. Contact the CDC Drug Service at 404-639-3670 or drugservice@cdc.gov; for emergencies, call 770-488-7100) Note: Optimal duration of therapy has not been studied in HIV-infected patients. Initiation or optimization of ART in patients undergoing treatment for Chagas disease, once the patient is clinically stable (AIII) Even with treatment, mortality is high in patients with symptomatic reactivation.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV F-1Coccidioidomycosis (Last updated November 10, 2016; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Coccidioidomycosis is caused by a soil-dwelling fungus that consists of two species, Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii . Most cases of coccidioidomycosis in HIV-infected individuals have been reported in the areas in which the disease is highly endemic.1 In the United States, these areas include the lower San Joaquin Valley and other arid regions in southern California; much of Arizona; the southern regions of Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico; and western Texas.2 Recently, cases of coccidioidomycosis that appeared to be acquired in eastern Washington state have been reported.3 Whether this is anomalous or is a manifestation of an expanding area of endemicity is not clear at this time. In some instances, coccidioidomycosis has been diagnosed in patients with HIV infection well outside the known endemic regions. These have presumably been the result of reactivation of a previously acquired infection. The risk of developing symptomatic coccidioidomycosis after infection is increased in HIV-infected patients who have CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) counts <250 cells/mm 3 or who have been diagnosed with AIDS.4 The incidence and severity of HIV-associated coccidioidomycosis have declined since the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). 5,6 Clinical Manifestations Lack of suppression of HIV replication and lower CD4 cell counts are associated with the severity of the presentation of coccidioidomycosis. 6 Four common syndromes of coccidioidomycosis have been described in HIV-infected patients: focal pneumonia, diffuse pneumonia, extrathoracic involvement including meningitis, and positive coccidioidal serology tests without evidence of localized infection. 7 In addition, patients with HIV infection may develop dissemination to other extrathoracic sites, including the bones and joints. Focal pneumonia is most common in patients with CD4 counts 250 cells/mm3. This diagnosis can be difficult to distinguish from a bacterial community-acquired pneumonia; patients present with symptoms that include cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain.8,9 However, coccidioidomycosis may present lobe infiltrates, night sweats, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, all of which are uncommon in bacterial pneumonia. The syndromes other than focal pneumonia usually occur in more immunosuppressed patients. Diffuse pulmonary disease presents with fever and dyspnea and can be difficult to clinically distinguish from Pneumocystis pneumonia. 10 Hypoxemia may be severe and serological tests are frequently negative at the time of presentation. Routine bacterial cultures from pulmonary secretions frequently reveal Coccidioides after an incubation time of less than one week. Meningitis presents with a persistent headache and progressive lethargy. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile demonstrates low glucose levels with elevated protein and a lymphocytic pleocytosis. In addition, immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection may present with elevated coccidioidal serological titers without evidence of disease. A study in the era prior to potent ART described 13 patients, all with CD4 counts <350 cells/mm 3 and positive coccidioidal serologic tests. Five patients subsequently developed clinical illness at a median CD4 count of 10 cells/mm3.11 Diagnosis The diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is confirmed by culture of the organism from clinical specimens or by demonstration of spherules on histopathological examination of infected tissue. Blood cultures are positive in a minority of patients, usually those with diffuse pulmonary disease. Cultures of the CSF are positive in fewer than one-third of patients with coccidioidal meningitis. Unlike other endemic mycoses, Coccidioides grows relatively rapidly at 37\u00b0C on routine bacterial media, especially blood agar. Growth of a non-pigmented mould may be observed in as few as 3 days and can be confirmed as Coccidioides by gene probe. Coccidioides growing on an agar plate is a significant laboratory hazard because of the risk of inhalation of dislodged Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV F-2arthroconidia. Laboratory personnel should be alerted to the possibility of Coccidioides at the time the specimen is sent to the laboratory, and the plate lid securely taped.12 Identification of the fungus should be performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL 3) containment laboratory. Most commonly, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is based on a positive coccidioidal serological test associated with a compatable clinical syndrome. Patients with past coccidioidal infection without disease activity usually have negative serological tests. The nomenclature and variety of coccidioidal serological tests can be confusing. 13 The original assays examined two reactions. The first was the development of a precipitate in a tube when incubated with a heat-stable coccidioidal antigen preparation. This has been termed \"tube precipitin\" or TP response. It is due to an IgM antibody reaction, is not titratable, not useful in the diagnosis of meningitis, and is positive early in disease. If performed by immunodiffusion, it is termed IDTP. The second reaction originally detected the loss of serum complement activity in the presence of a heat-labile coccidioidal antigen preparation. This is called \"complement-fixing\" or CF, is due to an IgG response, is titratable, and its detection in the CSF is indicative of meningitis. CF antibody responses can also be measured by immunodiffusion (IDCF). In general, elevated CF titers suggest clinically active disease. Several companies offer enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). They appear to be similar to IDTP and IDCF with the following caveats. The IgM EIA has been associated with false positive results and the IgG EIA is not titratable. Both CF and EIA tests appear to be more sensitive than immunodiffusion assays. All coccidioidal serologic tests are positive less frequently in HIV infected patients with low CD4 cell counts than in those who are immunocompetent. 14 It is strongly recommended that clinical samples for serological testing be sent to laboratories with expertise in performing these assays. A coccidioidomycosis-specific antigen assay is commercially available. It has been shown to detect antigen in urine,15 serum16 and other body fluids in samples from individuals with active coccidioidomycosis. It is most useful in diagnosing extrathoracic disseminated coccidioidomycosis. A recent study suggests that detection of coccidioidal antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid has a very high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing coccidioidal meningitis. 17 Preventing Exposure HIV-infected individuals cannot completely avoid activities involving exposure to infection while living in or visiting areas where Coccidioides is endemic. They should, however, avoid extensive exposure to disturbed soil, such as at building excavation sites, and they should stay inside during dust storms (BIII). Preventing Disease Primary antifungal prophylaxis (i.e. prophylaxis for individuals with negative serologic tests for Coccidioides ) is of little benefit to patients with low CD4 cell counts who live in regions where Coccidioides is endemic 5 and it is not recommended (AIII). Yearly or twice-yearly serological testing for coccidioidomycosis is reasonable for serologically negative HIV-infected individuals who live in regions endemic for coccidioidomycosis. Testing is also advised for individuals who have traveled to or lived in endemic areas in the past. Both IgM and IgG antibody testing using either an EIA or immunodiffusion technique are recommended. A new positive test suggests possible active disease in patients with low CD4 cell counts 11 and further clinical evaluation should be undertaken. If no signs, symptoms or laboratory abnormalities compatible with active coccidioidomycosis are identified, antifungal therapy with fluconazole 400 mg daily is recommended for those with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm 3 (AIII) . This should be continued until the CD4 count is 250 cells/mm3 and ART has fully suppressed HIV replication (BIII). Outside endemic regions, routine testing does not appear to be useful and should not be performed (CIII) . Treating Disease Initial therapy with a triazole antifungal agent given orally is appropriate for patients who have clinically mild infection, such as focal pneumonia (AII). When prescribing triazoles, it should be noted that all of the triazole antifungals have the potential for complex, and possibly bidirectional, interactions with drugs Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV F-3that are principally based on CYP 3A4 enzyme for metabolism. Therapeutic drug monitoring and dosage adjustments, may be necessary. Clinicians should refer to Table 5 for dosage guidance when triazoles are used with other drugs for treatment of OI, and to the antiretroviral treatment guidelines for interaction recommendations with ARV , especially when used with ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimens. Without concomitant interacting drugs, fluconazole should be given as 400 mg daily (AII), while itraconazole should be given in divided doses of 200 mg two to three times daily (BII). 18,19 Itraconazole is preferred for those who have bone or joint disease (AI).20 Serum itraconazole levels should be measured after reaching steady state at 2 weeks to ensure adequate absorption. Data are limited for treatment with posaconazole21,22 and voriconazole, but these agents are useful for patients who fail to respond to fluconazole or itraconazole (BII). The dose of voriconazole is 200 mg twice daily after a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily for the first day (AIII) . Trough serum levels should be measured to ensure efficacy and avoid toxicity; a level of 1-5 mg/L is desired. Several dosage formulations of posaconazole have been studied for coccidioidomycosis. A dose of 400 mg twice daily of the older liquid formulation of posaconazole has been used (BII), 22 but the current extended-release tablet formulation is better tolerated by patients and provides more reliable absorption and serum levels. There is no established dosage with the tablet formulation for coccidioidomycosis but 300 mg daily is reasonable (BIII). There are no published data on the use of the newly approved triazole antifungal isavuconazole for coccidioidomycosis in patients with HIV infection. Among nine patients with pulmonary disease without HIV infection, initial therapy with isavuconazole resulted in complete or partial success in 5 (56%). 23 Patients with HIV infection and positive coccidioidal serologies but without clinical illness should be treated with antifungal therapy as previously described in the same manner as patients with focal pneumonia (AII). For patients with CD4 cell counts <250/mm 3 who are not receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, fluconazole 400 mg daily should be given and continued until the CD4 cell count is 250/mm3 and HIV RNA suppression has been achieved (AIII) . For those with CD4 cell counts already 250/mm3 and on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, close clinical follow-up is recommended (BIII). Amphotericin B is the preferred initial therapy for patients who have diffuse pulmonary involvement or are severely ill with extrathoracic disseminated disease (AII). 19 Most experience has been with the deoxycholate formulation, using an initial dose of 0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg intravenously (IV) daily. There are no reported studies that have used lipid formulations of amphotericin B for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis, but these are likely to be as effective as the deoxycholate formulation and should be considered as an equivalent initial therapy, particularly if there is underlying renal dysfunction (AIII). An initial daily dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg is appropriate. Therapy with amphotericin B should continue until clinical improvement is observed and then changed to an oral triazole antifungal (BIII). Some specialists recommend combining amphotericin B with a triazole antifungal (fluconazole or itraconazole) 400 mg daily at initiation of therapy, and then continuing the triazole once amphotericin B is stopped (CIII) . 19 Treatment of patients with coccidioidal meningitis requires consultation with a specialist (AIII) . Therapy should begin with a triazole antifungal. IV or oral fluconazole at a dose of 400 to 800 mg daily is preferred (AII), 24 but itraconazole also has been successfully used (BII).25 Therapy with posaconazole (CIII)22,26 or voriconazole (BIII)27-29 has been described in individual cases. Despite appropriate antifungal therapy, some patients may develop hydrocephalus and require CSF shunting. In some instances, triazole antifungals are ineffective and intrathecal amphotericin B is recommended (AIII) . If intrathecal therapy is required, it should be administered by someone very experienced in this technique. Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (including IRIS) Monitoring the CF antibody titer is useful in assessing response to therapy, and it should be measured every 12 weeks. A rise suggests recurrence or worsening of clinical disease and should prompt reassessment of management. As indicated previously, all of the triazole antifungals have the potential for complex, and possibly bidirectional, interactions with certain ARV agents and other anti-infective agents. Table 5 lists such Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV F-4interactions and recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring and dosage adjustments, where feasible. The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been infrequently reported in HIV-infected persons with concomitant coccidioidomycosis.30-32 Because of this, delaying initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy while treating coccidioidomycosis is not recommended (AIII) . Managing Treatment Failure Patients with severe coccidioidomycosis who fail treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole should have their treatment changed to IV amphotericin B, either deoxycholate or a lipid formulation (AIII) . For patients who are not severely ill, posaconazole (BII) and voriconazole (BIII) are appropriate alternatives. Drug interactions may limit the use of voriconazole in patients who are taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or ritonavir or cobicistat-boosted regimens (see Table 5 ). Posaconazole has fewer known drug interactions with ARV medications than does voriconazole. Therapy after Immune Reconstitution Patients with peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts 250/mm3 appear capable of maintaining their coccidioidal-specific cellular immune response.33 Moreover, a prospective study has demonstrated that the severity of coccidioidomycosis is less in those with lower HIV RNA and higher CD4 cell counts.6 Given these facts, in HIV-infected patients with undetectable HIV RNA on potent ARV therapy who have a CD4 250/mm 3, coccidioidomycosis should be managed no differently than it is in the general population (AII). For patients who meet the above criteria with focal pulmonary disease, treatment with triazole antifungal should continue for a minimum of 6 months (AII). For patients with diffuse pulmonary disease and those with extrathoracic dissemination, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 12 months and usually much longer. Discontinuation of therapy should be based on clinical and immunological response in consultation with an expert. For patients with detectable HIV viremia or CD4 <250/mm 3, antifungal therapy at full dose should continue (BIII). Prevention of Relapse Relapse occurs in 25% to 33% of HIV-uninfected patients who have diffuse pulmonary disease or nonmeningeal disseminated coccidioidomycosis 34,35 and may occur in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts 250 cells/mm3 on potent ART36. Continued monitoring during coccidiomycosis therapy and after such therapy has been discontinued with clinical follow-up, serial chest radiographs and coccidioidal serology every 3 to 6 months should be performed. Because relapses have been reported in 80% of patients with meningitis in whom triazoles have been discontinued, 37 therapy for coccidioidal meningitis should be continued for life (AII). Special Considerations During Pregnancy Women are generally at less risk than men for severe coccidioidomycosis and disease does not appear to worsen in women with prior coccidioidomycosis during pregnancy. However, coccidioidomycosis is likely to be severe and disseminated if infection is acquired during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. 38 Congenital malformations similar to those observed in animals, including craniofacial and limb abnormalities, have been reported in infants born to mothers who received fluconazole through or beyond the first trimester of pregnancy. 39 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort or case-control studies reporting fetal outcomes after exposure to any dose of fluconazole used in the first trimester of pregnancy found an increased risk of heart defects 40 but did not find an increase in the rate of overall malformations or in craniofacial defects. One registry-based cohort study (included in the systematic review)41 and a more recent large population-based case-control study42 specifically noted an increase in conotruncal heart defects. The latter study also suggested an increase in cleft lip with cleft palate. In addition in a nation-wide cohort study from Denmark oral fluconazole in pregnancy was associated with an increase risk of spontaneous abortion compared to unexposed women or those with topical azole exposure Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV F-5only.42 Most of the studies regarding effects of fluconazole in pregnancy have involved low doses and short term exposure. Based on the reported birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration has changed the pregnancy category from C to D for fluconazole for any use other than a single, 150 mg dose to treat vaginal candidiasis (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm266030.htm). Although there are case reports of birth defects in infants exposed to itraconazole, prospective cohort studies of over 300 women with first trimester exposure did not show an increased risk of malformation. 43,44 However, in general, all azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy (BIII). One problematic area is coccidioidal meningitis, in which the only alternative treatment to triazole antifungals is IV or intrathecal amphotericin B. For such situations, the decision regarding choice of treatment should be based on considerations of benefit versus potential risk and made in consultation with the mother, the infectious diseases consultant, and the obstetrician. 45 V oriconazole and posaconazole are teratogenic and embryotoxic in animal studies; for voriconazole, these occurred at doses lower than recommended for humans. There are no adequately controlled studies in humans. These drugs should be avoided in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester (AIII). Intravenous amphotericin B, formulated with deoxycholate or as a lipid preparation, is the preferred treatment for non-meningeal coccidioidomycosis during the first trimester of pregnancy (AIII) . Extensive clinical use of amphotericin B has not been associated with teratogenicity. At delivery, infants born to women treated with amphotericin B should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. Recommendations for Treating Coccidiodomycosis (page 1 of 2) Treating Mild Infections (Such As Focal Pneumonia or asymptomatic patients with positive serology and CD4 count <250 cells/mm3) Preferred Therapy: Fluconazole 400 mg PO once daily (BII)*, or Itraconazole 200 mg PO twice daily (BII)* Alternative Therapy (For Patients Who Failed To Respond To Fluconazole Or Itraconazole): Voriconazole 200 mg PO twice daily after a loading dose of 400 mg twice on first day (BIII)*; or Posaconazole (delayed release tablet) 300 mg PO daily after a loading dose of 300 mg twice daily for one day , then 300 mg once daily* (BIII)* or Posaconazole (oral suspension) 400 mg PO twice daily (BII)* Treating Bone or Joint Infections Preferred Therapy: Itraconazole 200 mg PO twice daily (AI)* Alternative Therapy: Fluconazole 400 mg PO once daily (BI)* Treating Severe, Non-Meningeal Infection (Diffuse Pulmonary or Severely Ill Patients with Extrathoracic Disseminated Disease)\u2014Acute Phase Preferred Therapy: Lipid formulation amphotericin Amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7-1.0 mg/kg IV daily (AII) Use until clinical improvement, then switch to triazole (BIII) Alternative Therapy: Some specialists add a triazole (either fluconazole 400 mg daily or itraconazole 200 mg twice daily , with itraconazole preferred for bone or joint disease) to amphotericin B therapy and continue the triazole once amphotericin B is stopped (BIII) Treatment For Meningeal Infections (Consultation With A Specialist Is Advised) Preferred Therapy: Fluconazole 400-800 mg PO daily (AII); IV if patient unable to take orally.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-1Community-Acquired Pneumonia (Last updated October 10, 2019; last reviewed October 10, 2019) Epidemiology Bacterial respiratory diseases, including sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis, and pneumonia, are among the most common infectious complications in patients with HIV , occurring with increased frequency at all CD4 T lymphocyte cell (CD4) counts. 1 This chapter will focus on the diagnosis, prevention, and management of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients with HIV . In general, although data are limited, hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia do not differ in terms of microbiology, clinical course, treatment, or prevention in persons with HIV as compared to persons without HIV with similar HIV-unrelated comorbidities. Therefore, they will not be addressed in these guidelines. Bacterial pneumonia is a common cause of HIV-associated morbidity. Recurrent pneumonia, considered two or more episodes within a 1-year period, is an AIDS-defining condition. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV has decreased progressively with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). 2-7 In one study, the incidence of bacterial pneumonia declined from 22.7 episodes per 100 person-years before the introduction of ART to 9.1 episodes per 100 person-years by 1997 after ART was introduced. Since then, the incidence of bacterial pneumonia among people with HIV in developed countries has continued to drop. In the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study, the incidence rate of serious bacterial infections overall was 0.87 per 100 person-years, and approximately 40% of these infections were due to bacterial pneumonia. 4 Recurrent bacterial pneumonia as an AIDS-defining illness is also less frequently encountered in individuals on ART; however, its exact incidence is hard to evaluate because surveillance data for it are not collected systematically as for other opportunistic infections. 8 Despite ART, bacterial pneumonia remains more common in individuals with HIV than in those who do not have HIV . 9-11 Bacterial pneumonia may be the first manifestation of underlying HIV infection and can occur at any stage of HIV disease and at any CD4 count. Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV results from multiple risk factors, particularly immune defects. A CD4 count decrease, especially when below 100 cells/mm 3 continues to be a major risk factor for pneumonia due to routine bacterial pathogens. Other immune defects include quantitative and qualitative B-cell abnormalities that result in impaired pathogen-specific antibody production, abnormalities in neutrophil function or numbers, and abnormalities in alveolar macrophage function. 12,13 Lack of ART or intermittent use of ART increases the risk for pneumonia, likely due to uncontrolled HIV viremia.14 Additional risk factors that contribute to the continued risk for bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV include tobacco, alcohol, and/or injection drug use; and chronic viral hepatitis. 3,10,15,16 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, renal insufficiency, and congestive heart failure are emerging as risk factors for pneumonia, particularly in the population of older adults with HIV . 17 Risk for CAP can also increase with obesity,4 an emerging health problem in people living with HIV . Microbiology In individuals with HIV , Streptococcus pneumoniae ( S. pneumoniae) and Haemophilus species are the most frequently identified causes of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, the same as in individuals without HIV . 18-24 Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae are among the most common etiologies of pneumonia in association with influenza infection.25,26 Atypical such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila species have been reported as infrequent causes of CAP in individuals with HIV .21,27 However, when more extensive testing such as serology to detect IgM antibodies and/or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of respiratory secretions was performed, additional infections due to Mycoplasma and Chlamydia were detected. 28 Respiratory viruses are also a Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-2common cause of CAP. Although virally-induced CAP is less studied in individuals with HIV , data from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of the epidemiology of CAP in adult patients in five hospitals in Nashville and Chicago showed that respiratory viruses were detected in nearly a quarter of the adults with CAP (23% had one or more respiratory viruses and 3% had both respiratory viruses and bacteria). 29 The frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and S. aureus as community-acquired pathogens is higher in individuals with HIV than in those without HIV based on studies in the early combination ART era. 22,30 Many of these patients often had poorly controlled HIV or the presence of other concomitant risk factors that contributed to the risk for P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. Patients with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count 50 cells/mm3) or underlying neutropenia, as well as pre-existing lung disease such as bronchiectasis or severe COPD have an increased risk of infection with P. aeruginosa. Other risk factors for infection include the use of corticosteroids, severe malnutrition, hospitalization within the past 90 days, residence in a health care facility or nursing home, and chronic hemodialysis. 31 S. aureus should be considered in patients with recent viral infection (particularly influenza), a history of injection drug use, or severe, bilateral, necrotizing pneumonia. Risk factors for S. aureus pneumonia in patients with HIV include receipt of antibiotics prior to hospital admission, comorbid illnesses, and recent health care contact. 32 Community outbreaks of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection have also been seen among men who have sex with men.33 Studies of patients without HIV have identified hemodialysis, known prior colonization or infection with MRSA, as well as recurrent skin infections to be risk factors for MRSA pneumonia. 31 Notably, nasal carriage and colonization of skin sites with MRSA is more common in individuals with HIV than in those without HIV , and is more likely in patients recently incarcerated and/or hospitalized. 34,35 Clinical Manifestations The clinical and radiographic presentation of bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV , particularly in those with higher CD4 count and HIV viral suppression, is similar to that in individuals without HIV . 36 Patients with pneumonia caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus species characteristically have acute onset (3-5 days) of symptoms, including fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea. 37 The presence of fever, tachycardia, and/or hypotension can be indicators of sepsis. Tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/ or pleural effusion on lung examination. In contrast, lung examination often is normal in those with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In patients with bacterial pneumonia, the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated. The elevation may be relative to baseline WBC count in those with advanced HIV . Neutrophilia or a left shift in WBC differential may be present. Individuals with bacterial pneumonia characteristically exhibit unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation on chest radiograph. The frequency of these typical radiographic findings, however, may depend on the underlying bacterial pathogen. Those with pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be a feature more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. In individuals with HIV the incidence of bacteremia accompanying pneumonia is greater than in individuals without HIV , especially when infection is due to S. pneumoniae. 38 In data from CDC, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, inclusive of bacteremia, was significantly higher in individuals with HIV; rates were 173 cases per 100,000 in those with HIV infection, compared to 3.8 per 100,000 in younger adults aged 18-34 years and 36.4 per 100,000 among those aged 65 years in the general population. 39 Similarly, in a study from Kenya, the rate of pneumococcal bacteremia was significantly higher in individuals with HIV infection (rate ratio of HIV-positive versus HIV-negative adults, 19.7, 95% CI, 12.4-31.1). 40 With Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-3the introduction of ART and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for both the general pediatric population and individuals living with HIV , this disparity in incidence rates of bacteremia between people with and without HIV has narrowed but has not been eliminated. 41-45 Risk factors associated with bacteremia include lack of ART, low CD4 count (particularly <100 cells/mm3), as well as alcohol abuse, current smoking, and comorbidities, particularly liver disease.42 Disease severity and arterial oxygenation should be assessed in all patients with pneumonia. Noninvasive measurement of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is an appropriate screening test. Arterial blood gas analysis is indicated for patients with evidence of hypoxemia suggested by noninvasive assessment and for patients who have tachypnea and/or respiratory distress. The use of severity scoring systems for pneumonia and their application to patients with HIV are discussed in the Treating Disease section. Although some studies suggest that bacterial pneumonia is associated with increased mortality in individuals with HIV , 22,46,47 others do not.36,48-50 Independent predictors of increased mortality in a prospective, multicenter study of individuals with HIV with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were CD4 count <100 cells/mm 3, radiographic progression of disease, and of that study, multilobar infiltrates, cavitary infiltrates, and pleural on baseline imaging were all independent predictors of radiographic progression of disease. However, in patients on ART with controlled HIV viremia, and high CD4 counts (>350 cells/mm 3), the clinical courses and outcomes of pneumonia appear to be similar to those in patients without HIV .36 As in patients without HIV , pneumonia may have an impact on longer term outcomes of patients with HIV . This includes greater long-term mortality, as hospitalization for pneumonia has been associated with increased mortality up to one year later. 52 Pneumonia has also been associated with impaired lung function and risk of subsequent lung cancer in individuals with HIV .53-55 Diagnosis General Approach Patients with clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of CAP should have posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs; evidence of pneumonia can also be found on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, but routine use of chest CT scan for this purpose is not recommended. Lung ultrasound can also be used to aid in the diagnosis pneumonia. If previous radiographs are available, they should be reviewed to assess for new findings. The clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia requires a demonstrable infiltrate by chest radiograph or other imaging technique in conjunction with compatible clinical symptoms and signs. The differential diagnosis of pneumonia in individuals with HIV is broad and a confirmed microbiologic diagnosis should be pursued. Microbial identification can allow clinicians to target the specific pathogen(s) and discontinue broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and/or empiric therapy that targets non-bacterial pathogens. Given the increased incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in individuals with HIV , a tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis should always be considered in patients with HIV who have pneumonia. Those with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of TB should be managed as potentially having TB (i.e., respiratory isolation for hospitalized patients), and two to three sputum specimens should be obtained for acid fast bacilli evaluation (including TB PCR; see Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection and Disease). Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage should be considered, especially if the differential diagnosis includes opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii . Procalcitonin (PCT) testing has been proposed as a tool to distinguish between bacterial and viral respiratory infections. One study from Africa specifically evaluated the usefulness of PCT testing to distinguish CAP due to bacteria (non-TB), M. tuberculosis, and PCP in persons with HIV . In general, PCT levels associated with bacterial pneumonia are higher than those associated with viral or fungal pneumonias, but levels can also be elevated in non-bacterial pulmonary infections. 56 Specific PCT thresholds have not been established or validated in HIV-associated bacterial pneumonia. Thus, given the lack of data, the use of PCT to guide Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-4decisions regarding etiology of pneumonia, initiation of anti-bacterial treatment, or duration of treatment in patients with HIV is not recommended. Recommended Diagnostic Evaluation in Community-Acquired Pneumonia Guidelines for microbiologic testing for diagnosis of CAP in individuals without HIV generally also apply to persons with HIV . 57 In patients with HIV with CAP who are well enough to be treated as outpatients, routine diagnostic tests to identify a bacterial etiologic diagnosis are optional, especially if the microbiologic studies cannot be performed promptly. In patients with HIV hospitalized for CAP, a Gram stain of expectorated sputum and two blood cultures are recommended, particularly in those with severe pneumonia, in those who are not on ART; or in those who are known to have a CD4 count <350 cells/mm 3 (and especially if <100 cells/mm3) prior to hospitalization. Specimens should ideally be obtained before initiation of antibiotics, or within 12 hours to 18 hours of such initiation. Urinary antigen tests for L. pneumophila and S. pneumoniae are recommended in hospitalized patients, particularly those with severe CAP. In addition, lower respiratory tract secretions should be cultured for Legionella on selective media or undergo Legionella nucleic acid amplification testing in adults with severe CAP. Legionella testing should also be done in patients with HIV with non-severe CAP when indicated by epidemiological factors, such as association with a Legionella outbreak or recent travel. Microbiologic diagnostic testing is indicated whenever epidemiologic, clinical, or radiologic clues prompt suspicion of specific pathogens that could alter standard empirical management decisions. If available, rapid MRSA nasal testing should be performed, particularly in patients with risk factors for MRSA or in a high prevalence setting, as results can direct empiric antibiotic therapy.58 Gram stain and culture of sputum is recommended in all hospitalized patients meeting the criteria stated above and is optional in individuals with HIV and CAP not meeting these criteria. In general, Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum should be performed only if a good-quality specimen can be obtained prior to (or not more than 12-18 hours after) initiation of antibiotics, and quality performance measures for collection, transport, and processing of samples can be met. Sputum cultures in patients with HIV have been shown to identify a bacterial etiology in up to 30% to 40% of good quality specimens 47,59 although yield is less in other studies.14,28 Correlation of sputum culture with Gram stain can help in interpretation of sputum culture data. For intubated patients, an endotracheal aspirate sample should be obtained promptly after intubation, or bronchoscopy may be indicated. Blood cultures are more likely to be positive in individuals with HIV than in those without HIV . Patients with HIV , particularly those with lower CD4 counts, are at increased risk of invasive infection with S. pneumoniae. Given concerns for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, 60,61 as well as S. aureus and/or other drug- resistant pathogens, blood cultures are recommended for patients with HIV who meet the criteria as noted above, and are optional for those who do not meet the criteria listed. Diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed in all patients with pleural effusion if concern exists for accompanying empyema, and pleural fluid should be sent for microbiologic studies. Therapeutic thoracentesis should be performed to relieve respiratory distress secondary to a moderate-to-large-sized pleural effusion. Given the increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in patients with HIV , clinicians should be vigilant for evidence of extra-pulmonary complications of infection. Preventing Exposure No effective means exist to reduce exposure to S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae , which are common in the community. General precautions to maintain health, such as adhering to hand hygiene and Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-5cough etiquette and refraining from close contact with individuals who have respiratory infections, should be emphasized for patients with HIV as for other patient populations. Preventing Disease Vaccination against S. pneumoniae and influenza, use of ART, and lifestyle modifications are all important measures in preventing bacterial pneumonia. Multiple observational studies have reported benefits of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in persons with HIV . 16,62-68 Several studies also have documented an association between vaccination and a reduced risk of pneumococcal bacteremia.42,67 One randomized placebo-controlled trial of PPV in Africa paradoxically found that vaccination was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. 69 Follow-up of this cohort confirmed the increase in pneumonia in vaccinated participants, but notably also showed a decrease in all-cause mortality.70 However, subsequent observational studies have demonstrated that PPV vaccination provides people with HIV moderate protection against pneumococcal disease. 71 The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use in adults with immunocompromising conditions, including HIV infection. 39 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 7-valent PCV among adults with in Malawi demonstrated 74% efficacy against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease, with clear evidence of efficacy in those with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3.72 Adults and adolescents with HIV who have never received any pneumococcal vaccine should receive a single dose of PCV13 regardless of CD4 count (AI). 39 Patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3 should receive a dose of 23-valent PPV (PPV23) at least 8 weeks later (AI).62-68,73,74 While individuals with HIV with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 can also be offered PPV23 at least 8 weeks after receiving PCV13 (CIII) (e.g., when there are concerns with retention in care), PPV23 should preferably be deferred until after an individual's CD4 count increases to >200 cells/mm 3 while on ART (BIII). Clinical evidence supporting use of PPV23 in persons with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 appears strongest in patients who also have HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL;73,74 evidence also suggests benefit for those who start ART before receiving PPV vaccination.67,75 The duration of the protective effect of PPV23 is unknown; a single revaccination with PPV is recommended if 5 years have elapsed since the first dose of PPV23 was given (BII). 66 A final dose of PPV23 is recommended after age 65 years, and should be given 5 years after any doses that were given before age 65 years (BII). Typically, no more than three doses of PPV23 are given in a lifetime. PCV13 should also be given to patients with HIV who have already received PPV23 (AII). 76 However, in such cases, adult patients should wait 1 year after their most recent dose of PPV23 before receiving a single dose of PCV13 (BIII);39 adolescents aged <19 years should wait 8 weeks (BIII). Subsequent doses of PPV23 should be given according to the schedule outlined above (i.e., 5 years between doses of PPV23 with no more than 3 lifetime doses). Inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine should be administered annually during influenza season to all individuals with HIV (AII). 77 This recommendation is pertinent to prevention of bacterial pneumonia, which can occur as a complication of influenza. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines can be administered during the same visit. Use of live attenuated influenza vaccine is contraindicated and is not recommended in individuals with HIV (AIII) . Use of high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine is associated with decreased incidence of influenza and greater antibody response in adults without HIV aged 65 years. 78 One study found greater immunogenicity in individuals with HIV aged 18 years who were given high-dose influenza vaccine compared with standard-dose inactivated vaccine. 79 While providers can also give the high-dose influenza vaccine to their patients with HIV aged 65 years (CIII) , there are no data on the efficacy of high-dose influenza vaccine in individuals with HIV . Currently, the high-dose vaccine is trivalent rather than quadrivalent, offering Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-6protection against one rather than two Influenza B viruses and two Influenza A viruses. The incidence of H. influenzae type b infection in adults with HIV is low. Therefore, H. influenzae type vaccine is not usually recommended for adult use (BIII)75 unless a patient also has anatomic or functional asplenia.Several factors are associated with a decreased risk of bacterial pneumonia in HIV , including use of ART and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for PCP prophylaxis. 47 In many studies, daily administration of TMP-SMX for PCP prophylaxis reduced the frequency of bacterial respiratory infections.9,80,81 This point should be considered when selecting an agent for PCP prophylaxis; however, indiscriminate use of TMP-SMX (when not indicated for PCP prophylaxis or other specific reasons) may promote development of TMP-SMX-resistant organisms. Thus, in the United States, TMP-SMX should not be prescribed solely to prevent bacterial respiratory infection (AIII) . Similarly, clarithromycin or azithromycin should not be prescribed solely for preventing bacterial respiratory infection (AIII) . A decreased absolute neutrophil count (e.g., <500 cells/mm 3) is associated with an increased risk of bacterial infections, including pneumonia, although this risk has been demonstrated primarily in persons with malignant neoplasms. To reduce the risk of such bacterial infections, clinicians should take steps to reverse neutropenia, such as by stopping myelosuppressive drugs (CIII) . Studies of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in persons with HIV have failed to document benefit. 82,83 Modifiable factors associated with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia include smoking cigarettes, using injection drugs, and consuming alcohol. 9,68,84-86 Clinicians should encourage cessation of these behaviors, refer patients to appropriate services, and/or prescribe medications to support quitting. Data demonstrate that smoking cessation can decrease the risk of bacterial pneumonia. 15 Treating Disease General Approach to Treatment The basic principles of antibiotic treatment of CAP are the same for patients with HIV as for those who do not have HIV .57 As discussed in the Diagnosis section, if specimens are to be collected for diagnosis, they should preferably be collected before antibiotic therapy is initiated or within 12 hours to 18 hours of antibiotic initiation. However, antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly, without waiting for the results of diagnostic testing. Empiric therapy varies based on geographic region and common pathogens in these regions, and should take into account local resistance patterns, results of MRSA rapid swab testing if done, and individual patient risk factors, including severity of immunocompromise (recent CD4 cell count, HIV viral load) and use of ART. In patients with HIV , providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections, such as PCP, that would alter empiric treatment. In settings where the prevalence of TB is high, initiation of empiric therapy for both bacterial pneumonia and TB may be appropriate for patients in whom both diagnoses are strong considerations and after diagnostic studies are undertaken. Because respiratory fluoroquinolones are also active against M. tuberculosis, they should be used with caution in patients with suspected TB who are not being treated with concurrent standard four-drug TB therapy. Thus, patients with TB who are treated with fluoroquinolones in the absence of standard four-drug TB therapy may have an initial, but misleading response, that could delay diagnosis of TB and initiation of appropriate multidrug TB therapy, increasing the risk of drug-resistant TB and TB transmission. Assessing Severity of Disease and Treatment Location Whether patients should be treated on an outpatient basis or admitted to the hospital depends on several factors. In addition to considerations regarding ability to take oral medications, adherence, and other confounding factors (e.g., housing, comorbid diseases), severity of illness is a key factor that helps to guide decisions regarding treatment location for CAP\u2014outpatient versus inpatient, including intensive care unit Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-7(ICU). Notably, no prospective randomized clinical trials have assessed the performance of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) for CAP or other severity scores (e.g., the Infectious Diseases Society of America [IDSA]/American Thoracic Society [ATS] [ATS/IDSA] severity criteria57 or CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity) to guide decisions regarding inpatient or outpatient treatment location for persons with HIV . However, the PSI, CURB-65, the ATS/IDSA severity criteria, and other scoring systems appear to be valid for predicting mortality in patients with HIV with CAP, especially when used in combination with CD4 count. 51,87,88 One study suggested that the site of care decision be dictated by considering the PSI score and CD4 count together.87 Mortality was increased in patients with higher PSI risk class; however, even in those without an increased mortality risk by PSI, a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 was associated with an increased risk of death.87 This led to the suggestion to hospitalize CAP patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 and to use the PSI to help guide decision-making in those with higher CD4 counts.89 However, other studies have found the PSI was predictive of outcomes independent of CD4 count.90 Furthermore, CD4 count or HIV RNA level are not clearly associated with short-term outcomes of CAP.91 Other HIV-specific scoring systems such as the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index, although originally designed to predict overall mortality, may also be useful in predicting ICU admission and mortality. In a study of older patients with and without HIV with CAP, a higher V ACS Index was associated with greater 30-day mortality, readmission, and length of stay. 92 Therefore, in general, validated clinical prediction scores for prognosis can be used in patients with HIV in conjunction with clinical judgement to guide treatment location for CAP. Low risk patients for whom there are no other concerns regarding adherence or complicating factors can be treated as outpatients. Patients with severe CAP, including those presenting with shock or respiratory failure, usually require a higher level of care, typically ICU admission. Additionally, severe CAP criteria can include PSI risk class of III or IV or CURB-65 scores 3. Patients with 3 of the ATS/IDSA minor severity criteria for CAP 57 often require ICU or higher level of care as well. Empiric Antibiotic Therapy by Treatment Setting and Severity of Diseases There is a general paucity of clinical trials evaluating different antibiotic regimens for treating CAP in populations with HIV and a lack of evidence that treatment response to antibiotics is different in individuals with HIV than in those without HIV . Therefore, treatment recommendations for CAP in individuals with HIV are generally consistent with those for persons without HIV . Outpatient Community-Acquired Pneumonia Treatment Individuals with HIV who are being treated as outpatients should receive an oral beta-lactam plus an oral macrolide (AI), or an oral respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are high-dose amoxicillin or azithromycin clarithromycin. Preferred oral respiratory are or levofloxacin. An oral respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) should be used as an alternative to a beta lactam in patients who are allergic to penicillin. If a patient has contraindications to a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone, then doxycycline should be given as an alternative (BIII) in addition to a beta-lactam. Empirical monotherapy with a macrolide for outpatient CAP is not routinely recommended in patients with HIV for two reasons (BIII). First, increasing rates of pneumococcal resistance have been reported with macrolide-resistant rates up to 30%, 93 prompting concerns for possible treatment failure. In this regard, local drug resistance patterns, if available, can help inform treatment decisions. Second, patients who are already receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have resistance due to chronic exposure and should also not receive macrolide monotherapy for empiric treatment of bacterial pneumonia. However, macrolides can be used as part of a combination CAP regimen. Non-Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia Inpatient Treatment Individuals with HIV who are being treated as inpatients should receive an intravenous (IV) beta-lactam Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-8plus a macrolide (AI) or an IV respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Monotherapy with a macrolide is not recommended in the inpatient setting. The role for dual therapy with a macrolide is somewhat controversial based on prior observational studies and two prospective clinical trials in patients without HIV with CAP that evaluated outcomes in those treated with beta-lactam monotherapy and those treated with dual-therapy including a macrolide. 94,95 In one study, beta-lactam monotherapy was not found to be non-inferior to beta- lactam/macrolide combination therapy. Notably, in the monotherapy arm, patients who had more severe CAP, as indicated by a PSI IV , or who had atypical pathogens were less likely to reach clinical stability. There were also more 30-day readmissions among the patients on monotherapy. 94 While there was a trend towards improved outcomes in those on dual therapy, the difference between arms was not statistically significant. In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, cross-over trial of non-ICU hospitalized patients with CAP, beta-lactam monotherapy was found to be non-inferior to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy. 95 However in this study, the diagnosis of CAP did not require radiographic confirmation, illness was mild, and there were cross-overs between groups. Only one study thus far has compared a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) to dual therapy with a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) plus macrolide in 225 persons with HIV with CAP, finding no difference between in-hospital or 14-day mortality between the groups; most patients had lower severity of disease, with only 7% of the cohort having a CURB-65 score >2 and 17% with a PSI risk class >III. 96 Given the heterogeneity and limitations of recent studies and scarce data in patients with HIV , the recommendation for patients with HIV who are hospitalized with non-severe CAP remains to administer either beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, or a single drug regimen of a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or respiratory fluoroquinolones are moxifloxacin or levofloxacin. If a patient has contraindications to a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone, then doxycycline should be given as an alternative (BIII) in addition to a beta-lactam. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changes in the penicillin breakpoints for treatment of non-meningitis pneumococcal disease imply IV penicillin is an acceptable option for treatment of pneumococcal disease in patients with HIV (BIII). 97 In patients who are allergic to penicillin, an IV respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) alone should be used (AI). As noted, fluoroquinolone monotherapy should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but who are not being treated with concurrent standard four-drug TB therapy. Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia Treatment Patients with severe CAP should not receive empiric monotherapy, even with a fluoroquinolone, because of the range of potential pathogens and the desirability of prompt and microbiologically active therapy (AI). In one study, the use of dual therapy (usually with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide) was associated with reduced mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, including those admitted to the ICU. 98 Patients with severe pneumonia should be treated with an IV beta-lactam plus either IV azithromycin (AI) or an IV respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam. In patients who are allergic to penicillin, aztreonam plus an IV respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) should be used (BIII). Most CAP pathogens can be treated adequately with recommended empiric regimens. The increased incidence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (including community-acquired MRSA) as causes of CAP are exceptions. Both pathogens occur in specific epidemiologic patterns with distinct clinical presentations for which empiric antibiotic coverage may be warranted. Diagnostic tests (sputum Gram stain and culture) are likely to be of high yield for these pathogens, allowing early discontinuation of empiric treatment if results are negative. The addition of corticosteroids for treating CAP has not been studied in individuals with HIV . Data from studies in persons without HIV with CAP suggest that corticosteroids may decrease a composite outcome of mortality, time to clinical stability, and length of hospital stay, 99 except in influenza pneumonia, where corticosteroids increase mortality.100 The optimal regimen including dose, duration, and formulation of Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-9corticosteroid, and the patient population with bacterial non-influenza related CAP most likely to benefit from the additional use of corticosteroids remain uncertain. Selecting patients without HIV with severe CAP and increased inflammation as defined by C-reactive protein levels >150 mg/mL is one strategy for treatment of CAP that has been shown to be beneficial. 101 Overall, the use of corticosteroids in patients with HIV with severe CAP is not routinely recommended (CIII) given the lack of data specifically in populations with HIV . If providers administer corticosteroids to patients with HIV with severe CAP, they must ensure that no other contraindications to steroids exist; in patients who have no contraindications and have persistent shock despite fluid resuscitation, following Surviving Sepsis Guidelines 102 and administering hydrocortisone 200 mg IV daily for 3 to 7 days (or tapering once vasopressors are no longer needed) is reasonable (CIII) . Empiric Pseudomonas aeruginosa Treatment If risk are present, an antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (750-mg (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, or meropenem. Alternative therapeutic agents that are recommended are an antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (BII). In patients who are allergic to penicillin, aztreonam is recommended to be used in place of the beta-lactam (BII). Empiric Staphylococcus aureus Treatment A nasal swab for MRSA can help inform decision-making whether initial empiric coverage should include MRSA. In studies of patients without HIV , negative test results have a high negative predictive value for pneumonia due to MRSA. If the nasal swab is negative for MRSA and the pneumonia is not severe and no other risk factors or features suggestive of MRSA pneumonia are present, empiric coverage for MRSA may be withheld (BII). 58 However, in patients who have risk factors for S. aureus infection, vancomycin or linezolid should be added to the antibiotic regimen (AII). Empiric coverage for MRSA should also be added if a rapid nasal swab is positive for MRSA, although the positive predictive value for pneumonia is only moderate, and therapy should be de-escalated if cultures are negative (BIII). Although not routinely recommended, the addition of clindamycin to vancomycin (but not to linezolid) or the use of linezolid alone, is recommended by many experts if severe necrotizing pneumonia is present to minimize bacterial toxin production (CII). Telavancin is an alternative agent that can be used for S. aureus pneumonia (BIII); it is currently FDA- approved for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated (rather than community-acquired) pneumonia based on studies in persons without HIV infection. 103 While ceftaroline has activity against MRSA, and data suggest it can be effective for MRSA pneumonia, it has been FDA approved for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia based on two studies that did not include any MRSA isolates. 104 Neither telavancin or ceftaroline have been specifically studied in patients with HIV with bacterial pneumonia. Daptomycin should not be used to treat pneumonia as it is not active in the lung (AI). Pathogen-Directed Therapy When the etiology of the pneumonia has been identified based on reliable microbiological methods, antimicrobial therapy should be modified and directed at the identified pathogen (BIII). Switch from Intravenous to Oral Therapy A switch to oral therapy should be considered in patients with CAP on IV antibiotic therapy who have improved clinically, can swallow and tolerate oral medications, and have intact gastrointestinal function. Suggested criteria for clinical stability include oral temperature <37.8\u00b0C, heart rate <100 beats/minute, respiratory rate <24 breaths/minute, systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, and room air oxygen saturation >90% or partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood >60 mm Hg (BII). 57 A longer duration of IV and overall Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-10antibiotic therapy is often necessary in patients who have severe CAP or who have bacteremia, particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or S. aureus and complicated infection is present. Special Considerations Regarding When to Start Antiretroviral Therapy In patients with bacterial pneumonia who are not already on ART, ART should be initiated promptly (i.e., within 2 weeks of initiating therapy for the pneumonia) unless comorbidities make ART unwise (AI). Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) The clinical response to appropriate antimicrobial therapy for CAP is similar in patients with and without HIV . 36,50 A clinical response (i.e., reduction in fever and improvement in respiratory symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory studies) typically is observed within 48 to 72 hours after initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. A review of patients with CAP found that advanced HIV infection and CD4 count <100 cells/mm 3 were predictors for longer time to clinical stability (i.e., >7 days) and that patients who received ART tended to become clinically stable sooner and had better outcomes.89,92 The presence of bacteremia is a significant factor that impacts outcomes. Among those with pneumococcal pneumonia, longer time to clinical stability is more often seen in the setting of bacteremia. As in patients without HIV , radiographic improvement usually lags behind clinical improvement. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been rarely described in association with bacterial CAP and initiation of treatment with ART in patients with HIV . This could be secondary to a number of reasons: Patients with recurrent pneumonia have not been included in the study population; IRIS among participants with bacterial pneumonia has not been specified, or This complication has truly not been observed.2,105 Only case reports describe IRIS with pneumonia due to Rhodococcus equii . More commonly IRIS occurs with pneumonia due to Pneumocystis and mycobacterial infections. Managing Treatment Failure Patients who do not respond to appropriate antimicrobial therapy should undergo further evaluation to search for complications secondary to pneumonia (empyema, abscess formation, metastatic infection), other infectious process, and/or noninfectious causes of pulmonary dysfunction (pulmonary embolus, COPD). Preventing Recurrence Patients with HIV should receive pneumococcal (AI) and influenza vaccines (AII) as recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis generally is not recommended specifically to prevent recurrences of bacterial respiratory infections because of the potential for development of drug-resistant microorganisms and drug toxicity (AI). Smoking cessation reduces the risk of bacterial pneumonia by approximately 27%, 106 and patients who smoke tobacco should be encouraged to quit and provided with the appropriate tools and referrals whenever possible (AI). Likewise, patients with substance use disorders (alcohol, injection or non-injection drugs) should be referred for appropriate counseling and services (AI). However, likely the most important intervention for prevention of bacterial pneumonia (first episode or recurrence) is initiation and adherence to ART, which is beneficial even among those with high CD4 count at time of ART initiation. 4 Thus prompt initiation or re-initiation of ART is recommended for all patients with HIV with bacterial pneumonia (AI). Special Considerations During Pregnancy The diagnosis of bacterial respiratory tract infections in pregnant women is the same as in those who are not pregnant, with appropriate shielding of the abdomen during radiographic procedures. Bacterial respiratory tract infections should be managed in pregnant women as in women who are not pregnant, with certain Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-11exceptions. Among macrolides, clarithromycin is not recommended because of an increased risk of birth defects seen in some animal studies. Two studies, each involving 100 women with first-trimester exposure to clarithromycin, did not document a clear increase in or specific pattern of birth defects, although an increased risk of spontaneous abortion was noted in one study. 107,108 Azithromycin did not produce birth defects in animal studies, but experience with human use in the first trimester is limited. Azithromycin is recommended when a macrolide is indicated in pregnancy (BIII). Arthropathy has been noted in immature animals with in utero exposure to quinolones. Studies evaluating quinolone use in pregnant women did not find an increased risk of birth defects or musculoskeletal abnormalities. 109,110 When indicated, quinolones can be used in pregnancy for serious respiratory infections only when a safer alternative is not available (CIII).111 Doxycycline is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of increased hepatotoxicity and staining of fetal teeth and bones. Beta-lactam antibiotics have not been associated with teratogenicity or increased toxicity in pregnancy. Clindamycin use in pregnancy has not been associated with an increased risk of birth defects or adverse outcomes. 112 Aminoglycosides can be used as needed. A theoretical risk of fetal renal or eighth nerve damage exists with aminoglycoside exposure during pregnancy, but this finding has not been documented in humans, except with streptomycin (10% risk) and kanamycin (2% risk). Animal reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits were negative for vancomycin, but data on first trimester exposure in humans are limited. 113 A study of neonates after in utero exposure did not find evidence of renal or ototoxicity.114 Reproductive toxicity studies of telavancin in animals have shown increased rates of limb malformations in rats, rabbits, and mini pigs at doses similar to human exposure; no human data are available. 113 Use of telavancin should be avoided in the first trimester if alternate agents with more experience in use in pregnancy are available. Cases of exposure to telavancin in pregnancy should be reported to the Telavancin Pregnancy Registry at 1-855-633-8479. Experience with linezolid in human pregnancy has been limited, but it was not teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits. Pneumonia during pregnancy is associated with increased rates of preterm labor and delivery. Pregnant women with pneumonia after 20 weeks' gestation should be monitored for evidence of contractions (BII). Pneumococcal vaccine can be administered during pregnancy (AIII) , using PPV23 for adults who have the above indications for PPV23. Although the vaccine's safety during the first trimester has not been evaluated, no adverse consequences have been reported among newborns whose mothers were inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy. No data are available to guide recommendations on the use of PCV13 during pregnancy but trial results are expected soon (NCT02717494). Inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for all pregnant women during influenza season (AIII) . Live attenuated influenza vaccine should not be used in persons with HIV (AIII) . Because administration of vaccines can be associated with a transient rise in plasma HIV RNA levels, vaccination of pregnant women is recommended after ART has been initiated to minimize increases in plasma HIV RNA levels that might increase the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV . Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-12Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Community-Acquired Pneumonia (page 1 of 3) Preventing Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections Indications for Pneumococcal Vaccination: All persons with HIV regardless of CD4 count (AI) Vaccination RecommendationsFor Individuals Who Have Not Received Any Pneumococcal VaccinationPreferred Vaccination: One dose of PCV13 (AI), followed by: count 200 cells/mm3: Administer or CD4 count <200 cells/mm3: PPV23 can be offered 8 weeks after receipt of PCV13 (CIII) or can await until CD4 count increases to >200 cells/mm3 on ART (BIII). For Individuals Who Have Previously Received PPV23: One dose of PCV13 should be given to patients who have already received PPV23 (AII). Adults (aged 19 years) should wait 1 year and adolescents (aged <19 years) should wait 8 weeks after their most recent dose of PPV23 before receiving a single dose of PCV13 (BIII). Re-Vaccination of PPV23: A dose of PPV23 is recommended for individuals aged 19 through 64 years if 5 years have elapsed since their first dose of PPV (BII). A final dose of PPV23 is recommended for individuals aged 65 years, after 5 years have elapsed since their previous PPV23 dose (BII). T ypically, no more than 3 doses of PPV23 are given in a lifetime. Vaccine Dosing: PCV13: 0.5 mL IM PPV23: 0.5 mL IM Preventing Influenza and Bacterial Pneumonia as a Complication of InfluenzaIndication for Influenza V accination: All persons with HIV infection during influenza season (AII) Vaccination: Inactivated, standard dose or recombinant influenza vaccine per recommendation of the season (AII); or High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine may be given to individuals aged 65 years (CIII). Note: Live attenuated influenza vaccine is contraindicated in persons HIV (AIII). Treating Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Note: Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be initiated promptly for patients presenting with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia. The recommendations listed below are suggested empiric therapy. The regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic and drug susceptibility results are available. Providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections (e.g., PCP , TB), which may alter the empiric therapy. Empiric Outpatient Therapy (Oral) Preferred Therapy: An oral beta-lactam plus macrolide y fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin)a (AI), especially for patients with penicillin allergies Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-13Treating Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia, continued Alternative Therapy: A beta-lactam plus Empiric Therapy IV beta-lactam respirator y fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin)a (AI), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. Alternative Therapy: An IV beta-lactam plus doxycycline (BIII) IV penicillin may be used for confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (BIII) Empiric Therapy for Patients with Severe CAPPreferred Therapy: An IV beta-lactam plus IV azithromycin (AI), or An IV beta-lactam plus an IV respirator fluoroquinolone Preferred Therapy For or levofloxacin)a (BIII) IV antipneumococcal, Beta-Lactams: Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an IV aminoglycoside plus IV azithromycin (BII), or An IV antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside plus or beta-lactam with aztreonam (BII) Empiric Therapy at MRSA PneumoniaPreferred Therapy: A nasal swab for MRSA can help inform decision of initial coverage for MRSA (see text for discussion). V ancomycin IV or linezolid (IV or PO) should be added to the baseline regimen (AII). Although not routinely recommended, the addition of clindamycin to vancomycin (but not to linezolid) may be considered for severe necrotizing pneumonia to minimize bacterial toxin production (CII).Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Community-Acquired Pneumonia (page 2 of 3) Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV G-14Duration of Therapy: For most patients, 5-7 days. The patient should be afebrile for 48-72 hours and should be clinically stable before discontinuat ion of therapy. Longer duration of antibiotics is often required when severe CAP or bacteremia is present, and particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus infection. Switch from IV to PO Therapy: A switch should be considered for patients who have improved clinically , can swallow and tolerate oral medications, and have intact gastrointestinal function (BIII). Other Considerations: Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII) , and patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have resistance due to chronic exposure (BIII). Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but who are not being treated with concurrent standard four -drug TB therapy (BIII). Once the pathogen has been identified by reliable microbiologic methods, antibiotic therapy should be modified to target the pathogen (BIII). If drug-resistant pathogens have not been identified by reliable microbiologic methods, antibiotic therapy can be de-escalate d to cover routine causes of CAP (BIII). Antibiotics chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for development of drug resistance microorganisms and drug toxicities (AI). Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Community-Acquired Pneumonia (page 3 of 3) a Respirator y fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are also active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In patients with undiagnosed TB, fluoroquinolones may alter response to therapy, delay TB diagnosis, and increase the risk of drug resistance. These drugs should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but who are not receiving a standard four-drug TB regimen.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV H-1Cryptococcosis (Last updated August 17, 2016; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Most HIV-associated cryptococcal infections are caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, but occasionally Cryptococcus gattii is the etiology. C. neoformans is found worldwide, whereas C. gattii most often is found in Australia and similar subtropical regions and in the Pacific Northwest. Before the era of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), approximately 5% to 8% of HIV-infected patients in developed countries were diagnosed with disseminated cryptococcosis. 1 Current estimates indicate that every year, nearly 1 million cases of cryptococcal meningitis are diagnosed worldwide and the disease accounts for more than 600,000 deaths. 2 With the availability of effective ART, the incidence of the disease has declined substantially in areas with ART access, and most new infections are being recognized in patients recently diagnosed with HIV infection. 3 Most cases are observed in patients who have CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <100 cells/\u00b5L. Clinical Manifestations HIV-infected cryptococcosis commonly presents as a subacute meningitis or meningoencephalitis with fever, malaise, and headache. 1 Classic meningeal symptoms and signs, such as neck stiffness and photophobia, occur in only one-quarter to one-third of patients. Some patients experience encephalopathic symptoms, such as lethargy, altered mentation, personality changes, and memory loss that are usually a result of increased intracranial pressure. Cryptococcosis usually is disseminated when diagnosed in an HIV-infected patient. Any organ of the body can be involved, and skin lesions may show myriad different manifestations, including umbilicated skin lesions mimicking molluscum contagiosum. Isolated pulmonary infection is also possible; symptoms and signs include cough and dyspnea in association with an abnormal chest radiograph, which typically demonstrates lobar consolidation, although nodular infiltrates have been reported. Pulmonary cryptococcosis may present as acute respiratory distress syndrome and mimic Pneumocystis pneumonia. Diagnosis Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generally demonstrates mildly elevated levels of serum protein, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and pleocytosis consisting mostly of lymphocytes. Some HIV-infected patients will have very few CSF inflammatory cells, but a Gram's stain preparation, or an India ink preparation if available, may demonstrate numerous yeast forms. The opening pressure in the CSF may be elevated, with pressures 25 cm H 2O occurring in 60% to 80% of patients.4,5 Cryptococcal disease can be diagnosed through culture, CSF microscopy, or by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection. In patients with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis, 55% of blood cultures and 95% of CSF cultures are positive and visible colonies can be detected within 7 days. Cryptococcus may be occasionally identified on a routine Gram stain preparation of CSF. India ink staining of CSF demonstrates encapsulated yeast in 60% to 80% of cases, but many laboratories in the United States no longer perform this test. CSF CrAg is usually positive in patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Serum CrAg is usually positive in both meningeal and non-meningeal infections and may be present weeks to months before symptom onset. 6 A positive serum CrAg should prompt a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal disease. Three methods exist for antigen detection: latex agglutination, enzyme immunoassays, and lateral flow assay (a newly developed dipstick test). Testing for the antigen in the serum is a useful initial screening tool in diagnosing cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients, 7 and it may be particularly useful when a lumbar puncture is delayed or refused. Preventing Exposure Cryptococcus is ubiquitous in the environment. HIV-infected patients cannot completely avoid exposure to Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV H-2C. neoformans or C. gattii . Limited epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to aged bird droppings may increase risk of infection. Preventing Disease The incidence of cryptococcal disease is low among HIV-infected patients in the United States. However, a recent report from the United States indicates that among HIV-infected patients with peripheral blood CD4 counts 100 cells/\u00b5L, the prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia, a harbinger of disease, was 2.9%, and prevalence was 4.3% for those with CD4 counts 50 cells/\u00b5L. 8 Routine testing for serum CrAg in newly diagnosed HIV-infected persons with no overt clinical signs of meningitis is recommended by some experts for patients whose CD4 counts are 100 cells/\u00b5L and particularly in those with CD4 counts 50 cells/\u00b5L. A positive test should prompt CSF evaluation for meningitis. Prospective, controlled trials indicate that prophylactic fluconazole or itraconazole can reduce the frequency of primary cryptococcal disease in patients who have CD4 counts <100 cells/\u00b5L. 9,10 However, in the United States, primary prophylaxis in the absence of a positive serum cryptococcal antigen test is not recommended because of the relative infrequency of cryptococcal disease, lack of survival benefit associated with prophylaxis, possibility of drug interactions, potential antifungal drug resistance, and cost (BII). Patients with isolated cryptococcal antigenemia without meningitis can be treated similarly to patients with focal pulmonary cryptococcosis (see below). Treating Disease Treating cryptococcosis consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy. For induction treatment for cryptococcal meningitis and other forms of extrapulmonary cryptococcosis, an amphotericin B formulation given intravenously, in combination with oral flucytosine, is recommended (AI). Historically, amphotericin B deoxycholate has been the preferred formulation at a dose of 0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg daily. However, there is a growing body of evidence that lipid formulations of amphotericin B are effective for disseminated cryptococcosis, particularly in patients who experience clinically significant renal dysfunction during therapy or who are likely to develop it. The non-comparative CLEAR study demonstrated a 58% response rate in HIV-infected patients treated with amphotericin B lipid complex at mean dose of 4.4 mg/kg daily. 11 In a Dutch and Australian study, a 3-week course of liposomal amphotericin B (4 mg/kg daily) resulted in more rapid sterilization of CSF than amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg daily).12 A recently published comparison amphotericin deoxycholate mg/kg daily), and liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome\u00ae) (3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg daily) showed similar efficacy for the three regimens, but nephrotoxicity was lower with 3 mg/kg daily liposomal amphotericin B. 13 Amphotericin B formulations should be combined with flucytosine at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily in 4 divided doses for 2 weeks in patients with normal renal function, and this is the preferred regimen for primary induction therapy (AI). Based on available clinical trial data, a daily dose of 3 to 4 mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended amphotericin B formulation (AI). Amphotericin B deoxycholate at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg daily is equally efficacious (AI) and can be used if cost is an issue and the risk of renal dysfunction is low. Amphotericin B lipid complex at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily can be used as an alternative amphotericin B preparation, although fewer data are available to support its use (BII). When using flucytosine, serum levels of flucytosine, if this assay is available, should be obtained 2 hours post-dose after 3 to 5 doses have been administered. Serum levels should be between 25 and 100 mg/L. 16 Renal function should be monitored closely and the flucytosine dose adjusted accordingly for patients with renal impairment. The dose of flucytosine should be reduced by 50% for every 50% decline in creatinine clearance. The addition of flucytosine to amphotericin B during acute treatment is associated with more rapid sterilization of CSF. 14-17 A recent randomized clinical trial also showed that the combination of amphotericin B deoxycholate at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg daily combined with flucytosine was associated with improved survival compared to the same dose of amphotericin B without flucytosine. 18 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV H-3Amphotericin B deoxycholate in combination with 400 mg of fluconazole daily was inferior to amphotericin B in combination with flucytosine for clearing Cryptococcus from CSF.19 However, in 2 randomized trials, amphotericin B plus 800 mg of fluconazole daily compared favorably with amphotericin B alone.19,20 Therefore, amphotericin B deoxycholate alone or combined with fluconazole at 800 mg daily (BI) or lipid- formulation amphotericin B alone or combined with fluconazole at 800 mg daily (BIII) may be viable options in some circumstances but are less preferable alternatives than lipid-formulation amphotericin B combined with flucytosine (BI). Fluconazole (400 mg daily) combined with flucytosine is also a potential alternative to amphotericin B regimens (BII). 21 Some experts would use 800 mg daily (BIII). Fluconazole alone, based on early fungicidal activity, is inferior to amphotericin B22 for induction therapy and is recommended only for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to standard treatment. If it is used for primary induction therapy, the starting daily dose should be 1200 mg (CI). 23 After at least 2 weeks of successful induction therapy\u2014defined as substantial clinical improvement and a negative CSF culture after repeat lumbar puncture\u2014amphotericin B and flucytosine can be discontinued and follow-up or consolidation therapy initiated with fluconazole at 400 mg daily (AI). This therapy should continue for at least 8 weeks (AI). 14,15,24 Subsequently, the fluconazole should be reduced to 200 mg daily and continued as chronic maintenance therapy to complete at least 1 year of azole therapy (see the Preventing Recurrence section below). 25 Itraconazole, at the same dosage as fluconazole, can be used as an alternative (CI), but it is clearly inferior to fluconazole.24 Limited data are available for the newer triazoles, voriconazole and posaconazole, as either primary or maintenance therapy for patients with cryptococcosis. Most of the data on use of these extended-spectrum triazole antifungals have been reported for treatment of refractory cases, with success rates of approximately 50%. 26,27 At this time, the role of posaconazole and voriconazole in the management of cryptococcosis is not established. V oriconazole should be used cautiously with HIV protease inhibitors and efavirenz. Non-central-nervous-system (CNS), extrapulmonary cryptococcosis, and diffuse pulmonary disease should be treated similarly to CNS disease (BIII). For mild-to-moderate symptoms and focal pulmonary infiltrates, treatment with fluconazole (400 mg daily for 12 months) combined with effective ART is appropriate (BIII). Treatment is the same for patients with an isolated positive serum cryptococcal antigen test (BIII). All patients should have their CSF sampled to rule out CNS disease. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART Optimal timing for ART initiation in patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis is controversial. One randomized, controlled trial that included 35 patients with cryptococcal meningitis suggested that ART was safe when started within the first 14 days of diagnosis. 28 A subsequent study from Africa demonstrated significantly worse outcomes in 54 patients started on ART within 72 hours of cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis compared with those in which ART was delayed for at least 10 weeks. 29 However, in the latter study, cryptococcal meningitis was managed with fluconazole alone, and ART consisted of nevirapine, stavudine, and lamivudine. Neither fluconazole alone nor the latter ART regimen are recommended as preferred initial treatment in the United States. A randomized clinical trial conducted at 2 sites in Africa among hospitalized patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis 30 compared patients with cryptococcal meningitis who were started on ART within 1 to 2 weeks (median 8 days) after fungal diagnosis with patients in whom ART was deferred until 5 weeks (median 36 days) after diagnosis. In contrast to the other African study, this study used deoxycholate amphotericin B (0.7-1.0 mg/kg daily) plus 800 mg of fluconazole daily during the induction phase of antifungal treatment. There was a significant increase in 6-month mortality in the early ART group compared with the deferred ART group (45% vs 30%, P = 0.03). This increase was most pronounced during the first 8 to 30 days of study (P = 0.007). The difference in mortality was even greater between the early ART group and the deferred ART group if the CSF white cell count was <5 cells/\u00b5L (P = 0.008). While the excess of deaths in the early ART group was attributed to cryptococcosis, it is unclear if they were directly due to meningitis and its sequelae or due to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV H-4Based on the studies cited above and on expert opinion, it is prudent to delay initiation of ART at least until after completion of antifungal induction therapy (the first 2 weeks) and possibly until the total induction/consolidation phase (10 weeks) has been completed. Delay in ART may be particularly important in those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or in those with low CSF white blood cell counts. Hence, the timing of ART administration should be considered between 2 and 10 weeks after the start of antifungal therapy with the precise starting dates based on individual conditions and local experience (BIII). If effective ART is to begin prior to 10 weeks, the treating physicians should be prepared to aggressively address complications caused by IRIS, such as elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). For other forms of cryptococcosis, where the risk of IRIS appears to be much lower, the optimal time to begin ART and antifungal therapy is not clear. However, it would seem prudent to delay initiation of ART by 2 to 4 weeks after starting antifungal therapy (BIII). All the triazole antifungals have the potential for complex, and possibly bidirectional, interactions with certain antiretroviral agents. Table 5 lists these interactions and recommendations for dosage adjustments, where feasible. Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) ICP elevations can cause clinical deterioration despite a microbiologic response, and they are more likely to occur if the CSF opening lumbar pressure is 25cm H 2O4,14 when obtained in the lateral decubitus position with good manometrics assured. In 1 large clinical trial, increased ICP was associated with 93% of deaths during the first 2 weeks of therapy and 40% of deaths during weeks 3 to 10. 4 Although it is uncertain which patients with high opening lumbar pressures will deteriorate, those with symptoms and signs of ICP require immediate clinical intervention. Lumbar opening pressure should be measured in all patients with cryptococcal meningitis at the time of diagnosis. Measures to decrease ICP should be used for all patients with confusion, blurred vision, papilledema, lower extremity clonus, or other neurologic signs of increased pressure. Drainage of CSF via lumbar puncture is recommended for initial management. One approach is to remove a volume of CSF (typically 20-30 mL) that at least halves the opening pressure 31 and repeat daily until symptoms and signs consistently improve. CSF shunting through a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate repeated lumbar punctures or in whom signs and symptoms of cerebral edema persist after multiple lumbar taps (BIII). Corticosteroids and mannitol have been shown to be ineffective in managing ICP and are not recommended (AIII) . Acetazolamide should not be used as therapy for increased ICP management since it may cause hyperchloremic acidosis and does not result in a decrease in ICP (AI). 32 A randomized study compared a 6-week course of a tapering dose of dexamethasone among 451 Asian and African patients with HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis who received amphotericin B deoxycholate plus fluconazole as the induction antifungal regimen. Compared to those receiving placebo, there was no improvement in survival at 10 weeks and dexamethasone was associated with more adverse events. 33 These data support the recommendation that corticosteroids should not routinely be used during induction therapy for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis unless they are being used for IRIS (AI). After the first 2 weeks of treatment, many experts would advocate a repeat lumbar puncture to ensure that viable organisms have been cleared from the CSF. Even in patients who have clinical improvement, positive CSF cultures after 2 weeks of therapy are predictive of future relapse and less favorable outcomes. In such cases, some experts would continue amphotericin B plus flucytosine until the CSF cultures are negative (BIII). Monitoring titers of cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen in serum or CSF is of no value in determining response to therapy and is not recommended. If new symptoms or clinical findings occur later, a repeat lumbar puncture, with measurement of opening lumbar pressure and CSF culture, should be performed. Patients treated with amphotericin B formulations should be monitored for dose-dependent nephrotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances. Pre-infusion administration of 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline appears to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during amphotericin B treatment. Thirty minutes before infusion, Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV H-5acetaminophen (650 mg) and diphenhydramine (25-50 mg) or hydrocortisone (50-100 mg) typically are administered in an attempt to ameliorate infusion-related adverse reactions (BIII), but data supporting these practices are scant. Meperidine (25-50 mg titrated during infusion) is effective for preventing and treating amphotericin B-associated rigors (BII). In patients receiving flucytosine, dosage should be adjusted based on changes in creatinine clearance and can be guided by flucytosine levels. Peak serum flucytosine levels should be obtained 2 hours after an oral dose and the therapeutic range is between 25 and 100 mg/L. Alternatively, frequent (i.e., at least biweekly) blood counts can be performed to detect development of cytopenia. Patients treated with flucytosine also should be monitored for hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicities. An estimated 30% of HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis experience IRIS after initiation or reinitiation of effective ART. 34,35 Patients who have cryptococcal IRIS are more likely to be antiretroviral naive, have higher HIV RNA levels, and have less CSF inflammation on initial presentation.36 The risk of IRIS may be decreased in those with negative CSF cultures at the time of antiretroviral initiation.37 Distinguishing IRIS from treatment failure may be difficult. In general, cryptococcal IRIS presents with worsening clinical disease despite microbiological evidence of effective antifungal therapy, 36,38 whereas treatment failure is associated with continued positive cultures. The appropriate management strategy for IRIS is to continue both ART and antifungal therapy and reduce elevated ICP, if present (AII). In patients with severe symptoms of IRIS, some specialists recommend a brief course of glucocorticosteroids (CIII) , but data-based management strategies have not been developed. The risk of IRIS appears to be much lower with other forms of cryptococcosis; IRIS may present as lymphadenitis, cutaneous abscesses, or bony lesions. 39 Management is similar to that for IRIS associated with cryptococcal meningitis, including continuing ART, initiating or continuing antifungal therapy (AIII) , and considering glucocorticoids (CIII) . Managing Treatment Failure Treatment failure is defined as a lack of clinical improvement and continued positive cultures after 2 weeks of appropriate therapy, including management of increased ICP; or as a relapse after an initial clinical response, defined as recurrence of symptoms with a positive CSF culture after 4 weeks of treatment. Direct primary fluconazole resistance with C. neoformans has been reported in the United States but is uncommon. 40 Therefore, susceptibility testing is not routinely recommended for intial management of cryptococcosis. Isolates collected to evaluate for persistence or relapse should, however, be checked for susceptibility and compared with the original isolate. While clinical data are lacking, strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations against fluconazole 16 \u00b5g/mL in patients with persistent disease or relapse may be considered resistant. 41 Optimal therapy for patients with treatment failure has not been established. Patients who fail to respond to induction with fluconazole monotherapy should be switched to amphotericin B, with or without flucytosine. Those initially treated with an amphotericin B formulation should remain on it until a clinical response occurs. Liposomal amphotericin B (4-6 mg/kg daily) or amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg daily) is better tolerated and has greater efficacy than deoxycholate formulation in this setting 12,13,42 and should be considered when initial treatment with other regimens fails (AII). Higher doses of fluconazole in combination with flucytosine also may be useful (BIII). Echinocandins have no activity against Cryptococcus spp. and are not recommended for clinical management of cryptococcosis (AII). The newer triazoles\u2014posaconazole and voriconazole\u2014have activity against Cryptococcus spp. in vitro and may have a role in salvage therapy, but probably offer no specific advantages over fluconazole unless in vitro susceptibility testing indicates fluconazole resistance. Most clinical failures are a result of inadequate induction therapy, drug interactions that interfere with treatment, or the development of IRIS and are not due to drug resistance. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV H-6Preventing Recurrence When to Start Chronic Suppressive Therapy Patients who have completed the first 10 weeks of induction and consolidation therapy for acute cryptococcosis should be given chronic maintenance or suppressive therapy with 200 mg of fluconazole daily (AI). Itraconazole is inferior to fluconazole for preventing relapse of cryptococcal disease (CI). 24 When to Stop Chronic Suppressive Therapy Only a small number of patients have been evaluated for relapse after successful antifungal therapy for cryptococcosis and discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis while on ART. In a European study, recurrence of cryptococcosis was not seen among 39 subjects on potent ART whose antifungal therapy was discontinued. In this cohort, when maintenance therapy was stopped, the median CD4 cell count was 297 cells/\u00b5L, the median HIV RNA concentration was <500 copies/mL, and the median time on potent ART was 25 months. 43 A prospective, randomized study of 60 patients in Thailand documented no recurrences of cryptococcosis during 48 weeks of follow-up among 22 patients whose antifungal therapy was discontinued after having achieved a CD4 count >100 cells/\u00b5L with a sustained undetectable HIV RNA level for 3 months on potent ART. 44 Given these data and inference from data on discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis for other HIV-associated opportunistic infections, it is reasonable to discontinue chronic antifungal maintenance therapy for cryptococcosis in patients whose CD4 cell counts are 100 cells/\u00b5L, who have undetectable viral loads on ART for >3 months, and who have received a minimum of 1 year of azole antifungal chronic maintenance therapy after successful treatment of cryptococcosis (BII). 45 Secondary prophylaxis should be reinitiated if the CD4 count decreases again to <100 cells/\u00b5L (AIII) . Special Considerations During Pregnancy The diagnosis of cryptococcal infections during pregnancy is similar to that in non-pregnant adults. Treatment should be initiated promptly after a diagnosis is confirmed. It should be emphasized that the postpartum period may be a high-risk period for the development of IRIS. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are the preferred initial regimen for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, disseminated disease, or severe pulmonary cryptococcosis in pregnant patients. Extensive clinical experience with amphotericin has not documented teratogenicity. Neonates born to women on chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. Flucytosine was teratogenic in animal studies, and human experience is limited to case reports and small series. Therefore, its use should be considered only when the benefits outweigh its risks to the fetus (CIII) . Congenital malformations similar to those observed in animals, including craniofacial and limb abnormalities, have been reported in infants born to mothers who received fluconazole at doses of 400 mg/day or more through or beyond the first trimester of pregnancy. 46 Although several cohort studies have shown no increased risk of birth defects with early pregnancy exposure, most of these studies involved low doses and short-term exposure to fluconazole. 47,48 Based on the reported birth defects, the FDA has changed the pregnancy category for fluconazole from C to D for any use other than a single, low dose for treatment of vaginal candidiasis ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm266030.htm ). Use of fluconazole in the first trimester should be considered only if the benefits clearly outweigh risks. For pregnant women, amphotericin should be continued throughout the first trimester. After the first trimester, switching to oral fluconazole may be considered, if clinically appropriate. Although there are case reports of birth defects in infants exposed to itraconazole, prospective cohort studies of over 300 women with first trimester exposure did not show an increased risk of malformation. 49,50 However, in general azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy (BIII). V oriconazole and posaconazole are teratogenic and embryotoxic in animal studies, voriconazole at doses lower than recommended human doses; there are no adequate controlled studies in humans. These drugs Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV H-7Recommendations for Treating Cryptococcosis (page 1 of 2) Treating Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for cryptococcosis consists of 3 phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy.Induction Therapy (For At Least 2 Weeks, Followed by Consolidation Therapy)Preferred Regimens: Liposomal amphotericin B 25 mg/kg PO QID (AI)\u2014if cost is an issue and the risk of renal dysfunction is low Note: Flucytosine dose should be adjusted in renal impairment (see Table 7).

When flucytosine is used, serum levels (if available) should be monitored (2 hours post-dose, after 3-5 doses) and drug concentration should be between 25-100 mg/L). Opening pressure should always be measured when a LP is per formed. Repeated LPs or CSF shunting are essential to effectively manage symptomatic increased ICP . In a randomized, controlled trial, a 6-week course of tapering doses of dexamethasone as adjunctive therapy for cr yptococcal meningitis did not improve 10-week survival when compared to placebo, and resulted in a higher rate of adverse events. Corticosteroids should not be routinely used during induction therapy unless it is used for management of IRIS (AI). Corticosteroids and mannitol are ineffective in reducing ICP and are NOT recommended (BII). Infection due to C. gattii should be treated similarly to C. neoformans (BIII). All the triazole antifungals have the potential to interact with certain antiretroviral agents and other anti-infective agents . These interactions are complex and can be bidirectional.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV I-1Cryptosporidiosis (Last updated July 16, 2019; last reviewed July 16, 2019) Epidemiology Cryptosporidiosis is caused by various species of the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium, which infect the small bowel mucosa, and, if symptomatic, the infection typically causes diarrhea. Cryptosporidium can also infect other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal sites, especially in individuals whose immune systems are suppressed. Advanced immunosuppression\u2014typically CD4 T lymphocyte cell (CD4) counts <100 cells/mm 3\u2014is associated with the greatest risk for prolonged, severe, or extraintestinal cryptosporidiosis.1 The three species that most commonly infect humans are Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. Infections are usually caused by one species, but a mixed infection is possible. 2,3 Cryptosporidiosis remains a common cause of chronic diarrhea in patients with AIDS in developing countries, with up to 74% of diarrheal stools from patients with AIDS demonstrating the organism. 4 In developed countries with low rates of environmental contamination and widespread availability of potent antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis has decreased. In the United States, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in patients with HIV is now <1 case per 1,000 person-years. 5 Infection occurs through ingestion of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Viable oocysts in feces can be transmitted directly through contact with humans or animals infected with Cryptosporidium, particularly those with diarrhea. Cryptosporidium oocysts can contaminate recreational water sources, such as swimming pools and lakes, and public water supplies and may persist despite standard chlorination. Person-to-person transmission of Cryptosporidium is common, especially among sexually active men who have sex with men. Clinical Manifestations Patients with cryptosporidiosis most commonly have acute or subacute onset of watery diarrhea, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and lower abdominal cramping. Disease severity can range from asymptomatic to profuse, cholera-like diarrhea. 6 More severe symptoms tend to occur in immune-suppressed patients, whereas transient diarrhea alone is typical in patients with competent immune systems. Fever is present in approximately one-third of patients, and malabsorption is common. The epithelium of the biliary tract and the pancreatic duct can be infected with Cryptosporidium, leading to sclerosing cholangitis and to pancreatitis secondary to papillary stenosis, particularly among patients with prolonged disease and low CD4 counts. 7 Pulmonary Cryptosporidium infections also have been reported, and may be under-recognized.8,9 Diagnosis Diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis has traditionally been made by microscopic identification of the oocysts in stool with acid-fast staining or direct immunofluorescence, which offers higher sensitivity. 10 Concentration methods (e.g., formalin-ethyl acetate) may facilitate diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Other diagnostic methods are being increasingly used. Antigen-detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunochromatographic tests also is useful; depending on the specific test, sensitivities reportedly range from 66% to 100%. However, some immunochromatographic tests are plagued by false-positive results. 11 Multiplex molecular methods are increasingly used for diagnosis, and can identify a greater number of cases than microscopic methods. 10,12 Cryptosporidial enteritis also can be diagnosed from small sections of tissue from intestinal biopsy. A single stool specimen is usually adequate to diagnosis cryptosporidiosis in individuals with profuse diarrheal illness, whereas repeat stool sampling is recommended for those with milder disease. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV I-2Preventing Exposure Individuals with HIV should be educated and counseled about the different ways that Cryptosporidium can be transmitted (BIII). Modes of transmission include direct contact with people, including diapered children, and animals infected with Cryptosporidium; swallowing contaminated water during recreational activities; drinking contaminated water; and eating contaminated food. Scrupulous handwashing can reduce the risk of diarrhea in individuals with HIV , including diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium.13 Patients with HIV should be advised to wash their hands after potential contact with human feces (including after diapering small children). Handwashing also should be recommended in association with the following activities: after handling pets or other animals, after gardening or any other contact with soil, before preparing food or eating, and before and after sex (BIII). Individuals with HIV should avoid unprotected sex, especially practices that could lead to direct (e.g., oral-anal sex) or indirect (e.g., penile-anal sex) contact with feces. They should be advised to use prophylactic barrier methods such as condoms and dental dams during sex to reduce such exposures (BIII). Individuals with HIV\u2014particularly those with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3\u2014should avoid direct contact with diarrhea or stool from pets (BIII). They should wear gloves when handling feces or cleaning areas that might have been contaminated by feces from pets (BIII). Individuals with HIV should also limit or avoid direct exposure to calves and lambs (BII). Paying attention to hygiene and avoiding direct contact with stool are important when visiting farms or petting zoos or other premises where animals are housed or exhibited. Individuals with HIV should not drink water directly from lakes or rivers (AIII) . Waterborne infection also can result from swallowing water during recreational activities. Individuals with HIV should be cautioned that lakes, rivers, salt-water beaches, some swimming pools, recreational water parks, and ornamental water fountains may be contaminated with human or animal waste that contains Cryptosporidium. They should avoid swimming in water that is likely contaminated and should avoid swallowing water while swimming or playing in recreational water (BIII). Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been linked to drinking water from municipal water supplies. During outbreaks or in other situations in which a community boil water advisory is issued, boiling water for at least 1 minute will eliminate the risk for cryptosporidiosis (AIII) . Using submicron personal-use water filters (home or office types) or bottled water also may reduce the risk of infection from water from a municipal source or a well (BII). For persons with low CD4 counts, the magnitude of the risk of acquiring cryptosporidiosis from drinking water in a non-outbreak setting is uncertain but is likely small. Available data are inadequate to recommend that all persons with HIV boil water or avoid drinking tap water in non-outbreak settings. However, individuals with HIV may consider drinking only filtered water (CIII) , despite the complexities involved in selecting appropriate water filters, the lack of enforceable standards for removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts, the costs of the products, and the difficulty of using the products consistently. Note that ice made from contaminated tap water also can be a source of infection. Patients with HIV with low CD4 counts should be cautious about eating raw oysters because cryptosporidial oocysts can survive in oysters for >2 months and have been found in oysters harvested from certain commercial oyster beds (CIII) . In the hospital setting, standard precautions for use of gloves and for handwashing after removal of gloves should be sufficient to prevent transmission of cryptosporidiosis from an infected patient to a susceptible individual with HIV (BIII). Because of the potential for fomite transmission, some specialists recommend that patients with HIV , especially individuals who are severely immunocompromised, not share a room with a patient with cryptosporidiosis (CIII) . Individuals with HIV who travel to developing countries should be warned to avoid drinking tap water or using tap water to brush their teeth (BIII). They should also avoid using ice that is not made from bottled water and consuming raw fruits or vegetables that may have been washed in tap water (BIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV I-3Individuals with HIV also should avoid other sources of Cryptosporidium oocysts as much as possible (BIII). This includes avoiding directly working with people with diarrhea; with farm animals such as cattle and sheep; and with domestic pets that are very young or have diarrhea. If exposure is unavoidable, gloves should be worn, and good hand hygiene observed. Preventing Disease Because chronic cryptosporidiosis occurs primarily in patients with advanced immunodeficiency, initiation of ART before the patient becomes severely immunosuppressed should prevent this disease (AII). Rifabutin and possibly clarithromycin taken for Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis have been found to protect against cryptosporidiosis. 14,15 Rifaximin, which is used for prevention of travelers' diarrhea, also has been used to treat cryptosporidial diarrhea. However, it is unclear whether rifaximin can protect against cryptosporidiosis. 16 Data are insufficient, however, to warrant a recommendation to use rifaximin, rifabutin, or clarithromycin as chemoprophylaxis for cryptosporidiosis. Treating Disease In the setting of severe immune suppression, ART with immune restoration to a CD4 count >100 cells/mm 3 usually leads to resolution of clinical cryptosporidiosis17-20 and is the mainstay of treatment. Patients not already taking antiretrovirals who develop cryptosporidiosis should be started on ART as part of the initial management of cryptosporidiosis (AII). Management should also include symptomatic treatment of diarrhea with anti-motility agents (AIII) . Tincture of opium may be more effective than loperamide (CIII) . Octreotide, a synthetic octapeptide analog of naturally occurring somatostatin that is approved to treat secreting tumor-induced diarrhea, is no more effective than other oral antidiarrheal agents and is usually not recommended (CII). 21 Because diarrhea can cause lactase deficiency, patients should avoid milk products (CIII) . Rehydration and repletion of electrolyte losses by either the oral or intravenous route are important. Stool volume in patients with AIDS with severe diarrhea can exceed 10 L/day; managing the diarrhea often requires intensive support. Oral rehydration should be pursued aggressively with oral rehydration solutions (AIII) . Most patients can be treated with enteral nutrition; total parenteral nutrition is rarely indicated (CIII) . with biliary tract involvement may require endoscopic retrograde choledocoduodenoscopy for diagnosis. They may also benefit from sphincterotomy, stenting, or both. 7,22 Several agents, including nitazoxanide, paromomycin, and spiramycin, have been investigated in small, randomized controlled clinical trials of adults with HIV . No pharmacologic or immunologic therapy directed specifically against Cryptosporidium has been shown to be consistently effective when used without ART. 23 Nitazoxanide is an orally administered nitrothiazole benzamide with in vivo activity against a broad range of helminths, bacteria, and protozoa. Nitazoxanide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of cryptosporidiosis in children and adults. Nitazoxanide 500 mg administered twice daily for 3 days to adults without HIV with cryptosporidiosis resulted in higher rates of diarrhea resolution and oocyst-free stools than placebo. 24,25 In one study, adults with HIV with cryptosporidiosis with CD4 counts >50 cells/ mm3 were treated with nitazoxanide 500 mg to 1,000 mg twice daily for 14 days; the nitazoxanide treatment group had substantially higher rates of parasitological cure and resolution of diarrhea than the placebo group. 26 Efficacy of nitazoxanide for the treatment of cryptosporidial diarrhea in children with HIV was not confirmed, however, in two randomized trials in children.27,28 Data from a compassionate use program before the advent of potent ART, which included primarily white male adults with median CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm 3, reported that a majority of patients experienced some degree of clinical response (reduction in frequency of total stool and of liquid stools), usually within the first week of treatment.29 Adverse events associated with nitazoxanide are limited and typically mild, and no important drug-drug interactions have been reported. Because of the clinical significance of cryptosporidiosis, many experts will institute a trial Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV I-4of nitazoxanide or paromomycin in conjunction with ART, but never instead of ART, despite the paucity of evidence that such antiparasitic therapy is beneficial (CIII) . Paromomycin is a non-absorbable aminoglycoside indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis but not specifically approved for cryptosporidiosis. Paromomycin in high doses is effective for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in animal models. A meta-analysis of 11 published studies of paromomycin in humans reported a response rate of 67%; however, there were few cures, relapses were common, and long-term success rates were only 33%. 22 Two randomized trials comparing paromomycin with placebo demonstrated limited effectiveness of the drug among patients with AIDS and cryptosporidiosis.23,30,31 One case series suggested a better response rate in patients receiving paromomycin along with ART.32 Paromomycin may be used instead of nitazoxanide in conjunction with ART, but never instead of ART (CIII). Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART As noted above, patients with cryptosporidiosis should be offered ART as part of the initial management of cryptosporidiosis (AII). In vitro and in animal models, PIs can inhibit Cryptosporidium, but there is no clinical evidence that PI-based ART is preferable in patients with documented cryptosporidiosis (CIII) . 33,34 Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (including IRIS) Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and malnutrition. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been described in association with 3 cases of extra-intestinal cryptosporidiosis. 35 Managing Treatment Failure Supportive treatment and optimization of ART to achieve full virologic suppression are the main approaches to managing treatment failure (AIII) . The clinical response rather than results of stool tests should be used to guide the response to therapy. Some authorities advocate adding anti-parasitic drugs (CIII) , such as nitazoxanide or paromomycin alone or in combination with azithromycin, as well as optimizing ART in patients with treatment failure and cryptosporidiosis. 36,37 Preventing Recurrence No pharmacologic interventions are known to be effective in preventing the recurrence of cryptosporidiosis. Special Considerations During Pregnancy Rehydration and initiation of ART are the mainstays of initial treatment of cryptosporidiosis during pregnancy, as they are in non-pregnant women (AII). Pregnancy should not preclude the use of ART and in fact is always an indication for ART. Nitazoxanide is not teratogenic in animals but no data on use in human pregnancy are available. Nitazoxanide can be used in pregnancy after the first trimester in women with severe symptoms (CIII) . Limited information is available about the teratogenic potential of paromomycin, but oral administration is associated with minimal systemic absorption, which may minimize potential risk. Paromomycin can be used in pregnancy after the first trimester in women with severe symptoms (CIII) . Loperamide is poorly absorbed and has not been associated with birth defects in animal studies. However, one study identified an increased risk of congenital malformations, and specifically hypospadias, among 683 women with exposure to loperamide early in pregnancy. 38 Therefore, loperamide should be avoided in the first trimester, unless benefits are felt to outweigh potential risks (CIII) . Loperamide is the pregnancy (CIII) . Opiate exposure in late pregnancy has been associated with neonatal respiratory depression, and chronic exposure may result in neonatal withdrawal, therefore tincture of opium is not recommended in late pregnancy (AIII) . 38 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV I-5Recommendations for Preventing and Managing Cryptosporidiosis Preventing Chronic Cryptosporidiosis Because chronic cr yptosporidiosis occurs primarily in persons with advanced immunodeficiency, initiation of ART before the patient becomes severely immunosuppressed should prevent the disease (AII). Managing Cryptosporidiosis Preferred Management Strategies: Aggressive oral and/or IV rehydration and replacement of electrolyte loss (AIII), and Symptomatic treatment of diarrhea with anti-motility agent (AIII); tincture of opium may be more effective than loperamide (CIII), and Initiation or optimization of ART for immune restoration to CD4 count >100 cells/mm3 (AII) Consider: Nitazoxanide 500 mg to 1,000 mg PO twice daily with food for 14 days (CIII) plus optimized ART, symptomatic treatment, and rehydration and electrolyte replacement, or Paromomycin 500 mg PO four times a day for 14 days-21 days (CIII) plus optimized ART, symptomatic treatment, and rehydration and electrolyte replacement Other Considerations: Because diarrhea can cause lactase deficiency, patients should avoid milk products (CIII).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV J-1Cystoisosporiasis (Formerly Isosporiasis) (Last updated September 10, 2015; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Isosporiasis, also known as cystoisosporiasis, occurs worldwide but predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions. Immunocompromised patients, including those who are HIV-infected, are at increased risk for chronic, debilitating illness. 1-7 Although Isospora (Cystoisospora) belli completes its life cycle in humans, the oocysts shed in the feces of infected individuals must mature (sporulate) outside the host, in the environment, to become infective. On the basis of limited data, the maturation process is completed in approximately 1 to 2 days but might occur more rapidly in some settings. 2 Infection results from ingestion of sporulated oocysts, such as from contaminated food or water. After ingestion, the parasite invades enterocytes in the small intestine. Ultimately, immature oocysts are produced and shed in stool. Clinical Manifestations The most common manifestation is watery, non-bloody diarrhea, which may be associated with abdominal pain, cramping, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. The diarrhea can be profuse and prolonged, particularly in immunocompromised patients, resulting in severe dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, weight loss, and malabsorption. 6-12 Acalculous cholecystitis/cholangiopathy2,13-15 and reactive arthritis16 also have been reported. Diagnosis Typically, infection is diagnosed by detecting Isospora oocysts (dimensions, 23-36 \u00b5m by Oocysts may be shed intermittently and at low levels, even by patients with profuse diarrhea. Diagnosis can be facilitated by repeated stool examinations with sensitive methods, such as modified acid-fast techniques, on which oocysts stain bright red, and UV fluorescence microscopy, under which they autofluoresce. 2,17 Infection also can be diagnosed by detecting oocysts in duodenal aspirates/ mucus or developmental stages of the parasite in intestinal biopsy specimens.2,10 Extraintestinal infection, such as in the biliary tract, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, has been documented in postmortem examinations of HIV-infected patients. 2,18-20 Preventing Exposure Because I. belli is acquired by ingesting infected water or food, avoiding potentially contaminated food or water in isosporiasis-endemic areas may help prevent infection. Preventing Disease In some settings, chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been associated with a lower incidence or prevalence of isosporiasis. 1,3,4,21 In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, daily TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) was protective against isosporiasis in persons with early-stage HIV infection (World Health Organization clinical stage 2 or 3 at enrollment). 1 In an observational study, incidence of isosporiasis decreased after widespread introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), except in patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm 3.3 After adjustment for the CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count, the risk of isosporiasis was substantially lower in those receiving prophylaxis with TMP-SMX, sulfadiazine, or pyrimethamine (unspecified regimens). In analyses of data from a Los Angeles county AIDS surveillance registry during the pre-ART era, the prevalence of isosporiasis was lower in patients with versus without a history of Pneumocystis pneumonia\u2014indirect evidence of a protective effect from use of TMP-SMX for Pneumocystis pneumonia. 4 Insufficient evidence is available, however, to support a general recommendation for primary prophylaxis for isosporiasis per se, especially for U.S. travelers in isoporiasis-endemic areas. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV J-2Treating Disease Clinical management includes fluid and electrolyte support for dehydrated patients and nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients (AIII) . TMP-SMX is the antimicrobial agent of choice for treatment of isosporiasis (AI). It is the only agent whose use is supported by substantial published data and clinical experience. Therefore, potential alternative therapies should be reserved for patients with documented sulfa intolerance or in whom treatment fails (AIII) . Three studies in HIV-infected patients in Haiti have demonstrated the effectiveness of various treatment regimens of TMP-SMX. 6,7,22 The patients were not receiving ART, and laboratory indicators of immunodeficiency (such as CD4 cell counts) were not specified. On the basis of the initial studies,6,7 the traditional treatment regimen has been a 10-day course of TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered orally four times daily (AII). 23 In another study, TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered twice daily was also effective (BI).22 Although published experience using two daily doses of TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) is limited, one approach would be to start with this regimen but to increase the daily dose and the duration of therapy (up to 3-4 weeks) 6,10 if symptoms worsen or persist (BIII). Intravenous administration of TMP-SMX should be considered for patients with potential or documented malabsorption. Limited data suggest that therapy with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine may be effective.2,9,10,24-26 However, the combination of pyrimethamine plus sulfadoxine is not typically recommended for use in the United States (CIII) ; it has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome,27 and pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine clear slowly from the body after therapy is discontinued. Single-agent therapy with pyrimethamine has been used, with anecdotal success for treatment and prevention of isosporiasis. 3,28,29 may be an effective treatment alternative; it is the option for sulfa-intolerant patients (BIII). The author panel has issued a statement on the availability of pyrimethamine. For more information, please visit https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/news/1604/notice-of-availability-of-pyrimethamine. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART Only limited data address the utility of ART in the setting of Isospora and HIV co-infection.3,14,21 Immune reconstitution with ART may result in fewer relapses of isosporiasis, and no cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) have been reported. Therefore, the potential benefits of ART likely outweigh the risks. For patients with isosporiasis who otherwise fulfill criteria for ART, TMP-SMX therapy and ART can be started simultaneously; there is no known reason to defer initiation of ART other than the potential for poor ART absorption (AIII) . Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Patients should be monitored for clinical response and adverse events. In HIV-infected patients, TMP-SMX therapy is commonly associated with side effects, such as rash, fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminase levels. IRIS has not been described. Managing Treatment Failure If symptoms worsen or persist despite approximately 5 to 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy, the possibilities of noncompliance, malabsorption, and concurrent infections/enteropathies should be considered; the TMP-SMX regimen (daily dose, duration, and mode of administration) also should be reevaluated. For patients with documented sulfa intolerance or in whom treatment fails, use of a potential alternative agent (typically pyrimethamine) should be considered. Ciprofloxacin is a second-line agent (CI). On the basis of limited data from a randomized, controlled trial in Haiti, ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for 7 days) is less effective than TMP-SMX but may have modest activity against I. belli . 22 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV J-3Unsubstantiated or mixed data are available for albendazole,29-31 nitazoxanide,32,33 doxycycline,34 diclazuril quinacrine, iodoquinol, paromomycin, and furazolidone are ineffective.8,25,26,28,35,37 Apparent or partial responses, if noted, may be attributable to treatment of concomitant infections or to nonspecific effects. Preventing Recurrence Patients with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm3 should receive secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) with TMP-SMX, which is also protective against Pneumocystis jirovecii and Toxoplasma gondii infections (AI). In studies in Haiti, approximately 50% of patients who did not receive secondary prophylaxis had symptomatic recurrences approximately 2 months after completing a course of TMP-SMX therapy, relapses rapidly responded to retreatment, and secondary prophylaxis decreased the risk of relapse. 6,7,22 In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, no symptomatic recurrences were noted in patients who received maintenance therapy with thrice-weekly TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) (AI). 7 Daily TMP-SMX (160/800 thrice-weekly TMP-SMX (320/1600 mg) have been (BIII);5,10 however, clinical and parasitologic relapses despite maintenance TMP-SMX therapy and ART have been sulfa-intolerant patients, pyrimethamine (25 mg/day) with leucovorin (5-10 mg/day) has been used (BIII). 28 On the basis of limited data, ciprofloxacin (500 mg thrice weekly) is considered a second-line alternative (CI).22 When To Stop Secondary Prophylaxis The issue of discontinuing prophylaxis has not been evaluated in a clinical trial. Chemoprophylaxis probably can be safely discontinued in patients without evidence of active I. belli infection who have a sustained increase in the CD4 cell count to levels >200 cells/mm 3 for >6 months after initiation of ART (BIII). Special Considerations During Pregnancy TMP-SMX is the agent of choice for primary treatment and secondary prophylaxis in pregnant women, as it is in persons who are not pregnant. Although first-trimester exposure to trimethoprim has been associated with a small increased risk of birth defects, 39-42 TMP-SMX therapy should be provided in the setting of maternal symptomatic I. belli infection. Because of concerns about possible teratogenicity associated with first-trimester drug exposure, clinicians may withhold secondary prophylaxis during the first trimester and treat only symptomatic infection (CIII) . Although pyrimethamine has been associated with birth defects in animals, limited human data have not suggested an increased risk of defects. 43 Human data about the use of ciprofloxacin during several hundred pregnancies have not suggested an increased risk of birth defects or cartilage abnormalities. 44 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV J-4Treating Isospora belli Infection General Management Considerations: Fluid and electrolyte support in patients with dehydration (AIII) Nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients (AIII) Preferred Therapy for Acute Infection: TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO (or IV) QID for 10 days (AII), or TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO (or IV) BID for 7-10 days (BI) One approach is to start with TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) BID regimen first, and increase daily dose and/or duration (up to 3-4 weeks) if symptoms worsen or persist (BIII) IV therapy for patients with potential or documented malabsorption Alternative Therapy For Acute Infection (For Patients with Sulfa Intolerance): Pyrimethamine 50-75 mg PO daily + leucovorin 10-25 mg PO daily (BIII), or Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID for 7 days (CI) Chronic Maintenance Therapy (Secondary Prophylaxis) (In Patients with CD4 Count <200/mm3) Preferred Therapy: TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO 3 times weekly (AI) Alternative Therapy: TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO daily (BIII), or TMP-SMX (320 mg/1600 mg) PO 3 times weekly (BIII), or Pyrimethamine 25 mg PO daily + leucovorin 5-10 mg PO daily (BIII) Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO 3 times weekly (CI) as a second line alternative Criteria for Discontinuation of Chronic Maintenance Therapy Sustained increase in CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 for >6 months in response to ART and without evidence of active I. belli infection (BIII)Recommendations for Treating Isospora belli Infection Key to Acronyms: ART = antiretroviral therapy; BID = twice daily; IV = intravenous; PO = orally; QID = four times a day; = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole References 1.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-1Cytomegalovirus Disease (Last updated November 4, 2015; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus in the herpes virus family that can cause disseminated or localized end-organ disease in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression. Most clinical disease occurs in individuals previously infected with CMV (seropositive) and therefore represents either re-activation of latent infection or re-infection with a novel strain. End-organ disease caused by CMV occurs in patients with advanced immunosuppression, typically those with CD4 T lymphocyte cell (CD4) counts <50 cells/mm 3, who are either not receiving or have failed to respond to antiretroviral therapy (ART).1-3 Other risk factors include previous opportunistic infections (OIs), a high level of CMV viremia (most often measured by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), and high plasma HIV RNA levels (>100,000 copies/mL). Before potent ART, an estimated 30% of patients with AIDS experienced CMV retinitis sometime between the diagnosis of AIDS and death. 1-3 The incidence of new cases of CMV end-organ disease has declined by 95% with the advent of ART.4,5 For those with established CMV retinitis, recurrence of active lesions occurs at a rate substantially lower than that seen in the pre-ART era. However, even for those with immune recovery sufficient to discontinue anti-CMV therapy, that is, CD4+ counts >100 cells/mm 3, relapse of the retinitis occurs at a rate of 0.03/person-year and occasionally can occur at CD4 counts as high as 1,250 cells/mm3.6 Therefore, whether anti-CMV therapy is continued or not, regular ophthalmologic follow-up is needed. Clinical Manifestations Retinitis is the most common clinical manifestation of CMV end-organ disease in HIV-infected patients. It occurs as unilateral disease in two-thirds of patients at presentation, but disease ultimately is bilateral in most patients in the absence of therapy or immune recovery. 6 In patients with unilateral CMV retinitis and CD4 count <50 cells/mm3, rates of approach those of the pre-ART era.6 Peripheral retinitis may be asymptomatic or present with floaters, scotomata, or peripheral visual field defects. Central retinal lesions or lesions impinging on the macula or optic nerve are associated with decreased visual acuity or central field defects. CMV retinitis is a full-thickness necrotizing retinitis, and the characteristic ophthalmologic appearance is that of fluffy, yellow-white retinal lesions, with or without intraretinal hemorrhage, with little inflammation of the vitreous unless immune recovery with ART intervenes. 1 Blood vessels near the lesions may appear to be sheathed. Occasionally, CMV retinitis lesions, particularly peripheral lesions, may have a more granular appearance. In the absence of ART or specific anti-CMV therapy, retinitis invariably progresses, usually within 10 to 21 days after presentation. Progression of retinitis occurs in fits and starts and causes a characteristic brushfire pattern, with a granular, white leading edge advancing before an atrophic gliotic scar. 7 Colitis occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with AIDS and CMV end-organ disease.2 The most frequent clinical manifestations are weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, debilitating diarrhea, and malaise. In the colon, and especially in the cecum, CMV can produce perforation and present as an acute abdomen. If CMV colitis is present, computed tomography may show colonic thickening. Hemorrhage and perforation can be life-threatening complications. Esophagitis occurs in a small percentage of patients with AIDS who experience CMV end-organ disease and causes odynophagia, nausea, and occasionally midepigastric or retrosternal discomfort. Colitis and esophagitis may cause fever. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-2CMV pneumonitis is extremely uncommon. CMV is detected frequently in the bronchoalveolar lavage but is a bystander most of the time and should trigger a search for a more likely causative agent. CMV neurologic disease includes dementia, ventriculoencephalitis, and polyradiculomyelopathies.8 Patients with dementia caused by CMV encephalitis typically have lethargy, confusion, and fever. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically demonstrates lymphocytic pleocytosis (although a mixture of neutrophils and lymphocytes might be evident), low-to-normal glucose levels, and normal-to-elevated protein levels. Patients with ventriculoencephalitis have a more acute course, with focal neurologic signs, often including cranial nerve palsies or nystagmus, and rapid progression to death. Periventricular enhancement of computed tomography or magnetic resonance images is highly suggestive ventriculoencephalitis rather than HIV-related neurologic causes a Guillian-Barre-like syndrome characterized by urinary retention and progressive bilateral leg weakness. Clinical symptoms usually progress over several weeks to include loss of bowel and bladder control and flaccid paraplegia. A spastic myelopathy has been reported and sacral paresthesia can occur. The CSF in CMV polyradiculopathy neutrophilic pleocytosis (usually 100-200 neutrophils/\u00b5L and some erythrocytes) accompanied by hypoglycorrhachia and elevated protein levels. Diagnosis CMV viremia can be detected by PCR, antigen assays, or culture and is usually, but not invariably, present in end-organ disease. Viremia as detected by one of these assays can be present in disease-free patients with low CD4 cell counts\u2014that is, in the absence of end-organ disease. 8-13 Blood tests to detect CMV by antigen detection, culture, or PCR are not recommended for diagnosis of CMV end-organ disease because of their poor positive predictive value. A negative serum or plasma PCR assay also does not rule out CMV end-organ disease. Of note, patients with CMV retinitis have CMV DNA detected in the vitreous in around 80% of cases, but in only 70% in the blood, with the remaining cases diagnosed by clinical criteria plus response to therapy. 14,15 CMV PCR can be particularly useful in assessing CSF or vitreous or aqueous humor specimens; a positive result is highly suggestive that CMV is the cause of end-organ disease. However, PCR assays are not standardized; therefore, sensitivity, specificity, and interassay comparability are not clearly delineated. Presence of serum antibodies to CMV is not diagnostically useful, although a negative immunoglobulin G antibody level indicates that CMV is unlikely to be the cause of the disease process. CMV retinitis usually is diagnosed based on recognition of characteristic retinal changes observed through a dilated pupil during an ophthalmoscopic examination performed by an experienced ophthalmologist. Diagnosis in that setting has a 95% positive predictive value. In rare cases, diagnosis may be difficult and PCR of aqueous or vitreous specimens for CMV and herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and toxoplasmosis\u2014can be useful for establishing the diagnosis. CMV colitis is usually diagnosed based on demonstration of mucosal ulcerations on endoscopic examination, combined with with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. 2,16 CMV esophagitis is diagnosed of of the distal esophagus and biopsy evidence of intranuclear inclusion bodies in the endothelial cells with an inflammatory reaction at the edge of the ulcer.2 Specimens may contain many inclusion bodies or rare, isolated inclusion bodies. The significance of such inclusion bodies is determined by clinical judgment plus the presence or absence of other plausible etiologies. Culturing CMV from a biopsy or cells brushed from the colon or the esophagus is insufficient to establish the diagnosis of CMV colitis or esophagitis in the absence of histopathologic changes because a substantial number of patients with low CD4 cell counts may have positive cultures in the absence of clinical disease. 13 The diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis is difficult and requires consistent clinical and radiological findings (i.e., diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates, fever, and cough or dyspnea), identification of multiple CMV inclusion bodies in lung tissue or cytology, and the absence of any other pathogens that are more commonly associated with pneumonitis. 11 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-3CMV neurologic disease is diagnosed on the basis of a compatible clinical syndrome and the presence of CMV in CSF or brain tissue, most often evaluated with PCR.3,9,12 Preventing Exposure HIV-infected patients who belong to groups with relatively low seroprevalence rates for CMV and, therefore, cannot be presumed to be seropositive may be tested for antibody to CMV (BIII). That includes individuals who have not had contact with men who have sex with men or used injection drugs, and patients without extensive exposure to children in day care centers. HIV-infected adolescents and adults should be advised that CMV is shed in semen, cervical secretions, and saliva and that latex condoms must always be used during sexual contact to reduce the risk of exposure to CMV as well as other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). HIV-infected adults and adolescents who are CMV-seronegative and provide child care (or are parents of children in day care facilities) should be informed that they are at increased risk of acquiring CMV infection (BI). Risk of acquiring CMV infection can be diminished with optimal hygienic practices, such as handwashing and use of latex gloves (AIII) . HIV-infected adolescents, and adults who are seronegative for CMV and who require blood transfusion should be given only CMV antibody-negative or leukocyte-reduced cellular blood products in nonemergency situations (BIII). Preventing Disease CMV end-organ disease is best prevented using ART to maintain the CD4 count >100 cells/mm3. Before ART was widely available, daily use of oral ganciclovir (no longer marketed in the United States) for primary prophylaxis significantly reduced incidence of CMV disease in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 17 However, such prophylactic therapy never became standard of care because of the cost, toxicity, and number-needed-to-treat to reduce disease. More recently, another randomized, placebo-controlled trial addressed whether valganciclovir (the current standard oral agent for treatment of CMV disease) might reduce CMV end-organ disease in AIDS patients at high risk (CD4 count <100 cells/mm 3 and CMV viremia detected by plasma CMV DNA PCR assay) in the era of modern ART.18 This study failed to show a benefit for such preventive therapy; therefore, valganciclovir primary prophylaxis is not recommended either in patients who will be receiving ART, or in patients who will not be receiving ART (AI). The primary method for preventing severe CMV disease is recognizing the early manifestations of the disease and instituting proper therapy. Patients should be made aware of the implications of increased floaters in the eye and should be advised to assess their visual acuity regularly using simple techniques, such as reading newsprint (BIII). In the pre-modern ART era, some specialists recommended ophthalmologic examinations every 3 ro 4 months for patients with CD4 cells <50 cells/mm 3, as up to one-half of early CMV retinitis was asymptomatic (CIII) . However, with the decline in CMV incidence in the modern ART era, the value of this recommendation is unknown. Treating Disease CMV retinitis should ideally be treated with the active participation of an opthalmologist who is familiar with the diagnosis and management of retinal disease. Oral valganciclovir (AI), intravenous (IV) ganciclovir (AI), IV ganciclovir followed by oral valganciclovir (AI), IV foscarnet (AI), and IV cidofovir (BI) are all effective treatments for CMV retinitis. 7,19-26 The ganciclovir implant, a surgically-implanted reservoir of ganciclovir, which lasts approxiamately 6 months, also is very effective but it no longer is being manufactured. In its absence, some clinicians will use intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet in conjunction with oral valganciclovir, at least initially, to provide immediate high intraocular levels of drug and presumably faster control of the retinitis (AIII) . The choice of initial therapy for CMV retinitis should be individualized based on the location and severity of the lesion(s), the level of underlying immune suppression, and other factors such as concomitant Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-4medications and ability to adhere to treatment (AIII) . Systemic therapy has been documented to reduce CMV involvement of the contralateral eye,19 to reduce CMV visceral disease, and to improve survival.20,27 Prevention of contralateral eye involvement, visceral disease, and the benefits on survival should be considered when choosing among oral, IV , and local options. Given the evident benefits of systemic treatment, when medically and logistically feasible, treatment regimens for CMV retinitis should include a systemic component. There have been few comparative trials comparing regimen efficacy during the past 15 years. None of the listed regimens has been proven, in a clinical trial, to have superior efficacy related to protecting vision. Thus, clinical judgment must be used when choosing a regimen. 21-25 Early clinical trials were conducted with oral ganciclovir, a preparation with poor bioavailability that is no longer marketed in the United States. In these guidelines, valganciclovir has replaced oral ganciclovir in recommendations even though the best data in some situations come from early trials with oral ganciclovir. In studies conducted in the pre-ART era, 23 ganciclovir intraocular implant (no longer available) plus oral ganciclovir was superior to once-daily IV ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis. Assuming that this observation can be extended to other combinations of systemically and locally administered drugs, HIV specialists often recommend intravitreal ganciclovir or foscarnet injections plus oral valganciclovir as the preferred initial therapy for patients with immediate sight-threatening lesions (within 1500 microns of the fovea) (AIII). Intravitreal injections deliver high concentrations of the drug to the target organ immediately while steady-state concentrations in the eye are achieved with systemically delivered medications. 19 For patients with small peripheral lesions, oral valganciclovir alone often is adequate (AI). Because ART can control CMV retinitis without anti-CMV therapy in patients who develop substantial immune recovery, some clinicians may consider not treating small peripheral CMV lesions with anti-CMV therapy in ART-naive patients who are initiating ART. However, this strategy has multiple potential drawbacks: ART can take 3 to 6 months to fully control HIV replication and stimulate sufficient immune recovery to control the retinitis. Ocular complications, such as immune recovery uveitis (IRU) and retinal detachment are related to lesion size, so minimizing lesion size with anti-CMV therapy until there is sufficient immune recovery to control the retinitis is logical. Furthermore, evidence from both the pre-ART and ART eras demonstrate that specific anti-CMV therapy decreases mortality among patients with CMV retinitis and immune compromise. 13,20,26,28 In addition data from the ART era demonstrate that the use of systemic therapy for patients with CMV retinitis is associated with decreased retinitis progression, contralateral eye involvement, and visceral disease, as well as a reduction in mortality. 27 Moreover, some reports in the current era indicate that only 50% of some patient populations with CMV retinitis will experience immune recovery sufficient to meet criteria for discontinuation of anti-CMV therapy. 29 Therefore, even in ART-naive patients with small peripheral lesions, treatment with systemic anti-CMV therapy, such as oral valganciclovir for the first 3 to 6 months until ART has induced immune recovery will be beneficial (AII). Systemic therapy is given twice daily for the first 14 to 21 days (induction) followed by once daily dosing (maintenance) until immune reconstitution occurs (see When to Stop Maintenance Therapy below). For patients who have colitis or esophagitis, many HIV specialists recommend anti-CMV therapy for 21 to 42 days (CII) or until signs and symptoms have resolved. Some HIV specialists would withhold therapy for mild disease if ART is to be initiated soon or can be optimized (CIII) . IV ganciclovir generally is the therapy of choice, therapy can be switched to oral valganciclovir once the patient can tolerate oral medications (BI); foscarnet can be used as an alternative if ganciclovir-related toxicity is treatment limiting or in unusual cases of ganciclovir-resistant virus (BIII). Oral valganciclovir can be used in patients with mild disease (BIII). Experience treating well-documented CMV pneumonia in patients with HIV infection is limited and anecdotal. Treatment with IV ganciclovir, or alternatively, with foscarnet, is logical (CIII) . The optimal duration of therapy and the role of oral valganciclovir have not been established. Therapy for well-documented neurologic disease also has not been extensively studied. Given the poor outcomes in many patients with CMV-related neurologic disease, some experts would initiate therapy with both IV ganciclovir and IV foscarnet, despite the substantial toxicities associated with such an approach Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-5(CIII) . Optimizing ART is important, as in all types of CMV disease (BIII). The optimal duration of therapy and the role of oral valganciclovir have not been established. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting Antiretroviral Therapy Visual impairment caused by complications of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), such as macular edema, may occur in patients who have active CMV retinitis and those who have had CMV retinitis in the recent or distant past. One historical controlled study suggested a substantial increase in immune reconstitution uveitis (IRU, described below) in association with immediate as opposed to deferred initiation of ART (71% vs. 31%), 30 suggesting that a delay in therapy until retinitis was controlled might be beneficial in reducing the likelihood or severity of IRU. However, this strategy must be weighed against the potential for occurrence of other OIs if ART initiation is delayed. CMV replication usually is controlled within 1 to 2 weeks after anti-CMV therapy is initiated, and in the current era, the rate of clinically significant IRU following initiation of ART appears to be low (approximately 0.04 per person-year). 29 Most experts would not delay ART for more than 2 weeks after starting anti-CMV therapy for retinitis or for other end-organ diseases caused by CMV (CIII) . IRIS is a particular concern with any neurologic disease, including CMV encephalitis, ventriculitis, and radiculitis. In these cases, however, most experts would not defer initiation of ART for more than 2 weeks, although clinical judgment based on individual cases is needed (CIII) . Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Indirect ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil should be performed at the time of diagnosis of CMV retinitis, 2 weeks after initiating therapy, and monthly thereafter while the patient is on anti-CMV treatment. The purpose of such examinations is to evaluate efficacy of treatment and to detect complications such as retinal detachment. Monthly fundus photographs, using a standardized technique that documents the appearance of the retina, provide the optimum method for following patients and detecting early relapse. For patients who have experienced immune recovery, the frequency of ophthalmologic follow-up can be decreased to every 3 months, but clinicians should be aware that relapses and other retinal complications still occasionally occur in patients with immune reconstitution. Adverse effects of ganciclovir/valganciclovir include anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, diarrhea, and renal dysfunction. Ganciclovir-related neutropenia often can be reversed with hematopoietic growth factors. 31,32 Adverse effects of foscarnet include nephrotoxicity, and electrolyte abnormalities; seizures occur, characteristically in the context of renal insufficiency, and anemia. In patients receiving ganciclovir or foscarnet, complete blood counts, serum electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus), and renal function should be monitored twice weekly during induction and at least once weekly during maintenance therapy (AIII). Cidofovir is associated with dose-related nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, uveitis, and hypotony. In patients receiving IV cidofovir, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels should be tested and urinalysis performed before each infusion; drug administration is contraindicated if renal dysfunction or significant proteinuria is detected. IV cidofovir requires prehydration and oral probenecid before administration. Periodic ophthalmologic examinations are needed to monitor for cidofovir-associated uveitis or hypotony even when organ dysfunction does not appear to include retinitis. Intraocular injections can be associated with bacterial or fungal infections, hemorrhage, or retinal detachment. As noted previously, patients with CMV retinitis must have careful ophthalmologic monitoring to detect and manage the wide range of complications related to CMV , the drugs used to treat CMV , and IRIS. IRU, an ocular form of IRIS presumed to be an adverse immunologic reaction to CMV , is characterized by inflammation in the anterior chamber or vitreous in the setting of immune recovery after initiation of ART. IRU usually is observed in patients with a substantial rise in CD4 cell count in the first 4 to 12 weeks after initiation of ART. 33-37 The estimated incidence of IRU is 0.02/person-year after immune recovery.38 Ocular complications of IRU include macular edema and development of epiretinal membranes, which can cause loss of vision. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-6Treatment of IRU usually consists of some type of corticosteroid therapy. The benefit of anti-CMV therapy is unclear.33,39 Many experts would use both corticosteroids and anti-CMV therapy (CIII) . Data are insufficient on which to base a recommendation regarding the preferred route of corticosteroid administration; periocular, intravitreal, and oral administration all have been reported to be potentially successful. When oral corticosteroids are used, a short course rather than chronic therapy usually is recommended (BIII). 40 IRU can occur even months or years after successful treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with a history of CMV retinitis who subsequently start taking ART or have such therapy optimized. Early after the initiation of ART, patients remain at risk for development of CMV retinitis. 41 Development of CMV retinitis in the setting of recent ART initiation should be treated with systemic anti-CMV therapy, similarly to any patient with CMV retinitis, and continuing the same ART regimen (AI). Corticosteroids are not recommended (AIII) . In addition, in the absence of uveitis, corticosteroids should not be used in patients undergoing treatment for CMV retinitis who have worsening of retinitis upon ART initiation. In this situation, anti-CMV therapy and ART regimens should be continued (AIII) . Managing Treatment Failure Failure of therapy for CMV retinitis or relapse is most likely in patients who do not have substantial immune reconstitution after initiation or optimization of ART.42 Treatment failure also may be a result of inadequate anti-CMV drug levels in the eye or CMV drug resistance. Many experts believe that early relapse is most often caused by the limited intraocular penetration of systemically administered drugs. 39,43,44 When relapse occurs in patients receiving maintenance therapy, retinitis usually can be controlled with re-induction with the same drug as used for maintenance followed by re-institution of maintenance therapy, although results are likely to be seen for progressively shorter periods with each relapse (BIII). 45 Ganciclovir and foscarnet in combination appear to be superior in efficacy to either agent alone and should be considered for patients whose disease does not respond to single-drug therapy, and for patients with multiple relapses of retinitis (CIII) . 45 That drug combination, however, is associated with substantial toxicity. Drug resistance occurs in patients receiving long-term anti-CMV therapy.46-49 Rates of approximately 25% per person-year were reported in the pre-ART era46,50,51 and reported rates are similar for ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir.46,47 In the ART era, the rate of resistance appears to be lower (approximately 5% per person-year).52 Low-level resistance to ganciclovir occurs through mutations in the CMV UL97 (phosphotransferase) gene, and high-level resistance to ganciclovir typically occurs because of mutations in both the CMV UL97 and UL54 (DNA polymerase) genes. 48,53-57 Resistance to foscarnet or cidofovir occurs because of mutations in the CMV UL54 gene. High-level resistance to ganciclovir often is associated with cross resistance to cidofovir 55 and occasionally to foscarnet.56 Although early relapse typically is not a result of resistance, later relapse may be. Because patients with resistant CMV are most likely to have mutations in the CMV UL97 gene, and because a limited number of mutations are responsible for most drug resistance, susceptibility testing in peripheral blood using a CMV DNA PCR assay and sequencing for CMV UL97 mutations or using a point mutation assay 58,59 may be reasonable for patients who relapse on therapy.60 Virus in the eye and in the blood are identical in more than 90% of cases;14 evaluating the blood for resistance is reasonable, and detection of resistance in the blood or urine correlates with clinical behavior of the retinitis in most, but not all, cases. 61 Sequencing the UL97 gene from PCR-amplified specimens from blood can be accomplished in less than 48 hours, correlates well with conventional drug susceptibility testing and clinical outcomes, 60 and therefore has clinical utility for patients in whom therapy has failed. Conventional methods of culture and susceptibility testing and viral sequencing often are not available in clinical laboratories because they are too time-consuming or costly. By themselves, peripheral blood CMV viral load measurements have poor positive predictive value for treatment failure. UL97 mutants usually respond to foscarnet, as do some UL54 mutants. Patients with high-level ganciclovir-resistant isolates will require a switch to alternative therapy. 62 Many clinicians will treat with a series of intravitreal injections of foscarnet and/or systemic foscarnet (CIII) . Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-7Preventing Recurrence When to Start Maintenance Therapy With regard to CMV retinitis, after induction therapy, chronic maintenance therapy should be continued,8,12,19,22,63 until immune reconstitution occurs as a result of ART (AI). Regimens demonstrated to be effective for chronic suppression in randomized, controlled clinical trials include parenteral not protect against contralateral or extraocular disease, however: oral or intravenous therapy must be administered to prevent disease in the contralateral eye until immune reconstitution has occurred. Repetitive intravitreous injections of fomivirsen also have been demonstrated to be effective in randomized clinical trials, but that drug, is no longer available in the United States. The choice of regimen (i.e., which drug(s) and whether given intravitreally, orally or IV) should be made in consultation with an ophthalmologist, and considerations should include the anatomic location of the retinal lesion, vision in the contralateral eye, and a patient's immunologic and virologic status and response to ART. Repetitive intravitreous injections of ganciclovir or of foscarnet have appeared to be effective for maintenance therapy of CMV retinitis in uncontrolled case series. Because of the risk of hypotony and uveitis, and the substantially increased risk of immune recovery uveitis with intravitreal cidofovir, intravitreal administration of cidofovir should be reserved for extraordinary cases. 64 CMV retinitis requires a chronic regimen until an increase in CD4 cell count to >100 cells/mm3 in response to ART has been sustained for 3 to 6 months (AI).65 After resolution of the acute CMV syndrome, and after initiation of effective ART, chronic maintenance therapy is not routinely recommended for CMV gastrointestinal disease, pneumonitis, and central nervous system disease unless there is concurrent retinitis or relapses have occurred (BII). When To Stop Maintenance Therapy Maintenance therapy can be discontinued safely in adults and adolescents with CMV retinitis whose lesions have been treated for at least 3 to 6 months and are inactive and who have had sustained (i.e., 3-6 months) increases in CD4 cell counts to >100 cells/mm 3 in response to ART (AII).4,66-72 Such decisions should be made in consultation with an ophthalmologist. A 3% relapse rate is reported in patients whose anti-CMV therapy has been discontinued for immune recovery, and no level of CD4 cell count is absolutely safe (relapses have been reported at CD4 cell counts of 1250 cells/mm 3). Therefore, in all patients for whom anti-CMV maintenance therapy has been discontinued, ophthalmologic monitoring for early detection of CMV relapse and for IRU should be performed at least every 3 months and periodically after immune reconstitution (AIII) . Monitoring CMV viral load in blood has poor positive predictive value for relapse of retinitis, and therefore is not recommended (BII). Relapse of CMV retinitis occurs frequently in patients whose anti-CMV maintenance therapies have been discontinued and whose CD4 counts have decreased to <50 cells/mm 3.73 Therefore, reinstitution of maintenance therapy should occur when the CD4 count has decreased to <100 cells/mm3 (AIII) . Special Considerations During Pregnancy The diagnostic considerations among pregnant women are the same as for non-pregnant women. Indications for treatment of CMV infection during pregnancy are the same as for nonpregnant HIV-infected adults (AIII) . For retinal disease, use of intravitreous injections for local therapy should be considered in the first trimester, if possible, to limit fetal exposure to systemically administered antiviral drugs (BIII). Systemic antiviral therapy as discussed should then be started after the first trimester. Ganciclovir is embryotoxic among rabbits and mice and teratogenic (i.e., cleft palate, anophthalmia, aplastic kidney and pancreas, and hydrocephalus) in rabbits. 74-76 Safe use in human pregnancy after organ Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-8transplantation has been reported,74,75 and use in late pregnancy to treat fetal CMV infection in non-HIV- infected women has also been reported.77 Foscarnet is associated with an increase in skeletal anomalies or variants in rats and rabbits. No experience with use early in human pregnancy has been reported. A single case report of use in the third trimester described normal infant outcome. 78 Because toxicity of foscarnet is primarily renal, weekly monitoring of amniotic fluid volumes by ultrasound is recommended after 20 weeks of gestation to detect oligohydramnios if foscarnet is used. Cidofovir is embryotoxic and teratogenic (i.e., meningomyelocele and skeletal abnormalities) among rats and rabbits. No experience with use of cidofovir in human pregnancy has been reported; use in pregnancy is not recommended (AIII) . On the basis of limited data, toxicity reports and studies, and ease of use of the various drugs, valganciclovir is recognized as the treatment of choice during pregnancy (BIII). No experience has been reported with the use of valganciclovir in human pregnancy, but concerns are expected to be the same as with ganciclovir. The fetus should be monitored by fetal-movement counting in the third trimester and by periodic ultrasound monitoring after 20 weeks of gestation to look for evidence of hydrops fetalis indicating substantial anemia. No data exist to support use of pooled or CMV-specific intravenous immunoglobulin in this clinical situation. Primary infection, reactivation and reinfection with different CMV strains during pregnancy79 can all lead to in utero transmission and congenital CMV . Although about one-third of newborns acquire congenital CMV infection after primary infection, only approximately 1% to 2% of newborns acquire CMV after a recurrent infection in HIV-uninfected women. Because >90% of HIV-infected pregnant women are CMV antibody positive in the majority of studies, the risk for symptomatic infection in the fetus is expected to be low. 80-84 However, recent studies of HIV-exposed infants suggest that rates of congenital CMV may be increased, ranging from 2% to 7%, 85,86 with higher rates in babies born to mothers with CD4 <200 cells/mm3 and in HIV-infected infants. Maternal ART in pregnancy has been associated with decreased rates of perinatal/early postnatal CMV and occurrence of related clinical symptoms among HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants. 87 Up to 90% of infants who are symptomatic at birth will have serious long-term problems, including hearing loss, visual impairment, mental retardation and/or cognitive impairment, but only 5% to 15% of asymptomatic newborns are at risk for serious long-term impairment. However, asymptomatic congenital CMV infection is associated with late-onset hearing loss in non-HIV-infected children. 88 In women with CMV disease in pregnancy, the fetus should be monitored by periodic ultrasound after 20 weeks gestation, although from studies in HIV-uninfected populations, only about 5% to 25% of infected newborns have ultrasound evidence of congenital infection (e.g., cerebral calcifications, abdominal and liver calcifications, hydrops, microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, ascites, and fetal bowel). Any ultrasound findings suspicious for congenital CMV infection should prompt consideration of invasive testing (i.e., amniocentesis) for definitive diagnosis. Although invasive fetal testing was associated with increased rates of perinatal HIV transmission in early studies, 89 more recent data suggests that risk may be minimal in women on effective ART and with undetectable HIV-RNA levels.89-91 Referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist for evaluation, counseling, and potential further testing is recommended. If fetal CMV infection is confirmed, there is no standard therapy for in utero treatment. A non-randomized trial of CMV hyperimmune globulin suggested potential benefit of passive immunotherapyfor treatment of acute fetal CMV infection, with decreased incidence of having a symptomatic newborn at birth 92 and regression of fetal cerebral abnormalities.93 However, a well-designed, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study with relatively large sample size subsequently found no benefit of CMV hyperimmune globulin in pregnant women.94 A larger placebo-controlled trial of CMV hyperimmune globulin currently is underway at NICHD Maternal Fetal Units across the United States [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01376778]. Routine screening for CMV infection in pregnancy is not recommended in the absence of effective in utero therapy. Treatment of asymptomatic maternal CMV infection during pregnancy solely to prevent infant infection is not indicated (AIII) . Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-9Preventing CMV Disease CMV end-organ disease is best prevented by using ART to maintain CD4 count >100 cells/mm3. Managing CMV Retinitis The choice of initial therapy for CMV retinitis should be individualized, based on location and severity of the lesion(s), the level of immunosuppression, and other factors (e.g., concomitant medications, ability to adhere to treatment) (AIII). Given the evident benefits of systemic therapy in preventing contralateral eye involvement, reduce CMV visceral disease and improve sur vival,whenever feasible, treatment should include systemic therapy. The ganciclovir ocular implant, which is effective for treatment of CMV retinitis, is no longer available. Initial Therapy Followed by Chronic Maintenance Therapy\u2014For Immediate Sight Threatening Lesions (within 1500 microns of the fovea) Preferred Therapy: Intravitreal injections mg/injection) or foscarnet (2.4 mg/injection) for 1-4 doses over a period of 7-10 day s to provide higher intraocular levels of drug and faster control of the infection until steady state intraocular ganciclovir concentrations are achieved (AIII); plus Valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID for 14-21 days, then 900 mg once daily (AI) Alternative Therapy Intravitreal injections as listed above (AIII); plus one of the following systemic therapy: Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12h for 14-21 days, then 5 mg/kg IV daily (AI), or Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12h for 14-21 days, then valganciclovir 900 mg PO daily (AI), or Foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV q8h or 90 mg/kg mg/kg IV q24h (AI), or Cidofovir 5 mg/kg/week IV for 2 weeks, then 5 mg/kg ever y other week with saline hydration before and after therapy and probenecid 2 g PO 3 hours before the dose followed by 1 g PO 2 hours after the dose, and 1 g PO 8 hours after the dose (total of 4 g) (BI). Note: This regimen should be avoided in patients with sulfa allergy because of cross hypersensitivity with probenecid For Peripheral Lesions Administer one of the systemic antiviral therapy listed above for the first 3-6 months until ART induced immune recovery (AII). IRU: Minimizing lesion size by treating all CMV retinitis lesions until there is immune recovery may reduce the incidence of IRU (BII). IRU might develop in the setting of immune reconstitution. Treatment of IRU: Periocular corticosteroid or a short course of systemic steroid (BIII). Stopping Chronic Maintenance Therapy for CMV Retinitis: CMV treatment for at least 3-6 months, and lesions are inactive, and with CD4 count >100 cells/mm3 for 3 to 6 months in response to ART (AII). Therapy should be discontinued only after consultation with an ophthalmologist, taking into account magnitude and duration of CD4 count increase, anatomic location of the lesions, vision in the contralateral eye, and the feasibility of regular ophthalm ologic monitoring. Routine (i.e., ever y 3 months) ophthalmologic follow-up is recommended after stopping chronic maintenance therapy for early detection of relapse or IRU, and then periodically after sustained immune reconstitution (AIII). Reinstituting Chronic Maintenance for cells/mm3 (AIII).Recommendations for Treating Cytomegalovirus Infections (page 1 of 2) Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV K-10Managing CMV Esophagitis or Colitis Doses are the same as CMV retinitis. Preferred Therapy: Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12h, may switch to valganciclovir 900 mg PO q12h once the patient can absorb and tolerate PO therapy (BI) . Alternative Therapy: Foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV q8h or (BIII)\u2014for patients treatment limiting toxicities to ganciclovir or with ganciclovir resistance; or Oral valganciclovir may be used if symptoms are not severe enough to interfere with oral absorption (BIII); or For mild cases: If ART can be initiated or optimized without delay, withholding CMV therapy may be considered (CIII). Duration of Anti-CMV Therapy: 21-42 days or until signs and symptoms have resolved (CII). Note: Maintenance therapy is usually not necessary, but should be considered after relapses (BII) Managing Well-Documented CMV Pneumonitis: Doses are the same as for CMV retinitis. Treatment experience for CMV pneumonitis in HIV patients is limited. Use of IV ganciclovir or IV foscarnet is reasonable (CIII). The role of oral valganciclovir has not been established. The optimal duration of therapy has not been established. Managing CMV Neurological Disease Doses are the same as for CMV retinitis. Treatment should be initiated promptly. Combination of ganciclovir IV plus foscarnet IV to stabilize disease and maximize response (CIII). Optimal duration of therapy has not been established. The role of oral valganciclovir has not been established. Optimize ART to achieve viral suppression and immune reconstitution (BIII).Recommendations for Treating Cytomegalovirus Infections (page 2 of 2) Key to Acronyms: ART = antiretroviral therapy; BID = twice a day; CMV = Cytomegalovirus; IRU = immune recovery uveitis; PO = orally; IV = intraveneously; q(n)h = every \"n\" hours References 1.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-1Hepatitis B Virus Infection (Last updated November 13, 2018; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide.1-5 Globally and in North America, approximately 10% of patients with HIV infection have evidence of chronic HBV infection.6-8 In countries with a low prevalence of endemic chronic HBV infection, the virus is transmitted primarily through sexual contact and injection drug use, whereas perinatal and early childhood exposures are responsible for most HBV transmission in higher prevalence regions. 9 Although the general modes of transmission are similar to those for HIV , HBV is transmitted more efficiently than HIV .1,2 The risk of progression to chronic HBV infection varies with age and is 90% among those infected before 1 year of age, 25 to 50% among those infected at 1 to 5 years of age, and <5% among those infected as adults. 9,10 Persons with HIV infection are at increased risk for developing chronic HBV infection.11 Genotypes of HBV (A-J) have been identified, and their geographic distributions differ.12 Genotype A is most common among patients in North America and Western Europe and genotypes B and C among patients from Asia.13 Clinical Manifestations Acute HBV infection is asymptomatic in approximately 70% of patients, and <1% of patients develop fulminant hepatic failure. 3,14 When symptoms manifest, they may include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and arthralgias with or without jaundice. HBV has an average incubation period of 90 days (range 60-150 days) from exposure to onset of jaundice and 60 days (range 40-90 days) from exposure to onset of abnormal liver enzymes. Most patients with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue. Between 15% to 40% of people with chronic HBV infection will develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or liver failure, and up to 25% of people will die prematurely from complications of chronic HBV infection. 15 Diagnosis The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommend testing patients with HIV infection for chronic HBV . 9,16,17 Initial testing should include serologic testing for surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) (AI). In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1-9 weeks) after exposure and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on 2 occasions at least 6 months apart. 9 Patients with chronic HBV infection should be further tested for HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe), and HBV DNA. Active disease, which can be HBeAg-negative or HBeAg-positive, can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations. 3 Patients whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg-negative with positive anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc, although covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) may remain in hepatocyte nuclei. 3,18 With cccDNA in hepatocyte nuclei, a patient with severe immune suppression, such as seen with rituximab therapy or after stem cell transplant, may become serum HBsAg-positive again with HBV viremia. 19,20 The presence of an isolated anti-HBc test result usually signifies infection with HBV in the past with subsequent loss of anti-HBs and occurs in 7% to 19% of patients with HIV infection. 21-25 Incidence of HBV viremia in patients with HIV infection and isolated anti-HBc ranges from 1% to 36%.21,23,26-28 The clinical Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-2significance of isolated anti-HBc is unknown21,25,28-30 but in individuals with HIV infection, it may indicate chronic or, more likely, resolved HBV infection.24,31,32 In a low-prevalence country such as the United States, isolated anti-HBc may also represent a false-positive result.24,31,33,34 Patients with HIV infection have a higher frequency of isolated anti-HBc, particularly those with underlying HCV coinfection.24,35,36 Diagnosing HBV Disease Progression and the Role of Assessment of Liver Fibrosis Compared with individuals with HBV monoinfection, those with HIV/HBV coinfection have higher levels of HBV viremia and lower likelihood of resolved infection following acute HBV infection.37 In individuals with (to anti-HBe-seronegativity), HBsAg loss, and acquisition of anti-HBs are all associated with a decreased incidence of cirrhosis, HCC, 38- 40 and improved survival.41-44 In comparison, persons with HIV/HBV coinfection are usually more likely to have detectable HBeAg,37,45 lower rates of seroconversion to anti- HBe, and increased risk of HCC and liver- related mortality and morbidity.46,47 Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic disease with a number of phases that are associated with either active or inactive chronic hepatitis, and include: the immune tolerant phase (normal ALT [upper limits of normal 19-25 U/L for women and 29-44 U/L for men], HBeAg-positive, high HBV DNA), the immune active phase (HBeAg-positive or negative, detectable HBV DNA, elevated ALT), and the inactive hepatitis B phase (HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe positive, low or undetectable HBV DNA, normal ALT). 15 Duration of disease phases is different in those who acquire infection as neonates and young children than in those who acquire infection as adults. The immune tolerant phase occurs primarily after perinatal infection. Clinicians should be knowledgeable about these phases in patients with HBV monoinfection to determine who needs treatment and who should be monitored (see AASLD guidelines 2018 https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.29800 ). In HIV/HBV coinfection, monitoring and treatment are also focused on the simultaneous treatment of both viruses. Persons with anti-HBe seroconversion and HBeAg loss usually transition into the inactive hepatitis B phase. 15 This transition can be spontaneous or associated with effective HBV treatment. In some instances, increased levels of ALT may precede a decline in HBV DNA that is accompanied by anti-HBe seroconversion, that is, loss of HBeAg and development of anti-HBe. 48 However, such spontaneous HBeAg conversion rates appear to be lower in patients with HIV/HBV coinfection than in patients with HBV monoinfection. The inactive chronic HBV state is characterized by a negative HBeAg, normal ALT levels, and an HBV DNA level <2,000 IU/mL. 48 Patients in the inactive state remain at risk of reactivation of HBV and development of HCC, but the risk is lower than for individuals with active HBV replication. In any patient, the re-emergence of abnormal liver enzyme tests may reflect HBeAg-negative chronic HBV disease, a result of mutations in the basal core and precore promoter regions. 15 Although levels of HBV DNA are usually lower, patients who are HBeAg-negative experience an unrelenting but fluctuating course of disease progression, with fluctuating HBV DNA levels. 17 Patients in the inactive phase still require HBeAg, ALT, and HBV DNA monitoring. Persistent low-level serum ALT abnormalities may be associated with significant liver disease, although normal ALT levels also may be seen in the setting of cirrhosis. 17 When chronic HBV infection is diagnosed, patients should be linked to care and have a complete history and physical examination for signs of cirrhosis or HCC. In addition, patients should have a complete blood count, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, HBeAg/anti-HBe, HBV DNA, anti-HA V to determine need for vaccination, abdominal ultrasound, and liver fibrosis assessment at initial visit, and be monitored every 6 to 12 months. 3 Patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of HCC; therefore, HCC surveillance every 6 months is required for patients who are cirrhotic, and for individuals in the following groups who are at increased risk of disease progression: Asian males older than age 40; Asian females older than age 50; and males older than age 20 who are from sub-Saharan Africa. 49 Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection are at increased risk of HCC,50 and some experts screen patients with HIV/HBV coinfection over 40 years of age for HCC. Assessment of the patient's liver fibrosis stage is important. There is increasing evidence that noninvasive methods (i.e., elastography and serum markers) to evaluate liver fibrosis can be used to determine fibrosis in HBV Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-3infection.51 The decision to perform a liver biopsy should be individualized and is rarely necessary.3 Preventing Exposure HBV is primarily transmitted through percutaneous or mucosal exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Therefore, patients with HIV infection should be counseled about transmission risks for HBV and encouraged to avoid behaviors associated with such transmission (AIII) . Such counseling should emphasize sexual transmission and the risks associated with sharing needles and syringes, unregulated tattooing, or body-piercing. Preventing Disease All family members and sexual contacts of patients with HBV infection should be tested, and all susceptible contacts should receive HBV vaccines regardless of whether they have HIV infection (AII). Hepatitis B vaccination is the most effective way to prevent HBV infection and its consequences. All patients with HIV infection who are susceptible to HBV infection should receive hepatitis B vaccination with one of the available vaccines (see below) (AII) or with the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (AII). All patients with HIV infection should be screened for hepatitis B, and screening should include HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc. 9,16,17 A patient who is seropositive for anti-HBc and anti-HBs has resolved infection and does not need vaccination. Similarly, the presence of anti-HBs alone at levels 10 mIU/mL, after completion of the vaccine series, is consistent with seroprotection, 52 and no further vaccinations are required.53 The interpretation is less clear in individuals with the isolated anti-HBc pattern (HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive, anti-HBs negative). Aside from false-positive results, this pattern may signify infection in the distant past with subsequent loss of anti-HBs. 54 Most patients with HIV infection with isolated anti-HBc are HBV DNA-negative and not immune to HBV infection;36 therefore, routinely checking HBV DNA is not recommended. However, such patients should be vaccinated with one standard dose of HBV vaccine and anti-HBs titers should be checked 1 to 2 months after vaccination. If the anti-HBs titer is >100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if the titer is <100 mIU/mL, a complete series of HBV vaccine should be completed followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). 55 The cut-off of 100 mIU/mL is used in this situation because one study demonstrated that 100% of patients with isolated anti-HBc who achieved a titer of 100 mIU/mL after a booster dose maintained an anti-HBs response for >18 months as compared to only 23% of those who achieved a titer of 10 to 100 mIU/mL. 55 Available adult single-antigen hepatitis B vaccines include two recombinant HBsAg vaccines (Engerix-B and Recombivax-HB) and a recombinant to a cytosine phosphoguanine oligonucleotide (CpG a toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist (Heplisav-B). The magnitude and duration of immunogenicity to hepatitis B vaccination with the recombinant vaccines in adults with HIV infection is significantly lower than in healthy adults who are HIV seronegative. 53,56-58 Factors associated with poor response to vaccine include low CD4 cell counts,56,59-64 presence of detectable HIV RNA,60,64,65 coinfection with HCV , occult HBV infection, and the general health status of the host.23,36,66- 70 Based on these data, early vaccination is recommended in patients with HIV infection before CD4 cell counts decline to <350 cells/mm3 (AII). However, in patients who present to care with a lower CD4 cell count, vaccination should not be deferred until CD4 counts increase to >350 cells/mm3 because some patients with HIV infection with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 do respond to vaccination (AII). Among persons with HIV infection who did not respond (anti-HBs titers <10 mIU/mL) to a primary 3-dose vaccine series with a recombinant vaccine, 25% to 50% responded to an additional vaccine dose, and 44% to 100% responded to a 3-dose revaccination series. 71-74 As a result, persons with HIV infection who do not respond to a complete hepatitis B vaccination series with one of the recombinant vaccines should receive a 3-dose revaccination series (BIII), 53 although some specialists might delay revaccination until antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in a sustained increase in CD4 cell count (CIII) . Two randomised controlled trials have shown that using 4 doses of double-dose of the recombinant vaccine produces higher anti-HBs titers than 3 doses of standard-dose vaccine, 75,76 and one study also showed a higher overall response rate.76 Some specialists consider that Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-4this approach\u20144 vaccinations\u2014improves immunologic response in individuals with HIV infection either as an initial vaccination schedule or in patients who are non-responders (BI). However, whether a schedule of 4 double-dose vaccines is superior to 4 single-dose or 3 double-dose vaccines is still unclear. Another study suggested that patients with HIV infection with CD4 counts >350 cells/mm 3 had improved responses when vaccinated with a double-dose recombinant vaccine on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule.59 Although other approaches have been investigated to improve responses, such as the use of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine 77,78 data are insufficient to support a broad recommendation for these approaches at this time. In four randomized-controlled trials, Heplisav-B was superior to 3 doses of Engerix-B in HIV-negative individuals.79-81 In the largest trial, the protection rate was 95% for Heplisav-B and 81% for Engerix-B.81 There was an increase in the number of cardiovascular events in the Heplisav-B group that was not statistically significant. The safety and efficacy of Heplisav-B in individuals with HIV infection has not been studied. If a two-dose vaccine is preferred, Heplisav-B is an option (CIII) . If Hepislav-B is used, the vaccine should not be interchanged with either of the other recombinant vaccines for the second dose. If the previously administered vaccine is unknown, then the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices provides recommendations , which state that the two-dose vaccine series only applies when both doses are Hepsliav-B. In other situations, three total doses of vaccine should be given. Preventing Other Liver Diseases HA V vaccination is recommended for all patients who are HA V antibody-negative and have chronic liver disease 3; for patients who are injection and non-injection drug users; and for men who have sex with men (AIII) . Responses to the HA V vaccine are reduced in patients with HIV infection with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3.82,83 Antibody response should be assessed 1 month after vaccination is complete. If HA V antibody immunoglobulin (HA V Ab IgG) is negative, patients should be revaccinated when the CD4 cell count is >200 cells/mm 3 (BIII). Patients with chronic HBV disease should be advised to avoid alcohol consumption (AIII) . Treating Disease The ultimate treatment goals in HIV/HBV coinfection are the same as for HBV monoinfection: to prevent disease progression and to reduce HBV-related morbidity and mortality. Patients with HIV/HBV (TAF)-based ART. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART Preferred Regimen The Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents Living with HIV recommend the fixed-dose coformulations of TDF count.84 Because both tenofovir and emtricitabine have anti-HBV activity, the tenofovir combinations are also the treatment of choice for patients with HIV/HBV coinfection (AIII) regardless of CD4 count level (AIII) . (See HBV/HIV Coinfection in the Adult and Adolescents Guidelnes.) TDF and TAF are both active against wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV strains. Studies in patients with HIV/HBV coinfection (most of them carrying lamivudine-resistant HBV) have shown, on average, 4 log 10 declines in HBV DNA levels.85-90 TDF and TAF have a high genetic barrier for development of resistance mutations (AI).3,91 The decision to use TAF/emtricitabine versus TDF/emtricitabine should be based upon creatinine clearance (CrCl) and an assessment of risk for nephrotoxicity and for acceleration of bone loss. In patients with CrCl 60 mL/min, either TAF/emtricitabine or TDF/emtricitabine can be considered. In patients with a CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min, a TAF/emtricitabine regimen is preferred. Currently approved TAF/emtricitabine-containing regimens for the treatment of HIV infection are not recommended for use in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-5so for these patients renally dosed entecavir with ART is recommended (BIII). Renally- dosed TDF can also be used if recovery of renal function is unlikely (BIII). If renally-dosed TDF is used, then the CrCl needs to be monitored carefully. In patients with HIV/HBV coinfection, switching from a primarily TDF-based ART regimen to single tablet TAF/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat maintained or achieved HBV suppression, with improved estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and bone turnover markers. 92 In patients with HBV monoinfection, TAF 25 mg was non-inferior to TDF 300 mg based on the percentage of patients with HBV DNA levels <29 IU/mL at 48 weeks of therapy (94% for TAF vs. 93% for TDF; P = 0.47). Patients on TAF also experienced significantly smaller mean percentage decreases from baseline in hip and spine bone mineral density at 48 weeks than patients receiving TDF (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the median change in eGFR from baseline to 48 weeks also favored TAF (P = 0.004). 93,94 Chronic administration of lamivudine or emtricitabine as the only active drug against HBV should be avoided because of the high rate of selection of HBV drug-resistance mutations (AI). Patients receiving ART should continue HBV therapy indefinitely (CIII) because relapses after response occur, particularly in those with lower CD4 cell counts. 3 Additionally, discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy is associated with a HBV flare in approximately 30% of cases,95,96 with loss of the benefit accrued from previous anti-HBV treatment and possible decompensation of liver disease.56,97-99 If anti-HBV therapy and ART must be discontinued, transaminase levels should be monitored every 6 weeks for 3 months and every 3 to 6 months thereafter. If a flare occurs, anti-HBV therapy and ART should be reinstituted and can be potentially lifesaving (AIII) . Alternative Treatment of HBV in Patients with HIV Infection Who Are Not Receiving ART HBV and HIV co-treatment is essential and recommended.84 There are few options that can be used for treatment of HBV alone in the patient with HIV/HBV coinfection. Directly acting HBV drugs must not be given in the absence of a fully suppressive ART regimen (AII). Only pegylated interferon-alfa-2a monotherapy may be considered for patients with HIV/HBV coinfection who are not receiving ART and who meet criteria for HBV therapy as described in the AASLD 2018 guidelines (CIII) . 100 Some patients with HIV/HBV coinfection also have chronic HCV infection. There is scant information on the treatment of HBV/HCV/HIV coinfection. Because patients with HBV , HCV , and HIV appear to have accelerated progression of liver fibrosis, higher risk of HCC, and increased mortality, 101-103 attempts should be made to treat both hepatitis viruses, if feasible. If ART is administered, then anti-HBV therapy must be included as part of the regimen (as above) and anti-HCV therapy can be introduced as needed (see Hepatitis C Infection ) (CIII) . As HBV reactivation can occur during treatment for HCV with directly active agents (DAAs) in the absence of HBV-active drugs, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection who will be treated for HCV should be on HBV-active ART at the time of HCV treatment initiation (AIII) . 104-107 Regimens entecavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, and telbivudine should not be used alone in the absence of a fully suppressive ART regimen because of the development of HIV-resistance mutations (AI). 108,109 Other HBV treatment regimens include adefovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine or telbivudine in addition to a fully suppressive ART regimen;90,110,111 however, data on these regimens in persons with HIV/HBV coinfection are limited. In addition, compared to TDF or TAF or entecavir, these regimens are associated with higher incidence of toxicity, including renal disease with adefovir and myopathy and neuropathy with telbivudine, as well as higher rates of HBV treatment failure. Therefore, the Panel on Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV (the Panel) does not recommend these drugs/regimens for patients with HIV/HBV coinfection (AI). Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) To prevent emergence of drug-resistant variants and evaluate response for patients on nucleos(t)ide analogues, treatment response should be monitored by testing for HBV DNA at 3 to 6 month intervals (AI). Treatment Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-6responses are defined as follows: Primary non-response is an HBV DNA <1 log10 decline at 12 weeks.112 A complete virologic response is an undetectable HBV DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction at 24 to 48 weeks.112 A partial virologic response is 1 log 10 decline but still detectable HBV DNA at 24 weeks.112 A maintained virologic response is a response that continues while on therapy, and a sustained virologic response is one that is still present 6 months after stopping therapy.112 For patients who are HBeAg-positive, loss of HBeAg is also a measure of virologic response. Other markers that indicate treatment success include improvement in liver histology based on biopsy, transient elastography or noninvasive markers, normalization of serum aminotransferases, and, in those with loss of HBeAg, the development of anti-HBe. Sustained loss of HBsAg is considered by some to be a complete response; however, this desirable serologic response is uncommon (<1% of HBsAg-positive patients per year). 3 Adverse Events Renal toxicity with TDF, including increased serum creatinine or renal tubular dysfunction, has been observed; both are more frequent in patients with HIV infection who have underlying renal insufficiency, are older, or have been treated with TDF for prolonged periods. 113 These biochemical changes are usually reversible when TDF is discontinued or changed to TAF.114 Electrolytes and serum creatinine levels should be evaluated at baseline and every 3 to 6 months, and urinalysis every 6 months. Because renal toxicity may be reversible, alternative anti-HBV therapy should be used if renal toxicity occurs (AI). If TDF is used in patients with baseline renal insufficiency, either a dose adjustment as noted in the package insert or a change to TAF with appropriate dose adjustment is required. 114 All nucleos(t) ides must be dose adjusted for renal dysfunction (see package insert) and TAF is not recommended in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min (AI). Entecavir-associated lactic acidosis is uncommon but has been reported in patients with HBV monoinfection with advanced cirrhosis. 115 Major toxicities of IFN-alfa (pegylated or standard) are flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, and headache, and psychiatric reactions including depression, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety. Other common reactions are anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) Return of immune competence after ART (or after steroid withdrawal or chemotherapy) can lead to reactivation of HBV-associated liver disease. Any immune reconstitution can lead to a rise in serum aminotransferases, so called \"hepatitis flare,\" 116 which constitutes IRIS in persons with HIV/HBV coinfection. IRIS may manifest when serum aminotransferase levels dramatically increase as CD4 cell counts rise within the first 6 to 12 weeks after ART is started, with signs and symptoms characteristic of acute hepatitis and without another cause for the flare. 117,118 After introduction of ART, serum ALT levels should be monitored closely; some experts recommend ALT testing at 6 and 12 weeks, then every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Any association between abnormal aminotransferases and clinical jaundice or synthetic dysfunction (elevated INR and low serum albumin) should prompt consultation with a hepatologist (CI). 114 Flares are worse in patients with more severe liver disease, especially in those with cirrhosis.119 Distinguishing between drug-induced liver injury or other causes of hepatitis (acute hepatitis with A, C, D, or E virus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus) and IRIS may be difficult. ART-associated hepatotoxicity may be dose-dependent or idiosyncratic. In individuals with HIV , the risk of ART-associated hepatotoxicity has been consistently associated with elevated pre-ART aminotransferases (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase) and the presence of HBV HCV coinfection before initiation of ART. In HIV/HBV coinfection, baseline elevated Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-7HBV DNA levels are predictive of hepatotoxicity.120-123 However, despite this increased risk of hepatotoxicity in the setting of HCV or HBV coinfection, most (80% to not have ART-associated hepatotoxicity,124 and clinically (elevated direct bilirubin and INR) is rare; aminotransferase levels return to baseline in most cases, even if the offending medication is continued. 125,126 Therefore, discontinuing ART usually is not necessary in the presence of hepatotoxicity unless patients have symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, rash), symptomatic hepatitis (i.e., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or jaundice), or elevations in serum aminotransferase levels >10 times the upper limit of normal. However, the development of jaundice is associated with severe morbidity and mortality, and the offending drug(s) should be discontinued (AIII) . 127 The major problem in managing ALT flares is distinguishing between drug-induced liver injury and HBV reactivation, IRIS, emergence of HBV drug resistance, and HBeAg seroconversion. In drug-induced liver injury, determining the offending medication also can be challenging. A review of the medication history and testing for serum HBV DNA, HBeAg, HIV RNA levels, and CD4 cell count can help distinguish between these possibilities. Liver histology also may help to differentiate drug toxicity (e.g., increased eosinophils) from viral hepatitis (e.g., portal inflammation). If the flare is severe or HBV drug resistance is suspected, then consultation with a hepatologist is recommended. Other causes of abnormal liver tests should be considered, including use of drugs or alcohol, other viral hepatitis infections (hepatitis A, C, D, and E), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Managing Treatment Failure HBV treatment failure on nucleos(t)ide analogues is defined as primary nonresponse (HBV DNA <1 log 10 decline) after 12 weeks of therapy in patients who consistently adhere to HBV therapy or as an increase in HBV DNA levels >1 log 10 above nadir. In either situation, treatment failure is generally due either to drug- resistant HBV if the patient is on lamivudine/emtricitabine monotherapy or to non-adherence to therapy.3 If drug-resistant HBV is present, a change in treatment is needed (AII). Distinct resistance patterns exist with the different groups of anti-HBV shares some resistance mutations with the L-nucleosides. Many experts will obtain HBV-resistance testing because it has value in distinguishing between non-adherence and drug resistance, evaluating patients with unclear prior drug history, assessing different adefovir-resistance pathways, and predicting the level of resistance to entecavir. 128 However, TDF has not been associated with clinical resistance, although slow response has been noted as discussed above. Addition of entecavir has led to suppression of HBV DNA in patients whose response to TDF is slow. 129 Lamivudine (or emtricitabine) monotherapy for HBV leads to emergence of drug-resistant HBV , which increases with time on treatment; therefore, should not be used as the sole anti-HBV drug in an ART regimen (AII). The rate of development of lamivudine-resistance is approximately 20% per year in patients with HIV/HBV coinfection treated with lamivudine alone. 130 If lamivudine resistance is suspected or documented, TDF or TAF should be added to the ART regimen (BIII).131-133 Because patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV will have cross-resistance to the other L-nucleosides (telbivudine, emtricitabine), and partial resistance to entecavir, those agents should not be used in patients found to have lamivudine- resistant HBV (AI). 134 All nucleoside analogs must be dose adjusted for renal insufficiency per package insert guidelines and Table 8. If treatment failure occurs on entecavir, then the only rational choice is replacement with TDF or TAF (with or without emtricitabine) because of the cross resistance that occurs with L-nucleosides (telbivudine, lamivudine, emtricitabine) (AI). Patients whose HBV initially fails to respond to pegylated IFN-alfa can be given nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy following the recommendations previously described (CIII) . If treatment failure with TDF or TAF occurs, particularly in lamivudine- or emtricitabine-experienced patients, then entecavir may be an active alternative, especially if higher doses of entecavir can be used (CIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-8However, documented in vivo resistance to tenofovir has not yet been reported. Declines in HBV DNA levels can be slow, especially when pretherapy HBV DNA levels are very high. HBV DNA levels usually drop quickly in patients who are receiving an HBV drug with high potency and a high genetic barrier to resistance, such as tenofovir, but HBV DNA levels may still be detectable for some years. 3 Thus, in a patient who is adherent to therapy with a partial virologic response to tenofovir, the drug should be continued with monitoring of HBV DNA levels (BII). Improved virologic response has been reported with the addition of entecavir to TDF; however, whether such \"intensification therapy\" is required is unclear. 129 Nonetheless, patients on drugs that are less potent or that have a lower barrier to resistance, such as adefovir or L-nucleosides, who have partial virologic responses (<2 log 10 drop in HBV DNA levels from baseline at 24 weeks) should be switched to a more potent regimen such as tenofovir (TDF or TAF) with emtricitabine or entecavir (if on adefovir) because of the risk of development of drug resistance to the initial therapy (BII). Special Considerations for Treating End-Stage Liver Disease Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection who have end-stage liver disease should be managed as an HBV monoinfected patient with end-stage liver disease including referral to a hepatologist (CI). In patients with HIV/HBV coinfection in end-stage liver disease, interferon-alfa is contraindicated (AI), but nucleoside analogs are safe and efficacious (AI). 130,135,136 All patients with ascites should undergo paracentesis to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).137,138 Management of ascites includes sodium restriction (<2 g/day) and the recommended diuretic regimen is spironolactone combined with furosemide (ratio of 40 mg furosemide: 100 mg spironolactone) (AI). All patients who have had SBP and those with ascites total protein <1 g/dL should receive prophylaxis against SBP with administration of oral antibiotics such as norfloxacin (400 mg/day), ciprofloxacin (750 Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD or upper endoscopy) should be performed on all patients with cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis and then every 1 to 2 years to identify substantial gastroesophageal varices (see AASLD guidelines ). Patients with beta blockers, such as nadolol or propranolol, that are the mainstay of both primary and secondary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. Esophageal variceal banding is another preventive option, particularly for those who cannot tolerate beta blockers. Hepatic encephalopathy is treated with a 40-g protein diet and the use of non-absorbable disaccharides such as lactulose and/or non-absorbable antibiotics such as rifaximin. 3 Patients with HBV-related cirrhosis are at increased risk of HCC140 and should have imaging studied performed every 6 to 12 months, as recommended in HBV monoinfection (AI). 3 Choice of imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) depends upon the expertise of the imaging center and whether the patient has cirrhosis. Usually ultrasound is the initial preferred imaging modality. 3 HCC can occur without cirrhosis in HBV infection, and HIV/HBV coinfection appears to increase the risk of HBV-associated HCC, 141 but more frequent surveillance in HIV/HBV coinfection has not been studied, and so cannot be recommended given insufficient evidence. Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection with decompensated liver disease and/or early HCC are candidates for liver transplantation. HIV infection is not a contraindication to organ transplantation in patients on suppressive ART. 142 Because transplantation does not cure HBV infection, post-transplant hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and HBV treatment is required (AII). Preventing Recurrence As previously indicated, most patients should continue HBV therapy (with the exception of pegylated IFN) indefinitely (CIII) because relapses after response occur, particularly in those with lower CD4 cell counts, and because reports of hepatitis flares after discontinuation of 3TC in those who have not reached treatment endpoints can be extrapolated to other HBV-active drugs. 97-99 Special Considerations During Immunosuppressive Therapy As patients with HIV infection live longer, treatment of individuals with HIV infection with immunosuppressive therapy, both in the context of malignancy and rheumatologic/autoimmune diseases is Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-9becoming common. HBV reactivation in HIV-negative patients with HBsAg-positive/anti-HBc positive disease receiving immunomodulatory therapy is well described.143,144 Even in patients with HBsAg-negative/ anti-HBc positive disease, HBV reactivation occurs in occurs in 8% to 18% and 1.7% of patients receiving anti-cancer 145 and rheumatologic disease drugs,146 respectively. If not already performed, individuals with HIV infection undergoing immunosuppressive therapy should have HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs testing. Individuals who are HBsAg positive should receive treatment as detailed in Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART. The optimal approach for those patients with HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc positive disease is unknown. However, since tenofovir/emtricitabine is a preferred backbone for ART, it is prudent to start or modify ART to include these drugs before initiating immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, or immunomodulatory therapy in patients with HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc positive disease (BIII). If tenofovir/emtricitabine cannot be used as part of their HIV regimen, these patients could either receive entecavir for anti-HBV prophylaxis or be monitored and given entecavir if signs of HBV reactivation occur (increase in HBV DNA or HBsAg seroreversion) (BIII). The option to give pre-emptive entecavir prophylaxis is preferred if HBV DNA is detectable or if immunosuppression is more severe, such as with anti-CD20 antibodies (AII). 147 There are no studies on the appropriate length of therapy but the Panel agrees with the AASLD 2018 guidance recommendation to continue treatment for 6 months after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy and for 12 months in the setting of anti-CD20 antibodies (BIII). 100 Special Considerations During Pregnancy Pregnant women with HIV infection should be screened for HBsAg, and co-infection with HBV may be first diagnosed at this time. (AI). 148 Those who are both HBsAg and anti-HBs-negative should be offered vaccination against HBV . Treatment of symptomatic acute HBV infection during pregnancy should be supportive, with special attention given to maintaining blood glucose levels and normal clotting status. Risk of pre-term labor and delivery may increase with acute HBV infection. High maternal HBV DNA levels correlate strongly with HBV of immunoprophylaxis. 149-152 See HIV/ Hepatitis B Virus Coinfection in the Recommendations for the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant Women with HIV Infection and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States. ART including drugs active against both HIV and HBV is recommended for all individuals with HIV/HBV coinfection, including pregnant women (AIII) . TDF given in combination with 3TC or FTC is the preferred dual-NRTI backbone for pregnant women with chronic HBV infection (AIII) .153 There are no data on use of TAF in pregnancy, therefore it is not recommended.154 Once HBV therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs and ART is initiated in patients with HIV/HBV coinfection, treatment should be continued indefinitely. Cases of adverse events during pregnancy to any of the ARV or HBV drugs listed should be reported to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (800-258-4263). As of January 2018, 5,008 cases of pregnancy outcomes after first-trimester exposures to lamivudine have been reported to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, with no indication of an increased risk of birth defects after exposure ( http://www.apregistry.com/forms/ interim_report.pdf ). Lamivudine has been well tolerated by pregnant women and is a recommended NRTI for use in pregnancy (AII). 153 Similarly, no increase in birth defects has been noted in 2,785 cases of first-trimester exposure to emtricitabine. Emtricitabine is a recommended NRTI and is commonly used in pregnancy (BII). 155 A total of 3,535 cases of first-trimester exposure to tenofovir have been reported to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry with no increase in birth defects noted. In a large HIV prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) trial examining different antenatal ART regimens, TDF/emtricitabine + lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with a higher infant mortality rate at 14 days than zidovudine/lamivudine + lopinavir/ritonavir, 4.4% vs. 0.06% respectively. The mechanisms for this finding are unclear. 156 Other studies of tenofovir use in pregnancy have not suggested increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.157 Several other ART agents with activity against HBV , including adefovir and telbivudine, have been evaluated and found not to be teratogenic in animals, but experience with these agents in the first trimester of human pregnancy is limited. These drugs could be included in a regimen during pregnancy if other options are inappropriate. Each of these agents should be administered only in combination with a fully suppressive ART regimen because Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV L-10of the risk of development of ART drug resistance. Entecavir was associated with skeletal anomalies in rats and rabbits, but only at high, maternally-toxic doses (package insert). Data on use of entecavir and adefovir in human pregnancy are not available. Telbivudine given to women who were HBV-seropositive, HIV-seronegative during the second and third trimester was well-tolerated with no birth defects observed. 158 IFN-alfa formulations are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Although these agents are not teratogenic, they are abortifacient at high doses in monkeys and should not be used in pregnant women because of their direct antigrowth and antiproliferative effects (AII). 159 Infants born to women who are HBsAg-positive should receive hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of delivery (AI). The second and third doses of vaccine should be administered at 1 and 6 months of age, respectively (AI). For infants who weigh <2000g at birth, the birth dose should not be counted toward the 3 dose series. Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection (page 1 of 2) Preventing HBV Infection Indications for HBV Vaccination: Patients without chronic HBV infection and without immunity to HBV (anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL) (AII) Patients with isolated anti-HBc (BII). Recommend one standard dose of HBV vaccine followed by anti-HBs at 1-2 months. If the titer is >100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if the titer is <100 mIU/mL, a complete series of HBV vaccine should be completed followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). Early vaccination is recommended before CD4 count falls below 350 cells/mm3 (AII), as low CD4 count at time of vaccination has been associated with poor response to the vaccine. However , in a patient with low baseline CD4 cell count, vaccination should not be deferred until CD4 reaches >350 cells/mm3, as some patients with CD4 <200 cells/mm3 do respond to vaccination (AII). Vaccination IM (Engerix-B\u00ae 20 mcg/mL or Recombivax HB\u00ae 10 mcg/mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months (AII); or HBV vaccine IM (Engerix-B\u00ae 40 mcg/mL or Recombivax HB\u00ae 20 mcg/mL) at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months (BI); or Combined HA V and HBV vaccine (Twinrix\u00ae) 1 mL IM as a 3-dose series (at 0, 1, and 6 months) or as a 4-dose series (at days 0, 7, 21 to 30, and 12 months) (AII); or V accine conjugated to CpG (Heplisav-B\u00ae) IM at 0 and 1 months (CIII) - a 2-dose series can only be used when both doses given are Heplisav-B\u00ae. Anti-HBs should be obtained 1 to 2 months after completion of the vaccine series. Patients with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL will be considered as vaccine non-responders (BIII). For Vaccine Non-Responders: Revaccinate with a second vaccine series (BIII). For patients with low CD4 count at the time of first vaccination series, some experts might delay revaccination until after a sustained increase in CD4 count with AR T (CIII). Alternative Vaccine Dose and Duration for Vaccine Non-Responders: Double dose, 4-dose series - HBV vaccine IM (Engerix-B\u00ae 40 mcg/mL or Recombivax HB\u00ae 20 mcg/mL at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months (BI) . Treating HBV Infection Indication for Therapy: All patients with HIV/HBV coinfection, regardless of CD4 count and HBV DNA level (AII). Therapy should be selected to treat both HIV and HBV infections (AIII). Preferred Therapy (CrCl 60 mL/min): The AR T regimen must include 2 drugs active against HBV, preferably with [TDF 300 mg + (FTC 200 mg or 3TC 300 mg)] or [TAF (10 or 25 mg)a + FTC 200 mg] PO once daily (AIII). Preferred Therapy (CrCl 30-59 mL/min) The AR T regimen must include 2 drugs active against HBV, preferably with TAF (10 or 25 mg)a + FTC 200 mg PO once daily (AIII).

Estimations of worldwide prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a systematic review of data published between 1965 and 2013. Lancet. 2015;386(10003):1546-1555. Preferred Therapy (CrCl <30 mL/min) A fully suppressive AR T regimen without tenofovir should be used, with the addition of renally dosed entecavir to the regimen or AR T with renally dose-adjusted TDF and FTC can be used (BIII) when recovery of renal function is unlikely (see Table 7 for dosing recommendation for TDF and FTC or 3TC for patients with renal impairment). Guidance for TAF use in persons with CrCl <30 is not yet established. Duration of Therapy: Patients on treatment for HBV and HIV should receive therapy indefinitely (CIII). Alternative TherapyIf the Patient Refuses ART: Anti-HBV therapy is indicated for all those who meet criteria for treatment according to the AASLD 2018 guidelines. Peg-IFN-alfa 2a 180 mcg SQ once weekly for 48 weeks (CIII), or Peg-IFN- alfa 2b 1.5 mcg/kg SQ once weekly for 48 weeks (CIII) Directly acting HBV drugs (such as 3TC, FTC, T AF, TDV, entecavir, adefovir, and telbivudine) must not be given in the absence of a fully suppressive ART regimen to avoid selection of drug resistant HIV (AII). Other Considerations: Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all HA V antibody-negative patients who have chronic liver disease, are men who have sex with men, or who are injection drug users (AIII). Antibody responses to HA V should be assessed 1 month after completion of vaccination series. If HAV Ab IgG is negative, patients should be revaccinated when the CD4 count is >200 cells/mm3 (BIII). As patients with HBV/HCV/HIV coinfection appear to have accelerated liver fibrosis progression, high risk of HCC, and increase d mortality, treatment for both HBV and HCV infection should be initiated, if feasible. As HBV reactivation can occur during treatment for HCV with directly active agents (DAAs) in the absence of HBV -active drugs, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection who will be treated for HCV should be on HBV-active ART at the time of HCV treatment initiation (AIII). When changing AR T regimens, it is crucial to continue agents with anti-HBV activity (BIII). If anti-HBV therapy must be discontinued, serum transaminase levels should be monitored ever y 6 weeks for 3 months, then every 3 to 6 months thereafter. If a hepatic flare occurs after drug discontinuation, HBV therapy should be re-instituted, as it can be potentially lifesaving (AIII). If immunosuppressive therapy is given, HBV reactivation can occur . For patients who are HBsAg positive, treatment for HBV should be administered (AII). Patients with isolated anti-HBc can either be monitored or be given prophylaxis to prevent reactivation depending on the degree of immunosuppression and whether HBV DNA is detectable (AII).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV M-1Hepatitis C Virus Infection (Last updated October 28, 2014; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus; the estimated worldwide prevalence of HCV infection is 2% to 3%, which translates to an estimated 170 million infected individuals of whom approximately 3.2 million live in the United States. 1 Seven distinct HCV genotypes have been described.2 Genotype 1 infection accounts for approximately 75% of infections in the United States and approximately 90% of infections among blacks. 3,4 Both HIV and HCV can be transmitted by percutaneous exposure to blood or blood products, through sexual intercourse, and from a mother to her infant; however, the relative efficiency of transmission by these routes varies substantially. Approximately, 20% to 30% of HIV-infected patients in the United States are coinfected with HCV . 5,6 HCV is approximately 10 times more infectious than HIV through percutaneous blood exposures and has been shown to survive for weeks in syringes. 7-9 Transmission via injection drug use remains the most common mode of acquisition in the United States while transmission through contaminated blood products is now rare. Health care-associated transmission of HCV also can occur as a result of improper reuse of parenteral medications and equipment. 10-12 Other factors that have been associated with HCV infection include accidental occupation-related needlestick injuries, intranasal cocaine use, chronic hemodialysis, and tattoo placement. Heterosexual transmission of HCV is uncommon but more likely in those whose partners are coinfected with HIV and HCV . 13,14 Existing data also suggest that sexual contact is a relatively inefficient mode of transmission between HIV seronegative men who have sex with men (MSM).15 However, in HIV-infected MSM, multiple outbreaks of acute HCV infection demonstrate that sexual transmission is an important mode of acquisition in this population. 16 Risk factors include unprotected receptive anal intercourse, use of sex toys, non-injection recreational drug use, and concurrent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).15,17- 19,20,21 Temporally, the increase in the incidence of sexual transmission of HCV among HIV-infected MSMs coincides with an increase in high-risk sexual behaviors following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). 22,23 Mother-to-child transmission of HCV infection occurs in approximately 1% to 3% of infants born to HCV-seropositive mothers without and 4% to 7% of infants born to HCV-seropositive mothers with detectable plasma HCV RNA levels. 24-27 Incidence of mother-to-child HCV transmission is increased when mothers are HIV-coinfected, reaching rates of 10% to 20%.28,29 Clinical Manifestations Both acute and chronic HCV infections are usually minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic. Fewer than 20% of patients with acute infection have characteristic symptoms, including low-grade fever, mild right-upper-quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dark urine, and jaundice. Unexplained elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels may be the only laboratory finding during acute and chronic infection. Recognition of acute HCV infection in patients with new-onset liver enzyme elevations is clinically important since HCV treatment during the early phases of infection is more efficacious than treatment during the chronic phase. 30,31 Cirrhosis develops in approximately 20% of patients with chronic HCV infection within 20 years after infection, although the risk for an individual is highly variable. 32,33 Risk factors for development of significant liver disease include older age at the time of infection, male sex, obesity, and concomitant alcohol use. 33,34 HIV coinfection adversely affects the course of HCV infection, resulting in significantly accelerated Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV M-2progression of liver disease to cirrhosis, particularly in those with immunodeficiency (CD4 <200 cells/mm3).35,36 progress more rapidly to life-limiting outcomes such as end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than do those who are HCV-monoinfected. 37,38 Because of its high prevalence and accelerated progression, HCV disease is a leading non-AIDS cause of death in HIV-infected individuals.39-41 In addition to liver disease, HCV may be associated with symptomatic vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia (largely affecting the skin), renal disease (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis), and porphyria cutanea tarda. Diagnosis On entry into HIV care, all HIV-infected patients should undergo routine HCV screening. Initial testing for HCV should be performed using the most sensitive immunoassays licensed for detection of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in blood. 42 For at risk HCV-seronegative individuals, HCV antibody testing is recommended annually or as indicated by risk exposure. False-negative anti-HCV antibody results are possible but are uncommon (<1%) in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression.43,44 In addition, negative anti-HCV antibody results can occur during acute infection. Following acute HCV infection, the duration of the window period prior to seroconversion is highly variable, ranging from 2 weeks to 12 weeks. Serum ALT levels are frequently elevated early in the course of acute infection and high ALT levels should prompt testing for HCV RNA if serologic test results are negative or indeterminate in individuals at risk of HCV infection. 45 Individuals who test positive for HCV antibody should undergo confirmatory testing by using a sensitive quantitative assay to measure plasma HCV RNA level. Importantly, plasma HCV RNA viral load does not correlate with HCV disease severity, and therefore, should not be monitored serially in patients not taking HCV treatment. Plasma HCV RNA levels do provide important prognostic information about the likelihood of response to HCV treatment. Preventing Exposure The primary route of HCV transmission is drug injection via a syringe or other injection paraphernalia (i.e., \"cookers,\" filters, or water) previously used by an infected person. HCV-seronegative injection drug users should be encouraged to stop using injection drugs by entering a substance abuse treatment program or, if they are unwilling or unable to stop, to reduce the risk of transmission by never sharing needles or injection equipment. 46-48 HCV also can be transmitted sexually, especially between HIV-infected MSM. HCV-seronegative patients must be counseled regarding the risk of sexual acquisition. The effectiveness of male condoms in reducing HCV transmission is unknown, nonetheless, barrier precautions are strongly recommended to reduce the risk of STDs, including HCV (BIII). 49 Preventing Disease There is no vaccine or recommended post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HCV infection. Following acute HCV infection, chronic infection may be prevented within the first 6 to 12 months after infection through antiviral treatment; relatively high rates of viral clearance have been observed with HCV treatment during the acute phase of infection. 50,51 However, patients also have the potential for spontaneous clearance after acute infection; as such, some experts recommend observation of acutely infected patients\u2014particularly those whose infection (e.g., those with C/C IL28B genotype) is more likely to resolve\u2014for approximately 3 to 6 months before initiating HCV treatment. 52 In the setting of evolving data, recommendations for management of acute HCV infection in HIV-infected patients are expected to change rapidly. Clinicians should refer to the most recent HCV treatment guidelines (http://www.hcvguidelines.org) for the most up-to-date guidance. HCV-infected individuals should be counseled about methods to prevent liver damage by avoiding any alcohol consumption (as alcohol accelerates progression of liver disease), limiting ingestion of Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV M-3potentially hepatotoxic medications (e.g., acetaminophen should be limited to <2 g/day), and avoiding iron supplementation in the absence of documented iron deficiency.53 HCV-infected patients should be tested for previous or concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection because co-infection with HBV is associated with increased morbidity. Those without evidence of immunity to HBV should be vaccinated (see Hepatitis B Virus Infection section). Likewise, because acute hepatitis A virus (HA V) infection is more likely to be fulminant in HCV-infected individuals, these patients should be screened for immunity (HA V IgG or antibody total) and those susceptible should be vaccinated (BIII). Coinfected patients with cirrhosis are at risk of life-threatening complications and should be managed in consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist. In particular, individuals with cirrhosis should undergo serial screening for HCC; 54 some experts recommend performing ultrasonography at 6- to 12-month intervals, although the optimal screening strategy is unknown. Because of its relatively poor specificity and sensitivity, alfa-fetoprotein should not be the sole screening method. HIV infection is not an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation; accordingly, coinfected patients with decompensated liver disease and/or early HCC may be considered for transplantation at specialized transplant centers. Although earlier studies focused on the potential for antiretroviral (ARV)-associated liver injury with certain agents, more recent studies have found that effective HIV treatment is associated with reduced risk of liver disease progression. Coinfected patients should be treated with ART in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents developed by the Department of Health and Human Services Panel. 55 Dose adjustment of certain ARV agents may be needed in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Treating Disease In general, the goals of therapy, treatment regimen, and monitoring parameters for HIV/HCV coinfected patients are similar to those recommended for HCV monoinfected patients. The field of HCV drug development is evolving rapidly. The armamenarium of approved drugs is likely to expand considerably in the next few years. Clinicians should refer to the most recent HCV treatment guidelines ( http://www. hcvguidelines.org ) for the most up-to-date recommendations. Special Considerations During Pregnancy Pregnant HIV-infected women should be tested for HCV infection to allow appropriate management for the mothers during pregnancy and after delivery, and also for their infants. 56 HCV treatment with PegIFN and ribavirin is contraindicated during pregnancy (AII). IFNs are abortifacient at high doses in monkeys and should not be used in pregnant women because of their direct antigrowth and antiproliferative effects. 57 Ribavirin is an FDA category X drug because of its teratogenicity at low doses in multiple animal species. Defects noted in animals include limb abnormalities, craniofacial defects, exencephaly, and anophthalmia. Ribavirin should not be used during pregnancy (AII). Women of childbearing potential and men receiving ribavirin should be counseled about the risks and need for consistent contraceptive use during and for 6 months after completion of ribavirin therapy (AIII). Inadvertent pregnancy during paternal exposure was not associated with adverse events in two newborns. 58 Pregnancies that occur in women taking ribavirin or those in women whose male partner is taking the drug should be reported to the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry (800-593-2214 or http://www.ribavirinpregnancyregistry.com). Telaprevir, boceprevir, and sofosbuvir are Pregnancy Category B and simeprevir is Pregnancy Category C; however, these agents are often used in combination with PegIFN/ribavirin, which are not recommended in pregnancy. The FDA category assignment for these novel drugs, though, is based on safety in animal studies as there are no human data available. Evaluation of HCV-infected pregnant women, including liver biopsy, can be delayed until >3 months after delivery to allow potential pregnancy-related changes in disease activity to resolve. HA V and HBV vaccines can be administered during pregnancy and women who have not previously been vaccinated should receive them. Several studies have reported that perinatal transmission of HCV occurs more frequently in women Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV M-4with HIV/HCV-coinfection than in those with HCV monoinfection. However, data are limited regarding the role of medical or surgical interventions to reduce the risk of perinatal HCV transmission. Nearly all studies, including those in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women, have found that elective cesarean delivery does not reduce the risk of perinatal HCV transmission. 26,59-61 Moreover, there is an increased risk of maternal morbidity associated with cesarean compared with vaginal delivery, particularly in the setting of maternal HIV infection. 62-65 Thus, while elective cesarean delivery in HIV/HCV-coinfected women can be considered based on HIV-related indications, data are insufficient to support its routine use for prevention of HCV transmission.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV N-1Herpes Simplex Virus Disease (Last updated May 26 , 2020; last reviewed May 26, 2020) Epidemiology Infections with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are common. Among persons aged 14 to 49 years in the United States, the HSV-1 seroprevalence is 47.8%, and the HSV-2 seroprevalence is 11.9%. 1 While most cases of recurrent genital herpes are due to HSV-2, over the past decade, HSV-1 has become an increasing cause of first-episode genital herpes, causing up to 70% of infections in some populations, such as young adult women and men who have sex with men. 2 Approximately 70% of persons with HIV are HSV-2 seropositive, and 95% are seropositive for either HSV-1 or HSV-2. 3 HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition two- to three-fold,4,5 and in coinfected patients, HSV-2 reactivation results in increases in HIV RNA levels in blood and genital secretions.6 Clinical Manifestations Orolabial herpes (commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters) is the most common manifestation of HSV-1 infection. Classic manifestations of oral HSV-1 include a sensory prodrome in the affected area, rapidly followed by lesions on lips and oral mucosa that evolve in stages from papule to vesicle, ulcer, and crust. The course of illness in untreated patients is 5 days to 10 days. Lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year and can be triggered by sunlight or physiologic stress. Genital herpes is typically caused by HSV-2 and is the most common manifestation of HSV-2 infection. Increasingly, first-episode genital herpes is caused by HSV-1 and is indistinguishable from HSV-2 infection, although recurrences and viral shedding occur less often with genital HSV-1 infection. Typical genital mucosal or skin lesions evolve through stages of papule, vesicle, ulcer, and crust. Ulcerative lesions are usually the only stage observed on mucosal surfaces, but vesicles are commonly seen on skin on or around the genitals (e.g., the penile shaft, mon pubis, thighs). Local symptoms might include a sensory prodrome consisting of pain and pruritus. Mucosal disease is occasionally accompanied by dysuria or vaginal or urethral discharge. Inguinal lymphadenopathy is common with genital herpes, particularly in primary infection. 7 These classic manifestations occur in some patients, but most individuals with genital herpes have mild and atypical lesions that are often unrecognized. Regardless of the clinical severity of infection, viral shedding on mucosal surfaces occurs frequently and can result in transmission. HSV shedding occurs more frequently in persons with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <200 cells/mm 3 than in those with higher CD4 counts.8,9 An episode of genital HSV-1 disease is indistinguishable from genital HSV-2 disease, but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often with genital HSV-1 infection. HSV is a significant cause of proctitis in men with HIV infection who have sex with men and may not be associated with external anal ulcers.10 In profoundly immunocompromised patients, extensive, deep, nonhealing ulcerations can occur. These lesions have been reported most often in those with CD4 counts <100 cells/mm 3 and also may be associated with acyclovir-resistant HSV .11 In addition, atypical presentations such as hypertrophic genital HSV ,12,13 which mimics neoplasia and requires biopsy for diagnosis, may be seen in persons with HIV infection. The manifestations of non-mucosal HSV those observed in HIV-seronegative individuals. Disseminated HSV infection is rare, even in profoundly immunosuppressed patients. HSV retinitis manifests as acute retinal necrosis, which can lead rapidly to loss of vision. Diagnosis Because mucosal HSV infections cannot be diagnosed accurately by clinical examination, a laboratory diagnosis of all suspected HSV mucosal infections should be pursued. 14 HSV DNA polymerase chain Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV N-2reaction (PCR), and viral culture are preferred methods for diagnosis of mucocutaneous lesions potentially caused by HSV . PCR is the most sensitive method of diagnosis. HSV detected in genital lesions should be typed as HSV-1 or HSV-2. The frequency of recurrences is greater for HSV-2 than for HSV-1, and therefore knowledge of viral type is helpful for counseling purposes. Type-specific serologic assays are commercially available and can be used for diagnosis of HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions. Type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 for persons with HIV infection can be considered. However, providers should be aware that there are some important limitations of currently available serologic tests. In particular, false positive HSV-2 serologic test results occur with the enzyme immunoassay antibody tests, particularly at low index values (1.1-3.5). 15-17 In such situations, confirmatory testing with a second serologic test is recommended in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. 18 A diagnosis of HSV-2 should be accompanied by counseling that includes discussion of the risk of transmitting infection to sex partners. Guidelines for counseling are provided in the 2015 CDC Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. 18 Serologic screening for HSV-1 infection is not recommended. Preventing Exposure Although most people with HIV also have HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections, it is important to prevent HSV-2 acquisition in those who do not have HSV-2. Persons with HIV who are HSV-2 seronegative should consider asking their partners to be tested using HSV type-specific serology before initiating sexual activity because disclosure of HSV-2 in heterosexual HIV-negative, HSV-2-discordant couples was associated with reduced risk of transmission of HSV-2 (BII). 19 Consistent use of latex condoms reduced HSV-2 acquisition among heterosexual couples, and their use should be encouraged to prevent transmission of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). 20,21 Sexual transmission of HSV most often occurs during episodes of asymptomatic viral shedding. However, persons with HIV should specifically avoid sexual contact with partners who have overt genital or orolabial herpetic lesions (AII). In HSV-2 seropositive persons who have symptomatic genital herpes but not HIV , suppressive antiviral therapy (e.g., valacyclovir 500 mg once daily) reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible heterosexual partners by 48%. 22 However, in HIV-1/HSV-2-seropositive persons not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive acyclovir (400 mg twice daily) did not prevent HSV-2 transmission to HSV-2 seronegative partners. 23 Suppressive anti-HSV therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners is not recommended for persons with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection who are not on ART (AI). There are no data available regarding use of suppressive therapy to prevent genital HSV-1 transmission. Preventing Disease Prophylaxis with antiviral drugs to prevent primary HSV infection is not recommended (AIII). In clinical trials, pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaginal tenofovir oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or with TDF/emtricitabine has been associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 acquisition in persons without HIV . 24-26 However, HSV-2 seronegative persons with HIV on TDF-containing ART regimens are at similar risk of acquiring HSV-2 as those on non-TDF containing ART regimens, suggesting that TDF is not effective in preventing HSV-2 acquisition in persons with HIV infection. 27 The dose, duration, timing, and efficacy of anti-HSV prophylaxis after known or suspected exposure to HSV has not been evaluated. No vaccine for prevention of HSV infection is available. Some studies have shown that medical male circumcision (MMC) decreased the risk of HSV-2 acquisition in African men without HIV , 28,29 and may be associated with decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to female partners.30 However, MMC to decrease risk of HSV-2 acquisition and transmission has not been studied among men with HIV and therefore is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing HSV acquisition (AIII) . Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV N-3Treating Disease Patients with HSV infections can be treated with episodic antiviral therapy when symptomatic lesions occur or with daily suppressive therapy to prevent recurrences. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective for suppressive and episodic therapy. Valacyclovir is the prodrug of acyclovir, and has improved oral bioavailability, with decreased dosing frequency, compared to acyclovir. When deciding on suppressive therapy for genital HSV-2 infection in persons with HIV and HSV-2 coinfection, factors to consider include the frequency and severity of HSV recurrences and risk for genital ulcer disease (GUD) when initiating ART. 31 Episodic treatment for individual recurrences of GUD does not influence the natural history of genital HSV-2 infection. Patients with orolabial HSV lesions can be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 5 days to 10 days (AIII) . First episodes of genital HSV should be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7 days to 10 days; recurrences can be treated for 5 to 10 days (AI). Severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions respond best to initial treatment with intravenous (IV) acyclovir (AIII) .11,32 Once the lesions begin to regress, patients can be switched to oral antiviral therapy. Therapy should be continued until the lesions have completely healed. Although disseminated disease due to HSV is rare in persons with HIV , HSV necrotizing retinitis can occur, which may be difficult to distinguish clinically from retinitis caused by varicella-zoster virus. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting Antiretroviral Therapy Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV . Transient increases in HSV-2-associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons. In such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART. However, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding. 33 Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are occasionally associated with nausea or headache. No laboratory monitoring is needed for patients receiving episodic or suppressive HSV therapy unless they have advanced renal impairment. However, for patients receiving high-dose IV acyclovir, monitoring of renal function, and dose adjustment as necessary, are recommended at initiation of treatment and once or twice weekly for the duration of treatment. HSV-2 shedding and GUD can increase in the first 6 months after initiation of ART, particularly in those with low CD4 counts. 34,35 Mucocutaneous lesions that are atypical and occasionally recalcitrant to therapy have been reported in individuals initiating ART and have been attributed to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). 36 Managing Treatment Failure Treatment failure due to acyclovir resistance should be suspected if herpes-related lesions do not begin to resolve within 7 days to 10 days after initiation of anti-HSV therapy. In persons with suspected acyclovir-resistant HSV , viral culture of the lesion should be performed, and if virus is isolated, susceptibility testing done to confirm drug resistance (AII). 37 Phenotypic testing of viral isolates has been the gold standard method for assessing HSV resistance; genotypic testing is not yet available. The treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant HSV is IV foscarnet (AI).38,39 IV cidofovir is novel agent, the helicase-primase inhibitor pritelivir, is currently being testing in clinical trials for treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes in immunocompromised persons ( ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03073967). There is an Expanded Access Program available for oral pritelivir in these populations; for more information see AiCuris Pritelivir Early Access website . Topical trifluridine, foscarnet, Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV N-4cidofovir, and imiquimod also have been used successfully to treat external lesions, although prolonged application for 21 days to 28 days or longer may be required (CIII) .40-44 Preventing Recurrence Suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir is effective in preventing recurrences of HSV lesions and is preferred for patients who have severe or frequent HSV recurrences or who want to minimize the frequency of recurrences (AI). 14,45 Suppressive therapy for HSV may be continued indefinitely, without regard to improved CD4 count, although the need for continued therapy should be addressed on an annual basis, particularly if immune reconstitution has occurred (BIII). Persons starting ART with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm 3 have an increased risk of HSV-2 shedding and GUD in the first 6 months on ART. Suppressive acyclovir decreases the risk of GUD nearly 60%, and may be recommended for persons with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm 3 starting ART (BI). In persons with HIV not on ART, suppressive anti-HSV therapy also results in a decrease in HIV RNA levels in plasma, anal, and genital secretions, and in a lower risk of HIV progression. 46 However, antiviral regimens for herpes do not decrease the risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners, and should not be used in place of ART to delay HIV progression. 47 In persons who are taking ART, suppressive HSV antivirals do not delay HIV progression, improve CD4 recovery, or decrease markers of systemic inflammation48,49 and are not useful for these ends (AI). Although there is no data specific to persons with HIV , in hematopoietic stem cell recipients, the risk of developing acyclovir-resistant HSV was lower with daily suppressive acyclovir therapy than with episodic therapy. 50 Special Considerations During Pregnancy Laboratory testing to diagnose mucocutaneous HSV infections is the same for pregnant women as for non-pregnant women. Episodic therapy for first-episode HSV disease and for recurrences can be offered during pregnancy. Visceral disease following HSV acquisition is more likely to occur during pregnancy and can be fatal. Acyclovir is the antiviral drug with the most reported experience in pregnancy and appears to be safe, particularly during the second and third trimesters (AIII) . 51 One recent case-control study suggested a higher risk of gastroschisis associated with both genital herpes and acyclovir use during the first trimester of pregnancy. 52 The use of valacyclovir and famciclovir during pregnancy has been described, and the antiviral drugs also appear to be safe and well tolerated during the third trimester.53 Given its simplified dosing schedule valacyclovir is an option for treatment and suppressive therapy during pregnancy (CIII) . An additional concern with HSV during pregnancy is the potential for HSV transmission to the fetus or neonate. The rate of neonatal HSV transmission in HSV-2-seropositive pregnant women is low, except in those who acquire genital HSV infection late in pregnancy. However, when HSV transmission does occur, the adverse sequelae for the neonate can be very significant. The predominant risk for neonatal HSV transmission is maternal genital shedding of HSV at delivery. Cesarean delivery is recommended for women with a genital herpes prodrome or visible HSV genital lesions at the onset of labor (BII). 14 Use of acyclovir or valacyclovir in late pregnancy suppresses genital herpes outbreaks and reduces the need for cesarean delivery for recurrent HSV in HIV-seronegative women 54 and is likely to have similar efficacy in women with HIV infection. However, neonatal HSV disease has been reported in infants born to women treated with antenatal suppressive antiviral therapy. 55 Suppressive therapy with either valacyclovir or acyclovir is recommended starting at 36 weeks' gestation for pregnant women with recurrences of genital herpes during pregnancy (BII).56 Suppressive therapy for women who are seropositive for HSV-2 but no history of genital lesions is not recommended. Maternal genital herpes was a risk factor for perinatal HIV transmission in the era preceding availability of ART. 57 Whether HSV facilitates HIV transmission in pregnant women on ART is unknown. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV N-5Recommendations for Treating Herpes Simplex Virus Infections Note: Compared to acyclovir, valacyclovir has improved bioavailability and requires frequent dosing.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV O-1Histoplasmosis (Last updated September 13, 2019; last reviewed September 13, 2019) Epidemiology Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. The fungal infection is endemic to the central and south-central United States, where it is especially common in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Histoplasmosis is also found in Latin America and the Caribbean and less commonly in other parts of the world. In endemic areas, the annual incidence rate may approach 5% among individuals with HIV . A CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count <150 cells/mm 3 is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic illness in people with HIV .1,2 Histoplasmosis is acquired by inhalation of microconidia that form in the mycelial phase of the fungus in the environment. Asymptomatic dissemination of infection beyond the lungs is common, and cellular immunity is critical in controlling infection. Diminished cellular immunity can lead to reactivation of a quiescent focal infection acquired years early; this is the presumed mechanism for disease occurrence in nonendemic areas. Clinical Manifestations In patients with HIV , common clinical manifestations of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. Cough, chest pain, and dyspnea occur in approximately 50% of patients. 1,3 Central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal (GI), and cutaneous manifestations occur in a smaller percentage of patients. Approximately 10% of patients experience shock and multi-organ failure. Patients with CNS histoplasmosis typically experience fever and headache, and if brain involvement is present, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and changes in mental status. 4 GI disease usually manifests as diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss.5 In a case series of patients with AIDS in Panama, diarrhea was seen in 50% of the patients with histoplasmosis.6 For patients with CD4 counts >300 cells/mm3, histoplasmosis is often limited to the respiratory tract and usually presents with cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fever. Diagnosis Detection of Histoplasma antigen in blood or urine is a sensitive method for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis7 but is insensitive for chronic forms of pulmonary infection. In a study using a newer quantitative assay, Histoplasma antigen was detected in 100% of urine samples and 92% of serum samples from people with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis.8 Antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may also be useful method for diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis.9 In patients with severe disseminated histoplasmosis, peripheral blood smears can show the organisms engulfed by white blood cells, and histopathological examination of biopsy material from involved tissues often demonstrate the characteristic 2 to 4 \u00b5m in diameter budding yeast cells. H. capsulatum can be cultured from blood (using the lysis-centrifugation technique), bone marrow, respiratory secretions, or from samples from other involved sites in >85% of patients with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis, but the organism requires several weeks to grow. 10 Serologic tests are less useful than antigen assays in patients with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis but may be helpful in patients with pulmonary disease who have reasonably intact immune responses. 10,11 The diagnosis of Histoplasma meningitis is often difficult. The usual cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose. Fungal stains are usually negative, and CSF cultures are positive in a minority of cases. 4 In a recent review of CNS histoplasmosis that included patients with HIV infection, cultures were positive in 38% of patients.12 Histoplasma antigen can be detected in CSF in a far greater number of cases, and antibodies against H. capsulatum are seen in approximately one-half of cases.12 A positive antigen or antibody test result from CSF is diagnostic for histoplasmosis. In cases in which none of these specific tests is positive, a presumptive diagnosis of Histoplasma meningitis is appropriate if the patient has disseminated histoplasmosis and findings of CNS infection not attributable to another cause. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV O-2Preventing Exposure Individuals with HIV who live in or visit areas in which histoplasmosis is endemic cannot completely avoid exposure to H. capsulatum , but those with CD4 counts <150 cells/mm3 should avoid activities associated with an increased risk for histoplasmosis (BIII) . These activities include creating dust when working with surface soil; cleaning chicken coops; disturbing areas contaminated with bird or bat droppings; cleaning, remodeling, or demolishing old buildings; and exploring caves. Preventing Disease Data from a prospective, randomized, controlled trial indicate that itraconazole can reduce the frequency of histoplasmosis, although not mortality, in patients who have advanced HIV and who live in areas in which histoplasmosis is highly endemic. 13 Some experts would give prophylaxis with itraconazole at a dose of 200 mg daily to patients with CD4 counts <150 cells/mm3 who are at high risk because of occupational exposure or who live in a community with a hyperendemic rate of histoplasmosis (>10 cases/100 patient-years) (BI). If used, primary prophylaxis can be discontinued in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) once CD4 counts are 150 cells/mm 3 for 6 months and HIV-1 viral load is undetectable (BIII) . Prophylaxis should be restarted falls to <150 cells/mm3 (BIII) . a intravenous (IV) liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg daily) was more effective than standard IV amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg daily); the liposomal formulation induced a more rapid and complete response, lowered mortality rates, and reduced toxicity. 14 Based on these findings, patients with moderately severe to severe disseminated histoplasmosis should be treated with IV liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg daily) for 2 weeks or until they clinically improve (AI). Amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg daily) can be used if cost is a concern or patient cannot tolerate liposomal amphotericin B (AIII) . Step-down therapy to oral itraconazole, 200 mg three times a day for 3 days, and then 200 mg two times a day, should be given for 12 months (AII) .15 Because absorption of itraconazole can be erratic and because of potential drug interactions between itraconazole and protease inhibitors, efavirenz, rilpivirine, etravirine, and many other drugs, random serum levels of itraconazole should be measured 2 weeks after the start of therapy. A serum level of 1 to 2 g/mL is recommended, and the number and severity of adverse events increase when levels are 4 \u00b5g/mL. 16 In patients with less severe disseminated histoplasmosis, oral itraconazole, 200 mg three times daily for 3 days followed by 200 mg twice daily, is appropriate initial therapy (AII) .15,17 The liquid formulation of itraconazole, which should be given on an empty stomach, is preferable because it is better absorbed and does not require gastric acid for absorption, but it is less well tolerated than the capsule formulation. The capsule formulation should be given with food and cannot be used when the patient requires gastric acid inhibiting drugs. A new formulation of itraconazole, SUBA-itraconazole, has improved absorption and may prove useful in treating histoplasmosis; however, this agent cannot be recommended, pending further data on its use for this purpose. The management of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in a patient with HIV who has a CD4 count >300 cells/mm 3 is the same as for an immunocompetent patient (AIII) .15 In patients with confirmed meningitis, liposomal amphotericin B should be administered as initial therapy at a dosage of 5 mg/kg IV daily for 4 to 6 weeks (AIII) . This initial IV therapy should be followed by maintenance therapy with oral itraconazole at a dose of 200 mg two or three times daily for 12 months and until resolution of abnormal CSF findings (AIII) .15 Oral posaconazole and voriconazole have been reported to be effective in treating histoplasmosis in a small number of patients with AIDS or other immunosuppressive conditions 18-21 and may be reasonable alternatives for patients who are only moderately ill and intolerant of itraconazole and for those who have Histoplasma meningitis and require long-term antifungal therapy (BIII) . If voriconazole is used, trough serum levels should be measured after 5 days of therapy with a goal of achieving a concentration of 2 to 5 ug/mL. Concentrations are highly Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV O-3variable among different patients and over time, within a given patient. Concentrations can vary because of absorption issues and drug-drug interactions. Neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are associated with serum levels >5 ug/mL, but individual patients can experience adverse effects with lower serum levels. Posaconazole serum levels should be measured after 5 days of therapy to ensure adequate absorption, with a goal of achieving a concentration >1 ug/mL. Fluconazole is less effective than itraconazole for treatment of histoplasmosis, but has been shown to be moderately effective at a dose of fluconazole 800 mg daily. At this dose, fluconazole may be a reasonable alternative for those intolerant of itraconazole and for long-term therapy for Histoplasma meningitis (CII) .22 Isavuconazole has been used in too few patients with histoplasmosis to be recommended at this time. The echinocandins do not have activity against H. capsulatum and should not be used to treat patients with histoplasmosis (AIII) . Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (including IRIS) Serial monitoring of serum or urine for Histoplasma antigen is useful for determining response to therapy. A rise in antigen level suggests relapse. Individuals with HIV diagnosed with histoplasmosis should be started on ART as soon as possible after initiating antifungal therapy (AIII) . Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been uncommonly reportedly in patients with HIV who have histoplasmosis.23,24 ART should, therefore, not be withheld because of concern for the possible development of IRIS (AIII) . All triazole antifungals have the potential for complex, and possibly bidirectional, interactions with certain antiretroviral agents and other anti-infective agents. Table 5 lists these interactions and recommendations for dosage adjustments, where feasible. Managing Treatment Failure Liposomal amphotericin B should be used in patients who are severely ill or who have failed to respond to initial azole antifungal therapy (AIII) . Oral posaconazole and oral voriconazole are reasonable alternatives for patients intolerant of itraconazole who are only moderately ill (BIII) ;18-21 fluconazole at a dose of 800 mg daily also can be used (CII) .22 Drug interactions may limit the use of voriconazole in patients who are taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors. Posaconazole has fewer known drug interactions with ART medications than voriconazole. Prevention of Relapse Long-term suppressive therapy with itraconazole (200 mg daily) should be administered to patients with severe disseminated infection or CNS infection (AIII) and after re-induction therapy to those whose disease relapsed despite initial receipt of appropriate therapy (BIII) . Fluconazole is less effective than itraconazole for this purpose but has some efficacy at 400 mg daily.25,26 The role of voriconazole or posaconazole has not been evaluated in sufficiently powered studies. An AIDS Clinical Treatment Group (ACTG)-sponsored study reported that it was safe to discontinue itraconazole treatment for histoplasmosis in patients who had received >1 year of itraconazole therapy; had negative fungal blood cultures, a Histoplasma serum or urine antigen <4.1 units, and CD4 counts 150 cells/mm3; and had been on ART for 6 months.25 No relapses were evident among 32 study participants who were followed for a median of 24 months. Thus, it appears safe to discontinue suppressive azole antifungal therapy in patients who meet the criteria described above, have a serum or urine antigen below the limit of quantification in ng/mL (current terminology that replaces the term \"units\"), and have an undetectable viral load (AI). Suppressive therapy should be resumed if the CD4 count decreases to <150 cells/mm3 (BIII) .25 Special Considerations During Pregnancy Amphotericin B or its lipid formulations are the preferred initial regimen for the treatment of histoplasmosis Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV O-4in pregnant patients. Extensive clinical experience with amphotericin B has not documented teratogenicity. At delivery, infants born to women treated with amphotericin B should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. Although there are case reports of birth defects in infants exposed to itraconazole, prospective cohort studies of >300 women with first trimester exposure did not show an increased risk of congenital malformation. 27,28 However, in general, azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy (BIII) . Congenital malformations similar to those observed in animals, including craniofacial and limb abnormalities, have been reported in infants born to mothers who received fluconazole at doses 400 mg/day throughout or beyond the first trimester of pregnancy. 29 Although several cohort studies have shown no increased risk of birth defects with early pregnancy exposure, most of these studies involved low doses and short-term exposure to fluconazole. 30,31 On the basis of the reported birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration has changed the pregnancy category for fluconazole for any use other than a single, low dose for treatment of vaginal candidiasis from category C to category D (see the FDA Drug Safety Communication). In animals, voriconazole (at doses lower than recommended human doses) and posaconazole are teratogenic and embryotoxic. There are no adequately controlled studies of these drugs in humans. Use of voriconazole and posaconazole should be avoided in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester (AIII) .

Random serum concentrations (itraconazole plus hydroxyitraconazole) should be between 1 to 2 \u00b5g/mL. Concentrations >4 \u00b5g/mL are associated with increased frequency and severity of adverse effects. Itraconazole oral solution is preferred over the capsule formulation because of improved absorption but is less well tolerate d. However, it is not necessary to use the oral solution if itraconazole concentration is >1.0 \u00b5g/mL with the capsule formulation. V oriconazole trough serum levels should be measured after 5 days of therapy (time it usually takes to reach steady state) with a goal of achieving a concentration of 2 to 5 ug/mL. Levels are highly variable among patients, and for individual patients, levels can vary because of drug-drug interactions. Neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are associated with serum levels >5 ug/mL, but individual patients can experience adverse effects with lower serum levels. T rough posaconazole serum levels should be measured after 5 days of therapy (time it usually takes to reach steady state) to ensure adequate absorption, with a goal of achieving a concentration >1 ug/mL. Acute pulmonar y histoplasmosis in patients with HIV with CD4 count >300 cells/mm3 should be managed the same as in immunocompetent patients (AIII). All triazole antifungals have the potential to interact with certain AR T agents and other anti-infective agents. These interactions are complex and can be bidirectional. Drug-Drug Interactions in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines lists these interactions and recommends dosage adjustments where feasible.Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Histoplasma capsulatum Infections (page 3 of 3) References 1.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV P-1Human Herpesvirus-8 Disease (Last updated May 29, 2018; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology The seroprevalence of human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)\u2014also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus worldwide and is estimated to be 1% to 5% in the general U.S. population1,2 compared with 10% to 20% in certain Mediterranean countries and 30% to 80% in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. 3 In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM) and persons with HIV infection are at increased risk for HHV-8 infection. Among MSM without HIV infection, the seroprevalence ranges from 13% to 20% and HHV-8 seroprevalence increases 30% to 35% among MSM with HIV infection. 4-6 Injection drug use may also be a risk factor for HHV-8 seropositivity,7 although this association has not been consistently observed.8 HHV-8 is etiologically associated with all forms of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) including classic, endemic, transplant-related, and AIDS-related, as rare neoplastic disorders (primary effusion lymphoma [PEL] and solid organ variants) the lymphoproliferative disorder known as multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). Although the precise pathogenesis for these tumors remains unclear, infection with HHV-8 precedes their development. 9 Patients who are HHV-8 seropositive and exhibit HHV-8 viremia are at increased risk (approximately nine-fold) for developing KS relative to those without HHV-8 viremia.10 viremia typically accompanies symptomatic episodes of multicentric Castleman's disease.11 The overall prevalence of KS in the U.S. was as high as 30% among patients with AIDS prior to the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). 12 The incidence of KS rose steeply in the United States between 1981 and 1987 and subsequently gradually declined.13 Reasons for this reduction in KS incidence prior to the widespread availability of ART include the deaths of patients with advanced AIDS who were most susceptible to KS, and the increasing use by individuals with HIV individuals of antiviral drugs that may have had activity against HHV-8 (zidovudine for the treatment of HIV; ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir use for treatment of CMV disease). 14 Supporting the latter hypothesis, observational studies indicate that patients receiving ganciclovir or foscarnet (but not acyclovir) develop KS at a reduced rate.15-18 A more marked reduction in KS incidence occurred beginning in 1996, shortly after the introduction of protease inhibitor-containing ART in the U.S. Despite these declines, KS is among the most common cancers among the AIDS population in the U.S., 19 and HIV infection increases the risk of KS several thousand fold even in the ART era.20 Notably, KS is a common cancer in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa,21 fueled in part by the HIV pandemic, and incidence has not declined in regions of sub-Saharan Africa where ART coverage is increasing but incomplete. 22,23 PEL and MCD remain rare relative to KS.24,25 KS and PEL are described most frequently among individuals with HIV exhibiting advanced immunosuppression (CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell counts <200 cells/mm 3), although they may occur at any CD4 cell count. Recent reports of KS occurring at higher CD4 cell counts in the United States26,27 suggest that clinicians caring for patients with HIV should be vigilant for the clinical manifestations of KS in patients at risk of HHV-8 infection, regardless of CD4 cell count. MCD may arise at any CD4 cell count. Clinical Manifestations Most individuals latently infected with HHV-8 are asymptomatic.28 Immunocompetent children and organ transplant recipients infected with HHV-8 may develop a primary infection syndrome consisting of fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, bone marrow failure, and occasional rapid progression to KS. 29,30 KS manifestations vary widely, but most patients have nontender, hyperpigmented, macular or nodular skin lesions. Oral lesions occur in approximately one-third of patients 31 and are predictors of pulmonary involvement and less favorable treatment outcomes.32-34 Lymphatic involvement is also common and may lead to debilitating lower extremity edema. Involvement of internal viscera occurs in up to 50% of cases and may be difficult Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV P-2to diagnose. Patients with visceral involvement may be asymptomatic, or manifest with shortness of breath, painless rectal bleeding or melena, and other non-specific pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms.35-40 PEL characteristically presents with effusions isolated within the pleural, pericardial, or abdominal cavities,41 but mass lesions and \"extracavitary\" disease within skin, hematopoietic organs, and the gastrointestinal tract have been described. 42-44 MCD routinely manifests with systemic symptoms including fever and night sweats, and findings on examination including generalized adenopathy, fever and hepatosplenomegaly.24,45 MCD may mimic other inflammatory conditions including sepsis, with hypotension, clinical evidence of a systemic inflammatory response, and progression to multi-organ failure. 24,46,47 Another HHV-8- associated condition, the KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), has been more recently described. 48-50 Patients with this syndrome display MCD-like inflammatory symptoms, but do not have pathological findings of MCD. Patients with KICS are frequently critically ill and demonstrate marked elevations in IL-6 and IL-10, as well as high plasma HHV-8 viral loads. KICS may contribute to the inflammatory symptoms seen in some patients with severe KS or PEL, and there may be significant clinical overlap between these conditions. Diagnosis The diagnoses of KS, MCD, and PEL depend on cytologic and immunologic cell markers, as well as histology. Clinical diagnosis alone is not sufficient for KS, and tissue examination is needed to confirm the diagnosis. 51,52 Confirmation of these diagnoses is achieved through immunohistochemical staining of tumors with antibodies recognizing the HHV-8-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA).53,54 While not commercially available, diagnoses may also be confirmed utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify HHV-8 DNA within tumor tissue. 53,54 Use of serologic testing for HHV-8 antibodies is currently not indicated for either diagnostic testing or routine screening for HHV-8-related illnesses due to lack of standardization and poor sensitivity and specificity of these assays. 55 In addition, use of PCR to quantify HHV-8 in the peripheral blood has no established role in the diagnosis of KS, MCD, or PEL.11 HHV-8 Transmission/Preventing Exposure The mode(s) of HHV-8 remains unclear, but epidemiologic and virologic data suggest that saliva is a source of infectious virus and may be an important route of transmission. Asymptomatic HHV-8 infection is often associated with HHV-8 shedding in the saliva and occasional shedding in genital secretions. 4,28,56 In a study of 50 HHV-8-infected MSM in the U.S., HHV-8 was detected by PCR in the saliva of 39% of participants and on more than 35% of days on which samples were obtained.4 HHV-8 shedding is also common among persons in sub-Saharan Africa. Among HHV-8-infected adults without KS in Uganda, 22% had HHV-8 DNA detected in saliva and 3% in genital secretions; HHV-8 was also detected in saliva of 68% of commercial sex workers in Kenya. 57,58 Based on these observations, viral shedding may result in HHV-8 transmission to uninfected partners through behaviors associated with exposure to saliva or genital secretions. HHV-8 transmission through blood transfusion has been reported in Uganda, where HHV-8 is endemic; 59 however, studies from the U.S. and Western Europe have not found evidence to support HHV-8 transmission through blood transfusion.60,61 Recommendations to prevent exposure to HHV-8 do not yet exist; screening patients for HHV-8 serostatus or behavioral modifications to limit potential exposures have not been validated and are not currently recommended. Preventing Disease Despite observational evidence supporting a role for anti-HHV-8 therapy in preventing the development of KS, the toxicity of current anti-HHV-8 treatments outweighs the potential use for prophylaxis (AIII) . Because strong risk factors for the development of KS in HIV-positive individuals include both low CD4- Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV P-3positive T cell count62 and uncontrolled viremia,63 early initiation of ART is likely to be the most effective measure for the prevention of KS (AII). Although epidemiologic data are somewhat conflicting, there are no antiretroviral agents which have proven clearly superior for the prevention of KS.60-65 Therefore, specific classes of ART for prevention of KS or other HHV-8-associated illnesses are not recommended (AII). Treating Disease KS: Chemotherapy, in combination with ART, should be administered to patients with visceral involvement (AI) and is likely to be a useful adjunctive therapy in individuals with disseminated cutaneous KS (BIII).64- 67 Liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel and progression-free survival, although liposomal doxorubicin exhibits less high-grade toxicity relative to paclitaxel and is, therefore, generally preferred as first-line therapy (AI). 64 Paclitaxel has proven effective with relapse following treatment failure with liposomal doxorubicin.67 Importantly, concurrent use of corticosteroids in patients with KS should be either avoided or used with caution and under close observation, given the potential for exacerbation of life-threatening disease, as well as an association between the use of corticosteroids and development of KS (AIII) . 68-70 KS arising in the setting of organ transplantation is related to the use of corticosteroids and other non-targeted immunosuppressives, especially in geographic areas of high HHV-8 seroprevalence. 71 Transplant-associated KS may be effectively treated or avoided with use of immunosuppressive regimens which include drugs that inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) such as rapamycin and sirolimus. 71-73 The antiviral agents ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir exhibit in vitro activity against HHV-8.74,75 Available data indicate that antivirals have limited efficacy for the treatment of KS (ganciclovir and cidofovir) 76,77 and HHV-8-associated hemophagocytosis (foscarnet).78,79 Therefore, antiviral agents with activity against HHV-8 are not recommended for KS treatment (AII). PEL: Chemotherapy, in combination with ART, should be administered to patients with PEL (AIII) , although, given its rarity, there are limited data available from longitudinal observational series or prospective randomized clinical trials. The combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) in combination with ART has demonstrated some benefit, albeit still limited, for PEL, and the combination of infusional etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (EPOCH) demonstrated superior survival relative to CHOP in one pooled analysis (BII). 80,81 Rituximab may be considered for rare CD20-positive cases of PEL (CIII) , and dose-adjusted EPOCH (DA-EPOCH) may be beneficial for some patients (CIII) .82,83 Antiviral agents, including valganciclovir or zidovudine, may also be used as adjunctive therapies, but available data are limited for this approach and additive toxicities may limit their utility (CIII) . 84-86 MCD: There are no standardized treatments for MCD, but several treatment regimens have been utilized. The use of either IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir are options for treatment of MCD (CII). A 3-week course of twice-daily IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir was associated with remissions in MCD in one report, 87 and a combination of valganciclovir and high-dose zidovudine has led to durable clinical remissions (CII).88 Rituximab has also emerged as an important adjunctive treatment for MCD (CII),89,90 although up to one-third of patients receiving rituximab may have subsequent exacerbations or emergence of KS.91,92 For patients with concurrent diagnoses of KS and MCD, use of both rituximab and liposomal doxorubicin is recommended (BII). 45 Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting either interleukin-6 (IL-6) or the IL-6 receptor have also proven effective for some patients with MCD and may be utilized in some situations (BII). 93-95 At this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend monitoring IL-6 levels for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Although corticosteroids are potentially effective as an adjunctive therapy for MCD, they should be used with caution or avoided, especially in patients with concurrent KS, given potential for exacerbation of life-threatening KS (AIII) Detailed recommendations for the treatment of HHV-8 malignancies (including chemotherapy and radiation therapy) are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Treatment should be undertaken in consultation with Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV P-4an experienced specialist with appropriate guidance from both oncology and infectious disease specialists (AIII) . Preferred ART to be given concurrently with chemotherapy for HHV-8 malignancies should be chosen to minimize drug-drug interactions and additive toxicities. Special Considerations When Starting Antiretroviral Therapy Early initiation of ART may prevent incident KS and PEL.74,96 ART that suppresses HIV replication should be administered to all patients with HIV and KS (AII), PEL (AIII) , or MCD (AIII) , although insufficient evidence exists to support using one ART regimen over another. Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may occur among HHV-8-infected patients initiating ART. KS: KS-IRIS is characterized by either first presentation of KS (\"unmasking\"), or paradoxical worsening of pre-existing KS following ART initiation, and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 97 Studies in the U.S. and Europe reveal that KS is the most commonly reported form of IRIS, occurring in 6% to 34% of KS patients with HIV who are initiating ART. 98,99 In sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbations of KS compatible with KS-IRIS have been reported in 18% to 61% of adults initiating ART treatment.100-102 Risk factors for developing KS-IRIS include advanced KS tumor stage (T1), pre-treatment >5 log10 copies/mL, detectable pre-treatment plasma HHV-8, and initiation of ART alone without concurrent chemotherapy. 97 Treatment of KS-IRIS includes systemic chemotherapy and supportive measures. Steroids are strongly discouraged for management of KS-IRIS, as corticosteroid therapy has been associated with exacerbation of pre-existing KS in persons with HIV (AIII). 70,103 PEL: No data exist on the frequency with which initiation of ART complicates the course of primary effusion lymphoma. MCD: A small number of patients with HIV-associated MCD have experienced clinical decompensation upon initiation of ART. 104,105 Although neither the incidence nor predictors of HHV-8-associated IRIS are well-described, suppression of HIV replication and immune reconstitution are key components of therapy, and initiation of ART should not be delayed (AIII) . Preventing Recurrence Effective suppression of HIV replication with ART in patients with HIV and KS may prevent KS progression or occurrence of new lesions. Because KS is an AIDS-defining cancer, ART is indicated for all patients with active KS (AII). Suppression of HIV replication to prevent recurrence is also recommended for patients with MCD (AIII) as well as those with malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (AIII) . Special Considerations During Pregnancy The seroprevalence of HHV-8 infection among pregnant women with HIV varies by geographic area, ranging from 1.7% among U.S.-born and 3.6% among Haitian-born women in New York City to 11.6% among pregnant women from 4 other U.S. cities. 106 Pregnancy does not appear to affect the prevalence of antibodies to HHV-8 or the antibody levels,107 although levels of HHV-8 DNA in the peripheral blood may increase late in pregnancy.108 HHV-8 seropositivity does not appear to influence pregnancy outcome. Routine screening for HHV-8 by PCR or serology is not indicated for pregnant women with HIV (AIII). Antiviral therapy for HHV-8 infection in pregnancy is not recommended (AIII) . Given the rarity of KS, PEL, and MCD in pregnancy and the potential toxicity of the drugs used for treatment, when these conditions occur in pregnancy, they should be managed with consultations between the obstetrician, infectious disease specialist, and oncologist. With limited disease, treatment may be deferred until after delivery. 109 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV P-5In vitro models suggest that beta-human chorionic gonadotropin induces regression of KS tumors, but clinical reports on the incidence and natural history of KS in pregnancy are conflicting.110-113 Perinatal transmission of HHV-8 occurs infrequently. Evidence supporting vertical transmission during pregnancy or the intrapartum period includes cases of KS occurring in the infant shortly after birth, 114,115 higher risk for transmission with higher maternal antibody titer (and, by inference, higher maternal levels of HHV-8),116 and detection of similar strains of HHV-8 DNA by PCR in specimens drawn at birth from HHV-8-seropositive mothers and their infants. 117 Data indicate increased mortality through age 24 months among infants with HIV born to HHV-8-seropositive mothers compared with HHV-8-seronegative mothers,114-116,118-123 but these studies could not completely account for other confounding factors affecting infants with HIV . The majority of studies document a substantially higher rate of HHV-8 seropositivity among children born to HHV-8 antibody-positive compared with HHV-8 antibody-negative women. Development of KS Since low CD4 cell count and uncontrolled HIV viremia are strong risk factors of KS, early initiation of AR T is likely to be the most effective measure for the prevention of KS (AII) Mild-to-Moderate KS (localized involvement of skin and/or lymph nodes)1 Initiation or optimization of AR T (AII) Advanced KS (visceral and/or disseminated cutaneous disease):1 Chemotherapy (in consultation with first-line chemotherapy A void use of corticosteroids in patients with KS, including those with KS-IRIS, given the potential for exacerbation of life- threatening disease (AIII) Antiviral agents with activity against HHV -8 are not recommended for KS treatment (AIII). PEL: Chemotherapy (in consultation with a specialist) (AIII) + ART (AIII) Oral valganciclovir or IV ganciclovir can be used as adjunctive therapy (CIII) MCD: All patients with MCD should receive ART (AIII) in conjunction with one of the therapies listed below. Therapy Options (in consultation with a specialist, and depending on HIV/HHV-8 status, presence of organ failure, and refractory nature of disease): IV ganciclovir (or dose zidovudine Rituximab liposomal doxorubicin IL-6 IL-6 receptor (BII) Corticosteroids are potentially effective as adjunctive therapy , but should be used with caution or avoided, especially in patients with concurrent KS. (AIII) Other Considerations: Patients who receive rituximab or corticosteroids for treatment of MCD may experience subsequent exacerbation or emergence of KS Key to Acronyms: ART = antiretroviral therapy; BID = daily; = orally; q(n)h = every \"n\" hours 1 The commonly used AIDS Clinical T rials Group (ACTG) KS Staging Classification uses T(Tumor), Immune(I), and Systemic illness (S) criteria to classify patients into \"Good Risk\" and \"Poor Risk\" categories (ref Krown, JCO, 1989). \"Good Risk\" tumor stage criteria are used by some specialists to correspond with mild-to-moderate KS.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-1Human Papillomavirus Disease (Last updated November 29, 2018; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major risk factor for development of cervical cancer,1,2 the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide.3,4 Nearly all cervical cancers test positive for HPV genetic sequences,5-7 most notably the E6 and E7 oncogenes,8-10 which are thought to play a major role in immortalization of cervical epithelial cells.11 Cervical infection with HPV is common and occurs primarily through sexual transmission.12-16 Penetrative sexual intercourse is not strictly necessary for HPV transmission,17 but it is the primary risk factor for HPV infection, and HPV prevalence is low in young women who report only non-penetrative sexual contact.17,18 The vast majority of cervical HPV infections resolve or become latent and undetectable, but in a subset of women, infection persists.12,19,20 Persistence of oncogenic HPV infection is a necessary step in HPV-related cervical tumorigenesis,1,21,22 although it appears insufficient for final cell transformation.11 At least 12 HPV types are considered oncogenic, including HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59.22-24 HPV68 is considered \"probably oncogenic,\" and several other HPV types are considered \"possibly oncogenic.\" HPV16 alone, though, accounts for approximately 50% of cervical cancers in the general population and HPV18 for another 10% to 15%. The other oncogenic HPV types each individually account for fewer than 5% of tumors. HPV types 6 and 11 cause 90% of genital warts, but are not considered oncogenic. 22-24 In the United States and Western Europe, women with HIV/AIDS have significantly higher rates of cervical cancer than women in the general population, 25-31 and recent cohort data show a direct relationship between low CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and cervical cancer risk.32 In Africa, the data are more limited and inconsistent,33 but a prospective registry-based study found increased risk of cervical cancer in women with HIV/AIDS.34 HIV infection and low CD4 cell count also have been consistently and strongly associated with HPV infection itself and with precancerous cervical lesions, including low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and the precursor to cervical cancer, CIN 3. 35-47 Higher rates of HPV infection and CIN are seen in adolescents with HIV , regardless of whether HIV was acquired vertically or horizontally.36,48,49 Brogly and colleagues reported that 30% of female adolescents with perinatal HIV infection had an abnormality (e.g., atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance [ASC-US] or greater) on their first Pap test; genital warts were also common in this group, with a cumulative rate of 12% by age 19 years. Other cancers caused by HPV include most anal cancers and a subset of tumors of the vulva, vagina, penis, oral cavity, and oropharynx. 1,23,50-52 HPV16 is the type present in most HPV-positive non-cervical cancers.1,23,50,53,54 Patients with HIV/AIDS also have a significantly elevated incidence of these tumors relative to the general population,25,55,56 and CD4 cell count has been related to risk of anal cancer.32 Furthermore, high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), the likely anal cancer precursor lesion, is more common in adults and adolescents who are HIV seropositive than in those who are HIV seronegative, 57-59 as are anal and genital warts, and in women, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (V AIN). 60-62 In the U.S. general population, HPV also causes approximately 70% of oropharyngeal cancers (OPC)63,64; 84% of HPV-associated HR HPV types contained the nine-valent HPV vaccine cause approximately 94%.65 HPV-associated OPC incidence is four- to five-fold higher in males than in females,66 and two- to three-fold higher among individuals with HIV infection.67 Despite the associations between HIV and CD4 cell count and HPV-related cancers and precancers, the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the incidence of HPV-related tumors is uncertain, and it is possible that the impact differs by tumor type. Some studies found decreased persistence/progression of CIN with ART, 68 including a study that distinguished between adherent and non-adherent ART use.69 Although several prior studies found the incidence of cervical cancer itself unchanged,55 and reported that anal cancer Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-2incidence was increasing55 more recent registry-based results have found significant decreases in cervical and anal cancer risk in men and women with HIV infection.70 Conversely, use of ART did not affect CIN rates in adolescents with perinatally or horizontally acquired HIV .36,49 The incidence of high-grade VIN was not reduced with ART use, even though rates of low-grade vulvar lesions and anal or genital warts did decrease with ART,60 and some71,72 but not other73,74 studies reported increased rates of oral warts following ART initiation. Overall, whether the burden of HPV-related cancers will decrease or even increase over time is difficult to currently gauge, as the risk of these cancers in individuals with HIV infection remains high relative to the general population, even if these differences are moderately decreasing. Further, the successful prolongation of life with use of ART for HIV suppression can also lead to increasing cumulative incidence of tumors over time, as well as potentially longer duration of HPV persistence, and accumulation of somatic mutations and epigenetic changes that contribute to carcinogenesis. This clinical scenario may be of particular concern for HPV-related cancers, such as anal cancers, that are not currently subject to routine screening. However, increasing use of HPV vaccination in adolescents and young adults may begin to reduce the risk of HPV-associated cancers in persons with HIV infection in later life. Clinical Manifestations The principal clinical manifestations of mucosal HPV infection are genital, oropharyngeal cancers are also caused by HPV . 75 Oral, genital (condyloma acuminata), and anal warts are usually flat, papular, or pedunculated growths on the mucosa or epithelium. The lesions may measure a few millimeters to 1 to 2 cm in diameter. Most warts are asymptomatic, but warts can be associated with itching or discomfort. In cases associated with more severe immunosuppression, marked enlargement may cause dyspareunia or dyschezia. Lesions of any size may cause cosmetic concerns. Intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN, VIN, V AIN, and AIN) are often asymptomatic but may manifest with bleeding or itching. Related cancers may also be asymptomatic or may manifest with bleeding, pain, odor, or a visible/palpable mass. External lesions may be visible or palpable. Similarly, squamous cell cancers at these sites also can be asymptomatic or may manifest with bleeding, pain, or a visible/palpable mass. Diagnosis Warts/Condyloma Diagnosis of genital and oral warts is made by visual inspection and can be confirmed by biopsy, although biopsy is needed only if the diagnosis is uncertain; the lesions do not respond to standard therapy; or warts are pigmented, indurated, fixed, bleeding, or ulcerated. No data support the use of HPV testing for screening, diagnosis, or management of visible genital/oral warts or oral HPV disease in patients HIV infection. 76 Cervical Neoplasia The same cytology (Pap test), and colposcopic techniques with biopsy are used to detect CIN among patients who are HIV seronegative and those who are HIV seropositive (see section on Preventing Disease). At the time of cytology screening, the genitalia and anal canal should be inspected carefully for visual signs of warts, intraepithelial neoplasia, or invasive cancer. Anal and Vulvar/Vaginal Neoplasia AIN, V AIN, and VIN are recognized through visual inspection, including high-resolution anoscopy, colposcopy, and biopsy as needed. A digital examination of the anal canal to feel for masses should be performed as part of routine evaluation. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-3Cervical Cancer Screening Recommendations Available HPV tests can detect up to 14 oncogenic HPV types in clinical specimens and are sensitive for the detection of cervical cancer precursors. Some commercially available HPV tests will specify whether the oncogenic HPV includes genotypes HPV16 or HPV16/18. The available tests for oncogenic HPV have been incorporated into the screening algorithms. Note: HPV testing is always for oncogenic HPV types only; there is no role in testing for non-oncogenic HPV . Possible Pap test results include: cells of undetermined significance) ASC-H (atypical cannot rule out a high-grade lesion) AGC (atypical glandular cells) Women With HIV Infection Aged <30 years Screening The Pap test is the primary mode for cervical cancer screening for women with HIV infection <30 years of age. Screening for these women should commence within 1 year of the onset of sexual activity regardless of mode of HIV transmission (e.g., sexual activity, perinatal exposure) but no later than age 21 years. Women with HIV infection ages 21 to 29 years should have a Pap test at the time of initial diagnosis with HIV . Provided the initial Pap test for a young (or newly diagnosed) woman with HIV infection is normal, the next Pap test should be in 12 months (BII). Some experts recommend a Pap test at 6 months after the baseline test (CIII). If the results of the 3 consecutive Pap tests are normal, follow-up Pap tests should be every 3 years (BII). Co-testing (Pap test and HPV test) is not recommended for women with HIV infection <30 years of age. Abnormal Pap Test Results For ASC-US Pap test, if reflex HPV testing is positive, a referral to colposcopy is recommended. If HPV testing is not available or not done, then repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months is recommended (AII). For any result equal to or greater than ASC-US on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII). For LSIL or worse (including ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL) referral to colposcopy is recommended (regardless of reflex HPV result, if done). Rationale These recommendations reflect evidence that women with HIV infection <21 years of age and sexually active may have a high rate of progression of abnormal cytology 36 (BII). No similar prospective data are available for adolescents who acquired HIV during the perinatal period, but as noted earlier, Brogly and colleagues reported that 30% of such adolescents had ASC-US or greater on their first cervical Pap test. 49 The mean age at the time of the first Pap test was 16.7 years, with a range of 13 to 23 years. Because of the relatively high HPV prevalence before age 30 years, HPV co-testing is not recommended for women in this age group who do not have HIV infection. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-4Women With HIV Infection Aged 30 years Cervical cancer screening in women with HIV infection should continue throughout a woman's lifetime (and not, as in the general population, end at 65 years of age). Either Pap testing only, or Pap testing and HPV co-testing is acceptable for screening. Pap Testing Only If screening with Pap tests alone, the woman with HIV infection should have a Pap test at the time of HIV diagnosis (baseline), then every 12 months (BII). Some experts recommend a Pap test at 6 months after the baseline test (CIII) . If the results of the 3 consecutive Pap tests are normal, follow-up Pap tests should be every 3 years (BII). Pap and HPV Co-Testing If co-testing with Pap and HPV is available, then co-testing can be done at the time of diagnosis or at age 30 years (BII). Women who co-test negative (i.e., a normal Pap and negative HPV test) can have their next cervical cancer screening in 3 years. Those with a normal Pap test but a positive HPV test should have repeat co-testing in one year (unless genotype testing for 16 or 16/18 is positive). If either of the co-tests at one year is abnormal (i.e., abnormal cytology or positive HPV), referral to colposcopy is recommended. If the initial HPV results identify HPV16 or HPV16/18, then referral to colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV testing is positive, but the genotype specific testing for HPV16 or HPV 16/18 is negative, then repeat co-testing in one year is recommended. If either of the co-tests at one year is abnormal (i.e., abnormal cytology or positive HPV), referral to colposcopy is recommended. Abnormal Pap Test Results For ASC-US Pap test, if reflex HPV testing is negative, a repeat Pap test in 6 to 12 months or repeat co-testing in 12 months is recommended. For any result ASC-US on repeat cytology , referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII). For ASC-US Pap test, if reflex HPV testing is positive, then referral to colposcopy is recommended. If HPV testing is not available, repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months is recommended (AII). For any result ASC-US on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII). For LSIL or worse (including ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL) referral to colposcopy is recommended (regardless of HPV result, if done). Rationale Current guidelines from both the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force allow for use of HPV co-testing with cytology. A negative HPV test predicts prolonged low risk of cancer. Cytology/HPV co-testing can allow for a prolonged cervical cancer screening interval in women with HIV infection who are older than 29 years and have normal cervical cytology with concurrent negative HPV testing. For women older than 65 years, it is recommended to continue cervical cancer screening as women with HIV infection are at higher risk for cervical cancer. However, clinicians should consider other factors such as the life expectancy of the patient and the risk for developing cervical cancer at this age. Preventing HPV Infection HPV Vaccine There are three FDA-approved 9-valent. Currently, only the 9-valent vaccine (HPV viral like particles 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) is available in the United States. This Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-5vaccine has an FDA indication for prevention of cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancer and genital warts due to vaccine types based on randomized clinical trial (RCT) data.77-79,80-83 Although there are no efficacy data with the 9-valent HPV vaccine in men, a clinical trial established the safety of the vaccine in young men aged 16 to 26 years and showed similar antibody concentrations as in the young women aged 16 to 26 years in whom efficacy was established. 84 Although there are no clinical trials to demonstrate HPV vaccine efficacy in prevention of oropharyngeal cancers, there is some evidence that the prevalence of oral vaccine-type HPV infections are reduced with vaccination. 85,86 One prospective trial of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in adults with HIV infection older than 27 years suggested efficacy for prevention of oral HPV infection.87 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination with 9 valent HPV vaccine for all 11- or 12-year-old girls and boys. The vaccine series can be started at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for all 13- to 26-year-old females and all 13- to 21-year-old males who have not been vaccinated. Catch-up vaccination is also recommended for males aged 22 to 26 years who are men who have sex with men (MSM), or have HIV infection or are otherwise immunocompromised. 88,89 The 9-valent vaccine should be delivered through a series of three intramuscular injections over a 6-month period. The second and third doses should be given at 1 to 2 months and then 6 months after the first dose. 88,89 Although ACIP recommends a 2-dose schedule for adolescents initiating the vaccine series at ages 9 to 14 years, 90 three doses of HPV vaccine (0, 1-2, and 6 months) are recommended for females and males with HIV infection or other immune suppression because their immune response to vaccination might be attenuated. One randomized, double-blind, clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in adults with HIV infection older than 27 years.87 The trial did not show efficacy for prevention of new anal HPV infections or improvement in anal HSIL outcomes in this population with high levels of prior and current HPV infection. This trial and several other studies have established the safety and immunogenicity of HPV vaccines 91,92 in a broad range of individuals with HIV infection.93 Some studies have demonstrated lower antibody levels in individuals with HIV infection than in those who do not have are HIV infection; however, the clinical significance of this observation is unknown. 94-96 Studies have shown that HPV vaccination induces an anamnestic response in children and adults with HIV infection.92,97,104 Immune responses appear stronger among those with higher CD4 counts and suppressed HIV viral loads.93,98,96 For patients who have completed a vaccination series with the recombinant bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, many experts would give additional full series of vaccination with recombinant 9-valent vaccine, but there are no data to define who might benefit or how cost effective this approach might be (CIII) . The additional five high-risk HPV types covered by the 9-valent vaccine were found in 4.2% to 18.3% of HPV-associated anogenital cancers depending on location in U.S. men and women. 65 HPV vaccination prevents initial HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV . Because some individuals with HIV infection have had many sex partners prior to vaccination, HPV vaccination may be less beneficial in these patients than in those with few or no lifetime sex partners. Given that HPV vaccination is safe and immunogenic, and because of its potential benefit in preventing HPV-associated disease and cancer in this population, HPV vaccination is recommended for males and females with HIV infection aged 13 through 26 years (AIII) . Current data do not support vaccination for those older than 26 years, and HPV vaccines are not approved for use in men or women older than 26 years. Women with HIV infection who have been vaccinated should also have routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not prevent all HPV types that may be precursors to cervical cancer, and because the vaccine may be less effective in women with HIV infection (especially those with low CD4 cell counts) than in women without HIV infection. Condom Use The use of male latex condoms is strongly recommended for preventing transmission or acquisition of Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-6HPV infection, as well as for preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (AII). Latex condoms provide a sufficient barrier to prevent passage of particles the size of HPV . Consistent and proper use of latex male condoms has been associated with 70% lower incidence of oncogenic HPV infection among women. 18 Similarly, recent cross-sectional data suggested that among heterosexual men, consistent condom use was associated with 50% lower odds of HPV infection of the penis. A meta-analysis found that condom use was associated with reduced risk of genital warts, and in women, with lower rates of CIN. 99 A RCT of condom use in heterosexual couples found significantly more frequent clearance of CIN and HPV among women randomized to condom use, and of penile lesions among their male partners. In women with HIV infection, several studies have observed lower rates of HPV detection associated with use of condoms. Male condoms have benefits in reducing risk of transmission of nearly all STDs (including HIV infection) during heterosexual intercourse and same-sex intercourse between men. In circumstances when a male condom cannot be used properly, a female condom (e.g., an FC1 or FC2 Female Condom \u00ae) should be considered for heterosexual vaginal intercourse (AII) and for heterosexual or male same-sex anal intercourse (BIII). Data on FC1 and FC2 Female Condoms suggest that the devices are protective against STDs. Male Circumcision Evidence is growing that male circumcision reduces rates of oncogenic HPV infection of the penis, based on data from RCTs 100-103 and observational studies. Observational studies in the general population also suggest that circumcision is associated with lower risk of penile cancer, and of cervical cancer in sexual partners. Relevant data in men who are HIV seropositive, however, are limited, and the findings to date suggest that, while protective, the effects of circumcision against HPV infection may be less in individuals with HIV infection than in those who are HIV seronegative. Furthermore, no clinical trials have assessed whether circumcision of men who are HIV seropositive reduces risk of genital or anal HPV-related cancer or precancer (such as AIN) or oncogenic HPV infection of the anal or oral mucosa for them or their sexual partners. Evidence is insufficient to recommend adult male circumcision solely to reduce the risk of oncogenic HPV infection in men with HIV infection, or their sex partners, in the United States. Preventing Disease Preventing Vaginal and Vulvar Cancer Following hysterectomy for benign disease, routine screening for vaginal cancer is not recommended for women who are HIV seropositive (AIII) . However, women with a history of high-grade CIN, adenocarcinoma in situ, or invasive cervical cancer are at increased risk and should be followed with an annual vaginal cuff Pap test (BIII). For patients not known to have had a hysterectomy for a benign indication, continue screening as for women with intact cervices as studies have shown that CIN is the most common indication for hysterectomy in women with HIV infection. Although vaginal Pap tests are often abnormal in women with HIV infection and more common than in women without HIV infection, V AIN 2+ and vaginal cancers are infrequent. 104 Another study by Smeltzer et al in women with HIV infection with previous hysterectomy and no previous abnormal Pap test, showed that among those with vaginal biopsies, 29% had V AIN 2 or V AIN 3. However, there were limitations to this study as the sample size was small, and it was a retrospective study. For patients with abnormal vaginal cuff Pap test results with no visible vaginal colposcopic abnormalities, the use of Lugol's iodine to stain the vagina is recommended (AIII) . Vaginal colposcopy also is indicated in the presence of concomitant cervical and vulvar lesions. Classification of V AIN parallels that of the cervix, that is, V AIN 1, V AIN 2, and V AIN 3. No screening procedure is available for vulvar cancer. However, biopsy or referral is indicated when inspection/palpation identifies lesions suspicious for VIN or cancer. Preventing Anal Cancer Some cost-effectiveness evaluations indicate that in patients who are HIV seropositive, screening for lesions using anal cytology and treating anal precancerous lesions to reduce risk of anal cancer in patients with HIV Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-7infection may provide clinical benefits comparable to measures to prevent other opportunistic infection. AIN lesions are similar in many ways to CIN, but there may be differences in natural history, optimal screening, and treatment approaches to prevent cancer. At this time, no national recommendations exist for routine screening for anal cancer. However, some specialists recommend anal cytologic screening or high resolution anoscopy for men and women who are HIV seropositive (CIII) . An annual digital anal examination may be useful to detect masses on palpation that could be anal cancer (BIII). Screening for anal cancer with anal cytology should not be done without the availability of referral for high resolution anoscopy. If anal cytology is performed and indicates ASC-US, high-resolution anoscopy (BIII). Visible lesions should be biopsied to determine the level of histologic changes and to rule out invasive cancer (BIII) (see section on treatment for details on treating AIN). Preventing Oropharyngeal Cancer While HPV DNA detection and HPV serology might be useful in identifying individuals at high risk of oropharyngeal cancer, there are currently no adequate methods to determine the site of HPV-associated oropharyngeal pre-cancer or cancer to target biopsy or treatment, despite ongoing efforts. It should also be noted that rates of non-HPV associated oral cancer are also increased in individuals with HIV infection, 67 and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) can be diagnosed in some cases; albeit, the effectiveness of this approach has not been tested in RCTs. 105 Treating Disease Preferred and Alternative Approaches for Treatment, Including Duration of Therapy Treating Genital and Oral Warts Patients with HIV infection may have larger or more numerous warts, may not respond as well to therapy for genital warts as individuals who are immunocompetent, and may have more frequent recurrences after treatment. Genital warts are not life-threatening, and they may regress without therapy, even in patients with HIV , especially when immunity is relatively preserved. Treatments are available for genital warts, but none are uniformly effective or uniformly preferred. Lacking RCTs specific to individuals with HIV infection, guidelines for the treatment of STDs in patients with HIV infection should be followed. More than one treatment option may be required for refractory or recurrent lesions in patients with HIV infection. Histologic diagnosis should be obtained for refractory lesions to confirm the absence of high-grade disease. Intra-anal, vaginal, or cervical warts should be treated and managed by a specialist. Patient-applied treatments are generally recommended for uncomplicated external warts that can be easily identified and treated by the patient. Imiquimod (5% cream) is a topical cytokine inducer that should be applied at bedtime on three non-consecutive nights per week, for up to 16 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible. The treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6 to 10 hours after the application (BII). Podofilox 0.5% solution or gel should be applied to visible anogenital warts twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary, up to four times (BIII). Another option is sinecatechins (15% ointment), a topical botanical product that contains active catechins from green tea and should be applied three times daily for up to 16 weeks, until warts are completely cleared and not visible (BIII). No clinical trials of this latter treatment option have been conducted in individuals with HIV infection.Provider-applied treatments such as cryotherapy, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), bichloroacetic acid (BCA), and surgery, are typically recommended for complex or multicentric lesions, lesions inaccessible to patient-applied therapy, or because of patient or provider preference. Cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe) destroys lesions by thermal-induced cytolysis and should be applied until each lesion is thoroughly frozen, with treatment repeated every 1 to 2 weeks for up to 4 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Some specialists recommend allowing the lesion to thaw and freezing a second time in each session (BIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-8TCA and BCA (80% to 90%) each act as caustic agents to destroy wart tissue and should be applied to warts only and allowed to dry until a white frosting develops. If an excess amount of acid is applied, the treated area should be powdered with talc, sodium bicarbonate, or liquid soap to remove unreacted acid. The treatment can be repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Surgical treatments (e.g., tangential scissor excision, tangential shave excision, curettage, electrosurgery, electrocautery, infrared coagulation) can be used for external genital and anal warts (BIII). Laser surgery is an option, but is usually more expensive (CIII) . Topical application of cidofovir has reported activity against genital warts (CIII) , but no topical formulation is commercially available. Intralesional interferon has been used for the treatment of genital warts but because of cost, difficulty of administration, and potential for systemic side effects such as fever, fatigue, myalgias, and leukopenia, it is not recommended for first-line treatment (CIII) . Podophyllin resin may be an alternative provider-applied treatment, with strict adherence to recommendations on application. It has inconsistent potency in topical preparations, and can have toxicity that may limit routine use in clinical practice. There is no consensus on optimal treatments of oral warts. Many treatments for anogenital warts cannot be used in the oral mucosa. Given the lack of RCTs, surgery is the most common treatment for oral warts that interfere with function or need to be removed for aesthetic reasons. Treating CIN and Cervical Cancer Women with HIV infection and CIN should be managed by a clinician with experience in colposcopy and treatment of cervical cancer precursors. In general, CIN in women with HIV infection should be managed according to ASCCP guidelines. Women with satisfactory colposcopy and biopsy-confirmed high-grade CIN can be treated with either (i.e., laser vaporization, electrocautery, diathermy, and cold coagulation) excisional methods (e.g., loop electrosurgical excision procedure, laser conization, cold knife conization), whereas women with unsatisfactory colposcopy should be treated only with excisional methods (AII). In patients with recurrent high-grade CIN, diagnostic excisional methods are recommended (AII). Hysterectomy is acceptable for treatment of recurrent or persistent biopsy-confirmed high-grade CIN (BII); if invasive disease is suspected, the patient should be managed in consultation with a gynecologic oncologist. For adolescents with HIV infection, the ASCCP guidelines for adolescents and young women should continue to be followed. In these patients, progression of lesions is more common, and so is recurrence. Therefore, close observation, as outlined in the guidelines, should be considered for management of CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN2,3 not otherwise specified, and histologic HSIL in HIV-infected adolescents and women younger than 25 years (BIII). If compliance is questionable, then it may be preferable to follow the treatment arm of management for CIN 2, CIN2,3, and HSIL (BIII). Management of invasive cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer should follow National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp ). Although complication and failure rates may be higher in women with HIV infection, standard treatment appears safe and efficacious. Treating VIN, Vulvar Cancer, V AIN, and Vaginal Cancer Low-grade VIN/V AIN (VIN/V AIN1) can be observed or managed as for vulvovaginal warts. Treatment of high-grade VIN/V AIN should be individualized in consultation with a specialist and is dependent upon the patient's medical condition and the location and extent of the disease. Various treatment modalities are available for VIN, including local excision, laser vaporization, ablation, and imiquimod therapy. Treatment options for V AIN include topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), laser vaporization with CO2 laser, and excisional procedures with electrosurgical loops or a scalpel excision. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-9Management of vulvar and vaginal cancer must be individualized in consultation with a specialist, following NCCN guidelines (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp ). Treating AIN and Anal Cancer For AIN2-3, no adequate RCTs have been reported, and data are insufficient to recommend a specific treatment approach. A RCT was recently initiated to determine if treatment of AIN2-3 reduces the incidence of anal cancer in patients with HIV infection. Definitive guidelines on anal screening and treatment in patients with HIV infection will likely follow from the results of this study. Until then, treatment decisions are based on assessment of the size and location of the lesion and its histologic grade. All treatment modalities are associated with high rates of recurrence. Topical treatment options including 5-FU, cidofovir, intra-anal imiquimod, and provider-applied TCA have demonstrated moderate efficacy for treatment of intra-anal AIN. Ablative therapies including infrared coagulation, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and electrocautery/hyfrecator are well tolerated. Repeated ablative treatment or a combination of treatment methods are often required for long-term clearance of AIN2-3. In a retrospective analysis, infrared coagulation was proven to have moderate efficacy in treatment of AIN-2 or 3 in patients who are HIV seropositive, 106 and it was safe and well tolerated in this population in a prospective AIDS Malignancy Consortium study. No indications exist for systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for patients with AIN in the absence of evidence of invasive cancer. The most commonly used treatment for anal cancer is combination radiation and chemotherapy. Treating HPV-Associated Disease at Other Sites, Including the Penis and the Mouth Penile and some oropharyngeal cancers are associated with HPV infection. Treatment options do not differ for men and women with and without HIV infection. Data suggest a more favorable prognosis for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers than for non-HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are treatment modalities used for oropharyngeal cancers. Special Considerations With Regard to Starting ART Given the strong evidence that early ART initiation is clinically beneficial in reducing risk of AIDS and opportunistic infections (OIs), there is no reason to consider HPV-related oral, anal, or genital disease when deciding whether or when to initiate ART. Monitoring Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Monitoring by physical examination is required during and after treatment of genital warts to detect toxicity, persistence, or recurrence, all of which are common with each of the treatments. Because recurrences of CIN and cervical cancer after conventional therapy are more common in patients who are HIV seropositive, they should be followed after treatment with frequent cytologic screening and colposcopic examination, according to published guidelines (AII) (see Preventing Disease and Treating sections). Treatment of CIN with ablative and excisional modalities can be associated with several adverse events, such as pain and discomfort, intraoperative hemorrhage, postoperative hemorrhage, infection, and cervical stenosis; individualized treatment of adverse events is required. Each of the treatment modalities for AIN described above is associated with adverse events, primarily pain, bleeding, ulceration, and in rare cases, development of abscesses, fissures, or fistulas. Patients can be monitored for adverse events using the methods previously described. Treatment for anal cancer with combination radiation and chemotherapy is associated with a high rate of morbidity, even when the treatment is successful. The most important complication is radiation-associated proctitis. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-10Managing Treatment Failure For persistent or recurrent genital warts, retreatment with any of the modalities previously described should be considered (AIII) . Biopsy should be considered to exclude VIN. Genital warts often require more than one course of treatment. Recurrent cytologic and histologic abnormalities after therapy for CIN should be managed according to ASCCP guidelines. There is no consensus on the treatment of biopsy-proven recurrent VIN and surgical excision can be considered. Preventing Recurrence Monitoring after therapy for cervical disease should follow ASCCP guidelines. In one study of women with HIV infection treated for high-grade CIN, low-dose intravaginal 5-FU (2 g twice weekly for 6 months) reduced the short-term risk of recurrence. Clinical experience with this therapy, however, is too limited to provide a recommendation for its use, and no follow-up study to confirm these observations has been reported. No guidelines exist regarding frequency of monitoring after therapy for VIN, but twice-yearly vulvar inspection appears reasonable for women who have been treated for VIN. Women who have been treated for high-grade V AIN should be managed like those with CIN 2, that is, with cytology at 6 and 12 months after therapy, and annually thereafter. No indication exists for secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) with any of the conventional modalities to prevent recurrence of genital warts, CIN, or AIN. Special Considerations During Pregnancy Pregnant women living with HIV infection who have genital warts or anogenital HPV-related neoplasia are best managed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists (such as an obstetrician/gynecologist and an infectious disease physician). Pregnancy may be associated with an increased frequency and rate of growth of genital warts. Podofilox should not be used during pregnancy (BIII). At present, the evidence is insufficient to recommend imiquimod use during pregnancy (CIII) . No anomalies have been observed with the use of imiquimod in animals during pregnancy. There have been several case series describing the use of imiquimod during pregnancy also without any significant adverse effects. Other topical treatments (such as BCA and TCA) and ablative therapies (i.e., laser, cryotherapy, and excision) can be used during pregnancy (AIII) . Transmission of genital HPV6 and 11 from vaginal secretions at delivery is the presumed mechanism of early-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in children. This condition is rare but is more common among children of women who have genital warts at delivery. Cesarean delivery is not known to prevent this condition in infants and children. 107 No change in obstetrical management is indicated for women with genital warts unless extensive condylomata are present that might impede vaginal delivery or cause extensive bleeding (AIII) . Pregnant women should undergo cervical cancer screening as recommended above for non-pregnant women. Cytobrush sampling can be done during pregnancy. Pregnant women with abnormal cervical cytology results should undergo colposcopy and cervical biopsy of lesions suspicious for high-grade disease or cancer (BIII). Increased bleeding may occur with cervical biopsy during pregnancy. Endocervical curettage is contraindicated in pregnant women (AIII) . Pregnant women with ASC-US can be managed the same as non-pregnant women, although deferral of colposcopy until at least 6 weeks postpartum is recommended (CIII) . Treatment of CIN is not recommended during pregnancy unless invasive disease is suspected. Pregnant women with suspected cervical cancer should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for definitive diagnosis, treatment, and development of a delivery plan. Vaginal delivery is not recommended for women with invasive cervical cancer. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-11For women with CIN and without suspicion of invasive disease, re-evaluation with cytology and colposcopy is recommended after 6 weeks postpartum. Women with CIN can deliver vaginally. An analysis of the Danish Medical Birth Register and National Patient Register found that among 1665 exposed pregnancies, quadrivalent HPV vaccination was not associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. 108 At present, vaccination with commercially available HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII) . However, in a combined analysis of five RCTs of the HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine, administration of the vaccine to women who became pregnant during the course of the trial did not appear to negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. 109 The effects of treatment of AIN on pregnancy are unknown. Most experts recommend deferral of diagnosis and treatment of AIN until after delivery unless a strong clinical suspicion of anal cancer exists. Women with HIV Infection Aged <30 Years: If younger than 21 years, known to have HIV infection or newly diagnosed HIV infection, and sexually active, screen within 1 ye ar of onset of sexual activity regardless of mode of HIV infection. Women with HIV infection aged 21 to 29 years should have a Pap test following initial diagnosis of HIV. Pap test should be done at baseline and every 12 months (BII). Some experts recommend a Pap test at 6 months after the baseline test (CIII) If results of 3 consecutive Pap tests are normal, follow-up Pap tests can be performed every 3 years (BII) Co-testing (Pap test and HPV test) is not recommended for women younger than 30 years. Women with HIV Infection Aged 30 Years Pap Testing Only: Pap test should be done at baseline and ever y 12 months (BII). Some experts recommend a Pap test at 6 months after the baseline test (CIII). If results of 3 consecutive Pap tests are normal, follow-up Pap tests can be per formed every 3 years (BII). Or: Pap Test and HPV Co-Testing: Pap test and HPV co-testing should be done at baseline (BII). If result of the Pap test is normal and HPV co-testing is negative, follow up Pap test and HPV co-testing can be per formed every 3 years (BII). If the result of the Pap test is normal but HPV co-testing is positive: Either: Follow-up test with Pap test and HPV co-testing should be per formed in 1 year. If the 1-year follow-up Pap test is abnormal or HPV co-testing is positive, referral to colposcopy is recommended. Or: Per form HPV genotyping. If positive for HPV -16 or HPV-18, colposcopy is recommended If negative for HPV -16 and HPV-18, repeat co-test in 1 year is recommended. If the follow-up HPV test is positive or Pap test is abnormal, colposcopy is recommended. Or:Pap Test and HPV 16 or HPV 16/18 Specified in Co-Testing: Pap test and HPV 16 or 16/18 co-testing should be done at baseline (BII). If result of the Pap test is normal, and HPV 16 or 16/18 co-testing is negative, follow-up Pap test and HPV co-testing can be per formed every 3 years (BII). If initial test or follow-up test is positive for HPV 16 or 16/18, referral to colposcopy is recommended (BII).Recommendations for Cervical Cancer Screening for Women with HIV Infection Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Q-12Preventing First Episode of HPV Infection Indications for HPV Vaccination: HIV -infected; aged 13 to 26 years (AIII) Note: Please refer to Pediatric OI Guidelines for vaccination of boys and girls younger than age 13 years.Vaccination SchedulesHPV recombinant vaccine 9 valent (Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) 0.5 mL IM at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII) For patients who have completed a vaccination series with the recombinant bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, many experts would give additional full series of vaccination with recombinant 9-valent vaccine, but there are no data to define who might benefit or how cost effective this approach might be (CIII) Treating Condyloma Acuminatum (Genital Warts) Note: Patients with HIV infection may have larger or more numerous warts, may not respond as well to therapy for genital warts, and have a higher risk of recurrence after treatment than individuals who are HIV negative. More than one treatment option maybe required for refractory or recurrent lesions. Intra-anal, vaginal, or cervical warts should be treated and managed by a specialist. Patient-Applied TherapyFor Uncomplicated External Warts that can be Easily Identified and Treated by the Patient: Imiquimod 5% cream: Apply to lesions at bedtime on 3 non-consecutive nights a week, and wash the treatment area with soap and water 6 to 10 hours after application (BII), repeating the cycle until lesions are no longer seen, for up to 16 weeks, or Sinecatechins 15% ointment: Apply to area 3 times daily for up to 16 weeks, until warts are not visible (BIII). Provider-Applied Therapy For Complex or Multicentric Lesions, Lesions Inaccessible to Patient-Applied Treatments, or Patient/Provider Preference: Cr yotherapy (liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe): Apply until each lesion is thoroughly frozen; repeat every 1 to 2 weeks for up to 4 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Some specialists allow the lesion to thaw, and then freeze a second time in each session (BIII). TCA or BCA cauterization: 80% to 90% aqueous solution, apply to warts only and allow the area to dr y until a white frost develops. If an excess amount of acid is applied, the treated area should be powdered with talc, sodium bicarbonate, or liquid soap to remove unreacted acid. Repeat treatment weekly for up to 6 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Surgical excision (BIII) or laser surgery (CIII) can be performed for external or anal warts.Recommendations for Preventing Human Papillomavirus Infections Key bichloroacetic acid; HPV human papillomavirus; intramuscular; OI = opportunistic infection; TCA = trichloroacetic acid References 1.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV R-1Leishmaniasis (Last updated February 6, 2017; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoa that survive and replicate inside vacuoles within macrophages and other mononuclear cells. The Leishmania genus has traditionally been differentiated into multiple species that cause cutaneous, mucosal, and/or visceral disease.1,2 Leishmaniasis occurs in 98 countries or territories in the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe, with an estimated incidence of 1.6 million new cases annually\u2014as many as 1.2 million cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 0.4 million cases of visceral leishmaniasis. 3 As of March 2010, HIV-leishmaniasis co- infection has been reported in 35 countries, predominantly as visceral leishmaniasis.3,4 The first cases of HIV-leishmaniasis co-infection were described in Spain in the late 1980s. During the 1980s and 1990s, more than 90% of co-infection cases were reported in southern Europe. 3,5 After the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence decreased substantially in developed countries,6,7 but HIV- leishmaniasis co-infection poses a growing problem in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.3,4,8,9 In one large leishmaniasis specialty hospital in Bihar, India, the prevalence of HIV infection in patients with visceral leishmaniasis has increased from 0.88% in 2000 to 2.18% in 2006. 3 A study in a treatment center in Humera in northwestern Ethiopia reported that 31% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis were co-infected with HIV . 10 Most leishmanial infections in immunocompetent hosts are asymptomatic. In many disease-endemic areas, 30% or more of the population has evidence of latent infection, as demonstrated by a positive leishmanin skin test. 11-13 After primary infection, Leishmania remain viable in healthy individuals for long periods, creating a population at risk of reactivation if immunosuppression occurs. In HIV-infected patients without severe immunosuppression, disease manifestations are similar to those in immunocompetent individuals. In those with advanced immunosuppression (i.e., CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] cell count <200 cells/mm 3), manifestations of leishmaniasis can be both atypical and more severe. Relapse after treatment\u2014 especially of visceral leishmaniasis\u2014is common.14,15 In endemic areas, leishmaniasis is usually spread by infected sand flies of the genera Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia.2 However, in Southern Europe, HIV and Leishmania infantum visceral co-infections were reported in association with injection-drug use, suggesting that Leishmania which can be transmitted via blood transfusion, also may be acquired by needle sharing.16 Leishmania parasites were demonstrated in 34% to 52% of used syringes discarded by injection-drug users in Madrid, and, based on molecular characteristics, investigators have described a new, epidemiologically significant leishmaniasis transmission cycle that relies on mechanical transfer of amastigotes via contaminated syringes. 17,18 Clinical Manifestations The term leishmaniasis encompasses multiple syndromes\u2014most notably, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, The most common clinical presentation of leishmaniasis in HIV-infected individuals is a systemic visceral disease syndrome, but the distribution varies geographically, reflecting differences in the predominant parasite species. In Europe, visceral disease has been reported in 95% of cases (87% typical visceral, forms have accounted for 43%, 37%, and 20% of reported cases, respectively.19 In patients with HIV and visceral disease, the most common clinical and laboratory findings are fever (65% to 100%), systemic malaise (70% to with <10 g is usually to 93%). Splenomegaly is less pronounced in HIV-co-infected patients than in immunocompetent Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV R-2patients with visceral leishmaniasis.15 In patients with more profound immunosuppression, atypical manifestations have been described, including involvement of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, lung, pleural and peritoneal cavities, and skin.4-6,15,20 Esophageal involvement can lead to dysphagia and odynophagia, and must be distinguished from other causes of esophagitis in HIV-infected patients, such as candidiasis. However, the presence of Leishmania amastigotes in skin can occur in the absence of lesions or in combination with other pathology, such as KS, and does not prove that the parasite is the cause of the lesions. 24,25 Disfiguring mucosal lesions associated with anergy to Leishmania antigens have been observed in Europeans with AIDS, in contrast to mucocutaneous disease in immunocompetent patients, which is associated with strong leishmanin skin-test responses. 20,26,27 Diagnosis Demonstration of Leishmania parasites by histopathology, cultures, and smears in tissue specimens (such as scrapings, aspirates, and biopsies) is the standard for diagnosing cutaneous leishmaniasis in HIV-co-infected patients. 4,5 Visceral leishmaniasis also can be diagnosed by demonstration of leishmanial parasites in blood smears (approximately 50% sensitivity in expert hands), buffy-coat smear preparations, cultures from the peripheral blood, and smears or cultures from bone marrow or splenic aspirates. PCR amplification can also be useful for detecting Leishmania nucleic acid in the blood or tissue of co-infected patients (>95% sensitivity). 18 Serologic tests to detect Leishmania antbodies are highly sensitivity and can be used to diagnose visceral leishmaniasis in immunocompetent patients.28 Serology should not be used as a screening test as positive serology can occur in individuals with asymptomatic infection. It should be used only as a confirmatory test in patients with a compatible clinical picture and an exposure history suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis. Serology has a low sensitivity in HIV-infected patients, especially in Europe, such that parasitological diagnosis should be sought when clinical suspicion has been raised. 4,5,29 The use of recombinant antigen in ELISA assays may increase sensitivity, but a proportion of co-infected patients remain seronegative. 30 Immunoblotting with Leishmania infantum soluble antigen has been successful in detecting specific antileishmanial antibodies in up to 70% of European patients.29 Interestingly, reports suggest that the serology sensitivity may remain fairly high in HIV-co-infected patients in Ethiopia (77%-89% in HIV-visceral leishmaniasis co-infected patients, versus 87%-95% in HIV-negative patients). 31 Leishmanial skin tests are nearly always negative in active visceral leishmaniasis, with or without HIV co-infection.2 Preventing Exposure Prevention of exposure to leishmanial infection relies on reservoir host control in areas with zoonotic transmission and vector control activities, such as indoor residual spraying and/or use of insecticide-treated bed nets. The best way for travelers to leishmaniasis-endemic areas to prevent infection is to protect themselves from sand fly bites. Personal protective measures include minimizing nocturnal outdoor activities, wearing protective clothing, and applying insect repellent to exposed skin. Measures to decrease transmission of infectious agents, including Leishmania parasites, in injection-drug users, such as the use of clean needles and injection works from syringe (needle) exchange programs, are appropriate. Preventing Disease Primary chemoprophylaxis to prevent leishmaniasis is not recommended, and no screening or preemptive therapy is appropriate for HIV-infected patients who may have been exposed to leishmanial infection. No Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV R-3vaccine against leishmaniasis is available. Treating Disease Visceral Leishmaniasis For HIV-infected patients with visceral leishmaniasis, conventional and lipid formulations of amphotericin B appear to be at least as effective as pentavalent antimonials.4,32-35 Liposomal and lipid complex preparations of amphotericin B are typically better tolerated than conventional amphotericin B (amphotericin B deoxycholate) or pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate). 36-38 The equivalent efficacy and better toxicity profile have led most clinicians to regard liposomal amphotericin B as the drug of choice for visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-co-infected patients (AII). 4,39 The optimal amphotericin B dosage has not been determined.39,40 Regimens with efficacy include liposomal preparations of 2 to 4 mg/kg body weight administered on consecutive days or in an interrupted schedule (e.g., 4 mg/kg on days 1-5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38) to achieve a total cumulative dose of 20 to 60 mg/kg body weight (AII), or amphotericin B deoxycholate, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg body weight/day intravenously (IV), to achieve a total dose of 1.5 to 2.0 g (BII). 32,35,39,41-43 Pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate), which is available in the United States through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 20 mg/kg/day IV or intramuscular (IM) for 28 consecutive days, may be considered as an alternative (BII). Additional treatment options for visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-co-infected patients, which are recommended primarily because of their use in non-HIV-infected patients. include oral miltefosine, which is available in the United States via www.Profounda.com, and the parenteral formulation of the aminoglycoside paromomycin, which is not available in the United States. 40,44 In general, the target dose of miltefosine is ~2.5 mg/kg daily (maximum of 150 mg daily), and the initial treatment course is 28 days. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common but typically do not limit treatment. Data supporting the use of miltefosine in HIV-co-infected patients are relatively limited (CIII) . 45,46 paromomycin been used successfully visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-negative patients, particularly in India.40 Essentially no efficacy data are available for paromomycin in HIV-co-infected patients. A clinical trial of combination therapy (liposomal amphotericin B plus miltefosine or paromomycin; miltefosine plus paromomycin) produced promising results in non-HIV-infected patients in India whose visceral leishmaniasis was not severe. 47 Further research is needed to validate the efficacy of drug combinations, including for severe or refractory cases of visceral leishmaniasis in various geographic regions and in HIV-co-infected patients. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Few systematic data are available on the efficacy of treatment for cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis in HIV-co-infected patients. On the basis of data in HIV-negative patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and case reports in HIV-co-infected patients, HIV-infected patients should be treated with liposomal amphotericin B (BIII) as previously outlined, 48 or pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate), depending on the form of the disease and the clinical response (BIII).2,49,50 However, pentavalent antimony can increase viral transcription and HIV replication in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, raising concerns about its use in HIV-infected patients. 51 Potential alternatives for cutaneous leishmaniasis include miltefosine, topical paromomycin, intralesional pentavalent antimony, and local heat therapy. However, no data exist for co-infected patients, and in immunocompetent patients, the effectiveness of these modalities is known to be dependent upon the infecting species of Leishmania. 40,52-54 Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART ART should be initiated or optimized following standard practice for HIV-infected patients (AIII) . There are no leishmaniasis-specific data on when to start ART. Appropriate use of ART has substantially improved the survival of co-infected patients in Europe and decreased the likelihood of relapse after antileishmanial Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV R-4therapy.7,15,55 Therefore, ART should be started as soon as patients are able to tolerate it (AIII) . Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Patients treated with liposomal amphotericin B should be monitored for dose-dependent nephrotoxicity, electrolyte disturbances, and infusion-related adverse reactions (AII). events are ameliorated by pretreatment with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, or limited doses of corticosteroids (BII). Infusion of 1 L of saline one hour prior to drug infusion can help reduce the risk of glomerular function decline during treatment (BIII). The frequency of nephrotoxicity is lower for liposomal or lipid-associated preparations than for amphotericin B deoxycholate. 37 Amphotericin B deoxycholate treatment is also associated with an increased risk of anemia.33 Patients receiving pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate) should be monitored closely for adverse reactions. 49 Overall, at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight per day, greater than 60% of patients have 1 or more of the following reactions: thrombophlebitis, anorexia, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, elevation of liver transaminases, amylase or lipase, and (in some patients) clinical pancreatitis. Weekly electrocardiograms are recommended during treatment, with careful monitoring for changes that may indicate early cardiotoxicity, such as prolonged QT intervals and T-wave inversion (CIII) . Rarely, arrhythmias and sudden death have 33,41 Severe adverse reactions to pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate), including acute pancreatitis and leukopenia, appear to be more common in co-infected patients than in those who are not infected with HIV . 56 Cases of newly symptomatic visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported in association with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) following initiation of ART. 57,58 Several of these cases have resembled post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis or disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis.59-62 Existing experience with IRIS-associated leishmaniasis, however, is insufficient to provide data for specific management guidelines. Managing Treatment Failure For patients who fail to respond to initial therapy or who experience a relapse after initial treatment, a repeat course of the initial regimen, or one of the recommended alternatives for initial therapy, should be used as previously outlined (AIII) . The response rate for retreatment appears to be similar to that for initial therapy, although some patients evolve to a chronic disease state with serial relapses despite aggressive acute and maintenance therapies. Immunotherapy, including interferon-gamma and recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), has been used experimentally as an adjunct to antileishmanial treatment for refractory cases. 63,64 However, a clinical trial pentavalent stibogluconate) plus interferon-gamma for visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-co-infected patients was suspended when an interim analysis indicated that there was no advantage over pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate) alone. 41 In addition, the use of interferon-gamma was reported to be associated with acceleration of KS in two patients with visceral leishmaniasis and HIV co-infection. 24 Preventing Recurrence Relapses, particularly of visceral leishmaniasis and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis, are common after cessation of antileishmanial therapy in HIV-infected patients, and frequency of relapse is inversely related to CD4 cell count. In HIV-co-infected patients with visceral leishmaniasis who were not receiving or responding to ART, the risk of relapse at 6 and 12 months was 60% and 90%, respectively, in the absence of secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy). 5,65 Therefore, secondary prophylaxis with an effective antileishmanial drug, administered at least every 2 to 4 weeks, is recommended, particularly for patients with visceral leishmaniasis and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/\u00b5L (AII). 5,15,34,65 only published, randomized trial of secondary prophylaxis compared amphotericin B lipid complex Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV R-5(3 mg/kg every 21 days) in 8 patients to no prophylaxis in 9 patients; this trial reported relapse rates of 50% versus 78%, respectively, after 1 year of follow-up.34 In retrospective observational studies, monthly pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate) or lipid formulations of amphotericin every 2 to 4 weeks were also associated with decreased relapse rates. 15,65 Liposomal amphotericin B (4 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks) or amphotericin B lipid complex (3 mg/kg every 21 days) should be used for secondary prophylaxis (AII). Pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate), 20 mg/kg IV or IM every 4 weeks, is an alternative (BII). Although pentamidine is no longer recommended to treat primary visceral leishmaniasis, a dosage of 6 mg/kg IV every 2 to 4 weeks has been suggested as another alternative for secondary prophylaxis (CIII) . 66 Allopurinol, used for maintenance therapy in a dose of 300 mg orally 3 times daily, is less effective than monthly pentavalent antimony and is not recommended (BII). 65 Although no published data on efficacy are available, maintenance therapy may be indicated for immunocompromised patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis who have multiple relapses after adequate treatment (CIII) . When to Stop Secondary Prophylaxis Some investigators suggest that secondary antileishmanial prophylaxis can be discontinued in patients whose CD4 count is >200 to 350 cells/mm 3 in response to ART.67 Others, however, suggest that secondary prophylaxis should be maintained indefinitely. In one study, a positive peripheral blood PCR for Leishmania correlated with a high risk of relapse.68 Thus, because there is a paucity of published data or clinical trial experience, no recommendation can be made regarding discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis in HIV-Leishmania-co-infected persons. Special Considerations During Pregnancy Diagnostic considerations are the same in pregnant women as in women who are not pregnant. One study suggests that lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis may be larger and are more likely to be exophytic in pregnancy, and that untreated cutaneous leishmaniasis may be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and stillbirth. 69 Labels for pentavalent antimony compounds (sodium stibogluconate, available in the United States through CDC, and meglumine antimoniate) state that these drugs are contraindicated for use in pregnant women, although various antimonial compounds were not teratogenic in chickens, rats, or sheep. 70-72 Good clinical and pregnancy outcomes have been reported for small series of pregnant women treated with meglumine antimoniate, amphotericin B deoxycholate, or liposomal amphotericin B.73-76 Retrospective analyses suggest that rates of preterm birth and spontaneous abortion may be increased in women with visceral leishmaniasis during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester and when antimonial drugs are used. 77,78 Because visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially lethal disease, postponing treatment until after delivery is not an option. Liposomal amphotericin B is the first choice for therapy of visceral leishmaniasis in pregnancy because of concerns about toxicity and lack of experience with use of pentavalent antimony compounds in human pregnancy (AIII) . 74 antimony (sodium stibogluconate) (AIII) are available on the use of parenteral paromomycin in pregnancy, but concerns have been raised about fetal ototoxicity with other aminoglycosides used in pregnancy. Miltefosine is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy. 40 Perinatal transmission of Leishmania spp. is rare; 13 documented cases have been reported.77,79-81 No data are available on the risk of transmission of Leishmania spp. in HIV-infected pregnant women. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV R-6Recommendations for Treating Visceral or Liposomal amphotericin B interrupted schedule (e.g., 4 mg/kg on days 1-5, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38) (AII) Achieve a total dose of 20-60 mg/kg (AII) Alternative Therapy: Other amphotericin B lipid as above, or Amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.5-1.0 mg/kg IV daily for total dose of 1.5-2.0 grams (BII), or Pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate) 20 mg/kg IV or IM daily for 28 days (BII). (Contact the CDC Drug Service at 404- 639-3670 or drugservice@cdc.gov; for emergencies, call 770-488-7100.) Miltefosine (CIII) (available in the United States via www.Profounda.com) For patients who weigh 30-44 kg: 50 mg PO bid for 28 days For patients who weigh 45 kg: 50 mg PO tid for 28 days Chronic Maintenance Therapy for Visceral Leishmaniasis Indication: For patients with visceral 4 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks (AII), or Amphotericin B Lipid Complex 3 mg/kg every 21 days (AII) Alternative Therapy: Pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate) 20 mg/kg IV or IM every 4 weeks (BII) Discontinuation of Chronic Maintenance Therapy Some investigators suggest that therapy can be discontinued after a sustained (>3 to 6 months) increase in CD4 count to >200 to 350 cells/mm 3 in response to ART, but others suggest that therapy should be continued indefinitely. Therefore, no recommendation can be made regarding discontinuation of chronic maintenance therapy. Treating Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Preferred Therapy: Liposomal amphotericin B 2-4 mg/kg IV daily for 10 days or interrupted schedule (e.g., 4 mg/kg on days 1-5, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38) to achieve total dose of 20-60 mg/kg (BIII), or Pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate) 20 mg/kg or IM daily for 28 days (BIII) Alternative Therapy: Other options include oral miltefosine (can be obtained in the United States through a treatment IND), topical paromomycin, intralesional pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate), or local heat therapy .

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV S-1Malaria (Last updated March 28, 2017; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Malaria continues to contribute disproportionately to the global burden of infectious diseases, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2015, the World Health Organization estimated that 97 countries had ongoing malaria transmission, and almost half the world's population, approximately 3.2 billion people, lived in areas with some risk of malaria transmission. 1 Of the nearly 214 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2015 (based on reports and models), approximately 88% (188 million) occurred in Africa, the area of the world with the highest HIV prevalence. 1 Approximately 438,000 deaths were attributable to malaria in 2015, with ~90% occurring in Africa and 74% of those deaths in children younger than 5 years of age. Fifteen countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, account for 80% of malaria cases and 78% of deaths worldwide. 1 Current attributable morbidity and mortality are likely underestimated, given our limited understanding, surveillance, and reporting of non-falciparum infections. Malaria typically is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles sp. mosquito. Reports of vertical transmission and infection after blood transfusion do exist, but these routes of transmission are uncommon in non-endemic areas. 2-5 Malaria in humans can be caused by any one of five species: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax , Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium species that infects macaques in Southeast Asia).5 Although P . vivax infections are more common and occur in a far wider geographic distribution,6 P . falciparum malaria represents the most serious public health problem because of its tendency toward severe or fatal infections. P . vivax , however, should not be discounted as a risk for travelers in many parts of the world. Malaria and HIV both cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Given this substantial overlap, even modest interactions between them have public health importance.7,8 Malaria influences the natural history of HIV infection, and HIV infection alters the natural history and severity of malaria.9 Many foreign-born individuals develop malaria in the United States because of distant exposure before their arrival, or as a result of more recent travel for business or family reasons. Similarly, U.S.-born individuals can develop malaria during travel to endemic areas. 10-13 Failure to take appropriate chemoprophylaxis is a common problem for both groups of individuals.14,15 People who formerly lived in malarious areas may believe that they are immune, and therefore do not need to take prophylaxis.16 Such patients are at high risk of infection, however, because they likely have lost partial immunity within 6 months after leaving endemic regions. Consideration of malaria in returning travelers who are febrile is important: Of the nearly 50 million individuals who travel to developing countries each year, between 5% and 11% develop a fever during or after travel. 17-20 Malaria is a surprisingly common cause of these fevers.21 Clinical Manifestations The clinical syndromes caused by Plasmodium species depend on prior exposure.22 While many native U.S. travelers have no prior immunity, clinical manifestations in those who have resided in malarious areas depend on whether they lived in an area with stable endemic malaria transmission (year round) or unstable (seasonal, infrequent or very low) transmission. 23 In stable endemic areas, children younger than age 5 years may experience chronic infections with recurrent parasitemia, resulting in severe anemia and death. Children who survive these infections usually acquire partial immunity by age 5 years, and if they remain in the area where malaria is endemic, they maintain this immunity into adulthood. In stable endemic areas, adults usually experience asymptomatic or milder Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV S-2infections as a result of this acquired immune response. However, as noted previously, patients who leave endemic areas and subsequently return may be at high risk of disease because they likely have lost partial immunity 6 months after leaving endemic regions. In unstable transmission areas, protective immunity is not acquired. For populations in these areas, the overwhelming clinical manifestation is acute febrile disease that can be complicated by cerebral malaria, affecting persons of all ages. When pregnant women in areas of unstable transmission develop acute malaria, the consequences may include spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. In more stable transmission areas, pregnant women, particularly primigravidas, may lose some acquired immunity. Although infections may continue to be asymptomatic, infected pregnant women may acquire placental malaria that contributes to intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, and increased infant mortality. Patients with malaria can exhibit various symptoms and a broad spectrum of severity, depending upon factors such as the infecting species and level of acquired immunity in the host. HIV-immunosuppressed patients in endemic areas may lose acquired malarial immunity, and HIV-immunosuppressed adults with little or no previous malaria exposure (such as travelers) appear to be at increased risk of severe outcomes. 24 The incubation period for P . falciparum is from a week to several months, but most often less than 60 days. Patients can present much later (>1 year), but this pattern is more common with other species, especially P . vivax. In non-immune patients, typical symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, myalgias and arthralgias, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and other non-specific signs. Splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary or renal dysfunction, and neurologic findings also may be present. Classically, paroxysmal fevers occur every 48 hours for P P . vivax, with P . malariae occur every 72 hours. This classic presentation is highly variable, however, and may not be present. P . knowlesi, known to cause human infection in Southeast Asia in travelers to jungle/forested areas, is clinically indistinguishable from other species of malaria, and the overwhelming majority of patients present with uncomplicated disease (~90%). 25 Uncomplicated malaria infection can progress to severe disease or death within hours. Malaria with central nervous system symptoms can be particularly ominous. Cerebral malaria refers to unarousable coma not attributable to any other cause in patients infected with P . falciparum; in Africa, case fatality rates with cerebral malaria approach 40%. 26-28 The risk of severe and complicated illness is increased in patients with high levels of parasitemia and without partial immunity. Metabolic acidosis is an important manifestation of severe malaria and an indicator of poor prognosis. 29 Other acute complications include renal failure, hypoglycemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and acute pulmonary edema.30 P . falciparum is the species most commonly responsible for severe disease and death, although the other species can cause severe disease and death as well. 25,31 Effect of HIV on Parasitemia and Clinical Severity HIV infection impairs acquired immunity to malaria that is present in older children and adults in stable endemic areas. Large cohort studies have demonstrated the increased frequency (with rates one- to two-fold higher) of both parasitemia and clinical malaria in HIV-infected adults, with increasing risk and higher-density parasitemia associated with more advanced immunosuppression, particularly among CD4 T-lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <350 cells/mm 3.32-34 Increased rates of malaria among individuals with HIV do not appear to be as great as the rates observed with classic opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 35 In a prospective cohort study in an area with unstable malaria transmission, HIV-infected non-immune adults were found to be at increased risk of severe malaria, and the risk was associated with a low CD4 cell count. 36 Non-immune HIV-infected patients were substantially more likely to have severe clinical malaria than were non-immune patients without HIV . In KwaZulu Natal, an area of unstable malaria transmission, HIV-infected adults hospitalized for malaria were substantially more likely to die or require an intensive care unit admission Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV S-3than those who were not HIV-infected.37 In contrast, HIV infection did not confer an increased risk of poor outcomes among partially immune adults in areas with more stable transmission.32 In a cross-sectional study of travelers returning to France from malaria-endemic areas between 2000 and 2003, HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts <350 cells/mm3 were at significantly higher risk of developing severe malaria, compared with those who were HIV-negative.34 Effects of Malaria on Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission Placental malaria also has been associated with increased expression of CCR5 receptors in placental macrophages38 and increased viral load, 39 raising the possibility of placental malaria leading to increased mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV . In addition, fetal immune activation by malaria antigens may increase susceptibility to HIV infection. 40 Data are conflicting concerning the effect of malaria during pregnancy on risk of MTCT in the pre-ART era and are limited since the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for prevention of MTCT. 41-43 Diagnosis A malaria diagnosis must be considered in all febrile patients who have traveled to or lived in malaria-endemic areas or who have received blood products, tissues, or organs from individuals who have been to such areas. Several diagnostic methods are available, including microscopic diagnosis, antigen detection tests, polymerase chain reaction-based assays, and serologic tests, though serologic tests which detect host antibody are inappropriate for the diagnosis of acute malaria. Direct microscopic examination of intracellular parasites on stained blood films is the standard for definitive diagnosis in nearly all settings because it allows for identification of the species and provides a measure of parasite density. Microscopic diagnosis of P . knowlesi is difficult because it is commonly misidentified as P. malariae, which tends to follow a more benign course. Providers should have a high index of suspicion for P. knowlesi in travelers returning from Southeast Asia. 31 In non-immune patients with all types of malaria, symptoms may develop before detectable levels of parasitemia are evident. For this reason, several blood smear examinations taken at 12- to 24-hour intervals may be needed to positively rule out a diagnosis of malaria in symptomatic patients. Guidelines for laboratory diagnosis are summarized elsewhere and are available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s malaria website ( https://www.cdc.gov/malaria ). Rapid diagnostic tests, particularly for the diagnosis of P . falciparum, can be used depending on the local expertise and practice and can facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment of infected patients, but must be followed by microscopy. Preventing Exposure Pre-travel evaluation by a travel medicine specialist can provide specific education about risk of exposure in various geographic locales, the utility of insecticide-impregnated bed nets in the setting where the individual will be traveling or residing, and the use of DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methyl-benzamide)-containing repellants. Infection with P . falciparum can be more severe in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts and in pregnant women regardless of HIV infection than in other individuals. Because no chemoprophylactic regimen is completely effective, HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts and women who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant should be advised to avoid travel to areas with malaria transmission if possible (AIII). If travel to an endemic area cannot be deferred, use of an effective chemoprophylaxis regimen is essential, along with careful attention to personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. Preventing Disease For United States travelers (including HIV-infected patients) to endemic areas, a combination of Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV S-4chemoprophylaxis and personal protective measures can be highly effective in preventing malaria. Recommendations for prophylaxis are the same for HIV-infected patients as for those who are not HIV-infected and are available at CDC's malaria website (AIII) (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria ). Malaria incidence has been markedly reduced in African adults with HIV who receive cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) prophylaxis. 44 A recent study of HIV-infected patients in Uganda demonstrated that malaria burden was reduced by 70% with cotrimoxazole, and then reduced another 50% when antiretroviral (ARV) drugs were provided, and finally reduced another 50% with provision of insecticide-treated nets. 45 However, cotrimoxazole is not as effective an antimalarial prophylactic regimen as the recommended antimalarials. Therefore, HIV-infected travelers should not rely on prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole for chemoprophylaxis against malaria (AIII) . Treating Disease Because P . falciparum malaria can progress within hours from mild symptoms or low-grade fever to severe disease or death, all HIV-infected patients with confirmed or suspected P . falciparum infections should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to treatment (AIII) . Diagnosis prior to treatment should always be pursued; however, treatment should not be delayed when malaria is strongly suspected but laboratory services are unavailable or results will be delayed (AIII) . Choice of treatment is guided by the degree of parasitemia, the species of Plasmodium, a patient's clinical status, and the likely drug susceptibility of the infecting species (as determined by where the infection was acquired). For HIV-infected patients who do acquire Plasmodium infection, treatment recommendations are the same as for HIV-uninfected patients (AIII) . CDC posts current treatment recommendations on its website ( https:// www.cdc.gov/malaria ) and has clinicians on call 24 hours to provide advice to clinicians on diagnosing and treating malaria (CDC Malaria Hotline: (770) 488-7788; Monday through Friday. 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EST. (770) 488-7100 after hours). Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART There is no reason to defer ART initiation after patients have recovered from acute malaria. Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Careful monitoring of patients (especially those with P . falciparum malaria) is necessary, including measurement of peripheral parasitemia and hemoglobin and blood glucose levels, as well as assessment of cerebral, pulmonary, and renal function. Frequency of monitoring depends on severity of disease, a patient's immune status, and the species of Plasmodium. Chemoprophylaxis or treatment for malaria in patients receiving ARV agents requires attention to potential drug interactions. Several potential drug interactions can occur between antimalarial and HIV drugs as well as other medications used to treat HIV-associated opportunistic infections (see Table 5 ). 46 Providers are also encouraged to check for drug-drug interactions by using an interactive web-based resource from the University of Liverpool at http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org . Mefloquine in repeated doses has been observed to reduce area under the concentration-time curve and maximal plasma concentrations of ritonavir by 31% and 36%, respectively. Insufficient data are available to suggest that dose adjustments are needed. Quinine levels may be increased by ritonavir-containing regimens or cobicistat; conversely, nevirapine and efavirenz can reduce plasma quinine levels. Potential interactions can occur between ritonavir or cobicistat and chloroquine, but their clinical significance is unclear, and until further data are available, no dose adjustments are recommended. Artemether-lumefantrine is now approved in the United States for treatment of uncomplicated P . falciparum infection. Data in children suggest that this combination is well tolerated and safe in HIV-infected children, 47 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV S-5however, efficacy data are conflicting in HIV-infected adults. An open-label trial in Tanzania demonstrated excellent efficacy (97.6%) of artemether-lumefantrine for treating uncomplicated P . falciparum malaria in HIV-infected adults on nevirapine-based ART.48 Conversely, clinical and parasitologic response was sub-optimal in the efavirenz-based ART group, with efficacy of 82.5%, and a 19-fold increased risk of recurrent parasitemia compared to the control group of HIV-infected adults not on ART. 48 Artesunate is available for treatment of severe malaria through a compassionate use Investigational New Drug application. A trial in Uganda demonstrated the effectiveness of artesunate plus amodiaquine in HIV-infected children, but treatment was associated with increased risk of neutropenia in those on ART, particularly zidovudine, which was attributed to the amodiaquine component of therapy. 49 Ritonavir or cobicistat-boosed ARV regimens and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have the potential to affect metabolism of artemisinin-containing drugs, 50 but the overall effect and clinical significance remain unclear. No dose alterations currently are recommended. No immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been described in association with malaria. Managing Treatment Failure HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of malaria treatment failure.51 Management of treatment failure is the same in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients, except for considerations about drug interactions between ART and antimalarial drugs. Drug-resistant malaria and possible concomitant infections should be considered in HIV-infected patients whose malaria fails to respond to therapy. Preventing Recurrence If the species of malaria identified is P . vivax or P . ovale, which can cause recurrence due to hepatic phase of infection, then treatment with primaquine in addition to standard treatment is recommended to prevent recurrence (AI). Guidelines for primaquine treatment do not differ in HIV-infected individuals. Special Considerations During Pregnancy Malaria in pregnancy affects both mother and fetus. Infection with P . falciparum during pregnancy can increase maternal risk of severe disease and anemia and risk for stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birth weight. 52 The diagnosis of malaria in pregnant women is the same as in women who are not pregnant. For pregnant women with a diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria caused by P . treatment with chloroquine is recommended.53 For pregnant women with a diagnosis of chloroquine-resistant P . vivax , treatment with mefloquine for 7 days is recommended. For pregnant women with a diagnosis of uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum malaria, prompt treatment with mefloquine or quinine and clindamycin is recommended as per CDC guidelines. 54 On the basis of extensive experience with its use, chloroquine is considered the drug of choice for prophylaxis and treatment of sensitive strains of malaria in pregnancy. Although quinine at high doses has been associated with an increased risk of birth defects (especially deafness) in some animal species and humans (usually during attempted abortion), use of therapeutic doses in pregnancy is considered safe. 53,55 Because of the potential for hypoglycemia, glucose levels should be monitored in pregnant women treated with quinine and their neonates. Clindamycin use has not been associated with birth defects. Animal and human data on use of prophylactic and treatment doses of mefloquine do not suggest teratogenicity and the drug can be used safely during all trimesters. 56 One randomized trial of mefloquine used in addition to daily cotrimoxazole for malaria prophylaxis in pregnant women living with HIV demonstrated an increased risk of transmission of HIV to the infant in the mefloquine arm, potentially because of drug interactions. 57 Although experience is limited, available data on artemether-lumefantrine during pregnancy suggest that use is not associated with increased adverse events or birth defects. 58 A pharmacokinetic study in HIV-uninfected Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV S-6References 1.

The international limits and population at risk of Plasmodium vivax transmission persons found no difference in levels between pregnant and non-pregnant subjects except for small differences in elimination half-life of lumefantrine.59 Data on pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected pregnant women were not included. Because of limited data, atovaquone-proguanil is not recommended for treatment in pregnancy and should be used only if quinine plus clindamycin, quinine monotherapy, or mefloquine are unavailable or not tolerated. 55 Tetracyclines are not recommended in pregnancy because of increased risk of maternal hepatotoxicity and staining of fetal teeth and bones. Primaquine use during pregnancy is not recommended because of limited experience with its use and the potential for fetal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. After treatment, all pregnant women with P . vivax and P . ovale should receive chloroquine prophylaxis the duration of pregnancy to avoid relapses. Once-weekly mefloquine can be used for prophylaxis in pregnant women with P . vivax acquired in an area with chloroquine-resistant Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Malaria Preventing Malaria in Patients Traveling to Endemic Areas: Recommendations are the same for HIV -infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Specific recommendations are based on region of travel, malaria risks, and drug susceptibility in the region. Clinicians should refer to the following website for the most up-to-date recommendations: https://www.cdc.gov/malaria TMP-SMX has been shown to reduce malaria in HIV -infected adults in Africa. However, it is not as effective as antimalarial prophylactic regimens. Therefore, HIV-infected travelers should not rely on TMP-SMX for prophylaxis against malaria (AIII). Treating Malaria Because Plasmodium falciparum malaria can progress within hours from mild symptoms or low-grade fever to severe disease or death, all HIV-infected patients with confirmed or suspected P . falciparum infection should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to therapy (AIII). When suspicion of malaria is low , antimalarial treatment should not be initiated until the diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory investigations. T reatment should not be delayed when malaria is strongly suspected but laboratory services are unavailable or results will be delayed (AIII). When malaria is strongly suspected, but not yet confirmed, clinicians are advised to consider and initiate treatment for other possible diagnoses in addition to malaria. T reatment recommendations for HIV-infected patients are the same as HIV-uninfected patients (AIII). Choice of therapy is guided by the degree of parasitemia, the species of Plasmodium, the patient's clinical status, and the likely drug susceptibility of the infected species.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV T-1Microsporidiosis (Last updated June 14, 2019; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Microsporidia are protists related to fungi, defined by the presence of a unique invasive organelle consisting of a single polar tube that coils around the interior of the spore. They are ubiquitous organisms and are likely zoonotic and/or waterborne in origin. Phylogenetic studies now place microsporidia with the Cryptomycota as the basal branch of the fungal kingdom (or alternatively as a sister phylum). 1 The microsporidia reported as therapy (ART) era, reported prevalence rates of microsporidiosis varied between 2% and 70% among patients with HIV with diarrhea, depending on the diagnostic techniques employed and the patient population described. 3-5,8 The incidence of microsporidiosis has declined with the widespread use of effective ART, but continues to occur among patients with HIV who are unable to obtain ART or to remain on it. 9 Microsporidiosis is increasingly recognized among persons without HIV , including children, travelers, organ transplant recipients, contact lens wearers, and the elderly. In patients with immune suppression, clinical signs related to microsporidiosis are most commonly observed when CD4 T lymphocyte cell (CD4) counts are <100 cells/mm 3.3-5,8 Clinical Manifestations The most common manifestation of microsporidiosis is gastrointestinal tract infection with diarrhea; however, encephalitis, ocular infection, sinusitis, myositis, and disseminated infection have also been described. 3-5,8 Clinical syndromes can vary by infecting species. E. bieneusi is associated with malabsorption, diarrhea, and cholangitis. E. cuniculi is associated with hepatitis, encephalitis, and disseminated disease. E. intestinalis is associated with diarrhea, disseminated infection, and superficial keratoconjunctivitis. E. hellem is associated with superficial keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis, respiratory disease, prostatic abscesses, and disseminated infection. associated are immunocompetent are associated with myositis. Trachipleistophora is associated with encephalitis and disseminated disease. Diagnosis Effective morphologic demonstration of microsporidia by light microscopy can be accomplished with staining methods that produce differential contrast between the spores of the microsporidia and the cells and debris in clinical samples such as stool. In addition, because of the small size of the spores (1-5 mm), magnification up to 1,000 times is required for visualization. Chromotrope 2R and the fluorescent brighteners calcofluor white and Uvitex are useful as selective stains for microsporidia in stool and other body fluids. 7 In biopsy specimens, microsporidia can be visualized with Giemsa, tissue Gram disease, examination of three stools with chromotrope and chemofluorescent stains is often sufficient for diagnosis. If stool examination is negative and microsporidiosis is suspected, a small bowel biopsy may be useful. If the etiologic agent is Encephalitozoon or Trachipleistophora sp., examination of urine often also reveals the organism. Determination of the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV T-2species of microsporidia causing disease can be made by the morphology of the organism demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, by staining with species-specific antibodies, or by polymerase chain reaction using species- or genus-specific primers. 7,10 Assistance of specialists familiar with the species differentiation of microsporidia should be sought. Preventing Exposure Patients with AIDS who have CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 should avoid untreated water sources (AIII) . Additional recommendations include general attention to hand washing and personal hygiene, avoiding eating undercooked meat or seafood, and limiting exposure to animals known to be infected with microsporidia (BIII). 11 The precautions described in the section on cryptosporidiosis also are applicable to microsporidiosis. Preventing Disease Because chronic microsporidiosis occurs primarily in patients with advanced immunodeficiency, appropriate initiation of ART before the patient becomes severely immunosuppressed should prevent this disease (AII). No specific chemoprophylactic regimens are known to be effective in preventing microsporidiosis. Treating Disease Data suggest that treatment with ART enables a patient's own defenses to eradicate microsporidia,12,13 and administration of ART with immune restoration (an increase in CD4 count to >100 cells/mm3) is associated with resolution of symptoms of enteric microsporidiosis, including illness caused by E. bieneusi .12-15 All patients therefore should be offered ART as part of the initial management of microsporidial infection (AII). They should be given fluid support if they have signs of diarrhea and dehydration (AII). Patients with malnutrition and wasting should be treated with nutritional supplementation (AIII) . Antimotility agents can be used if required for diarrhea control (BIII). No specific therapeutic agent is available for E. bieneusi infection. A controlled clinical trial suggested that E. bieneusi infection may respond to oral fumagillin (60 mg/day), a water-insoluble antibiotic made by Aspergillus its synthetic analog, TNP-470 (BIII).18 Fumagillin and TNP-470 are not commercially available for systemic use in the United States. However, fumagillin is available from Sanofi in France as FLISINT \u00ae 20 mg, capsules and has been obtained for patients in the United States (see Sanofi's Compassionate Use/Managed Access Program website). One report indicated that treatment with nitazoxanide might resolve chronic diarrhea caused by E. bieneusi in the absence of ART; 19 however, the effect appeared to be minimal among patients with low CD4 cell counts. Based on personal experience of several experts who have treated diarrhea caused by E. bieneusi with nitazoxanide in organ transplant patients, nitazoxanide is a reasonable alternative, if fumagillin is not available, for the treatment of diarrhea due to E. bieneusi (CIII) . Albendazole, a benzimidazole that binds to -tubulin, has activity against many species of microsporidia, but it is not effective against Enterocytozoon or V . corneae infections. The tubulin genes of both E. bieneusi 20 and V corneae21 have amino acid residues associated with albendazole resistance. Albendazole is only recommended for initial therapy of intestinal and disseminated microsporidiosis caused by microsporidia other than E. bieneusi and V . corneae (AII). 22-24 Itraconazole may be useful in disseminated disease when combined with albendazole, especially in infections caused by Trachipleistophora or Anncaliia (CIII) . Treatment with furazolidone (an agent that is not currently available in the United States) combined with albendazole was reported to improve clinical signs in four patients with HIV with persistent diarrhea and E. bieneusi infection (CIII) ; 25 however, furazolidone has not been demonstrated to be active in other case reports. Metronidazole and atovaquone are not active in vitro or in animal models and should not be used to treat microsporidiosis (AII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV T-3Ocular infections caused by microsporidia should be treated with topical Fumidil B (fumagillin bicylohexylammonium) in saline (to achieve a concentration of 70 \u00b5g/mL of fumagillin) (BII).22 Topical fumagillin solution needs to be made by a compounding pharmacy as it is not commercially available in the United States and is investigational. Although clearance of microsporidia from the eye can be demonstrated, the organism often is still present systemically and can be detected in urine or in nasal smears. Therefore, the use of albendazole as a companion systemic agent to fumagillin is recommended in ocular infections (BIII). Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART As noted above, all patients should be offered ART as part of the initial management of microsporidial infection and fluid support if they have signs of diarrhea and dehydration (AII). Data suggest that treatment with ART, which results in immune reconstitution, enables a patient's own defenses to eradicate microsporidia. 12,13 Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Although side effects with albendazole are rare, hepatic enzymes should be monitored because elevations have been reported. Albendazole is not known to be carcinogenic or mutagenic. Topical fumagillin has not been associated with substantial side effects. Oral fumagillin has been associated with thrombocytopenia, which is reversible on stopping the drug. One report of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been described in a patient with HIV treated with ART in the setting of E. bieneusi infection; 26 however, no IRIS reactions have been reported with other species of microsporidia or with other cases of E. bieneusi . Concerns about IRIS should not alter therapy or the institution of ART (AIII) . Managing Treatment Failure Supportive treatment and optimization of ART to attempt to achieve full virologic suppression are the only currently feasible approaches to managing treatment failure (AIII) . Preventing Recurrence In individuals with relatively competent immune systems (>200 CD4 cells/mm3), treatment can probably be discontinued after ocular infection resolves (CIII) , but it should be continued indefinitely if CD4 counts fall below 200 cells/mm3 blood because recurrence or relapse may occur after treatment discontinuation (BIII). Whether it is safe to discontinue treatment for other manifestations after immune restoration with ART is unknown. Based on experience with discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis for other opportunistic infections, it is reasonable to discontinue chronic maintenance therapy in patients who no longer have signs and symptoms of microsporidiosis and have a sustained increase in their CD4 counts to >200 cells/mm 3 for 6 months after ART (BIII).13 Special Considerations During Pregnancy Rehydration and initiation of ART should be the mainstays of initial treatment of microsporidiosis during pregnancy, as in nonpregnant women (AII). In rats and rabbits, albendazole is embryotoxic and teratogenic at exposure levels less than those estimated with therapeutic human dosing. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of albendazole exposure in early human pregnancy. A recent randomized trial in which albendazole was used for second-trimester treatment of soil-transmitted helminth infections found no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse pregnancy effects. 27 Based on these data, albendazole is not recommended for use during the first trimester (BIII); use in later pregnancy should be considered only if benefits are felt to outweigh potential risk (CIII) . Systemic fumagillin has been associated with increased resorption and growth retardation in rats. No data on use in human pregnancy are available. However, because of the antiangiogenic effect of fumagillin, this drug Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV T-4should not be used systemically in pregnant women (AIII) . Topical fumagillin has not been associated with embryotoxic or teratogenic effects and can be considered when therapy with this agent is appropriate (CIII) . Furazolidone is not teratogenic in animal studies, but human data are limited to a case series that found no association between first-trimester use of furazolidone and birth defects in 132 furazolidone-exposed pregnancies. 28 Nitazoxanide has not been associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy and is a category B drug; however, data are very limited on its use during pregnancy (CIII) . Case reports exist of birth defects in infants exposed to itraconazole, but prospective cohort studies of >300 women with first-trimester exposure did not show an increased risk of malformation. 29,30 In general, however, azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester (BIII). Loperamide is poorly absorbed and has not been associated with birth defects in animal studies. However, a recent study identified an increased risk of congenital malformations, and specifically hypospadias, among 683 women with exposure to loperamide early in pregnancy. 31 Therefore, loperamide should be avoided in the first trimester, unless benefits are felt to outweigh potential risks (CIII) . Loperamide is the preferred antimotility agent in late pregnancy (CIII) . Opiate exposure in late pregnancy has been associated with neonatal respiratory depression, and chronic exposure may result in neonatal withdrawal, therefore tincture of opium is not recommended in late pregnancy (AIII) . Recommendations for Managing Microsporidiosis Preventing Chronic Microsporidiosis: Because chronic microsporidiosis occurs primarily in persons with advanced immunodeficiency , initiation of ART before the patient becomes severely immunosuppressed should prevent the disease (AII). Managing Microsporidiosis: Initiate or optimize AR T with immune restoration to CD4 count >100 cells/mm3 (AII). Severe dehydration, malnutrition, and wasting should be managed by fluid support (AII) and nutritional supplements (AIII). Anti-motility agents can be used for diarrhea control, if required (BIII). For GI Infections Caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi The best treatment option is AR T and fluid support (AII). No specific therapeutic agent is available for this infection. Fumagillin 60 mg PO daily (BII) and TNP-470 (BIII) are two agents that are effective, but neither agent is available in the United States. Nitazoxanide can have a therapeutic effect, but this efficacy has been limited in patients with low CD4 cell counts (CIII). For Intestinal and Disseminated (Not Ocular) Infection Caused by Microsporidia Other Than E. bieneusi and Vittaforma corneae: Albendazole 400 mg PO twice daily (AII), continue until CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 for >6 months after initiation of ART (BIII) For Disseminated Disease Caused by Trachipleistophora or Anncaliia: Itraconazole 400 mg PO daily plus albendazole 400 mg PO two times a day (CIII) For Infection: \u00b5g/mL) eye drops: 2 drops every 2 hours for 4 days, then 2 drops four times daily (investigational use only in United States) (BII), plus albendazole 400 mg PO twice daily for management of systemic infection (BIII) For patients with CD4 count >200 cells/mm3, therapy can probably be discontinued after ocular infection resolves (CIII). For patients with CD4 count 200 cells/mm3, therapy should be continued until resolution of ocular symptoms and CD4 count increases to >200 cells/mm3 for 6 months in response to ART (BIII).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV U-1Mycobacterium avium Complex Disease (Last updated February 15, 2019; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Organisms of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are ubiquitous in the environment.1-6 In the era prior to the availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), M. avium was the etiologic agent in >95% of people living with HIV with advanced immunosuppression who acquired disseminated MAC disease.4,7-12 Recent studies conducted using newer bacterial typing technology suggest organisms causing bacteremia in people with HIV include a diversity of species, including the M. avium subspecies hominissuis and M. colombiense .13 An estimated 7% to 12% of adults have previously contracted MAC, although rates of disease vary in different geographic locations. 2,4,8,11,12 Although epidemiologic associations have been identified, no environmental exposure or behavior has been consistently linked to subsequent risk of developing MAC disease. The mode of MAC transmission is thought to be through inhalation, ingestion, or inoculation of MAC bacteria via the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract.1,14 Household or close contacts of those with MAC disease do not appear to be at increased risk of disease, and person-to-person transmission is unlikely. MAC disease typically occurs in people with HIV with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <50 cells/ mm3. The incidence of disseminated MAC disease is 20% to 40% in people with HIV with advanced immunosuppression in the absence of effective ART or chemoprophylaxis.15,16 The overall incidence of MAC disease among people living with HIV has continued to decline in the modern ART era to current levels of <2 cases of MAC as the first opportunistic infection [OI] per 1,000 person-years for individuals in care. 17-20 In addition to CD4 count <50 cells/mm3, factors associated with increased risk for MAC disease identified in recent studies are plasma HIV RNA levels >1,000 copies/mL, ongoing viral replication despite ART, previous or concurrent OIs, and reduced in vitro lymphoproliferative immune responses to M. avium antigens, possibly reflecting defects in T-cell repertoire.18-20 Clinical Manifestations In people living with HIV with advanced immunosuppression who are not on ART, MAC disease often is a disseminated, multi-organ infection, although localized disease may also be seen. 21-25 Early symptoms may be minimal and can precede detectable mycobacteremia by several weeks. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 8 Laboratory abnormalities particularly associated with disseminated MAC disease include anemia (often out of proportion to that expected for the stage of HIV disease) and elevated liver alkaline or less commonly peripheral) may be identified on physical examination or by radiographic or other imaging studies. Other focal physical findings or laboratory abnormalities may occur with localized disease. In comparison to people with HIV who are not receiving or not responding to ART, localized manifestations of MAC disease have been reported more often in people with HIV who are receiving and have responded to ART with an increase in CD4 cell counts, suggesting improved immune function. Localized syndromes include cervical, intraabdominal or mediastinal lymphadenitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin or soft-tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, or central nervous system infection. Localized syndromes may also be manifestations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), as discussed below. IRIS is recognized as a systemic inflammatory syndrome with signs and symptoms that are clinically indistinguishable from active MAC infection, although bacteremia is generally absent. Similar to tuberculosis (TB), MAC-associated IRIS can occur as \"unmasking\" IRIS in people with HIV with subclinical (undiagnosed) MAC or \"paradoxical\" IRIS in those with previously established MAC disease. 28-32 Both variants occur primarily in those with advanced immunosuppression who begin ART and have a rapid and marked reduction Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV U-2in plasma HIV RNA.32,33 The syndrome may be benign and self-limited or may result in severe, unremitting symptoms that improve with the use of systemic anti-inflammatory therapy or corticosteroids. Diagnosis A confirmed diagnosis of disseminated MAC disease is based on compatible clinical signs and symptoms coupled with the isolation of MAC from cultures of blood, lymph node, bone marrow, or other normally sterile tissue or body fluids. 16,24,25,34,35 Species identification should be performed using molecular techniques, polymerase chain reaction-based assays, whole genome sequencing, high-performance liquid chromatography, or biochemical tests. Other ancillary studies provide supportive diagnostic information, including acid-fast bacilli smear and culture of stool or tissue biopsy material, radiographic imaging, or other studies aimed at isolating organisms from focal infection sites. Detection of MAC organisms in the respiratory or GI tract may represent colonization of these sites and may be a harbinger of disseminated MAC infection. However, no data are available regarding efficacy of treatment with clarithromycin, azithromycin, rifabutin, or other drugs alone or in combination for asymptomatic colonization with MAC organisms at these sites. Therefore, routine screening of respiratory or GI specimens and pre-emptive treatment for MAC is not recommended. Preventing Exposure MAC organisms commonly contaminate environmental sources of infection, such as food and water. Available information does not support specific recommendations regarding avoidance of exposure. Preventing Disease Indication for Primary Prophylaxis Primary prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease is not recommended for adults and adolescents with HIV who immediately initiate ART (AII) . People with HIV who are not receiving ART or who remain viremic on ART but have no current options for a fully suppressive ART regimen should receive chemoprophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease if they have CD4 counts <50 cells/mm 3 (AI). Primary MAC prophylaxis, if previously initiated, should be discontinued in adults and adolescents who are continuing on a fully suppressive ART regimen (AI). Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials and observational data have demonstrated that people with HIV taking ART can discontinue primary prophylaxis with minimal risk of developing MAC disease. 36-40 This updated recommendation is based on data from recent observational cohort studies. In an analysis of 369 people with HIV with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm 3 while on ART and followed for at least six months, the overall incidence of MAC disease was 0.6 per 100 person-months. No MAC occurred among 71 persons on ART who were virologically suppressed at baseline, including 41 persons who were not receiving primary MAC prophylaxis. 41 Another study enrolled 157 people with HIV who had at least one CD4 count <50 cells/ mm3 and had started ART between 1998 and 2014. The study compared the incidence of disseminated MAC disease within the 12 months after the first CD4 count <50 cells/mm3 between a group of 33 participants who received primary MAC prophylaxis and a group of 122 participants who received no MAC prophylaxis.20 There were no differences between the groups in the proportion of participants who achieved or the time to achieve a CD4 count >100 cells/mm 3 or in the proportion of participants who achieved viral suppression within 12 months. The incidence of MAC disease was not statistically significantly different between the groups; 3.4 per 100 person-years for those on primary prophylaxis versus 0.8 per 100 person-years for those not on primary prophylaxis. In each of these studies, plasma HIV RNA level >1,000 copies/mL was the principal risk factor for developing MAC disease regardless of MAC prophylaxis. In a study from the OI Working Group Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV U-3of the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE), the incidence of primary MAC disease was 0.74 per 1,000 person-years (IQ range 0.68 to 0.80} among people living with HIV on ART and not receiving MAC prophylaxis. 42 These data suggest that primary MAC prophylaxis provides no additional benefit in patients started on effective ART that results in viral suppression. Additional arguments against primary MAC prophylaxis include the potential for increased cost, adverse effects of the drugs used for prophylaxis, and, for the small number of people with HIV who might develop \"unmasking MAC IRIS\" after starting ART, the use of monotherapy for MAC prophylaxis may result in acquired drug resistance in those with active MAC disease. 43,44 Preferred and Alternative Drugs for Prophylaxis As previously stated, primary prophylaxis for MAC is not recommended, but for those for whom prophylaxis is being considered, azithromycin 45 and clarithromycin5,46 are the preferred prophylactic agents (AI).1,47 The combination of clarithromycin and rifabutin is no more effective than clarithromycin alone for chemoprophylaxis, is associated with a higher rate of adverse effects than either drug alone, and should not be used (AI).5 The combination of azithromycin and rifabutin is more effective than azithromycin alone in preventing MAC disease.45 However, based on the additional cost, increased occurrence of adverse effects, potential for drug interactions, and no greater survival benefit than with azithromycin alone, the combination regimen of azithromycin and rifabutin is not recommended (AI). Azithromycin and clarithromycin also each confer protection against respiratory bacterial infections. In people with HIV who cannot tolerate azithromycin or clarithromycin, rifabutin is an alternative prophylactic agent for MAC disease (BI), although drug interactions may complicate use of this agent. Before prophylaxis is initiated, disseminated MAC disease should be ruled out by clinical assessment and if appropriate based on that assessment, by obtaining a blood culture for MAC. TB also should be excluded before rifabutin is used for MAC prophylaxis because treatment with rifabutin monotherapy could result in acquired resistance to M. tuberculosis in people with HIV who have active TB. Treating Disease Initial treatment of MAC disease should consist of two or more antimycobacterial drugs to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance (AI).1,6,11,12,14,48-56 Clarithromycin is the preferred first agent (AI); it has been studied more extensively than azithromycin in people with AIDS and appears to be associated with more rapid clearance of MAC from the blood. 6,48,50,54,55,57 However, azithromycin can be substituted for clarithromycin when drug interactions or intolerance preclude the use of clarithromycin (AII) . Testing MAC isolates for susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is recommended for all people with HIV .58,59 Ethambutol is the recommended second drug for the initial treatment of MAC disease (AI). Some clinicians would add rifabutin as a third drug (CI). One randomized clinical trial demonstrated that adding rifabutin to the combination of clarithromycin and ethambutol improved survival, and in two randomized clinical trials, this approach reduced emergence of drug resistance 6,50 in individuals with AIDS and disseminated MAC disease. These studies were completed before the availability of effective ART. Whether similar results would be observed for people with HIV receiving effective ART has not been established. Some experts would recommend the addition of a third or fourth drug in settings in which the risk of mortality is increased and emergence of drug resistance is most likely, such as with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 count <50 cells/mm 3), high mycobacterial loads (>2 log 10 colony-forming units/mL of blood), and/or the absence of effective ART (CIII) . The third or fourth drug might include a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin (CIII) , which have in vitro and animal model activity against MAC, or an injectable agent such as amikacin or streptomycin (CIII) , although no randomized clinical trials have evaluated the added efficacy of these antibiotics in the setting of clarithromycin or azithromycin treatment or effective ART.58,60 Special Considerations with Regard to Starting Antiretroviral Therapy ART should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis of MAC disease, preferably at the same time as initiation of antimycobacterial therapy in people with HIV and disseminated MAC disease who are not Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV U-4receiving effective ART (CIII) . The rationale for starting ART as soon as possible is to reduce the risk of further AIDS-defining OIs and to further improve the response to antimycobacterial therapy in the setting of advanced immunosuppression (CIII) . If ART has already been initiated, it should be continued. The regimens should be modified when there is any potential for an adverse drug-drug interaction(s) between the antiretroviral and antimycobacterial drugs (CIII) . People with HIV will need continuous antimycobacterial treatment unless ART results in immune reconstitution. Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (including IRIS) A repeat blood culture for MAC should be obtained 4 weeks to 8 weeks after initiating antimycobacterial therapy only in people with HIV who do not have a clinical response to their initial treatment regimens. Improvement in fever and a decline in quantity of mycobacteria in blood or tissue can be expected within 2 weeks to 4 weeks after initiation of appropriate therapy; clinical response may be delayed, however, in those with more extensive MAC disease or advanced immunosuppression. Adverse effects with clarithromycin and azithromycin include gastrointestinal upset, metallic taste, elevations in liver transaminase levels or hypersensitivity reactions. These adverse effects may be exacerbated when drug levels are increased due to drug interactions associated with rifabutin or some antiretroviral drugs. Doses of clarithromycin >1 g/day for treatment of disseminated MAC disease have been associated with increased mortality and should not be used (AI).61 When used with clarithromycin or other drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzyme 34, rifabutin has been associated with a higher risk of adverse drug interactions.62,63 Given complex drug interactions, if rifabutin is used, dose adjustment is necessary in people with HIV receiving protease inhibitors (PIs), efavirenz, rilpivirine, or doravirine; rifabutin should not be used with elvitegravir/cobicistat or bictegravir. 64-71 No dose adjustment for rifabutin or integrase inhibitors, other than elvitegravir/cobicistat or bictegravir, is currently recommended.72,73 The most updated drug-drug interaction information can be found in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines . PIs can increase clarithromycin levels, but no recommendation to adjust the dose of either clarithromycin or PIs can be made based on existing data. The ability of efavirenz to induce metabolism of clarithromycin can result in reduced serum concentration of clarithromycin but increased concentration of the 14-OH active metabolite of clarithromycin. Although the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown, it could reduce the efficacy of clarithromycin for MAC prophylaxis. Azithromycin metabolism is not affected by the CYP450 system; azithromycin can be used safely in the presence of PIs, NNRTIs, or integrase inhibitors without concerns about drug interactions. People with HIV on ART who develop moderate-to-severe symptoms typical of IRIS should receive initial treatment with non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (CIII) . If IRIS symptoms do not improve, short-term (4 weeks-8 weeks) systemic corticosteroid therapy, in doses equivalent to 20 to 40 mg of oral prednisone daily, has been successful in reducing symptoms and morbidity (CII) .29,74 Managing Treatment Failure MAC treatment failure is defined by the absence of a clinical response and the persistence of mycobacteremia after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. Repeat testing of MAC isolates for susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is recommended for people with HIV whose disease relapses after an initial response to treatment. Most people with HIV who experience failure of clarithromycin or azithromycin primary prophylaxis in clinical trials had isolates susceptible to these drugs when MAC disease was detected. 6,11,12,48,75,76 Because the number of drugs with demonstrated clinical activity against MAC is limited, results of susceptibility testing should be used to construct a new multidrug regimen. The regimen should consist of at least two new drugs (i.e., not previously used) to which the isolate is susceptible. Drugs from which to choose are rifabutin, an injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or streptomycin), or a fluoroquinolone or moxifloxacin), although data supporting a survival or microbiologic benefit when these agents are added have not been compelling (CII) .11,12,49-53,57,77-81 Data in people without HIV who are being treated for MAC Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV U-5indicate that an injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or streptomycin) is a viable choice (CIII) .58 Continuing clarithromycin or azithromycin despite resistance is generally not recommended as there is likely to be no additional benefit and may be added toxicity. Clofazimine should not be used because randomized trials have demonstrated lack of efficacy and an association with increased mortality (AI).49,51,79 Anecdotal evidence exists for the addition of one or more other second-line agents (e.g., ethionamide, thioacetazone [not available in the United States], cycloserine, or linezolid) to the combination of clarithromycin or azithromycin and other drugs as salvage therapy, but their role in this setting is not well defined. Optimization of ART is an important adjunct to second-line or salvage therapy for MAC disease in people with HIV for whom initial treatment is unsuccessful or who have disease that is resistant to antimycobacterial drugs (AIII) . Adjunctive treatment of MAC disease with immunomodulators has not been thoroughly studied, and data are insufficient to support a recommendation for its routine use. Preventing Recurrence People with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should continue chronic maintenance therapy (AII) unless ART results in immune reconstitution.37,38 When to Stop Secondary Prophylaxis or Chronic Maintenance Therapy The risk of MAC recurrence is low in people with HIV who have completed at least a 12-month MAC treatment course, remain asymptomatic with respect to MAC signs and symptoms, and sustain an increase in CD4 count to >100 cells/mm 3 for 6 months after initiation of ART. In this setting, it is reasonable to discontinue maintenance therapy based on data from studies in people with HIV and inferences from more extensive study data that indicate the safety of discontinuing secondary prophylaxis for other OIs (AI).38,53,82-86 Reintroducing chronic maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis for people with HIV for whom a fully suppressive ART regimen is not possible and who have a decline in their CD4 count to levels consistently below 100 cells/mm 3 may be indicated (BIII) . Special Considerations During Pregnancy Primary prophylaxis for MAC disease in pregnant women and adolescents is not recommended (AIII) . Because clarithromycin is associated with an increased risk of birth defects based on evidence from certain animal studies, it is not recommended as the first-line agent for prophylaxis or treatment of MAC in pregnancy (BIII) . Two studies, each with slightly more than 100 women with first-trimester exposure to clarithromycin, did not demonstrate an increase in or specific pattern of defects, although an increased risk of spontaneous abortion was noted in one study. 87,88 Azithromycin did not produce defects in animal studies, but experience is limited with use in humans during the first trimester. A nested case-control study conducted within the large Quebec Pregnancy cohort found an association between azithromycin use and spontaneous miscarriage. 89 However, the authors were not able to adjust for severity of infection, an important confounder. Multiple studies, including large cohort studies, have found no association between the use of azithromycins in the first trimester and major congenital malformations, include heart defects. 90-92 When primary prophylaxis is required for a pregnant woman who is not being treated with effective ART, azithromycin is the preferred agent (BIII) . For secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy), azithromycin plus ethambutol is the preferred drug combination (BIII) . Diagnostic considerations and indications for treatment of MAC disease for pregnant women are the same as for women who are not pregnant. On the basis of animal data discussed previously, azithromycin is preferred over clarithromycin as the first-line agent to use in combination with ethambutol for treatment of MAC disease (BIII) . Use of ethambutol rather than rifabutin or other agents with the potential for drug-drug interactions should allow initiation of ART as soon as possible during pregnancy to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV . Pregnant women whose MAC disease fails to respond to a primary regimen should be managed in consultation with infectious disease and obstetrical specialists. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV U-6Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex Disease Preventing First Episode of Disseminated MAC Disease (Primary Prophylaxis) Primar y prophylaxis is not recommended for adults and adolescents who immediately initiate ART (AII). Indications for Initiating Primary Prophylaxis: Not on fully suppressive AR T, and CD4 count <50 cells/mm3 after ruling out disseminated MAC disease based on clinical assessment (which may include mycobacterial blood culture for some people with HIV) (AI) Preferred Therapy: Azithromycin 1200 mg PO once weekly (AI), or Clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID (AI), or Azithromycin 600 mg PO twice weekly (BIII) Alternative Therapy: Rifabutin 300 mg PO daily (BI) (dose adjustment may be necessary based on drug-drug interactions, please refer to Table 5 for dosing recommendation when used with ARV drugs). Note: Active TB should be ruled out before starting rifabutin. Indication for Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis: Initiation of effective AR T (AI) Indication for Restarting Primary Prophylaxis: CD4 count <50 cells/mm3 (only if not on fully suppressive ART) (AIII) Treating Disseminated MAC Disease Preferred Therapy: At least 2 drugs as initial therapy to prevent or delay emergence of resistance (AI) Clarithromycin 500 mg PO twice daily (AI) plus ethambutol 15 mg/kg PO daily (AI), or Azithromycin 500-600 mg (AII) plus ethambutol 15 mg/kg PO daily (AI) when drug interactions or intolerance precludes the use of clarithromycin Note: Testing of susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is recommended. Alternative Therapy: Some experts would recommend addition of a third or fourth drug for people with HIV with high mycobacterial loads (i.e ., >2 log CFU/mL of blood), or in the absence of effective ART (CIII). The Third or Fourth Drug Options May Include: Rifabutin 300 mg PO daily (CI) (dose adjustment may be necessary based on drug-drug interactions), or A fluoroquinolone (CIII) (e.g., levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily), or An injectable aminoglycoside (CIII) (e.g., amikacin 10-15 mg/kg IV daily or streptomycin 1 gm IV or IM daily) Chronic Maintenance Therapy (Secondary Prophylaxis): Same as treatment regimens Criteria for Discontinuing Chronic Maintenance Therapy (AII): Completed at least 12 months therapy, and No signs and symptoms of MAC disease, and Have sustained (>6 months) CD4 count >100 cells/mm3 in response to for Secondary Prophylaxis: CD4 <100 cells/mm3 (AIII) Other Considerations NSAIDs may be used for people with HIV who experience moderate to severe symptoms attributed to IRIS (CIII). If IRIS symptoms persist, a short-term course (4 weeks-8 weeks) of systemic corticosteroid (equivalent to prednisone 20-40 mg) can be used (CII).

Safety of macrolides during Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-1Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection and Disease (Last updated September 27, 2019; last reviewed September 27, 2019) Epidemiology Despite being preventable and curable, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from infectious disease globally, with 10.4 million people developing TB and 1.7 million people dying from TB in 2016.1 TB is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV worldwide, with 1 million persons with HIV reported to have TB and 374,000 deaths due to TB among PLHIV in 2016. TB infection occurs when a person inhales droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Usually within 2 to 12 weeks after infection, the immune response limits multiplication of tubercle bacilli. However, viable bacilli persist for years, a condition referred to as latent TB infection (LTBI). Persons with LTBI are asymptomatic and are not infectious. TB disease (defined as clinically active disease, often with positive smears and cultures) can develop soon after exposure to M. tuberculosis organisms (primary disease) or after reactivation of latent infection. The annual risk of TB disease due to reactivation of LTBI for persons with untreated HIV infection has been estimated as 3% to 16% per year, which approximates the lifetime risk of TB disease for persons with LTBI who are HIV negative (approximately 5%). 2 The risk of TB begins in the first year following HIV infection.3 TB infection can occur at any CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count, though the risk increases with progressive immunodeficiency.3,4 The advent of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of TB disease among persons with HIV infection, and this effect has been documented in settings with low case rates of TB among PLHIV , such as the United States, 5 and in settings with very high case rates.6-9 However, even with the beneficial effects of ART, the risk of TB disease among persons with HIV infection remains greater than that of the general population. 10 Rates of TB in the United States are declining, with 2.8 new cases of TB disease per 100,000 population (a total of 9,105 cases) reported in 2017, a 2.3% decline in TB incidence from 2016. 11 This was the lowest number of annual cases reported on record although regional differences in incidence are noted, and TB outbreaks in U.S. communities continue to occur. The prevalence of LTBI in the general population of the United States is 4.7%, 12 which has remained unchanged since the last survey in 1999-2000. The incidence of HIV-related TB has declined more rapidly than the rate of active TB disease in the general population,13 in part due to the widespread use of ART. Among all cases of TB reported in the United States in 2017, there were 439 persons coinfected with HIV (5.5% of TB cases that had HIV test result information). 11 Like TB disease in the general U.S. population, HIV-related TB is increasingly a disease of persons born outside of the United States. 13 Despite these favorable epidemiological trends, TB remains an important opportunistic illness in the United States and globally. Unlike most opportunistic infections (OIs), TB is transmissible from persons to person, particularly to persons with HIV infection. Therefore, clinicians providing care for persons with HIV must remain vigilant in efforts to prevent TB, knowledgeable about the clinical presentation of HIV-related TB, and cognizant of the complexities of the co-treatment of HIV and TB. Preventing Exposure In the United States, the most common predisposing factor for TB infection is birth or residence outside of the United States. 12 Therefore, persons with HIV infection who live or work internationally in settings with a high prevalence of TB should be counseled about the risk of TB acquisition and the advisability of getting tested for LTBI upon returning to the United States. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-2Preventing Disease: Diagnosing and Treating Latent TB Infection The estimated annual risk for active TB disease among persons with LTBI (diagnosed by a positive tuberculin skin test [TST] or interferon gamma release assay [IGRA] in the absence of a TB disease diagnosis) is 3 to 12 times greater for persons with HIV than for those without HIV . 14,15 Furthermore, in two studies among adults with HIV , persons who developed TB had higher viral loads16 and a greater risk of HIV disease progression16 and death17 than CD4-matched control patients without TB. The risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease in persons with HIV is reduced both by ART and by treatment of LTBI.18 In combination with ART, treatment of LTBI decreases the risk of TB disease by 76% among persons with HIV infection.19 Isoniazid preventive therapy and ART independently and additively decrease the risk of death and severe HIV-related illness.9,18 In a study that compared isoniazid preventive therapy to placebo among persons receiving ART, isoniazid further reduced the risk of TB by 37%. 8 In a cluster randomized trial in Brazil, a country with medium TB burden, the rate of TB was lower in the isoniazid group than in the group that did not receive isoniazid at 7 years of follow-up, suggesting a durable effect of 6-month isoniazid in reducing the risk of TB disease in persons with HIV with a positive TST. 20 Therefore, prevention of TB disease by screening for and treating LTBI, along with ART initiation, are key components of HIV care. Diagnosing Latent TB Infection All persons with HIV should be tested for LTBI at the time of HIV diagnosis, regardless of their epidemiological risk of TB exposure (AII). The two current methods available for detection of M. tuberculosis infection in the United States, IGRA and TST, help differentiate infected from uninfected people. However, diagnostic accuracy of TST and IGRA are limited; a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis of LTBI or TB disease, and a positive test does not in itself mean LTBI therapy is warranted. The decisions about medical and public health management should include epidemiological, historical, and other clinical information when using IGRA or TST results. Decisions should not be based on IGRA or TST results alone. Among persons with HIV , some studies found that the benefit of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) was seen primarily in persons with a positive TST. 21,22 However, in one study in South Africa, a setting with a high TB burden, IPT decreased the TB risk among all persons with HIV regardless of TST or IGRA result.8 Another recent study from West Africa found improved survival with IPT regardless of TST or IGRA status.18 Persons with negative diagnostic tests for LTBI, advanced HIV infection (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3), and without indications for initiating empiric LTBI treatment (i.e., no recent exposure to a culture-confirmed TB case) should be re-tested for LTBI once they start ART and attain a CD4 count 200 cells/mm 3 to ensure that the initial test result was a true negative result.23,24 Annual testing for LTBI using TST is recommended for persons with HIV who are at high risk for repeated or ongoing exposure to persons with active TB disease (AIII) . Traditionally, LTBI has been defined by the presence of a positive TST (5 mm of induration at 48 to 72 hours in persons with HIV) in persons with no clinical or radiographic evidence of TB disease. Despite the extensive experience with the TST among persons with HIV , the test has several disadvantages: the requirement for two visits to place and read the test, decreased specificity (false positive results) among persons who received Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination, and decreased sensitivity (false negative results) among persons with advanced immunodeficiency. 25 These limitations of the TST have led to broader use of IGRAs for detection of LTBI. Current evidence suggests that IGRAs have higher specificity than the TST, (92% to 97% vs. 56% to 95%, respectively), better correlation with surrogate measures of exposure to M. tuberculosis,26 and less cross-reactivity with BCG vaccination and nontuberculous mycobacteria.27,28 Two IGRAs are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and available in the United States. As with the TST, progressive immunodeficiency is associated with decreased sensitivity of IGRAs. 29 In addition, the reproducibility of positive results of IGRAs has been limited among health care workers, one of the few groups that routinely undergo repeated IGRA testing in the United States. 30 Poor reproducibility might also affect those with HIV . Among 46 persons with HIV who had initial positive tests with the IGRA QuantiFERON-TB Gold In- Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-3Tube assay, 33 (72%) had negative repeat tests, particularly those with responses at the lower range of the manufacturer's suggested range of positive results.31 Among persons with HIV , the correlation between the TST and IGRA test results is poor to moderate.32,33 In prospective studies, positive results with either the TST or IGRA were associated with an increased risk of developing TB disease; 34-36 in some studies, patients with a positive IGRA were at a higher risk of subsequently developing TB disease than were those with a positive TST.37,38 Despite its limitations, a positive TST result remains strongly predictive of decreased risk of TB progression in response to IPT among persons with HIV infection. 17 Studies are underway to formally evaluate if IGRAs are similarly predictive. In programmatic settings in the United States, TB screening based on the TST has been suboptimal, with only 47% to 65% of patients completing screening. 39-41 The use of an IGRA for TB screening may increase the proportion of patients who complete TB screening. There have been no published definitive comparisons of the TST and IGRAs for screening persons with HIV in low-burden settings such as the United States. Both the TST and the approved IGRAs are appropriate for TB screening among persons with HIV in the United States. 42 Some experts have suggested using both the TST and an IGRA in a stepwise manner to screen for LTBI, but the predictive value of this approach is not clear, and its adoption may be challenging to implement. The routine use of both TST and IGRAs in a single patient to screen for LTBI is not recommended in the United States. 42 As tests of immune reactivity against M. tuberculosis, the TST and IGRAs are often positive among persons with TB disease. Therefore, all persons with a positive TST or IGRA should be evaluated for the possibility of active TB disease. Most, but not all, persons with HIV with TB disease have symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy); absence of any of these symptoms has a 97% negative predictive value for culture-positive TB, though this varies depending on pre-test probability. 43 The addition of a chest radiograph improved sensitivity of this screening algorithm, but decreased specificity. Obtaining a sputum culture is the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary TB disease but is not high yield in screening asymptomatic persons with HIV , particularly in the United States where the prevalence of TB is very low. Therefore, a negative symptom screen (including absent cough of any duration) coupled with a normal chest radiograph is usually sufficient to exclude TB disease in a patient with a positive TST or IGRA. Treating Latent TB Infection Once TB disease is excluded and in the absence of other medical contraindications, persons with HIV and a positive TB screening test should receive LTBI treatment (AI), unless there is documentation of prior treatment for active TB or LTBI. Additionally, persons with HIV who are in close contact with anyone with infectious TB should receive LTBI treatment, regardless of their TB screening test results (AI). Persons with HIV in the United States who have a negative TST or IGRA and no recent contact with a person with infectious TB will likely not benefit from treatment of LTBI and preventive therapy is not generally recommended (AI). 21,44-46 In the international setting, two recent studies from high-burden areas of South Africa showed isoniazid decreased TB risk8 and mortality18 regardless of TST or IGRA result. Preferred and Alternative Drugs for Treating Latent TB Infection, Including Duration of Therapy Isoniazid prophylaxis for 9 months remains a preferred therapy, with proven efficacy, good tolerability, and infrequent severe toxicity (AI). Although peripheral neuropathy, hepatitis, and rash may be caused by either isoniazid or various antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, the risk of hepatitis\u2014the most important of these adverse effects\u2014is not significantly increased when isoniazid is combined with efavirenz- or nevirapine-based regimens. 8 Isoniazid prophylaxis should be supplemented with pyridoxine at a dose of 25 to 50 mg/ day to prevent peripheral neuropathy (AIII) . A significant disadvantage of the 9-month regimen is that the majority of patients do not complete all 9 months of therapy.47 Patients are more likely to complete shorter regimens.47-50 Additional regimens for chemoprophylaxis are shown in Table 1 .51 In two randomized Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-4controlled trials, rifapentine plus isoniazid once weekly for 12 weeks (3HP) was as effective and well- tolerated as 6 to 9 months of daily LTBI treatment with isoniazid, including in persons with HIV whose CD4 counts were generally >350 cells/mm 3 and who were not yet on ART.52,53 A recent study demonstrated that 3HP treatment completion rates with self-administered therapy were inferior to those with directly-observed therapy, but non-inferior among study participants enrolled in the United States\u2014and generally high overall. 54 Although individuals taking ART were not included in the Phase 3 trial of once-weekly rifapentine and isoniazid, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of efavirenz with daily rifapentine and isoniazid is favorable. 55 In a PK study of 12 adults with HIV without TB receiving once-weekly rifapentine 900 mg with efavirenz, rifapentine had minimal effect on efavirenz exposure.56 Raltegravir concentrations were modestly increased, not decreased, when it was given with once-weekly rifapentine.57 Thus, despite the lack of clinical trial outcome data, once-weekly rifapentine/isoniazid without dose adjustment based on available PK data is recommended when used in persons receiving efavirenz or raltegravir 58 (AII). Increased clinical monitoring is not routinely recommended, but should be based on clinical judgment. A large trial comparing 4 months of daily rifampin (4R) to 9 months of daily isoniazid (9H) was recently published.59 The study enrolled >6,000 participants who were predominantly HIV negative, and although rates of incident active TB were low in both arms, the 4R regimen was non-inferior to 9H for the primary efficacy outcome. Importantly, treatment completion rates were significantly higher and adverse events were less common in the 4R arm than in the 9H arm (78.8% vs. 63.2%; P < 0.001 and 1.5% vs. 2.6%; P = 0.003, respectively). Only 255 participants were HIV positive, however, which limits the generalizability of the findings to this population. Given the lack of trial data in PLWH, the 4R regimen is recommended only as an alternative to 9H and 3HP in persons with HIV who cannot receive isoniazid (BI). Furthermore, given the theoretical risks of rifamycin monotherapy in undiagnosed early-stage TB disease and the relatively poor performance of symptom screens alone in patients with HIV on ART, 60 clinicians may consider performing a sputum culture or chest radiograph before starting 4R for LTBI. When using rifampin for preventive therapy, either dose adjustment or substitution of key ART drugs may be needed. Regarding rifabutin monotherapy for the treatment of LTBI there are no data demonstrating its efficacy in people with or without HIV infection. The regimen of two months rifampin plus pyrazinamide is not recommended given the risk of severe and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity (AII). 61,62 The BRIEF-TB study (ACTG 5279) evaluated 1 month of daily rifapentine plus isoniazid (1HP) versus 9 months of daily isoniazid (9H) in PLWH residing in mostly high TB burden settings (TB incidence >60 per 100,000 population). 63 The median CD4 count of study participants was 470 cells/mm3, 50% of the study population was on ART (efavirenz or nevirapine-based regimens) at study entry, and 21% of the study population was TST-positive. The study endpoint was the combination of confirmed or probable TB, death due to TB, and death due to unknown cause. The event rate was 0.65 per 100 person-years in the 1HP arm and 0.67 per 100 person-years in the 9H arm; non-inferiority of the 1HP arm was established. Treatment completion rates (by self-report) were 97% in the 1HP arm and 90% in the 9H arm. These results suggest that 1HP might be an alternative regimen for treatment of LTBI in certain situations, but the regimen has not been fully evaluated in low TB prevalence settings (only 10% of the study population was from the United States). Of note, only 23% of the participants had a positive test for LTBI; 10% of the participants at international sites did not have a TST due to manufacturer shortages, and IGRAs were only performed for U.S. participants. Furthermore, 13% had baseline CD4 counts <250 cells/mm 3, and 50% were not on ART at entry (although ART was started after enrollment). While the population enrolled was at high risk for LTBI in the setting of HIV and high endemic exposure, the number of persons at risk of progression to TB disease due to documented LTBI was low. LTBI treatment and ART act independently to decrease the risk of TB disease. 8,19,64,65 Therefore, use of both interventions is recommended for persons with LTBI (AI). For persons exposed to drug-resistant TB, a regimen for LTBI should be selected after consultation with experts or with public health authorities (AII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-5Monitoring for Adverse Events Related to Treating Latent TB Infection Individuals receiving self-administered daily chemoprophylaxis should be seen by the prescribing clinician monthly to assess adherence and evaluate for possible drug toxicity; generally, a clinician should not prescribe >1 month's supply of drugs. Although persons with HIV may not have a higher risk of hepatitis from isoniazid than persons without HIV , it is recommended that they have serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin levels measured before starting LTBI treatment and repeated if abnormal. 14 Persons with concomitant chronic viral hepatitis have an increased risk of isoniazid-related hepatotoxicity, and such patients should be monitored closely when treated for LTBI.66,67 With isoniazid, liver enzymes typically increase in the first 3 months of treatment but then, through the process of hepatic adaptation, return to normal despite continued therapy. If the serum aminotransferase level increases to greater than five times the upper limit of normal without symptoms or greater than three times the upper limit of normal with symptoms (or greater than two times the upper limit of normal among patients with baseline abnormal transaminases), chemoprophylaxis should be stopped. Factors that increase the risk of clinical hepatitis include daily alcohol consumption, underlying liver disease, and concurrent treatment with other hepatotoxic drugs. At each visit, patients should be asked about potential adverse effects of treatment for LTBI (e.g., unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesia of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever lasting 3 or more days, abdominal tenderness, easy bruising or bleeding, and arthralgia) and told to immediately stop medications and return to the clinic for an assessment should any of these occur. The ultimate decision regarding resumption of therapy with the same or different agents for LTBI treatment should be made after weighing the risk for additional hepatic injury against the benefit of preventing progression to TB disease 68 and in consultation with an expert in treating LTBI in persons with HIV infection. Clinical Manifestations of TB Disease Sputum culture-positive TB disease can be subclinical and patients with HIV/TB may remain asymptomatic. 69 In ambulatory PLWH, the presence of any one of the classic symptoms of TB disease (cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss) has high sensitivity but low specificity for diagnosing TB,43 but, the sensitivity of classic TB symptoms is lower in PLWH on ART.60 A clinical prediction model developed and validated in ambulatory patients with at least one classic TB symptom showed that a score consisting of ART status, CD4 count, body mass index, and presence of more than one TB symptom improved the specificity of diagnosing TB while retaining reasonable sensitivity. 70 In patients who are markedly immune suppressed, TB can be a severe systemic disease with high fevers, rapid progression, and features of sepsis. 71 World Health Organization (WHO) algorithms for diagnosing TB distinguish between ambulatory patients and those who are seriously ill, defined by the presence of one or more danger signs (respiratory rate >30/min, heart rate >120/min, temperature >39 \u00ba C, and inability to walk unaided). A study of inpatients with WHO danger signs and cough of any duration reported that the classic TB symptoms of fever, weight loss, and night sweats were not predictive of TB. 72 Rather, the following variables predicted TB: cough 14 days, inability to walk unaided, temperature >39\u00ba C, chest radiograph assessment, low hemoglobin, and elevated white blood cell count. The presentation of active TB disease is influenced by the degree of immunodeficiency.73,74 In patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3, HIV-related TB generally resembles TB among persons without HIV . Most patients have disease limited to the lungs, and common chest radiographic manifestations are upper lobe infiltrates with or without cavitation.75 In patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3, the chest radiographic findings of pulmonary TB are markedly different with infiltrates showing no predilection for the upper lobes, and cavitation is uncommon.73,75,76 Normal chest radiographs are not uncommon in patients with respiratory symptoms and positive sputum cultures. Adjunct thoracic CT scans may demonstrate mild reticulonodular infiltrates despite a normal chest radiograph. 77 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-6With increasing degrees of immunodeficiency, extrapulmonary (especially lymphadenitis, pleuritis, pericarditis, and meningitis) or are more common. Clinical manifestations of extrapulmonary TB in persons with HIV are not substantially different from those described in persons without HIV . TB must be considered in disease processes involving any site in the body, 78 especially processes related to central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal symptoms when early TB treatment is essential to improve outcomes. 79-81 After initiation of ART, immune reconstitution can unmask subclinical TB disease, resulting in pronounced inflammatory reactions at the sites of infection (see Unmasking TB-IRIS below). Diagnosis Initial diagnostic testing for TB disease is directed at the anatomic site of symptoms or signs (e.g., lungs, lymph nodes, urine, cerebrospinal fluid). The initial evaluation of a patient suspected of having HIV-related TB should always include a chest radiograph or other chest imaging, even in the absence of pulmonary symptoms or signs; pulmonary involvement is common at all CD4 counts. 69,82 However, chest radiography is an imperfect screen for pulmonary TB, particularly among patients with advanced immunodeficiency who can have TB culture positive sputum despite normal chest radiographs. 83,84 Therefore, sputum smear and culture should be performed in symptomatic patients being evaluated for possible TB disease who have a normal chest radiograph, as well as in persons with no pulmonary symptoms but evidence of TB disease elsewhere in the body. Sputum smear-negative TB is common among persons with HIV , particularly those with advanced immunodeficiency and non-cavitary disease. 85 However, the yield of sputum mycobacterial culture is not affected by HIV or the degree of immunodeficiency. When a sensitive broth culture technique is used, the sensitivity of sputum culture is quite high. 86,87 Smear and culture of three sputum specimens is recommended based on a large study in patients with HIV that showed a 10% incremental yield for broth culture between the second and third specimens. 88 Extrapulmonary and disseminated TB are more common in persons with HIV , particularly with advanced immunosuppression. 89,90 Nodal involvement is common in HIV-related TB, and the combined yield of histopathology, smear, and culture from needle aspirates of enlarged lymph nodes is quite high.91 Histopathologic findings also are affected by the degree of immunodeficiency. Persons with relatively intact immune function have typical granulomatous inflammation associated with TB disease. With progressive immunodeficiency, granulomas become poorly formed or can be completely absent. 74 Pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, ascites, and cerebrospinal fluid should be sampled if there is clinical evidence of involvement. The yield of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, culture, and nucleic acid amplification (NAA) is generally lower from extrapulmonary specimens than from sputum, but nonetheless these tests can be an important diagnostic tool when M. tuberculosis is isolated. The yield of mycobacterial urine and blood cultures depends on the clinical setting; among patients with advanced immunodeficiency, the yield of culture from these two readily-available body fluids can be relatively high 74,78 and may allow definitive diagnosis and be a source of an isolate for drug-susceptibility testing. Nucleic-Acid Amplification Testing: Standard mycobacterial cultures for TB may take weeks to months to grow, but rapid diagnosis is essential in patients with HIV given the risk of rapid clinical progression of TB among patients with advanced immunodeficiency. NAA tests provide rapid diagnosis of TB (some assays also provide rapid detection of drug resistance\u2014see below). NAA tests have at least two uses among patients with suspected HIV-related TB. First, NAA assays, if positive, are highly predictive of TB disease when performed on AFB smear-positive specimens. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are relatively common among patients with advanced immunodeficiency, and NAA tests can be used to direct therapy and make decisions about the need for respiratory isolation of patients with a smear-positive specimen. Second, NAA tests are more sensitive than AFB smear, being positive in 50% to 80% of smear-negative, culture- Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-7positive specimens92,93 and up to 90% when three NAA tests are performed. Therefore, it is recommended that for all patents with suspected pulmonary TB, a NAA test be performed on at least one specimen.94 NAA tests can also be used on extrapulmonary specimens with the caveat that the sensitivity is often lower than with sputum specimens. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is an automated NAA test that can detect both M. tuberculosis and mutations in the rpoB gene associated with rifampin resistance. It has been widely implemented in resource-limited settings with high TB prevalence and as a frontline TB diagnostic test in patients with HIV .95 Xpert MTB/RIF was licensed in the United States in 2013 for detection of M. tuberculosis and reporting of rifampin resistance directly from sputum samples96 and in 2015, as an aid in decisions regarding respiratory isolation.97 This assay combines simple processing requirements in the laboratory and rapid turnaround (results within 2 hours). In a recent meta-analysis, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF were 97% to 99%), respectively. The assay is somewhat less sensitive among patients with HIV (pooled sensitivity of 80%, 95% CI, 67% to 88%) than among patients without HIV (pooled sensitivity of 89%, 95% CI, 81% to 94%); 98 however, this may be in part attributed to a higher prevalence of smear negative disease in individuals with HIV . 99 In some studies, the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF has been related to CD4 count, with higher sensitivity among patients with more advanced immunodeficiency.100 In extrapulmonary specimens, a 2014 meta-analysis reported Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity of up to 95% in smear positive specimens and 69% in smear negative specimens. 101 Median sensitivity varied by specimen type, with higher yield from lymph nodes (96%), CSF (85%), and gastric aspirates (78%) and lower yield pleural (34%) and other non-pleural serous fluids (67%). a version of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was developed (MTB/RIF Ultra) to improve the sensitivity of the existing test platform. With several technical modifications, the newer cartridge has a limit of detection of 16 colony forming units (cfu) (compared to 113 cfu for the original Xpert MTB/RIF) and improved detection of rifampin resistance. 102 A large, multinational study tested clinical specimens using both the old and newer cartridges in parallel, as well as solid and liquid agar culture. The study found that Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra was superior to the older version of the assay (Xpert MTB/RIF), particularly in patients with smear-negative disease (sensitivities of 63% and 46%, respectively). 103 In a separate prospective study of people with HIV with suspected TB meningitis, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra testing of CSF was also found to have improved sensitivity of 95% versus 45% for Xpert MTB/RIF, and yield was increased with larger volumes of CSF. 104 On the basis of these findings, as well as a mathematical model, WHO has endorsed replacing the older cartridges with the new version worldwide, noting that the change will benefit most in those with smear-negative disease, such as people with HIV , children, and individuals with extrapulmonary TB such as TB meningitis. 105 The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra is currently not FDA approved or available in the United States. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM): LAM is an M. tuberculosis cell wall polysaccharide that can be detected in the urine of patients with TB. LAM can be detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a lateral flow point of care test. The diagnostic utility of LAM is limited by a low sensitivity, but it has the advantage of being available as a true point of care test that can be performed on urine. LAM has demonstrated the best performance in patients with HIV with low CD4 counts (<100 cells/mm 3) with a sensitivity of 37% to 56% and specificity of up to 95%.106-108 In addition, LAM has higher sensitivity in patients with worse prognoses.109 Combining LAM with other diagnostic strategies, such as Xpert MTB/RIF testing of sputum or urine, may improve the diagnostic utility of LAM and identify those at greatest risk of TB-related mortality. 110-112 Immune-Based Tests: Immunological tests for TB infection, the TST and IGRA, may be helpful in unusual circumstances in which it is difficult to obtain definitive culture evidence for active TB disease; evidence of prior TB infection increases the likelihood that a clinical illness may be TB disease. However, these tests are not diagnostic of active TB disease, and a negative TST or IGRA should never be interpreted as ruling out TB disease because TB may cause anergy and these tests may be negative in 11% to 30% of patients with active TB. 42 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-8Drug Resistance Testing: The presence of drug resistance should be considered in any patient with: Known exposure to a person with drug-resistant TB Residence in a setting with high rates of primary drug-resistant TB (e.g., a country or area with high rates of drug resistance in patients with newly diagnosed TB ) Persistently positive smear or culture results at or after 4 months of treatment Previous TB treatment, particularly if it was not directly observed or was interrupted for any reason. These patients should be prioritized for rapid molecular testing. Conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST) should be performed on the initial isolates from all patients suspected of having TB, as resistance to isoniazid and/or rifampin is associated with an increased risk of treatment failure, recurrent TB, and amplification of resistance to additional TB medications. 113 The presence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB; defined as resistance to extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB; MDR a fluoroquinolone and either kanamycin, amikacin, or capreomycin) is associated with a markedly increased risk of death. 114 Thus, early identification of drug resistance, with appropriate adjustment of the treatment regimen based on conventional DST results, is critical to the successful treatment of TB disease and to curbing transmission of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. For all patients with TB disease, drug-susceptibility to first-line TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) should be performed, regardless of the source of the specimen. DSTs should be repeated if sputum cultures remain positive for M. tuberculosis at or after 4 months of treatment or become positive 1 month or longer after culture conversion to negative. Resistance testing for second-line TB medications (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, capreomycin, ethionamide, and others) should be performed only in reference laboratories with substantial experience in these techniques and should be limited to specimens with resistance to first-line TB medications. Conventional Growth-Based Drug-Susceptibility Testing: Conventional DST is widely used and has been validated for first-line drugs. The disadvantage of this technique, however, is that the combined turn-around time of conventional broth or agar-based culture followed by DST may be as long as 6 weeks, 115 due to the slow growth of M. tuberculosis. During this time, patients with drug-resistant TB may be receiving ineffective, empiric first-line TB therapy, which could allow for ongoing transmission, further clinical deterioration, and death, particularly in individuals with HIV . 114 Yet for many second-line drugs used to treat MDR and XDR TB, conventional DST remains either the gold standard or the only available technique, as molecular correlates of phenotypic drug-resistance are poor. In 2018, WHO produced a technical report based on a systematic review of available minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data for phenotypically wild-type and non-wild type strains and associated sequencing of related resistance-determining genes. The report provided new recommendations for phenotypic DST of the second-line medications and modifications to breakpoints which also account for PK variability observed in clinical care. 116 Molecular Tests for Drug Resistance: Genotypic testing to identify mutations that confer drug resistance allows rapid detection of resistance. The relationship between these mutations and drug resistance has been studied for a number of TB medications. 117 Commercial NAA tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF identify resistance mutations associated with rifampin, and commercially available line probe assays (LPAs) identify genotypic for including Xpert MTB/ RIF and LPAs should always be confirmed with sequence based tests as well as growth-based DST. For initial evaluation of drug resistance, or confirmation of drug resistance identified by the above assays, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, has a Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance (MDDR) service that offers rapid molecular testing for first-and second-line TB medications at no charge for persons suspected of having drug-resistant TB (See the Report of Expert Consultations on Rapid Molecular Testing to Detect Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in the United States ). State TB programs and state labs should also be consulted for resistance testing options. Several assays can be Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-9performed on cultured isolates or directly on sputum specimens. The largest clinical experience with rapid molecular tests for rifampin resistance is with the Xpert MTB/RIF (pre-Ultra) assay. In a 2014 meta-analysis, the sensitivity of the assay for detection of rifampin resistance was 95% (95% CI, 90% to 97%) CI, 97% to 99%). 98 with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay can occur, and sequence-based testing should be done to confirm results. 119 However, the comparator for most studies\u2014phenotypic DST\u2014is not an absolute gold standard.120,121 Some isolates with rifampin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay have mutations in the rpoB gene, but are susceptible in phenotypic assays. Two recent analyses showed that treatment failure was more common among patients whose isolates had phenotypic susceptibility but mutations in the resistance-determining region of the rpoB gene than among patients whose isolates had wild type rpoB gene sequences. 122,123 In low MDR TB prevalence settings such as the United States, the positive predictive value of any test for rifampin resistance is limited. Therefore, isolates with an initial reading of rifampin resistance with the Xpert MTB/RIF should undergo confirmatory testing ( rpoB gene sequencing or phenotypic drug susceptibility testing), and in such cases, additional specimens should be obtained from the patient. Consultation with an expert in the diagnosis and treatment of MDR TB is recommended. Clinicians who suspect drug-resistant TB in a patient with HIV should make every effort to expedite a diagnosis and consult with their state TB program and CDC as needed. Treating Disease Preferred and Alternative Drugs for Treatment, Including Duration of Therapy TB among persons with advanced immunodeficiency can be a rapidly progressing and fatal illness if treatment is delayed. Furthermore, such patients often have smear-negative sputum specimens.86 Therefore, after collection of available specimens for culture and molecular diagnostic tests, empiric treatment for TB is warranted in patients with clinical and radiographic presentation suggestive of HIV-related TB (AIII) . Treatment of suspected TB for individuals with HIV is the same as for individuals without HIV and should include an initial four-drug combination of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (AI). If rapid DST results indicate resistance to rifampin, with or without resistance to other drugs, an initial MDR TB regimen\u2014including a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or aminoglycoside or capreomycin\u2014should be used (BIII) and can be adjusted as sequencing and conventional DST results become available. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is recommended for all patients with suspected HIV-related TB (AII). The likelihood of treatment success is further enhanced with comprehensive case management, assistance with housing and other social support, and, if needed, assistance to help patients establish or re-engage with HIV care (e.g., enhanced DOT). Drug-susceptible TB should be treated with a 2-month intensive phase of the four drugs listed above (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). Ethambutol can be discontinued when susceptibility to isoniazid and rifampin has been confirmed. Thereafter, isoniazid and a rifamycin are used in the continuation phase of therapy, generally recommended as an additional 4 months of treatment for uncomplicated TB (AI). Although intermittent dosing (administration less often than daily) of anti-TB treatment facilitates DOT, regimens that included twice- or thrice-weekly dosing during the intensive or continuation phase have been associated with an increased risk of treatment failure or relapse with acquired drug resistance to the rifamycin class, particularly in persons with HIV . 124-132 Therefore, daily therapy given as DOT is recommended during both the intensive and continuation treatment phase (AII).130,131,133 Observational studies and meta-analyses focused primarily on the intensive phase of treatment, and thrice-weekly therapy during the continuation phase was not systematically evaluated in the context of the risk of adverse TB outcomes (treatment failure, recurrence, or acquired drug resistance). 127 Although earlier recommendations for TB treatment in persons without HIV indicated that therapy should be based on the number of doses received rather than the duration Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-10of therapy, there are no data substantiating the minimum number of doses needed within a specified time interval in individuals with HIV . Every effort should be made to assure that patients receive daily therapy as previously described, allowing up to 28 weeks to complete 24 weeks (6 months) of treatment to accommodate brief interruptions of therapy for management of adverse drug reactions as described below. The optimal duration of TB treatment for patients with HIV and drug-susceptible TB disease is not known. In general, the outcomes of 6-month regimens (2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin) given as DOT to patients with HIV have been good. 134,135 A randomized trial in the United States showed excellent and comparable outcomes of TB therapy among patients assigned to 6 months or 9 months of therapy, but the trial was underpowered. 136 Two trials in high- burden settings showed higher risks of recurrent TB among patients treated with 6 months of therapy than among those assigned to 9- 124 or 12-month regimens.137 However, the applicability of these two trials to low-burden settings in which ART is used, such as the United States, is uncertain. Extension of therapy to 9 months is recommended for patients who have a positive sputum culture after 2 months of treatment or severe cavitary or disseminated extrapulmonary disease (BII). TB meningitis should be treated for 9 to 12 months (BII). The use of a higher rifampin dose and/or addition of a fluoroquinolone to treatment for CNS TB may be beneficial, but there are limited data to support its use. A recent randomized trial that compared 9 months of standard TB therapy that included rifampin at a dose of 10 mg/kg with an intensified regimen in which levofloxacin was added and rifampicin was given at a higher dose of 15 mg/kg showed similar rates of survival, adverse events, and secondary outcomes in individuals both with and without HIV who had TB meningitis. 138 Importantly, however, rifampin doses in the two arms were highly overlapping, and standard or even modestly-increased rifampin doses do not produce rifampin concentrations in the CSF that are above rifampin's MIC against M. tuberculosis in many patients. 139,140 It is unclear whether even higher doses of rifampin may be more effective, but small prospective studies have found that doses as high as 35 mg/kg were well tolerated in adults, and additional studies are underway. 141,142 A PK study of 60 participants in Indonesia suggested that rifampin administered in doses equivalent to 13 mg/kg or higher given intravenously (similar to 26 mg/kg delivered orally) reduced mortality, 143 but this finding requires confirmation in a larger trial. Addition of a fluoroquinolone may improve outcomes in patients with isoniazid-monoresistant tuberculous meningitis. 138 Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is recommended in individuals with HIV who have TB involving the CNS (AI). 81 The regimen used in trials of adjunctive for CNS disease were: weeks, then taper 0.1 mg/kg per week until dose of 0.1 mg/kg, then 4 mg per day and taper by 1 mg/week; total duration of 12 weeks). 81 Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy increases survival overall for patients with TB with CNS involvement, although studies were underpowered for detecting a statistically significant survival benefit for those with HIV . 81,144 Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is not recommended in the treatment of TB pericarditis (AI). In a randomized trial that compared adjunctive prednisolone with placebo, each administered for 6 weeks in individuals with and without HIV with tuberculous pericarditis, prednisolone was not associated with a significant reduction in the composite endpoint of death, cardiac tamponade, or constrictive pericarditis. Those receiving prednisolone also had a higher incidence of some cancers. 145 A Cochrane review similarly found no mortality benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids and a non-significant reduction in constrictive pericarditis. Notably, however, <20% of patients with HIV in the trials analyzed were receiving ART. 146 There have been no trials comparing different doses and treatment durations of adjunctive corticosteroids. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART Optimal management of HIV-related TB requires that both infections be addressed. Although data are conflicting whether sequential treatment of TB followed by initiation of ART is acceptable for persons with CD4 counts >220 to 250 cells/mm 3,147,148 results from large, international, randomized trials of immediate versus delayed initiation of ART indicate that, at all CD4 counts, people with HIV without active TB disease Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-11gain substantial health benefits from immediate ART.9,149,150 When coupled with the preponderance of data from randomized trials in persons with HIV and active TB disease, these results support the recommendation that ART should not be withheld until completion of TB treatment (AI). Co-treatment of HIV and TB is complex due to adherence demands of multidrug therapy for two infections, drug-drug interactions between the rifamycins and many ARV drugs, overlapping side effect profiles of anti-TB and ARV drugs, and the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), particularly with TB meningitis. However, concurrent treatment of HIV and TB for coinfected patients in the appropriate clinical setting improves survival 147 (particularly for persons with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3),151 decreases the risk of additional opportunistic illnesses,151,152 and, despite higher rates of IRIS at low CD4 counts, is not associated with higher rates of ARV or anti-TB drug related toxicity.148 The evidence supporting concurrent therapy comes from four trials. The SAPIT trial randomized 642 South African adults with CD4 counts <500 cells/mm3 and AFB smear- positive TB to start ART at either TB treatment initiation, after the intensive phase of TB therapy but before TB treatment completion, or after TB treatment completion.147 The study was stopped early because mortality in the two integrated treatment arms was 56% lower than in the sequential treatment arm, demonstrating that ART should be started before TB completion. Notably, there was a survival benefit across the range of CD4 counts among patients enrolled, including within the stratum of baseline CD4 counts from 200 to 500/mm 3. The CAMELIA, STRIDE (ACTG A5221), and TB-HAART trials shed further light on the optimal timing of ART during TB treatment. In CAMELIA, 661 adults in Cambodia with confirmed pulmonary TB and a median CD4 count of 25 cells/mm 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 10, 56) were randomized to receive ART at 2 or 8 weeks after starting TB treatment. The mortality rate decreased from 13.77 per 100 person-years in the 8-week arm to 8.28 per 100 person-years ( P = 0.002) in the 2-week arm, 153 and >95% of the study participants who survived had viral suppression. The ACTG A5221 STRIDE study randomized 809 participants from North America, South America, Africa, and Asia with confirmed or suspected TB and a median CD4 count of 77 cells/mm3 (IQR, 33,146) to immediate ART (within 2 weeks of TB treatment initiation) or early ART (8-12 weeks after TB treatment initiation). 151 A new OI or death occurred among 12.9% of participants in the immediate arm and 16.1% in the early arm by week 48 ( P = 0.45). Among participants with screening CD4 count <50 cells/mm3, 15.5% on immediate ART versus 26.6% on early ART developed AIDS or died (P = 0.02). TB-associated IRIS (TB-IRIS) was more common among participants in the immediate ART arm (11%) than in the early ART arm (5%) (P = 0.002). Viral suppression rates were similar between the arms. The TB-HAART trial included 1,538 participants with HIV infection in South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania who had culture-confirmed pulmonary TB and CD4 counts 220 cells/mm 3 and had tolerated 2 weeks of TB treatment. Participants were randomized to early ART (initiated after 2 weeks of TB treatment) or delayed ART (until 6 months after initiation of TB treatment). 148 The median CD4 count for all participants was 367 cells/mm3 (IQR 289, 456). The composite primary endpoint of TB treatment failure, TB recurrence, and death within 12 months of starting TB treatment occurred in 8.5% of participants in the early ART group and 9.2% in the delayed ART group (relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI, 0.64-1.30; P = 0.9). Mortality rates and the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and IRIS did not differ among the treatment groups. Patients in the early ART group had higher CD4 counts at all time points than those in the delayed ART group; no data on viral suppression were available. Unlike SAPIT, STRIDE, and CAMELIA, the TB-HAART study concluded that ART can be delayed until after 6 months of TB treatment for patients with CD4 counts >220 cells/mm 3. The optimal approach for initiation of ART in TB meningitis remains uncertain. A randomized trial conducted in Vietnam compared ART initiation immediately (within 7 days of starting TB treatment) or until 2 months after starting TB treatment among 253 patients with HIV-related TB meningitis. 154 This study did not show a survival benefit to early ART initiation. On the contrary, mortality was similar in both study arms, and Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-12early ART was associated with more frequent and severe adverse events than deferred ART (86% vs. 75% of participants, respectively). The overall mortality rates in this study were very high (58%), likely at least in part because most participants had advanced AIDS (median baseline CD4 count was 41 cells/mm 3); it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other settings. Many experts would recommend the initiation of ART within the first 2 to 8 weeks of starting anti-TB treatment, opting for 2 weeks in those with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm 3 in settings where close monitoring of drug-related toxicities and CNS adverse events is feasible (AI). In conclusion, ART is recommended for all persons with HIV and TB (AI). For ART-naive patients, ART should be started within 2 weeks after TB treatment initiation in those with CD4 count <50 cells/mm 3 and, based on the preponderance of data, when TB meningitis is not suspected, within 8 weeks of starting anti-TB treatment in those with higher CD4 cell counts (AI). Given the need to initiate five to seven new medications in a short time, patients should be offered adherence support. Rifampin-associated drug interactions should be considered when selecting the ARV drug regimen. In patients with TB meningitis and low CD4 counts, early ART may pose a risk for severe adverse effects, and an expert should be consulted, and careful monitoring provided. Early ART initiation requires close collaboration between HIV and TB care clinics, expertise in management of ART regimen selection, close monitoring, and support and adherence services for clients. When TB occurs in patients already on ART, treatment for TB must be started immediately (AIII) , and ART should be modified to reduce the risk for drug interactions and maintain virologic suppression. When TB occurs in the setting of virologic failure, ART drug resistance testing should be performed, and intensified adherence counseling should be provided. A new ART regimen may be required to achieve virologic suppression and minimize drug interactions with the anti-TB regimen. Drug-Drug Interactions in the Treatment of HIV-Related TB The rifamycin class of antibiotics is the key to effective, short-course treatment for drug-sensitive TB. However, the currently available rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine) have clinically significant interactions with several ARV drugs and these interactions should be taken into consideration before initiating therapy (see Table 3 and the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). These drug-drug interactions are complex, but most result from the potent induction by the rifamycin of genes involved in the metabolism and transport of ARV agents. Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase together with rifampin-containing TB treatment without dose adjustment. The newer tenofovir formulation, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), is a substrate of drug transporters, including P-glycoprotein, and is more likely to have drug-drug interactions than TDF. A recent study conducted among healthy volunteers without HIV infection showed that concentrations of the active form of tenofovir, namely intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate, was higher with TAF/emtricitabine given with rifampicin than with TDF given alone, suggesting that TAF may be given together with rifampicin-containing TB treatment without dose adjustment. 155 Caution is urged, however, as this combination has not been tested in patients to confirm PK and virologic efficacy among patients taking full dose ART and TB regimens. Neither TDF nor TAF has been tested the regimen for HIV-related TB disease has been rifampin-based TB therapy with an ARV regimen of efavirenz plus two nucleoside(tide) analogues (AII). Efavirenz-based ART is associated with excellent TB and HIV treatment outcomes and has low rates of serious toxicity. 156 Data on the magnitude of the change in efavirenz concentrations when co-administered with rifampin are conflicting. Early studies, largely conducted among healthy individuals without HIV infection, reported a 26% reduction in efavirenz plasma concentrations with rifampin, 157 but more recent and larger studies in PLWH and TB (including patients with higher body weight) have not shown a significant effect of rifampin-containing TB treatment on efavirenz plasma concentrations in the majority of patients. 158-160 Previous recommendations to increase the dose of efavirenz, especially in patients weighing Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-13>60 kg, are thus not supported by high-quality data and have several disadvantages (complexity of dosing, inability to take advantage of the simplicity of the co-formulation of efavirenz, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine, and the possibility of increased neuropsychiatric side effects). A further disadvantage of increasing the dose of efavirenz coadministered with TB treatment is that slow metabolizers of efavirenz (about 20% of people of African, Thai, and Indian ancestry) who already have high efavirenz concentrations will have a further approximately 50% increase in efavirenz concentrations during TB treatment due to the inhibition by isoniazid of the accessory cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2A6. 161 Given the preponderance of data and the excellent treatment outcomes of co-treatment with standard-dose efavirenz,156,162 the 600 mg daily dose of efavirenz is recommended (AII). Although still used in international resource-limited settings, nevirapine is rarely used in high resourced settings, and is not recommended in these settings for HIV and TB co-treatment. Data from more recent studies indicate that in patients on TB therapy, co-treatment with nevirapine-based ART is associated with less satisfactory virologic outcomes and increased incidence of drug discontinuation due to adverse events than efavirenz-based ART. 163-165 Drug-drug interactions between rifampin and other NNRTIs have a more significant effect on the concentrations of the NNRTIs that limit their concomitant use. The use of rifampin or rifapentine with doravirine, etravirine or rilpivirine is not recommended (AIII) (see Table 3 and the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Substitution of rifabutin for rifampin with appropriate dose adjustment of rifabutin might be considered for patients who require one of these NNRTIs, however, these combinations have not been evaluated in PLWH requiring treatment for active TB disease. Integrase Inhibitors\u2014Bictegravir, Dolutegravir, Elvitegravir, and Raltegravir: Alternatives to based treatment for patients with HIV/TB include regimens with integrase inhibitors or protease inhibitors (PIs). One preferred alternative co-treatment regimen is the combination of raltegravir-based ART, using raltegravir 400 or 800 mg twice daily, with standard rifampin dosing (BI). 166 Raltegravir concentrations are significantly decreased when co-administered with rifampin. Increasing the dose of raltegravir to 800 mg twice daily mitigates this PK interaction. 167 The recently presented REFLATE TB2 trial compared efavirenz 600 mg daily to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily in PLWH undergoing TB treatment; the overall viral suppression rate at week 48 did not achieve the non-inferiority margin with this dose of raltegravir, although a previous Phase 2 randomized trial suggested virologic suppression was similar in non-comparative analyses of the raltegravir 400 and 800 mg twice daily arms. 166 These data suggest that the dose of raltegravir should be 800 mg twice daily if used with rifampin. Alternatively, raltegravir can be given with a rifabutin-containing TB regimen without dose adjustment of either drug. 168 Dolutegravir may be another reasonable treatment option. A PK study in healthy volunteers showed that increasing the dose of dolutegravir to 50 mg twice a day with rifampin resulted in similar exposure to dolutegravir dosed 50 mg daily without rifampin, and that rifabutin 300 mg daily did not significantly reduce the area under the concentration curve of dolutegravir. 169 A recent Phase 2 randomized, non-comparative trial (INSPIRING) was conducted among ART-naive patients with HIV-associated TB and investigated dolutegravir at a dose of 50 mg twice daily during and for 2 weeks after completing rifampin-containing TB treatment. Among the 69 patients randomized to the dolutegravir arm, the results at 24 weeks were favorable with on-target PK assessments and rapid virologic response; there were no deaths, no discontinuations for IRIS or drug toxicity, and no emergence of resistance. 170 Final 48-week data are expected in 2019. A recent trial conducted among healthy volunteers without HIV infection evaluated bictegravir concentrations when given twice daily together with rifampin versus once-daily alone. 171 Bictegravir trough concentrations, even with the dose adjustment, were reduced 80%. Thus, bictegravir should not be used together with rifamycin- containing TB treatment (AI). Similarly, elvitegravir/cobicistat should not be used together with TB treatment that contains rifamycins (AI). Protease Inhibitors with Rifampin or Rifabutin: Another alternative co-treatment regimen is rifabutin-based TB therapy with an ARV regimen including a ritonavir-boosted PI (BIII). While there are no clinical trials specifically comparing rifampin- and rifabutin-containing anti-TB regimens among persons with HIV/ Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-14TB taking ART, in general, rifabutin is regarded as a reasonable substitute for rifampin for treatment of TB.172,173 Although the dramatic effects of rifampin on serum concentrations of lopinavir may be overcome by doubling the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir,174,175 the safety of this strategy has yet to be firmly established. High rates of hepatotoxicity were reported when dose-adjusted ritonavir-boosted PIs were given with rifampin to healthy volunteers. 176-178 In patients with HIV and TB, double doses of lopinavir/ritonavir are reasonably well tolerated in those on rifampin-based TB treatment, but the strategy of increasing ritonavir dosing to 400 mg twice daily leads to high rates of hepatotoxicity. 175,179,180 Thus, a strategy of first increasing the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir by 50%, then increasing to full double dose is recommended (BIII). Regular monitoring of transaminases is recommended when double-dose lopinavir/ritonavir is used (e.g., more frequently initially, then monthly once transaminase levels are stable on full dose). Use of rifabutin with a boosted PI is thus preferred to use of rifampin with double-dose PI in settings where rifabutin is readily available. Co-administered rifabutin has little effect on ritonavir-boosted lopinavir 181 or atazanavir,182 and only moderately increases concentrations of ritonavir-boosted darunavir183 and fosamprenavir.184 However, all PIs markedly increase serum concentrations of rifabutin (and one of its principal active metabolites, 25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin). Therefore, the dose of rifabutin must be decreased to avoid dose-related toxicity, such as uveitis and neutropenia. 185 In studies of people with HIV infection, rifabutin exposures were significantly lower when rifabutin was dosed at 150 mg three times weekly with lopinavir/ritonavir than when dosed at 300 mg daily without a PI, but concentrations of the active desacetyl metabolite were high. 186,187 Among individuals with HIV/TB, there have been case reports of acquired rifamycin resistance with 150 mg three times weekly doses of rifabutin when co-administered with a boosted PI-based ARV regimen. 188,189 A recent study conducted in South Africa in 16 patients with HIV infection on a lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART regimen demonstrated that rifabutin administered at a dose of 150 mg daily in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir was generally safe and associated with rifabutin plasma concentrations similar to those shown to prevent acquired rifamycin resistance (i.e., rifabutin given 300 mg daily in the absence of a boosted PI). 187 A randomized clinical trial evaluating rifabutin PK and TB and ART outcomes using rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART has been completed and results are pending. Based on available PK data, it is recommended that rifabutin should be dosed 150 mg daily in patients who are on a ritonavir-boosted PI-containing antiretroviral regimen (BII). However, given that the risk of adverse events related to high levels of rifabutin's metabolite with this dosing strategy has not been firmly established, close monitoring for toxicity (especially neutropenia and uveitis) is required until larger studies provide adequate safety data. Close monitoring of adherence to ART is essential as these reduced doses of rifabutin would be inadequate if the patient stopped taking the PI, putting the patient at risk of rifamycin-resistant TB. The breadth and magnitude of drug-drug interactions between the rifamycins and many ARV drugs can be daunting. Nevertheless, every effort should be made to include a rifamycin in the TB treatment regimen; the drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and ARV drugs should be managed, not avoided. Rifamycins remain the most potent drug class for TB treatment, and regimens that included only 2 months of rifampin were associated with increased risks of treatment failure and TB recurrence among patients with HIV-related TB. 190,191 If a rifamycin cannot be used, TB treatment duration must be extended substantially. Thus, patients with rifamycin-susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates should only be treated with a regimen that does not contain a rifamycin when the patient has had a serious adverse event that is highly likely due to a rifamycin (AIII). Monitoring the Response to Therapy Patients with pulmonary TB should have monthly sputum smears and cultures performed to document culture conversion on therapy (defined as two consecutive negative cultures). Sputum cultures from patients with susceptible TB typically convert to negative by 2 months of first-line TB therapy, although sputum culture conversion to negative may take longer for patients with cavitary TB disease. 192 Sputum cultures that do not convert to negative at or after 4 months of therapy indicate treatment failure, and should prompt drug resistance testing of any available specimens. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-15Managing Suspected Treatment Failure The causes of treatment failure include undetected primary drug resistance, inadequate adherence to therapy, incorrect or inadequate regimen prescribed, subtherapeutic drug levels due to malabsorption, super-infection with drug-resistant M. tuberculosis, and acquired drug-resistance. Patients with suspected treatment failure should be evaluated with a history, physical exam, and chest radiograph to determine whether the patient has clinically responded to therapy, even though sputum culture conversion has not occurred. The initial culture results and drug-resistance tests, treatment regimen, and patient adherence to the regimen should also be reviewed. Some experts will perform therapeutic drug monitoring to determine if serum concentrations of the TB drugs are within expected ranges and dose adjust as necessary. 133,193 In addition, samples from all available sites (e.g., sputum, blood, urine) should be collected for repeat culture and drug-susceptibility testing, and strong consideration should be given to performing rapid resistance testing on direct specimens or positive cultures to identify acquired drug resistance or super-infection with a drug-resistant strain. While awaiting results of repeat cultures and rapid resistance testing, broadening empiric TB treatment with second-line TB drugs should be considered, in consultation with an expert in the field (BIII). Adverse Drug Reactions in TB Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy During the course of anti-TB therapy, patients with HIV who are not on ART are more likely to experience adverse events thought to be drug-related than patients without HIV . 194,195 Many adverse drug reactions are shared between ARVs and drugs used for anti-TB therapy. Retrospective observational studies reported an increased risk of adverse drug reactions in patients treated with concomitant ART and anti-TB therapy, 194 but two recent randomized controlled trials of ART initiated during or after anti-TB therapy reported similar rates of adverse events during anti-TB therapy with and without concomitant ART, suggesting no significant additive toxicity when ART is coadministered with anti-TB therapy. 147,148 However, managing suspected adverse drug reactions in this setting is complex, because assigning causality to individual drugs in patients on anti-TB drugs, ART, and other agents is very difficult. Because first-line anti-TB drugs are more effective and have fewer toxicities than alternative drugs, first- line drugs (especially isoniazid and rifampin or rifabutin) should not be stopped permanently unless there is strong evidence that a drug reaction was caused by a specific anti-TB drug. In such situations, decisions regarding rechallenge with first-line drugs and/or substitution of second-line drugs should be made in consultation with a specialist in treating TB disease in persons with HIV . Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can be caused by pyrazinamide, many ARV drugs, and cotrimoxazole. Anti-TB DILI is defined as an ALT elevation 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the presence of symptoms (e.g., fever, rash, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice), or 5 times the ULN in the absence of symptoms. An increase in ALT concentration occurs in approximately 5% to 30% of patients treated with the standard four-drug anti-TB regimen, 68,196 but many of these patients only have transient, mild elevations of ALT.68 If the criteria for anti-TB DILI are fulfilled, all potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be stopped, and the patient should be evaluated immediately. Serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C should be performed, and the patient should be questioned regarding symptoms suggestive of biliary tract disease and exposures to alcohol and other hepatotoxins. At least three anti-TB drugs should be started (e.g., ethambutol, an aminoglycoside, and moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) 197 as a \"bridging regimen\" until the specific cause of hepatotoxicity can be determined and an alternative longer-term regimen constructed (BIII). After the patient's ALT level returns to <2.5 times the ULN (or to near baseline for those with pre-existing abnormalities), a rechallenge with the hepatotoxic first-line anti-TB medications can be started by adding each drug individually to the bridging regimen at 7-day intervals. During the rechallenge, the patient's ALT levels should be monitored frequently. Rechallenge was successful in almost 90% of patients without HIV in one randomized controlled trial of different rechallenge regimens. 197 Because the rifamycins are a critical part of the TB regimen, they should be restarted first. Rechallenge with pyrazinamide is controversial Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-16because some studies have reported high rates of recurrent ALT elevations with reintroduction of the drug. However, some experts would recommend rechallenge with pyrazinamide in patients with severe forms of TB (e.g., meningitis or disseminated TB). 198 Depending on the outcome of the rechallenge, the anti-TB therapy regimen and duration may need to be altered, in which case, expert consultation is advised. After anti-TB drug rechallenge, if appropriate, relevant ARV drugs and cotrimoxazole may be restarted. Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) may occur with all of the first-line anti-TB drugs, notably rifampin and isoniazid; 199 many antiretroviral drugs, notably the NNRTIs; and cotrimoxazole. If the rash is minor, affects a limited area, and causes pruritus, antihistamines should be administered for symptomatic relief, and all anti-TB medications continued. If the rash is generalized, or associated with fever or DILI, or if there is mucous membrane involvement or desquamation, all anti-TB medications, relevant ARVs, and cotrimoxazole should be stopped. When the rash is substantially improved, the TB drug should be restarted as described in the section on DILI above. If the rash recurs, the last drug that had been added should be stopped and the TB regimen modified. Thereafter, if appropriate, relevant ARV drugs and cotrimoxazole may be recommenced. Managing Drug-Resistant TB Although drug-resistant TB represents a small fraction of the TB cases in the United States, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant TB globally, plus the high proportion of TB cases in the United States in people who are foreign-born, make it increasingly likely that local TB programs will be faced with this complex disease. The most active and effective TB drugs are those used in first-line TB treatment regimens (isoniazid and rifampin, in particular). When resistance to these medications develops, alternative combinations of first- and second-line TB medications must be used, but clinical trial data on their optimal use has not yet been published. Growing evidence demonstrates that there is an increased risk of treatment failure associated with baseline isoniazid monoresistance, 200 particularly in patients with HIV/TB.124 For patients with isoniazid monoresistance, it is recommended that a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) be substituted for isoniazid and given together with rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 6 months (BII). 201,202 Resistance to rifampin alone, or to rifampin and other drugs, substantially increases the complexity and duration of treatment. Treatment of these types of drug-resistant TB requires the use of second-line and often third-line TB medications, which are less effective, more toxic, and require 12 to 24 months of treatment. 203,204 Treatment outcomes for MDR TB are considerably worse than those for drug-susceptible TB\u2014especially in patients with HIV/TB.114 Consensus treatment guidelines for MDR TB are based on a review of published observational studies205,206 and recommend use of at least five drugs with known or likely activity against the patient's isolate (BIII). Until recently, such regimens retained susceptibility); and likely two other second-line oral medications, such as ethionamide or prothionamide, linezolid, cycloserine, or clofazimine. 203 Additional resistance to one or more of these drugs (e.g., extensively drug-resistant [XDR] TB) necessitated use of alternate or third-line agents with uncertain anti-TB activity. An intensive phase of 8 months was then followed by a continuation phase without the injectable agent for an additional 12 to 18 months. In addition to recommendations for an all-oral MDR TB regimen, in 2016, WHO also issued guidance for programs in resource-limited settings on a standardized shorter-course regimen that includes seven anti-TB drugs and a duration of 9 to 12 months of treatment for selected patients with MDR TB. 207 The regimen composition is based on combinations evaluated as \"the Bangladesh months, followed by moxifloxacin, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 5 months. Based on promising data from observational studies in predominantly persons without HIV , a randomized non-inferiority designed clinical trial (STREAM) recently compared the efficacy of an intensive, shortened, 9-month treatment regimen for MDR TB using currently available medications to the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-1720- to 24-month regimen. Recently published study results showed that the short-course regimen was non- inferior to the longer regimen (78.8% and 79.8% of participants with successful outcome for short- and long-term regimens, respectively). Notably, treatment outcomes in the 20- to 24-month treatment arm were considerably better than those historically reported (i.e., 54% treatment success). 209 Given the overall high success rate seen in both treatment arms, as well as the cost savings associated with the shorter regimen, WHO re-affirmed their recommendation of the short-course regimen. 210 Importantly, however, participants with HIV in the STREAM trial had more than double the risk of death compared to participants without HIV , and although this difference did not reach statistical significance, the study was not powered to detect such a difference among subgroups. This finding is particularly concerning, given that a recent observational study of patients in nine African countries receiving the short-course regimen found a statistically significantly higher mortality rate in patients with HIV than in patients without HIV . 211 Many resource-limited countries have adopted the short-course regimen in their national TB treatment programs, and variations of the shortened regimen are being evaluated in several randomized clinical trials, including in the United States. Adoption of this option may be important for patients with MDR TB who have confirmed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable agents. The field is in considerable flux as clinical trials of shorter course therapy with or without injectable agents are in progress. In late 2018, WHO issued MDR treatment guidelines recommending a fully oral regimen for most patients with rifampin-resistant TB. 212 The ranking of the second-line drugs was restructured, and bedaquiline, linezolid, and levofloxacin/moxifloxacin were placed in the highest tier (Group A), followed by clofazimine and cycloserine (Group B). All remaining drugs were placed in Group C, to complete the regimen only when drugs from Group A and B cannot be used. Notably, kanamycin and capreomycin are no longer recommended, given that the recent meta-analysis found an increased risk of treatment failure and relapse seen with their use. Such an association was not seen for amikacin, which may be used when other, less toxic drugs cannot be used, or in select patients eligible for the short-course regimen. Although the WHO updated recommendations are focused on crafting an initial standardized regimen in areas where access to rapid drug-susceptibility testing may be limited, based on these data and given the inordinate complexity of treatment for MDR- and XDR-TB, it is likely that these recommendations will be adopted in many countries while awaiting data from randomized clinical trials. The treatment of MDR TB in the United States is evolving. Bedaquiline was approved in the United States for treatment of MDR TB in 2012. Initial randomized trials showed an increased number of late-occurring, unexplained deaths among the relatively small number of patients who received bedaquiline in randomized trials 213 suggesting that this drug should be used with caution and only in patients without other MDR TB treatment options while awaiting additional studies,214 However, a meta-analysis of subsequent cohort studies that compared MDR TB regimens with and without bedaquiline showed improved survival in patients treated with regimens containing bedaquiline (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 95% CI, 0.41-0.61). 215 Although clinical experience with bedaquiline in the United States is still limited, experience outside the United States is rapidly expanding. Studies have revealed several important drug-drug interactions with common ARV agents. Specifically, efavirenz decreases bedaquiline levels and should not be used concurrently with bedaquiline. 216 Lopinavir/ritonavir, by contrast, increases bedaquiline plasma concentrations approximately two-fold when given at steady-state, but the clinical significance of this increase is not yet known.217,218 Delamanid, a new agent with a mechanism of action distinct from bedaquiline's, showed promise in early phase clinical trials. 219 Delamanid has been approved in Europe and Japan but currently is only available in the United States through a compassionate use program . A Phase 3 trial recently compared delamanid to placebo when given with an optimized background regimen to patients with MDR TB. Results of the trial showed no significant difference in treatment success with the addition of delamanid versus placebo (81% of participants in each arm). 220 However, participants in the placebo plus optimized background therapy arm had much higher rates of treatment success than expected. Given the favorable safety profile of delamanid and the high toxicity of other drugs in the background regimen, WHO reaffirmed their prior endorsement of delamanid with the caveat that it only be given as part of a longer (i.e., 20-24 month) treatment course and when a suitable regimen cannot be constructed without it. 221 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-18At present, there are insufficient data to support the use of WHO recommended shorter-course regimens in individuals with or without HIV in high-resource settings like the United States where full drug-susceptibility testing and individualized treatment options are available but this is likely to change in the near future. Whenever possible, treatment should be individualized based on a patient's specific drug-susceptibility testing results or treatment history. Surgical removal of TB lesions is a potential adjunctive measure in those with localized disease. 222 In the United States, treatment of MDR TB should involve an expert with experience in treating drug-resistant TB cases (if a local expert is not available, one option is to contact one of CDC's TB Centers of Excellence for Training, Education, and Medical Consultation ). Several medications for MDR TB carry considerable toxicity, including irreversible hearing loss, hypothyroidism, psychosis, and treatment-limiting gastrointestinal discomfort. Given the prolonged treatment course for MDR TB (20-24 months), patients and family members must be counseled ahead of time about possible side effects and the importance of treatment adherence. While on therapy, patients should be monitored closely for the appearance of side effects. Such screening should include serum chemistries, liver function tests, thyroid stimulating hormone, audiometry if treated with an injectable agent, and EKG monitoring if treated with bedaquiline. Sputum cultures should be performed monthly, even after culture conversion, so that any relapse and amplified resistance are detected early. As with drug-susceptible TB, patients with HIV with drug-resistant TB (other than meningitis) should start ART as soon as possible. Despite the considerable pill burden and potential for overlapping drug toxicities, several retrospective studies and a recent prospective cohort study from South Africa have demonstrated high treatment success rates and favorable HIV outcomes with concurrent treatment. 223,224 TB-Associated IRIS TB-IRIS is a frequent early complication of ART in patients with recently diagnosed or undiagnosed active TB. The condition is thought to result from the recovering immune system driving inflammatory reactions directed at M. tuberculosis antigen present at sites of disease. 225-227 TB-IRIS is characterized by excessive local or systemic inflammation. Two forms of TB-IRIS are recognized: paradoxical TB-IRIS and unmasking TB-IRIS. Proposed clinical case definitions syndromes have been published. 228 Paradoxical TB-IRIS Paradoxical TB-IRIS occurs in patients who are diagnosed with active TB prior to starting ART. Typically, these patients have had clinical improvement on TB treatment prior to starting ART. Within the first 1 to 4 weeks of ART (though sometimes later), they develop new or recurrent symptoms, as well as new, worsening, or recurrent clinical and radiologic features of TB. Common and important manifestations of paradoxical TB-IRIS include hectic fevers, new or enlarging lymphadenopathy, and new or worsening pulmonary infiltrates. Mortality due to paradoxical TB-IRIS is uncommon, pericardial effusions causing extensive pulmonary involvement with respiratory failure, nodal enlargement causing airway obstruction, and splenic rupture due to rapid enlargement. 226,230,231 In patients with disseminated TB, hepatic TB-IRIS is common. This manifests with nausea and vomiting, tender hepatic enlargement, cholestatic liver function derangement, and reveals a granulomatous hepatitis.234 Hepatic TB-IRIS may be difficult to differentiate from drug-induced liver injury. Paradoxical TB-IRIS is relatively common among patients starting ART while on TB treatment (incidence 48% to 54%). A recent meta-analysis of 40 studies reported a pooled incidence of TB-IRIS of 18% in adults with HIV-associated TB initiating ART, with death attributed to TB-IRIS in 2% of the cases. 235 The onset of paradoxical TB-IRIS symptoms is typically between 1 to 4 weeks after ART is initiated.236-241 The syndrome lasts for 2 to 3 months on average,230,242 but in some cases, symptoms may continue for months, and in rare cases, local manifestations may persist or recur over a year after onset.228,242,243 In such cases of prolonged TB-IRIS, manifestations usually include suppurative lymphadenitis and abscess formation. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-19The most consistently identified risk factors for paradoxical TB-IRIS are a low CD4 count at start of ART, especially a CD4 count <100 cells/mm3;239,244 high HIV viral load prior to ART;245,246 disseminated or extrapulmonary TB;230,238,240,244 and a short interval between starting TB treatment and initiating ART, particularly if ART is started within the first 1 to 2 months of TB treatment.230,237,239 Even though early ART increases the risk for TB-IRIS, ART should be started within 2 weeks of TB diagnosis in patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm 3, given that this reduces risk of AIDS progression and death.235 The diagnosis of paradoxical TB-IRIS may be challenging, and there is no definitive confirmatory test. Thus, diagnosis relies upon a characteristic clinical presentation: improvement of TB symptoms with treatment prior to ART, deterioration with inflammatory features of TB soon after starting ART, and demonstration of a response to ART (CD4 rise and/or HIV viral load reduction). In addition, and very importantly, diagnosis of paradoxical TB-IRIS requires investigations to exclude alternative causes for deterioration, particularly another OI or undetected TB drug resistance. 233 Managing Paradoxical TB-IRIS Most cases of paradoxical TB-IRIS are self-limiting. Many patients require symptomatic therapy (e.g., analgesia, anti-emetics), and if symptoms are significant, anti-inflammatory therapy is appropriate. One randomized, placebo-controlled trial among patients with moderately severe paradoxical TB-IRIS showed that treatment with prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) resulted in a reduction in a combined endpoint of days hospitalized plus outpatient therapeutic procedures. 247 Patients on prednisone experienced more rapid symptom and radiographic improvement. No reduction in mortality was demonstrated, but immediately life-threatening cases (e.g., those with neurological involvement) were excluded from this study. The above study, 247 observational data,231 and clinical trials that showed reduced mortality in patients presenting with TB meningitis who were treated with corticosteroids81 suggest that corticosteroids (either intravenous dexamethasone or oral prednisone) should be used when TB-IRIS involves the CNS (e.g., enlarging tuberculoma, new or recurrent meningeal inflammation) at the time of presentation. Among all patients who developed TB-IRIS in the study described above, 4 weeks of prednisone treatment was insufficient in a subset. In such instances, a more gradual tapering of steroids over 2 to 3 months is recommended (BIII). 247 Tapering of corticosteroids should be guided by repeated clinical assessment of symptoms. Corticosteroids should be avoided in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, as life-threatening exacerbations can occur. There are case reports of patients with steroid-refractory and prolonged IRIS responding to TNF-blockers or thalidomide. 248-250 Pre-emptive prednisone treatment has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of paradoxical TB-IRIS in a trial conducted in South Africa. 251 This study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 240 ART-naive adults at high risk of paradoxical TB-IRIS treated with prednisone (40 mg/day for 2 weeks then 20 mg/day for 2 weeks) or placebo started at the time of ART initiation. High risk was defined as starting ART within 30 days of TB treatment initiation and a CD4 count 100/mm 3. Exclusion criteria included rifampin resistance, neurological TB, Kaposi's sarcoma, hepatitis BsAg positive, and poor clinical response to TB treatment prior to ART. The incidence of TB-IRIS was 47% in the placebo arm and 33% in the prednisone arm (RR = 0.70, 95% CI, 0.51-0.96). The intervention was not associated with harm; there was no excess risk of malignancy or severe infections. Based on these study findings, pre-emptive prednisone therapy should be offered for high-risk patients, as defined in this study, with a CD4 count 100/mm 3 who are starting ART in the context of recently initiated anti-TB therapy, are responding well to TB therapy, and who do not have rifampin resistance, Kaposi's sarcoma, or active hepatitis B (BI). Some clinicians use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to provide symptomatic relief in patients with mild TB-IRIS (CIII) . Needle aspiration suppurative lymphadenitis may also provide symptom relief (CIII) . Repeated aspirations may be required as abscesses and effusions often re-accumulate. 230 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-20Unmasking TB-IRIS Unmasking TB-IRIS may occur in patients who have unrecognized TB (because TB is either oligo- symptomatic or it has eluded diagnosis) at the start of ART. These patients may present with a particularly accelerated and inflammatory presentation of TB in the first weeks of ART. 228 A common presentation is pulmonary TB with rapid symptom onset and clinical features similar to bacterial pneumonia with high fever, respiratory distress, sepsis syndrome, and consolidation on chest radiograph. 228,247,252-254 Focal inflammatory manifestations such as abscesses and lymphadenitis may also develop.255 In cases of unmasking TB-IRIS, the treatment should be standard TB treatment and, if the manifestations are life-threatening, adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is recommended, although there is no clinical trial evidence to support steroid use in this setting (BIII). Prevention of Recurrent TB Among patients receiving the same TB treatment regimen in the same setting, the risk of recurrent TB appears to be higher among those with HIV than among those without HIV . 256 In TB-endemic settings, much of the increased risk of recurrent TB appears to be due to the higher risk of re-infection with a new strain of M. tuberculosis, with subsequent rapid progression to TB disease. 257,258 In settings with low rates of TB, such as the United States, recurrent TB due to re-infection is uncommon, even among patients with HIV .259 Several interventions have been suggested to decrease the risk of recurrent TB among patients with HIV: longer TB treatment regimens, administering therapy daily throughout the course of induction and continuation phases, post-treatment isoniazid therapy, and use of ART. None of these interventions has been adequately evaluated in randomized trials in settings with low TB burdens. Post-treatment isoniazid (6-9 months of daily isoniazid therapy after the completion of standard multidrug therapy) has been shown to be effective in high-burden settings in which the risk of re-exposure is high, 260,261 suggesting that this intervention decreases the risk of re-infection. However, post-treatment isoniazid is not recommended in low-burden settings such as the United States. Given that ART reduces the risk of initially developing TB disease, it is likely that ART also decreases the risk of re-infection with TB. Special Considerations During Pregnancy Pregnant women with HIV infection who do not have documentation of a prior negative TB screening test result or who are at high risk for repeated or ongoing exposure to individuals with active TB disease should be tested for TB during pregnancy (AIII) . The frequency of anergy is not increased during pregnancy, and routine anergy testing in pregnant women with HIV is not recommended. 262-265 There are several studies examining the performance of the IGRAs for diagnosis of LTBI in pregnant women. In a study in pregnant women with HIV in Kenya, a positive IGRA result was associated with a 4.5-fold increased risk of developing active TB disease; in women with CD4 cell counts <250 cells/mm 3, a positive IGRA result was associated with a five-fold increased risk of maternal mortality or active TB disease and a three-fold increased risk of either active TB disease or mortality in infants. 266 Antenatal IGRA positivity has also been demonstrated to correlate with postpartum IGRA test positivity (i.e., TB infection) in women with HIV .267 In women without HIV , the test appears to perform well but cost issues for routine screening are an area of debate. 268 If LTBI is diagnosed during pregnancy and active TB disease has been ruled out, treatment with isoniazid should be delayed until after delivery (BI), given a recent clinical trial showing increased adverse pregnancy outcomes in women in high TB prevalence settings treated with isoniazid during pregnancy as compared to deferring to after delivery. 269 IPT is still recommended, however, for pregnant women whose close household contacts include a person with TB disease. Studies in individuals with HIV who are not receiving ART have been found to have a high risk of progression from LTBI to active TB disease (10% per year), and there is a high risk of maternal and infant mortality in pregnant women with HIV who have active TB disease. 270,271 However, the risk of progression from LTBI to active TB disease in individuals on ART is significantly decreased.272 Pregnant women with HIV should be receiving ART both for their own health and for prevention of perinatal transmission. The risk of isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity may be increased in Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-21pregnancy. While treatment with isoniazid should be delayed until after delivery, if the risk of progression to active TB disease is considered to outweigh the risk of adverse birth outcomes with isoniazid and isoniazid is prescribed, frequent monitoring is needed. 273 Pregnant women receiving isoniazid should receive daily pyridoxine supplementation as they are at risk of isoniazid-associated peripheral neuropathy.274 The diagnostic evaluation for TB disease in pregnant women is the same as for non-pregnant adults. Chest radiographs with abdominal shielding are recommended and result in minimal fetal radiation exposure. An increase in pregnancy complications and undesirable outcomes including preterm birth, low birthweight, and fetal growth restriction might be observed among pregnant women with either pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB not confined to the lymph nodes, especially when TB treatment is not begun until late in pregnancy. 262-265,275-278 Congenital TB infection has been reported, although it appears relatively uncommon.279-283 However, in one study of 107 women with active TB disease during pregnancy in South Africa, M. tuberculosis was detected in 16% of neonates (n = 16) tested within the first 3 weeks of life (12 by culture and 4 by smear microscopy).284 Treatment of TB disease for pregnant women should be the same as for non-pregnant women, but with attention to the following considerations (BIII): Although isoniazid is not teratogenic in animals or humans, hepatotoxicity caused by isoniazid might occur more frequently during pregnancy and the postpartum period.285 Monthly monitoring of liver transaminases during pregnancy and the postpartum period is recommended (CIII) . Rifampin is not teratogenic in humans. Ethambutol is teratogenic in rodents and rabbits at doses that are much higher than those used in humans. No evidence of teratogenicity has been observed in humans. Ocular toxicity has been reported in adults taking ethambutol, but changes in visual acuity have not been detected in infants exposed to ethambutol in utero . Pyrazinamide is not teratogenic in animals. Experience with its use in human pregnancy is limited. Although WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases286,287 have made recommendations for the routine use of pyrazinamide in pregnant women, pyrazinamide has not been recommended for general use during pregnancy in the United States because data characterizing its effects in this setting are limited. 288 If pyrazinamide is not included in the initial treatment regimen, the minimum duration of TB therapy should be 9 months (AII). The decision regarding whether to include pyrazinamide in treatment regimens for pregnant woman should be made after consultation among obstetricians, TB specialists, and patients, considering gestational age and likely susceptibility pattern of the woman's TB strain. Considering the information above, the preferred first-line treatment for drug-susceptible TB in pregnancy is isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol for a duration of 9 months. 204 Experience using the majority of the second-line drugs for TB during pregnancy is limited.289-292 MDR TB in pregnancy should be managed in consultation with a specialist. TB therapy should not be withheld because of pregnancy (AIII) . The following concerns should be considered when selecting second-line anti-TB drugs for use in pregnant women: Streptomycin use has been associated with a 10% rate of vestibulocochlear nerve toxicity in infants exposed to the drug in utero ; its use during pregnancy should be avoided if possible (AIII) . Hearing loss has been detected in approximately 2% of children exposed to long-term kanamycin therapy in utero ; like streptomycin, this agent should typically be avoided, if possible (AIII) . The fetus is at a theoretical risk for ototoxicity with in utero exposure to amikacin and capreomycin, but this risk has not been documented, and these drugs might be alternatives when an aminoglycoside is required for treatment of MDR TB (CIII) . Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-22 Because arthropathy has been noted in immature animals exposed to quinolones in utero , quinolones are typically not recommended for pregnant women or children aged <18 years (CIII) . However, studies evaluating quinolone use in pregnant women did not find an increased risk of birth defects or congenital musculoskeletal abnormalities.293,294 Thus, fluoroquinolones can be used in pregnancy for drug-resistant TB if they are required on the basis of susceptibility testing (CIII) .295 Para-aminosalicylic acid is not teratogenic in rats or rabbits.288 In one study, a possible increase in limb and ear anomalies was reported among 143 infants delivered by women who were exposed to para-aminosalicylic acid during the first trimester of pregnancy. 296 No specific pattern of defects and no increase in rate of defects have been detected in other human studies, indicating that this agent can be used with caution, if needed (CIII) . Ethionamide has been associated with an increased risk for several anomalies in rats after high-dose exposure but not in mice and rabbits. 297-299 Case reports have documented cases of CNS defects in humans but overall experience is limited with use during human pregnancy.300 Thus, ethionamide should be avoided unless its use is required on the basis of susceptibility testing (CIII) . No data are available from animal studies or reports of cycloserine use in humans during pregnancy . Recommendations for Treating Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Infection and Disease (page 1 of 3) Treating LTBI to Prevent TB Disease Indications: Positive screening testa for LTBI, no evidence of active TB disease, and no prior history of treatment for active disease or latent TB infection (AI); Close contact with a person with infectious TB, regardless of screening test result (AII) Preferred Therapy: Isoniazid 300 mg PO daily plus pyridoxine 25-50 mg PO daily (AI) Duration of Therapy: 9 months Alternative Therapies : Rifapentine (see weight-based dosing below) PO once weekly plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg PO once weekly (900 mg maximum) plus pyridoxine 50 mg PO once weekly for 12 weeks (AII). Note: Rifapentine is only recommended for patients receiving an efavirenz- or raltegravir-based ART regimen. Rifapentine W eekly Dose (maximum 900 mg) eighing 32.1-49.9 750 mg W eighing 50.0 kg: 900 mg Rifampin 600 mg PO daily for 4 months (BI) For persons exposed to drug-resistant TB, select anti-TB drugs after consultation with experts or with public health authoritie s (AII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-23Treating Active TB Disease After collecting specimen for culture and molecular diagnostic tests, empiric treatment should be initiated in persons with HIV with clinical and radiographic presentation suggestive of HIV-related TB (AIII). DOT is recommended for all patients requiring treatment for HIV -related TB (AII). Please refer to T able 3 (below) for TB drug dosing recommendations and to the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for dosing recommendations of ARV drugs when used with rifampin or rifabutin. For Drug-Sensitive TB Intensive or rifabutin) plus pyrazinamide plus ethambutol (AI) If drug susceptibility report shows sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin, then ethambutol may be discontinued.

Resistant to Isoniazid: (Moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) plus (rifampin or rifabutin) plus ethambutol pyrazinamide for months (BII) Resistant to Rifamycins plus/minus Other Antimycobacterial Agents: Therapy should be individualized based on drug susceptibility test results, clinical and microbiological responses, to include 5 active drugs, and with close consultation with experienced specialists (AIII). Duration: 12 to 24 months (see the Management of Drug-Resistant TB section above for discussion of shorter course therapy) Other Considerations in TB Management Adjunctive corticosteroid improves sur vival for patients with HIV-related TB involving the CNS (AI). Dexamethasone has been used CNS disease with the following dosing schedule: 0.3-0.4 mg/kg/day for 2-4 weeks, then taper 0.1 mg/kg per week until 0.1 mg/kg, then 4 mg per day and taper by 1 mg/week; total duration of 12 weeks. Despite the potential of drug-drug interactions, a rifamycin remains the most potent TB drug and should remain as part of the TB regimen unless a rifamycin-resistant isolate is detected, or the patient has a severe adverse effect that is likely due to the rifamycin (please refer to the table below and to the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for dosing recommendations involving concomitant use of rifampin or rifabutin and different ARV drugs). If NVP is to be added to the ARV regimen of a patient who is receiving RIF , the lead-in dose for NVP should be omitted. Intermittent rifamycins can result in development of resistance in patients with HIV and is not recommended (AI). Paradoxical reaction that is not severe may be treated symptomatically (CIII). For moderately severe paradoxical reaction, use of corticosteroid may be considered. T aper over 4 weeks (or longer) based on clinical symptoms (BIII).Recommendations for Treating Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Infection and Disease (page 2 of 3) Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV V-24Examples of Prednisone Dosing Strategies for IRIS In patients on a rifampin -based regimen: prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, then 0.75 mg/kg for 2 weeks In patients on a rifabutin plus boosted PI based regimen: prednisone 1.0 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, then 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks A more gradual tapering schedule over a few months may be necessar y in some patients.

Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents W-1Pneumocystis Pneumonia (Last updated March 28, 2019; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii , a ubiquitous fungus. The taxonomy of the organism has been changed; Pneumocystis carinii now refers only to the Pneumocystis that infects rats, and P. jirovecii refers to the distinct species that infects humans. However, the abbreviation PCP is still used to designate Pneumocystis pneumonia. Initial infection with P. jirovecii usually occurs in early childhood; two-thirds of healthy children have antibodies to P. jirovecii by age 2 years to 4 years.1 Rodent studies and case clusters in immunosuppressed patients suggest that Pneumocystis spreads by the airborne route. Disease probably occurs by new acquisition of infection and by reactivation of latent infection.2-11 Before the widespread use of PCP prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy (ART), PCP occurred in 70% to 80% of patients with AIDS;12 the course of treated PCP was associated with a 20% to 40% mortality rate in individuals with profound immunosuppression. Approximately 90% of PCP cases occurred in patients with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <200 cells/mm 3. Other factors associated with a higher risk of PCP in the pre-ART era included CD4 cell percentage <14%, previous episodes of PCP, oral thrush, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, unintentional weight loss, and higher plasma HIV RNA levels. 13,14 The incidence of PCP has declined substantially with widespread use of PCP prophylaxis and ART; recent incidence among patients with AIDS in Western Europe and the United States is <1 case per 100 person-years. 15-17 Most cases of PCP now occur in patients who are unaware of their HIV infection or are not receiving ongoing care for HIV ,18 and in those with advanced immunosuppression (i.e., CD4 counts <100 cells/mm3).19 Clinical Manifestations In patients with HIV , the most common manifestations of PCP are subacute onset of progressive dyspnea, fever, non-productive cough, and chest discomfort that worsens within days to weeks. The fulminant pneumonia observed in patients who do not have HIV is less common among patients with HIV . 20,21 In mild cases, pulmonary examination while the patient is at rest usually is normal. With exertion, tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse dry (cellophane) rales may be observed. 21 Oral thrush is a common co infection. Fever is apparent in most cases and may be the predominant symptom in some patients. Extrapulmonary disease is rare but can occur in any organ and has been associated with use of aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis. 22 Hypoxemia, the most characteristic laboratory abnormality, can range from mild (room air arterial oxygen [PO2] 70 mm Hg or alveolar-arterial PO 2 gradient [A-a] DO 2 <35 mm Hg) to moderate ([A-a] DO 2 35 to <45 mm Hg) to severe ([A-a] DO 2 45 mm Hg). Oxygen desaturation with exercise is often abnormal but is non-specific. 23 Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase levels to >500 mg/dL is common but also non- specific.24 The chest radiograph typically demonstrates diffuse, bilateral, symmetrical \"ground-glass\" interstitial infiltrates emanating from the hila in a butterfly pattern;21 however, in patients with early disease, a chest radiograph may be normal.25 Atypical radiographic presentations, and pneumothorax, also occur. Spontaneous pneumothorax in a patient with HIV infection should raise the suspicion of PCP. 26,27 Cavitation and pleural effusion are uncommon in the absence of other pulmonary pathogens or malignancy, and their presence may indicate an alternative diagnosis or an additional pathology. In fact, approximately 13% to 18% of patients with documented PCP have another concurrent cause of pulmonary dysfunction, such as tuberculosis (TB), Kaposi sarcoma, or bacterial is a useful adjunctive study, since even in patients with mild- Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-2to-moderate symptoms and a normal chest radiograph, a CT scan will be abnormal, demonstrating \"ground-glass\" attenuation that may be patchy, while a normal CT has a high negative predictive value.30,31 Diagnosis Because clinical presentation, blood tests, and chest radiographs are not pathognomonic for PCP (and because the organism cannot be cultivated routinely), histopathologic or cytopathologic demonstration of organisms in tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, or induced sputum samples 20,28,29,32 is required for a definitive diagnosis of PCP. Spontaneously expectorated sputum has low sensitivity for the diagnosis of PCP and should not be submitted to the laboratory to diagnose PCP. Giemsa, Diff-Quik, and Wright stains detect both the cystic and trophic forms of P. jirovecii but do the wall; Grocott-Gomori methenamine Gram-Weigert, cresyl violet, and toluidine the cyst wall. Some laboratories prefer direct immunofluorescent staining. The sensitivity and specificity of respiratory samples for PCP depend on the stain being used, the experience of the microbiologist or pathologist, the pathogen load, and specimen quality. Previous studies of stained respiratory tract samples obtained by various methods indicate the following relative diagnostic sensitivities: <50% to >90% for induced sputum, and 95% to 100% for open lung biopsy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an alternative method for diagnosing PCP. PCR is highly sensitive and specific for detecting Pneumocystis; however, PCR cannot reliably distinguish colonization from active disease, although higher organism loads as determined by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assays are likely to represent clinically significant disease. 33-35 1,3 -D-glucan (-glucan), which is a component of the cell wall of Pneumocystis cysts, is often elevated in patients with PCP. The sensitivity of the -glucan assay for diagnosis of PCP appears to be high, thus PCP is less likely in patients with a low level of -glucan (e.g., <80 pg/mL using the Fungitell assay). However, the specificity of -glucan testing for establishing a PCP diagnosis is low, 36-38 since many other fungal diseases, cellulose membranes used for hemodialysis, and some drugs can elevate -glucan levels. Because the clinical manifestations of several disease processes are similar, it is important to seek a definitive diagnosis of PCP disease rather than rely on a presumptive diagnosis, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. However, PCP treatment can be initiated before a definitive diagnosis is established because P. jirovecii persist in clinical specimens for days or weeks after effective therapy is initiated. 32 Preventing Exposure Pneumocystis can be quantified in the air near patients with PCP,39 and multiple outbreaks, each caused by a distinct strain of Pneumocystis, have been documented among kidney transplant patients.5-11,40 Although these findings strongly suggest that isolating patients with known PCP from patients at high risk for PCP may be beneficial, there are insufficient data to support isolation as standard practice to prevent PCP (CIII) . Preventing Disease Indication for Primary Prophylaxis Adults and adolescents with HIV , including pregnant women and those on ART, with CD4 counts <200 cells/ mm3 should receive chemoprophylaxis against Persons who have a CD4 cell percentage <14% should also be considered for PCP prophylaxis (BII).12,13,41 If ART initiation must be delayed and frequent monitoring of CD4 counts (e.g., every 3 months) is impossible, some experts recommend starting PCP chemoprophylaxis at CD4 counts 200 cells/mm 3 to 250 cells/mm3 (BII).13 Patients receiving pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine for treatment or suppression of toxoplasmosis do not require additional prophylaxis for PCP (AII). 42 (TMP-SMX) PCP (AI).41,43-45 One double-strength TMP-SMX tablet daily is the preferred regimen (AI), but one single-strength tablet Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-3daily45 is also effective and may be better tolerated than the double-strength tablet (AI). One double-strength TMP-SMX tablet three times weekly also is effective (BI).46 TMP-SMX at a dose of one double-strength tablet daily confers cross protection against toxoplasmosis47 and many respiratory bacterial infections.43,48 Lower doses of TMP-SMX may also confer such protection, potentially with less toxicity, though randomized controlled data addressing this possibility are unavailable. TMP-SMX chemoprophylaxis should be continued, when clinically feasible, in patients who have non life threatening adverse reactions. In those who discontinue TMP-SMX because of a mild adverse reaction, re-institution of the drug should be considered after the reaction has resolved (AII). Therapy should be permanently discontinued (with no rechallenge) in patients with life-threatening adverse reactions including possible or definite Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII) . Patients who have experienced adverse events, including fever and rash, may better tolerate re-introduction of TMP-SMX if the dose is gradually increased according to published regimens (BI) 49,50 or if the drug is given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII) . As many as 70% of patients can tolerate such re-institution of TMP-SMX therapy.48 For patients who Englewood, Colorado) (BI),44 is as effective as aerosolized pentamidine54 or dapsone55 but substantially more expensive than the other regimens. For patients seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX, recommended alternatives for prophylaxis against both PCP and toxoplasmosis dapsone plus pyrimethamine leucovorin without pyrimethamine, plus leucovorin (CIII). The following regimens cannot be recommended as alternatives to TMP-SMX because data regarding their efficacy for PCP prophylaxis are insufficient: Aerosolized pentamidine administered parenteral pentamidine Oral clindamycin primaquine Clinicians can consider using these agents, however , in situations in which TMP-SMX or the recommended alternative prophylactic regimens cannot be administered or are not tolerated (CIII) . Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis Primary Pneumocystis prophylaxis should be discontinued in adult and adolescent patients who have responded to ART with an increase in CD4 counts from <200 cells/mm3 to >200 cells/mm3 for >3 months (AI). In observational and randomized studies whose findings support this recommendation, most patients had CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3 for >3 months before discontinuing PCP prophylaxis.56-65 At of prophylaxis, the median CD4 count was >300 cells/mm3, most participants had a CD4 cell percentage 14%, and many had sustained suppression of HIV plasma RNA levels below detection limits for the assay employed. Median follow-up was 6 months to 19 months. Discontinuation of primary prophylaxis in patients with CD4 count increase to >200 cells/mm 3 as a result of ART is recommended because its preventive benefits against PCP, toxoplasmosis, and bacterial infections are limited;58,64 stopping the drugs reduces pill burden, cost, and the potential for drug toxicity, drug interactions, and selection of drug-resistant pathogens. Prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the decreases to <200 cells/mm 3 (AIII) . combined analysis of European cohorts,16,66 a small randomized trial,67 and a case series68 found a low incidence of PCP in patients with CD4 counts between 100 cells/mm3 and 200 cells/mm3, who were receiving ART and had HIV plasma viral loads <50 to 400 copies/mL, and who had stopped or never received PCP prophylaxis, suggesting that primary and secondary PCP prophylaxis can be safely discontinued in patients with CD4 counts between 100 cells/mm 3 to 200 cells/mm3 and HIV plasma RNA levels below limits of Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-4detection of commercial assays. Data on which to base specific recommendations are inadequate, but one approach would be to stop primary prophylaxis in patients with CD4 counts of 100 cells/mm3 to 200 cells/ mm3 if HIV plasma RNA levels remain below limits of detection for 3 months to 6 months (BII). Similar observations have been made with regard to stopping primary prophylaxis for Toxoplasma encephalitis.69 Treating Disease TMP-SMX is the treatment of choice for PCP (AI).70,71 Standard doses are summarized in the table; lower doses may also be effective, potentially with less toxicity, though randomized controlled data addressing this possibility are unavailable. The dose must be adjusted for abnormal renal function. Multiple randomized clinical trials indicate that TMP-SMX is as effective as parenteral pentamidine and more effective than other regimens for PCP treatment. Adding leucovorin to prevent myelosuppression during acute treatment is not recommended because efficacy in preventing this toxicity is questionable and some evidence exists for a higher failure rate in preventing PCP (AII). 72 Outpatient therapy with oral TMP-SMX is highly effective in patients with mild-to-moderate disease (AI).71 Mutations associated with resistance to sulfa drugs have been documented, but their effect on clinical outcome is uncertain. 73-76 Patients who have PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). Patients with documented or suspected PCP and moderate-to-severe disease, defined by room air PO 2 <70 mm Hg or PAO 2-PaO 2 35 mm Hg, should receive adjunctive corticosteroids as soon as possible and certainly within 72 hours after starting specific PCP therapy (AI).77-82 The benefits of starting steroids later are unclear, but most clinicians would administer them even after 72 hours for patients with moderate-to- severe disease (BIII). Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone at 75% of the corresponding oral prednisone dose can be used if parenteral administration is necessary. Alternative therapeutic regimens for mild-to-moderate disease include: dapsone and TMP (BI),71,83 which may have efficacy similar to TMP-SMX with fewer side effects, but is less convenient given the number of pills; clindamycin plus primaquine (BI)84-86 (clindamycin can be administered IV for more severe cases, but primaquine is only available in an oral formulation); and atovaquone suspension (BI),70,87 which is less effective than TMP-SMX for mild-to-moderate disease but has fewer side effects. Whenever possible, patients should be tested for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency before primaquine or dapsone is administered. Alternative therapeutic regimens for patients with moderate-to-severe disease include clindamycin- primaquine or IV pentamidine (AI). 86,88,89 Some clinicians prefer clindamycin plus primaquine because this combination is more effective and less toxic than pentamidine.86,90-92 Aerosolized pentamidine should not be used to treat PCP because it has limited efficacy and is associated with more frequent relapse (AI).88,93,94 The recommended duration of therapy for PCP (irrespective of regimen) is 21 days (AII).20 The probability and rate of response to therapy depend on the agent used, number of previous PCP episodes, severity of pulmonary illness, degree of immunodeficiency, timing of initiation of therapy, and comorbidities. Although overall the prognosis for patients with respiratory failure due to PCP is poor, over the past decades, survival for patients who require ICU care has improved as management of respiratory failure and HIV co-morbidities has improved. 95-98 Special attention is necessary regarding the use of ART in such critically ill patients.99 Special Consideration with Regards to Starting ART (Including IRIS) If not already started, ART should be initiated in patients, when possible, within 2 weeks of diagnosis of PCP (AI). In a randomized controlled trial of 282 patients with opportunistic infections (OIs) other than TB, Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-563% of whom had definite or presumptive PCP, the incidence of AIDS progression or death (a secondary study endpoint) was significantly lower among participants who initiated ART early than among those who delayed ART (median 12 days and 45 days after OI therapy initiation, respectively). 100 Of note, none of the participants with PCP enrolled in the study had respiratory failure requiring intubation;100 initiating ART in such patients is problematic given the lack of parenteral preparations and unpredictble absorption of oral medications, as well as potential drug interactions with agents commonly used in the ICU. 101 Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) following an episode of PCP is rare but has been reported. 102,103 Most cases occurred within weeks of the episode of PCP; symptoms included fever and recurrence or exacerbation of pulmonary symptoms including cough and shortness of breath, as well as worsening of a previously improving chest radiograph. Although IRIS in the setting of PCP has only rarely been life-threatening, 104 patients should be closely followed for recurrence of symptoms after initiation of ART. Management of PCP-associated IRIS is not well defined; some experts recommend use of corticosteroids in patients with respiratory deterioration if other causes are ruled out. Monitoring of Response to Pneumocystis Pneumonia Therapy and Adverse Events Careful monitoring during PCP therapy is important to evaluate response to treatment and to detect toxicity as soon as possible. Follow-up after therapy includes assessment for early relapse, especially if therapy has been with an agent other than TMP-SMX or was shortened because of toxicity. In patients with HIV , rates of adverse reaction to TMP-SMX are high (20% to 85% of patients). 70,71,83,85,89,105-109 Common adverse effects are rash (30% to 55% of patients) (including Stevens- Johnson syndrome), fever (30% to 40% of patients), leukopenia (1% to 5% of patients), hepatitis (20% of patients), and hyperkalemia. Supportive care for common adverse effects should be attempted before TMP-SMX is discontinued (AIII) . Rashes often can be \"treated through\" with antihistamines, nausea can be controlled with antiemetics, and fever can be managed with antipyretics. The most common adverse effects of alternative therapies include methemoglobinemia and hemolysis with dapsone or primaquine (especially in those rash dysrhythmia with pentamidine; 87-89,108 anemia, rash, fever, and diarrhea with primaquine and clindamycin;71,84,85 and headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, and transaminase elevations with atovaquone.70,107 Managing Treatment Failure Clinical failure is defined as lack of improvement or worsening of respiratory function documented by arterial blood gases after 4 days to 8 days of anti-PCP treatment. Failure attributed to lack of drug efficacy occurs in approximately 10% of patients with mild-to-moderate PCP disease. However, there are not any convincing clinical trial data on which to base recommendations for the management of PCP treatment failure due lack of drug efficacy. Clinicians should wait 4 days to 8 days before switching therapy for lack of clinical improvement (BIII). In the absence of corticosteroid therapy, early and reversible deterioration within the first 3 days to 5 days of therapy is typical, probably because of the inflammatory response caused by antibiotic-induced lysis of organisms in the lung. Other concomitant infections must be excluded as a cause of clinical failure; 28,29 bronchoscopy with BAL should be strongly considered to evaluate for this possibility, even if the procedure was conducted before initiating therapy. Treatment failure attributed to treatment-limiting toxicities occurs in up to one-third of patients. 71 Switching to another regimen is the appropriate management for treatment-related toxicity (BII). When TMP-SMX is not effective or cannot be used for moderate-to-severe disease because of toxicity, the common practice is to use parenteral pentamidine or oral primaquine combined with IV clindamycin (BII).85,86,89 For mild disease, atovaquone is a reasonable alternative (BII). Although a meta-analysis, systematic review, and cohort study Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-6concluded that the combination of clindamycin and primaquine might be the most effective regimen for salvage therapy,86,91,92 no prospective clinical trials have evaluated the optimal approach for patients who experience a therapy failure with TMP-SMX. Preventing Recurrence When to Start Secondary Prophylaxis Secondary PCP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX should be initiated immediately upon successful completion of PCP therapy and maintained until immune reconstitution occurs as a result of ART (see below) (AI).110 For patients who are intolerant of TMP-SMX, the alternatives are dapsone, dapsone plus pyrimethamine plus to Stop Secondary Prophylaxis Secondary prophylaxis should be discontinued in adult and adolescent patients whose CD4 counts have increased from <200 cells/mm 3 to >200 cells/mm3 for >3 months as a result of ART (AII). Reports from observational studies57,63,111,112 and from two randomized trials64,113 and a combined analysis of European cohorts being followed prospectively66,114 support this recommendation. In these studies, patients responded to ART with an increase in CD4 counts to 200 cells/mm3 for >3 months. At the time secondary PCP prophylaxis was discontinued, the median CD4 count was >300 cells/mm3 and most patients had a CD4 cell percentage >14%. Most patients had sustained suppression of plasma HIV RNA levels below the limits of detection for the assay employed; the longest follow-up was 40 months. Based on results from the COHERE study, secondary prophylaxis in patients with CD4 counts of 100 cells/mm 3 to 200 cells/mm3 can potentially be discontinued if HIV plasma RNA levels remain below limits of detection for 3 months to 6 months (BII).66 When to Restart Primary or Secondary Prophylaxis Primary or secondary PCP prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the patient's CD4 count decreases to <100 cells/mm 3 (AIII) regardless of the HIV plasma viral load. Prophylaxis should also be reintroduced for patients with CD4 counts of 100 cells/mm3 to 200 cells/mm3 with HIV plasma viral load above detection limits of the assay used (AIII) . Based on results from the COHERE study, primary or secondary PCP prophylaxis may not need to be restarted in patients with CD4 counts of 100 cells/mm3 to 200 cells/mm3 who have had HIV plasma RNA levels below limits of detection for 3 to 6 months (BII).16,66 If an episode of PCP occurs at a CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 while a patient is on ART, it would be prudent for the patient to continue PCP prophylaxis for life, regardless of how high their CD4 cell count rises as a consequence of ART (BIII). For patients in whom PCP occurs at a CD4 count >200 cells/mm 3 while not on ART, discontinuation of prophylaxis can be considered once HIV plasma RNA levels are suppressed to below limits of detection for 3 to 6 months, although there are no data to support recommendations in this setting (CIII) . Special Considerations During Pregnancy PCP diagnostic considerations for pregnant women are the same as for women who are not pregnant. Indications for PCP therapy are the same for pregnant women as for non-pregnant women. Some data suggest an increased risk of PCP-associated mortality in pregnancy, although there are no large, well-controlled studies evaluating the impact of pregnancy on PCP outcomes. 115 The preferred initial therapy for PCP during pregnancy is TMP-SMX, although alternate therapies can be used if patients are unable to tolerate or are unresponsive to TMP-SMX (AI). 116 In case-control studies, trimethoprim has been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects and cardiovascular, urinary tract, and multiple anomalies after first-trimester exposure. 117-119 One small study reported an increased risk of birth defects in infants born to women receiving antiretrovirals and folate antagonists, primarily Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-7trimethoprim; by contrast, no such increase was observed among infants exposed to either an antiretroviral or a folate antagonist alone.120 Although a small increased risk of birth defects may be associated with first- trimester exposure to trimethoprim, women in their first trimester with PCP still should be treated with TMP-SMX because of its considerable benefit (AIII) . Although folic acid supplementation at 0.4 mg/day is routinely recommended for all pregnant women, 121 there are no trials evaluating whether supplementation at higher levels (e.g., 4 mg/day as recommended for pregnant women who previously had an infant with a neural tube defect) would reduce the risk of birth defects associated with first-trimester TMP-SMX use in women with HIV . Epidemiologic data suggest that folic acid supplementation may reduce the risk of congenital anomalies. 118,119 In a large, population-based, case-control study, the increased odds of congenital cardiovascular anomalies associated with TMP-SMX use in pregnancy were not seen in women also receiving folic acid supplementation, most of whom received folic acid 6 mg/day (odds ratio [OR] 1.24; 95% CI, 0.94-1.62). 117 Although the risk of multiple congenital abnormalities associated with TMP-SMX use persisted despite supplemental folic acid, the OR decreased from 6.4 for TMP-SMX without folic acid to 1.9 for TMP-SMX plus folic acid. On the basis of these findings, clinicians can consider giving supplemental folic acid (>0.4 mg/day routinely recommended) to women in their first trimester who are on TMP-SMX (BIII). On the other hand, a randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that adding folinic acid to TMP-SMX treatment for PCP was associated with an increased risk of therapeutic failure and death. 72 In addition, there are case reports of failure of TMP-SMX prophylaxis in the setting of concurrent folinic acid use. 122 Therefore, if supplemental folic acid (>0.4 mg/day routinely recommended) is given, its use should be limited to the first trimester during the teratogenic window (AIII) . Whether a woman receives supplemental folic acid during the first trimester, a follow-up ultrasound is recommended at 18 weeks to 20 weeks to assess fetal anatomy (BIII). A randomized, controlled trial published in 1956 found that premature infants receiving prophylactic penicillin/sulfisoxazole were at significantly higher risk of mortality, specifically kernicterus, than infants who received oxytetracycline. 123 Because of these findings, some clinicians are concerned about the risk of neonatal kernicterus in the setting of maternal sulfonamide or dapsone use near delivery, although no published studies to date link late third-trimester exposure to either drug with neonatal death or kernicterus. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy should be used to improve the mother's treatment outcome as indicated in non-pregnant adults (AIII). 124-127 Patients with documented or suspected PCP and moderate-to-severe disease, as defined by room air PO 2 <70 mm Hg or PAO 2 - PaO 2 >35 mm Hg, should receive adjunctive corticosteroids as early as possible. A systematic review of case-control studies evaluating women with first-trimester exposure to corticosteroids found a 3.4 increased odds of delivering a baby with a cleft palate. 128 On the other hand, other large population-based studies have not found an association between maternal use of corticosteroids and congenital anomalies. 129,130 Corticosteroid use in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of maternal hypertension, glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes, and infection.131 Maternal glucose levels should be monitored closely when corticosteroids are used in the third trimester because the risk of glucose intolerance is increased (AIII). Moreover, women receiving 20 mg/day of prednisone (or its dosing equivalent for other exogenous corticosteroids) for >3 weeks may have hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and use of stress-dose corticosteroids during delivery should be considered (BIII). HPA axis suppression is rarely seen among neonates born to women who received chronic corticosteroids during pregnancy. Alternative therapeutic regimens for mild-to-moderate dapsone Dapsone to cross the placenta. 132,133 For several decades, dapsone has been used safely to treat leprosy, malaria, and various dermatologic conditions during pregnancy.133,134 Long-term therapy is associated with a risk of mild maternal hemolysis, and exposed fetuses with G6PD deficiency are at potential risk (albeit extremely low) of acute hemolytic anemia.135 Clindamycin, which appears to cross the placenta, is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Category B medication and is considered safe for use throughout pregnancy. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-8Primaquine generally is not used in pregnancy because of the risk of maternal hemolysis. As with dapsone, there is potential risk of hemolytic anemia in a primaquine-exposed fetus with G6PD deficiency. The degree of intravascular hemolysis appears to be associated with both dose of primaquine and severity of G6PD deficiency. 136 Data on atovaquone in human pregnancy are limited but preclinical studies have not demonstrated toxicity.136 Pentamidine is embryotoxic but not teratogenic in rats and rabbits.137 All-cause pneumonia during pregnancy increases rates of preterm labor and delivery. Women at >20 weeks gestation who have with pneumonia should be closely monitored for evidence of contractions (BIII). Chemoprophylaxis for PCP should be administered to pregnant women as for non-pregnant adults and adolescents (AIII) . TMP-SMX is the recommended prophylactic agent. Given theoretical concerns about possible teratogenicity associated with first-trimester drug exposures, health care providers may consider using alternative prophylactic regimens such as aerosolized pentamidine or oral first-trimester (CIII) rather than withholding chemoprophylaxis. Preconception Care Clinicians who are providing pre-conception care for women with HIV receiving PCP prophylaxis can discuss with their patients the option of deferring pregnancy until PCP prophylaxis can be safely discontinued (i.e., CD4 cell count >200 cells/mm 3 for 3 months) (BIII). Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Pneumocystis Pneumonia Preventing First Episode of PCP (Primary Prophylaxis) Indications for Initiating Primary Prophylaxis: or CD4 count >200 cells/mm3, but <250 cells/mm3 if ART initiation must be delayed and if CD4 count monitoring (e.g., every 3 months) is not possible (BII). Note: Patients who are receiving pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine for treatment or suppression of toxoplasmosis do not require additional prophylaxis for PCP (AII). Preferred Therapy: TMP-SMX, 1 DS tablet PO dailya (AI) or TMP-SMX, 1 SS tablet PO dailya (AI) Alternative Therapy: TMP-SMX 1 DS tablet PO three times weekly (BI) or Dapsone b,c 100 mg PO daily or dapsone 50 mg PO twice a day (BI) or Dapsoneb 50 mg PO daily with (pyrimethamine 50 mg plus leucovorin 25 mg) PO weekly (BI) or (Dapsoneb 200 mg plus pyrimethamine 75 mg plus leucovorin 25 mg) PO weekly (BI) or Aerosolized pentamidinec 300 mg via Respigard II nebulizer every month (BI) or Atovaquone 1500 mg PO daily with food (BI) or (Atovaquone 1500 mg plus pyrimethamine 25 mg plus leucovorin 10 mg) PO daily with food (CIII). Indication for Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis: CD4 count increased from <200 cells/mm 3 to 200 cells/mm3 for 3 months in response to ART (AI) Can consider when CD4 count is 100-200 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA remains below limit of detection of the assay used for 3 months to 6 months (BII) Indication for Restarting Primary Prophylaxis: CD4 count <100 cells/mm 3 regardless of HIV RNA (AIII) CD4 count 100-200 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA above detection limit of the assay used (AIII) Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-9Treating PCP Note: Patients who develop PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). For Moderate to Severe PCP: Total Duration of Treatment is 21 Days (AII) Preferred Therapy: TMP-SMX: (TMP 15-20 mg and SMX 75-100 mg)/kg/day IV given ever y 6 or 8 hours (AI), may switch to PO formulations after clinical improvement (AI). Alternative Therapy: Pentamidine 4 mg/kg IV once daily infused over 60 minutes (AI); may reduce the dose to pentamidine 3 mg/kg IV once daily in the event of toxicities (BI), or Primaquineb 30 mg (base) PO once daily plus (Clindamycin [IV 600 mg every 6 hours or 900 mg every 8 hours] or [PO 450 mg every 6 hours or 600 mg every 8 hours]) (AI). Note: Adjunctive corticosteroids are indicated in moderate to severe cases of PCP (see indications and dosage recommendations below). For Mild to Moderate PCP: Total Duration of Treatment is 21 Days (AII) TMP-SMX: (TMP 15-20 mg/kg/day and divided doses) (AI), or TMP-SMX 2 DS tablets PO three times daily (AI) Alternative Therapy: Dapsoneb 100 mg PO daily plus TMP 15 mg/kg/day PO (3 divided doses) (BI) or Primaquineb 30 mg (base) PO daily plus Clindamycin PO (450 mg every 6 hours or 600 mg every 8 hours) (BI) or Atovaquone 750 mg PO twice daily with food (BI) Adjunctive Corticosteroids For Moderate to Severe PCP Based on the Following Criteria (AI): PaO2 <70 mmHg mmHg Dosing Schedule: Prednisone doses (beginning as soon as possible and within 72 hours of PCP therapy) (AI) Days 1-5: 40 mg PO twice daily Days 6-10: 40 mg PO daily Days 11-21: 20 mg PO daily IV methylprednisolone can be given as 75% of prednisone dose. Preventing Subsequent Episode of PCP (Secondary Prophylaxis) Indications for Initiating Secondary Prophylaxis: Prior PCPPreferred Therapy: TMP-SMX, 1 DS tablet PO daily a (AI) or TMP-SMX, 1 SS tablet PO dailya (AI) Alternative Therapy: TMP-SMX 1 DS tablet PO three times weekly (BI) or Dapsoneb,c 100 mg PO daily (BI) or Dapsone 50 mg PO twice daily (BI) or Dapsoneb 50 mg PO daily with (pyrimethamine 50 mg plus leucovorin 25 mg) PO weekly (BI) or (Dapsoneb 200 mg plus pyrimethamine 75 mg plus leucovorin 25 mg) PO weekly (BI) or Aerosolized pentamidinec 300 mg via Respigard II nebulizer every month (BI) or Atovaquone 1500 mg PO daily with food (BI) or Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV W-10a TMP-SMX DS once daily also confers protection against toxoplasmosis and many respirator y bacterial infections; a lower dose also likely confers protection. b Whenever possible, patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency before administration of dapsone or primaquine. An alternative agent should be used if the patient is found to have G6PD deficiency. c Aerosolized pentamidine or dapsone (without pyrimethamine) should not be used for PCP prophylaxis in patients who are seropositive for PCP pneumonia; TMP-SMX = (Atovaquone 1500 mg plus pyrimethamine 25 mg plus leucovorin 10 mg) PO daily with food (CIII) Indications for Discontinuing Secondary Prophylaxis: CD4 count increased from <200 cells/mm3 to >200 cells/mm3 for >3 months as a result of ART (BII) or Can consider if CD4 count is 100-200 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA remains below limits of detection of assay used for 3 months to 6 months (BII) For patients in whom PCP occurs at a CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 while not on ART, discontinuation of prophylaxis can be considered once HIV RNA levels are suppressed to below limits of detection of the assay used for 3 months to 6 months, although there are no data to support recommendations in this setting (CIII). Note: If an episode of PCP occurs at a CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 while a patient is on ART, it would be prudent to continue PCP prophylaxis for life, regardless of how high the CD4 cell count rises as a consequence of ART (BIII). Indications for Restarting Secondary Prophylaxis: CD4 count <100 of HIV RNA (AIII) CD4 count 100-200 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA above detection limit of the assay used (AIII). Other Considerations/Comments: For patients with non-life-threatening adverse reactions to TMP-SMX, the drug should be continued if clinically feasible. If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, re-institution of therapy should be considered after the react ion has resolved (AII). The dose of TMP-SMX can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI) or the drug can be given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII). Therapy should be permanently discontinued, with no rechallenge, in patients with suspected or confirmed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). References 1. Woods D.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV X-1Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy/JC Virus Infection (Last updated November 13, 2018; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Epidemiology Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS), caused by the polyoma virus JC virus (JCV) and characterized by focal demyelination.1,2 The virus has worldwide distribution, with a seroprevalence of 39% to 69% among adults.3-6 Primary JCV infection usually occurs asymptomatically in childhood resulting in a chronic asymptomatic carrier state in most individuals. Viral DNA is detected in 20% to 30% of immunoliogically normal adults' urine. 4,7-11 Outside the context of HIV infection, PML is rare and characteristically manifests as a complication of other immunocompromising diseases or therapies. 12-14 In recent years, PML has been reported in patients treated with immunomodulatory humanized antibodies, including natalizumab,15 efalizumab,16,17 and rituximab.18 Concern has been raised about a possible increased risk of PML in HIV-infected patients treated with rituximab for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 19,20 but no reports have yet documented PML in that setting. Chronic immunosuppression after organ transplantation is occasionally complicated by PML with a very guarded prognosis. 21 Before the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), PML developed in 3% to 7% of patients with AIDS 22-24 and was almost invariably fatal; spontaneous remissions were rare.25 With the widespread use of ART in the developed world, incidence of PML has decreased substantially,26,27 and mortality in HIV-infected persons who develop the disease has declined.28-30 Although most CNS opportunistic infections are almost wholly prevented when CD4 T-lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts are maintained above 100 to 200 cells/mm3 PML can still sometimes occur in patients treated effectively with ART.2,31,32 PML can also develop in the setting of initiating ART and immune reconstitution, discussed below.2,30,33 Clinical Manifestations PML manifests as focal neurological deficits, usually with insidious onset and steady progression. Because the demyelinating lesions can involve different brain regions, specific deficits vary from patient to patient. Any region of the CNS can be involved, although some areas seem to be more favored, including the occipital lobes (with hemianopsia), frontal deep white matter (dysmetria and ataxia). 12 Spinal cord involvement is rare and the optic nerves are not involved.34 Although lesions can be multiple, one is often clinically predominant. Initial symptoms and signs usually begin as partial deficits (e.g., weakness in one leg) that worsen over time and involve a larger territory (e.g., evolution to hemiparesis) as individual lesions expand concentrically or along white matter tracts. The focal or multifocal nature of the pathology is responsible for the consistency of clinical presentations with distinct focal symptoms and signs, rather than as a more diffuse encephalopathy, or isolated dementia or behavioral syndrome, all of which are uncommon without concomitant focal findings. 35 The time course of this evolving demyelination, with clinical progression over several weeks, often provides a clue to diagnosis because the other major opportunistic focal brain disorders (cerebral toxoplasmosis and primary CNS lymphoma) characteristically progress in hours to days and cerebral infarcts begin even more abruptly. Nonetheless, PML is sometimes mistaken for an evolving stroke, which like PML is bright on diffusion weighted MRI. While rather sudden onset of a focal brain lesion can mimic strokes, the gradually progressive course should rapidly make this diagnosis unlikely with subsequent diagnostic evaluations undertaken to identify PML. Headache and fever are not characteristic of the disease, and when present may indicate presence of another opportunistic infection. Seizures develop in nearly 20% of PML patients and are associated with lesions immediately adjacent to the cortex. 36,37 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV X-2Diagnosis Initial recognition of PML relies on a combination of clinical and neuroimaging findings: steady progression of focal neurological deficits with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) almost always demonstrating distinct white matter lesions in areas of the brain corresponding to the clinical deficits. The lesions are hyperintense (white) on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery hypointense (dark) on T1-weighted sequences. 2 The T1 findings can be subtle and help distinguish lesions due to PML from other pathologies, including the white matter lesions of HIV encephalitis. In contrast to cerebral toxoplasmosis and primary CNS lymphoma, no mass effect or displacement of normal structures is usually evident. Although contrast enhancement is present in 10% to 15% of cases, it is usually sparse with a thin or reticulated appearance adjacent to the edge of the lesions. Exceptions to these characteristic imaging findings can occur when the inflammatory form of PML develops in the setting of immune reconstitution after initiation of ART (see below). Advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging and magenetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, may provide additional diagnostic information. 38-40 New PML lesions and the advancing edge of large lesions have high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging and normal-to-low apparent diffusion coefficient signifying restricted diffusion. These changes relate to regions of active infection and oligodendrocyte swelling. MR spectroscopy can show areas of decreased N-acetylaspartate and increased choline related to axonal loss and cell membrane and myelin breakdown, respectively, with the greatest changes at the center of lesions. 41 Recently, a hyperintense cortical signal seen on MRI scan in non-enhanced T1-weighted cortex images has been associated with seizures complicating inflammatory PML.37 In most cases of PML, the combined clinical and radiographic presentations support a presumptive diagnosis. Confirming the diagnosis, however, is invaluable. Certainly for atypical cases but even for typical cases, confirmation allows physicians to initiate ART rapidly and with certainty and prevents the need to revisit the diagnosis when disease progression continues. Confirmed diagnosis also informs discussions of prognosis. The usual first step in confirming the diagnosis is to test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of JCV DNA. The assay is positive in approximately 70% to 90% of patients not taking ART, for whom a positive result can be considered diagnostic in the appropriate clinical context, namely, subacute onset of focal neurological abnormalities and suggestive imaging findings. 9,42 JCV may be detectable in the CSF of as few as 60% of ART-treated patients.43 In patients not taking ART, the number of JCV DNA copies can add additional information for prognosis, although the relationship between copy number and prognosis is less clear in patients taking ART. 44,45 CSF analysis can be repeated if JCV PCR is negative yet suspicion of PML remains high and alternative diagnoses have been excluded (e.g., by PCR analyses of CSF for varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr for varicella and primary CNS lymphoma, respectively). Because JCV DNA viral load in CSF may be very low even with active PML, highly sensitive PCR performance is desirable. Sensitive assays that detect as few as 50 copies/ml are now available, with some research labs exceeding this level of sensitivity., detection of JCV virus in CSF in any amount with the appropriate clinical and imaging findings strongly supports the diagnosis of PML. 46 Analysis of plasma samples for detection of JCV by PCR when positive are relatively specific for PML (~92% in HIV patients), while the sensitivity is less than 40% in this setting.47 In some instances, brain biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis. PML can usually be identified by the characteristic tissue cytopathology, including oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusions, bizarre astrocytes, and with of JCV or cross reacting polyoma virus by immunohistochemistry, in situ nucleic acid hybridization, or electron microscopy. 12,48,49 Serologic testing is generally not useful because of high anti-JCV seroprevalence in the general population. Recently, however, antibody testing has been assessed for stratifying risk of PML with natalizumab treatment. 6 Significant increases in JC virus specific antibody titers50 and detection of intrathecally produced anti-JCV antibodies may prove useful for diagnostic testing51 but requires further prospective study. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV X-3Preventing Exposure JCV has a worldwide distribution and, as previously noted, 20% to 60% of people exhibit serologic evidence of exposure by their late teens.52 Currently, there is no known way to prevent exposure to the virus. Preventing Disease In many individuals, JCV infection is likely latent and intermittently productive, although clinically silent, in the kidney or other systemic sites. Systemic infection may increase in the presence of immunosuppression. It remains a subject of debate whether JCV infection is also latent in the CNS or whether PML results from hematogenous dissemination of infection to the brain resulting in subsequent PML lesion development within months of entry to CNS. 53,54 Protection is conferred by either preventing spread to the CNS or by preventing active viral replication with effective immunosurveillance. Therefore, the only effective way to prevent disease is to prevent progression of HIV-related immunosuppression with ART (AII). Treating Disease No specific therapy exists for JCV infection or PML. The main approach to treatment involves ART to reverse the immunosuppression that interferes with the normal host response to this virus. In patients with PML who are not on therapy, ART should be started immediately (AII). In this setting, more than half of HIV-infected PML patients experience a remission in which disease progression stops. Neurological deficits often persist, but some patients experience clinical improvement. 28,29,55-60 In one retrospective study of 118 consecutive patients with PML who received ART, 75 patients (63.6%) survived for a median of 114 weeks (2.2 years) after diagnosis of PML. 60 Neurological function in the survivors was categorized as cure or improvement in 33, stabilization or worsening in 40, and unknown in 2. Another retrospective case series reported that 42% of PML survivors on ART had moderate-to-severe disability. 61 Peripheral blood CD4 cell count at presentation was the only variable that predicted survival; the odds ratio for death was 2.7 among patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/mm 3 compared with patients who had higher CD4 cell counts. In other case series, worse prognosis was also associated with high plasma HIV RNA levels at the time of presentation, poor virologic responses to ART, and the presence of lesions in the brain stem. 29,32,56,57,59,60,62 Contrast enhancement on imaging may predict better outcome, as it is indicative of an immune response to the virus. 31 In PML occurring in multiple sclerosis patients, younger age, more restricted unilobar disease, and lower CSF JCV DNA copy numbers are associated with better outcomes.63 ART should be optimized for HIV virologic suppression in patients with PML who have received ART but remain viremic because of inadequate adherence or ARV resistance (AIII) . More problematic are patients who develop PML despite successful HIV virologic suppression while taking ART. A preliminary report of PML patients treated intensively with four classes of ART (including enfuvirtide) suggested that the strategy might offer higher than anticipated survival,64 but it has not yet been followed by a full report or structured trial. Therefore, there is no evidence supporting ART intensification for PML. The use of ARV drugs that better penetrate the CNS also has been proposed, with use of the CNS Penetration Effectiveness (CPE) score of drug regimens as a guide. This score is based on the pharmacology of ARV drugs with respect to their chemical characteristics as well as demonstrated entry into the CNS (or, more often, the CSF) and, where available, on their CNS anti-HIV activity. 65 One report found that at the beginning of the combination ART era, a high CPE score was associated with longer survival after a PML diagnosis, whereas in the late, more recent ART period, the effect of the CPE score disappeared as more potent ARV regimens led to more effective plasma viral load control. 66 Hence, in the current era, the effectiveness of selecting a treatment regimen with a high CPE score is not established. It seems likely that systemic rather than CNS efficacy is the salient aspect of ART in this setting because ART's most important effect on PML may be restoration of effective anti-JCV immunity that can limit CNS infection. 67,68 The history of more specifically targeted treatments for PML includes many anecdotal reports of success Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV X-4that have not been confirmed by controlled studies. Based on case reports and demonstration of in vitro inhibitory activity against JCV , intravenous (IV) and intrathecal cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) were tested in a clinical trial, but neither demonstrated clinical benefit. 69 Therefore, treatment with cytarabine is not recommended (AII). Similarly, cidofovir initially was reported to have a salutary clinical effect, but several large studies\u2014including retrospective case-control studies, an open-label clinical trial, and a meta-analysis that included patients from five large studies\u2014demonstrated no benefit. 43,58-60,70 Thus, treatment with cidofovir is also not recommended (AII). A lipid-ester derivative, hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir, recently has been reported to suppress JCV replication in cell culture,71 but its efficacy in HIV-associated PML is unknown. On the basis of a report indicating that the serotonergic 5HT2a receptor can serve as a cellular receptor for JCV in a glial cell culture system, 72,73 drugs that block the 5HT2a receptor, including olanzapine, zisprasidone, mirtazapine, cyproheptadine, and risperidone, have been suggested as treatment for PML, 74 although the rationale for this practice has been questioned.75 Again, anecdotes about favorable outcomes1,76-79 have not been substantiated by reports of genuine benefit in larger case series, cohort studies, or formal clinical trials. Thus, at this time, treatment with this class of drugs is not recommended (BIII). After a cell-culture study indicated that JCV replication could be inhibited by a topoisomerase inhibitor,80 an analogue, topotecan, was studied in a small trial. Results suggested a salutary effect in some patients, although the outcome likely was little different from the natural course in other patients with AIDS, and the main toxicities were hematologic. 81 At this time, topotecan also is not recommended (BIII). A Phase I/II clinical trial of the antimalarial drug mefloquine was initiated based on its demonstrated in vitro anti-JCV activity. The trial was later halted by the sponsor, because demonstration of efficacy was futile.82 Mefloquine cannot be recommended. Immunomodulatory approaches to the treatment of PML in HIV-infected patients have also been tried, but none has yet been studied in a prospective, controlled clinical trial. Although an initial retrospective analysis suggested that interferon-alpha might improve survival, 83 a subsequent retrospective analysis did not demonstrate benefit beyond that afforded by ART; therefore, interferon-alpha is not recommended (BIII).84 A single report described failure of interferon-beta treatment of HIV-associated PML85 and natalizumab-related PML developed in patients given interferon-beta for multiple sclerosis.15 Case reports have described improvement or recovery in PML-related neurological dysfunction in three patients who were not HIV infected and were treated with IL-2: one with Hodgkin lymphoma treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation, one with low-grade lymphoma and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and one with myelodysplastic syndrome. 86-88 Like the other reports, these too have not been followed up with more substantial trials. Recent interest in recombinant IL-7 for treatment of PML when CD4 lymphopenia is persistent, sometimes in combination with VP-1 vaccination strategy, are under consideration as an alternative adjuvant immune therapy to improve PML outcomes. 89-93 Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART ART should be started in patients not on HIV treatment as soon as PML is recognized (AII). For patients already on treatment who have demonstrated plasma HIV viremia and are adherent to therapy, ART should be adjusted based on plasma virus susceptibility (AII). Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Treatment response should be monitored with clinical examination and MRI. In patients with detectable JCV DNA in their CSF before initiation of ARV treatment, quantitation of CSF JCV DNA may prove useful as an index to follow for assessing treatment response. No clear guidelines exist for the timing of follow-up assessments, but it is reasonable to be guided by clinical progress. Often clinical deterioration is seen before stabilization and improvement occurs. 94 In patients who appear stable or improved, neuroimaging can be obtained 6 to 8 weeks after ART initiation to screen for radiographic signs of progression or of immune response, and can serve as a further baseline for subsequent scans should the patient begin to deteriorate. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV X-5In patients who clinically worsen before or after this 6- to 8-week period, repeat neuroimaging should be obtained as soon as worsening is recognized (BIII). PML-Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome PML has been reported to occur within the first weeks to months after initiating ART2,32,33,95-97 with clinical and radiographic features that differ from classical PML, including lesions with contrast enhancement, edema and mass effect, and a more rapid clinical course. 98,99 As with other presentations of IRIS, it is more likely after advanced HIV with low CD4 counts, and with greater decline in HIV viral load on initiation of ARV . This presentation has been referred to as inflammatory PML or PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS). Both unmasking of cryptic PML and paradoxical worsening in a patient with an established PML diagnosis have been observed. Histopathology typically demonstrates perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltration. 100-103 Unmasked PML-IRIS is presumed to represent the effects of a restored immune response to JCV infection in the context of ART, with resultant local immune and inflammatory responses, but other undefined factors also may contribute to unmasked PML-IRIS. Because ART-induced immune reconstitution may be associated with both onset and paradoxical worsening of PML, corticosteroids have been used empirically in this setting, with reported benefit. 2,96,104 Further study of corticosteroids for treatment of PML-IRIS is needed to confirm efficacy and refine dosage and duration. At present, however, use of corticosteroids to treat of PML-IRIS appears justified characterized by contrast enhancement, edema or mass effect, and clinical deterioration (BIII). The decision to use steroids can be difficult because it is the immune response to JCV that controls the infection and treatments that blunt that response can be deleterious. Nevertheless, the inflammatory response against PML can, at times, be more damaging than the virus itself, and corticosteroids appear to have a role in treatment of these patients. The dosage and duration of corticosteroids for PML-IRIS have not been established. In the absence of comparative data, adjuvant corticosteroid therapy should be tailored to individual patients. One approach, modeled on treatment of multiple sclerosis flairs, is to begin with a 3- to 5 day course of IV methylprednisolone dosed at 1 g per day, followed by an oral prednisone taper, dosed according to clinical response. A taper may begin with a dose of 60 mg per day in a single dose, tapered over 1 to 6 weeks. Clinical status should be monitored carefully during this taper in an attempt to minimize systemic and immune effects while avoiding IRIS recrudescence. Contrast-enhanced MRI at 2 to 6 weeks may be helpful in documenting resolution of inflammation and edema and to obtain a new baseline, recognizing that the MRI appearance may worsen despite clinical improvement and that clinical status is likely the best indicator of treatment efficacy. Importantly, ART should be continued at the standard therapeutic doses during this period (AIII). Several case reports suggest that maraviroc might be beneficial for PML-IRIS, 105 presumably related to the immunomodulatory rather than ARV properties of the CCR5 inhibitor. However, no comparative studies in HIV-associated PML have confirmed benefit of inclusion of maraviroc in HIV therapy in this setting.105-108 Although some clinicians may want to use adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to treat all cases of PML regardless of whether there is evidence of IRIS, this action is not justified and should be discouraged in patients who have no evidence of substantial inflammation on contrast-enhanced neuroimaging or on pathological examination (CIII) . In patients whose condition worsens, imaging can be repeated to monitor for development of IRIS before initiating corticosteroids. Managing Treatment Failure PML remission can take several weeks and there are no strict criteria to define treatment failure. However, a working definition may be continued clinical worsening and continued detection of CSF JCV without substantial decrease within 3 months of initiating of ART. Changes in plasma HIV RNA levels and blood CD4 cell count responses provide ancillary predictive information. Failing ART regimens should be changed based on standard guidelines for the use of ART. When PML continues to worsen despite fully suppressive anti-HIV treatment, one of the unproven therapies described above can be considered, although the possibility of toxicity must be balanced against the unproven benefits of these treatments. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV X-6Preventing Recurrence Patients who experience remission of PML after ART rarely suffer subsequent recrudescence.58,109 The main preventive measure, based on its role in reversing the disease, is treatment with an effective ART regimen that suppresses viremia and maintains CD4 cell counts (AII). Special Considerations During Pregnancy Diagnostic evaluation of PML should be the same in pregnant women as in women who are not pregnant. Therapy during pregnancy should consist of initiating or optimizing the ARV regimen. If corticosteroid therapy is initiated during pregnancy, blood sugar monitoring should be included as insulin resistance is increased during pregnancy.

The main approach to treatment is to preser ve immune function and reverse HIV-associated immunosuppression with effective ART. HIV-associated PML is often complicated by clinically significant IRIS that may require administration of corticosteroid therapy. In ART-naive patients who are diagnosed with PML, ART should be started immediately (AII). In patients who are receiving AR T but remain viremic because of inadequate adherence or drug resistance, ART should be optimized to achieve HIV suppression (AIII).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-1Syphilis (Last updated December 17, 2015; last reviewed June 26, 2019) NOTE: Update in Progress Epidemiology Syphilis is associated with an increased risk of sexual acquisition and transmission of HIV .1-5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence of the disease among men across the United States and in Western Europe ( http:// www.cdc.gov/std/stats).6-13 Although coexistent HIV infection (particularly in the advanced stages) may modify the diagnosis, natural history, or management of Treponema pallidum infection, the principles of syphilis management remain the same for persons with and without coexistent HIV infection.14-19 Clinical Manifestations The effect of coexistent HIV on the protean manifestations of syphilis have been documented in multiple case reports and small case series, and in a limited number of large studies. In most persons with HIV and syphilis, the clinical manifestations of syphilis are similar to persons without HIV infection. There are some studies that suggest HIV infection may affect the clinical presentation of syphilis, as atypical genital lesions are more apparent, and accelerated progression of syphilis may be seen in persons with advanced immunosupression. 15,16,20,21 Primary or secondary syphilis also may cause a transient decrease in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count and increase in HIV viral load that improves with recommended syphilis treatment regimens. 19,22-25 Primary syphilis commonly presents as a single painless nodule at the site of contact that rapidly ulcerates to form a classic chancre; however, multiple or atypical chancres occur and primary lesions may be absent or missed in persons with HIV infection. 15,26 Progression to secondary syphilis typically follows 2 to 8 weeks after primary inoculation. The most common manifestations of secondary syphilis are mucocutaneous lesions that are macular, maculopapular, papulosquamous, or pustular, can involve the palms and soles, and are often accompanied by generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, anorexia, arthralgias, and headache. 16,17,19 Condyloma lata (moist, flat, papular lesions in warm intertrigenous regions) can occur and may resemble condyloma accuminata caused by human papillomavirus. Lues maligna is a rare manifestation of secondary syphilis, characterized by papulopustular skin lesions that can evolve into ulcerative lesions with sharp borders and a dark central crust. 27,28 Manifestations of secondary syphilis involving other organs can occur (e.g., hepatitis, nephrotic syndrome, gastritis, pneumonia), however there is no evidence of increased frequency in persons with HIV infection. Constitutional symptoms, along with nonfocal central nervous system (CNS) symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities such as lymphocytic pleocytosis with a mildly elevated CSF protein, can be seen in secondary syphilis and acute primary HIV infection. 20,21,26,29-32 Signs and symptoms of secondary syphilis can persist from a few days to several weeks before resolving and evolving to latent stages. Latent syphilis is defined as serologic reactivity without clinical signs and symptoms of infection. Tertiary syphilis includes cardiovascular syphilis and gummatous syphilis, a slowly progressive disease that can affect any organ system. Neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis with different clinical presentations, including cranial nerve dysfunction, auditory or ophthalmic abnormalities, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic change in mental status, and loss of vibration sense. Manifestations of neurosyphilis in persons with HIV infection are similar to those in individuals who do not have HIV infection. However, clinical manifestations of neurosyphilis, such as concomitant uveitis or meningitis, may be more common in persons with HIV infection. 20,21,32-34 A recent clinical advisory has documented increased reports of ocular syphilis, a clinical manifestation of neurosyphilis that often occurs in during early syphilis. 35 Diagnosis Darkfield microscopy and tests to detect T. pallidum in lesion exudates (e.g., DFA-TP) or tissue (e.g., biopsy with silver stain) are definitive for diagnosing early syphilis. Although T. pallidum direct antigen Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-2detection tests are no longer commercially available, some laboratories provide locally developed and validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the direct detection of T. pallidum. A presumptive serologic diagnosis of syphilis is possible based upon non-treponemal tests (i.e., Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] and rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) and treponemal tests syphilis traditionally has involved screening for non-treponemal antibodies with confirmation of reactive tests by treponemal-based assays. 19,36 Some laboratories have initiated a testing algorithm using EIA or CIA as a screening test, followed by a reflex-quantitative, non-treponemal test if the EIA or CIA is positive. This latter strategy may identify those with previously treated syphilis infection, persons with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis, or those with a false positive result in persons with a low likelihood of infection. 37 In persons with a positive treponemal screening test and a negative reflex-quantitative, non-treponemal test, the laboratory should perform a second treponemal test (based on different antigens from the initial test) to confirm the results of the positive initial treponemal test. If a second treponemal test is positive, persons with a history of previous treatment appropriate for the stage of syphilis will require no further treatment unless sexual risk history suggests likelihood of re-exposure. In this instance, a repeat non-treponemal test 2 to 4 weeks after the most recent possible exposure is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment. Unless history or results of a physical examination suggest a recent infection (e.g., early stage syphilis), previously untreated persons should be treated for late latent syphilis. If the second treponemal test is negative and the risk of syphilis is low, no treatment is indicated. 19,38 Two studies demonstrated that high quantitative index values from treponemal EIA/CIA tests correlated with TP-PA positivity; however, the range of optical density values varies among different treponemal immunoassays, and the clinical significance of these findings warrant further investigation. 39,40 If the risk of syphilis is high (e.g., high risk population or community with high prevalence), a repeat nontreponemal test in 2 to 4 weeks is recommended to evaluate for early infection. In the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms, risk of neurosyphilis is low in persons with a reactive treponemal test and a non-reactive, non-treponemal test; 39,41 examination of CSF is not recommended. Early-stage disease (i.e., primary, secondary, and early-latent syphilis) in persons with HIV infection is identified using the same diagnostic tests used in persons without HIV infection: darkfield microscopy of mucocutaneous lesions and standard serologic tests. Results with VDRL and RPR may be higher, lower (in rare instances), or delayed in persons with HIV infection with early-stage syphilis. 42-46 No data indicate that treponemal tests perform differently among persons with HIV infection,47 although uncommon, false- negative serologic tests for syphilis can occur with documented T. pallidum infection.45,46 Therefore, if serologic tests do not support the diagnosis of syphilis, presumptive treatment is recommended if syphilis is suspected and use of other tests should be considered (e.g., biopsy, darkfield examination, PCR of lesion material, exclusion of prozone phenomenon, repeat serology in 2-4 weeks). By definition, persons with latent syphilis have serological evidence of syphilis (nontreponemal and treponemal testing) in the absence of clinical manifestations. Early latent syphilis is defined by evidence of infection during the preceding year by 1. A documented seroconversion or four-fold or greater increase in nontreponemal titer; or 2 Symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis; or 3. A sex partner with documented primary, secondary or early latent syphilis.19 Late latent syphilis is defined as syphilis in a person who does not have evidence of acquiring infection in the preceding year. All persons with syphilis and signs or symptoms suggesting neurologic disease (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction, auditory or ophthalmic abnormalities, meningitis, stroke, altered mental status,) warrant Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-3evaluation for neurosyphilis. An immediate ophthalmologic evaluation is recommended for persons with syphilis and ocular complaints, however a normal CSF evaluation can occur with ocular syphilis. Ocular syphilis should be managed according to the treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis, regardless of CSF results. CSF abnormalities (i.e., elevated protein and mononuclear pleocytosis) are common in early stage syphilis 48 and in persons with HIV infection, even those with no neurologic symptoms. The clinical and prognostic significance of CSF laboratory abnormalities with early stage syphilis in persons without neurologic symptoms is unknown. Several studies have demonstrated that in persons with syphilis and HIV infection, CSF laboratory abnormalities are associated with CD4 counts 350 cells/mm 3 or in combination with RPR titers 1:32.31,32,49,50 However, unless neurologic signs and symptoms are present, a CSF examination has not been associated with improved clinical outcomes. Laboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of neurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis. The diagnosis of neurosyphilis depends on a combination of CSF tests (CSF cell count or protein, and a CSF-VDRL) in the setting of reactive serologic test results and neurologic signs and symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities are common in persons with early stage syphilis and are of unknown significance in the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms. CSF examination may indicate mononuclear pleocytosis (6-200 cells/mm 3), mildly elevated protein concentration, or a reactive CSF- VDRL. Among persons with HIV infection, the CSF leukocyte count can be elevated (>5 white blood cell count [WBC]/mm 3); using a higher cutoff (>20 WBC/ mm3) might improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis.31 In persons with neurologic signs or symptoms, a reactive CSF-VDRL (in a specimen not contaminated with blood), is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis. If the CSF-VDRL is negative, but serologic tests are reactive, CSF cell count or protein are abnormal, and clinical signs of neurologic involvement are present, treatment for neurosyphilis is recommended. If the neurologic signs and symptoms are nonspecific, additional evaluation using FTA-ABS testing on CSF can be considered. The CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive; in the absence of specific neurological signs and symptoms, neurosyphilis is unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS test. 51,52 RPR tests on the CSF have been associated with a high false negative rate and are not recommended.53 PCR-based diagnostic methods are not currently recommended as diagnostic tests for neurosyphilis. Preventing Exposure and Disease The resurgence of syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV infection in the United States underscores the importance of primary prevention of syphilis in this population, which should begin with a behavioral risk assessment and routine discussion of sexual behaviors. Health care providers should discuss client-centered risk reduction messages and provide specific actions that can reduce the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases and of transmitting HIV infection. 19,54-58 Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all persons with HIV infection who are sexually active, with more frequent screening (i.e., every 3-6 months) for those who have multiple or anonymous partners. 19,59-61 The occurrence of syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infection in a person with HIV infection is an indication of risk behaviors that should prompt intensified risk assessment and counseling messages about the manifestations of syphilis, risk of HIV transmission, and prevention strategies with strong consideration of referral for behavioral intervention. 62 Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea at anatomic sites of exposure in men and for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in women. 19,63 Preventing Disease Frequent serologic screening can identify persons recently infected and in some instances, before infectious lesions develop. Treatment can prevent disease progression in the individual and transmission to a partner. Studies in the pre-HIV era demonstrated that approximately one-third of the sex partners of persons who have primary syphilis will develop syphilis within 30 days of exposure, and empiric treatment of incubating Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-4syphilis will prevent the development of disease in those who are exposed and onward syphilis transmission to their partners.64-67 Those who have had recent sexual contact with a person with syphilis in any stage should be evaluated clinically and serologically and treated presumptively with regimens outlined in current recommendations. Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who receives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis within 90 days preceding the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis, even if serologic test results are negative (AIII) . Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who receives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis more than 90 days before the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis if serologic test results are not immediately available and the opportunity for follow-up is uncertain. If serologic tests are negative, no treatment is needed. If serologic tests are positive, treatment should be based on clinical and serologic evaluation and stage of syphilis. Long-term sex partners of persons who have late latent syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically for syphilis and treated on the basis of the evaluation's findings. Sexual partners of infected persons considered at risk of infection should be notified of their exposure and the importance of evaluation. 19 The following sex partners of persons with syphilis are considered at risk for infection and should be confidentially notified of the exposure and need for evaluation: Partners who have had sexual contact within 3 months plus the duration of symptoms for persons who receive a diagnosis of primary syphilis, Partners who have had sexual contact within 6 months plus duration of symptoms for those with secondary syphilis, and Partners who have had sexual contact within 1 year for persons with early latent syphilis. Treating Disease Treatment regimens for syphilis demonstrate that most persons with HIV infection respond appropriately to single dose benzathine penicillin for primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis.18,19,43 Closer follow-up is recommended, however, because serologic nonresponse and neurologic complications may be higher in persons with HIV infection. 21,68,69 Penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for syphilis. Persons with HIV infection with early-stage (e.g., primary, secondary, or early-latent) syphilis should receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of 2.4 million Units (U) of benzathine penicillin G (AII). 19 The available data demonstrate that high-dose amoxicillin given with probenecid in addition to benzathine penicillin G in early syphilis is not associated with improved clinical outcomes. 43 Persons with a penicillin allergy whose compliance or follow-up cannot be ensured should be desensitized and treated with benzathine penicillin (AIII) . The efficacy of alternative non-penicillin regimens in persons with HIV infection and early syphilis has not been well studied. The use of any alternative penicillin treatment regimen should be undertaken only with close clinical and serologic monitoring. Several retrospective studies support use of doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, to treat early syphilis (BII). 70,71 Limited clinical studies, mainly in persons without HIV infection suggest that ceftriaxone, 1 g daily either IM or intravenously (IV) for 10 to 14 days, is effective for treating early stage syphilis (BII), but the optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been defined. 72 A single 2-g oral dose of azithromycin has been shown to be effective for treating early syphilis.73-75 However T. pallidum chromosomal mutations associated with azithromycin resistance and treatment failures have been reported most commonly in MSM.76-81 Azithromycin treatment has not been well studied in persons with HIV infection with early stage syphilis and it should be used with caution in instances when treatment with penicillin or doxycycline is not feasible (BII). Azithromycin has not been studied in pregnant women. Therefore, azithromycin should not be used in MSM or in pregnant women (AII). In persons with HIV infection who have late latent syphilis, treatment with 3 weekly IM injections of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G is recommended (AII). Alternative therapy is doxycycline, 100 mg Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-5orally twice daily for 28 days, however, it has not been sufficiently evaluated in persons with HIV infection (BIII). Limited clinical studies and biologic and pharmacologic evidence suggest that ceftriaxone may be effective; however, the optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been determined. 82,83 If the clinical situation requires use of an alternative to penicillin, treatment should be undertaken with close clinical and serologic monitoring. Persons with HIV infection who have clinical evidence of tertiary syphilis (i.e., cardiovascular or gummatous disease) should have CSF examination to rule out CSF abnormalities before therapy is initiated. If the CSF evaluation is normal, the recommended treatment of late-stage syphilis is 3 weekly IM injections of 2.4 million U benzathine penicillin G (AII). 19 However, the complexity of tertiary syphilis management, especially cardiovascular syphilis, is beyond the scope of these guidelines and health care providers are advised to consult an infectious disease specialist. Persons with HIV infection diagnosed with neurosyphilis or ocular or otic syphilis should receive IV aqueous crystalline penicillin G, 18 to 24 million U daily, administered 3 to 4 million U IV every 4 hours or by continuous infusion for 10 to 14 days (AII) or procaine penicillin, 2.4 million U IM once daily plus probenecid 500 mg orally 4 times a day for 10 to 14 days (BII). 19,31,32 Persons with HIV infection who are allergic to sulfa-containing medications should not be given probenecid because of potential allergic reaction (AIII) . Although systemic steroids are used frequently as adjunctive therapy for otologic syphilis, such therapy has not been proven beneficial. Because neurosyphilis treatment regimens are of shorter duration than those used in late-latent syphilis, 2.4 million U benzathine penicillin IM once per week for up to 3 weeks after completion of neurosyphilis treatment can be considered to provide a comparable duration of therapy (CIII) . 19 Desensitization to penicillin is the preferred approach to treating neurosyphilis in patients who are allergic to penicillin. However, limited data indicate that ceftriaxone (2 g daily IV for 10-14 days) may be an acceptable alternative regimen (BII). 83 Other alternative regimens for neurosyphilis have not been evaluated adequately. Syphilis treatment recommendations are also available in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. 19 Special Considerations with Regard to Starting Antiretroviral Therapy There are no special considerations regarding the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with syphilis. Specifically, there is currently no evidence that treatment with ART needs to be delayed until treatment for syphilis has been completed. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in association with syphilis and treatment with ART in persons with HIV infection is uncommon. 84 Monitoring and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Clinical and serologic responses (four-fold decrease from the nontreponemal titer at the time of treatment) to treatment of early-stage (primary, secondary, and early-latent) disease should be performed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after therapy to ensure resolution of signs and symptoms within 3 to 6 months and seroversion or a fold four decline in nontreponemal titers within 12 to 24 months. Clinical and serologic responses to treatment are similar in persons with HIV infection; subtle variations can occur, however, including a slower temporal pattern of serologic response in persons with HIV infection. 18,19,43,85 Factors associated with the serologic response to treatment in persons without HIV infection include younger age, earlier syphilis stage, and higher RPR titer.86,87 If clinical signs and symptoms persist, treatment failure should be considered. If clinical signs or symptoms recur or there is a sustained four-fold increase in non-treponemal titers of greater than 2 weeks, treatment failure or re-infection should be considered and managed per recommendations (see Managing Treatment Failure). The potential for re-infection should be based on the sexual history and risk assessment. Clinical trial data have demonstrated that 15% to 20% of persons (including persons with HIV infection) treated with recommended therapy for early stage syphilis will not achieve the four-fold decline in nontreponemal titer used to define treatment response at one year. 19,43 Serum non-treponemal test titers may remain reactive at a stable level (serofast), usually 1:8, although rarely may be higher, for prolonged periods. In addition, persons treated for early stage syphilis who have a four-fold decline in titer may not sero-revert to a negative nontreponemal test Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-6and may remain serofast. These serofast states probably do not represent treatment failure. Response to therapy for late latent syphilis should be monitored using non-treponemal serologic tests at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months to ensure at least a four-fold decline in titer, if initially high (1:32), within 12 to 24 months of therapy. However, data to define the precise time intervals for adequate serologic responses are limited. Most persons with low titers and late latent syphilis remain serofast after treatment often without a four-fold decline in the initial titer. If clinical symptoms develop or a four-fold increase in non-treponemal titers is sustained, then treatment failure or re-infection should be considered and managed per recommendations (see Managing Treatment Failure). The potential for reinfection should be based on the sexual history and risk assessment. 19 The earliest CSF indicator of response to neurosyphilis treatment is a decline in CSF lymphocytosis. The CSF-VDRL may respond more slowly. If CSF pleocytosis was present initially, a CSF examination should be repeated at 6 months. Limited data suggest that changes in CSF parameters may occur more slowly in persons with HIV infection, especially with advanced immunosuppression. 20,31 If the cell count has not decreased after 6 months or if the CSF WBC is not normal after 2 years, re-treatment should be considered. In persons on ART with neurosyphilis, declines in serum RPR titers after treatment correlate with normalization of CSF parameters. 88 Use of ART in persons with syphilis has also been associated with a reduced risk of serologic failure of syphilis treatment,20 and a lower risk of developing neurosyphilis.20 The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction frequently accompanied by headache and myalgia that can occur within the first 24 hours after initiation of treatment for syphilis. Antipyretics can be used to manage symptoms but have not been proven to prevent this reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs most frequently in persons with early syphilis, high non-treponemal antibody titers, and prior penicillin treatment. 89 Persons with syphilis should be warned about this reaction, instructed how to manage it, and informed it is not an allergic reaction to penicillin. Managing Possible Treatment Failure or Re-infection Re-treatment should be considered for persons with early-stage syphilis who have persistent or recurring clinical signs or symptoms of disease, or a sustained four-fold increase in serum non-treponemal titers after an initial four-fold decrease following treatment. The assessment for potential reinfection should be informed by a sexual history and syphilis risk assessment including information about a recent sexual partner with signs or symptoms or recent treatment for syphilis. One study showed that 6% of MSM had a repeat early stage syphilis infection within 2 years of initial infection; HIV infection, Black race, and having multiple sexual partners were associated with increased risk of reinfection. 10 Serologic response should be compared to the titer at the time of treatment. However, assessing serologic response to treatment can be difficult, as definitive criteria for cure or failure have not been well established. Person with HIV infection may be at increased risk of treatment failure, but the magnitude of these risks is not precisely defined and is likely low. 19,30,69 Persons who meet the criteria for treatment failure (i.e., signs or symptoms that persist or recur or a four-fold increase or greater in titer sustained for more than 2 weeks) and who are at low risk for reinfection should be managed for possible treatment failure. Persons whose non-treponemal titers do not decrease four-fold with 12 to 24 months of therapy can also be managed as a possible treatment failure. Management includes a CSF examination and retreatment with benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million U at 1-week intervals for 3 weeks (BIII), unless the CSF examination is consistent with CNS involvement. If titers do not respond appropriately after re-treatment, the value of repeated CSF examination or additional therapy is unclear, but it is generally not recommended. Treatment with benzathine penicillin, 2.4 million U IM without a CSF examination unless signs or symptoms of syphilis, and close clinical follow-up can be considered in persons with recurrent signs and symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis or a four-fold increase in non-treponemal titers within the past year who are at high risk of syphilis re-infection (CIII) . Persons treated for late latent syphilis should have a CSF examination and be re-treated if they develop clinical signs or symptoms of syphilis or have a sustained four-fold increase in serum non-treponemal test Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-7titer and are low risk for infection; this can also be considered if they experience an inadequate serologic response (i.e., less than four-fold decline in an initially high [1:32] non-treponemal test titer) within 12 to 24 months of therapy. If CSF examination is consistent with CNS involvement, re-treatment should follow the recommendations for treatment of neurosyphilis. Persons with a normal CSF examination should be treated with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million U IM weekly for 3 doses (BIII). As with early stage syphilis, the value of repeated CSF examination or additional therapy is unclear, but is generally not recommended. Treatment with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million U IM without a CSF examination unless signs or symptoms of neurosyphilis, and close clinical follow-up can be considered in persons with signs or symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis or a four-fold increase in non-treponemal titers within the past year who are at high risk of re-infection (CIII) . Re-treatment for neurosyphilis should be considered if the CSF cell count has not decreased 6 months after completion of treatment or if the CSF cell count or protein is not normal after 2 years. 19 Preventing Recurrence No recommendations indicate the need for secondary prophylaxis or prolonged chronic maintenance antimicrobial therapy for syphilis. Targeted mass treatment of high-risk populations with azithromycin has not been demonstrated to be effective. 90 Azithromycin is not recommended as secondary prevention because of azithromycin treatment failures reported in persons with HIV infection and reports of chromosomal mutations associated with macrolide-resistant T. pallidum. 76-78,80,81 A small pilot study has demonstrated that daily doxycycline prophylaxis was associated with a decreased incidence of syphilis among MSM with HIV infection.91 Special Considerations During Pregnancy Pregnant women should be screened for syphilis at the first prenatal visit. In communities and populations in which the prevalence of syphilis is high and in women at high risk of infection, serologic testing should also be performed twice in the third trimester (ideally at 28-32 weeks gestation) and at delivery. 19 Syphilis screening also should be offered at sites providing episodic care to pregnant women at high risk, including emergency departments, jails, and prisons. 92 Antepartum screening with non-treponemal testing is typical but treponemal screening is being used in some settings. Pregnant women with reactive treponemal screening tests should have additional quantitative testing with non-treponemal tests because titers are essential for monitoring treatment response. If a treponemal EIA or CIA test is used for antepartum syphilis screening, all positive EIA/CIA tests should be confirmed with a quantitative, non-treponemal test (RPR or VDRL). If the non-treponemal test is negative and the prozone reaction is ruled out, then the results are discordant; a second treponemal test should be performed, preferably on the same specimen (see Diagnosis section above). 93 No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without documentation of maternal syphilis serologic status determined at least once during pregnancy. 94 All women who have a fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation also should be tested for syphilis. Rates of transmission to the fetus and adverse pregnancy outcomes for untreated syphilis are highest with primary, secondary, and early-latent syphilis and decrease with increasing duration of infection. Pregnancy does not appear to alter the clinical course, manifestations, or diagnostic test results for syphilis infection in adults. Concurrent syphilis infection has been associated with increased risk of perinatal transmission of HIV to the infant. 95-100 Pregnant women with reactive syphilis serology should be considered infected unless an adequate treatment history is documented clearly in the medical records and sequential serologic antibody titers have declined appropriately for the stage of syphilis. In general, the risk of antepartum fetal infection or congenital syphilis at delivery is related to the quantitative maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if it 1:8. Serofast low antibody titers after documented treatment for the stage of infection might not require additional treatment; however, rising or persistently high antibody titers may indicate reinfection or treatment failure, and treatment should be considered. 19 Penicillin is recommended for the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy. Penicillin is the only known Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-8effective antimicrobial for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus and for treatment of fetal infection; however evidence is insufficient to determine the optimal penicillin regimen.101 There is some evidence to suggest that additional therapy (a second dose of benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million U IM administered 1 week after the initial dose) may be considered for pregnant women with early syphilis (primary, secondary, and early-latent syphilis) (BII). 19,102,103 Because of concerns about the efficacy of standard therapy in pregnant women who have HIV infection, a second injection in 1 week should also be considered for pregnant women with HIV infection (BIII). Since no alternatives to penicillin have been proven effective and safe for prevention of fetal infection, pregnant women who have a history of penicillin allergy should undergo desensitization and treatment with penicillin (AIII) . 19 Erythromycin and azithromycin do not reliably cure maternal or fetal infection (AII); tetracyclines should not be used during pregnancy because of concerns about hepatotoxicity and staining of fetal bones and teeth (AII). 98,104 Data are insufficient on use of ceftriaxone105 for treatment of maternal infection and prevention of congenital syphilis (BIII). Treatment of syphilis during the second half of pregnancy may precipitate preterm labor or fetal distress if it is associated with a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. 106 Pregnant women should be advised to seek obstetric attention after treatment if they notice contractions or a decrease in fetal movement. During the second half of pregnancy, syphilis management can be facilitated with sonographic fetal evaluation for congenital syphilis, but this evaluation should not delay therapy. Sonographic signs of fetal or placental syphilis indicate a greater risk of fetal treatment failure. 107 Such cases should be managed in consultation with high-risk obstetric specialists. After 20 weeks of gestation, fetal and contraction monitoring for 24 hours after initiation of treatment for early syphilis should be considered when sonographic findings indicate fetal infection. At a minimum, repeat serologic titers should be performed in the third trimester and at delivery for women treated for syphilis during pregnancy, appropriate for the stage of infection. Data are insufficient on the non-treponemal serologic response to syphilis after stage-appropriate therapy in pregnant women with HIV infection. Non-treponemal titers can be assessed monthly in women at high risk of re-infection. Clinical and non-treponemal antibody titer responses should be appropriate for the stage of disease, although most women will deliver before their serologic response can be definitively assessed. Maternal treatment is likely to be inadequate if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy, if a woman has clinical signs of infection at delivery, or if the maternal antibody titer is four-fold higher than the pre-treatment titer. 19 The medical provider caring for the newborn should be informed of the mother's serologic and treatment status so that proper evaluation and treatment of the infant can be provided. Recommendations for Treating Treponema pallidum Infections (Syphilis) to Prevent Disease (page 1 of 2) Empiric treatment of incubating syphilis is recommended to prevent the development of disease in those who are sexually exposed. Indication for Treatment: Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who receives a diagnosis of primar y, secondary, or early latent syphilis within 90 days preceding the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis, even if serologic test results are negative (AIII). Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who receives a diagnosis of primar y, secondary, or early latent syphilis >90 days before the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis if serologic test results are not immediately available and the opportunity for follow-up is uncertain (AIII). Treatment: Same as for early stage syphilis listed below General Considerations for Treating Syphilis: The efficacy of non-penicillin alternatives has not been well evaluated in persons with HIV infection and should be undertake n only with close clinical and serologic monitoring. The Jarisch-Her xheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction accompanied by headache and myalgias that can occur within the first 24 hours after therapy. It occurs more frequently in persons with early syphilis, high non-treponemal antibody titers, and prior penicillin treatment. Patients should be warned about this reaction and informed it is not an allergic reaction to penicillin. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-9Key to Acronyms: BID = twice a day; CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; IM = intramuscular; IV = intraveneously; MSM = men who have sex with men; PO = orally; QID = four times a day; q(n)h = U = UnitsRecommendations for Treating Treponema pallidum Infections (Syphilis) to Prevent Disease (page 2 of 2) Treatment Recommendations Depending on Stage of Disease Early Stage (Primary, Secondary, and Early-Latent Syphilis) Preferred Therapy: Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM for 1 dose (AII) Alternative Therapy (For Penicillin-Allergic Patients): Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 14 days (BII), or Ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV daily for 10-14 days (BII), or Azithromycin 2 g PO for 1 dose (BII) Note: Chromosomal mutations associated with azithromycin resistance and treatment failures have been reported, most commonly in MSM. Azithromycin should be used with caution and only when treatment with penicillin, doxycycline or ceftriaxone is not feasible. Azithromycin is not recommended for MSM or pregnant women (AII) Note: Persons with penicillin allergy whose compliance or follow-up cannot be ensured and all pregnant women with penicillin allergy should be desensitized and treated with benzathine penicillin. For pregnant women with early syphilis, a second dose of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM after one week the single dose treatment may be considered (BII). Late-Latent (>1 year) or Latent of Unknown Duration Preferred Therapy: Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM weekly for 3 doses (AII) Alternative Therapy (For Penicillin-Allergic Patients): Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 28 days (BIII) Note: Persons with penicillin allergy whose compliance or follow-up cannot be ensured should be desensitized and treated with benzathine penicillin Late-Stage (Tertiary\u2014Cardiovascular or Gummatous Disease) Perform CSF examination to rule out neurosyphilis and obtain infectious diseases consultation to guide management Preferred Therapy: Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM weekly for 3 doses (AII) Neurosyphilis, Otic, or Ocular Disease Preferred Therapy: Aqueous cr ystalline penicillin G, 18-24 million U per day, administered as 3-4 million U IV q4h or by continuous IV infusion for 10-14 days (AII) +/- benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM weekly for 1 to 3 doses after completion of IV therapy (CIII) Alternative Therapy: Procaine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM daily plus probenecid 500 mg PO QID for 10-14 days (BII) +/- benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM weekly for up to 3 doses after completion of above (CIII) Persons who are allergic to sulfa-containing medications should not be given probenecid, thus the procaine penicillin regimen is not recommended (AIII). For Penicillin-Allergic Patients: Desensitization to penicillin is the preferred approach; if not feasible, ceftriaxone 2 g IM or IV daily for 10-14 days (BII) Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Y-10References 1.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-1Talaromycosis (Last updated November 21, 2019; last reviewed November 21, 2019) Epidemiology Talaromycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei (formerly Penicillium marneffei ) which is endemic in Southeast Asia (in northern Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar), East Asia (in southern China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), and South Asia (in northeastern India) (see the geographic distribution of talaromycosis in Figure 1).1-4 Talaromyces marneffei was formerly classified under the Penicillium subgenus based on morphological characteristics. In 2011, the subgenus Biverticillium was found to form a monophyletic group with Talaromyces that is distinct from Penicillium , and was taxonomically unified with the Penicillium marneffei was changed to Talaromyces marneffei, and the disease penicilliosis is now called talaromycosis. HIV is a major risk factor for talaromycosis in highly-endemic regions, accounting for approximately 88% of disease. 2 The fungus is also a major cause of HIV-associated opportunistic infections in these regions, making up to 16% of hospital admissions due to AIDS,2,3,6-8 and is a leading cause of HIV-associated blood stream infection and death in Vietnam and southern China.6,9-11 Infection occurs predominantly in individuals who have very advanced HIV disease with a CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count of <100 cells/mm 3.2,3,12 Talaromycosis is increasingly diagnosed in immunocompromised individuals who are returning travelers or immigrants from the endemic regions, and has been reported in Japan, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Oman in the Middle East, and the United States. 13,14 Talaromycosis is increasingly recognized in individuals who have a immunodeficiency condition (e.g., idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia, gain-of-function mutation in STAT1/STAT3 pathways); secondary immunodeficiency conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases in patients on corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive therapy, solid and hematological malignancies, solid organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and therapy with novel target therapies such as monoclonal antibodies against CD20 and kinase inhibitors). 15 Talaromycosis-related mortality despite antifungal therapy in patients both with and without HIV is up to 30%.2,3,12,16,17 Similar to other endemic mycoses, talaromycosis is a saprozoonotic infection, meaning the transmissible source has a reservoir both in an abiotic environment and in an animal host. The wild bamboo rat in highland areas in the endemic regions is the known animal reservoir of T. marneffei; 18,19 however, case- control studies suggest that human infection results from inhalation of fungal spores released from a soil-related environmental reservoir (plants and farmed animals) rather than from direct bamboo rat to human transmission. 20,21 Talaromycosis incidence increased 30% to 50% during the rainy months in southern Vietnam and northern Thailand,3,22 and was associated with increased humidity and not precipitation,23,24 suggesting that humidity facilitates an expansion of the environmental reservoir resulting in increased exposure to the fungus. Reactivation of latent infections has been demonstrated in non-autochthonous cases with a history of remote travel to the endemic countries and can occur many years after exposure. 13,14,25 One case of presumed laboratory-acquired talaromycosis was reported in an African man with HIV while at the Pasteur Institute in Paris; 26 however, laboratory-acquired infection has never been reported from the endemic regions. Donor-acquired transmission has been reported in a lung-transplant recipient from Belgium.27 Clinical Manifestations Disseminated infection involving multiple organ systems is the most common manifestation of talaromycosis in patients with advanced HIV disease. The infection frequently begins as a subacute illness characterized by fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and respiratory and gastrointestinal abnormalities. 3,28 These clinical features are non-specific and are indistinguishable from those of disseminated tuberculosis, other systemic mycoses, or infections due to intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella species. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-2Skin lesions are the most specific but late manifestations of talaromycosis, with central-necrotic papules appearing on the face, trunk, and extremities occurring in 40% to 70% of patients.1,3,29 Pulmonary involvement manifested as cough or shortness of breath occurs in 40% of patients. Gastrointestinal involvement presenting as diarrhea or abdominal pain occurs in 30% of patients. Significant hepatosplenomegaly is present in 70% of patients and together with intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy cause abdominal distention and pain. 3,7 Meningoencephalitis is a rare manifestation, occurring in <1% of patients, and has a rapid disease course with a mortality of 80%.30 Concurrent infections with other opportunistic pathogens occur in up to 60% of patients, with oropharyngeal candidiasis being the most common.2 Tuberculosis coinfection is common (occurring in up to 22% of patients in highly endemic regions) and complicates disease management because of itraconazole and rifampin drug interactions. 3 Common laboratory findings associated with talaromycosis include anemia and thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration. Anemia can be profound and may require multiple red cell transfusions. Elevation of aminotransferase is common, with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) over alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio of approximately 2. 3 The median CD4 count in multiple cohorts is <50 cells/mm3.2,3 The chest radiographical findings are broad, ranging from diffuse interstitial disease to reticulonodular infiltrates to alveola infiltrates causing respiratory failure. 31 Diagnosis A diagnosis of talaromycosis should be considered in all patients with HIV with CD4 count <100 cells/mm3 who have traveled to or have lived in talaromycosis-endemic areas and present with a systemic infection involving the reticuloendothelial system (i.e., lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow). Skin lesions in talaromycosis have typical central-necrotic appearance and can be a diagnostic sign. However, skin lesions are a late manifestation of talaromycosis and are absent in up to 60% of patients. 1,3,29 The current diagnostic methods for talaromycosis are still based on conventional microscopy, histology, and culture. Culture results usually return within 4 days to 5 days but can take up to 14 days. Diagnostic delay, particularly in patients presenting without fever or skin lesions, is associated with increased mortality. 2,3,15,32 Antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are promising rapid diagnostics currently being evaluated. Microscopy, Histology, and Culture are the Current Gold Standard Diagnostic Methods A presumptive diagnosis of talaromycosis can be made based on the microscopic examination of Giemsa-, Wright-, or Gomori Methenamine Silver (GMS)-stained samples scrapings, lymph node aspirate, bone marrow aspirate, or tissue sections showing round to oval extracellular and intra-macrophage yeast-like organisms measuring 3 to 6 \u00b5m in diameter. Identification of a clear midline septum in a dividing yeast cell is what distinguishes T. marneffei from Histoplasma or Candida species. 1 In some patients, the fungus can be identified by microscopic examination of a Wright's-stained peripheral blood smear.33 A definitive diagnosis of talaromycosis can be made by the histopathologic demonstration of the organism in biopsy specimens. There are three histopathological forms. The granulomatous reaction is formed by histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma, epithelioid, and giant cells and can be seen in reticuloendothelial organs in patients who are HIV-negative or immunocompetent. The suppurative reaction develops with the joining of multiple abscesses seen in the lung and subcutaneous tissues of immunocompetent patients. The anergic and necrotizing reaction is characterized by focal necrosis surrounded by distended histiocytes containing proliferating fungi seen in the lung, liver, and spleen of immunocompromised patients. 34 Most frequently a definitive diagnosis of talaromycosis is based on isolation of the organism from cultures of clinical specimens. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-3Compared to other endemic dimorphic fungi, T. marneffei grows more readily in standard BACTEC blood culture media and Sabouraud dextrose agar, but takes 5 to 14 days to grow and to demonstrate temperature dimorphism. At 25\u00baC to 30\u00baC, the fungus grows as a mold producing yellow-green colonies with sulcate folds and a red diffusible pigment in the media. Microscopically, filamentous hyphae with characteristic spore-bearing structures called conidiophores and conidia can be seen. At 32\u00baC to 37\u00baC, the fungus makes the morphological transition from a mold to a yeast, producing tan colored colonies without a red diffusible pigment. In laboratory media, only the transitional sausage-shaped cells can be seen microscopically. The round-to-oval yeast cells are only seen in natural tissue. 1 Culture yield is the highest from bone marrow (100%), followed by skin lesions (90%) and blood (70%).3,35 Less commonly, talaromycosis has been diagnosed from sputum, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, pericardium fluid, stool, and urine. Molecular Diagnosis Molecular diagnostics for talaromycosis have been based on PCR amplification and sequence identification of specific regions within the fungal ribosome's internally transcribed spacer regions, the 5.8S rRNA, and 18S rRNA genes of T. marneffei. 36-39 These assays have high specificity (100%), but limited sensitivity (60% to 70%). At present, none of the real-time PCR assays has been prospectively validated, standardized, or commercially developed for clinical use. Antigen Detection The commercial assay for the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan cross reacts with T. marneffei and has a sensitivity of 95.8% (23 of 24 patients with culture-positive talaromycosis were correctly identified) and a specificity of 90.9% (30 of 33 people without talaromycosis were correctly identified) for the detection of talaromycosis (at cutoff index = 1.0). 40 However, the galactomannan test also cross reacts with other endemic fungi such as Histoplasma and Blastomyces and has not been evaluated prospectively. The Mp1p ELISA has been shown to be more sensitive than blood culture (in 372 culture-proven talaromycosis cases, sensitivity was 86.3% for the Mp1p ELISA and 74% for blood culture) and is highly specific (98.1% specificity in 338 healthy controls and 179 patients without HIV , but with other infections). 41 This assay was used to screen a large serum bank of 8,131 patients with HIV in Guangzhou, China and showed a Mp1p antigenemia prevalence of 9.4%, with prevalence of antigenemia increased from 4.5% to 28.4% as the CD4 count decreased from 200 cells/mm 3 to 50 cells/mm3, demonstrating a significant burden of disease in southern China.24 In Vietnam, the Mp1p ELISA identified 4.2% antigenemia in 1,123 asymptomatic patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 22 HIV clinics across Vietnam who had a CD4 count <100 cells/mm 3. Antigenemia was found to be independently associated with 12-month mortality.42 These data demonstrate that the Mp1p ELISA has the potential to detect infection earlier than culture allows and can potentially be used as a screening tool for sub-clinical infection, permitting pre-emptive antifungal therapy to prevent disease development. This is an area of active research. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Method The Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) method has recently been used for identification of Talaromyces to the species level from cultured specimens based on either an in-house database generated from institution's T. marneffei clinical strain collection 43,44 or from the comprehensive National Institutes of Health MDL Mold Library.45 The MALDI-TOF represents a rapid and reliable tool for downstream fungal identification, eliminating the need to demonstrate thermal dimorphism. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) have been consistently low for itraconazole, intermediate for amphotericin B, and high for fluconazole. Thus far, only one retrospective case series from Chiang Mai in Thailand correlated MIC data of 30 clinical isolates with patient outcomes. More recent studies reported Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-4low MIC values for the newer generation high MIC values of 2 \u00b5g/ml to 8 \u00b5g/mL for anidulafungin, 46 the later study utilized a commercial Sensititre YeastOneTM YO10 assay.47 These results suggest promising activity of voriconazole and posaconazole for the treatment of talaromycosis, and suggest that the echinocandins are less effective against T. marneffei. Preventing Exposure Two case-controls studies in Thailand and Vietnam demonstrated that patients with World Health Organization (WHO) Stage 4 HIV disease or a CD4 count <100 cells/ mm3 who had an occupational exposure to plants and farmed animals were at increased risk for infection.20,21 The risk was higher in the rainy and humid months.3,22 Residency or a history of traveling to the highland regions (as short as 3 days) was a risk factor for talaromycosis in patients with advanced HIV disease in southern Vietnam. 20 These data suggest that patients with advanced HIV should avoid visiting the areas where talaromycosis is highly endemic, particularly highland regions during the rainy and humid months (BIII) . Preventing Disease Primary prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of talaromycosis and other invasive fungal infections. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Chiang Mai, Thailand, demonstrated that oral itraconazole 200 mg daily for primary prophylaxis significantly reduced the occurrence of invasive fungal infections (predominantly cryptococcosis and talaromycosis) in patients with HIV with a CD4 count <200 cells/ mm3.48 In a retrospective study also in Chiang Mai, fluconazole (400 mg weekly) was shown to be as effective as itraconazole (200 mg daily) for primary prophylaxis. 49 However, these studies were conducted prior to the widespread use of ART, had small sample sizes, and a mortality benefit was not observed. Therefore, primary prophylaxis has not been widely adopted given concerns about long-term toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and costs. Indication for Primary Prophylaxis Primary prophylaxis is only recommended for patients with HIV with CD4 counts <100 cells/ mm3 who reside in the highly-endemic regions in northern Thailand, southern China, and northern and southern Vietnam who are unable to have ART for whatever reasons or have treatment failure without access to effective antiretroviral options (BI). The drug choices for prophylaxis are oral itraconazole 200 mg once daily (BI) or oral fluconazole 400 mg once weekly (BII) . Primary prophylaxis is not recommended in patients who are on or about to start effective ART and is not recommended in geographic areas outside of the mentioned highly endemic regions (AIII) . For patients with HIV from the United States and from countries outside of the endemic region who are not on effective ART, have a CD4 count <100 cells/ mm3, and must travel to the highly-endemic areas mentioned, primary prophylaxis with either itraconazole or fluconazole should begin 3 days prior to travel to allow serum drug level to reach steady state and may continue for 1 week after travel (BIII) . Discontinuation of Primary Prophylaxis Primary prophylaxis for talaromycosis can reasonably be discontinued in patients who are ART adherent and have a sustained CD4 count 100 cells/ mm3 for over 6 months (BII) . In areas where viral load monitoring has replaced CD4 count monitoring, primary prophylaxis can reasonably be discontinued in patients who achieve sustained virologic suppression over 6 months (BIII) . Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-5Treating Disease Disseminated talaromycosis is fatal if untreated.50 The case fatality rates with antifungal therapy range from 10% to 30%.2,3,6,16 Antifungal therapy for talaromycosis is divided into induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases. The treatment recommendations are based on several observational studies in Thailand and China51-54 and the recent Itraconazole versus Amphotericin B for Penicilliosis (IV AP) randomized, controlled trial in Vietnam. 55 In an earlier non-comparative prospective study of 74 patients in Thailand, induction therapy with deoxycholate amphotericin B for 2 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with itraconazole for 10 weeks was shown to be highly effective. Treatment success rate (defined by negative blood culture and resolution of fever and skin lesions at the end of a 12-week treatment course) was 97%. 51 V oriconazole has been used for induction therapy in patients who could not tolerate amphotericin B and was shown to have favorable clinical and microbiological outcomes in 8 of 9 patients in Thailand 53 and 10 of 14 patients in China.52 The IV AP trial randomized 440 patients across 5 hospitals in Vietnam and demonstrated that induction therapy with amphotericin B was superior to itraconazole with respect to 6-month mortality (absolute risk of death was 11% and 21%, respectively; hazard ratio of death in the itraconazole arm was 1.88 [95% confidence interval, 1.15\u20143.09, P = 0.012]). Patients in the amphotericin B arm had significantly lower rates of disease complications, including disease relapse and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and had a four-fold faster rate of blood fungal clearance. The difference in mortality between the arms was not dependent on disease severity (based on positive blood culture, blood fungal count, or requirement for oxygen support at presentation) or by a participant's immune status (CD4 count <50 cells/ mm3 or mm3), or intravenous (IV) drug use.55 The recommended induction therapy for all patients, regardless of disease severity, is amphotericin B, preferably liposomal amphotericin B 3 to 5 mg/kg body weight/day where available, or deoxycholate amphotericin B 0.7 mg/kg body weight/day, IV for 2 weeks (AI). Induction therapy should be followed by consolidation therapy with oral itraconazole, 200 mg every 12 hours for a subsequent duration of 10 weeks (AI).55 After this period, maintenance therapy (or secondary prophylaxis) with oral itraconazole 200 mg/day is recommended to prevent recurrence until the CD4 count rises above 100 cells/ mm3 for 6 months (AI).56 For patients unable to tolerate any form of amphotericin, induction therapy with IV voriconazole 6 mg/kg every 12 hours on day 1 (loading dose), then 4 mg/kg every 12 hours or with oral voriconazole 600 mg every 12 hours on day 1 (loading dose), then 400 mg every 12 hours for 2 weeks is recommended (BII) .52,53 Thereafter, either oral voriconazole or oral itraconazole 200 mg every 12 hours can be used for consolidation therapy for 10 weeks, followed by itraconazole 200 mg/day for secondary prophylaxis. The optimal dose of voriconazole for secondary prophylaxis beyond 12 weeks has not been studied. Itraconazole is not recommended as an induction therapy for talaromycosis, regardless of disease severity (AI).55 Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART No studies exist regarding the optimal time to start ART in patients with HIV who have talaromycosis. In the IV AP trial, the median time to ART initiation, which was similar in both arms, was 3 weeks (range: 1 week-5 weeks). Paradoxical IRIS events occurred only in the itraconazole arm (in 11.4% of patients), suggesting Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-6that ART can be safely initiated as early as 1 week after starting effective antifungal therapy with amphotericin B (BIII) .55 Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) Adverse Event Monitoring Patients treated with amphotericin B should be monitored for infusion-related adverse reactions (fever, rigors, nausea, vomiting), electrolyte disturbances (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia), nephrotoxicity (rise in creatinine), and anemia. Hydration with 500 mL to 1,000 mL of normal saline and potassium supplementation before each amphotericin B infusion reduces the risk of nephrotoxicity during treatment (AII) . Infusion-related adverse reactions can be ameliorated by pretreatment with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Drug-Drug Interactions and Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Itraconazole and voriconazole and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs such as protease inhibitors (PIs), some integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) can have bi-directional interactions with each other, leading to increased or decreased drug concentrations (see Drug-Drug Interactions in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines ). Close monitoring is recommended when using these drugs together. In settings where therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is available, serum itraconazole and voriconazole levels should be obtained in all patients to ensure adequate drug exposure (BIII) . This is because itraconazole and voriconazole can interact with some ARV drugs, because absorption of itraconazole can be erratic, and because of the extensive interindividual variability and non-linear pharmacokinetics of voriconazole. The it is more bioavailable, itraconazole solution is preferred over the capsule formulation. Prevention and Management of IRIS Both unmasking and paradoxical IRIS have been described in patients with talaromycosis when ART is initiated. 57-59 In the IV AP trial, 188 of 432 (44%) patients had started ART a median of 3-4 months before developing talaromycosis, indicating the role of ART in the unmasking of subclinical infection in a significant proportion of patients. 55 This finding highlights the need for a sensitive assay to screen for subclinical infection and the importance of pre-emptive antifungal therapy to prevent disease and unmasking IRIS. In patients starting ART after a diagnosis of talaromycosis, paradoxical IRIS events only occurred in patients treated with itraconazole induction therapy, 55 demonstrating the role of effective induction therapy with amphotericin B in the prevention of paradoxical IRIS. ART should not be withheld because of concerns for possible development of IRIS (AIII) . Patients with paradoxical IRIS typically present with inflammatory manifestations that include erythematous or immunological skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, large and painful peripheral lymph nodes, and synovitis of small joints. Most symptoms can be managed by judicious use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory medicine. Corticosteroids are reserved for synovitis that interferes with daily function. 59 Although the IRIS events in the IV AP trial were not associated with increased mortality and were managed effectively with continuation of ART and antifungal therapy, they were associated with higher morbidity, including lower quality of life and increased diagnostic testing, duration of hospitalization, and cost. 55 Managing Treatment Failure and Relapse Talaromycosis treatment failure and disease relapse were associated with ineffective induction therapy with itraconazole, highlighting the importance of amphotericin B induction therapy. 55 On the basis of Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-7case series that included very few patients and on clinical experiences, voriconazole is an alternative therapy for patients who are unable to tolerate amphotericin B treatment (BII) . Disease relapse is associated with higher mortality55 and occurs mainly in patients who are not adherent to ART or have virologic failure, as well as in those who are not adherent to itraconazole consolidation or maintenance therapy. Therapy adherence counseling and TDM for itraconazole and voriconazole, if available, are recommended (AIII) . Preventing Recurrence When to Start Secondary Prophylaxis/Chronic Maintenance Therapy A study showed that >50% of patients not treated with ART had disease relapse within 6 months after discontinuation of antifungal therapy. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in Chiang Mai, Thailand, demonstrated that secondary prophylaxis with oral itraconazole 200 mg daily in patients with AIDS reduced the talaromycosis relapse rate from 57% to 0% ( P < 0.001). 56 All patients who successfully complete induction and consolidation treatment for talaromycosis should receive secondary prophylaxis (maintenance therapy) with oral itraconazole 200 mg/day until they reach criteria for stopping secondary prophylaxis (AI). When to Stop Secondary Prophylaxis/Chronic Maintenance Therapy No randomized, controlled study has demonstrated the safety of discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis for talaromycosis. However, a retrospective cohort study reported no relapse of talaromycosis after itraconazole was discontinued in patients receiving ART whose CD4 counts were >100 cells/ mm3.60 Therefore, secondary prophylaxis for talaromycosis can be discontinued in patients who are ART adherent and have CD4 counts >100 cells/ mm3 for at least 6 months (BII) . Secondary prophylaxis can reasonably be discontinued in patients with sustained virologic suppression for 6 months (BIII) . Secondary prophylaxis/chronic maintenance therapy should be reintroduced if CD4 count decreases to <100 cells/ mm3 (BIII) . Special Considerations During Pregnancy The diagnosis and treatment of talaromycosis during pregnancy is similar to that in non-pregnant adults, with the following considerations regarding antifungal use in pregnancy. Amphotericin B has not been shown to be teratogenic in animals, and no increase in fetal anomalies has been seen with its use in humans. Neonates born to women on chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. Itraconazole at high doses has been shown to be teratogenic in animals, but because humans lack the metabolic mechanism accounting for these defects, the animal teratogenicity data are not applicable to humans. Case series in humans do not suggest an increased risk of birth defects with itraconazole, but experience is very limited. 61 V oriconazole is Food and Drug Administration Category D because of teratogenicity (cleft palate and renal defects) seen in rats and embryotoxicity in rabbits. No human data on use of voriconazole are available, so use in the first trimester is not recommended. Substitution of amphotericin B for high-dose azoles in the first trimester is recommended (BIII) . Women on secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole or other azoles should postpone pregnancy until their CD4 counts have been restored with ART, such that prophylaxis can be discontinued (BIII) . If women become pregnant while receiving itraconazole prophylaxis, the decision as to whether to continue should be individualized based on current CD4 count and viral suppression and patient preference. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Z-8Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Talaromycosis Preventing First Episode of Talaromycosis (Primary Prophylaxis) Indication for Primary Prophylaxis: Persons with a CD4 count <100 cells/mm3, who are unable to have ART, or have treatment failure without access to effective ART options and who either: Reside in the highly endemic regions in northern Thailand, throughout Vietnam, and southern China (particularly in highland re gions during the rainy humid months) (BI), or Are from countries outside of the endemic region and must travel to the region (BIII). Primary ProphylaxisFor Individuals Residing in Endemic Areas: Preferred Therapy: Itraconazole 200 mg PO once daily (BI) Alternative Therapy: Fluconazole 400 mg PO once weekly (BII) For Individuals Traveling to Endemic Areas: Preferred Therapy: Begin itraconazole 200 mg PO once daily 3 days before travel and continue for 1 week after leaving the endem ic area (BIII). Alternative Therapy: Begin fluconazole 400 mg 3 days before travel, then continue 400 mg once weekly while in the area, and tak e final dose after leaving the endemic area (BIII). Indication for Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis for Persons who Reside in Endemic Areas: CD4 count >100 cells/mm3 for 6 months in response to ART (BII) Viral load suppression for 6 months on ART (BIII) Indication for Restarting Primary Prophylaxis: CD4 count decreases to <100 cells/mm3 (BIII) and patient still resides in or travels to high-risk areas. Primary prophylaxis for travelers may begin three days prior to travel to allow serum drug level to reach steady state and may continue for one week after travel (BIII). Treating Acute Infection in Severely Ill Patients Preferred Therapy: Induction therapy with liposomal amphotericin B 3 to 5 mg/kg/day IV for 2 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with itracon azole 200 mg PO twice daily for 10 weeks (AI), followed by maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole 200 mg PO daily (AII) Alternative Therapy: In settings where liposomal amphotericin B is not available, induction therapy with deoxycholate amphotericin B 0.7 mg/kg/day I V for 2 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with itraconazole 200 mg PO twice daily for 10 weeks (AI), followed by maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole 200 mg PO daily (AII) In settings where amphotericin B is not available, induction therapy with voriconazole 6 mg/kg IV ever y 12 hours for 1 day (loading dose) and then voriconazole 4 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 2 weeks, or oral voriconazole 600 mg every 12 hours on day 1 (loading dose) and then voriconazole 400 mg PO every12 hours for 2 weeks; followed by consolidation therapy with voriconazole 200 mg PO twice daily or itraconazole 200 mg PO twice daily for a maximum of 10 weeks (BII); followed by maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole 200 mg PO daily (AII) Itraconazole is not recommended as induction therapy for talaromycosis (AI). Criteria for Discontinuing Chronic Maintenance Therapy: CD4 count >100 cells/mm3 for 6 months in response to ART (BII) Virologic suppression for 6 months on ART (BIII) Criteria for Restarting Chronic Maintenance Therapy: CD4 count decreases to <100 cells/mm3 (AIII) Other Considerations AR T can be initiated as early as one week after the initiation of treatment for talaromycosis with amphotericin B induction therapy to improve outcomes (BII). Given erratic absorption of itraconazole, extensive interindividual variability and non-linear PKs of voriconazole, and the pot ential for drug interactions with ARV drugs, itraconazole and voriconazole concentrations should be monitored, and serum trough concentration should be >0.5 \u00b5g/mL and can have significant drug-drug interactions with various ARV drugs; dosage adjustment may be necessary, and TDM to guide therapy can be considered (see the Drug-Drug Interactions tables in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for further recommendations).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-1Toxoplasma gondii Encephalitis (Last updated July 25, 2017; last reviewed June 26, 2019) Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) is caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. Disease appears to occur almost exclusively because of reactivation of latent tissue cysts.1-4 Primary infection occasionally is associated with acute cerebral or disseminated disease. Epidemiology Seroprevalence of anti- Toxoplasma antibody varies substantially among different geographic locales, with a prevalence of approximately 11% in the United States, versus 50% to 80% in certain European, Latin American, and African countries.4-6 In the era before antiretroviral therapy (ART), the 12-month incidence of TE was approximately 33% in patients with advanced immunosuppression who were seropositive for T. gondii and not receiving prophylaxis with drugs against the disease. A low incidence of toxoplasmosis is seen in patients who are seronegative for T. gondii. If patients are truly seronegative, their toxoplasmosis presumably represents one of three possible scenarios: 1) Primary infection, 2) Re-activation of latent disease in individuals who cannot produce detectable antibodies, or 3) T esting with insensitive assays.7,8 Clinical disease is rare among patients with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts >200 cells/\u00b5L. counts <50 cells/\u00b5L are at greatest risk.1,3,8,9 Primary infection occurs after eating undercooked meat containing tissue cysts or ingesting oocysts that have been shed in cat feces and sporulated in the environment, a process that takes at least 24 hours. In the United States, eating raw shellfish including oysters, clams, and mussels recently was identified as a novel risk factor for acute infection. 10 Up to 50% of individuals with documented primary infection do not have an identifiable risk factor.11 Patients may be infected with the parasite even in the absence of conventional risk factors for infection in their epidemiological history. The organism is not transmitted through person-to-person contact. Clinical Manifestations Among patients with AIDS, the most common clinical presentation of T. gondii infection is focal encephalitis with headache, confusion, or motor weakness and fever.1,3,9 Patients may also present with non-focal manifestations, including only non-specific headache and psychiatric symptoms. Focal neurological abnormalities may be present on physical examination, and in the absence of treatment, disease progression results in seizures, stupor, coma, and death. Retinochoroiditis, pneumonia, and evidence of other multifocal organ system involvement can occur but are rare in patients with AIDS. Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain will typically show multiple contrast-enhancing lesions in the grey matter of the cortex or basal ganglia, often with associated edema. 1,9,12-14 Toxoplasmosis also can manifest as a single brain lesion or diffuse encephalitis without evidence of focal brain lesions on imaging studies.15 This latter presentation tends to be rapidly progressive and fatal. Diagnosis HIV-infected patients with TE are almost uniformly seropositive for anti-toxoplasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. 1,3,9,16 The absence of IgG antibody makes a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis unlikely but not impossible. Anti-toxoplasma immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies usually are absent. Quantitative antibody titers are not useful for diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of TE requires a compatible clinical syndrome; identification of one or more mass lesions by CT or MRI, and detection of the organism in a clinical sample. On imaging studies, lesions are usually ring-enhancing and have a predilection for the basal ganglia. MRI has sensitivity superior to that of CT studies Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-2for radiological diagnosis of TE. MRI should be obtained in patients with equivocal or negative CT studies. Positron emission tomography13 or single-photon emission computed tomography scanning14 may be helpful in distinguishing between TE and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, but no imaging technique is completely specific. For TE, detection of the organism requires a brain biopsy, which is most commonly performed by a stereotactic CT-guided needle biopsy. Hematoxylin and eosin stains can be used for detection of T. gondii, but sensitivity is significantly increased if immunoperoxidase staining is used and if experienced laboratories process the specimens. 17 If safe and feasible, a lumbar puncture should be performed for T. gondii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as for cytology, culture, cryptococcal antigen and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and JC Virus (JCV), either at initial presentation or subsequently, especially in patients in whom empiric therapy fails. Detection of T. gondii by PCR in CSF has high specificity (96%-100%), but low sensitivity (50%), especially once specific anti-toxoplasma therapy has been started. 18-20 The differential diagnosis of focal neurological disease in patients with AIDS most often includes primary CNS lymphoma and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML). In the absence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), PML (but not lymphoma) can be distinguished on the basis of imaging studies. PML lesions typically involve white matter rather than gray matter, are non-contrast enhancing, and produce no mass effect. Less common causes of focal neurologic disease in patients with AIDS include mycobacterial infection (especially tuberculosis [TB]); fungal infection, such as cryptococcosis; Chagas disease; and pyogenic brain abscess, particularly in IV drug abusers. Most clinicians initially rely on an empiric diagnosis, which can be established as an objective response, documented by clinical and radiographic improvement, to specific anti-T. gondii therapy in the absence of a likely alternative diagnosis. Brain biopsy is reserved for patients who fail to respond to specific therapy, although earlier biopsy should be strongly considered if results from imaging, serology, or CSF PCR studies are negative and/or suggest an etiology other than toxoplasmosis. In patients with contrast-enhancing mass lesions, detection of EBV and JCV by PCR in CSF is highly suggestive CNS lymphoma 21,22 or PML,23 respectively. Preventing Exposure HIV-infected individuals should be tested for IgG antibody to Toxoplasma soon after they are diagnosed with HIV to detect latent infection with T. gondii (BIII). They also should be counseled regarding sources of Toxoplasma infection, especially if they lack IgG antibody to Toxoplasma. To minimize risk of acquiring toxoplasmosis, HIV-infected individuals should be advised not to eat raw or undercooked meat, including undercooked lamb, beef, pork, or venison, and not to eat raw shellfish including oysters, clams, and mussels (BIII). Lamb, beef, venison, and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F; 24 meat cooked until it is no longer pink inside usually has an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F, and therefore, from a more practical perspective, satisfies this requirement. To minimize the risk for acquiring toxoplasmosis, HIV-infected individuals should wash their hands after contact with raw meat and after gardening or other contact with soil; they should also wash fruits and vegetables well before eating them raw (BIII). Patients who are seronegative and who own cats should be advised to have someone who is HIV-negative and not pregnant change the litter box daily. If they must change the litter box themselves, they should wear gloves and wash their hands thoroughly afterwards (BIII). HIV-infected patients also should be encouraged to keep their cats inside and not to adopt or handle stray cats (BIII). Cats should be fed only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats (BIII). Patients do not need to be advised to part with their cats or to have their cats tested for toxoplasmosis (AII). Preventing Disease Indication for Primary Prophylaxis Toxoplasma-seropositive patients who have CD4 counts <100 cells/\u00b5L should receive prophylaxis against TE (AII).25,26 All patients at risk for toxoplasmosis are also at risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-3(PCP), and should be receiving PCP prophylaxis. They should be managed as follows: patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis no patients receiving dapsone should have pyrimethamine plus leucovorin added to the regimen or be switched to TMP-SMX or atovaquone; patients receiving aerosol pentamidine should be switched if possible to a regimen which also has anti-toxoplasma activity, i.e. switching to either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or atovaquone if that is feasible. For patients in whom other alternatives are not possible, pyrimethamine alone (plus leucovorin) may have some efficacy as primary prophylaxis (CIII) . 8 The double-strength-tablet daily dose of TMP-SMX, which is the preferred regimen for PCP prophylaxis, is also effective against TE and is recommended (AII). TMP-SMX, one double-strength tablet three times weekly, is an alternative (BIII). If patients cannot tolerate TMP-SMX, the recommended alternative is dapsone-pyrimethamine plus leucovorin, which is also effective against PCP (BI). 27-29 Atovaquone with or without pyrimethamine/leucovorin is active against PCP and also can be considered for toxoplasmosis as well as PCP, (CIII) . Aerosolized pentamidine does not protect against TE and is not recommended for antitoxoplasma prophylaxis (AI). 25,30 Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis Prophylaxis against TE should be discontinued in adult and adolescent patients receiving ART whose CD4 counts increase to >200 cells/\u00b5L for more than 3 months (AI). Multiple observational studies 31-33 and two randomized trials34,35 have reported that primary prophylaxis can be discontinued, with minimal risk for development of TE, in patients receiving ART whose CD4 counts increase from <200 cells/\u00b5L to >200 cells/\u00b5L for more than 3 months. In these studies, most patients were taking HIV protease inhibitor-containing regimens and the median CD4 count at the time prophylaxis was discontinued was >300 cells/\u00b5L. At the time prophylaxis was discontinued, most patients had sustained suppression of plasma HIV RNA levels below the detection limits of available assays; the median follow-up was 7 to 22 months. CD4 count increases to >200 cells/\u00b5L were studied because regimens used for prophylaxis of TE also provide PCP prophylaxis, and the risk of PCP in untreated patients increases once the CD4 count is <200 cells/\u00b5L. Thus, the recommendation specifies discontinuing prophylaxis after an increase to >200 cells/\u00b5L. When CD4 counts are >200 cells/L for at least 3 months, primary TE prophylaxis should be discontinued because it adds little value in preventing toxoplasmosis and increases pill burden, potential for drug toxicity and interaction, likelihood of development of drug-resistant pathogens, and cost. A combined analysis of 10 European cohorts found a low incidence of TE in patients with CD4 counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm 3, who were receiving ART and had HIV RNA plasma viral loads <400 copies/mL, and who had stopped or never received TE prophylaxis, suggesting that primary TE prophylaxis can be safely discontinued in patients with CD4 counts 100 to 200 cells/mm 3 and HIV plasma RNA levels below limits of detection with commercial assays.36 Similar observations have been made with regard to stopping primary or secondary prophylaxis for PCP.36-38 Data on which to base specific recommendations are inadequate, but one approach would be to stop primary prophylaxis in patients with CD4 counts of 100 to 200 cells/mm 3 if HIV plasma RNA levels remain below limits of detection for at least 3 to 6 months (BII).36 Treating Disease The initial therapy of choice for TE consists of the combination of pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine plus leucovorin (AI). 2,39-41 Pyrimethamine penetrates the parenchyma efficiently even in the absence of inflammation.42 Leucovorin reduces the likelihood of development of hematologic pyrimethamine therapy.43 Pyrimethamine plus clindamycin plus leucovorin (AI)39,40 is the preferred alternative regimen for patients with TE who cannot tolerate sulfadiazine or do not respond to first-line therapy. This combination, however, does not prevent PCP, therefore additional PCP prophylaxis must be administered when it is used (AII) (see discussion under Preventing Recurrence ). In a small (77 patients) randomized trial, TMP-SMX was reported to be effective and better tolerated than pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine. 44 Others have reported similar efficacy in open-label observational studies.45 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-4TMP-SMX has less in vitro activity and experience using this drug to treat toxoplasmosis in developed countries is limited. However, if pyrimethamine is unavailable or there is a delay in obtaining it, TMP-SMX should be utilized in place of pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine or pyrimethamine-clindamycin (BI). For patients with a history of sulfa allergy, sulfa desensitization should be attempted using one of several published strategies (BI). 46-51 During the desensitization period, atovaquone with or without pyrimethamine should be administered until therapeutic doses of TMP-SMX are achieved (CIII). No well-studied options exist for patients who cannot take an oral regimen. No parenteral formulation of pyrimethamine exists and the only widely available parenteral sulfonamide is the sulfamethoxazole component of TMP-SMX. Some specialists will use parenteral TMP-SMX (BI) or oral pyrimethamine plus parenteral clindamycin (CIII) as initial treatment in severely ill patients who require parenteral therapy. Atovaquone (with meals or oral nutritional supplements) plus pyrimethamine plus leucovorin, or atovaquone plus sulfadiazine, or, for patients intolerant of both pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, atovaquone as a single agent, have also been shown to be effective in treating TE, although the relative efficacy compared with the previous regimens is unknown. (BII) 52,53,54 If atovaquone is used alone, clinicians should be aware that the absorption of the drug from patient to patient is highly variable; plasma levels >18.5 \u00b5g/mL are associated with an improved response rate but atovaquone therapeutic drug monitoring is not routinely available. 53-55 The following regimens have been reported to have activity in treatment of TE in small cohorts of patients or in case reports of one or several patients: azithromycin plus clarithromycin (CIII) .61,62 Although the clarithromycin dose used in the only published study was 1g twice a day, doses >500 mg have been associated with increased mortality in HIV-infected patients treated for disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex. Doses >500 mg twice a day should not be used (BIII). Clinical response to acute therapy occurs in 90% of patients with TE within 14 days of initiation of appropriate anti-toxoplasma treatment. 2 The reasons why some patients fail therapy are not clearly proven; whether such failures are due to poor adherence or to other host factors or antimicrobial resistance has not been well delineated. Acute therapy for TE should be continued for at least 6 weeks, if there is clinical and radiologic improvement (BII). 1-4 Longer courses may be necessary if clinical or radiologic disease is extensive or response is incomplete at 6 weeks. After completion of the acute therapy, all patients should be continued on chronic maintenance therapy as outlined below (see Preventing Recurrence section below). The radiologic goals for treatment include resolution of the lesion(s) in terms of size, contrast enhancement, and associated edema, although residual contrast-enhancing lesions may persist for prolonged periods. Adjunctive corticosteroids such as dexamethasone should only be administered to patients with TE when they are clinically indicated to treat a mass effect associated with focal lesions or associated edema (BIII). In those treated with corticosteroids, caution may be needed in diagnosing CNS toxoplasmosis on the basis of treatment response, since primary CNS lymphoma may respond clinically and radiographically to corticosteroids alone; these patients should be monitored carefully as corticosteroids are tapered. In addition, corticosteroids should be discontinued as soon as clinically feasible because of their potential to cause immunosuppression. Patients receiving corticosteroids should be monitored closely for development of other opportunistic infections (OIs), including cytomegalovirus retinitis and TB. Anticonvulsants should be administered to patients with TE who have a history of seizures (AII), but should not be administered prophylactically to all patients (BII). Anticonvulsants, if indicated, should be continued at least through the period of acute therapy. Special Considerations with Regard to Starting ART There are no data on which to base a recommendation regarding when to start ART in a patient with TE. However, many physicians would initiate ART within 2 to 3 weeks after the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis (CIII) , based on the significantly lower incidence of AIDS progression or death (a secondary study endpoint) seen in the ART arm of a controlled trial of 282 patients with OIs other than TB (only 5% of whom had toxoplasmosis) Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-5who were randomized to early (median 12 days after initiation of OI therapy) versus deferred (median 45 days) initiation of ART.63 Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (including IRIS) Changes in antibody titers are not useful for monitoring responses to therapy. Patients with TE should be monitored routinely for adverse events and clinical and radiologic improvement (AIII). Common pyrimethamine toxicities such as rash, nausea, and bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) often can be reversed by increasing the leucovorin dose to 10, 25, or 50 mg 4 times daily (CIII). Common sulfadiazine toxicities include rash, fever, leukopenia, hepatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, renal insufficiency, and crystalluria. Common clindamycin toxicities include fever, rash, nausea, diarrhea (including pseudomembranous colitis or diarrhea related to Clostridium difficile toxin), and hepatotoxicity. Common TMP-SMX thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity. Common atovaquone toxicities include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache, hepatotoxicity, and fever. Drug interactions between anticonvulsants and antiretroviral agents should be evaluated carefully; if necessary, doses should be adjusted or alternative anticonvulsants should be used. IRIS associated with TE has been reported but appears to be rare (~5% in one report). 64-66 Most cases develop as paradoxical worsening with increase in the size and number of lesions, peri-lesional edema, and greater enhancement in T1.65,67,68 Given the rarity of TE-associated IRIS, recommendations for management of such events are difficult to develop. Managing Treatment Failure A brain biopsy should be strongly considered in patients who did not have an initial biopsy prior to therapy and who fail to respond to initial therapy for TE (BII) as defined by clinical or radiologic deterioration during the first week despite adequate therapy, or who do not show clinical improvement within 10 to 14 days. A switch to an alternative regimen, as previously described, should be considered for those who undergo brain biopsy and have confirmed histopathologic evidence of TE, or who have a CSF PCR positive for T. gondii (BIII). In patients who adhere to their regimens, disease recurrence is unusual in the setting of chronic maintenance therapy after an initial clinical and radiographic response. Preventing Recurrence When to Start Chronic Maintenance Therapy Patients who have completed initial therapy for TE should be given chronic maintenance therapy to suppress infection (AI)39,40 until immune reconstitution occurs as a consequence of ART, in which case treatment discontinuation is indicated. The combination of pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine plus leucovorin is highly effective as suppressive therapy for patients with TE (AI) and provides protection against PCP (AII). Although sulfadiazine is routinely dosed as a four-times-a-day regimen, a pharmacokinetic study suggests bioequivalence for the same total daily dose when given either twice or four times a day, 69 and limited clinical experience suggests that twice-daily dosing is effective.70 Pyrimethamine plus clindamycin is commonly used as suppressive therapy for patients with TE who cannot tolerate sulfa drugs (BI). Because of the high failure rate observed with lower doses,39 a dose of 600 mg clindamycin every 8 hours is recommended (CIII) . Because this regimen does not provide protection against PCP (AII), an additional agent, such as aerosol pentamidine, must be used. Atovaquone with or without pyrimethamine or sulfadiazine is also active against both TE 54,55 and PCP71 (BII). A small, uncontrolled study in patients who had been receiving ART for a median of 13 months suggested that TMP-SMX could be used as a suppressive regimen to reduce pill burden. 72 For patients being treated with TMP-SMX, this drug should be continued as chronic maintenance, at a reduced dose of 1 double-strength tablet twice daily (BII) or once daily (BII). The lower dose may be associated with an increased risk of relapse, and if the once daily dosing is used, a gradual transition may be beneficial (e.g. follow acute therapy with 4-6 weeks of 1 double-strength tablet twice daily Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-6before lowering to 1 double-strength tablet once daily (CIII) .44,45,72 Although there are no data on the long-term suppressive efficacy of the other alternative regimens noted above, clinicians might consider using these agents in unusual situations in which the recommended agents cannot be administered (CIII) . When to Stop Chronic Maintenance Therappy Adult and adolescent patients receiving chronic maintenance therapy for TE are at low risk for recurrence of TE if they have successfully completed initial therapy for TE, remain asymptomatic with regard to signs and symptoms of TE, and have an increase in their CD4 counts to >200 cells/\u00b5L after ART that is sustained for more than 6 months. 32,35,73,74 Discontinuing chronic maintenance therapy in such patients is a reasonable consideration, although occasional recurrences have been reported. The recommendation is based on results in a limited number of patients from observational studies and one randomized clinical trial and inference from more extensive cumulative data indicating the safety of discontinuing secondary prophylaxis for other OIs during advanced disease (BI). As part of the evaluation to determine whether discontinuation of therapy is appropriate, some specialists recommend obtaining an MRI of the brain to assess for resolution of brain lesions. When to Restart Primary Prophylaxis or Maintenance Therapy Primary prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the CD4 count decreases to <100 cells/mm3 (AIII) regardless of the HIV plasma viral load. Based on results from the COHERE study, primary prophylaxis may not need to be restarted in patients with CD4 counts of 100 to 200 cells/mm 3 who have had HIV plasma RNA levels below limits of detection for at least 3 to 6 months (BII).36,37 For patients with CD4 counts of 100-200 cells/\u00b5L with HIV plasma viral load above detection limits of the utilized assay, PCP prophylaxis should be reintroduced, and this will provide prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis as well. Because there are no published data examining the risk of recurrence in patients stopping chronic maintenance therapy for TE when the CD4 count is between 100 and 200 cells/\u00b5L, and recurrent TE can be debilitating and potentially life-threatening, maintenance therapy should be reintroduced if the CD4 count decreases to <200 cells/\u00b5L (AIII) regardless of the HIV plasma viral load. 75 Special Considerations During Pregnancy Documentation of baseline maternal T. gondii serologic status (IgG) should be obtained in HIV-infected women who become pregnant because of concerns regarding congenital toxoplasmosis. Although perinatal transmission of T. gondii normally occurs only with acute infection in the immunocompetent host, case reports have documented transmission with reactivation of chronic infection in HIV-infected women with severe immunosuppression. 76,77 Knowing maternal toxoplasmosis sero-status at the beginning of pregnancy may be helpful in delineating future risks and interpreting serologic testing performed later in pregnancy should there be heightened concerns for maternal infection and/or fetal transmission. Primary T. gondii infection can typically be distinguished from chronic infection with the use of multiple serologic assays, including IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE antibodies; and the differential agglutination tests. 78,79 Because serologic testing is often difficult to interpret, pregnant HIV-infected women with suspected primary T. gondii infection during pregnancy should be managed in consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who can access specialized laboratory testing (BIII) 79,80 (e.g., the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Toxoplasmosis Palo Alto, CA; Toxoplasmosis diagnostic considerations are the same in pregnant women as in non-pregnant women. While maternal infection is usually asymptomatic, after a 5-23 day incubation period, non-specific symptoms may develop including fever, fatigue, headache, and myalgia. Parasitemia can seed the placenta and lead to Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-7fetal infection. With respect to congential toxoplasmosis, the risk of transmission is highest in the setting of an acute maternal infection as compared to reactivation. While the risk of transmission increases with advancing gestational age, the severity of fetal sequelae is more pronounced the earlier in gestation the fetus is affected. 81 Detailed ultrasound examination of the fetus specifically evaluating for hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications, and growth restriction should be done for HIV-infected women with suspected primary or symptomatic reactivation of T. gondii during pregnancy (AIII) . 79 Prenatal diagnosis requires an amniocentesis with PCR testing for T. gondii DNA in the amniotic fluid.82 Amniocentesis does not appear to increase the risk of perinatal HIV transmission, particularly in women receiving HAART.83 Therefore, PCR of amniotic fluid can be considered during gestation in pregnant women on ART with serologic evidence of recently acquired infection, women suspected to have reactivated their toxoplasma latent infection during pregnancy, and those with ultrasound findings suggestive of fetal T. gondii infection (BIII). 79 Amniotic fluid testing for T. gondii PCR should be avoided at less than 18-week gestation. in an effort to minimize false-negative results. 84 Because the risk for transmission with chronic infection that does not reactivate during gestation appears to be low, routine fetal evaluation for infection with amniocentesis is not indicated. Pediatric-care providers should be informed about HIV-infected mothers who have suspected or confirmed T. gondii infection to allow evaluation of their neonates for evidence of congenital infection (AIII) . Indications for treatment of T. gondii during pregnancy should be based on confirmed or suspected infection in the mother and the risk of transmission of the parasite from mother to fetus. The value of routine toxoplasmosis screening programs is debated in the United States but generally accepted in other countries. In countries such as France where pregnant women are universally screened and treated, infected offspring are reported to have primarily mild disease and rarely severe disease. In contrast, in countries without a universal screening program (e.g. United States), infected offspring mostly present with severe disease. 85 Pregnant HIV-infected women who have evidence of primary toxoplasmic infection, without TE, should be evaluated and managed during pregnancy in consultation with appropriate specialists (BIII). Studies published since 2007 support treatment of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy in an effort to decrease vertical transmission and reduce the severity of clinical signs in the offspring. 86-89 In the setting of primary infection during pregnancy, spiramcyin is recommended to prevent congenital transmission. Spiramycin is not commercially available in the United States but can be obtained at no cost after consultation with PAMF-TSL, telephone number (650) 853-4828, or the US [Chicago, Trial Study [NCCTS], telephone number (773) 834-4152) through the US Food and Drug Administration, telephone number (301) 796-1400. It is administered orally at a dosage of 1.0 g (or 3 million U) every 8 h (total dosage of 3 g or 9 million U per day). Spiramcyn is not teratogenic, does not treat infection in the fetus and is primarily indicated for fetal prophylaxis. Spiramycin should be continued until delivery in women with low suspicion of fetal infection or those with documented negative results of amniotic fluid PCR and negative findings on ultrasounds at follow-up. Pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine/leucovorin is recommended for pregnant women with a strong suspicion of fetal infection: those suspected of having acquired the infection at 18 weeks of gestation, 90 those with positive AF PCR, or those with ultrasounds suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine should not be used in the first trimester because of teratogenicity concerns. The combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine can decrease disease severity. Treatment of pregnant women with TE should be the same as in non-pregnant adults (BIII), including pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine plus leucovorin (AI), and in consultation with appropriate specialists (BIII). 2,39-41 Of note, this regimen is often used to treat the infected fetus.79 Although pyrimethamine has been associated with birth defects in animals, human data have not suggested an increased risk for defects, therefore, it can be administered to pregnant women after the first trimester. 77,91-94 Similarly, sulfadiazine appears safe in pregnancy.95 A randomized, controlled trial published in 1956 found that premature infants receiving prophylactic penicillin/sulfisoxazole were at significantly higher risk of mortality (specifically kernicterus), compared with infants who received oxytetracycline. 96 Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV AA-8Because of these findings, some clinicians are concerned about the risk of neonatal kernicterus in the setting of maternal use of sulfa (including sulfadiazine) near delivery, although are no studies published to date link late third-trimester maternal sulfa use and neonatal death or kernicterus. The infant's care provider should be notified of maternal sulfa use in late pregnancy. The preferred alternative regimen for patients with TE who are unable to tolerate or who fail to respond to first-line therapy is pyrimethamine plus clindamycin plus leucovorin (AI). 39,40 Clindamycin is considered safe throughout pregnancy. Atovaquone may be used if indicated. While there are limited data on atovaquone safety in humans, preclinical studies have not demonstrated toxicity. 92 TMP-SMX can be administered for primary prophylaxis against TE as described for PCP (AIII). The risks of TMP-SMX in the first trimester, as discussed for PCP, must be balanced against the risk of TE. Maintenance therapy should be provided, using the same indications as for non-pregnant women. As noted above, pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are considered safe in pregnancy. Clindamycin may be substituted for sulfadiazine for sulfa-intolerant patients. Dapsone appears to cross the placenta. 97,98 Over the past several decades, dapsone (used for primary prophylaxis) has been used safely in pregnancy to treat leprosy, malaria, and various dermatologic conditions. 98,99 With long-term therapy, there is a risk of mild maternal hemolysis and a potential\u2014although extremely low\u2014 risk of hemolytic anemia in exposed fetuses with G6PD deficiency.100 When providing preconception care for HIV-infected women receiving TE prophylaxis, providers should discuss the option of deferring pregnancy until TE prophylaxis can be safely discontinued (BIII).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-1Varicella-Zoster Virus Diseases (Last updated September 5, 2019; last reviewed September 5, 2019) Epidemiology More than 95% of adults (aged >20 years) born in the United States have immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV), mostly due to primary VZV infection, known as varicella (or chickenpox).1 A varicella vaccine became available in the United States in 1995; most children born in the United States after 2005 are immune to varicella as a result of vaccination. 2 Reactivation of latent VZV results in herpes zoster (shingles). In the general population, the incidence of herpes zoster is about 3.6 cases per 1,000 person-years, with much higher incidence seen among elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Before the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of herpes zoster was more than 15-fold higher among adults with HIV than among age-matched controls without HIV . 3,4 Herpes zoster can occur in adults with HIV at any CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count, but the risk of disease is higher with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3.5-8 In addition, HIV viremia is associated with an increased risk for incident herpes zoster.9 ART has been shown to reduce the incidence of herpes zoster in adults with HIV , presumably because of immune restoration, although the risk of herpes zoster remains three-fold higher in adults with HIV than in the general population. 7,10-13 Several studies have demonstrated that the risk of herpes zoster in adults with HIV is increased in the 6-month period immediately after initiation of ART, possibly because of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)-related mechanism. 7,10,13,14 Clinical Manifestations Varicella rash tends to have a central distribution with lesions first appearing on the head, then the trunk, and finally the extremities, evolving through stages of macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts. The rash is characterized by rapid evolution of lesions during the initial 8 to 12 hours after onset, by successive crops of new lesions, and by the presence of lesions in different stages of development. New vesicle formation continues for 2 days to 4 days, accompanied by pruritus, fever, headache, malaise, and anorexia. 15 Primary varicella can cause substantial morbidity in adolescents and adults with HIV . Visceral dissemination, especially VZV pneumonitis, is well documented. 15 Because most adults with HIV in the United States are VZV seropositive, primary varicella is an uncommon occurrence in this population. Herpes zoster manifests as a painful cutaneous eruption in a dermatomal distribution, often preceded by prodromal pain. The most common sites for herpes zoster are the thoracic dermatomes (40% to 50% of followed by changes begin with an erythematous maculopapular rash, followed by the appearance of clear vesicles and accompanied by pain, which may be severe. New vesicle formation typically continues for 3 to 5 days, followed by lesion pustulation and scabbing. Crusts typically persist for 2 to 3 weeks. About 20% to 30% of patients with HIV have one or more subsequent episodes of herpes zoster, which may involve the same or different dermatomes. The probability of a recurrence of herpes zoster within 1 year of the index episode is approximately 10%. 5,17 Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with HIV report post-herpetic neuralgia as a complication following herpes zoster.5,18 When herpes zoster involves the nasociliary branch of the trigeminal nerve, the eye can be affected (herpes zoster ophthalmicus [HZO]), resulting in keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) or anterior uveitis (inflammation of the iris and anterior ciliary body) or both. Vesicles on the tip of the nose (Hutchinson sign) are a clue that the nasociliary branch is involved. With corneal involvement, there may be an initial brief period during which the corneal epithelium is infected with VZV , but the major problem is inflammation of the corneal stroma, which can result in scarring, neovascularization, or necrosis, with loss of vision. Stromal keratitis can be chronic. Once it occurs, VZV-associated anterior uveitis also tends to be chronic and can result in increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma, scarring of intraocular tissues, and cataract. Stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis may not develop immediately after the appearance of skin vesicles on Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-2the forehead and scalp. Therefore, patients with normal eye examinations initially should receive follow-up eye examinations, even after the skin lesions heal. Antiviral treatment of herpes zoster at the onset of cutaneous lesions reduces the incidence and severity of ophthalmic involvement. Some patients with HZO may develop late dendriform lesions of the corneal epithelium that contain virus and will respond rapidly to systemic or topical anti-herpetic medications. These lesions are usually painful. In one study, the median time from onset of HZO to development of late dendriform lesions was 5 months, and the risk of recurrences decreased over time. 19 The frequency with which these late infectious lesions occur has not been determined. Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) and progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN) are variants of necrotizing retinopathy caused by VZV . Although ARN can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, PORN occurs almost exclusively in patients with AIDS with CD4 counts <100 cells/mm 3.20 In contrast to ARN, PORN is characterized by minimal inflammation in the aqueous and vitreous humor, absence of occlusive retinal vasculitis, and multiple discrete peripheral lesions that manifest initially as yellow foci of retinal opacification in the outer retinal layers. 21 PORN lesions rapidly coalesce, causing full-thickness retinal necrosis and subsequent retinal detachment.22 Both ARN and PORN are associated with high rates of loss of vision. Patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 are at highest risk of herpes zoster-related complications, including disseminated herpes zoster.23 The central nervous system (CNS) is a target organ for herpes zoster dissemination in patients who also have HIV . Various VZV-related neurologic syndromes occur 24 Diagnosis Varicella and herpes zoster are typically distinctive in appearance and can usually be clinically diagnosed. Varicella can also be diagnosed retrospectively by documenting seroconversion (i.e., immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibody negative to positive). In immunocompromised persons, varicella may be difficult to distinguish from disseminated herpes zoster (as opposed to dermatomal herpes zoster); a history of VZV exposure, a rash that began with a dermatomal pattern, and VZV serologic testing to assess prior VZV infection may be helpful to distinguish disseminated herpes zoster from varicella. When lesions are atypical or difficult to distinguish from those due to other potential etiologies (including herpes simplex virus [HSV]), swabs of vesicular fluid from a fresh lesion or tissue biopsies can be submitted for viral culture, direct fluorescent antigen testing, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additionally, scabs may be adequate specimens for PCR testing. PCR of lesions is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of VZV infections. Histopathology and PCR (of blood or fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or vitreous humor) can aid with diagnosis of VZV infections of visceral organs (e.g., pneumonitis, encephalitis, retinitis). 25 Preventing Exposure Persons with HIV who are susceptible to VZV (i.e., persons who have no history of chickenpox or shingles, who are seronegative for VZV , and who have no history of vaccination against VZV) should avoid exposure to individuals with varicella or herpes zoster (CIII) . Household contacts of persons with HIV without evidence of immunity to VZV should be vaccinated to prevent acquisition of varicella and potential transmission of wild-type VZV to susceptible contacts with HIV (BIII). Preventing Disease Vaccination to Prevent Primary Infection (Varicella) The live attenuated varicella vaccine (Varivax\u00ae) has been documented to be safe and immunogenic in children with HIV who have relatively preserved immune systems (CD4 percentage 15%)26-29 and is recommended Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-3for this population of children with HIV .30 Varicella vaccination of children with HIV also reduces the risk of subsequent herpes zoster.29,31 VZV-seronegative adults are potential candidates for varicella vaccination. Some experts would serologically screen adults with HIV without a history of prior varicella or varicella vaccination for VZV IgG. However, the value of this approach may be limited by the lack of sensitivity of commercially available VZV antibody assays (particularly for vaccine-induced antibody). 32,33 No studies have evaluated the vaccine in adolescents or adults with HIV , but many experts recommend varicella vaccination (2 doses, administered 3 months apart) for VZV-susceptible persons with HIV aged 8 years with CD4 counts 200 cells/mm 3 (BIII).34 If varicella vaccination results in disease caused by vaccine virus (a rare event), therapy with acyclovir is recommended (AIII) . Administration of varicella vaccine to more severely immunocompromised patients with HIV (CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3) is contraindicated (AIII). Given the high prevalence of VZV seropositivity in adults, administration of varicella vaccine for adults will be infrequent. If post-exposure varicella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIG) has been administered, an interval of 5 months is recommended before varicella vaccination (CIII) .35 If post-exposure acyclovir has been administered, an interval of 3 days is recommended before varicella vaccination (CIII) . Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis to Prevent Primary with anti-VZV drugs, such as acyclovir or to prevent varicella is not recommended (AIII). Post-Exposure Prophylaxis to Prevent Primary Infection (Varicella) For persons with HIV who are susceptible to VZV , post-exposure prophylaxis following known or suspected VZV exposure is recommended (AII). After close contact with a person who has active varicella or herpes zoster, adolescents and adults with HIV who are susceptible to VZV (particularly those with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3) should receive VariZIG as soon as possible (preferably within 96 hours), but up to 10 days after exposure (AIII) .36 Given the cost of obtaining VariZIG, it is reasonable to check VZV serology before administering VariZIG to persons who do not have a clinical history of chickenpox or shingles and no documentation of varicella vaccination (AIII) . The risk of VZV transmission is greater with exposure to varicella than localized herpes zoster. In the United States, VariZIG is commercially available from a broad network of specialty distributers (listed at: www.varizig.com). The duration of protection from VariZIG is at least 3 weeks. Patients receiving monthly infusions of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG >400 mg/kg) are likely to be protected and probably do not require VariZIG if they received a dose of IVIG <3 weeks before VZV exposure. A 5 day to 7 day course of post-exposure acyclovir or valacyclovir beginning 7 days to 10 days after exposure is recommended by some experts to prevent varicella among VZV-susceptible adolescents or adults with HIV , but this intervention has not been studied in these populations (BIII). 37 Among VZV-susceptible immunocompetent children, post-exposure varicella vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk for varicella and is more effective than pre-emptive therapy with antiviral drugs; however, the efficacy of post-exposure varicella vaccination for patients with HIV has not been studied and is not recommended. Antiviral Prophylaxis to Prevent Reactivation Disease (Herpes Zoster) Long-term administration of anti-VZV drugs to individuals with HIV to prevent episodes of herpes zoster is not routinely recommended (AII). However, in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in Africa that evaluated daily acyclovir prophylaxis (acyclovir 400 mg orally [PO] twice a day) administered to persons with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection who were not taking ART, acyclovir prophylaxis reduced the rate of herpes zoster by 62%. 38 Acyclovir did not prevent recurrent zoster episodes in patients with prior history of herpes zoster.38 Patients with HIV who are taking suppressive anti-herpes medications (i.e., acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) for other indications, such as prevention of genital herpes, may receive some additional benefit in reduction of risk of herpes zoster, but the relative risk reduction in persons who are receiving ART is unknown. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-4Vaccination to Prevent Reactivation Disease (Herpes Zoster) Two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines are currently available for the prevention of herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults. In 2017, a subunit vaccine containing recombinant VZV glycoprotein E (gE) adjuvant B (recombinant zoster vaccine, RZV , Shingrix) was FDA-approved and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to prevent herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults aged 50 years, given on a 2-dose schedule. 39 The approval and recommendation for the vaccine were based on pivotal Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving >30,000 participants in which the vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster in vaccinated participants was 97.2% overall and 91.3% in those aged 70 years. 40,41 The most common solicited adverse reactions in vaccine recipients were pain (78% of recipients), myalgia (45%), and fatigue (45%), with grade 3 injection site reactions (pain, redness, and swelling) reported in 9.4% of vaccine recipients and grade 3 solicited systemic events (myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms) reported by 10.8% of vaccine recipients. 39,42 Systemic grade 3 reactions were reported more frequently after Dose 2 than after Dose 1.42 There are limited data on use of RZV in persons with HIV , and to date ACIP has not recommended the use of RZV in persons with HIV . A Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled study enrolled 94 adults with HIV receiving ART with CD4 count 200 cells/ mm 3, 14 adults receiving ART with CD4 count <200 cells/ mm3, and 15 ART-naive adults with CD4 count 500 cells/mm3.43 The participants' median age was 46 years. Participants received the vaccine in three doses administered at 0, 2, and 6 months. The vaccine increased humoral and cell-mediated immunity to VZV gE, after two doses, including among persons with CD4 counts<200 cells/mm 3. The most common side effects included pain at the injection sites (98.6% of participants, 16.4% grade 3), fatigue (75.3%, 16.4% grade myalgia (74.0%, 13.7% grade 3) and headache (64.4%, 8.2% grade 3). No vaccine-related severe adverse events occurred during follow-up. Based on these very limited data in persons with HIV , the vaccine appears safe and immunogenic. There are no efficacy data available for the RZV among persons with HIV . Given that that risk of herpes zoster is high among persons with HIV , and the vaccine appears safe, experts recommend administration of RZV to persons with HIV aged 50 years following the FDA-approved schedule for persons without HIV (IM dose at 0 and 2 months) (AIII). There are no data regarding the optimal timing of vaccination for persons who have CD4 counts <200 cells/ mm 3 or who are not virologically suppressed on ART. Following initiation of ART, some experts would administer the RZV vaccination series after CD4 count recovery (CIII) , and others would administer the series after virologic suppression was achieved (CIII) . There are no efficacy data to guide RZV vaccination in persons with HIV aged <50 years given that There is limited clinical trial experience demonstrating safety in immunocompetent persons <50 years, and The duration of protection is not known. Thus, at this time, RZV is not recommended for persons aged <50 years with HIV infection. RZV is not a treatment for herpes zoster and should not be given during acute episodes (AIII) and should not be given to individuals with VZV-related inflammatory eye disease (keratitis or anterior uveitis) during episodes of active inflammation (AIII) . A live-zoster virus of herpes zoster is FDA-approved for use in immunocompetent adults aged 50 years. In Phase 3 clinical trials, the vaccine had 70% efficacy at preventing herpes zoster among adults aged 50 to 59 years, but efficacy declined with age, to 38% among those aged 70 years. 44,45 Given the higher efficacy for RZV , ACIP narrowly recommended RZV rather than ZVL in adults aged 50 years without HIV .39 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 2-dose regimen of ZVL (administered at Day 0 and Week 6) was conducted in 395 persons with HIV who were virologically suppressed on ART and had CD4 count 200 cells/mm 3.46 At 12 weeks post vaccination, VZV antibody titers and cell-mediated immunity increased among vaccine recipients. Injection site reactions were common (42% of vaccine recipients). No vaccine-strain herpes zoster cases were detected. Based on these data, ZVL appears to be safe and immunogenic in persons with HIV and CD4 count Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-5200 cells/mm3. An observational study followed 38 patients with HIV aged 50 years with CD4 count 350 cell/mm3 who received a single dose of ZVL and showed 2 patients (5%) had grade 3 or 4 adverse events; one patient with injection site pain, and one with grade 3 pruritis. Herpes zoster was diagnosed in one patient (3%) within 1 year after the vaccine was administered.47 Vaccine efficacy of ZVL in patients with HIV is not known. Given the higher efficacy of RZV among immunocompetent patients, experts prefer RZV over ZVL in persons with HIV aged 50 years (AIII) . However, if RZV is not available or cannot be given because of an allergy or intolerance, ZVL can be given to prevent herpes zoster in patients with HIV and CD4 count>200 cells/mm 3 (BIII). Importantly, ZVL vaccine persons with HIV with CD4 counts<200 cells/mm3 given concerns about the potential for disseminated ZVL vaccine strain infection (AIII) . Treating Disease Varicella No controlled prospective studies of antiviral therapy for varicella in adults with HIV have been reported. For uncomplicated varicella, the preferred treatment options are valacyclovir (1 g PO three times daily), or famciclovir (500 mg PO three times daily), initiated as early as possible after lesion onset and continued for 5 to 7 days (AII). Oral acyclovir (20 mg/kg body weight up to a maximum dose of 800 mg five times daily) is an alternative (BII). Intravenous (IV) acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days is the recommended initial treatment for patients with HIV with severe or complicated varicella (AIII) . 15,48,49 If no evidence of visceral involvement with VZV is apparent, many experts recommend switching from IV to oral antiviral therapy after the patient has defervesced (BIII). 50 Herpes Zoster Antiviral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible for all patients with HIV with herpes zoster diagnosed within 1 week of rash onset (or any time prior to full crusting of lesions). The recommended treatment options for acute localized dermatomal herpes zoster in patients with HIV are oral valacyclovir (AII), famciclovir (AII), or acyclovir (BII) (doses as above) for 7 to 10 days, although longer durations of therapy should be considered when lesions resolve slowly. Valacyclovir or famciclovir are preferred because of their improved pharmacokinetic properties and simplified dosing schedule. If cutaneous lesions are extensive or if visceral involvement is suspected, IV acyclovir should be initiated and continued until clinical improvement is evident (AII). 51 A switch from IV acyclovir to oral antiviral therapy (to complete a 10- to 14-day treatment course) is reasonable when formation of new cutaneous lesions has ceased, and the signs and symptoms of visceral VZV infection are improving (BIII). Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for herpes zoster in people with HIV is not recommended because there is no data supporting its benefit in this population (AIII). In patients with HZO, both stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis require treatment with topical corticosteroids; in many cases, chronic, low-dose topical corticosteroid therapy is necessary to maintain suppression of inflammation. Recurrences or exacerbations of inflammation are common. A role for antiviral agents in the management of chronic keratitis and uveitis has not been established. ARN should be treated promptly with antiviral therapy. One treatment recommended by some experts is high-dose IV acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days), followed by prolonged high-dose oral valacyclovir (1 g three times daily) (AIII) . High-dose oral antiviral treatment for 14 weeks has been shown to decrease the risk of second eye involvement among those who present with unilateral ARN syndrome; 52,53 (AIII) however, many ophthalmologists and infectious disease specialists will continue oral antiviral therapy for much longer. Many experts would also include one or two doses of intravitreal ganciclovir as part of the initial induction therapy (BIII). Use of oral valaciclovir instead of IV acyclovir for initial treatment has been reported. This approach should be used with caution, as serum drug levels with oral treatment will not be as high as those achieved with IV administration (CIII) . Involvement of an experienced ophthalmologist in management of patients with VZV ocular disease is strongly recommended (AIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-6Optimal antiviral therapy for PORN remains undefined and should be managed in consultation with an experienced ophthalmologist (AIII) .54-56 Outcomes with IV acyclovir or ganciclovir monotherapy were poor. Better results were obtained with IV ganciclovir (or the combination of ganciclovir plus foscarnet), along with intravitreal antiviral drug injections. 22,55,57 Specific treatment should include systemic therapy with at least one IV drug (either acyclovir or ganciclovir) (AIII) coupled with injections of at intravitreal drug (ganciclovir or foscarnet) (BIII).57,58 Intravitreal cidofovir should not be used because such injections may be associated with loss of intraocular pressure and other adverse effects. Ganciclovir ocular implants previously recommended by some experts are no longer manufactured. The prognosis for visual preservation in involved eyes is poor, despite aggressive antiviral therapy. When to Start Antiretroviral Therapy All persons with HIV should receive ART as soon as possible after diagnosis of HIV infection. The presence of disease caused by VZV is not an indication to defer or discontinue ART (AIII). Monitoring of Response to Therapy and Adverse Events (Including IRIS) For monitoring and adverse event recommendations related to anti-herpesvirus drugs, see preceding guideline sections on herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus . Initiation of ART appears to be associated with an increased frequency of VZV reactivation, peaking at about 3 months after ART initiation. 7,13,14,59,60 Observational studies have shown the risk of herpes zoster to increase two- to four-fold between 4 and 16 weeks after initiating ART. The clinical presentation and natural history of herpes zoster in the setting of immune reconstitution is similar to that observed in other patients with HIV , and episodes of herpes zoster in either setting should be managed in the same manner. Managing Treatment Failure Treatment failure caused by resistance of VZV to acyclovir and related drugs (e.g., famciclovir, ganciclovir) is rare, but should be suspected when clinical findings do not improve within 7 days of initiation of therapy or when skin lesions have an atypical (e.g., verrucous) appearance. A viral culture should be obtained, and if VZV is isolated, susceptibility testing performed to establish antiviral drug susceptibility and to document the need for alternative therapy. Among patients with suspected or proven acyclovir-resistant VZV infections, treatment with IV foscarnet is recommended (AII). 61 IV cidofovir is a potential alternative (CIII). Both foscarnet and cidofovir are nephrotoxic agents and should be given in consultation with an expert in infectious diseases. Special Considerations During Pregnancy Pregnant women with HIV who are susceptible to VZV and are in close contact with a person with active varicella or herpes zoster should receive VariZIG as soon as possible (within 10 days) 36 after exposure to VZV (AIII) . If oral acyclovir is used for post-exposure prophylaxis, VZV serology should be performed so that the drug can be discontinued if the patient is seropositive for VZV (CIII) . Pregnant women should not receive varicella vaccine (AIII) . For pregnant women without HIV with varicella, the risk of transmitting VZV to the infant resulting in congenital varicella syndrome is 0.4% when varicella infection occurs at or before 12 weeks' gestation, 2.2% with infection at 13 to 20 weeks, and negligible with infection after 20 weeks. 62 Women with varicella during the first half of pregnancy should be counseled about the risks to the fetus and offered detailed ultrasound surveillance for findings indicative of fetal congenital varicella syndrome. 62 Administration of VariZIG is recommended primarily to prevent complications in the mother; whether it has any benefit in prevention of congenital varicella syndrome is unknown. VariZIG should be administered to infants born to women who have varicella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery to reduce the severity and mortality of neonatal varicella acquired by exposure to maternal viremia (AIII) . Oral acyclovir or valacyclovir are the preferred treatments for pregnant women with HIV who have uncomplicated varicella during pregnancy (BIII). Pregnant women with HIV who have severe varicella or Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-7who exhibit signs or symptoms of VZV pneumonitis should be hospitalized and treated with IV acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) (AII). No controlled studies of antiviral therapy of herpes zoster during pregnancy have been reported. Recommended therapy for uncomplicated herpes zoster in pregnant women with HIV is oral acyclovir or valacyclovir (BIII). Pregnant women should not receive the herpes zoster vaccine (AIII) . Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Varicella-Zoster Virus Infections (page 1 of 2) Pre-Exposure Prevention of VZV Primary Infection Indications: Adults and adolescents with HIV who have CD4 counts 200 cells/mm3 and who do not have documentation of varicella vaccination, a history or diagnosis of varicella or herpes zoster confirmed by a health care provider, or laboratory confirmation of VZV disease; and anyone with HIV who is VZV seronegative should avoid exposure to (CIII). Vaccination: VZV -susceptible household contacts of VZV-susceptible persons with HIV should be vaccinated to prevent potential transmission of VZV to their contacts with HIV (BIII). In VZV -seronegative persons with CD4 counts 200 cells/mm3, primary varicella vaccination (Varivax), 2 doses (0.5 mL SQ) administered 3 months apart (CIII). If vaccination results in disease due to live-attenuated vaccine virus, treatment with acyclovir is recommended (AIII). If post-exposure V ariZIG has been administered, wait 5 months before varicella vaccination (CIII). If post-exposure acyclovir has been administered, wait 3 days before varicella vaccination (CIII). Administration of varicella vaccine to severely immunocompromised Primary Infection Indication (AIII): Close contact with a person who has active varicella or herpes zoster , and Susceptible to VZV (i.e., no histor y of varicella vaccination, no history of varicella or herpes zoster, or known to be VZV seronegative) Preferred Prophylaxis: V ariZIG 125 IU/10 kg (maximum of 625 IU) IM, administered as soon as possible and within 10 days after exposure to a person with active varicella or herpes zoster (AIII) If post-exposure VariZIG has wait 5 months before varicella vaccination (CIII). Note: Patients receiving monthly high dose IVIG (i.e., >400 mg/kg) are likely protected against VZV and probably do not require VariZIG if the last dose of IVIG they received was administered <3 weeks before VZV exposure. Alternative Prophylaxis (Begin 7-10 Days After Exposure): Acyclovir 800 mg PO 5 times a day for 5-7 days (BIII), or V alacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day for 5-7 days (BIII) Note: Neither these pre-emptive interventions nor post-exposure varicella vaccination have been studied in adults and adolescents with HIV. If acyclovir or valacyclovir is used, varicella vaccines should not be given <72 hours after the last dose of the antiviral drug. Preventing Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Vaccination: RZV (Shingrix) herpes zoster (AIII). RZV: Recommended in adults with HIV aged 50 years, regardless of CD4 count RZV 0.5 mL IM injection (2 dose series) at 0 and then at 2 to 6 months (AIII). RZV should not be given during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). Following initiation of AR T, some experts would delay RZV vaccination until patients are virologically suppressed on ART (CIII) or until CD4 count recovery (CIII) to maximize immunologic response to the vaccine. Attenuated ZVL: If RZV is not available or cannot be given because of allergy or intolerance, ZVL can be administered (0.65 mL SQ for 1 dose) (BIII). ZVL is contraindicated for persons with CD4 count<200 cells/mm3 (AIII). Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV BB-8Recommendations for Preventing and Treating Varicella Zoster Virus Infections (page 2 of 2) Treating Varicella Infections Primary Varicella Infection (Chickenpox) Uncomplicated Cases Preferred Therapy: V alacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII), or Famciclovir 500 mg PO three times a day (AII) Alternative Therapy: Acyclovir 800 mg PO 5 times daily (BII) Duration: 5-7 days Severe or Complicated Cases: Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV ever y 8 hours for 7-10 days (AIII) May switch to oral famciclovir , valacyclovir, or acyclovir after defervescence if Zoster (Shingles)Acute, Localized, DermatomalPreferred Therapy: V alacyclovir 1,000 mg PO three times a day (AII), or Famciclovir 500 mg PO three times a day (AII) Alternative Therapy: Acyclovir 800 mg PO 5 times a day (BII) Duration: 7-10 days; longer duration should be considered if lesions resolve slowly HZO : Late dendriform lesions of the corneal epithelium should be treated with systemic or topical anti-herpetic medications Extensive Cutaneous Lesion or Visceral Involvement: Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV ever y 8 hours until clinical improvement is evident (AII). Switch to oral therapy (valacyclovir 1 g three times a day , famciclovir 500 mg three times a day, or acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day to complete a 10-day to 14-day course) when formation of new lesions has ceased and signs and symptoms of visceral VZV infection are improving (BIII). ARN: Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV ever y 8 hours for 10-14 days, followed by valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day for 14 weeks (AIII) plus ganciclovir 2 mg/0.05 mL intravitreal twice weekly for 1-2 doses (BIII). Involvement of an experienced ophthalmologist is strongly recommended (AIII). Use of oral valaciclovir instead of IV acyclovir for initial treatment has been reported, but this approach should be used wit h caution, as serum drug levels with oral treatment will not be as high as those achieved with IV administration (CIII). PORN: Involvement of an experienced ophthalmologist is strongly recommended (AIII). Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV ever y 8 hours or ganciclovir 5 mg/kg every 12 hours plus ganciclovir 2 mg/0.05 mL and/or foscarnet 1.2 mg/0.05 mL intravitreal twice weekly (AIII) Optimize AR T regimen (AIII) Duration of therapy is not well defined and should be determined based on clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses in consultation with an ophthalmologist.

In patients with CD4 counts 350 cells/\u00b5L, vaccination should not be deferred until CD4 count reaches >350 cells/\u00b5L, because some patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/\u00b5L do respond to vaccination (AII). HBV IM (Engerix-B 20 \u00b5g/mL or Recombivax HB 10 \u00b5g/mL), 0, 1, and 6 months (AII) , or HBV vaccine IM (Engerix-B 40 \u00b5g/mL or Recombivax HB 20 \u00b5g/mL), 0, 1, 2 and 6 months (BI), V accine conjugated to CpG (Heplisav-B\u00ae) IM at 0 and 1 months (CIII) - a 2-dose series can only be used when both doses given are Heplisav-B \u00ae.

Patients with anti-HBs <10 international units/mL at 1 month are considered non-responders (BIII). For patients with isolated anti-HBc One standard dose of HBV vaccine followed by anti-HBs at 1-2 months. If the titer is >100 IU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if it is <100 IU/mL, a complete series of HBV vaccine should be completed followed by anti-HBs testing (BII).Some experts recommend vaccinating with 40-\u00b5g (CIII). Vaccine Non-Responders: Anti-HBs <10 international units/ mL 1 month after vaccination series For patients with low CD4 counts at time of first vaccine series, some experts might delay revaccination until after a sustained increase in CD4 count with AR T (CIII).Re-vaccinate with a second vaccine series (BIII) HBV vaccine IM (Engerix-B 40 \u00b5g/mL or Recombivax HB 20 \u00b5g/mL), 0, 1, 2 and 6 months (BI).

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV CC-8Table 2. Treatment of AIDS-Associated Opportunistic Infections (Includes Recommendations for Acute Treatment and Secondary Prophylaxis/Chronic Suppressive/Maintenance Therapy) (page 1 of 23) (Last updated May 26, 2020; last reviewed May 26, 2020) Opportunistic Infection Preferred Therapy Alternative Therapy Other Comments Bacterial Enteric InfectionsEmpiric therapy pending definitive diagnosisDiagnostic fecal specimens should be obtained before initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy. If culture is positive, antibiotic susceptibilities should be performed to inform antibiotic choices given increased reports of antibiotic resistance. If a culture independent diagnostic test is positive, reflex cultures for antibiotic susceptibilities should also be done. Empiric antibiotic therapy is indicated for advanced HIV patients (CD4 count <200 cells/\u00b5L or concomitant AIDS-defining illnesses), with clinically severe diarrhea (6 stools/day or bloody stool) and/or accompanying fever or chills. Empiric Therapy: Ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) q12h (AIII) Therapy should be adjusted based on the results of diagnostic work-up. For patients with chronic diarrhea (>14 days) without severe clinical signs, empiric antibiotics therapy is not necessary, can withhold treatment until a diagnosis is made .Empiric Therapy: Ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h (BIII), g IV q8h (BIII)Oral or IV rehydration (if indicated) should be given to patients with diarrhea (AIII). Antimotility agents should be avoided if there is concern about inflammatory diarrhea, including Clostridium-difficile-associated diarrhea (BIII). If no clinical response after 3-4 days, consider follow-up stool culture with antibiotic susceptibility testing or alternative diagnostic tests (e.g., toxin assays, molecular testing) to evaluate alternative diagnosis, antibiotic resistance, or drug-drug interactions. IV antibiotics and hospitalization should be considered in patients with marked nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, and blood pressure instability. Campylo-bacteriosis For Mild Disease and If CD4 Count >200 cells/ \u00b5 L: No therapy unless symptoms persist for more than several days (CIII) For Mild-to-Moderate Disease Disease (If Susceptible): Ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) q12h (BIII), or Azithromycin 500 mg PO daily (BIII) bacteremia (AIII)) For Campylobacter 500-750 mg aminoglycoside (BIII) Duration (PO or IV) q24h (BIII), or Moxifloxacin 400 mg (PO or IV) q24h Add an aminoglycoside to fluoroquinolone in or IV rehydration if indicated (AIII). Antimotility agents should be avoided (BIII). If no clinical response after 5-7 days, consider follow-up stool culture, alternative diagnosis, or antibiotic resistance. There is an increasing rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in the United States (24% resistance in 2011). The rationale of addition of an aminoglycoside to a fluoroquinolone in bacteremic patients is to prevent emergence of quinolone resistance. Effective ART may reduce the frequency, severity, and recurrence of campylobacter infections.

Fecal microbiota therapy may be successful and safe to treat recurrent CDI in HIV-infected patients (CIII). See text and references for additional information. Salmon-ellosisAll HIV-infected patients with salmonellosis should receive antimicrobial treatment due to an increase of bacteremia (by 20-100 fold) and mortality (by up to 7-fold) compared to HIV-negative individuals (AIII).Oral or IV rehydration if indicated (AIII). Antimotility agents should be avoided (BIII). The role of long-term secondary prophylaxis in patients with recurrent Salmonella bacteremia is not well established. Must weigh benefit against risks of long-term antibiotic exposure (BIII). Effective ART may reduce the frequency, severity, and recurrence of salmonella infections.

Avoid fluoroquinolones if ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 ug/ml even if the laboratory identifies the isolate as sensitive. Many Shigella strains resistant to fluoroquinolones exhibit resistance to other commonly used antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic sensitivity testing of Shigella isolates from HIV-infected individuals should be performed routinely.

Given increasing antimicrobial resistance and limited data showing that antibiotic therapy limits transmission, antibiotic treatment may be withheld in patients with CD4 >500 cells/mm 3 whose diarrhea resolves prior to culture confirmation of Shigella infection (CIII). Oral or IV rehydration if indicated (AIII). Antimotility agents should be avoided (BIII). If no clinical response after 5-7 days, consider follow-up stool culture, alternative diagnosis, or antibiotic resistance.

Treatment of AIDS-Associated Opportunistic Infections (Includes Recommendations for Acute Treatment and Secondary Prophylaxis/Chronic Suppressive/Maintenance Therapy) (page 5 of 23) Opportunistic Infection Preferred Therapy Alternative Therapy Other Comments Chagas Disease For Acute, Early Chronic, and Re- Activated Disease: Benznidazole 5-8 mg/kg/day PO in 2 divided doses for 30-60 days (BIII) (not commercially available in the United States; contact the CDC Drug Service at drugservice@cdc.gov or (404) 639-3670, or the CDC emergency operations center at (770) 488-7100)For Acute, Early Chronic, and Reactivated Disease Nifurtimox 8-10 mg/kg/day PO for 90-120 days (CIII) (not commercially available in the U.S., contact the CDC Drug Service at drugservice@cdc.gov or (404) 639-3670, or the CDC emergency operations center at (770) 488-7100)Treatment is effective in reducing parasitemia and preventing clinical symptoms or slowing disease progression. It is ineffective in achieving parasitological cure. Duration of therapy has not been studied in HIV-infected patients. Initiate or optimize ART in patients undergoing treatment for Chagas disease, once they are clinically stable (AIII). Coccidioidomycosis Clinically Mild Infections (e.g., Focal Pneumonia): Fluconazole 400 mg* PO daily (AII), or Itraconazole 200 mg* PO BID (BII) Bone or Joint Infections: Itraconazole 200 mg* PO BID (AI) Severe, Non-Meningeal Infection (Diffuse Pulmonary Infection or Severely Ill Patients with Extrathoracic, Disseminated Disease): Lipid formulation amphotericin B Amphotericin 0.7-1.0 mg/kg IV daily (AII) Duration of therapy: continue until clinical improvement, then switch to a triazole (BIII) Meningeal Infections: Fluconazole 400-800 mg* IV or PO daily (AII)Mild Infections (Focal Pneumonia) For Patients Who Failed to Respond to Fluconazole or Itraconazole: Posaconazole 300 mg delayed- release tablet* PO BID x 1 day , then once daily (BIII), or Posaconazole 400 mg oral suspension* PO BID (BII), or V oriconazole 200 mg* PO BID (BIII) Bone or Joint Infection: Fluconazole 400 mg* PO daily (BI) Severe, Non-Meningeal Infection (Diffuse Pulmonar y Infection or Severely Ill Patients with Extrathoracic, Disseminated Disease): Some specialists will add a triazole (fluconazole* or itraconazole*) 400 mg per day to amphotericin B therapy and continue triazole once amphotericin B is stopped (BIII). Meningeal Infections: Itraconazole 200 mg* PO TID for 3 days, then 200 mg PO BID (BII) , or V oriconazole 200-400 mg* PO BID (BIII), or Posaconazole 300 mg delayed-release tablet* PO BID x 1 day , then once daily (CIII), or Posaconazole 400 mg oral suspension* PO can occur in 25%-33% of HIV-negative patients with diffuse pulmonary or disseminated diseases. Therapy should be given for at least 12 months and usually much longer; discontinuation is dependent on clinical and serological response and should be made in consultation with experts (BIII). Therapy should be lifelong in patients with meningeal infections because relapse occurs in 80% of HIV-infected patients after discontinuation of triazole therapy (AII). *Fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole may have significant interactions with other medications including ARV drugs. These interactions are complex and can be bi-directional. Refer to Table 5 or Antiretroviral guidelines for dosage recommendations. Therapeutic drug monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary to ensure triazole antifungal and antiretroviral efficacy and reduce concentration-related toxicities. Intrathecal amphotericin B should only be given in consultation with a specialist and administered by an individual with experience with the technique. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV CC-13Table 2. Treatment of AIDS-Associated Opportunistic Infections (Includes Recommendations for Acute Treatment and Secondary Prophylaxis/Chronic Suppressive/Maintenance Therapy) (page 6 of 23) Opportunistic Infection Preferred Therapy Alternative Therapy Other Comments Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients presenting with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia. The recommendations listed are suggested empiric therapy. The regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII). Providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections (e.g., PCP , TB), which may alter the empiric therapy. Empiric Therapy: A PO beta-lactam plus Levofloxacin 750 mg PO once daily (AII), or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (AII), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. Empiric Therapy for Hospitalized Patients with Non-Severe CAP: An IV beta-lactam plus cefotaxime, 750 mg IV once daily (AI) , or moxifloxacin, 400 mg IV once daily (AI), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. Empiric Therapy for Hospitalized Patients with Severe CAP: An IV beta-lactam plus IV azithromycin (AI), or An IV beta-lactam plus (levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily) (AI) Preferred Beta-Lactams: Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactamEmpiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients presenting with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia. The recommendations listed are suggested empiric therapy. The regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII). Providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections (e.g., PCP , TB), which may alter the empiric therapy. Therapy for Hospitalized Patients with CAP : An IV beta-lactam plus doxycycline (CIII) Empiric Therapy for Hospitalized Patients with Severe CAP For Penicillin-Allergic Patients: Aztreonam IV plus (levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily) (BIII) Empiric Therapy for Patients at Risk of Pseudomonas Pneumonia: An IV antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an azithromycin IV antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside plus (levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily) (BIII) For Penicillin-Allergic Patients: Replace the beta-lactam with aztreonam (BIII).Duration: For most patients, 5-7 days. Patients should be afebrile for 48-72 hours and clinically stable before stopping antibiotics. Longer duration is often required if severe CAP or bacteremia is present, and particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus pneumonia. Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but is not being treated. Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended, because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII). Patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have bacterial resistance to macrolide due to chronic exposure For patients begun on IV antibiotic therapy, switching to PO should be considered when they are clinically improved and able to tolerate oral medications. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for developing drug resistance and drug toxicities (AI).

Patients receiving flucytosine should have either blood levels monitored (peak level 2 hours after dose should be 30-80 mcg/mL) or close monitoring of blood counts for development of cytopenia. Dosage should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency (BII). Opening pressure should always be measured when an LP is performed (AII). Repeated LPs or CSF shunting are essential to effectively manage increased intracranial pressure (BIII). Corticosteroids and mannitol are ineffective in reducing ICP and are NOT recommended (BII).

(Note: This regimen should be avoided in patients with sulfa allergy because of cross hypersensitivity with probenecid.)The choice of therapy for CMV retinitis should be individualized, based on location and severity of the lesions, level of immunosuppression, and other factors (e.g., concomitant medications and ability to adhere to treatment) (AIII). Given the evident benefits of systemic therapy in preventing contralateral eye involvement, reduce CMV visceral disease and improve survival. Whenever feasible, treatment should include systemic therapy. The ganciclovir ocular implant, which is effective for treatment of CMV retinitis is no longer available. For sight threatening retinitis, intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet can be given to achieve higher ocular concentration faster.

Well-Documented, Histologically Confirmed CMV Pneumonia: Experience for treating CMV pneumonitis in HIV patients is limited. Use of IV ganciclovir or IV foscarnet is reasonable (doses same as for CMV retinitis) (CIII). The optimal duration of therapy and the role of oral valganciclovir have not been established. CMV Neurological Disease Note: T reatment should be initiated promptly. Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12h + (foscarnet 90 mg/kg IV q12h or 60 mg/kg IV q8h) to stabilize disease and maximize response, continue until symptomatic improvement and resolution of neurologic symptoms (CIII) The optimal duration of therapy and the role of oral valganciclovir have not been established. Optimize AR T to achieve viral suppression and immune reconstitution (BIII).Chronic Maintenance (for 3-6 months until ART induced immune recovery (see Table 4): Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV 5-7 times weekly (AI), or Foscarnet 90-120 mg/kg IV once daily (AI), or Cidofovir 5 mg/kg IV ever y other week with saline hydration and probenecid as above IV patients with treatment-limiting toxicities to ganciclovir or with ganciclovir resistance, or V alganciclovir 900 mg PO q12h in milder disease and if able to tolerate PO therapy (BII), or Duration: 21-42 days or until symptoms have resolved (CII) For mild disease, if ART can be initiated without delay, consider withholding CMV therapy (CIII).Routine (i.e., every 3 months) ophthalmologic follow-up is recommended after stopping chronic maintenance therapy for early detection of relapse or IRU, and then periodically after sustained immune reconstitution (AIII). IRU may develop in the setting of immune reconstitution. Treatment of IRU Periocular corticosteroid or short courses of systemic steroid (BIII). Initial therapy in patients with CMV retinitis, esophagitis, colitis, and pneumonitis should include initiation or optimization of ART (BIII).

Cross-resistance to emtricitabine or telbivudine should be assumed in patients with suspected or proven lamivudine-resistance. When changing ART regimens, continue agents with anti-HBV activity (BIII). If anti-HBV therapy is discontinued and a flare occurs, therapy should be re-instituted because it can be potentially life-saving (AIII). As HBV reactivation can occur during treatment for HCV with directly active agents (DAAs) in the absence of HBV-active drugs, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection who will be treated for HCV should be on HBV-active ART at the time of HCV treatment initiation (AIII). Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Disease The field of HCV drug development is evolving rapidly. The armamenarium of approved drugs is likely to expand considerably in the next few years. Clinicians should refer to the most recent HCV treatment guidelines (http://www.hcvguidelines.org) for the most updated recommendations.

These interactions are complex and can be bi-directional. Refer to Drug-Drug Interactions in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for dosage recommendations. Therapeutic drug monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary to ensure triazole antifungal and ARV efficacy and reduce concentration-related toxicities. Random serum concentration of itraconazole between 1-2 mcg/mL is recommended. Frequency and severity of toxicities increase when concentration is >4 mcg/mL. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts >300 cells/mm 3 should be managed as non-immunocompromised host (AIII).

Topical cidofovir has activity against genital warts, but the product is not commercially available (CIII). Intralesional interferon-alpha is usually not recommended because of high cost, difficult administration, and potential for systemic side effects (CIII). The rate of recurrence of genital warts is high despite treatment in HIV-infected patients. There is no consensus on the treatment of oral warts. Many treatments for anogenital warts cannot be used in the oral mucosa. Surgery is the most common treatment for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.Patient-Applied Therapy for Uncomplicated External Warts That Can Be Easily Identified by Patients: Podophyllotoxin (e.g., podofilox 0.5% solution or 0.5% gel): Apply to all lesions BID for 3 consecutive days, followed by 4 days of no therapy , repeat weekly for up to 4 cycles, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII), or Imiquimod 5% cream: Apply to lesion at bedtime and remove in the morning on 3 non-consecutive nights weekly for up to 16 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible. Each treatment should be washed with soap and water 6-10 hours after application (BII), or Sinecatechins 15% ointment: Apply to affected areas TID for up to 16 weeks, until warts are completely cleared and not visible (BIII).Provider-Applied Therapy for Complex or Multicentric Lesions, or Lesions Inaccessible to Patient Applied Therapy: Cr yotherapy (liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe): Apply until each lesion is thoroughly frozen. Repeat every 1-2 weeks for up to 4 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Some providers allow the lesion to thaw, then freeze a second time in each session (BIII), or T richloroacetic acid or bichloroacetic acid cauterization: 80%-90% aqueous solution, apply to wart only, allow to dry until a white frost develops. Repeat weekly for up to 6 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII), or Surgical excision (BIII) or laser surgery (CIII) to external or anal warts, or Podophyllin resin 10%-25% in tincture of benzoin: Apply to all lesions (up to 10 cm 2), then wash off a few hours later, repeat weekly for up to 6 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (CIII).

Whenever possible, patients should be tested for G6PD before use of dapsone or primaquine. Alternative therapy should be used in patients found to have G6PD deficiency. Patients who are receiving pyrimethamine a/sulfadiazine for treatment or suppression of toxoplasmosis do not require additional PCP prophylaxis (AII). If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, re-institution should be considered after the reaction resolves (AII). The dose can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI), reduced, or the frequency modified (CIII).

The main treatment approach is to reverse the immunosuppression caused by HIV. Initiate ART immediately in ART-naive patients (AII). Optimize ART in patients who develop PML in phase of HIV viremia on ART (AIII)None. Corticosteroids may be used for PML-IRIS characterized by contrast enhancement, edema or mass effect, and with clinical deterioration (BIII) (see text for further discussion). Syphilis Early Stage (Primary, Secondary, and Early-Latent Syphilis): Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for 1 dose (AII) Late-Latent Disease (>1 year or of Unknown Duration, and No Signs of Neurosyphilis): Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 doses (AII) Late-Stage (Tertiary-Cardiovascular or Gummatous Disease): Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 doses (AII) (Note: rule out neurosyphilis before initiation of benzathine penicillin, and obtain infectious diseases consultation to guide management) Neurosyphilis (Including Otic or Ocular Disease): Aqueous cr ystalline penicillin G 18-24 million units per day (administered as 3-4 million units IV q4h or by continuous IV infusion) for 10-14 days (AII) +/- benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 doses after completion of IV therapy (CIII)Early Stage (Primary, Secondary, and Early-Latent Syphilis): For penicillin-allergic patients Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 14 days (BII), or Ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV daily for 10-14 days (BII), or Azithromycin 2 g PO for 1 dose (BII) (Note: azithromycin is not recommended for men who have sex with men or pregnant women (AII)) Late-Latent Disease (>1 year or of Unknown Duration, and No Signs of Neurosyphilis): For penicillin-allergic patients Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 28 days (BIII) Neurosyphilis: Procaine penicillin 2.4 million units IM daily plus probenecid 500 mg PO QID for 10-14 days (BII) +/- benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 doses after completion of above (CIII), or For penicillin-allergic patients: Desensitization to penicillin is the preferred approach (BIII); if not feasible, ceftriaxone, 2 g IV daily for 10-14 days (BII)The efficacy of non-penicillin alternatives has not been evaluated in HIV-infected patients and they should be used only with close clinical and serologic monitoring. Combination of procaine penicillin and probenecid is not recommended for patients who are allergic to sulfa-containing medications (AIII). The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction accompanied by headache and myalgia that can occur within the first 24 hours after therapy for syphilis. This reaction occurs most frequently in patients with early syphilis, high non-treponemal titers, and prior penicillin treatment.

Chronic maintenance therapy with voriconazole has not been studied.Itraconazole is not recommended as induction therapy for talaromycosis (AI). ART can be initiated as early as 1 week after initiation of treatment for talaromycosis (BIII). Itraconazole and voriconazole may have significant interactions with certain ARV agents. These interactions are complex and can be bi-directional. Refer to Drug-Drug Interactions in the Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines for dosage recommendations. TDM and dosage adjustment may be necessary to ensure triazole antifungal and ARV efficacy and reduce concentration-related toxicities. The goals of itraconazole and voriconazole trough concentrations are >0.5 mcg/mL and >1.0 mcg/mL respectively.

For patients with a history of sulfa allergy, sulfa desensitization should be attempted using one of several published strategies (BI). Atovaquone should be administered until therapeutic doses of TMP-SMX are achieved (CIII). Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) should only be administered when clinically indicated to treat mass effect associated with focal lesions or associated edema (BIII); discontinue as soon as clinically feasible. Anticonvulsants should be administered to patients with a history of seizures (AIII) and continued through acute treatment, but should not be used as seizure prophylaxis (AIII). If clindamycin is used in place of sulfadiazine, additional therapy must be added to prevent PCP (AII).

Duration of therapy for VZV retinitis is not well defined, and should be determined based on clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses and ophthalmologic responses. Optimization of ART is recommended for serious and difficult-to-treat VZV infections (e.g., retinitis, encephalitis) keratitis and anterior uveitis, topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation may be necessary.

Significant Pharmacokinetic Interactions between Drugs Used to Treat or Prevent Opportunistic Infections (page 1 of 15) (Last updated October 22, 2019; last reviewed October 22, 2019) This table lists the known, predicted, or suspected PK interactions between drugs used for the treatment or prevention of HIV-associated OIs. Many of the drugs listed in this table may also interact with ARV drugs. Clinicians should see the Drug-Drug Interactions tables in the most current Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines to assess interaction potentials between OI drugs and ARV drugs. Throughout the table, three recommendations are commonly used when concomitant administration of two drugs may lead to untoward consequences. The rationale for these recommendations are summarized below: Do not coadminister. There is either strong evidence or strong likelihood that the drug-drug interaction cannot be managed with a dose modification of one or both drugs, and will or may result in either: Increase in concentrations of one or both drugs, which may lead to excessive risk of toxicity; or Decrease in concentrations of one or both drugs, which may render one or both drugs ineffective. Coadministration should be avoided, if possible. There is a potential for significant PK interactions. If other more favorable options exist, clinicians are advised to consider changing components of the regimen to accommodate a safer or more effective regimen. However, coadministration of the drugs may be necessary when there are no other acceptable therapeutic options that provide a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio. Use with caution.Drug combinations are recommended to be used with caution when: PK studies have shown a moderate degree of interaction of unknown clinical significance; or Based on the known metabolic pathway of the two drugs, there is a potential for PK interaction of unknown clinical significance. Rifamycin Antibiotics-Related Interactions Rifamycin antibiotics are potent inducers of Phase 1 and Phase 2 drug metabolizing reactions. Studies have demonstrated that with daily doses of rifampin, enzyme induction increases over a week or more. Based on limited data, lar ger doses of rifampin (e.g., 1,200 mg) appear to produce the same maximum induction as lower doses, but more rapidly. Single doses of rifampin may not produce significant induction. In general, rifabutin as a CYP3A4 inducer is about 40% of the potency of rifampin, but this can vary by substrate and enzymatic reaction. In general, daily rifapentine (for active TB disease) is at least as potent an inducer as rifampin. However, the potential of drug interactions with once weekly rifapentine (prescribed with isoniazid for latent TB infection) is not well studied, and may result in reduced exposure of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates. When using a rifamycin antibiotic with a potential interacting drug is necessary, close monitoring for clinical efficacy of the coadministered agent is advised. Note: To avoid redundancy, drug-drug interactions are listed only once by primary drug (listed alphabetically). Subsequently, when an interacting agent becomes the primary drug, guideline users are referred to the entry for the initial primary drug. See the Clarithromycin row for the first example of this format. Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV CC-35Table 5.

Significant Pharmacokinetic Interactions between Drugs Used to Treat or Prevent Opportunistic Infections (page 15 of 15) a Rifamycin antibiotics are potent inducers of Phase 1 and Phase 2 drug-metabolizing reactions. Studies have demonstrated that with daily doses of rifampin, enzyme induction increases over a week or more. Based on limited data, larger doses of rifampin (e.g., 1,200 mg) appear to produce the same maximum induction as lower doses, but more rapidly. Single doses of rifampin may not produce significant induction. In general, rifabutin is about 40% as potent a CYP3A4 inducer as rifampin, but this can vary by substrate and enzymatic reaction. In general, daily rifapentine (for active TB disease) is at least as potent an inducer as rifampin. However, the potential of drug interactions with once weekly rifapentine (for latent TB infection, along with isoniazid) is not well studied, and may result in reduced exposure of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates. When a rifamycin antibiotic is given with a potential interacting drug, close monitoring for clinical efficacy of the coadministered agent is advised.

This section will have guidance that is similar to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) which is the accepted standard in the United States but is likely to make recommendations additionally in areas where ACIP is silent. (These immunization schedules are available at www.cdc. gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html . Detailed information on these and other vaccines can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/ index.html ). Readers should consult individual pathogen chapters for additional guidance beyond the ACIP recommendations presented here.
