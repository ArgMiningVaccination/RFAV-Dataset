Your body begins to make antibodies that protect you against the disease before you have contact with it. This is the process of becoming immunized or building immunity. Without a vaccine, your body likely does not have the antibodies to fight many of the diseases that vaccines can prevent. This means you and your family could get very sick. Getting immunized lets you build immunity against disease, before being exposed to it. Immunization helps your body fight the disease faster and can prevent you from getting the disease. It also helps to prevent diseases from spreading to others. Over the past 50 years, immunization has saved more lives in Canada than any other treatment, procedure, or policy against disease. Polio can lead to paralysis (not being able to move all or part of your body) and death. Before immunization, polio infected more than 5,000 Canadians every year. Thanks to the polio vaccine, between 2016 and 2020, there were 0 cases reported. In children under 5 years and adults older than 40 years, 2 to 4 out of 10 people who get diphtheria can die. Before immunization, diphtheria infected more than 9,000 Canadians every year. Thanks to the diphtheria vaccine, between 2016 and 2020, the highest number of cases reported in any year was 10. 1 in 1,000 people with measles will get encephalitis (swelling of the brain), which can lead to seizures, deafness, or brain damage. Before immunization, measles infected more than 60,000 Canadians every year. Thanks to the measles vaccine, between 2016 and 2020, the most cases reported in any year was about 100. If you get rubella while you're pregnant, it can cause loss of a baby during pregnancy or the baby may be born with disabilities. Before immunization, rubella infected more than 37,000 Canadians every year. Thanks to the rubella vaccine, between 2016 and 2020, the highest number of cases reported in any year was 1. Hib can cause meningitis and lead to lifelong disabilities and death. Before immunization, invasive Hib infected more than 600 Canadians every year, and it was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children. Thanks to the Hib vaccine, between 2016 and 2020, the most cases of invasive Hib reported in a year was less than 20. In Canada 1 to 4 deaths are related to pertussis each year, most often in babies. Before immunization, pertussis infected almost 20,000 Canadians every year. Thanks to the pertussis vaccine, between 2016 and 2020, the most cases reported in any year was less than 4,000. When you and your family get immunized with a vaccine, you're protecting yourselves and helping to build your community's defence against diseases. The more people in a community who are immunized, the less a disease can spread. For immunization to protect your community from certain diseases, most people in your community need to be immunized. This is often called \"herd immunity.\" Herd immunity is important to protect people who are at high risk of getting very sick\u2014including young babies, older adults, people having cancer treatment or who have had an organ transplant\u2014who cannot get a vaccine. They rely on those around them to get immunized to help protect them from disease. By getting immunized, you're helping to protect your vulnerable neighbours and your community. Vaccine safety is a top priority. Canada uses extremely safe vaccines. Here is information about Canada's vaccine safety system: Immunization is very safe. It's much safer to get the vaccine than to get the diseases that vaccines can prevent. Vaccines contain ingredients to help prevent disease. They also contain small amounts of other ingredients to help keep vaccines safe and effective. These may be added to a vaccine to help you have a stronger natural immune response to a vaccine. Aluminum is found in air, food, and water. The amount of aluminum in a vaccine is similar to the amount of aluminum in breastmilk and infant formula. This is used in the manufacturing process of some vaccines to make viruses and toxins harmless. The formaldehyde is then removed, leaving only very small amounts that are safe. Formaldehyde is produced naturally in the human body. A baby's body naturally has about 10 times more formaldehyde than there is in 1 dose of a vaccine. Only some influenza (flu) vaccines contain thimerosal, a preservative used to stop any germs from making the vaccine unsafe. Routine childhood immunizations (in Canada) do not contain thimerosal. Learn more about thimerosal in vaccines. Methylmercury is not in vaccines. Thimerosal contains a very small amount of a form of mercury, called ethylmercury. Ethylmercury leaves your body quickly through your stool (poop). It does not build up in your body like methylmercury. Human cell lines may be used in the early development of some vaccines, but all cells are removed during the purification of the vaccine. Similarly, human cell lines are used to test and develop many common medicines, including antacids and cold medicines. Vaccines contain additional ingredients to help keep the vaccines safe and effective. It is much safer to get a vaccine than to get the diseases that vaccines can prevent. The benefits of vaccines are much greater than the risk of developing an allergy. "}
