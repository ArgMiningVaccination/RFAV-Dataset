In addition, most drugs enter the fet al-placental unit, which pose several challenges to medical care, as it affects both the unborn child as well as t he expectant mother. This also ap plies to the treatment of non -psychotic mental disorders (NMDs) such as depression, restlessness, sleep disorders, and anxiety since the use of synthetic, central nervous system (CNS) -active drugs for treatment should be carefully considered in a risk -benefit ratio. Nevertheless, pregnancy is a vulnerable period for such disorders and preexisting mental illnesses may even worsen or relapse. Alternatively, there are some herbal medicines , so called phytopharmaceuticals, which possess antidepressant, sedative , or anxiolytic properties. St. John's wort, for example, is used to treat mild to moderate depression, whereas California poppy, valerian, and hops are mainly known for their sleep -inducing effects. Finally, lavender essential oil represents an option for the treatment of restlessness and anxiety due to its calming, sedative, and anxiolytic effects. Most products based on these phytopharmaceuticals are available over the counter (OTC) and are generally recommended by a considerable proportion of health car e professionals who deal with pregnant women , such as midwives and obstetricians. Despite the limited experimental and clinical evidence, and especially lack of safety data, pregnant women often resort to herbal medicines and perceive them as safe. We des igned a cross -sectional survey with which we determined the use of most common herbal medicines in pregnancy by obstetrics patients. Further more , some questions targeted the perceived effectiveness and tolerability of some of these plants. The survey revealed that a large majority of pregnant women make use of herbal medicines, and lavender (22%), valerian (4.7%), St. John's wort (3.0%), and hops (1.7%) were among the most mentioned pharmaceutical h erbal products for the treatment of mental disorders and/or symptoms (MDS ). Although 52.0% of all participants suffered from MDS during pregnancy, only 1.3% reported taking (synthetic) psychoactive medications. The fact that the prevalence of MDS was highe r in pharmaceutical herbal products users than in non -users suggests that pregnant women rely on herbal medicines to treat mild MDS. St. John's wort, valerian, hops, and lavender were used to reduce mood and sleep disorders, restlessness, and stress with p erceived good to very good effectiveness and tolerability; no participant reported the use of California poppy. II To verify whether various herbal extracts such as St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, hops, and lavender can be used for the treatment of NMD in pregnancy, their safety must be thoroughly investigated with a palette of in vitro assays. Those extracts and some of their active marker compounds were therefore evaluated for their cytotoxic and genotoxic potential and for their effects on met abolism and cell differentiation. The in -depth in vitro safety assessment indicates that extracts of St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, hops, and lavender - at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL - have no cytotoxic or genotoxic potential and do not compromise the viability, metabolic activity, and differentiation of placental cells. Moreover, none of the five extracts was able to significantly alter protein expression of BeWo b30 cells . For active marker substances, protopine (found in California poppy), valerenic acid (in valerian), and linalool (in lavender) showed no adverse effects in all experiments performed. The following phytochemicals might conceivably cause safety issues: hyperforin (in St . John's wort) 1 \u00b5M). Hypericin (in St. John's wort) decreased cell viability ( 1 \u00b5M) and induced cell apoptosis (30 \u00b5M). Valtrate (in valerian) cell \u00b5M), cell apoptosis ( 10 \u00b5M), and decreased the metabolic cell activity by reducing glucose consumption and concomitant lactate production. However, none of the tested phytochemicals resulted in genotoxic effects and thus are not DNA damaging. In summary, most of the phytochemicals were not of concern, but the attainment of high plasma concentrations of a few relevant phytochemicals - hyperforin, hypericin, and valtrate - deserves special attention. In addition to investigating effects on placenta l cells, the question of transplacental permeation of certain phytochemicals needs to be addressed in order to better assess the risk of fetal exposure. For this purpose, an ex vivo placental perfusion model was optimized and modified that it can be used f or the application of phytochemicals. Furthermore, an in vitro Transwell model with placental cells was established which served to complement the placental perfusion model. We successfully used the human ex vivo placental perfusion model for the first time for transport experiments with phytochemicals, after a thorough validation with various compounds, such as antipyrine, citalopram, and diazepam. Only a small fraction of the initially present hyperforin (< 10% ) reached the fetal circuit after 4 h, whereas hypericin did not cross the placental barrier and therefore remained in the maternal circuit. In contrast, p rotopine was transferred from the maternal to the fetal circuit, reaching a steady state after 90 min with no further changes in concentration. Also, valerenic acid was transferred gradually over a 4 -hour period and reached an equilibrium with the maternal concentration. None of the phytochemicals affected placental viability or functionality, and histopa thological evaluation of all placental specimens revealed no pathologic findings. In addition, III in vitro translocation studies have confirmed that valerenic acid , from valerian, cannot cross the placental cell layer within 60 min, which might indicate that this phytochemical is not accessible to the unborn child in early pregnancy. We were able to gain more detailed knowledge into the safety of St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, hops, and lavender extracts and a few of their active phytochemicals through in -depth in vitro assessments and an ex vivo model. In addition, we know that phytomedicines of these extracts , except California poopy, are already used in pregnancy in Switzerland with well -perceived effectiveness and tolerability. We hope that this thesis contributes to a rational basis for futur e decisions on the treatment of NMDs during pregnancy.

This is also true for the treatment of non -psychotic mental disorders su ch as depression, restlessness, sleep disorders, and anxiety , which is why various phytomedicines are available as potential alternatives. These show good clinical efficacy, however safety data on reproductive toxicology are only partially available or eve n completely lacking. It is becoming increasingly evident that a better understanding of the safety of herbal medicines in pregnancy is urgently needed. The main objective of this thesis was therefore t o assess the safety of various herbal extracts and phy tochemicals by studying their effects on placental function in vitro and ex vivo , and to investigate on the transplacental transfer of phytochemicals to evaluate the fetal exposure. The specific aims of this thesis were: (i) to reveal the most commonly used herbal medicines in pregnancy, in the presence of MDS, and to evaluate some of their perceived effectiveness and tolerability with a cross -sectional survey of obstetrics patients (Chapter 1) . (ii) to evaluate the safety of vario us herbal extracts (St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, hops, lavender) in pregnancy, with an in vitro assessment of their cytotoxic and genotoxic potential in a placental cell line (BeWo b30). In addition, we aimed to characterize their impact on critical metabolic properties such as glucose consumption and lactate production, as well as their ability to induce or inhibit cell differentiation (Chapter 2) . (iii) to assess the influence of herbal extracts on the proteome of the placental cell line BeWo b3 0 and to establish a safety profile of some of the plant extracts active marker compounds such as hyperforin and hypericin (in St. John's wort), protopine (in California poppy), valerenic acid and valtrate (in valerian), and linalool (in lavender) using th e same plethora of in vitro assays as for the extracts (Chapter 3) . (iv) to clarify the permeation of hyperforin, hypericin, protopine, and valerenic acid across the placental barrier to better estimate the risk of fetal exposure using the ex vivo human placental perfusion model , and to investigate the translocation of valereni c acid across BeWo b30 cells by establishing an in vitro Transwell model (Chapter 4 and 5) . 2 2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 Perinatal Pharmacology During pregnancy, various physiological changes take place in the body of a woman over the course of nine months, some of which can affect the pharmacokinetics and thus the efficacy of drugs in very different ways, inevitably leading to adjustments (e.g., dose) during pregnancy to make therapy as effective and safe as possible. All proc esses of pharmacokinetics - from absorption, distribution, and metabolism to excretion of a drug - can be affected [1-3] and are discussed below. 2.1.1 Physiological and pharmacokinetic changes Absorption The physiological changes that occur during pregnancy include changes in the gastrointestinal tract, such as prolonged gastric emptying time (> 6 hours) due to decreased intestinal motility and increased gastric pH, which affect drug absorption when delivered via the oral route . Absorption of inhaled drugs may be enhanced due to increased cardiac output and tidal volume, which increase alveolar uptake, resulting in decreas ed dose requirements in pregnancy. Absorption of intramuscular administered drugs is also usually improved because tissue perfusion is increased because of vasodilation. Distribution During preg nancy, body composition changes , which is mainly associated with the increase of intravascular (plasma volume) and extravascular (breast s, uterus, peripheral oedema) body water content. Overall, the total body water increases by up to 8 liters, increasing the distribution volume in which hydrophilic drugs may distribute. Furthermore, the plasma concentrations of albumin - bound drugs decrease, as the protein concentration in the blood decreases due to increased water reabsorption. The cardiovascular system i s also more stressed during pregnancy, as blood volume, cardiac output, and heart rate increase. Lastly, th e additional utero -fetal compartment as well as the increase in body fat by approximately 4 kg change the distribution volume of certain drugs. The latter mainly affects lipophilic substances. 3 Metabolism Metabolism can be increased by elevated liver blood flow. Hormones such as estrogens and progesterone have an important influence on hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) activity, which induces or even completely inhibits some isoenzymes, leading to an altered metabolism and elimination. Furthermore, activity of phase II enzymes such as UDP -glucuron osyltransferases (UGT s) are increased in pregnancy. Elimination Renal blood flow is increased by 60 -80% during pregnancy, resulting in increased glomerular filtration. Due to this, the pregnant woman often notices increased urination (= physiological polyuria ). In addition, various transport proteins are induced in the kidney which further increase the active excretion of certain drugs. Although increased elimination results in slightly lower steady - state drug concentrations, dosages rarely need to be increased. Dose adjustment is required for various drug classes, such as for psychotropic drugs. A dose increase may be appropriate for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs ) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs ), both being metabolized at an accelerated rate via different CYPs during pregnancy. Dos e adjustment s in pregnancy should be based on an individual assessment of symptoms, and determination of plasma levels with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended. 2.1.2 Challe nges It is obvious f rom the Subsection 2.1.1 that those physiological changes affecting pharmacokinetics are complex and variable . Manufacturers rarely provide dosing information in pregnancy because drugs are often not approved for use in pregnancy and are therefore used off -label. This accounts for the lack of robust pharmacokinetic data. Pharmacotherapy in pregnancy is difficult and demanding: the therapy must be efficient for the mother and have as few side effects as possible; but must not harm the expect ed child. Caution is especially necessary in the first trimester, when the susceptibility to toxic effects on the developing organ systems and thus the risk of teratogenic damage is particularly high. The effects of drugs administered to the mother on the f etus are determined by the passage of the substances through the placental barrier. 4 2.2 Human placenta The human placenta is an organ with an extremely complex anatomy and a unique physiology. In the following sections, its formation, functions, and transport mechanisms will be discussed to understand the diversity of existing in vivo , ex vivo , and in vitro models. 2.2.1 Human p lacental development and anatomy Four days after fertilization , the morula (embryonic stage with 16 cells) develops into the blastocyst (32-64 cells). The placental development begins 6-7 days post -conception with the implantation of the blastocyst into the maternal uterine epithelium. The blastocyst consists of an in ner cell mass which forms the fetus and fetal membranes and an outer single layer of mononucleated trophoblast cells which form the placenta. When the blastocyst has firmly attached (day 8 post -conception) , some mononucleated trophoblast cells start to differentiate into the outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast, forming a complete mantel surrounding the conceptus. The remaining inner mononucleated trophoblasts are now refer red to as cytotrophoblast, are not in contact with the maternal tissues, but actively proliferat e and steadily fuse with the syncytiotrophoblast . The latter are responsible for the production of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( -hCG) by the second week post -conception, which is an indicator used in pregnancy testing. On day 9, lacunae or spaces form within the syncytiotrophoblast, allowing maternal blood from the uterine spiral arteries to enter the lacunar network , and an early uteroplacental circulation develops by the end of the 2nd week. These lacunae develop into intervillous space where the maternal blood leaves through endometrial veins. The remaining syncytiotrophoblast ic mass between the lacunae (known as trabeculae) are of great importance for the further development of the villous trees of the placenta , as they begin to develop the first side branches at about day 13 post -conception (primary chorionic villous). Subsequently, these syncytiotrophoblasts mature into secondary villi by growing of extraembryonic mesoderm into these villi, forming a core of loose c onnective tissue. The development of first placental vessels by the end of the third week transforms the respective villi into tertiary villi. The latter either grow outwards into the intervillous space (branching villi) , which then provide s a large surface are a for exchange between mother and fetus , or reach and contact the basal plate (anchoring villi) [4, 5] . The fetal -maternal barrier is relatively thick in th e first pregnancy trimester (week 1 -12 of gestation), since it then consists of the endothelial cells of the fetal capillaries and two continuous layers of trophoblast cells - an inner layer of cytotrophoblasts and an outer layer of multinucleated syncytio trophoblast s. This layer gets thinner during the progression of pregnancy and , at the same time , the number of fetal capillaries rises. In the third trimester (week 28 of gestation until birth) this fetal -maternal barrier decreases to only a few cytotrophoblasts and an outer layer of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast [6]. 5 Figure 1. Anatomy of the p . Photo source: logika600/Shutterstock [7] The full -term placenta (Figure 1) is a discoid circular organ which is torn from the uterine wall at birth. At term, the average placenta has a diameter of 22 cm, thickness of 2.5 cm, and weight of 470 g . Nevertheless, there are c onsiderable variations from placenta to placenta . The fetal surface (chorionic plate) is covered by the amnion - a single layered epithelium an d the amnionic mesenchyme - and is covered by chorionic vessels (arteries and veins) tha t converge toward the umbilical cord , which is usually attached in the middle of the placenta . The maternal surface (basal plate) has 10 -40 bulging regions called cotyledons , and the grooves correspond to the placental septa inside the placenta. Each maternal cotyledon is occupied by one to four villous trees and provides an average exchange area of up to 12.6 m2 at term [8]. The chorionic and basal plates merge at the placental margin and form the fetal membranes which are composed of the amnion, the chorion, ant the decidua capsularis [4]. The structure of the human placenta is very different from that of other mammals. A distinction is made between the hemochorial (e.g., in humans, rodents, primates), the endotheliochorial ( e.g., in dogs, cats) and the epitheliochorial ( e.g., in pigs, horses, s heep) placenta. A placenta is termed hemochorial when the maternal blood in the intervillous space is in direct contact with the fetal trophoblast. In the endotheliochorial placenta, the two are separated by an additional layer of maternal endothelial cell s or, in the case of the epitheliochorial placenta, by a layer of uterine epithelial cells. More s pecifically, the human placenta is a haemo mono chorial one 6 because it has a single trophoblast layer at the time of birth. In contrast, the mouse placenta has up to three trophoblast layers, making it a h aemotrichorial placenta. These and other anatomical and functional differences can lead to disparities between species, for example, in the transport of xenobiotics [8, 9] . 2.2.2 Physiological function The placenta is a highly specialized organ that plays a crucial and essential role during the nine months of pregnancy, performing various functions for the proper growth and development of the fetus. It supplies the developing fetus with blood, nutrients, and oxygen via the umbilical cord, while also regulating the removal of waste products and carbon dioxide. The placenta also protects the fetus from certain xenobiotics, infections ascending the reproductive tract, and maternal diseases. In addition, it i s capable of metabolizing substances and releasing hormones into the maternal or fetal circulation that influence the course of pregnancy, fetal metabolism and growth, and labor itself [10]. The consequences of any placental dysfunctions are detrimental to the fetus. Transport function The main role of the placenta is to nourish and protect the sensitive developing fetus . Since the lungs of the fetus are still maturing in utero and thus do not participate in gas exchange, the placenta is entirely responsible for the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the fetus via the maternal blood supply . In contrast, the placental barrier also serves to protect the unborn, as the latter is particularly vulnerable to potentially toxic exogenous substances and to disturbances of homeostasis. This is regulated by various active and passive transport mechanisms (see chapter 2.2.3) located in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and the endothelial layer of the fetal vessels. Among the most important are the transport of glucose , since the fetus has a small capacity for gluconeogenesis, amino acids for fetal protein synthesis, of electrolytes, vitamins, water, and fatty acids. The latter are needed for the production of compounds that are important in cell signaling (e.g. prostaglandins), as well as for the production of biological membranes a nd myelin [11]. Endocrine function hormones ( such as estrogens and progesterone ), and growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin - like growth factors (IGF), and platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) [10]. The hormone hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblasts early in pregnancy. It stimulates the corpus luteum to secrete 7 progesterone, which is of great importance for the continuation of the pregnancy. Furthermore, the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts is stimulated by hCG (as well as by estradiol and glucocorticoids ), a [10, 12] . The hormone also known as human chorionic somatomammotropin , is produced by the syncytiotrophoblasts. The hormone modifies the maternal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism throughout pregnancy to facilitate the energy supply of the fetus. In this context, it also reduces the insulin sensitivity of the expectant mother in order to increase the maternal blood glucose levels [11]. Leptin is another important signaling molecule of the reproductive system, secreted mainly by adipose tissue, but also by the trophoblastic cells of the placenta. Leptin seems to play a crucial role especially in the first stages of pregnancy, as it modula tes many critical processes (proliferation, protein synthesis, invasion, apoptosis) of placental cells and is therefore essential for normal placentation and fetal development. However, it also helps to promote breast development for later milk production. Deregulation of leptin levels has been associated with various serious outcomes, such as recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) , . Progesterone production begins in early stages of pregnancy and increases before labor to prevent uterine contractions and the onset of labor. Estrogens, on the other hand, stimulate the growth of the uterus and promote the development of the mammary glan ds [11]. Metabolic function The placenta is not merely known for its transport and endocrine function, but also as a detoxi fying and metabolizing unit of xenobiotics. Various CYPs are known to be present as phase I enzymes in the placenta, with type and amount of expression highly de pendent on the maternal health status and gestational period . More CYP is oforms are expressed in the first trimester, when the fetus is most susceptible to the effects of teratogens , than at term . In contrast, only a few phase II enzymes are present [8, 15] . Immunologic function Finally, the placenta also features an immune function , which plays a crucial role in the establishment, maintenance, and completion of a healthy pregnancy [16]. Although size is a limiting factor for proteins to cross the placental barrier, maternal Immunoglobulin G ( IgG) antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the fetus by pinocytosis (see Subsection 2.2.3). This transfer begins in early gestation and increases exponentially towards the end of pregnancy to provide passive immunity to the baby in the first months of life [11]. 8 2.2.3 Transport mechanisms Until the 1960s, it was assumed that the placenta is a perfect barrier against harmful environmental agents , which was disproved with the thalidomide tragedy [17]. Today, it is known that t he syncytiotrophoblast is the rate -limiting barrie r separating the maternal and fetal circulation of the human placenta. Various transporters and enzymes are located at the apical and basolateral membranes of the syncytiotrophoblast (Figure 2), which regulate the exchange of nutrients between mother and fetus - including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water - and eliminate metabolic waste products and hazardous chemicals from the fetu s [11, 18, 19] . Figure 2. Transport processes within the human placental barrier (adapted from [18]). BCRP: breast cancer 1; OCTN2: novel organic cation transporter 2 Passive diffusion Most dr ugs such as paracetamol and midazolam pass through the placenta via passive or simple diffusion, which occurs either transcellularly or paracellularly via aqueous channels that penetrate through the syncytiotrophoblast layer . This process occurs without an energy input as molecules are moved along a concentration gradient from areas of high to low concentration. This transport mechanism is not saturable and does not participate in competitive inhibition . However, the drug transfer across the placenta via passive diffusion depends on several physical and pharmacological factors such as placental surface area/thickness, pH of maternal and fetal blood, placental metabolism, molecular weight of the drug, lipid solubil ity (pKa), degree of ionization, protein binding, and concentration gradient across the placenta [8, 11, 20, 21] . 9 Facili tated diffusion Similar to passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion occurs along a concentration gradient whereby no energy inpu t is required. The main difference is that facilitated diffusion is carrier -mediated and requires a transport protein (carrier) for the transfer across the placental membrane. This process is inhibited when the carrier molecules are saturated by the substa nce itself, by competitive substrates, or by endogenous substrates competing for their use. Substances that are structurally related to endogenous compounds are often transported by facilitated diffusion (such as glucocorticoids or cephalosporins) [8, 11, 20, 21] . Active tran sport Active transport is also carrier -mediated and saturable, with competition between related molecules. The difference to other transport processes i s that energy, usually in the form of ATP, is used to transport substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient. The required energy can also be obtained from energy stored in the transmembrane, which is classified as secondary active co -transport and occurs through an ionic electrochemical gradient provided by H+, Na+, or Cl- [19]. The transporters are located either on the fetal basolateral side (mostly uptake carriers) , or on the maternal membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast (mostly efflux carriers) [21], allowing essential nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, iron, and calcium to be transported to the fetus , and xenobiotics a nd other undesirable substances to be removed from the fetal circulation . A variety of active transporters have been identified in the placenta, including the expression of members of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance proteins family in the human term placenta [8, 11, 20 -22]. destruction of extracellular material) and receptor - mediated endocytosis. The latter consists of internalization of selective extracellular ligands (e.g., IgG- or IgG -based antibodies) into cytoplasmic vesicles, with the rate of transfer depending on several factors , such as membrane fluidity, vesicle mobility in the cytosol , and the rate of receptor turnover [21]. All mechanisms are driven by intracellular membrane vesicles to release the transported substance (e.g., nanoparticles or liposomes) on the opposite side. However, endocytosis is a minor route of mass transfer for drugs, as this process is too slow to exhibit relevant drug concentration on the fetal side of the placenta [8]. 10 2.2.4 Models to study placental transfer Complex questions arise when administering drugs to pregnant women in terms of placental drug transfer and metabolism. Pregnant women are usually excluded from clinica l trials due to ethical aspects. It is therefore understandable why pharmaceutical companies generally label drugs as contraindicated or not approved for pregnant women (or during breastfeeding) [8]. Therefore, a variety of models have been developed for studying the placental transfer and metabolism of substances/xenobiotics. These models partially resolve the ethical and methodological problems, but they are not without limitations. In vitro models cannot fully account for the multitude of physiological changes in the mother, placenta, and fetus which occur throughout the pregnancy, while in vivo studies prevent a direct extrapolation of results because of anatomical and functional differences between mammalian placentas [8]. In vivo models Anima l models Many placental transfer studies have been performed in rodent models , such as in mice and rats [23], in situ placental perfusion techniques have been established in small animals (guinea pigs, rabbits) , and c hronically cannulated sheep have been used extensively [24]. However, for all animal models, extrapolation of the results to humans is limited due to large interspecies differences . The placenta of non -human primates , such as rhesus monkeys , is the most similar to the human placenta, as the maternofetal tissue layer s are also classified as haemomonochorial according to the Grosser classification, and the macrostructure and maternofetal blood flow 24] . Additionally , animal experiments pose ethical and financial hurdles in addition to the aforementio ned limitations [25]. Fetal/maternal blood concentration ratio Determination of the ratio between fetal and maternal blood concentrations is the simplest and most defensible index for placental transfer in vivo . For this purpose, blood samples are taken simultaneously from a peripheral vein (maternal blood) and from t he umbilical cord (fetal blood). Many studies have estimated this ratio after administration of a single dose, which may not be a reliable estimate because it may lead to ratios with a high variability. More meaningful information about the drug distributi on between those two circulations can be obtained by maternal drug infusions (starting with a loading dose) to maintain a constant maternal drug concentration [8]. Disadvantages of this method are the difficulties in assessing the influence of placental metabolism on drug transfer and the lack of information on tissue distribution and accumulation [15]. The 11 method can be further expanded by performing placenta biopsies to investigate the maternal - placental or fetal -placental concentration ratios [26]. Coelocentesis This technique was introduced in 1991 as an alternative to fetal blood sampling. It involves sampling from human exocoelom ic and amniotic fluid via transvaginal puncture early in pregnancy (weeks 5-13). This method is suitable for the study of placental transfer, but not for the kinetics of compounds [26-28]. Ex vivo model Human placental perfusion The current gold -standard among the placental transfer models is the ex vivo human placental perfusion (Figure 3) using placentae that are obtained immediately after delivery (both vaginal births and cesarean sections) [29, 30] . Figure 3. Ex vivo placental perfusion model to investigate transplacental transfer. The model was first described by Panigel et al. [31] in 1967 and was further developed by Schneider et al. [32], and since its introduction the number of perfusions has steadily increased [24, 26] . Advantages of this model are that the structur e of the cotyledon is fully preserved [33], the cells in 12 perfused placentae remain technically viable for up to 48 h [26], and data obtained are highly predictive of the in vivo transfer [34]. Furthermore , the procedure is non -invasive for both, the mother and child, which creates a minimum of ethical issues. In addition to information about the transplacental transfer, the model also offers investigation of placental metabolism and fetal metabolites, preferential direction of transport and the presence and involvement of transporters, and acute toxicity [26]. The main drawback of this model is that the placenta only reflects the situation at the end of a pregnancy , and not that of the first trime ster in which the susceptibility of the fetus to toxic hazards is high. However, it is possible that the placenta might be more sensitive to environmental substances at term , as the cell layer thickness decreases toward the end of pregnancy. In addition, t he involvement of placental transport mechanisms and metabolism within the tissue may be underestimated because they have run down at the time of delivery compared to first trimester placenta e [33]. Due to interindividual variation, a large number of placenta e may need to be perfused to obtain reproducible results, which is very time and labor intensive [15, 24] . The method itself is described in Chapter 4. Non -human placental perfusion Ex vivo perfusion (rats [35] and mice [36]) have also been used for an early screening of substance transfer across the placental barrier , again raising the issue of comparability to the situation in pregnant women. In vitro models In vitro models utilizing well -established trophoblast -derived immortal human placental cell lines (e.g., BeWo, J AR, JEG -3 cells) which originate from choriocarcinoma cells or human placental primary cells (villous trophoblasts) and explant tissue have been employed. These latter models enable the study of various factors affecting the transplacental transport, such as uptake, efflux, and metabolism . Furthermore, they can replace or reduce the number of animal testing and elude the ethical and methodological hurdles of in vivo studies [25]. However, all cell -based placental models lack the cellular organization, compartmentalization and 3 -dimensional structure of intact, physiologically active placentae [37]. Placental cell models The classical approach to model the placental barrier in vitro is the Transwell system (Figure 4), which has been widely used to study the transport of a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds [38, 39] . Furthermore, the model is used to study trophoblast differentiation [40], placental metabolism, and nutrient and drug distribution across the placental barrier [15]. 13 Figure 4. In vitro Transwell model with BeWo b30 cells to investigate transplacental transfer. Cells (e.g. BeWo b30 ) are thereby cultured on semi -permeable membrane until they form confluent monolayers . The BeWo b30 cell line is a clone of the BeWo cell line which was originally derived from a human choriocarcinoma and has been most used . The original BeWo cell line , however , is controversially discussed if it has the same monolayer -forming abilities in culture as the BeWo b30 cl one [41, 42] and may therefore be less suitable as a representative model of transepithelial barrier . Other human trophoblast -derived cell lines such as J AR, JEG-3, and ACH - 3P have differences in cellular function and should be chosen carefully depend ing on the original research question [43]. The value of cell lines as a model highly depend s on their similarity to normal trophoblastic cells . However, the isolation of primary cytotrophoblasts from the human placenta brings a high risk for contamination , and the cells are not viable for many pas sages [44]. Moreover, these do not form a confluent monolayer [45]. In general, the cell lines are comparatively easy to handle , and the Transwell model is suitable for long -term exposure studies. In addition, a good correlation between results of ex vivo perfusion of human placenta and in vitro BeWo b30 cells in the Transwell model was demonstrated with several model substrates [38, 46] . The major drawbacks of the experimental model are the absence of blood flow and the simplification of the cellular complexity of a placenta. For the latter reason, more complex Transwell models have been developed in which epithelial cell lines such as pure vascular endothelial cell line from the human placenta (HPEC ) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are used for coculture with the trophob last cell lines to better reflect the physiological situation in vivo [25, 47, 48] . As an alternative, 3D cell models can be used to study the human organ physiology, allowing the cells to self-organize into spheroid - or organoid -like structures . Finally, there are placenta -on-a-chip (PoC) models are relying on microfluidic channels to g enerate flow. 14 Placental tissue explants Placental tissue can be cultured in vivo as tissue explants to investigate the transport of substances from the maternal circulation into the syncytiotrophoblast, as well as the metabolism of xenobiotics , enzyme and endocrine function, cellular proliferation, and differentiation . The tissue can be obtained from different stages of gestation ( early vs. terminated pregnancy ) and can be in culture for up to 11 days. Other advantages include the intact microarc hitecture and maintenance of cell -cell interactions and paracrine communications in explants . Disadvantages of this model are that (i) the explant culture is very sensitive to environmental influences and therefore needs to be closely monitored, (ii) the b lood flow cannot be simulated , and (iii) it is difficult to perform good kinetic transfer studies [44, 49, 50] . Placental membrane vesicles This model allows the study of the expression and functionality of specific transporters of the fetal as well as maternal plasma membrane s since membrane vesicles can be isolated in a relatively purely form from the brush border or from the fetal-facing basal membrane of trophoblasts. However, these plasma membrane vesicles lack intracellular components , which limits the study of regulatory processes using signaling cascades , and an estimation of the transporter activity contribution in vivo is not possible [15, 51] . In silico models Several types of in silico models are available to predict different aspects of placental physiology and pathology . The p hysiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and quantitative structure -activity relationship (QSAR) model , for example, focus on the barrier transport of xenobio tics. These models have no ethical or financial constraints [25]. 15 2.3 Mild m ental disorders and/o r symptoms in pregnancy Two main classification systems are used to diagnose mental disorders: the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -10) [52], which is published by the World Health Organization ( WHO ), and the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5) [53]. These two classification systems cover a wide range of relevant mental disorders. However, this work focuses on NMDs , which include mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and sleep dis orders. They are often less severe than psychotic disorders, and symptoms depend on the disorder, but may include agitation, depressed mood, irritability, lack of energy, restlessness, social withdrawal, and insomnia among others [54]. 2.3.1 Prevalence Pregnancy is a vulnerable period for NMDs. This was illustrated by a meta -analysis that included thirteen publications from seventeen different (low er-middle -income) countries which reported a prevalence of 15.6% in pregnancy [55]. A population -based study of pregnant women during the second trimester at two obstetric clinics in Sweden found , that psychiatric disorders were present in 14.1% of the women, among of which only 5.5% were being treated [56]. This has also been observed in the USA using a screening questionnaire, where 20.0% of pregnant women showed a depressive symptomatology, with only 13.8% reporting a formal treatment for depression [57]. Comparable data exist in Switzerland, where the annual rate of perinatal women using mental health services ac counts for 16.7% [58], clearly underlining the vulnerability of pregnant women to mental disorders. 2.3.2 Treatment Antidepressants The mainstay of pharmacological treatment for NMDs in the perinatal per iod is antidepressants (Table 1). The SSRIs are the most used and researched (1st option) , followed by serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors option ) and TCAs [59, 60] . 16 Table 1. General o verview of different types of antidepressants with some representatives registered on the Swiss pharmaceutical market In general, SSRIs are the first choice for mild to moderate depression and may also be used for anxiety disorders, panic disorders, or obsessive -compulsive disorders. Possible side effects may include gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea), insomnia and agitation, or sexual dysfunction [61]. The results on their influence on pregnancy outcome are contradictory. To date, most stud ies associated the exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy with preterm birth, lower birth weight, and withdrawal symptoms in infants among others (see [62] for additional references). A neonatal adaptation synd rome (NAS) with irritability, abnormal crying, agitation, lethargy, tremor, feeding difficulty, and dyspnea is well -documented and occurs in up to 30% of exposed infants [59, 63] . In addition, the risk of congenital malformations is increased [64-66], and specifically cardiac malformations have been reported [66]. On the other hand, a large cohort study failed to demonstrate an association between SSRIs and the increase of cardiac malformations [27]. Comparing different guidelines on treatment of perinatal depression with antidepressants, citalopram (Figure 5) and fluoxetine are mentioned as preferred medication, although their use during pregnancy remains controversial [67]. Late pregnancy exposure to SSRIs, as citalopram, is associated with poor neonatal adaptation syndrome , including symptoms such as constant crying, respiratory difficulty, eating and sleeping difficulties, increased muscle tone, seizures and irritability in general [68]. Figure 5. Chemical structure of citalopram - a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 17 For paroxetine, an association between the use during pregnancy and congenital heart defects has been demonstrated [64], and it should be avoided in the first trimester, despite the very low risk (see [59] for additional references). For persistent pulmonary hypertension, a rare but fatal disorder in up to 15%, the risk is slightly increased for all SSRIs versus 0.12%) [69, 70]. inhibitors general, i f SSRIs are not sufficiently effective, SNRIs may be an alternative treatment option, although gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea ), insomnia, and restlessness or sexual dysfunction may also be among the possible side effects. However, compared with SS RIs, side effects and side - effect -related discontinuations are more common among SNRIs [61]. There is insufficient information available for SNRIs in pregnancy with regard to long -term effects, and they must therefore be used with caution and after careful consideration (benefits vs. risks) [59, 71] . A comprehensive cohort study (sibling controlled design) failed to show an association between in utero venlafaxine exposure and the increase for cardiac malformations [72]. Tricyclic antidepressants In general, TCAs bl ock and thus inactivation of norepinephrine and serotonin presynaptically. They have more side effects than SSRIs, particularly sedative and anticholinergic ones (such as dry mouth and constipation), orthostatic hypotension, and weight gain. I n overdose, these agents can cause moderate to high lethality [61].TCA exposure in pregnancy slightly increases the risk for complications (preterm birth and low birth weight), general malformations, and cardiovascular defects during pregnancy compared to SSRIs [64]. Anxiolytics Benzodiazepines The first choice for women to treat anxiety disorders are antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs), although benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, diazepam, or lorazepam) may also be useful if necessary . In addition, benzodiazepines and other hypnotics (non -benzodia zepines) may also be useful for intermittent insomnia [59]. The anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines is immediate and, in contrast to antidepressants, does not lead to restlessness and nervousness at the beginning of treatment. Because of the potential for dependence, the fast tolerance development, and the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation, treatment with benzodiazepines requires an adequate risk -benefit assessment. In addition, l ong-term use is not recommended (maximum 4 18 weeks) [73]. Diazepam (Figure 6) is a particularly well -known benzodiazepine and is often prescribed during pregnancy. While diazepam use during gestation has no adverse effects on the development of the exposed child, its use in the weeks before delivery may provoke neonatal withdrawal syndrome, floppy infant syndrome , or various acute toxic effects in the newb orn [74]. Figure 6. Chemical structure of diazepam - a benzodiazepine Hypnotics Hypnotics (non -benzodiazepines) such as zolpidem or zopiclone may be useful for the treatment of intermittent insomnia. However, the fetal risks of the active pharmaceutical ingredients have not been equally well studied to date and should therefore be wel l weighed against the benefits and/or alternatives [59]. As shown, treatment of mental diseases with conventional medications during pregnancy has several disadvantages. In a questionnaire distributed to pregnant women in obstetric clinics in the Canton of Zurich, only a very small number of participants reported the use of sedatives/anxiolytics or antidepressants during pregnancy in comp arison to before getting pregnant [75]. However, untreated NMDs themselves should be categorically avoided . For instance, untreated depression during pregnancy is linked to poor birth outcomes ( preterm birth, low birth weight , fetal intrauterine growth retardation ), and it can have a variety of negative effects on women (disrupted sleep, increased risk of suicide, increased exposure to illicit drugs) . Furthermore, untreated major depression during pregnancy is the most robust predictor of postpartum depression [76-79]. Based on these arguments, we investigated the safety of various herbal medicines which may be promising options to treat mild NMDs in pregnancy. 19 2.4 Herbal medicine 2.4.1 Historical background Herbal medicines represent the oldest source of pharmacotherapy , and a rchaeological evidence revealed that the use of medicinal plants dates to the Paleolithic age approximately 60'000 years ago. The earliest records about the medicinal use of over 250 various plants were from Mesopotamia (2600 BCE) written on clay tablets , followed by the best known Egyptian pharmaceutical record Ebers Papyrus (1550 BCE) which contains about 700 herbal medicines including their dosage forms . [80, 81] . Dioscorides (1st century AD) , is known as the \"father of pharmacognosy\" and the important author of the work De Materia Medica (77 AD ), which includes a description of 944 drugs (657 of which are of plant origin ). The descriptions include information on the appearance, place of discovery, occurrence/cultivation, collection mode , medicinal preparation, and therapeutic effect. This work of ancient history, together with the book Historia naturalis by Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) , which includes over 1000 medicinal plants, was the bas is of knowledge on medicinal plants until the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The term phytotherapy was introduced into medical science only later by the French physician Henri Leclerc (1870 -1955). Modern phytotherapy is not part of alternative medi cine and is fundamentally different from homeopathy and anthroposoph ic medicine . In contrast to conventional pharmacotherapy, phytotherapy only uses active ingredients that consist of plant parts (e.g. flowers, roots), constituents (e.g. essential oils) or their preparations (e.g. dry extracts, tinctures, pressed juices) [82]. Nowadays, according to the WHO , about 75% of the world's population rely on herbal medicines for primary health care [80]. In addition, the phytochemicals present in herbs are being actively investigated for the development of new (synth etic) drugs and are therefore an important and indispensable source in drug discovery [83]. For instance, i n 2001, a total of 122 compounds /structures from 94 different plant species were id entified which are nowadays used as drugs worldwide [84]. 20 2.4.2 Regulatory aspects National regulations In Switzerland, a marketing authorization is required for herbal medicines with specified indications, and the quality, safety and efficacy must be demonstrated. The regulatory requirements for safety assessment are the same as for conventional pharmaceuticals . Sufficient is either a simplified marketing authorization procedure for traditional use of the h erbal medicines ( without proven adverse effects) or, where appropriate, clinical trials may be replaced by scientific literature or proof of pharmaceutical or therapeutic equivalence with an already approved product to demonstrate efficacy and safety [85, 86] . Regulation in the European Union Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products mon ographs With the European Union ( EU) Directive 2001/83/EC Article 10a , the possibility was created to obtain a marketing authorization for herbal medicinal products only based on safety and efficacy data from the literature, which is referred to as \"well -established use\". However, since there are also many products that have a long tradition of use ( 30 years), but whose efficacy is difficult to substantiate by clinical studies or literature evidence according to the current requirements , Directive 2002/24/EC established the possibility of facilitated registration as a tradi tional herbal medicinal product (\"traditional use\") in the European directive system. Overall, however, the efficacy justification including dosage and dosage form must be plausible. The Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) was established as par t of the central regulatory authority EMA (European Medicines Agency), in which every EU member state s are represented. Since 2008, the Committee has been reviewing and evaluating available scientific material and subsequently producing monographs that are intended to be binding for the regulatory authorities in all countries of the EU [82]. European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy monographs The European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) was founded in 1989 as an umbrella organization representing national herbal medicine and phytotherapy societies throughout Europe. ESCOP members include various EU Member States , as well as Switzerland and Turkey. It is primarily engaged with the establishment of herbal medicine monographs, which are based on published data and have a high scientific value , as they contain detailed information on: phytochemistry , use, dosage, side effects, contraindications, interactions, and results from 21 pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical studies. Another objective of ESCOP is to harmonize the regulatory status ( marketing authorization) of herbal medicinal products within Europa [82]. World Health Organization monographs The monographs of the WHO serve to harmonize the quality and the traditional and modern clinical use of medicinal plants internationally . They are intended to support the development of national formulations and to help developing countries regulate their pharmaceutical markets . The selection of drugs is therefore primarily based on those used worldwide with common indications [82]. 2.4.3 Use in pregnancy Midwives are the primary practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) during pregnancy, particularly in the areas of homeopathy, acupuncture and phytotherapy , which are of significant importance as 43.2% (205/475) of women undergoing pregnancy choose CAM treatment [87]. A German study reported that about one third of pregnant women take herbal medicines with regard to the treatment of psychological problems [88]. Use of herbal medicines in pregnancy was also reported in a multinational study (28.9%, 2'735/9'459), with significant geographic variation (e.g., 40.6% in Switzerland) and mostly se lf-medicated. The five most commonly used herbal medicines were ginger, cranberry, valerian, raspberry, and chamomile , although is in some cases little is known about their efficacy and safety [89]. Despite this lack, a variety of CAM therapies, including herbal medicine, are recommended to pregnant women by healthcare professionals involved in the care of pregnant women (e.g. midwifes, obstetricians, anesthetists ) - much more often by those who use CAM themselves [90]. In contrast, a cross - sectional survey in the United States reve aled that 50% of CAM users (including herbal medicine) reported not discussing its use with their obstetricians. Therefore, health professionals should actively inquire about the herbal medicines used and should be informed on safety issues [91, 92] . A number of reviews [93-97] and studies [98] have already addressed whether herbal medicines can be considered safe in pregnancy. They also point out the potential for interaction and toxicity of herbal medicines and emphasize that women and health professionals need to move away from the idea that herbal medicines are not harmful [99]. Alternative approaches to clinical trials on drug safety during pregnancy rely on information from toxicology centers [100] or pharmacovigilance services [101] , both of which are valuable sources of information. 22 2.4.4 Potential plants used in the treatment of mild mental disorders St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, hops, and lavender are s ome well -known herbal medications for the treatment of NMDs (Table 2). Besides their prominence , they exert many pharmacological activities and some of their ingredients are of great interest. Table 2. Detailed o verview of plants used for the treatment of NMD including scientific name, drug parts used, typical ingredient(s) and clinical effects [82, 102] , and recommend ed maximal daily dose of a representative medicinal product [61].

However, some of them have primarily different indications , such as hypertension or premenstrual symptoms. Table 3. Summary of plants that exhibit anxiolytic, sedative, and/or antidepressant activities, among others [82].

Figure 7) belongs to the family of Hypericaceae and has many German synonyms such as Blutkraut, Johannisblut, Sonnwendkraut, and Hexenkrau t. The plant is also called dotted or perforated St. John's wort, referring to the clearly visible oil glands (predominantly blood -red to black hypericin vessels) on the flowers and leaves, which is where the Latin species name perforatum comes fro m. Hypericu m, however, comes from the Greek hyperikon , which is composed of the word roots \"hyper\" (over) and \"eikon\" (image , apparition ), as the plant is supposedly warding off evil spirits. The herbaceous perennial plant, about 40-80 cm high , has bright yellow flowers with four to five petals, numerous long stamens, and a single pistil . The species is a native of Europe is nowadays mainly cultivated in Germany, Eastern Europe, and Chile, and is found in the wild only in small quantities [103-105]. Figure 7. St. John's Historical use St. John's wort has a long history as an antidepressant, antiseptic, anti -inflammatory, expectorant, and immune system booster . According to the first reports, the herb was used as early as the 1st century AD by the Greek herbalist Dios corides, and later by the herbalist/alchemist Paracelsus (1493 -1541) who recommended St. John's wort preparations to and alleviate pain and treat wounds [104] . Then, in 1525, Paracelsus suggested to use St. John's wort for the treatment of depression, melancholia and overexcitability [107] . The name of the plant refers to the birthday of St. John the Baptist on June 24. Christians probably gave the name to the plant, noticing that the herb is in full bloom at this time. Today, St. John's wort is one of the most popular remedies available in various forms (capsules, liquid extracts, oils, ointments, etc.) and is mainly used to treat mild to moderate depressi on. Interestingly, this was already recognized by Hildegard of Bingen (1098 -1179), who said about the plant that it was a \"suitable herb against black melancholy\" [105, 108] . 25 2.5.2 Phytochemistry St. John's wort numerous groups of natural compounds with the naphthodianthrones, phloroglucin ols, and flavonoids being the most common classes. The most extensively researched class of isolated compounds are the naphthodianthrones (drug contains 0.1 -0.3%) , the so -called , pseudohypericin, isohypericin. Of these, the highly photoreactive hyperic in (Table 4) is the best studied and is particularly found in the black dots in the flowers, being responsible for the red color of St. John's wort oils . Another class of compound are the lipophilic phlor oglucin derivatives (drug contains 0.2-0.4%) , with the main components hyperforin (Table 4) and adhyperforin , as well as their degradation products. Hyperforin is unstable in the presence of oxygen and light [109] . Flavonoids many more which are all biogenetically related. In addition, St. John's wort contains small amounts of essential oil, which mainly consists of sesq uiterpenes (caryophyllene, spathulenol, etc.) Molecular 536.78 504.44 Hydrogen -Donors 1 6 Hydrogen -Acceptors 4 8 Rotatable bonds 11 0 Rings 2 8 Lipinski violations 2 3 Solubility in water 26 2.5.3 Pharmacological activities St. John's wort exerts a antiviral, anti-cancerous, antioxidant , neuroprotective ), the most important of which is, of course, the antidepressant activity [110, 112] . The plant contains numerous bioactive compounds , inclu ding hyperforin and hypericin [113] initially attributed the antidepressant effect to hypericin , which was found to i nhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes type A and B in rat brain mitochondria (significant inhibition only at very high hypericin concentrations) [114] . However , the effect is likely due to the combination of several plant constituents , including hyperforin , which is a potent a mechanism of action, as it activates canonical trans ient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC 6), causing the entry of calcium and sodium ions into cells, thereby reducing the cation gradient that controls monoamine neurotransmitter uptake. Thus, the mechanism of action of hyperforin differs from conventional antidepressants, which inhibit neurotransmitter transporter proteins directly [116, 117] . Additionally, the presence of different flavonoids, such as hyperoside, isoquercitrin, and rutin, may modulate t he antidepressant effect of St. John's wort [118] . St. John's wort can interact with various medications, including antidepressants, oral contraceptives, immunosuppressants, and anticoagulants. The herb can reduce the effectiveness of these medications by increasing their metabolism and decreasing their blood levels [112, 119] . One of the primary compounds thought to be responsible for St. John's wort's interactions with certain medications is hyperforin [120] . Therefore, t he risk of herb -drug interactions may be influenced by the choice of St. John's wort product, as the amount of hyperforin can vary widely [121] . 2.5.4 Clinical evidence in the treatment of mild mental disorders The antidepressant efficacy of extracts of St. John's wort has been confirmed in several clinical studies : A meta -analysis of twenty -seven studies revealed that the herbal antidepressant did not differ in efficacy from SSRIs , and treatment of mild -to-moderate depression with St. John's wort extract resu lted in fewer adverse events and thus fewer treatment discontinuations [122] . This analysis included a study that enrolled 135 patients with a major depression disorder and found that a (hyperforin -rich) standardized extract of St John's wort was more effective than fluoxetine and placebo in treatment over a 12 -week period [123] . St. John's wort extract was also therapeutically equivalent to imipramine - a TCA - in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, but was better tolerated by the 324 patients included, as shown in a randomized, multicenter , double -blind study [124] . Another systematic review, which included 35 studies, 27 associated St. John's wort with more treatment responders and fewer adverse effects than placebo and standard antidepressant intervention s (including psychotherapy and antidepressant medication) [125] . 2.5.5 In pregnancy Safety St. John's wort is one of the most frequently used herbal medicines in pregnancy [96]. However, the results of animal studies, most of which have methodological limitations, are inconclusive [126] , and the potential risk to pregnant women is still unclear, as only a few studies are available [127, 128]. In an in vivo study with 54 rats, t here was evidence of a reduced number of offspring with St. John's wort exposure prior to conception, and prolonged duration of pregnancy and worsened fetal development (reduced body weight) with exposure during pregnancy. Therefore , they do not recommend the intake of St. John's wort to women who want to become pregnant or are pregnant, as it may be harmful to the fetal and maternal health [129] . An in vitro study showed that hyperfo rin inhibited cell proliferation and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells [33]. An in vitro study showed that hyperforin at typical doses has only a low risk of embryotoxicity , but when ingested in large amounts can result in the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells, which may pose embryotoxic and teratogenic risks to pregnant women [130] . A review from 2014 [95] assessed St. John's wort as well tolerated and safe in pregnancy, although the data are based on only one case report [131] and one prospective, observational study [128] . A recent study of St. John's wort -exposed pregnancies which is based on claims data showed that the administr ation mainly occurred in the first trimester in 420 /496 (84.7%) of pregnancies . However, unlike other antidepressants, it was used as an alternative in only a minority. Overall, 11% of pregnancies ended in non-live births and m ajor malformations were noted in 18/312 babies (5.8%), 17 of whom were St. John's wort exposed in the first trimester. The relative risk of major malformations in babies exposed to St. John's wort during the first trimester compared with those exposed only during the second or third trimester was 3.56 (0.48 -26.17). The relatively high rates of non-live births and malformations after first trimester exposure to St. John's wort should be interpreted with caution , yet the results are conspicuous [132] . 28 Recommendations for clinical practice European Medicines Agency The HMPC of the EMA does not recommend the use of St. John's wort during pregnancy and lactation due to equivocal results in animal studies and insufficient clinical data [133, 134] . Embryotox According to t he Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology at the Hospital Charit\u00e9 in Berlin , St. John's wort is considered a \"drug\" with conflicting or insufficient study data. Therefore, they recommend that the use of St. John's wort for depressive disorders is acceptable during pregnancy, if interactions with comedications (cave: induction of P-gp and CYPs [119] ) are reviewed. The implications of its use in pregnancy are careful pregnancy monitoring and close psychiatric contacts to counteract crises in the mother and developmental compli cations in the fetus (preterm birth aspirations, growth retardation) in a timely manner. They suggest sertraline or citalopram as f\u00fcr perinatale Pharmakologie Data in humans to date do not indicate a significantly increased risk of teratogenicity, but the data are not extensive enough to make a firm statement. Therefore, even in the absence of interacting comedication, use in pregnancy should only be undertaken after consideration of various alternatives [136] . 29 2.6 California poppy California poppy ( Eschscholzia californica Cham ., Figure 8) belongs to the poppy family of Papaveraceae , and is also called Goldmohn or Schlafm\u00fctzchen in German. The plant is a 30 -60 cm tall annual to perennial herb with sparse fern -like blue-green foliage. The four -petaled silky- textured flowers, solitary on long stems, are pale yellow to orang e in color with numerous yellow stamens. California poppy is native in the United States of America ( USA; from California to New Mexico) and is mainly grown in the south of France. An ornamental plant exists in Europe since the mid -19th century which is a hybrid of several subspecies/varieties of the species Eschscholzia californica [137] Vladyslav/Shutterstock [138] poppy was first described by Adelbert von Chamisso, a German botanist, in 1820. Chamisso was participating in a scientific expedition from 1815 -1818 and was a naturalist on the Russian ship Rurik, which was led by Otto von Kotzebue. The Rurik landed in San Francisco in October, and the California poppy was among the few plants still in bloom. Chamisso named the genus in honor of his friend Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz, the physici an and naturalist who also took part in the expedition [139] . As a result, the flower is now known as the state flower of California and is therefore depicted on numerous welcome or street signs. Traditionally, California poppy was used by the Native American population in the western USA as a sedative and analgesic. According to the Handbook of Medicinal Herbs, California poppy is reported to [140] . Today the herb is mostly used and known for its sedative and analgetic properties. The herbal medicine has been available as a powdered dry herb in hard capsules on the European market (France and Spain) since 1982, hence its traditional use in Europe [141] . In Switzerland, the medicinal drug can be obtained in pharmacies 30 and drugstores as capsules containing the powdered herb (Arkocaps\u00ae Escholtzia, Arko Diffusion S.A., Geneva ) [61]. 2.6.2 Phytochemi stry The chemical composition of the California poppy is well known. The entire plant contains alkaloids, although the composition varies considerably in the different organs (e.g., aerial parts, roots, stems, leaves, flowers, capsule valves, seeds). The r oots are richer with 2.7% alkaloids in contrast to reported 0.29 -0.38% alkaloids in the herb [137] . Six different groups of alkaloids have been describ ed so far including the pavin e alkaloids (e.g. californidine, escholtzine ) which are most and characteristic of protopine alkaloids et al., the alkaloids in the aerial parts of the plant consist californidine, compounds Protopine Chemical structure Empirical formula H19 NO 5 Molecular weight (g/mol) 353.37 Hydrogen -Donors 0 Hydrogen -Acceptors 6 Rotatable bonds 0 Rings 5 Lipinski violations 0 Solubility in water (mg/mL, 25\u00b0C) oc/w 2.91 2.6.3 Pharmacological activities California anxiolytic effects in vivo [143, 144] , and these properties have been traditionally attributed to the isoquinoline alkaloids (such as californidine and eschscholzine) [141] . The aqueous alcohol extract of California poppy showed affinity for GABA receptors in mice, explaining the sedative and anxiolytic effects. In addition, the extract also elicited NO OO OO31 peripheral analytic effects but did not possess antidepressant, neuroleptic, or antihistaminic effects [145] . Several in vitro studies suggest that the plant contains several central nervous system (CNS )- active compound s. Protopine and allocryptopine were found to bind to GABA A receptors in r at synaptic membrane preparations [146, 147] and are also inhibitors of serotonin and noradrenaline transporters expressed in murine S6 and N1 cells, respectively [148] . In addition, they also act as anti-inflammatory agents and as ace tyl-cholinesterase inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo [149] . The aporphine alkaloid ligand at serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors expressed in human CHO cell membranes [150] . However, it must be noted that some of those pharmacological effects only occur at a certain amount of alkaloids (micromolar range). However, the total amount of alkaloids from a conventional OTC preparation (300 mg) would be too low (submicromolar range) to cause these desired biological effects in vitro and in vivo [151] . In addition, the alcoholic extract of California poppy and its major alkaloids (protopine, escholtzine, allocryptopine, and californidine ) have the potential to inhibit the metabolism of various CYPs, which may result in diverse drug -drug interac tions [152] ). 2.6.4 Clinical evidence in the treatment of mild mental disorders The plausibility of the efficacy is based only on long -standing use and experience, and there only are few clinical studies available. In an open -label study, 60 patients (38 women, 20 men, 2 children) suffering from sleep disorders were treated with California poppy for 6 months. Subsequently, 43% of patients reported excellent results (improved sleep quality); 43% of patients reported good results, while 14% discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy [141] . A fixed combination of California poppy and valerian was beneficial in the treatment of insomnia in an observational study in adults (increasing night sleep duration and sleep efficiency, decreasing the numb er of awakenings and anxiety score) [153] . The efficacy of California poppy together with hawthorn ( Crataegus oxyacantha ) and magnesium in treatment of anxiety disorders was investigated in a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trial . In a total of 264 patients, the above -mentioned plant combination ( and magnesium) was safe and more effective than placebo in the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety diso rders [144] . Another open -label study - including 20 patients with chronic pain - focused on the analgesic efficacy evidence, while also collecting information on the safety of the product . A questionnaire was also used to assess insomnia. A standardized California poppy extract was therefore administered once or twice daily for up to one month. The authors concluded that this plant extract can be used to treat chronic (as well as mild to m oderate nocturnal) pain and as a mild sedative to treat pain -related insomnia [141] . A review from 2013 suggested California poppy for the treatment of anxiety disorders based on the available preclinical studies [154] . 32 2.6.5 In pregnancy Safety There is no in vitro data on the genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity regarding the herbal extract and constituents thereof. Recommendations for clinical practice European Medicines Agency The HMPC of the EMA does not recommend the use of California poppy during pregnancy and lactation due to the absence of sufficient data and not yet established safety profile [155] Valeriana officinalis L., Figure 9), also referred to as common valerian or garden valerian , is a perennial plant belong ing to the family of Caprifoliaceae . The roots and rhizome of the plant are used as a drug . With pinnate le aves and sweet -smelling pink or white flowers , valerian grow between 30-150 cm tall , depending on the cultivar . The plant is native to Europe and Asia and has naturalized in northeastern America. Valerian is primarily sourced from crops in the Netherlands , Belgium, and Eastern Europe, but is nowadays increasingly cultivated in Germany [103] . Figure 2.7.1 Historical use Valerian has a long history of medicinal use, dating back to the era of the Greek physicians Hippocrates (460 -377 AD) and Dioscorides, who used the dry root as a remedy for liver diseases, urinary tract complications , and menstrual cram ps. In Europe, the use of valerian as a monotherapy was first described by Hahnemann (1793 -1799) for the treatment of epilepsy, various convulsions, worm diseases and hysterical complaints. Chamisso (1781 -1831) also describes valerian root as antispasmodic , effective against worm diseases and as strengthening. Valerian was first mentioned in connection with sleeplessness in 1976, among many other effects such as antihysteric, aphrodisiac, diuretic, analgesic, antitussive, etc. [157] . Today, valerian is a traditional herbal medicinal product used to relieve mild symptoms of mental stress and to aid sleep [158] . 34 2.7.2 Phytochemistry Valerian root contains many different natural substances, the most important of which are [103] : Mono - and sesquiterpen es: the essential oil is composed of mono - and sesquiterpenes, with the content varying based to the origin (0.3 -2.1%; according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) at least 0.3% for the cut drug). A total of about 160 components have been identified to date, with bornyl acetate being predominant, among others. Other important and expr essed as valerenic acid (Table 6); according to Ph. Eur. not less than 0.10% in cut drug) Valepotriate s: 0.1-0.2% with valtrate (Table 6) and isovaltrate as main components. These are very unstable, and are thermo -, alkali - and acid -labile . In aqueous or ethanolic extracts only t heir degradation products occur which are , baldrinal, homobaldrinal, valeric and isovaleric acids amino -hesperidin, and linarin in small amounts Table Physicochemical characteristics of valerenic acid and valtrate [111] .

Of the pharmacological studies, the following ones should be highlighted [82, 103] : Valerenic acids have muscle relaxant, spasmolytic, and CNS depressant effects since t hey inhibit the degradation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the CNS [159] . The water -soluble lignans are discussed as the main active ingredient responsible for the sedative effect. The lignan olivil is a partial agonist of adenosine A1 receptors with a high affinity, thereby lowering the postsynaptic potential of neurons in the brain [160-162]. The agonistic activity at the adenosine A1 receptor is likely to be largely responsible for the sleep -inducing effect of alcohol -aqueous valerian extracts . Among the flavonoids, there are some candidates with activity on the CNS, such as 6 -methylapigenin which is a benzodiazepine binding site ligand of the GABA receptor and was found to have anxiolytic properties [163] , 2S-hesperidin and linarin which activities (mechanism unknown) [164, 165] . However, due to their low bioavailability, flavones play most likely a minor role in the sedative component . Nevertheless is the effectiveness of valerian preparations less due to individual substances than to synergistic effects, i.e. to a combined action of all ingredients [103] . 2.7.4 Clinical evidence in the treatment of mild mental disorders The following effects of valerian preparations have been proven by a growing number of clinical studies: Improvement of sleep quality [166, 167] with decreasing the amount of time it takes to fall asleep, reduction of nocturnal awakenings [168-170]; improvement in daytime well -being (after 2 - 3 weeks of therapy ) [82]; decrease d central hyperactivity [82]; and reduction of anxiety (see [171] for further references) . A seven week treatment of a valerian and lemon balm combination resulted in e nhancement of concentration , hyperactivity, and impulsiveness in an observational study in primary school children [172] . Additional clinical trials have been conducted on a combination of a valerian and hops extract where a randomized, placebo -controlled trial against diphenhydramine [173] [174] conclude that the valerian -hops combination has a modest hypnotic effect compared to placebo and significantly reduces sleep latency, respectively. The valerian -hops combination also resulted in sleep -inducing effects pregnancy Safet y Valerian preparations are among the most commonly used medications during pregnancy [176] as shown in a data analysis from the Swedish Birth Register from 1995 to 2001 (n=860'215 women). No adverse effects on pregnancy outcome have been reported [177] . In vivo , there were conflicting results: On one hand, it was reported that chromosomal aberrations, spermatozoa abnormalities, and depletion of nucleic acids in testicular cells occurred in mice after 7 days of oral administration of valerian [178] . Moreover, the offspring of female mice treated with high doses (1.2g/kg) of valerian extract had lower levels of zinc in the fetal brain, while the other parameters (weight, volume of cerebral cortex, copper brain tissue content) remained unchanged [179] . On the other hand, treatment of rats be tween the 8th and 15th day of gestation with ethanolic valerian extract did not cause abnormalities in either dams or their offspring [180] . Recommendations for clinical practice European Medicines Agency The HMPC of the EMA does not recommend the use of valerian during pregnancy and lactation due to the absence of sufficient data and not yet established safety profile [158] . Embryotox The Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology (at the Hospital Charit\u00e9 in Berlin) classifies valerian as a \"drug\" for which there are conflicting or still insufficient study data. Therefore, they recommend that the use of valerian for restlessness and nervousness -induced insomnia is acceptable during pregnancy. However, attention should be paid t o the use of non -alcoholic preparations. For a short -time therapy of sleep disorders they suggest diphenhydramin or doxylamin f\u00fcr perinatale Pharmakologie Practical experience, including from surveys on the use of herbal products in pregnancy, speaks in favor of the use in pregnancy, where so far no adverse effect of valerian preparations on mother and child could be found. Aqueous extracts (as ready -to-use medicinal products or as tea) of valerian root are generally suitable for daytime sedation or sleep induction (onset of action usually after one month); ethanolic extracts are suitable as daytime sedatives for anxiety states . The dosage instructions should be followed [182] . 37 2.8 Lavender Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Figure 10) belongs to the family of Lamiaceae and is also known as English lavender, garden lavender or true lavender [183] . It grows to a subshrub (approximately 0.5 -1 m tall) with narrow, lance -shaped leaves. The deep blue -grey flowers are stripped from the long stem just before blossoming, dried and thus can be used as a drug. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region where it is also cultivated in a larger scale and imports of the drug are mainly from France, Spain, and Eastern Europe. Laven der has an intense, pleasant aromatic -scented odor, which is why it is found not only as a phytopharmaceutical but also as a massage and bath oil or in scented soaps [103] . The botanical name comes from the Latin word lavare (to wash) and refers to the time of the Romans, who used the lavender flowers as refreshing bath additive. Angustifolia derives from the angustus (Latin for s mall) and refers to the narrow leaves of the plant [184] . Figure 10. Dionisvera/Shutterstock [185] 2.8.1 Historical use The earliest writings mentioning lavender are by the Greek scholar Theophrastus (370 - 285 BC), and it is known that in ancient Greece, Persia, and Rome lavender was used as a perfume for baths and linens and an antiseptic. The ancient Egyptians made mummif ication casts by soaking linen in asphalted lavender oil. However, lavender did not become an important medicinal plant until around 77 AD when Dioscorides discovered its presence, describing laxative and refreshing properties. The Roman physician and phil osopher Galen (129 -199 AD) used lavender as an antidote for poisoning and insect bites. In the writings of Pliny the Elder, the Roman naturalist and philosopher, lavender was used to treat sadness, among other things. In the 11th century, Benedictine monks brought lavender across the Alps to the monastery gardens of northern Europe, and thus the first mention of the species Lavandula angustifolia comes from Hildegard of Bingen. In Tibetan Buddhist medicine, lavender is used to treat insanity and psychosis [183, 186] . 38 Overall, lavender essential oil has a long history of folk and traditional therapeutic use, so it is also credited with numerous properties: antibacterial, antidepressant, antifungal, antispasmodic, carminative (promotes the elimination of flatulence), wound -healing, and balancing and calming, with the latter playing a major role today [187] . Today, lavender is widely used in Europe and America as an anxiolytic and sleep aid. The EMA also lists \"relief of mild symptoms of mental stress and exhaustion\" as an indication in the Community Herbal Monograph of lavender [188] . 2.8.2 Phytochemistry Lavandula angustifolia Mill. is composed of more than 100 constituents, the most important of which are [103] : 1-3% essential oil (Lavandulae aetheroleum ): main components are R -(-)-linalyl acetate (30 - 50 %; Ph. Eur.: Spectrometry (GC/MS ) analysis revealed that lavender oil contains 26 constituents, of which linalool (26.1%) and linalyl acetate (26.3%) are of linalool [111] . Study compounds Linalool Chemical structure Empirical formula C10 H18 O Molecular weight (g/mol) 154.25 Hydrogen -Donors 1 Hydrogen -Acceptors 1 Rotatable bonds 4 Rings 0 Lipinski violations 0 Solubility in water (mg/mL, 25\u00b0C) essential oil is known for a wide range of biological effects [190, 191] , the most important of which are the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects , and it is very active at low concentrations in several rodent behavioral models typically used to test the latter two properties [192-195]. In animal studies, linalool has been identified as the main pha rmacologically active constituent involved in the antianxiety effects of lavender oil [189] . In addition, linalool has been shown to have neurochemical effects in mice due to a dose -dependent inhibition of glutamate (primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS) binding, and it has been suggested that a potentiation of the neurotransmitter GABA may lead to the hypnotic and anticonvulsant effects of lavender [196] . However, it is important to note that many receptor systems (GABAergic and glutamatergic) as well as several neurotransmitter transporters were only affected by unrealistically high concentrations of lavender oil which are not in agreemen t with the low effective doses, plasma and tissue levels of lavender oil [197, 198] . Therefore, data on the possible mechanism of action are still inconclusive and often controversial. In a certain analogy to the anxiolytic pregabalin, lavender oil was found to have a moderate i nhibition of presynaptic voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC), but without serving the same target as pregabalin (lavender oil: mainly T -type and N -type channels and to some extent channels, pregabalin: mainly P/Q analogy to cl assical antidepressants, lavender oil improves several aspects of neuroplasticity, through activation of intracellular signaling kinases such as protein kinase A ( MAPK ), which in turn leads to activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element -binding protein ( CREB ) [197, 199] . 2.8.4 Clinical evidence in the treatment of mild mental disorders Lavender has been shown to be effective in the treatment of anxiety, according to a recently published systematic review [200] . The anxiolytic effect w as superior to placebo [201] and comparable to that of a benzodiazepine [202] and the SSRI paroxetine [203] ) in adults with generalized anxiety disorder, and fewer adverse effects were reported than with the synthetic drugs. Another randomized, double -blind trial in patients with anxiety -related restlessness and disturbed sleep confirmed the calming a nd anxiolytic efficacy of lavender essential oil [204] . Furthermore, a double -blind, randomized study with 212 patients observed that lavender exerts a secondary sleep -promoting effect through its anxiolytic action, which is not per se mediated by sedation [205] . Hence several clinical trials proved good effectiveness and tolerability of lavender as a phytopharmaceutical, predominantly in the treatment of anxiety. In addition, lavender tea has also been shown to have a positive therapeutic effect on depressed patients, as the effects of the antidepressant citalopram was enhanced in a study including 80 patients with major depression 40 [206] . In a randomized placebo -controlled trial, lavender cream was effective in reducing anxiety, stress and depression [207] . 2.8.5 In pregnancy Safety In a double -blind randomized placebo -controlled trial with 141 pregnant women at 25 to 28 week gestation, the effectiveness of lavender cream with and without footbath was investigated, however, without focusing on the safety [207] . In aromatherapy, lavender essence is safe and effective for pain reduction after cesarean section [208] or episiotomy [209] . Consumption is often labeled as contraindicated during pregnancy due to its emmenagogue (stimulating blood flow ) potential [93, 210] . Recommendations for clinical practice European Medicines Agency The HMPC of the EMA does not recommend the use of lavender during pregnancy and lactation due to the absence of sufficient data and not yet established safety profile [188] Humulus lupulus L., Cannabaceae , Figure 11) belongs to the Cannabaceae family of flowering plants . The dioecious, perennial, herbaceous climbing plant grows 3 -6 m high, in cultivation up to over 10 m, and is grown in many countries of the temperate climate zone . The drugs consist of the dried female cone -shaped fruits (hop cones) or of their glands . The hop cones are greenish -yellow in color, have a strong spicy odor and a somewhat bitter taste . They are surrounded by partially overlapp ing scales (bracts and bracteoles ) and reach maturity at the end of summer or beginning of autumn where they can be harvested. Inside these scales are the oil glands, which form an orange -yellow resinous powder which constitute lupulin. It also tastes bitt er and contains numerous compounds that are of great economic interest, especially for the beer brewing industry. For this reason, only female hop plants are being cultivated [103, 211] . The origin of the genus name Humulus is in the Latinized version of 'chmele' (Slavic language for hop) . The species name lupulus , on the other hand, is a diminutive of lupus (Latin for wolf) and is based on the strangulating growth of the wild plant in behavior towards other plants, which has been compared to the destructive behavior of wolves towards sheep The common name hops is derived from the Anglo -Saxon 'hoppan' (to climb) [212] . Figure Photo source: New Africa/Shutterstock [213] 2.9.1 Historical use Hops was fir st used already around 1000 AD for brewing purposes whereby originally because of its antimicrobial effect as a preservative and only later to give the beer a bitter taste [214] . Only much later did the plant also become appreciated for its medicinal properties. Paracelsus used hops as a digestive aid, and Matthiolus (1501 -1577), an Italian physician, medical writer, and bo tanist, mentioned its diuretic and bile -promoting effects. At the same time, young hop shoots were also used to purify blood, liver, and spleen. In 1814, strongly tonic properties as a bittering agent (amarum) and calming properties were attributed to hop flowers [212] . Hops have only been used as a sedative and sleep aid since the 19th century, when it was observed that hop pickers tired easily, 42 presumably because the hop resin from their hands accidentally transferred t o their mouths [215] . In 1953, it was shown that hops contain an equivalent of 20 -300 \u00b5g estradiol/g, as a folk legend reported menstrual -stimulant properties of hops. Later in 1973, it is claimed that hops can be also used to treat various gynecological diseases [216] . Nowadays, the HMPC of the EMA reports the traditional use of hops to relieve mild symptoms of mental stress and to aid sl eep [217] . According to the German Commissio n E Monograph [218] hops can be used to treat \"mood disturbances such as restlessness and anxiety, sleep disturbances \". It is also externally used for the treatment of ulcers and skin injuries. In Bavaria, the hop cushion is used for calming and for sleep disorders [103] . 2.9.2 Phytochemistry The bitter acids, volatile essential oil, and the polyphenols are the most important constituents of hops [211] . The bitter principles consist mainly of phloroglucinol derivatives which are found in hop cones (15 -30%) and hop glands (50 -80%) and are known as -acids (humulone s, Table 8) and -acids (lupulone s). Analytical data reported a content of 2 -12% of -acids in hops cones, with humulone as the major compound (35% to 70%). 2-Methyl -3-buten -2-ol is a degradation product of these bitter acids and is therefore found only in hop cones that have been stored for a longer period, with a maximum content of about 0.15% of the dry weight [103, 214, 215, 219, 220] .

The plant is also increasingly mentioned in connection with the metabolic syndrome, as some constituents have obesity - and diabetes -related activities. For example, xanthohumol and iso--acids can improve health by affecting lipid metabolism, glucose tolerance, and body weight, which is promising in terms of metabolic syndrome treatment [224-226]. Various hop constituents such as essential oils or hop resins can modulate specific neurotransmitter receptors which is the underlying principle of their sedative, tranquilizing or other neuropharmacological effects: Hops extracts reportedly activate melatonin receptors in vivo [227, 228] and binding affinities to melatonin and serotonin receptors could be as well demonstrated in vitro [229] , which may explain, at least in part, the sleep -inducing properties. Zanoli et al. studied the properties of - and -bitter acids and showed that they, as well as commercial extracts used for beer productio n, affect the CNS of rats [230] and h umulone was found to act as a positive allosteric modulator of recombinant GABA A receptors expressed in HEK -293 cells [231] . 2.9.4 Clinical evidence in the treatment of mild mental disorders Various phytomedicines and food supplements containing hops are available in the EU [232] and in Switzerland. However, in Switzerland these products always c ontain additional plant extracts such as valerian, lemon balm and/or passionflower , and the content in bitter acids is not specified [61]. Until recently, preparation s consisting of a fixed valerian -hops combination represented the most frequently administered form of plant -based sleeping agents and sedatives [167, 175] . The clinical support for the efficacy of hops as a sedative is therefore only based on studies with the mentioned combination with valerian (Ze 91019): Schellenberg et al. showed that Ze 91019 has an influen ce on the CNS within one hour after administration , which was recorded by EEG responses 44 in 16 healthy volunteers . The patients showed an increase in alpha -1 power, which is a wavelength that indicates relaxation. This also reduced beta -2 power, which indic ates increased alertness and mental activity [161] . In a randomized, placebo -controlled , parallel -group clinical trial involving 184 enrolled subjects with mild insomnia, Ze 91019 (and diphenhydramine) was shown to be safe and did not cause recurrence of insomnia when the medication was discontinued. In addition, improveme nt in sleep was associated with improved quality of life [173] . In another randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study, 30 patients with non -organic insomnia were administered either Ze 91019, placebo, or valerian alone for 4 weeks. Polysomnographic reco rdings showed that sleep latency (time between turning off the light and reaching sleep phase 2) was significantly reduced by the addition of hops. In terms of safety, there were no adverse events in any of the three groups [174] . 2.9.5 In pregnancy Safety No clinical or in vivo data are available on the safety of hops preparations in pregnancy . Recommendations for clinical practice European Medicines Agency The HMPC of the EMA does not recommend the use of hops during pregnancy and lactation due to the absence of sufficient data , not yet established safety profile , and no fertility data available Dawes M and Thieme .

Most medications for MDS may not only cause side-effects in the mother, but also easilycross the placental barrier and reach the foetus. Concerns ontolerability, teratogenicity and impact on neonatal outcomes exist(Sivojelezova et al., 2005 ;Rahimi et al., 2006 ;Grigoriadis et al., 2014 ;Yonkers et al., 2017 ;Gao et al., 2018 ). Pregnant women in need of such medications therefore face a dilemma between usingand refraining from synthetic medications. It is therefore understandable that a considerable proportion of women suffering from mild MDS opt for treatment with herbalmedicines, which tend to be perceived as safe ( Kalder et al., 2011 ; Pallivalappila et al., 2013 ). For instance in Germany, approximately one- fth of the pregnant women who take herbal medications do it for psychological problems ( Munstedt et al., 2013 ). Even though the toxicity of herbal medications taken during pregnancy has not in most cases been thoroughlyinvestigated, a considerable proportion of health careprofessionals who deal with pregnant women -midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, and especially those with their ownexperiences -recommend herbal medicine ( Stewart et al., 2014 ). In Switzerland, 40.6% of pregnant women reported using herbalmedicine during pregnancy, which was higher than the average proportion detected in a multinational study [average 28.0% (Kennedy et al., 2013 )]. Our main purpose was to compare the use of herbal medicines in women with and without MDS. Further goals were tocharacterise the use, perceived effectiveness and tolerability ofa few candidate herbal medicines for mild MDS treatment. METHODS Study Design The present analysis is based on self-reported data from obstetric patients participating in a cross-sectional survey undertaken between August 2018 and March 2019. Ethics Statement The study was conducted in accordance with the HelsinkiDeclaration and with Swiss laws and regulations. Incompliance with Swiss Federal Law on data protection(Human Research Act, Article 2), since the data wereanonymously collected, no special authorisation was needed.This was con rmed by jurisdictional declaration of the ethics committee of Zurich (Enquire BASEC-Nr. Req-2017-00966; letter from December 14, 2017). Selection and Description of Participants The survey took place in the Canton of Zurich -often considered to be representative of the Swiss population as a whole -whose inhabitants correspond to one-sixth of the entire Swisspopulation. Eight obstetric clinics and birth centres agreed toparticipate. In these institutions, pregnant women (at or after28 weeks of pregnancy) or women in the puerperium were invitedto participate in the survey if they had not previously completed the questionnaire, could read German, English, French or Italian, and were not emergency patients. The aim of our survey was to compare the use of herbal medicines during pregnancy in women with and without MDS.Assuming that twice as many pregnant women take herbalmedicines for symptoms related to physical conditions thanfor symptoms related to mental diseases [40 and 20%,respectively, compare with Munstedt et al. (2013) ], a sample size of 106 in each group would allow the detection of a differenceTABLE 1 | Herbs mentioned in the questionnaire by common names and corresponding full taxonomical names.

Herbal Medicines in Pregnancybetween the percentage of women taking herbal medicines in the groups with and without MDS. The survey was pursued until 106women taking (pharmaceutical) herbal medicines in each of thegroups with and without MDS had participated. Questionnaire The questionnaire consisted of 21 multiple-choice questions andwas available in German, English, French and Italian. Piloting ofthe questionnaire -distributed to 14 women, at least three per language -was conducted to ensure readability and clarity of the questions. Four of the 21 (complex) questions were related to the intake of herbal medicines during pregnancy and were inspired by aprevious survey ( Zuzak et al., 2009 ). The questionnaire distinguished between herbal infusions/teas and pharmaceutical herbal medicines, but did not specify the type of preparation. For a selection of six herbs, detailed informationon perceived effectiveness and tolerability was collected. In thequestionnaire, the common names of the herbs were used, with afew exceptions (see Table 1 , also for the correspondence between the used names and full taxonomic names). To contextualise our results, data on sociodemographic characteristics, acute/chronic disorders and symptoms andsynthetic/conventional medications were collected [in partpublished elsewhere ( Randecker et al., 2020 )]. To avoid counting missing answers as \"non-use \"answers, the questions on medicinal herbal medicines included the option \"never used \"; in these cases, the number of total answers differs from questionto question. We de ned an existing MDS on the basis of speci c questions. If the women reported suffering from acute or chronic mentaldisorder, or related symptoms, or reported taking psychotropicdrugs, they were considered to have MDS. No MDS severityassessment was performed; psychotic diseases were not addressedin the questionnaire. Data Collection A total of 1,653 envelopes -each one containing an information sheet, the questionnaire and a post-paid envelope addressed tothe Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zurich -were handed out to potential participants in obstetric clinics and birthcentres in the Canton of Zurich. Professionals were instructed bythe study team to distribute the envelopes to patients duringprenatal check-ups or during hospitalisation in the earlypuerperium. Sealing of the envelopes after insertion of thecompleted questionnaires was emphasised to the patients toensure anonymity. Data were entered manually into aMicrosoft Excel le. Statistical Data Analysis Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 25.0.for Windows (IBM\u00aeSPSS\u00aeStatistics). Pearson 's chi-square test was used to compare use of herbal medicines betweenparticipants with and without MDS, and MDS prevalencebetween herbal medicines users and non-users. A two-sidedp-value smaller than 0.05 was considered statisticallysignicant; no correction for multiple testing was applied. The number of missing answers is depicted either in the tables orcorresponding legends. RESULTS Number and Sociodemographic and Health-Related Characteristics ofParticipants From a total of 1,653 questionnaires distributed, 398 were completed at or after 28 week 's gestation or shortly after birth and returned either by post or through collection boxes placed inthe various institutions (overall response rate: 398/1,653, 24.1%). The 398 participants were treated at the following institutions: University Hospital Zurich ( n/equals164), some institutions ( n/equals10), more than one institution ( n/equals10) or none were named ( n/equals3). Most women completed the questionnaires in German (362/ 398, 91.0%), followed by English (28/398, 7.0%), French (3/398, 0.8%). The survey population wascomprised mainly of women between 18 and 43 years, with a medium to high level of education (high school to university). The majority of women were from Switzerland (202/398, 50.8%),followed by Germany The majority of participants had deliveredin the days before receiving the questionnaire (221/371, 59.6%);the remaining women were either in pregnancy weeks 28 -37 (79/ 371, 21.3%) data, see Supplementary Table S1 . About a quarter of women reported chronic disorders (101/ 373, 27.1%), of S2 The following pregnancy-related acute disorders were the most common:18.6% of women (69/371) reported suffering fromgastroesophageal re flux, 17.0% (63/371) from iron de ciency/ anemia, and 14.3% (53/371) from morning sickness. The mostcommonly reported symptoms fatigue(294/370, 79.5%), (191/359, 53.2%). For additional information on disorders and symptoms during pregnancy, see Supplementary Tables S2, S3 , respectively. MDS During Pregnancy Four percent of the women (15/372) reported one of the following chronic mental disorders: minor depression ( n/equals5); mood disorder (n/equals5); anxiety disorder ( n/equals1) and sleeping disorder ( n/equals1). Moreover, a prevalence of acute mental disorders during pregnancy of 13.2% (48/371) was observed, which Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 729724 3Gantner et al. Herbal Medicines in Pregnancyincluded sleeping disorder n/equals27); mood disorder ( disorder (Supplementary Table S2 ). More than half (51.3%) of the participants reportedhaving suffered from a mental symptom during pregnancy (204/ 398), 9.9%). Compared with the pre-pregnancy period, the prevalence of anxiety and insomnia was higher, whereas the prevalence of depressive mood was slightly lower during pregnancy ( Supplementary Table S3 ).Figure 1A provides an overview of the prevalence of mental symptoms duringand before pregnancy. Only a few participants used antidepressants (5/315, 1.6%) and none used Table sedatives/anxiolytics was markedly higher (19/321 and or4.8%, respectively). Two women (2/240; 0.8%) answered that theywere taking an antidepressant not mentioned in the questionnaire during pregnancy, namely escitalopram ( n/equals1) and paroxetine (SSRIs); additional other sedatives/anxiolytics were not mentioned. Use of Herbal Medicines in General and Versus MDS The vast majority of women reported using some type of herbal medications, either as teas or as pharmaceutic/clinical medicines,during pregnancy (358/398, 89.9%). Of these, 272 participants(272/325, 83.7%) used pharmaceutical herbal products, most frequently ginger (49.2%), raspberry leaf (42.7%), bryophyllum (37.8%), chamomile iron-richherbs . The majority of participants (263/ 358, 86.5%) who reported using herbal medicines duringpregnancy, also used herbal medicines before the currentpregnancy. The consumption of teas was very widespread inour study population ( Table 3 ). The percentage of use of pharmaceutical herbal medicines was higher among women reporting MDS than among the remainingwomen Almost 60% of the women who used pharmaceutical herbal medicines suffered from MDS (162/272, 59.6%), which is signicantly higher than the corresponding value for non-users (18/53, 34.0%; p/equals0.001). More than half of the women who used any type of herbal preparation, teas and pharmaceutical herbalmedicines, reported MDS (192/358, 53.6%). Figure 2 shows the most frequently used herbal medicines, pharmaceutical herbalmedicines and teas counted together. Several differencesbetween the groups with and without MDS are apparent.Pregnant women with MDS also more often reported usingmedicines from integrative and complementary medicine thanwomen without ( Table 4 ). Effectiveness and Tolerability of Candidate Herbal Medicines for MDS Treatment Some questions on the questionnaire speci cally targeted the use of well-known plants for the treatment of mild MDS, namely St.John 's wort, hops, valerian, lavender, and bryophyllum. St. John 's wort was taken by 3.5% of women who answered the corresponding questions (12/341), in half of the cases during FIGURE 1 | Perceived mental symptoms (A)and reported use of antidepressants (B)and sedatives/anxiolytics (C)during pregnancy and in the time before.

Three women reported good to very good tolerability ( Figure 3 ) and moderate to good effectiveness. St. John 's wort was mostly taken for the treatment of mood disorders (4/12, 33.3%). Hops was used by 2.3% of women (8/343), in all phases of pregnancy. Hops was tolerated well: three of eight women reportedvery good tolerability and one of eight reported poor tolerability. Seven of eight women evaluated its effectiveness as very good. Thetwo most frequently reported indications were stress and restlessness(both 3/8, 37.5%), followed by sleep disorders (2/8, 25.0%). Valerian was used most frequently in the last trimester (7/20, 35.0%). Overall, 20 women reported using valerian (20/344,TABLE 2 | Use of pharmaceutical herbal medicines during pregnancy by participants with and without mental disorders and/or symptoms (MDS).

As shown in Figure 4 , half of the participants rated its effectiveness as very good (10/20, 50.0%). Valerian was usedmost 45.0%), andrestlessness (8/20, 40.0%). The use of lavender was also increased toward the end of pregnancy. Lavender was used by 16.2% of women (56/345) and11 of 56 women rated its tolerability as very good. Its effectivenesswas described as good to very good by almost half of the womenwho used it (26/56, 46.4%), but bad by 35.7% of women (20/56). Lavender was used mostly to combat (19/56, 33.9%) and stress (15/56, 26.8%). Bryophyllum was used during pregnancy by almost one-third of the participants (107/360, 29.7%). Of these, more than three- quarters used it during pregnancy weeks 28 -42 (84/107, 78.5%). Only a few women (3/107) reported poor tolerability. Regardingthe effectiveness of bryophyllum, 58.8% of women rated it good tovery good (63/107, all indications together; comparablepercentages in the main single indications; see Figure 4) . Restlessness was mentioned as a main indication by bryophyllum forsleep disorders. Sixty-six percent of the women who had used FIGURE 2 | Comparison of the most frequently used herbal medicines (pharmaceutical products and teas) in women with and without mentaldisorders and/or symptoms (MDS).

In addition, some women reported using bryophyllumfor uterus soothing ( n/equals3), against abdominal cramps/pain ( n/equals 3), against ( n/equals1) and against cervix shortening ( n/equals1). DISCUSSION Main Findings In our study population, the majority of women made use of herbal medicines, including pharmaceutical herbal products andteas. A wide variety of herbal products were mentioned by thesurvey participants, but ginger, raspberry leaf, bryophyllum,chamomile, lavender and iron-rich herbs were most commonly used. Our data further show that more than half (52.0%) of all participants had MDS during pregnancy, althoughfew made use of (synthetic) psychoactive medications. Theprevalence of MDS was higher among users of pharmaceuticalherbal medicines than among non-users. Focusing on the mostcommonly used herbal medicines, users of bryophyllum andlavender reported suffering from MDS particularly often.Speci c questions about candidate herbal medicines for the treatment of MDS revealed that bryophyllum (mentioned by107 women), lavender (56 women) and valerian (20 women) were used to reduce stress, restlessness, sleep disorders and others,frequently with perceived good to very good effectiveness andtolerability. Strengths and Limitations All data were self-reported. While the number of pregnantparticipants ( n/equals398) can be considered a strength of the present survey, the moderate response rate of 24.1% is alimitation of the study. To avoid selections biases, followingmeasures were taken: 1) all hospitals from the Canton ofZurich with an obstetrics ward were invited to participate; 2)the institutions that agreed to participate were regularly remindedof the survey; 3) the questionnaires were available in fourlanguages (the three main country languages and English); 4)mental conditions were not mentioned in the title or cover letterof the questionnaire; 5) it was clearly stated that the survey was fully anonymous. Nevertheless, some selection bias due to interest in herbal medicines (mentioned in the title and cover letter) or thelimited number of available questionnaire languages cannot beexcluded. In the case of patients from the University HospitalZurich (41.2% of survey participants), an internal analysis of themain patient demographic data revealed comparablecharacteristics to those of the survey participants (ownunpublished observations). Finally, most questionnaires werehanded over to women after delivery. While this can be FIGURE 4 | Experiences with candidate herbal medicines for the treatment of mental disorders and/or symptoms (MDS) during pregnancy regarding their effectiveness. Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 729724 7Gantner et al. Herbal Medicines in Pregnancyconsidered a strength -as postpartum women are able to describe their use of herbal medicines throughout the whole pregnancy -it is conceivable that some participants may not have rememberedthe medicines taken at the beginning of pregnancy. Use of Pharmaceutic Herbal Medicines During Pregnancy The high use of herbal medicines observed in the present survey is consistent with ndings of a previous pilot survey conducted in a comparable population in the late 1990s ( Gut et al., 2004 ). Studies from other countries reported lower use, and a multinationalstudy of the use of herbal medications in pregnancy in 23countries, and involving 9,459 women, revealed a markedlylower rate [28.9% of the women ( Kennedy et al., 2013 )]. This could be related to different perceptions of \"herbal medicines \" among participants in the different studies. In general, women inour study seemed to be more likely to use herbal medicines if theywere primiparous and had used herbal medicines in the past/before pregnancy (data not shown). This could also be seen in anAustralian study ( Low Dog, 2009 ), where the most commonly used herbals were ginger, cranberry, valerian, raspberry,chamomile and peppermint ( Kennedy et al., 2013 ), which is similar to our results. In the following, we will focus on the herbal medicines used by at least 20% of the participants, rst with respect to frequency of use during pregnancy and effectiveness, then summarising what is known on their safety. Our nding that ginger was the most commonly used herbal medicine con rms the results of previous surveys, and corresponds well with the high prevalence of nauseaduring pregnancy found in our survey (67.9%). Ginger can beconsidered a possibly effective treatment for nausea and vomitingduring pregnancy ( Viljoen et al., 2014 ). Raspberry leaf was the second most commonly used herbal medicine among pregnantwomen in our study, in accordance with studies showing that it isoften recommended by midwives ( Allaire et al., 2000 ;Holst et al., 2009 ). It is used to strengthen or prepare the uterus, to soften the cervix, and to induce and shorten labor ( Briggs et al., 2022 ). In a placebo-controlled randomized trial, raspberry leaf tablets didnot shorten the rst stage of labor, but resulted in a small shortening of the second stage and less forceps deliveries(Simpson et al., 2001 ). Bryophyllum was the third most commonly used herbal medicine. Because this plant isrecommended in several perinatal centres in Switzerland forthe treatment of anxiety states, restlessness, and sleepdisturbances ( Schenkel et al., 2018 ), the questionnaire contained additional questions about its use (see below).Nevertheless, most women used bryophyllum for the treatment of other disorders, often related to the attenuation of uterine contractions. In anthroposophic medicine,bryophyllum was introduced in the 1970s as a well-toleratedagent for the treatment of preterm labor ( F\u00fcrer et al., 2016 ; Hamburger et al., 2017 ); in Switzerland it is recommended for this indication ( Schenkel et al., 2018 ) and commonly used in the main perinatal institutions ( F\u00fcrer et al., 2015 ). Chamomile, the fourth most commonly used medicine has been also widely usedand is known as a treatment for nausea and vomiting duringpregnancy ( Sanaati et al., 2016 ). Finally, lavender was frequently used (see below for information on its anxiolytic effects). The Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) does not recommend the use of ginger ( European Medicines Agency, 2012b ), raspberry leaf ( European Medicines Agency, 2014 ), chamomile ( European Medicines Agency, 2015 )a n d lavender ( European Medicines Agency, 2012a )d u r i n g pregnancy because of insuf cient safety data; so far, no community herbal monograph was published onbryophyllum. According to a reference work on drugs inpregnancy ( Briggs et al., 2022 ), ginger and raspberry leaf are classi ed as compatible with pregnancy, whereas about chamomile it is considered that human data are limited and norelevant human data are available. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2014, ginger can be considered a harmless treatment for nausea and vomiting duringpregnancy: here no signi cant differences were found between the ginger and placebo treated groups for allreported adverse effects in various studies ( Viljoen et al., 2014 ). A systematic review come to comparable conclusions (Stanisiere et al., 2018 ). With respect to raspberry leaf use, an unclear association with caesarean sections ( Nordeng et al., 2011 ) and an interaction with a conventional medicine (hypoglycaemia when used with insulin) have been reported(Cheang et al., 2016 ). A randomized trial, however, revealed no adverse effects for mother or child ( Simpson et al., 2001 ). Several retrospective and prospective studies on the use ofbryophyllum during pregnancy are indicative of a good safetyprole (Lambrigger-Steiner et al., 2014 ;F\u00fcrer et al., 2015 ; F\u00fcrer et al., 2016 ;Hamburger et al., 2017 ;Sim\u00f5es-W\u00fcst et al., 2018 ). A qualitative study pointed towards an association between regular use of chamomile duringpregnancy and a higher incidence of threateningmiscarriages and preterm labor [without correction forpossible confounders; Cuzzolin et al. (2010) ]. Herbal Medicines and MDS Treatment Of the herbal medicines speci cally addressed in the present questionnaire, there were several that -irrespective of pregnancy -are used in the treatment of mild MDS. Evidence for their use during pregnancy is still scarce, therefore the existingstudies are brie fly discussed below (on the herbal medicines used by at least 20 participants). Valerian was mostly used to treat restlessness and sleep disorders. As a sleep-aid, its bene ts and side effect pro le have been shown in several studies ( Dorn, 2000 ;Andreatini et al., 2002 ;Hattesohl et al., 2008 ). In a small survey conducted in southern Italy, no in fluence of valerian use on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes was found ( n/equals9) (Low Dog, 2009 ). Data from the Swedish Birth Register from 1995 to 2004 also suggest good safety, as no abnormalities were found in theinfants of mothers who had taken phytotherapeutics -often valerian -during pregnancy ( n/equals787, 0.9% of all mothers in the register). In our study, women reported using lavender more often during the last trimester of pregnancy, mainly against Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 729724 8Gantner et al. Herbal Medicines in Pregnancyrestlessness, sleep disorders and stress. Several clinical trials revealed good ef cacy and tolerability of a medicine prepared from lavender flowers in the treatment of anxiety ( Kasper et al., 2010 ;Woelk and Schlafke, 2010 ;Kasper et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, lavender tea has been shown to enhance the effects of the antidepressant citalopram ( Nikfarjam et al., 2013 ). We are aware of only one previous study during pregnancy: in a randomised placebo-controlled trial, lavendercream was shown to reduce anxiety, stress and depression ( Effati- Daryani et al., 2015 ). Although most participants used bryophyllum to treat indications other than MDS, this plant was also used to treatrestlessness, stress, sleep disorders, mood disorders, anxiety, anddepression. In anthroposophic medicine, the use of bryophyllummedicines for mental disorders is well documented ( Sim\u00f5es-W\u00fcst et al., 2012 ). Prospective observational studies revealed improvements in sleep quality after treatment withbryophyllum in pregnant women ( Lambrigger-Steiner et al., 2014 ) [and in cancer patients ( Sim\u00f5es-W\u00fcst et al., 2015 )]. The particularly high prevalence of MDS among herbal medicine-users and the rare use of synthetic psychoactivemedications suggest that pregnant women avoid them andprefer recurring to herbal med icines for mild MDS treatment. The reported positive experiences with some candidate herbalmedicines for mild MDS treatment and their well-perceivedtolerability deserve particular attention.

This is particularly relevant in managing non -psychotic mental disorders (NMDs) since treatment with central nervous system -active drugs and untreated NMDs may have negative effects. Some well -known herbal medicines (phytopharmaceuticals), including St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops possess antidepressant, sedative, anxiolytic, or antidepressant properties and cou ld be used to treat mental diseases such as depression, restlessness , and anxiety in pregnancy. Our goal was to assess their safety in vitro, focusing on cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, genotoxicity , and effects on metabolic properties and differenti ation in cells widely used as a placental cell model (BeWo b30 placenta choriocarcinoma cells). The l avender essential oil was inconspicuous in all experiments and showed no detrimental effects. At low -to-high concentrations, no extract markedly affected t he chosen safety parameters. At an artificially high concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL, extracts from St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian , and hops had minimal cytotoxic effects. None of the extracts resulted in genotoxic effects or altered glucose consum ption or lactate production, nor did they induce or inhibit BeWo b30 cell differentiation.

Medicinal Plants CHMP Committee Herbal Medicinal Products CNS central nervous system CPT camptothecin EMA European Medicines such as depression and anxiety disorders, are common is- sues during pregnancy and the postpartum period. A recentprevalence estimate in Switzerland revealed that 17% of womenreceive mental health care during pregnancy and the first post-partum year [1]. For women with pre-existing psychiatric condi- tions, this period is prone to recurrence or even worsening of NMDs. About 10 -13% of fetuses are exposed to a psychotropic drug [2], leading to side effects for both the mother and the fetusor newborn [3]. The most commonly used psychotropic medica-tions include antidepressants, with the use of SSRIs such as citalo-pram being preferred [4]. Exposure to these medications and un-treated depression in pregnancy have been associated with poorbirth outcomes and increased risks, and the treatment of depres- sion in pregnancy remains challenging [5, 6]. Benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam, are used to treat anxiety, sleep, and mooddisorders. However, their use in the weeks before childbirth mayprovoke neonatal withdrawal syndrome, floppy infant syndrome,or various acute toxic effects in the newborn [7]. Since treatingmental diseases during pregnancy with conventional medicationshas several drawbacks, and since an untreated NMD ifself shouldbe avoided, safe herbal preparations may be a treatment option. Several herbal candidates could be considered to treat mild NMDs during pregnancy, namely hops, valerian, lavender, Californiapoppy, and St. John sw o r t . Preparations of hops Caprifoliaceae) have a long history of traditional use for the treatment of sleeping disorders [8]. Anoninterventional study of a combination of hops and valerian im-proved sleep latency and quality in adults with primary insomnia [8]. The combination also led to sleep-improving effects in a ran- domized, placebo-controlled sleep-EEG study [9]. However, diver-gent results have been reported regarding the clinical effective- ness of hop-valerian combinations (for a review, see [10]). In ro- dents, valerian showed anxiolytic and antidepressant-like activity,which may account for the sleep-enhancing effects of valerian[11]. Data from a Swedish birth register from 1995 to 2004 with860215 women show that valerian preparations are among the most frequently used medicines during pregnancy, and no un-favorable effects on pregnancy outcomes were reported [12]. Amultinational study also showed that valerian is among the most frequently used herbal preparations in pregnancy [13]. In a recent retrospective observational study performed in the South of Italy,no influence of valerian ingestion on pregnancy and neonatal out-comes was detected (n = 9) [14]. However, to the best of ourknowledge, no clinical or in vivo data are available on the safety of hops preparations in pregnancy. The essential oil of lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Lamiaceae) is used in various applications and must contain 25 - 46% linalyl acetate and 20 -45% linalool for therapeutic use [15]. It effectively treats anxiety [16], general restlessness, and diffi-culty falling asleep [15]. In adults with generalized anxiety disor-der, the anxiolytic effect was comparable to that of [17] and the SSRI paroxetine California poppy ( Eschscholzia californica Cham., Papaveraceae) is traditionally used to relieve mild symptoms of mental stress and as a sleeping aid [19]. Although herbal products have been on themarket for almost 40 years (since 1982), there are very few clinicalstudies on their efficacy [20]. Anxiolytic and sedative effects havebeen reported in rodents [21], which could be explained by highaffinity to benzodiazepine receptors of yet unknown comp ounds [22]. Various alkaloids have been identified in the aerial parts ofCalifornia poppy but do not seem to bind to GABA Areceptors and thus to modulate chloride currents [23]. Phytomedicines containing St. John sw o r t( Hypericum perfora- tumL., Hypericaceae) are widely used for the treatment of mild to moderate depression [24], nervous unrest, anxiety, and, to someextent, insomnia [15]. A meta-analysis of 27 studies revealed thatthe herbal antidepressant did not differ in efficacy from SSRIs[25]. Treatment of mild-to-moderate depression with St. John s wort extract resulted in fewer adverse events and thus fewer treatment discontinuations [25]. However, several relevant drug interactions with St. John s wort extract must be considered in clinical practice [26]. The potential risk for pregnant women is stillunclear due to the current lack of clinical data and equivocal re-sults in animal studies. Data on the prevalence of fetal malforma-tions in pregnant women exposed to St. John s wort preparations are not extensive. A study using data from the Danish NationalBirth Cohort reported a nonsignificantly higher prevalence of mal- formations (8.1%; 3/38) in the group exposed to St. John sw o r t than in the comparator group (3.3%, 2 891/90 128, p = 0.13).wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops, in con- centrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL, do not possess any cytotoxic orgenotoxic potential and do not compromise placental cell via-bility, metabolic activity, and differentiation. Empirical and clinical studies during pregnancy are needed to support thesein vitro data. 1037Spiess D et al. Medicinal Plants 1036 -1046 | \u00a9 2021. The author(s). However, the difference was based on 3 cases only and did not fol- low a specific pattern [27]. Another prospective study comparedthe rate of major malformations in subjects taking St. John sw o r t (5.3%; 2/38) with pregnant women treated with another healthy women (0%; 0/56). Similarly,the and live births was comparable in all3 groups [28]. A considerable proportion of healthcare professionals who deal with pregnant women daily recommend herbal medications [29]. Pregnant women themselves often turn to phytomedicines [30]and tend to perceive herbal products as safe [31]. However, theCHMP of the EMA does not recommend the use of hops [32],valerian [33], lavender [34], California poppy [19], and St. John s wort [35] during pregnancy because of a lack of sufficient safetydata. Specifically, it is unknown to what extent phytochemicalscross the placenta barrier or interfere with placenta function and, thereby, may interfere with the development of the fetus. Assessing the safety of phytopharmaceuticals is a significant challenge. The active ingredients of herbal extracts are multi-compound mixtures, many of which may be metabolized by theintestinal microbiota upon oral administration or by the liver oncethey have been absorbed. An interdisciplinary project is underwayto fill this gap and address some of these issues, ranging frommetabolizing phytochemicals by intestinal microbiota to intestinal absorption, liver metabolism, and passage across the placental barrier [36]. We performed an in vitro assessment in BeWo cells of the safety profile of medicinal plants that are used to treat mildNMDs. This human choriocarcinoma cell line (clone b30) is awidely used in vitro model for investigating placental metabolism, villous trophoblast fusion, undergo morphological differenti- ation into a layer of syncytiotrophoblasts with the addition of FSK [37]. The formation of a layer of syncytiotrophoblasts and theconcomitant production of -hCG are essential for the function of the human placenta and the preservation of a healthy preg-nancy [37]. We assessed the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of theextracts in BeWo b30 cells, their effects on critical metabolicproperties such as glucose consumption and lactate production,and the ability to induce or inhibit cell differentiation. Results In herbal extracts, defining a concentration range for in vitro test- ing that reflects clinically attainable tissue concentrations is chal-lenging. Maximum daily recommended doses for phytomedicinescontaining St. John s wort, hops, valerian, California poppy, and lavender essential oil range between 80 and 1200 mg/day (high- est value corresponding to maximal dose of Somnofor; see [38]). Assuming a daily dose of 1200 mg extract dissolved in body-water(ca. 30.6 L in 15 -24-year-old women, calculated for an average body weight of 60 kg [39]), an absence of metabolization by theintestinal microbiota, and a 100% bioavailability of all a maximal concentration of 39 \u00b5g/mL of extract wouldbe reached in the body fluid. Based on this calculation, a concen-tration range of 0.03 to 100 \u00b5g/mL was used in the assays, where-by the higher test concentrations were significantly above possi- ble clinically achieved tissue concentrations. First, the effects of the extracts on cell viability and apoptosis induction were assessed via the turnover of WST-1 in viable cells.At concentrations of 30 \u00b5g/mL, all extracts showed no or onlyminimal cytotoxicity after 72 h of incubation, and pr onounced cytotoxic effects for 4 out of 5 extracts were only observed at aconcentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL ( Fig. 1 ). At this concentration, St. John s wort, California poppy, and valerian extracts reduced cell viability by 25 -40% compared to untreated control cells, while hops extract lowered cell viability by 75%. Apoptosis inBeWo b30 cells was assessed via flow cytometric analysis. The ex-tracts of California poppy and lavender did not induce apoptosis atconcentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL ( Fig. 2 ). Extracts of St. John s wort, valerian, and hops only increased apoptotic cell death atthe highest concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL. Diazepam and citalo- pram were also tested for comparison and did not show cytotox- icity in this concentration range ( Fig. 8S , Supporting Information). Possible genotoxicity of extracts was assessed with the aid of the comet assay, whereby a noncy totoxic concentration range (3, 10, and 30 \u00b5g/mL) was tested. None of the extracts induced nota-ble increases in tail DNA, and mostly intact nuclear DNA could bedetected after treatment of the cells with extracts for 3 h( Fig. 3 ). Diazepam and citalopram also showed no genotoxicity in this assay ( Fig. 8S , Supporting Information). In the next step, the effect of the herbal extracts on glucose consumption and lactate production was examined. None of theextracts affected the metabolic activity of viable BeWo b30 cellswhen tested at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL. Glucose and lac-tate concentrations of cell supernatants were not statistically dif-ferent from the untreated control ( Fig. 4 ). Data were normal- ized to the protein content. Without the normalization, valerian extract at a 100 \u00b5g/mL concentration led to a decrease in glucose consumption and concomitant reduction in lactate production(data not shown). Diazepam and citalopram did not lead tochanges in glycolytic metabolism ( Fig. 8S , Supporting Informa- tion). Finally, the impact of the extracts on -hCG secretion was investigated. Upon adding 50 \u00b5M FSK as a positive control, a100-fold incr ease of -hCG levels was observed, which is charac- teristic of differentiation of BeWo b30 cells. In contrast, none of the 5 herbal extracts triggered an increase in -hCG production ( Fig. 5a ). Also, no significant decrease of -hCG levels was ob- served for cells treated with the extracts compared to untreatedcontrol. Only the valerian extract s highest test concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL) led to a slight (nonsignificant) reduction. Only non-toxic extract concentrations were chosen to inhibit placental celldifferentiation by herbal preparations ( 30 \u00b5g/mL). The addition of 5 \u00b5M FSK resulted in 5-fold increased -hCG levels, showing that differentiation of BeWo b30 cells was successful (as shownin Fig. 5b ) even after using 10-fold lower FSK concentrations and cell exposure for 24 h only. A 24 h pre-incubation with any ofthe 5 herbal preparations (in concentrations of 1, 3, 10, and30 \u00b5g/mL) did not have a statistically significant inhibitory effecton FSK-induced placenta cell differentiation ( Fig. 5b ). 1038Spiess D Medicinal 1036 -1046 | \u00a9 2021.

Medicinal Plants Papers Discussion Hydroalcoholic extracts from St. John s wort, California poppy, va- lerian and hops, and lavender essential oil did not induce in vitro cytotoxicity, apoptosis, or genotoxicity in BeWo b30 cells at con-centrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL. Moreover, there were no abnormal-ities in metabolic properties and no impact on cell differentiation.No changes were observed when normalizing the glucose and lac-tate concentrations (mmol) to the amount of protein (mg). Thisindicates that viable cells had a normal glycolytic metabolismunder a 48 h exposure to extract concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/ mL. No significant -hCG release was observed for all extracts, suggesting that they did not induce the cell fusion process. Nosignificant decrease in -hCG supernatant concentrations was seen when BeWo b30 cells were pre-incubated for 24 h with non-cytotoxic concentrations ( 30 \u00b5g/mL) of the extracts. These re- sults showed that the extracts could not inhibit the cell differenti- ation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts. Reduced cell viability and induction of apoptosis were seen at the highest ex-tract concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL, except for lavender essentialoil, which was inconspicuous in all experiments. To summarize,all herbal extracts of St. John s wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops showed no toxicological abnormalities in a rel-evant concentration range. The main strength of this in vitro study is the combination of different and well-recognized assays to assess the safety of com- Fig. 5 Effects of extracts on the production of -hCG in BeWo b30 cells.

Cells were pre-treated with the test compounds (or cell culture me- dium) for 24 h, before adding 5 \u00b5M FSK for another 24 h. 1041Spiess D et al. Medicinal Plants for ...Planta monly used herbal preparations. A wide range of concentrations and various time exposures of up to 3 days were tested using thecell line most frequently used as a cellular model of placenta,which closely reflects the biological environment. The constrainttoin vitro model is, at the same time, a limitation, which is quite difficult to overcome and translate into the clinical situation. Forinstance, intestinal and hepatic metabolism, clearance, allergic re-actions, and pregnancy-related specificities could not be consid- ered. In our study, St. John s wort showed no significant effects at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL in all experiments. The viability as-say and the apoptosis markers showed an impairment of theBeWo b30 cells only at the highest concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL.This is in good agreement with other published in vitro data, where the toxicity of St. John s wort was seen at high concentra- tions ( 150 \u00b5g/mL) [40]. Moreover, no effect on the -hCG pro- duction could be detected at 25 \u00b5g/mL of the extract [40]. Hyper- forin reportedly inhibited the growth of embryonic stem cells andinduced apoptosis in fibroblasts and thus may, at high concentra-tions, pose embryotoxic and teratogenic risks [41]. It s hould be added that the hyperforin content in phytomedicines varieswidely, depending on the specific product [42]. We only found minimal cytotoxic potential for California poppy, as only the viability assay showed a slight significance at 100 \u00b5g/mL. Currently, there is a lack of sufficient clinical data on the safety of California poppy, as preparations have not beentested for reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity.Furthermore, no data on in vitro cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, or in- fluence on glycolytic metabolism and placental cell differentiationcould be found. With our data, we have managed to provide aninsight into in vitro safety that no one has found before to the best of our knowledge. Valerian has been repeatedly discussed regarding a possible genotoxic potential. In a human endothelial cell line, 5 -60 \u00b5g/mL of a dichloromethane extract of valerian show no significant cyto-toxic effects. Discrete DNA damage occurred after in vitro exposure for 48 h to 40 or 60 \u00b5g/mL extract, but not at concentrations40 \u00b5g/mL [43]. Valepotriates were considered responsible for the DNA damage [43]. However, valepotriates are unstable and de-grade during the drying and heating of roots, and the valerian ex- tract used in our study was devoid of valepotriates (see Fig. 1S, Ta- ble 1S , Supporting Information). In vivo , chromosomal aberrations, spermatozoa abnormalities, and a decrease in nucleic acids in tes-ticular cells were reported to occur in mice after 7 days of oral ad-ministration of valerian by gavage (capsules containing 800 mg va-lerian root and 220 mg valerian root dried extract; dosage - 2000 mg/kg/ day) [44]. Valerian showed significant cytotoxic events in our setup for the same assays as St. John s wort but slightly less pronounced. It was also the only extract that had any significant effects on the metabolic properties of the BeWo b30cells before normalizing per amount of protein available (data notshown). Valerian also showed a tendency (nonsignificant) to re-duce -hCG hormone concentrations in cell supernatants, which is most certainly due to cell toxicity and, therefore, decreased cell vi-ability. Nevertheless, in all assays, the effects were only seen for theartificial nonphysiological concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL. No signifi- cant effects could be detected at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL.The essential oil of lavender did not show any impairment of the BeWo b30 cells at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL. Howmuch of the volatile components of the oil were still present atthe end of our experiments (48 -72 h at 37\u00b0C) is unknown and re- quires further clarification. The hops extract affected cell viability and induced apoptosis only at a physiologically irrelevant concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL.Only a few toxicity data on hops (compounds) are available. This is the case of prenylated flavonoids that revealed antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in human cancer cell lines [45]. It must benoted that hop extracts are often combined with valerian or otherextracts, and mono-preparations are not available in Switzerland. Extracts of St. John s wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops do not appear to affect the functionality of placentacells at concentrations that can be expected upon ingestion ofrecommended daily doses of phytomedicines. Only at very high test concentrations, particularly in the case of St. John s wort, a decrease of cell viability and induction of apoptosis was observed.Most importantly, no indications for genotoxic effects and no al-terations in important metabolic parameters or cell differentia-tion were detected.

After 75 min of incuba-tion at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2, a spectrophotometric measurement was taken at 450 nm using a plate reader (Tecan Reader InfiniteM 200). Apoptosis assay To assess the level of apoptosis after application of the test sub-stances, BeWo b30 cells were subjected to the same treatmentdescribed for the WST-1 assay.

Glucose and lactate concentration measurements Cells were seeded into transparent 24-well plates at a density of2 . 5\u00d71 0 4cells/1000 \u00b5L/well. After overnight incubation, they were exposed to different concentrations (3, 10, 30, and 100 \u00b5g/ mL) of plant extracts, lavender essential oil, and untreated control (0.2% DMSO) for 48 h. Cell culture supernatants and pellets werecollected and immediately frozen at 80 \u00b0C for subsequent analy- sis. All experiments were performed 3 times independently (intriplicate). The metabolic parameters -glucose and lactate -were determined using an automated blood gas (ABL800 Flex,Radiometer Medical ApS) based on amperometric measuringprinciples. Placental cell differentiation and hCG production Two different setups were used to test the influence of plant ex- tracts and lavender essential oil on the induction or inhibition ofplacental cell differentiation. For the induction setup, cells wereseeded into transparent 24-well plates (2.5 \u00d7 10 4cells/1000 \u00b5L/ well) before exposure to different concentrations (3, 10, 30, and100 \u00b5g/mL) of test compounds and control (0.2% DMSO) for 48 h the next day. FSK (50 \u00b5M) was used as the positive control. For the inhibition setup, cells were seeded with 100 \u00b5L/well( 1\u00d71 0 5cells/mL) into transparent 96-well flat-bottom plates on the day before the stimulation with test compounds and cell cul-ture medium.

Nevertheless, these herbal medicines have n ot yet been officially approved in pregnancy due to lack of safety data. Using a variety of in vitro methods (determination of cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, genotoxicity, effects on metabolic properties, inhibition/induction of c ommonly used placental cell line (BeWo b30) , we were previously able to show that extracts from these plants are likely to be safe at the usual clinical doses. In the present work, we wanted to extend our safety assessment of these herbal medicines by 1) looking for possible effects on gene expression and 2) using the same in vitro methods to characterize effects of selected phytochemicals that might conceivably lead to safety issues. Proteomics results were promising, as none of the five extracts significa ntly affected protein expression by up - or down -regulation. Protopine ( contained in California poppy), valerenic acid (in valerian), and linalool (in lavender) were inconspicuous in all experiments and showed no adverse effects. Hyperforin and hypericin (t wo constituents of St. John's wort) and valtrate (typical for valerian) were the most obvious phytochemicals with respect to cytotoxic and apoptotic effects. A decrease in cell viability was evident with hypericin ( 1 \u00b5M) induced apoptosis. None of the tested phytochemicals resulted in genotoxic effects at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 \u00b5M and thus are not DNA damaging. No decrease in glucose consumption or lact ate production was observed under the influence of the phytochemicals, except for valtrate (at all concentrations). No compound affected cell differentiation, except for hyperforin ( 1 \u00b5M), which had an inhibitory effect. This study suggests that extracts from St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops are likely to be safe during pregnancy. High plasma concentrations of some relevant compounds - hyperforin and hypericin from St. John's wort and valtrate from valerian - deserve special attention, however.

Keywords: disorders (NMDs) are a common problem during pregnancy. One multinational study found that on average28.9% of pregnant women used herbal medicines duringpregnancy, although there were signi cant differences between regions/countries, and that the prevalence in Switzerland wasthus very high at 40.6% ( Kennedy et al., 2013 ). In a recent survey we conducted in Switzerland, 51.3% of participants reported amental symptom during pregnancy (such as insomnia, anxiety,and depressive mood). In addition, 13.2% and 4.0% suffered fromacute and chronic mental disorders, respectively. Interestingly,only a few participants used antidepressants (e.g., sertraline, citalopram) and none mentioned (or at least indicated) the use of sedatives/anxiolytics (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam) duringpregnancy. This suggests that pregnant women refrain fromusing synthetic psychoactive medication and prefer resortingto herbal medicines for mild NMD treatment ( Gantner et al., 2021 ). Such behavior is well justi ed, as psychotropic drugs can lead to side effects for both the mother and the fetus or newborn(Howard et al., 2014 ;Stewart and Vigod, 2020 ). Herbal candidates for the treatment of NMDs in pregnancy include St. John 's wort ( lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.). St. John 's wort is a herbal alternative to synthetic antidepressants in the treatment ofmild to moderate depression ( Wurglics and Schubert- Zsilavecz, 2006 ), which ef cacy from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( Cui and Zheng, 2016 ). California poppy has a long tradition of use in aiding sleep andrelieving mild symptoms of mental stress ( European Medicines Agency, 2015a ). There are currently a variety of California poppy products on the market that are approved as phytomedicines(contain either plant extract or powdered drug), but also variousdietary supplements ( European Medicines Agency, 2015b ; Medicinal product information, 2022 ). To avoid resorting to synthetic medications for sleep disorders, a combination ofvalerian and hops offers an alternative treatment. Severalrandomized trials conclude that the valerian-hops combinationmentioned has (modest) hypnotic effects and signi cantly reduces sleep latency ( Morin et al., 2005 et al., 2007 ; Dimpfel and Suter, 2008 ). Constituents of both extracts complement each other: some compounds of valerian act likeendogenous adenosine and increase sleepiness, while rhythmicity ( Brattstr\u00f6m, 2007 ). Although there are a variety of registered valerian-hops preparations on the Swiss market, there are valerian \u2014but not hops \u2014monopreparations (Medicinal product information search platform, 2022).Lavender essential oil is best known for its calming, sedative and anxiolytic effects and is therefore popular in the treatment of restlessness, sleep disorders, and anxiety ( Schilcher et al., 2016 ). The ef cacy and safety of a patented essential oil produced from Lavandula angustifolia flowers for oral administration has been demonstrated in adult patients with generalized anxiety disorderin several trials ( Woelk and Schl\u00e4fke, 2010 ;Kasper et al., 2014 ). The evidence for the safety of the herbal medicines mentioned above in pregnancy is, on the other hand, very limited or non-existent. The Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products of theEuropean Medicine Agency does not recommend the use of theseherbal medicines during pregnancy due to insuf cient safety data (European Medicines Agency, 2009 ;European Medicines Agency, 2012 ;European Medicines Agency, 2014 ;European Medicines Agency, 2015a ;European Medicines Agency, 2016 ). In our survey, 3.5% of pregnant women reported taking St. John 's wort, 5.8% used valerian, lavender was used by 16.2% of by 2.3% ( Gantner et al., 2021 ). In examining the phytochemical composition of the selected herbal candidates for treatments in pregnancy,several compounds stand out that are highly biologicallyactive, found in various species of interest, and/or veryabundant and thus might potentially cause problems froma safety perspective. In our opinion, these include hyperforin and hypericin, which are the most abundant representatives of phloroglucinol derivatives (0.2 -0.4% of total dry weight of the herb) and naphthodianthrones (0.1 -0.3% of total dry weight of the herb) in St. John 'sw o r t( Blaschek, 2016 ). Also, protopine deserves particular attention as one of the majorisoquinoline alkaloids of California poppy ( Tom\u00e8 et al., 1999 ; Fedurco et al., 2015 ), which is also present in several other herbal medicines ( Guinaudeau and Shamma, 1982 ). Furthermore, we chose valerenic acid and valtrate, whichare important representatives of root ( Blaschek, 2016 ). Finally, linalool wa s considered, since it corresponds to approximately one quarter (26.1%) of lavender oil and is often one of the major components in essential oilsproduced by a variety of plants such as hops, coriander,and star anise ( Karab\u00edn et al., 2016 ;Schilcher et al., 2016 ). Linalool was identi ed as the major pharmacologically active constituent involved in the anti-anxiety effect of lavenderessential oil ( Umezu et al., 2006 ). In our previous work, we conducted an initial in vitro assessment of the safety pro le of extracts from St. John\u00b4s wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops. Inconcentrations up to 30 g/ml, they did not possess any cytotoxic or genotoxic potential and did not compromise human placental cell viability, metabolic activity ordifferentiation ( Spiess et al., 2021 ). In a next step, our research Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 882997 2Spiess et al. Safety of Herbal Medicines in Pregnancygoals were to 1) look for possible effects of whole extracts on gene expression and 2) use the same variety of methods as before tocharacterize effects of particularly relevant phytochemicals fromthese extracts. For the above-mentioned reasons, the hyperforin, protopine, valerenic acid, valtrate, and linalool. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Cell Culture The BeWo b30 cell line was provided by Dr. Tina Buerki- Thurnherr (Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for MaterialsScience and Technology, St. Gallen, Switzerland), withpermission from Dr. Alan L. Schwartz (Washington University School of Medicine, MO, United States). As described in a previous study ( Spiess et al., 2021 ), cells were Mix supplemented heatinactivated FBS, antibiotics penicillin, streptavidin) 2 mM L-glutamine (all from Gibco), at 37 \u00b0C and in 5% CO 2humidi ed atmosphere. 2.2 Cell Treatments All plant material was of Ph. Eur. grade. V. of cinalis roots, H. lupulus flowers and H. perforatum herb were purchased from Dixa (lot numbers 180084, 191241, 192140, respectively). E. californica herb was obtained 811502). Voucher specimens (numbers 1029, 1167, 1166 and 1234,respectively) have been deposited at the Division ofPharmaceutical Biology, University of Basel. The powderedplant material was extracte d with 70% EtOH by pressurized liquid extraction in a Dionex ASE 200 Accelerated SolventExtractor. Three cycles of extraction of 5 min each wereperformed at a temperature of 70 \u00b0C and a pressure of 120 bar. L. angustifolia essential oil Ph. Eur. was purchased from H\u00e4nseler (lot number 2018.01.0274). See SupportingInformation of our previous work ( Spiess et al., 2021 )f o r characterization of all hydroalcoholic extracts and of L. angustifolia essential oil. The following phytochemicals were obtained from commercial sources: hyperforin, hyperforindicyclohexylammonium (Sigma-Aldrich),protopine and valerenic valtrate(Toronto Research Chemicals). Dry herbal extracts andpure phytochemicals were dissolved in sterile DMSO(Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at -80 \u00b0C. BeWo b30 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of phytochemicals (upto 30 M, a concentration higher than all reported achieved plasma concentrations; compare with discussion) in culture medium. Control cells were exposed to a nal concentration of 0.3% DMSO so as not to decrease cell viability. The biochemical and morphological differentiation of BeWo b30cells was stimulated with 5 \u00b5M forskolin (FSK; Lucerna-Chem;dilution from a 30 mM stock solution prepared in DMSO).Due to light sensitivity and to avoid phototoxicity undertreatment with St. John 's wort extract, hyperforin and hypericin, the relevant experiments were performed with aslittle light as possible.2.3 Protein Analysis 2.3.1 Sample Preparation BeWo b30 cells were seeded into transparent T25 culture flasks at a density of 776 400 cells/6,000 \u00b5l/ flask. After overnight incubation, they were exposed to 30 g/ml of plant extract ( H. perforatum ,E. cinalis ) or untreated control (0.06% DMSO) for 48 h. Cell culture supernatants were then discarded and attached cells wererinsed with PBS and then detached by adding a 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, following 1 -2 min incubation (37 \u00b0C). The trypsinization process was stopped by the addition of cellculture growth medium and the flasks were rinsed carefully. The cell suspensions were centrifuged (at 1,300 rpm at 23 \u00b0C for 5 min). The cell pellets were washed a total of three times(by aspirating the supernatant and resuspending the cell pellet in 10 ml PBS). The cells were then counted and 1 000 000 cells per condition were centrifuged. The corresponding cell pellets wereimmediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (without buffer) andstored at 80 \u00b0C for subsequent analysis of proteins. For each sample, proteins were extracted using a tissue homogenizer (TissueLyser II, QUIAGEN) and digested byusing a commercial iST Kit (PreOmics). Brie fly, 150 \u00b5l of 'Lyse 'buffer and around 150 mg of glass beads (425 -500m, Sigma) were added to each cell pellet. After 2 cycles of proteinextraction (2 min each, 30 Hz) and incubation for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C, the solubility of the extracted proteins was enhanced by processing the samples with High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for 1 min, setting the ultrasonic amplitude to 85%followed by additional incubation for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14 000 g the supernatant was used for further processing. The proteins (50 \u00b5g in each case) weredigested on the membrane by adding 50 \u00b5l of the 'Digest ' solution. After 60 min of incubation at 37 \u00b0C the digestion was stopped with 100 \u00b5l of, Stop, solution. The samples were thencentrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to the cartridge.The solutions in the cartridge were removed by centrifugation at3,800 g, while the peptides were retained by the iST- lter. Finally, the peptides were washed, eluted, dried and re-solubilized in 20 \u00b5l of injection buffer (3% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Prior to LC-MS analysis, concentrations were estimated bymeans of a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and the injectionamounts normalized to an absorbance of 0.3 at 280 nm. 2.3.2 Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scienti c) equipped with a Digital PicoView source (New Objective) and coupled to an M-Class UPLC(Waters). Solvent composition at the two channels was 0.1% formic acid for channel A and 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile for channel B. For each sample, 1 l of diluted peptides were loaded on a commercial MZ Symmetry C18Trap Column (100\u00c5, 5 m, 180 m \u00d7 20 mm, Waters) followed by a nanoEase MZ C18 HSS T3 Column (100 \u00c5, 1.8 \u00b5m, 75 m\u00d7 250 mm, Waters). The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 L/ min by a gradient from 5 to 22% B in 77 min, 32% B in 10 min and95% B for 10 min. Samples were acquired in a randomized order. Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 882997 3Spiess et al. Safety of Herbal Medicines in PregnancyThe mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, acquiring a full-scan MS spectra (300 -1,500 m/z) at a resolution of 120 000 at 200 m/zafter accumulation to a target value of 500 000. Data-dependent MS/MS were recorded in the linear ion trap using quadrupole isolation with a window of 0.8 Da and HCD fragmentation with 35% fragmentation energy. The ion trapwas operated in rapid scan mode with a target value of 10 000 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Only precursors with anintensity above 5 000 were selected for MS/MS and the maximum cycle time was set to 3 s. Charge state screening was enabled.Singly, unassigned and charge states higher than seven wererejected. Precursor masses previously selected for MS/MSmeasurement were excluded from further selection for 20 s,and the exclusion window was set at 10 ppm. The sampleswere acquired using internal lock mass calibration on m/z 371.1012 and 445.1200. The mass spectrometry proteomics data were handled using the local laboratory informationmanagement system ( T\u00fcrker et al., 2010 ) and all relevant data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via thePRIDE ( Perez-Riverol et al., 2022 identi er PXD031765. Protein Identi cation and Label Free Protein Quanti cation The acquired raw MS data were processed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.3), followed by protein identi cation using the integrated Andromeda search engine ( Cox and Mann, 2008 ). One separate MaxQuant experiment was set up for each set of sample (B015, B020,B035, and HMEV21). Spectra were searched against a swissprotcanonical Homo sapiens proteome (taxonomy 9,606, version from concatenated decoyed fasta databaseand common cation, while methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation were set as variable. Enzymespecicity was set to trypsin/P allowing a minimal peptide length of 7 amino acids and a maximum of two missed-cleavages. MaxQuantOrbitrap default search settings were used. The maximum false discovery rate was set to 0.01 for peptides and 0.05 for proteins. Label free quanti cation was enabled and a 2 min window for match between runs was applied. In the MaxQuant experimental designtemplate, each le is kept separate in the experimental design to obtain individual quantitative values. The MaxQuant results wereloaded into Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc.) to validate the peptideand protein identi cations. Only proteins identi ed with at least 2 peptides were considered for follow up analysis. The statisticalsignicance threshold was set to an adjusted p-value 0.2, and a log 2FC>\u00b11. 2.4 Functional Assays The same plethora of functional assays was used as in our previous work with herbal extracts ( Spiess et al., 2021 ), as briefly described in the following. 2.4.1 Viability Assay The in vitro cytotoxicity of the different concentrations of phytochemicals (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5M) wastested using a 96-well density of 2 \u00d7 10 4cells/100 \u00b5l/ well on the day before exposure to the positive controls. After 72 h of incubation, culture supernatant was aspirated and replaced bymedium without phenol red, and 5 \u00b5l Cell Proliferation ReagentWST-1 (Roche) was added. A spectrophotometric measurementwas taken (450 nm) after 75 min of incubation, using a platereader (Tecan In nite M 200). 2.4.2 Apoptosis Assay BeWo b30 cells were subjected to the same treatment described for the WST-1 assay to assess the level of apoptosis after application ofthe test substances. After 72 h of incubation, the cells were washedwith PBS and detached using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich). All liquids were pooled and centrifuged for 5 min (300 g), followed by an AnnexinV-FITC (eBioscience) staining, which was performedaccording to the manufacturer 's instructions. A flow cytometric readout was obtained and analyzed using appropriate software (BDFACScalibur, BD Biosciences, FlowJo Software). 2.4.3 Comet Assay A comet assay was used to examine the genotoxic potential of theselected phytochemicals. Microscopic slides were coated with 1%normal-melting agarose in PBS (SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH)beforehand. Cells were seeded with a density of 4 \u00d7 10 5cells/100 \u00b5l/well on the day before exposure. Different concentrations of phytochemicals (0.1, 1, and 10 \u00b5M) or 3 mM ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS, positive control; Sigma-Aldrich) wereadded for 3 h. A slightly boiling 0.7% normal-melting agarosesolution (200 \u00b5l) was then applied to the precoated slides. Thecells were once washed with PBS, dissolved using Accutase(Sigma-Aldrich) and resuspended in 30 \u00b5l complete medium.The cells were with (SERVA Electrophoresis and kept at 38\u00b0C prior to use) and added as a nal layer to the slides. Electrophoresis was performed at 25 V/300 mA for20 min. The slides were nally washed with ddH 2O and PBS and xed with 99% EtOH. Fixed samples were stained with ethidium bromide solution (5 g/ml; Carl Roth GmbH), and images were taken for later analysis with CometScore software (version 2.0.038for Windows; TriTek Corp., United States). 2.4.4 Glucose and Lactate Concentration Measurements Cells were seeded into transparent 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 104cells/1,000 \u00b5l/well. After overnight incubation, they were exposed to different concentrations (1, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5M) ofphytochemicals or untreated control (0.2% DMSO) for 48 h. Cellculture supernatants and pellets were collected and immediatelyfrozen at 80 \u00b0C for subsequent analysis of the metabolic parameters (glucose/lactate) and protein concentrations,respectively. Glucose and lactate were determined using anautomated blood gas analyzer (ABL800 Flex, RadiometerMedical ApS).

To test the ability toinhibit differentiation, cells were seeded into 96-well flat-bottom plates (1 \u00d7 10 4cells/100 \u00b5l/well). After an overnight incubation, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of phytochemicals(serial dilution below apoptotic concentrations based on preliminaryresults), control or FSK control (5 \u00b5M) for 24 h.Afterwards all cells (except contr ol) were differentiated with FSK ( 5 \u00b5 M )f o ra n o t h e r2 4 h .A n a l y s i so f -hCG concentrations \u2014a marker of placenta cell differentiation \u2014was performed by standard ELISA using cell culture supernatants. 2.5 Linalool Analysis GC/MS was performed on a Hewlett-Packard system(Agilent a Gauge was 260 \u00b0C.

From approximately 4,000 proteins identi ed in each case, only a few exceptional proteins were signicantly altered after incubation with the herbal extracts of St. John 's wort (4/4,060; RN149, Supplementary Table S1 for additional information and their functions). Some proteins were only identi ed in either the treated (herbal extract) or untreated (0.06% DMSO) sample (adjustedp-value = 0.001; see Supplementary Table S2 -S6for additional information). Most importantly, no enrichments of biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, or proteinclasses and pathways were found when submitting the list ofdifferentially regulated or only in one condition identi ed proteins to a tool for Gene-Set Enrichment analysis. Theamounts of most of the proteins were similar in the absenceand presence of the extracts. 3.2 Functional Assays To perform an in-depth analysis of the safety of the herbalmedicines investigated, phytochemicals that might conceivably cause issues from a safety point of view were chosen. With these individual compounds, we performed various in vitro assessments in BeWo cells, starting with effects on cellviability ( Figure 2 ). Hyperforin, which is present in St. John 's wort extract, did not lead to pronounced cytotoxic effects in aconcentration range of 0.01 -30 \u00b5M. However, for hypericin, which is also a major component of the same extract, fullviability was only maintained up to a concentration of 0.3 \u00b5M,since at 1, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5M it was strongly reduced. Protopine, arepresentative of California poppy, did not reduce cell viabilityfrom a concentration range of 0.01 -10M; a reduction in cell viability was observed at 30 \u00b5M only. Valerenic acid, which is present in valerian extract, showed no effect on cell viability up tohigh concentrations of 30 \u00b5M. In contrast, valtrate (also presentin valerian extract) decreased viability at 10 and 30 \u00b5M by 83%and 89%, respectively. Linalool (contained in lavender essentialoil) showed no cytotoxicity after 72 h of incubation atconcentrations of up to 30 \u00b5M. Since linalool is highly volatile,we investigated whether (calculated) concentration was retainedduring diverse experimental conditions at 37 \u00b0C(Supplementary Table S7 ). Results show that after 3 h, 60 -85% of the original linalool was still present in the cell culture medium, whereas after 48 h, this corresponded to 36 -44%. Protopine, valerenic acid, and linalool did not induce apoptosis at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 30 \u00b5M(Figure 3 ). However, hyperforin at concentrations of 3 \u00b5M and above, and valtrate at concentrations of 10 and 30 \u00b5Mrevealed increased apoptotic levels compared to control.Hypericin showed a clear-cut even if not signi cant increase at 1 \u00b5M. At higher concentrations, and also in accordance with theresults of the viability assay, the number of total detected cells was Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 882997 6Spiess et al. Safety of Herbal Medicines in PregnancyFIGURE 2 | Effects of phytochemicals on cell viability of undifferentiated BeWo b30 cells after 72 h of treatment. Among the phytochemicals present in St. John 's wort, such as hyperforin (A)and hypericin (B), only the latter resulted in a signi cant reduction in cell viability at concentrations of 1, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5M. Protopine (C) (present in California poppy) reduced cell viability by 62.4% at a concentration of 30 \u00b5M. Of the phytochemicals present in valerian, such as valereni ca c i d (D)and valtrate (E), only the latter resulted in a signi cant reduction in cell viability at concentrations of 10 and 30 \u00b5M. Linalool (F)(ingredient of lavender oil) did not show any signi cant effect in a concentration range from 0.01 up to 30 \u00b5M. The effects are shown as fold change compared to the untreated control. Treatments with camptothecin (CPT, 300 \u00b5M) and Triton-X-100 (TX, 0.5%) served as toxicity controls. Results were normalized to untreated control signal = 100% ( n= 3). Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 882997 7Spiess et al.

Safety of Herbal Medicines in Pregnancyextremely low (not shown); results on the percentage of apoptotic cells concern only the few detectable cells. Comet assays were performed to determine whether the selected phytochemicals can lead to possible genotoxicity at concentrations up to 10 \u00b5M ( Figure 4 Repetitively, protopine, valerenic acid, and linalool were unremarkable, aspredominantly intact nuclear DNA was detected after 3 h of celltreatment; thus none of these substances led to a signi cant increase in tail DNA. Hyperforin, hypericin, and valtrate showedgenotoxicity in this assay, but only when the highestconcentration of 10 \u00b5M was applied. The effects of phytochemicals on metabolic parameters, such as glucose and lactate, were examined and expressed as consumption or production, respectively ( Figure 5 ). Data were normalized to the protein content. Valerian was the only phytochemical which led to changes in glycolytic metabolism at concentrations of 1, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5M by signi cantly reducing glucose consumption and lactate production of BeWo None of valerenic acid, activity of viable BeWo b30 cells when tested at high concentrations of up to 30 \u00b5M. Glucose and lactate concentrations of cell supernatants were not statistically different from those of the untreated control. However, hyperforin led to a signi cant increase in glucose consumption and a concomitant increase in lactate production at lowerconcentrations of 1 and 3 \u00b5M. Finally, the impact of the various phytochemicals on the induction of placental cell differentiation was examined, rst, by measuring the secretion of the differentiation marker -hCG (Figure 6A ), and second, by the opposite approach, namely whether 24 h pre-incubation with the various phytochemicalscould inhibit cell differentiation (as induced by FSK; Figures 6B,C ). In the rst measurement, and after the addition of FSK as a positive control, there was a 42-fold increase in -hCG levels, which is characteristic of BeWo cell differentiation. In contrast, none of the six phytochemicals (hyperforin, hypericin, protopine,valerenic acid, valtrate, and linalool) triggered an increase in - hCG production in BeWo cells. For the inhibition assay of placental cell differentiation, only non-toxic concentrations of each phytochemical (based on preliminary data, not shown) were chosen ( Figure 6B ). In these assays also, the addition of FSK for 24 h and pre-incubation with cell culture medium for 24 h resulted in 9-fold increased -hCG levels. Under these conditions, most of the phytochemicals (in different concentrations ranging from 0.03 up to 30 \u00b5M) had no statistically signi cant inhibitory effect on the FSK-induced placenta cell differentiation. However, a 24 h pre-incubation with the highest concentrations of hyperforin (1, 3, and 10 \u00b5M) did inhibit the following differentiation of BeWo b30 cells. To con rm this, the assay was repeated on a bigger scale to show the hormone concentration normalized to the amount ofprotein (\u00b5g) ( Figure 6C ).

However, valtrate (E)decreased the glycolytic metabolism at concentrations of 1, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5M. Phytochemicals of St. John 's wort led to increased glucose consumption and concomitant lactate production in the case of hyperforin treatment (A)at 1 and 3 \u00b5M and increased lactate concentrations in the case of hypericin (B)at 1 \u00b5M.

When we focused on compounds that might conceivablycause safety issues, no decreased cell viability and inductionof apoptosis could be observed in a concentration rangebetween 0.01 \u00b5M. \u00b5M) led to cytotoxic effects and thus decreased the viability of BeWo ) , a n d v a l t r a t e(10 \u00b5M) induced cell apoptosis. No genotoxic effects were observed for any of the tested phytochemical concentrations of0.1 and 1 \u00b5M. Hyperforin, hypericin, and valtrate onlyDNA-damaging \u00b5M. A 48-hexposure of valtrate ( 1 \u00b5M) resulted in reduced glucose consumption and thus reduced lactate production by placental cells; all in cubations with the other phytochemicals at concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 \u00b5Mresulted in viable cells with normal glycolytic metabolism.None of the tested phytochemicals were able to induce orinhibit BeWo b30 cell differentiation, except hyperforin, whichwas able to inhibit FSK-induced cell differentiation atconcentrations of \u00b5M. To summarize ( 1 ), protopine, valerenic acid, and linalool were veryinconspicuous in all vitro experiments. Valtrate resulted in cytotoxic, apoptotic, and genotoxic effects ( 10 \u00b5M) which 1\u00b5 M ) .

Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments ( n=3-4; upon 48-h treatment with increasing concentrations of phytochemicals (1, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5M) vs. FSK control. (B)Effects on inhibition of BeWo cells.

Based on prelimin ary data (not shown), different concentration gradients (ranging from 0.03 up to 30 \u00b5M) of phytochemicals were individually determined in advance (before exposu re). Cells were pre- treated with the different phytochemicals for 24 h, before the addition of FSK for another 24 h.

Safety of Herbal Medicines in Pregnancywort, also showed increased toxicity at concentrations 1M, with the former inhibiting placental cell differentiation (1 \u00b5M) as well. To put the potential toxicity of the phytochemicals in perspective, available data on achievableplasma concentrations are also presented in Table 1 . 4.2 Strengths and Limitations A major strength of this in vitro study is the LC-MS/MS based proteomics approach, which allowed us to study activation orinhibition of pathways important for cell viability,proliferation, and differentiation. Moreover, and as donebefore with extracts, conceivably critical phytochemicals were studied using a variety of well-established assays with shorter (3 h) and longer (72 h) exposure times, including awide range of concentrations (from 0.01 up to 30 \u00b5M). Becauseof the lack or limited applicability of pharmacokinetic data,these concentrations were chosen to cover up to a hundredtimes the maximum achievable plasma concentrations afteroral application (compare with ( Agrosi et al., 2000 )). One limitation of the relevance of our data to everyday practice isthat most manufacturers do not provide information on thecontents of the individual natural products, which makes itvery dif cult to discuss physiologically relevant concentration ranges of single phytochemicals. In addition, we here characterized the in vitro safety of a few compounds only, which is another limitation since the herbal medicines aremulticomponent mixtures; the reader is, however, referred toour previous work ( Spiess et al., 2021 ) for the results obtained with the corresponding extracts in the same functional assays.Finally, it is important to remember that the cell line representsonly one layer of the placenta and thus does not fully re flect the biological environment of the placenta barrier and that ADMEaspects are not considered in the used in vitro models. 4.3 Herbal Medicines and NMD Treatment In the following, our present observations relevant for a safety assessment of each of the herbal medicines are discussed in thecontext of available literature.Incubation with St. John 'sw o r t extract did not induce relevant changes in protein expression. Out of 4,060 detected proteins, only 3 were up-regulated (RN149, TAP26, 1 highly active phytochemicalsrevealed that for hyperforin , there is no cause for concern about concentrations \u00b5M, as apoptosis differentiation(1 \u00b5M) were increased only at the indicated concentrations. Concentrations of 1 \u00b5M of hyperforin are atleast 3 times higher than maximum achieved plasmaconcentrations upon treatment with common preparations. These vary widely depending on daily doses tested, dosing regimen, formulation (soft/hard gelatin capsules), andmanufacturer ( Agrosi et al., 2000 ;Schulz et al., 2005 ; Vitiello et al., 2005 ). At high concentrations, hyperforin could pose embryotoxic and teratogenic risks since itinhibited the growth and differentiation of embryonic stemcells and induced apoptosis in broblasts ( Nakamura et al., 2013 ). The highest plasma concentration recorded in the literature is 168.35 ng/ml of hyperforin after administrationof a soft gelatin capsule (300 mg St. John 'sw o r td r ye x t r a c t containing 5% hyperforin and 0.3% hypericin, Hammer Pharma SpA), which converts to approximately 0.3 \u00b5M. Hypericin showed no toxicity up to a concentration of 0.3 \u00b5M, as cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and genotoxicity wereincreased only above 1, 1, and 10 M, respectively. Hypericin is less abundant in St. John 'sw o r tt h a n hyperforin ( Blaschek, 2016 ), and maximum peak plasma concentrations of 4.43 ng/ml have been reported withmultiple dose administration ( Schulz et al., 2005 ), corresponding to approximately 8.8 nM, which is 33 timeslower than 0.3 \u00b5M. The amount of hypericin as well ashyperforin were recently quanti ed in different formulations on the Swiss market by HPLC ( Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2019 ). It was found that the declared and the actually quanti ed contents differed considerably in some cases. In addition, all formulations contained hypericin, but hyperforinTABLE 1 | Summary of the effectsaof plant extracts and their constituents on cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, metabolic activity, and their ability to induce or inhibit cell differentiation, in addition to reported plasma concentrations in literature.

Safety of Herbal Medicines in Pregnancywas not detected in two products (Vogel HyperiMed \u00aeand Vogel Hyperiforce \u00ae) and its was very low (Rebalance \u00aeand Remotiv \u00ae). Since we detected an inhibition of differentiation starting at 1 \u00b5M of hyperforin and any alteration in the physiological development of the placenta might be critical from a safety point of view, in our opinionformulations with a low hyperforin content could be preferredin pregnancy. In our previous study on whole extracts, St.John 'sw o r ts h o w e dn os i g n i cant effects up to a concentration of 30 g/ml extract for all types of in vitro experiments, namely cell viability, apoptosis, genotoxicity, metabolic activity, andinhibition/induction et al., 2021 ). In general, there is a lack of adequate clinical studies on the genotoxicity of St. John 's wort, as well as tests on reproductive toxicity, and fertility ( Greeson et al., 2001 ;Avila et al., 2018 ). Well known issues such as phototoxicity ( Onoue et al., 2011 ) and interactions with other medications ( Nicolussi et al., 2020 ) must be taken care of also during administration in pregnancy. Moreover, a few studies which were eitherprospective ( Kolding et al., 2015 ) or based on data analysis of a national birth cohort ( Moretti et al., 2009 ) or on claim data (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2021 ) seem to suggest an increased risk of fetal malformation in pregnant women exposed to St. John 'sw o r t preparations. While the results are striking, they should beinterpreted with caution. In the case of California poppy , there were no relevant changes in protein expression when BeWo b30 placental cells were incubated with the extract only one protein(ANR35) was signi cantly upregulated (1/3,353). California poppy, and several other medicinal plants of the Papaveraceaefamily (e.g., Papaver, Chelidonium, and Argemone, etc.) aswell as of plant (e.g., Berberidaceae,Fumariaceae, and Ranunculaceae, ( Guinaudeau protopine , and this phytochemical was also investigated. We found a minimalcytotoxic potential, as only the viability assay showed slightsignicance at the highest concentration of 30 \u00b5M. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of pharmacokinetic studies of protopine in the literature, which makes it dif cult to compare the test concentrations we used with physiologicallyrelevant plasma concentrations in humans. Especially ADMEstudies are needed to predict any in vivo effects of protopine. How much protopine is present in commercially availablepreparations from California poppy is also unknown andrequires further clari c a t i o n .O u rp r e v i o u s( Spiess et al., 2021 ) and current in vitro contributions to the study of California Poppy (and protopine) would be in line with agood safety pro le. The proteomics approach is also indicative of good safety forvalerian . Incubation with the corresponding extract led to no relevant changes in the proteome. In fact, only 2 proteins(COPRS, AN32B) out of 3,423 signi cantly set-ups, two biologically active included. Valerenic acid showed neither toxicological effects, nor signi cant effects on metabolic properties (glucose consumption, lactate production) nor differentiation of BeWob30 cells in a concentration range between 0.01 -30 \u00b5M. Valtrate , however, showed signi cant toxic effects, as cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and genotoxicity were increased under the in fluence of 10 \u00b5M. In addition, valtrate was also the only ingredient that had signi cant effects on the metabolic properties of BeWo b30 cells at levels as low as1 \u00b5M. From a translational perspective, these effects must beinterpreted with caution, as valepotriates (like valtrate) arevery unstable and are easily degraded by exposure to heat,a c i d so rb a s e s( Blaschek, 2016 ). Also, in the extract used in our previous ( Spiess et al., 2021 ) and present study no valtrate was present. To our knowledge, no data on plasma concentrationsof valtrate exist. For valerenic acid, a maximum serum level of2.8g/ml (i.e. 18.2 \u00b5M) was reported in one subject after a single administration of 600 mg valerian (Sedonium TM, Lichtwer Pharma) via indwelling catheter in the arm vein (Anderson et al., 2005 ). Upon oral application, lower plasma concentrations are to be expected. As a reminder, we includedconcentrations of valerenic acid of up to 30 \u00b5M in most assaysof our study. Since even at these concentrations no effect wasobserved and, in addition, valerian extract ( 30g/ml) had no negative effect on BeWo b30 cells from a toxicological andmetabolic point of view, as well as on placental celldifferentiation, our work is in line with good safety forvalerian in pregnancy. Studies with animals also found thatorally administered valerian extract had no adverse effects on fertility or fetal development ( Yao et al., 2007 ). Finally, lavender essential oil did not affect protein expression in any relevant way. Of the 3,999 proteinsidenti ed, only 24 were signi cantly up- (3 proteins) or downregulated (21 proteins). Importantly, no explicitpathway was overly involved. Lavender oil was also highlyinconspicuous in all functional assays from our previous study(Spiess et al., 2021 ) .T h es a m ea s s a y sw e r en o wp e r f o r m e d with linalool , one of the two major components of the essential oil. The results revealed no impairment of BeWocells at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5M initial concentration. Additional experiments showed that some linalool volatizes during the incubations, therefore with time this initialconcentration might have been reduced by up to 64%(30 \u00b5M would then be reduced to approximately 10 \u00b5M).Of particular importance is the comparison with maximumdetermined plasma concentrations of linalool (Lasea \u00ae,D r . Willmar reached after single administration of 80 mg (therapeuticdose) or multiple administrations (14-days application) of160 mg, respectively ( M\u00fcller et al., 2015 ). These concentrations are therefore markedly lower than those used in our study, even when accounting for volatilization.Plasma concentrations upon liniments or embrocations withlavender oil are not known. Regardless of pregnancy,attention should be drawn to the common adversereactions ( <1/10, 1/100) such as gastrointestinal disturbances (gastroesophageal re nausea) and allergic skin reactions (urticaria, pr uritus, exanthema) (Medicinal product information search platform (AIPS), 2022).

Safety of Herbal Medicines in PregnancyThe hops extract was very inconspicuous in our proteomics studies, as out of a total of 3,387 proteins only one (NAGAB) wassignicantly upregulated. Various in vitro toxicity assays showed no negative effects either up to 30 g/ml (cytotoxicity) or even 100g/ml (apoptosis, genotoxicity, metabolic differentiation) ( Spiess et al., 2021 ). To our knowledge there are no concerns about a speci c phytochemical from hops. To date, there are no hop conemono-preparations available in Switzerland. Their dry extractsare often combined with well-established medicinal plants such asvalerian root or passion flower herb, as their effects complement each other well (Medicinal product information search platform(AIPS), 2022). Our data imply no signi cant harm from a toxicological perspective. 5 FINAL STATEMENT In conclusion, the herbal extracts and some of their constituentsof St. John 's wort (hyperforin, hypericin), California poppy (protopine), (valerenic acid, hops showed no toxicological abnormalities in arelevant (low) concentration range, suggesting that low doses of these herbal medicines are likely to be safe during pregnancy. Since hyperforin was able to inhibit placental cell differentiationof cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts ( 1 \u00b5M), St. John 's wort formulations with a low hyperforin content shouldpreferably be consumed during pregnancy. Furtherexperimental work should focus on potential fetal exposure,evaluating the transplacental transport of hyperforin \u2014and other compounds that might affect relevant cellular processesand/or cause genotoxic effects. Finally and in view of the urgentneed for herbal medicines as treatment options for NMDs inpregnancy, more prospective clinical studies should be conducted to evaluate both ef cacy and safety of the most promising herbal medicines.

The model was first validated with diazepam and citalopram, 2 compounds known to cross the placenta l barrier, and antipyrine as a positive control. All compounds were quantified by partially validated U(H)PLC -MS/MS bioanalytical methods. Protopine was transferred from the maternal to the fetal circuit, with a steady -state reached after 90 min. The study compound did not affect placental viability or functionality, as glucose consumption, lactate production, and beta - human chorionic gonadotropin, and leptin release remained constant. Histopathological evaluation of all placental specimens showed unremarka ble, age -appropriate parenchymal maturation with no pathologic findings.

The model was first validated with diazepam and citalopram, 2 compounds known to cross the placental barrier, and antipyrine as a posi-tive control. All compounds were quantified by partially vali-dated U(H)PLC MS/MS bioanalytical methods. Protopine was transferred from the maternal to the fetal circuit, with asteady-state reached after 90 min. The study compound didnot affect placental viability or functionality, as glucose con-sumption, lactate production, and chorionic gonadotropin, and an Ex Vivo Human Perfusion System * These authors contributed equally to the work. ** Present address: Oncodesign SA, Villebon-sur-Yvette, FranceOriginal Papers 194Spiess published online: 2022-08-22Introduction During pregnancy, a large number of women need medical care. Pharmacotherapy in pregnant women is challenging, given thatadverse effects on the embryo/fetus have to be considered [1]. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that pregnant women are, in most cases, actively excluded from clinical drug develop-ment trials. This severely reduces the number of medications la-beled for use during pregnancy [2, 3]. As a consequence, cliniciansoften make use of the so-called off-label prescribing (i.e., they ad-vise the use of medications in a way that diverges from the ap-proved product information [e.g., indication, application, dosage,patient categories]) [4]. Probably for all these reasons, expectant mothers often perceive synthetic medications as potentially dan- gerous. They try to reduce their consumption [5, 6] and seek sup-posedly safe alternatives, such as phytomedicines. In a multina-tional study, an average of 28.9% of pregnant women reportedusing herbal medicines during pregnancy, with an even higherproportion of 40.6% in Switzerland [7]. Some of the phytomedicines are used in the treatment of non- psychotic mental disorders (NMDs) in pregnancy, such as sleep disorders, restlessness, anxiety, and mild depression. A recent prevalence estimate in Switzerland reported that 16.7% of perina-tal women used mental healthcare [8]. The perception of phytomedicines as safe in pregnancy [9] contradicts that studies on their safety in pregnancy are essen-tially lacking. For example, how much phytochemicals can passacross the placental barrier to reach the fetus is unknown. Weare currently investigating the transplacental transfer of selected compounds from medicinal plants used to treat mild NMDs in pregnancy to shed some light on the matter.California poppy ( Eschscholzia californica Cham., Papaveraceae) has a long tradition among indigenous people in the USA [10].The CHMP has classified it for traditional use as a sleeping aidand for the relief of mild symptoms of mental stress [11]. VariousEschscholzia products are on the market, ranging from approved phytomedicines to food supplements available via the internet.They contain either powdered herbal drug or extract as the activeingredient, sometimes combined with other herbs. Very few products have been standardized for their content in total alka- loids [12 -14]. California poppy contains 0.5% total al- kaloids, with protopine, a phytochemical that is also present inseveral other herbal medicines [15], being one of the major com-pounds [16 -18]. Extracts of California poppy have shown sedative and anxiolytic effects in vivo [10], and these properties have been attributed to the isoquinoline alkaloids [19]. Several in vitro stud- ies suggest that protopine is a CNS-active compound. Protopine was found to bind rat synaptic mem- brane preparations [20,21]. shown to be a lig-and at 5-HT 1Areceptors expressed in human CHO cell membranes [22]. The alkaloid is also an inhibitor of transporters in murine S6 and N1 cells, respectively[23]. The CHMP does not recommend using California poppy dur-ing pregnancy due to a lack of sufficient safety data [11]. A broad range of in vitro and in vivo models have been used to assess fetal exposure to exogenous compounds. Chronically can- nulated sheep have been used extensively, and in situ placental perfusion techniques in rodents (guinea pigs, rabbits) have beenestablished [24]. Ex vivo perfusion models with rats [25] and mice [26] have been used for an early screening of substance transferacross the placental barrier. However, with all animal models, theextrapolation of results to humans is limited due to functionallyand anatomically large interspecies differences [24,27,28]. In vitro models utilizing well-established human placental cell lines (e.g., BeWo, Jar, JEG-3 cells) or human placental primary cells (vil-lous trophoblasts) and explant tissue have been employed. Theselatter models enable the study of various factors affecting thetransplacental transport, such as uptake, efflux, and metabolism.BeWo b30 cells clone of the semi-permeable membrane of Transwell inserts can beused as an in vitro model for the placental barrier. However, all cell-based placental models lack the cellular organization, com- partmentalization and 3-dimensional structure of intact, physio-logically active placentae [29]. The current gold standard amongthe placental transfer models is the ex vivo perfusion utilizing hu- man placentae that are obtained immediately after delivery [30 - 32]. Here, the structure of the cotyledon as a functional unit ofthe placenta is fully preserved [33], and data obtained are highlypredictive of the in vivo transfer [34]. We here determined the transplacental transfer of protopine, a major alkaloid in California poppy [35] and several other medicinalplants [15], side by side with compounds known to cross theplacental barrier, like antipyrine, citalopram, and diazepam( Fig. 1 ). The effects of protopine on the viability of placental tis- sue and the production of placental hormones were also investi-gated.ABBREVIATIONS 96-DWP 96-deepwell plate Cal calibration sample CHMP Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products EMA European Agency ESI electrospray ionization FITC fluorescein isothiocyanate FM concentration ratio IS internal standard LLOQ lower limit of quantification MeCN acetonitrile NMD non-psychotic mental disorder PM perfusion medium QC quality control QCH quality controls at high levels QCL quality controls at low levels QCM quality controls at medium levels SS stock solution ULOQ upper limit of quantification WS working solution -hCG beta-human gonadotropin 194 -207 | \u00a9 2022. The first step, the ex vivo placental perfusion model -with which we wanted to study the transfer of protopine validated with 2 ). a connectivity (positive) control in all placental perfusions to verify the overlap of the ma-ternal and the fetal side. Citalopram and diazepam crossed the hu-man placental barrier as expected [36, 37]. After approximately60 min, a steady-state concentration was achieved on the fetalside corresponding to 11% of the initially present citalopram at the maternal side. Thereby, a steady-state concentration of 22% was reached on the maternal side. Concentrations did not changeduring the following 300 min ( Fig. 2a ). For diazepam, steady- state concentrations were reached after approximately 45 min, with 24% of the initially analyzed concentration and a slow de- crease until 360 min ( Fig. 2b ). Antipyrine also readily crossed the placental barrier and reached a steady-state concentrationafter approximately 120 min ( Fig. 2c and d). These findings aligned with previous work and confirmed that antipyrine was asuitable connectivity control [38]. Protopine was also transferred from the maternal to the fetal circuit. A gradual decrease of protopine in the maternal compart- ment and a concomitant increase in the fetal compartment were observed. After about 60 min, a steady-state was established in Fig. 1 Structures of connectivity control (antipyrine), the selected phytochemical (protopine), and synthetic study compounds (citalopram, diazepam).

Concentra- tions are expressed as a percentage (%) of initial analyzed concentration in the maternal sample. All values are expressed as mean \u00b1 standarddeviation (SD). Perfusion profiles with absolute concentrations (ng/mL) can be found in Fig. 1S (Supporting Information). 196Spiess D et al. Placental Passage of ...Planta 194 -207 | \u00a9 2022. The author(s).Original Papers the 2 circuits, with virtually no change over the remaining 300 min (approximately 27% [maternal] vs. 20% [fetal] of initially analyzed concentration; Fig. 2e ). The overlap of maternal and fetal circuits was again confirmed with antipyrine reaching anequilibrium after 120 -240 min ( Fig. 2f ). Perfusion profiles with absolute concentrations (ng/mL) can be found in Fig. 1S (Support- ing Information). If the fetal-maternal concentration ratio (FM ratio; Fig. 3 )o f protopine is considered, no concentration equilibrium was appar-ent in the fetal and maternal compartments at any point of the placental perfusion (FM ratio of 0.75 after 360 min). The profiles of the synthetic compounds are shown for comparison. In citalo-pram, an equilibrium between fetal and maternal concentrationswas never reached (FM ratio of 0.63 after 360 min). As for diaze-pam, the FM ratio was comparable to that of antipyrine (0.98 vs.0.95 at 360 min). The 360 min system nonspecific adherence tests (empty per- fusions; Fig. 4 ), which were performed without placenta and only in the maternal circuit, revealed that only minor proportions of protopine and the connectivity control antipyrine were lostover 360 min (20.4% and 7.5% of initially analyzed concentration,respectively). The relative am ount of citalopram and d iazepam which adhered to the perfusion equipment after 360 min, was sig-nificantly higher with 48.4% and 54.8%, respectively. Several aspects must be considered for the recovery calcula- tions ( Fig. 5 and Table 1S , Supporting Information) of study compounds during placental perfusions. Looking at the final dis- tribution of the compounds in the 2 compartments (fetal and ma-ternal circuit) after 360 min of the perfusion, we found they allpassed the placental barrier and were distributed in the followingproportions 7.9%). As shown in Table 1S (Supporting In- formation), 11.4 -21.2% of the substance was removed by sam- pling during perfusion, corresponding to one-sixth to one-thirdof the final recovery. In addition, it is crucial to include the results from the 360 min system adherence test (empty perfusion). While only small losses were seen for antipyrine and protopine, considerable amounts of citalopram and diazepam adhered to Fig. 3 The fetal-maternal concentration ratio (FM ratio; fetal concentration divided by maternal concentration) calculated foreach timepoint of protopine (n = 4), citalopram (n = 4), and diaze- pam (n = 5), in comparison with antipyrine (n = 3) from control per- fusions. The FM ratio is 1.0 when the fetal and maternal concentra-tions are equal. All data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation(SD) of at least 3 independent experiments (except t = 300 and 360 min in case of protopine, and t = 360 min in case of antipyrine, in which only 2 values are included).

The final recovery was calculated as the sum of com- pound present in fetal and maternal perfusates at the end of a per- fusion and the amounts sampled during the perfusion from fetaland maternal perfusates. The loss of compound by binding to theperfusion model was accounted for by the system adherence test (empty perfusion). All data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of 3 to 5 independent experiments. 197Spiess D et al. Placental Passage of ...Planta 194 -207 | \u00a9 2022. The author(s). the equipment and tubing after 360 min. Using the system adher- ence test to assess the final recovery, we of placental tissue was as- sessed to account for potential loss of compound in the placentaitself ( Table 2S , Supporting Information). The f u,hom was equal to 1.0 for antipyrine, followed by protopine 0.007). Thus, f u,hom followed the pattern of the system adherence test, reflecting the lipophilicnature of the compounds. The stability of study compounds was tested over 360 min in 3 different matrices (PBS, perfusion medium (PM), and 3 placental homogenates [Donors 1 -3] at 2 temperatures (4\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C). stability data of antipyrine, and citalopram were very comparablein the 2 matrices PBS and PM, while protopine (in PM) anddiazepam (in PBS) were slightly less stable over 360 min at 4 \u00b0Cand 37\u00b0C ( Fig. 6 ). A degradation in homogenate was observed with diazepam (66.7%, 68.3%, and 73.3% respectively).The use of 3 different placental homogenates (donors) resulted in comparable values for all test substances. Differences due to ma- trix effects were excluded in a separate experiment (see Fig. 2S , Supporting Information). The placental perfusion model can not only be used to charac- terize the transplacental compound transfer and investigate thepossible effects of the compounds on placental viability and hor-monal production. All placentae viability and metabolic activitywere constant in our case, as neither glucose consumption nor lactate production was affected by the study compounds ( Fig. 7a ). With antipyrine (from control perfusions, Fig. 3S ,S u p - porting Information), the total glucose consumption and lactateproduction during 360 min were 0.39 with protopine, citalopram, comparable indicating that they did not impairplacental viability and metabolic activity. As an additional mea-sure for ( -hCG) and leptin was determined and ex- pressed as the release rate per min and weight of cotyledon (g)( Fig. 7b ). The tissue of all placentae retained its functionality throughout the ex vivo perfusion period. A -hCG production of 95.7 mU/g/min and leptin production of 334.8 pg/g/min were ob-served in perfusions with antipyrine (from control perfu-sions, Fig. 3S , Supporting Information). Protopine did not inhibit -hCG and leptin production in a statistically significant way, even though leptin production was somewhat lower in the presence of all study compounds. To establish the human ex vivo placental perfusion model, we introduced a detailed histopathological examination of the per-fused tissue. Representative macroscopic and microscopic imagesof the transition between perfused and nonperfused tissue, anddetails of the perfused area and an individual villus with an outerlayer of trophoblast cells are shown ( Fig. 8 ). The most important histopathological criteria for quality control (QC) were: (i) macroscopically, an evident effect of the perfusion on thecotyledon, in contrast to the nonperfused tissue ( Fig. 8a ); microscopically, (ii) a difference between perfused and nonper-fused tissue, the latter being characterized by a narrow intervil-lous space and blood-filled capillaries ( Fig. 8b ); (iii) the perfused area had dilated intervillous space, bloodless capillaries, and regu-lar (mature) villi ( Fig. 8c ); and (iv) the proportion of vacuolated (degenerated) trophoblast cells was between 0 -20% ( Fig. 8d ). Fig. 6 Stability data of study compounds ( a-d)e x p r e s s e da sa percentage (%) of the initial concentration (C0) in PBS. The stabilitytest was performed for 360 min at 2 different temperatures (4 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C) and 3 different matrices (PBS, perfusion medium (PM), and placental homogenates from 3 different donors). Differencesdue to matrix effects were excluded in a separate experiment (seeFig. 2S , Supporting Information). Samples were processed via solid phase extraction or protein precipitation before analysis. All data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). 198Spiess D et al.

The Initial histopathological examinations showed that, in our hands, perfusion was effectively taking place and did not seriously dam- age the perfused cotyledon. These examinations were then per-formed after every perfusion experiment with study compoundsto demonstrate successful perfusion (including connection of thefetal and maternal perfused area) and assess possible deleteriouseffects of the compound on the tissue compared to nonperfusedtissue. The histopathological evaluation of the placental specimens showed that the only macroscopically discernible effect of the perfusion was the pale tissue, which was apparent in all placentae.In all cases, the microscopic examination ( Table 1 ) of the tissue sections revealed a clear transition between perfused and nonper- fused tissue. The villous vessels of the perfused side were 80% empty (the nonperfused area was 90% blood-filled) and mostly dilated. The intervillous spaces of the perfused tissue were also95% bloodless (the nonperfused area was 50% blood-filled) and mostly dilated (40 -80%), in contrast to the nonperfused side (10-40%). Hydropic villous changes were found more often in perfused (5 -15%) than in nonperfused areas (0 -1%). Histopatho- logical examinations showed that the endothelium in perfusedand nonperfused tissue was still viable after 360 min of perfusion.There were also no ruptures of villous vessels or extravasation intovillous stroma in perfused and nonperfused ar eas. In addition, no thrombi could be detected in vessels of stem villi. The percentage of thrombi in villous vessels (0% or 1%) was the same in perfused and control tissue (nonperfused), whereas 2 cotyledons perfusedwith protopine showed a slightly higher proportion of to control (5% vs. 1%). Trophoblast vacuoliza- tion in the perfused areas occurred in a small proportion of 0 - 20%. Overall, protopine did not cause apparent damage ofplacental tissue according to the assessment of endothelium, vas-cular rupture, thrombi, and trophoblast vacuolization. In addition,no signs of inflammation were found in any of the perfused areasof the placentae examined, as neither bacteria nor neutrophilswere present in the villous vessels and intervillous spaces. The assessment of global placental pathology was also inconspicuous, with no signs of fetal or maternal malperfusion, an absence of vil-lous immaturity, chronic/acute villitis, chronic deciduitis and cho-rioamnionitis, and no bacteria in the nonperfused area of theplacenta. Discussion The present data show that protopine was rapidly transferredfrom the maternal to the fetal circuit, and no evidence formetabolization was found. However, the FM ratio of protopinewas lower than that of antipyrine (0.75 vs. 0.96), and no equilibri-um between maternal and fetal concentrations was reached. Thisfinding was similar to the results obtained with citalopram.Whether the absence of an equilibrium is due to active transpla-cental transport of protopine deserves further investigation. In our experiments, the transplacental transfer of antipyrine, citalo-Table 1 Detailed histopathological evaluation assessing the microscopic effects of human ex vivo placental perfusions with protopine (n = 4), and the damage of placental tissue in perfused areas compared to nonperfused areas.

The use of placental perfusion and U(H)PLC MS/MS methods are strengths of the present work. Placental perfusion is the goldstandard when studying the transfer of compounds from themother to the fetus. A limitation of this model is that substancetransfer at term may be overestimated compared to that in thepremature placenta of early pregnancy [28]; in addition, the model cannot mimic the mother s drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Only U(H)PLC MS/MS methods to de- tect very low concentrations enabled the work on this project,since clinically relevant concentrations of phytochemicals from(multicomponent) extracts are known/expected to be very low. Ex vivo placental perfusions allow determining the transfer of study compounds and assessing placental viability and function.Control perfusions with antipyrine showed similar values for the placental viability (glucose consumption, lactate production) and functionality ( -hCG and leptin production) as previously reported for this model [32]. None of the study compounds altered the glu-cose consumption, lactate production, and -hCG accumulation, and only a statistically nonsignificant decr ease in leptin produc- tion was observed. These results indicated that none of the com-pounds impaired placental performance. The histopathologicalevaluation of perfused tissues (cotyledons) was in line with these results. No pathological findings were observed, and all placental specimens showed only unremarkable, age-appropriate paren-chymal maturation. Trophoblastic vacuolization villi was theonly perfusion-induced change observed. Despite the ischaemicperiods up to 60 min, no increase in damage of placental tissuecould be observed with time ( Table 1 andTable 3S , Supporting Information). vessels northe vacuolization of trophoblasts in villi was increased. It was crucial to calculate the recovery of study comp ounds in the best possible way to validate the findings. The amounts in thefetal and maternal compartments, the amounts removed by sam-pling, and the loss due to adsorption in the maternal circuit couldbe considered. Study compounds may also be taken up by cells/membranes and may be metabolized by placental enzymes. Tominimize adsorption to the perfusion system, we used only tubesrecommended for pharmaceutical and medical applications, and we shortened the tubing in the model. Moreover, in placental homogenates, fraction unbound, and stability of compoundswere determined. Nevertheless, the calculated recoveries arelikely to be underestimated, given that adsorption in the fetal cir-cuit could not be measured. To further assess safety of California poppy during pregnancy, transplacental passage of additional phytochemicals have to beinvestigated, together with testing in additional models. We are currently using a range of in vitro assays to characterize cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, and the influence on metabolic and differ-entiation processes of whole extracts [39] and protopine (Spiesset al., manuscript under review). From a safety perspective, theseresults will be particularly relevant for compounds that can crossthe placental barrier and, therefore, have access to the fetal circu-lation, as is the case for protopine. In addition, we are investigat-ing the intestinal and hepatic of several phyto- chemicals.The human placental ex vivo perfusion model was successfully implemented and used for the first time with a phytochemical.The ex vivo placental perfusion model will now be used also for transport studies with relevant phytochemicals in other medicinalplants used for the treatment of mild NMDs in pregnancy.

Placentae were collected in collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics of the University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland. Only placentae from women undergoing elective caesarean section from uncomplicated term pregnancies(37-41 wk) were considered. Each pregnant woman signed in- formed written consent before delivery for the use of placentaefor research. This procedure (including consent form) was ap-proved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich (KEK-StV73 Nr. 07/07; March 21, 2007). Exclusion criteria included:twin and/or complicated pregnancy, smoking, substance abuse, and patients positive for HIV, HBV and SARS CoV2. Equipment and experimental procedure of perfusion. A slightly modified ex vivo human placental perfusion model [32, 38] was used to study the transfer of the study compounds acrossthe placental barrier ( Fig. 9 ). A cotyledon of placenta (lobule) was perfused with 2 reconstructed circuits representingthe maternal and fetal sides. Both sides consisted of an arterytransporting the perfusate to the cotyledon and a vein that re- turns the perfusate to the original reservoir. Two heating mag- netic stirrers were added to ensure physiological conditions andto prevent uneven distribution of study compounds. The time course of a perfusion experiment, including the pre- paratory phases, checkpoints and samplings is shown in Fig. 10 . After obtaining a suitable placenta (checkpoint 1), the fetal arteryand associated vein of a selected cotyledon were cannulated andmounted in a perfusion chamber within 60 min after delivery. The selection of a suitable cotyledon for perfusion was based on a thorough visual examination of the villous structures and associ-ated fetal vessels. Cotyledons with a ragged maternal surface(visible disruptions; macroscopic tissue trauma), evidence of basalplate fibrin deposition (on the maternal surface), suspectedplacental infarction, or too little fetal membrane (on the disk ofthe placenta) were not considered for perfusion. The chorionicartery was cannulated ( 1.2 ( 1.5-1.8 mm cannula). A surgical 194 -207 | \u00a9 2022. The Overview of the ex vivo human placental perfusion with checkpoints for a successful experiment. Checkpoint 1 involved obtaining a suitable placenta, written informed consent from the donor, and ensuring that no exclusion criteria were present. The quality of placental tissue and presence of fetal vessels suitable for cannulation were checked. After cannulation, it is important to verify free flow of perfusion medium (PM) through the fetal vessels (checkpoint 2), leading to a 20 min open preliminary (pre-) phase (nonrecirculating), followed by a 20 min closed pre-phase (recirculating). During the latter, the volumes of maternal and fetal perfusates have to remain stable in order to begin the main experiment(checkpoint 3). The main experiment started with circulating PM containing the connectivity control (antipyrine) and study compound at the de- sired concentration ( denoting the experiment s beginning and end). At defined timepoints (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min), samples were taken from the maternal and fetal reservoir for analysis. At the beginning of the experiment and after each hour, the pHand the fetal-maternal (FM) leak were measured. Fig. 9 Placental perfusion setup consisting of maternal (left) and fetal (right) circuit.

The fetal perfusate was gassed with 95% N 2/5% CO 2throughout with 95% air/5%CO 2instead. The perfusion included a 20 min open preliminary (pre-) phase with nonrecirculating PM (with discarded venousoutflow) to allow the placental tissue to recover from the ische-mic period after the delivery and to flush out the remainingblood from the villous vasculature and intervillous space (check- point 2). In the following recirculating closed pre-phase (20 min; with the venous outflow leading back to the corresponding reser-voir), the perfusate volumes on the maternal and fetal sides weremonitored. Stability of volumes (50 mL PM in each reservoir) en-sured the integrity of the circuits and the absence of leaking inthe fetal-to-maternal circuit (checkpoint 3). The main experimentwas then initiated by replacing the fetal and maternal perfusatesimultaneously with equal starting volumes of 100 mL fresh PM, with the addition of the study compound and antipyrine (as a con- nectivity control) to the perfusate of the maternal circuit, both ata final concentration of 5 \u00b5M diaze-pam). In both reservoirs, the pH was adjusted to a physiologicalrange (7.3 \u00b1 0.1) at the beginning of the experiment (and ad-justed after every hour of perfusion), and the fetal-maternal (FM)leak was not allowed to exceed a value of 4 mL/h (checkpoint 4). Samples (3 -4 mL) for analysis were taken at defined timepoints over a 360 min period (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300,and 360 min). Samples were stored at 80 \u00b0C for bioanalytical analysis in 0.8 mL glass micro-inserts (VWR) immediately aftercentrifugation at 800 rpm/1837 rcf (Centrifuge Sigma 6 -16; 4\u00b0C, 10 min) to remove residual erythrocytes. Additional QC measuresincluded a fetal perfusion pressure 70 mmHg throughout the perfusion and an antipyrine equilibrium between fetal and mater- nal circuit after 240 -360 min. For an overview of the experimental conditions and characteristics of the placentae used see Table 3S (Supporting Information). Fetal capillary integrity ma rker analysis. For establishing and validating the ex vivo placental perfusion model, initial (40 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich) as a test substance assessingthe integrity of fetal capillaries ( Fig. 4S , Supporting Information). FITC-dextran was added to the fetal circuit at a final concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL. The concentration in the fetal and maternal sam-ples was detected by a Cytation added toblack MaxiSorp microtiter plates. Perfusion system adherence test (empty perfusion). Before starting the perfusions with human placentae, a system adher- ence test (circuit of study compounds through an empty perfu-sion chamber comprising only the maternal circuit) was per- formed for a total of 360 min. This test was used to assess the dis-solution and adherence of new, yet unknown, compounds to theperfusion equipment and mainly to the tubing system to evaluatethe final recovery better. Study comp ounds were, therefore, di- rectly dissolved in PM at a final concentration of 5 \u00b5M. All studycompounds were tested individually in 3 independent experi-m e n t s( n=3 ) . Viability and functionality of placental tissue. We measured glucose and lactate concentration in fetal and maternal samplesat the beginning and end of every perfusion. This was done to de-termine the glucose consumption and lactate productionthroughout a perfusion as indicators of tissue viability and meta-bolic activity using an automated blood gas system (ABL800FLEX). The production of 2 placental hormones --hCG and leptin -was monitored to assess tissue functionality ex vivo by standard ELISA as described previously by Malek et al. [40, 41]. The only de- viation following the protocol was the use of a solutionconsisting of 1% BSA instead of 2% BSA. Histopathological evaluation. Each placental specimen was pathologically examined as an additional QC. For this purpose,representative tissue sections -each from the perfused and non- perfused placental portion, and from the transitional area -were removed immediately after each perfusion, fixed in 4% para- formaldehyde for at least 24 h, and then processed according to the standards of routine histopathological diagnosis of the De-partment of Pathology and Molecular Pathology (University Hos-pital of Zurich). Briefly, the fixed tissue sections were embeddedin paraffin, cut into 2 -3 \u00b5m thick sections, then stained with stan- dard hematoxylin and eosin stain and with a modified Gram stain(according to Braun-Brenn). The latter was used to test for bacte-rial contamination in the perfused area [42]. Tissue from the non- perfused specimens was examined for general placental patholo- gies described in routine diagnostics [43, 44]. The quality of per-fusion was correlated based on the blood void and width of theintervillous (maternal) space and fetal blood vessels in the cho-rionic villi, with particular attention to the presence of intravascu-lar thrombi. To test whether tissue damage might have occurreddue to perfusion, we sought and compared general signs of de-generation such as vacuolization of the cytotrophoblast, the via- bility endothelium, and the formation of hydropic villous changes with the tissue condition of the nonper-fused area. All microscopic effects studied and damage toplacental tissue in the perfused area are reported in relativeamounts (% of total). LCMS/MS analysis Instrument and chromatographic conditions.

Desolvation andnebulization gas was nitrogen. The autosampler temperaturewas set at 10\u00b0C, and the column temperature at 45\u00b0C. MS/MS data were analyzed with MassLynx software version 4.1. U(H)PLC gradients, internal standards, and MRM transitions can be foundinTable 4S and5S(Supporting Information). Standards and stock solutions. Stock solutions (SS) of the an- alytes and the ISs were prepared at 0.2 -1 mg/mL. Working solu- tions (WS1) for antipyrine, and 100 \u00b5g/mL for all other compounds in DMSO) and of the ISs (50 \u00b5g/mL inMeOH) were obtained by dilution of the corresponding SSs. Cali- bration samples (Cals) of the analytes within the 5 - ng/mL (QCL), me-dium (QCM), and high (QCH) levels were obtained from serial di-lutions of the WS in the corresponding matrix (PM). The concen-trations of the QCs were defined as (i) 3-fold the lowest concen-tration for QCL; (ii) the highest concentration divided by 2 forQCM; and (iii) 80% of the highest concentration for QCH. All SSs were stored at 80 \u00b0C. Cals and QCs were freshly prepared before analysis. Before each experiment, a second working solution(WS2) of the IS was prepared by further diluting the WS1 inMeOH. Details for the calibration curves can be found in Fig. 5S - 8S(Supporting Information) and in Tables 6S -9S(Supporting In- formation). Sample extraction in placental perfusion medium anti- pyrine, diazepam, citalopram, and protopine. To 200 \u00b5L of the analyte in the PM were added 100 \u00b5L of the IS, 200 \u00b5L BSA (60 g/ L), and 800 \u00b5L ice (1000 \u00b5L for antipyrine). The mixturewas briefly vortexed at room temperature on an Eppendorf Ther-momixer (1400 rpm) and finally centrifuged for gas flow (Evaporex Reconstitution was done with 200 \u00b5L of 65% mobile phase A (purified water with 5% MeCN and 0.1% formic acid; in the and 35% mobilephase B (MeCN with acid) followed by 45 min shakingon the Eppendorf MixMate. The injection was done in full loopmode (2 \u00b5L) from the 96-DWP. Method qualification. The bioanalytical fit-for-purpose meth- ods had been developed and qualified only based on some val- idation tests (within- and between-series imprecision and inaccu- racy, as well as carry-over had been assessed to validate the meth-ods), following the current guidelines for industry [45, 46]. Within- and between-series injected into the U(H)PLC MS/ MS. Three validation runs on 3 different days were performed to ensure reproducibility. In each run, the imprecision (CV%) of eachQC series had to be below 15% (20% for LLOQ) within the series. The inaccuracy (RE%) had to be within \u00b1 15% of the nominal val-ues (\u00b1 20% at After these 3 runs, CV% and RE% werecalculated between the series by determining the overall mean \u00b1standard deviation (SD) for each QC level. The acceptance criteriawere the same as for within-series acceptance criteria. Additionalinformation on quality control can be found in Tables 10S -13S (Supporting Information). Carry-over. The carry-over of analyte and IS in each analytical run was determined by injecting a blank sample immediately afterULOQ in both sets of calibrators. The mean carry-over in the blanksample from the 2 calibrators sets should not exceed 20% of thesignal of the LLOQ for the analyte and 5% for the IS [46]. Details ofthe carry-over assessment of all study compounds can be found inTables 14S -17S(Supporting Information). Recovery/mass balance of study compounds in the placental perfusion system The final recovery of each study comp ound after the perfusion was calculated with the following equations (Eqs. 1 VM/F/S is maternal/fetal/sample volume (mL), t 0and t endare the beginning and end of the perfusion. The final recovery (%) is the sum of amount of study compound in maternal and fetal perfu- sates at the end of a perfusion, and samples (S) collected in rela-tion to the initial amount of study compound measured in thematernal perfusate, including the mean amount adhered from3 system adherence tests (empty perfusion, EP, in %).

Ac- cording to manufacturer s instructions, 200 \u00b5L of the spiked ho- mogenates were added to the donor chamber, and 350 \u00b5L ofblank buffer were added to the receiver chamber. Samples werecollected after equilibration (240 min on an orbital shaker at600 rpm, 37 \u00b0C). Samples were analyzed by U(H)PLC MS/MS. Frac- tion unbound was calculated as follows [47]: Diluted f u;d\u00bcReceiver Area Ratio Donor Area Ratio(3) and Undiluted f u\u00bc1=D \u00f01=fu;d1\u00de\u00fe 1=D(4) where D is the dilution factor of 5 as stated above. Stability of compounds in placental homogenate. The stabili- ty of the compounds was assessed over 360 min (to match the time of placental perfusion experiments) in PBS, PM, andplacental homogenates. Homogenates spiked with study com-pounds were prepared as described above. After compound spik-ing in the different matrixes, samples were either immediatelyprocessed for U(H)PLC MS/MS analysis (C0) or kept at 4 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C for 360 min on an orbital shaker (600 rpm) before pro-cessing for U(H)PLC MS/MS analysis. Stability was expressed as follows [47]: Stability as %remaining \u00bc (5) Area Ratio at 4/C14Co r3 7/C14Ca t6 h Area Ratio at C0/C2100% Data processing and calculations Concentrations in placental perfusion profiles ( Fig. 2 ) and sys- tem adherence ( Fig. 4 ) are expressed as a percentage (%) of ini- tial analyzed concentration in the maternal sample at the begin-ning of the perfusion. Note that the recovery values were calcu- lated differently (see Eqs. 1 and 2). The FM ratio (Eq. 6; Fig. 3 ) was calculated for each point and plotted against the perfusion time (min). Glucose consumption(Eq. 7) and lactate production (Eq. 8) are displayed as the sum ofchanges (from the perfusion beginning [t 0]t ot h ee n d[ t end]) of total content (\u00b5mol) in both fetal and maternal circuits, normal-ized by the total perfusion time (min) and perfused cotyledonweight (W cot; g). The net release rate of placental hormones - hCG (mU) and leptin (pg) (Eq. 9) during the placental perfusion was normalized by the total perfusion time (min) and perfused co-tyledon weight (g) as well. FM ratio ;t\u00bcCF;t Statistical analysis For glucose consumption, lactate production, -hCG, and leptin production, multiple group comparisons were performed usingthe Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests, followed by the Dun-nett s T3 multiple comparisons posthoc test (with individual GraphPad Software).

Establishment and validation of the human ex vivo placental perfusion model. Assessment the suitability of (FITC) -dextran (40 kDa) as a fetal capillary integrity marker when added to the fetal circuit at a concentration of 200 g/mL. (A) A representative perfusion profile without a transfer of fluorescence (FITC -dextran) from the fetal to the maternal side occurs when the following two conditions were met: (B) the measured fetal volume corresponded to the calculated volume and a fetal - maternal (FM) leak of 4 mL/h was not exceeded. (C) A representative profile with a FITC -dextran transfer into the maternal circuit, if these conditions were violated: ( D) the course of measured fetal volume in the corresponding perfusion deviated from the calculated volume, indicative of FM leaks (e.g. 8 mL/h at 240 min). A tracking of fetal and maternal volumes was therefore considered an adequate indicator for FM leaks, and no FITC -dextran was added in the subsequent placental perfusions.

Phytomedicines fromSt. John's wort and valerian are valid candidates, but safety data in pregnancy are lacking. The transplacental transport of hyperforin and hypericin (from St. John's wort), and valerenic acid (from valerian) was evaluated using the ex vivo cotyledon perfusion model (4 h perf usions, term placentae) part, the in vitro Transwell assay with BeWo b30 cells. Antipyrine was used for comparison in both models. U(H)PLC -MS/MS bioanalytical methods were developed to quantify the compounds. Perfusion data obtained with term place ntae showed that only minor amounts of hyperforin passed into the fetal circuit, while hypericin did not cross the placental barrier and valerenic acid equilibrated between the maternal and fetal compartments. None of the investigated compounds affected me tabolic, functional, and histopathological parameters of the placenta during the perfusion experiments. Data from the Transwell model suggested that valerenic acid does not cross the placental cell layer. Taken together, our data suggest that throughout th e pregnancy the potential fetal exposure to hypericin and hyperforin - but not to valerenic acid - is likely to be minimal.

Studies from various countries (e.g., low-middle-i ncome countries, Uni ted States, Sweden), reported a prevalence of 14% -20% for psychiatric diseases in pregnancy ( Andersson et al., 2003 ;Marcus et al., 2003 ;Fisher et al., 2012 ).

Moreover, a Swiss cross-sectional survey revealed that more than 52.0% of the participants sufferedfrom mental disorders and/or symptoms during pregnancy butonly a few (1.6%) took synthetic psychoactive medications(Gantner et al., 2021 ). Mental disorders like mild depression, sleep disorders, and anxiety can lead to complications like preterm birth if left untreated ( Dunkel Schetter, 2011 ). However, most synthetic drugs may not only cause side effectsin the mother, but also cross the placental barrier and reach thefetus. Concerns on tolerability, teratogenicity and impact onneonatal outcomes exist and are, in part, supported by variousstudies ( Sivojelezova et al., 2005 ;Rahimi et al., 2006 ;Grigoriadis et al., 2014 ;Yonkers et al., 2014 ;Gao et al., 2018 ). Pregnant women in need of medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S SRIs) and benzodiazepines therefore face the dilemma of either using or refraining from using them. Phytomedicines are popular alternatives to synthetic medications. Many pregnant wo men use herbal medicines, in addition to or rather than synt hetic drugs, probably as they p e r c e i v et h o s ea l t e r n a t i v e st ob et h es a f e rc h o i c ef o rt h e i ru n b o r nchild ( Sarecka-Hujar and Szulc-Musiol, 2022 ). A recent Swiss survey revealed that 89.9% of pregnant women are using some type of herbal medicine ( Gantner et al., 2021 ). Some healthcare professionals also tend to recommend phytomedicines and,hence, contribute to the trust in these products ( Stewart et al., 2014 ). Most phytomedicines are available without prescription. In general, safety data for use during pregnancyare lacking for phytomedicines ( Bernstein et al., 2021 ;Morehead and McInnis, 2021 ) .F o re x a m p l e ,i ti sn o tk n o w nw h e t h e r pharmacologically active compounds in these products can cross the placental barrier. Given the lack of data, theagencies responsible for approval of drugs require a warninglabel in the patient information of these products. In the treatment of mild to mo derate depression, St. John 's wort ( Hypericum perforatum L., Hypericaceae) is an alternative to SSRIs, as the clinical ef cacy has been documented in several clinical trials ( Linde et al., 2008 ). Hyperforin and hypericin are two characteristic compounds in St. John 's wort. They have been shown to possess variou s CNS-related pharmacological activities but are not solely responsible for the antidepressant properties.As for most other phytomedicines, the entire extract has to beconsidered as the active ingredient ( Butterweck and Schmidt, 2007 ;Nicolussi et al., 2020 ). A recent study based on data from Germany found that pregnant women mainly used St. John 's wort in the rst trimester, but simultaneous dispensation of other d r u g st h a tf a v o u ri n t e r a c t i o n sa n d the observation of a relatively high rate of non-live births call for a thorough further safety investigation ( Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2021 ). Valerian (Valeriana of its sleep promoting andanxiolytic properties ( Hattesohl et al., 2008 ). Valerenic acid, a characteristic compound in valeri an, is an allosteric modulator of GABA Areceptors ( Becker et al., 2014 ), but again is not solely responsible for the clinical ef cacy of phytomedicines containing valerian extracts. Valerian is favoured by many expecting mothers, as shown in a multinational study where valerianwas among the ve most frequently used herbal medicines (Kennedy et al., 2013 ). St. John 's wort and valerian have been used for decades in Europe and have been labelled with \"well established use \"and \"traditional use \", respectively, by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) of theEuropean Medicines Age ncy (EMA). However, they recommend neither of the herbs to be used during pregnancy due to insuf cient toxicological data ( European Medicines 2021 ). Relevant toxicological aspec ts in the context of pregnancy include effects on placental function and on transplacentaltransfer. The human placenta develops during pregnancy, ateach gestational stage supplying the developing fetus withblood, nutrients, and oxygen, while also regulating the removal of waste products and carbon dioxide. In addition, it metabolises substances and releases hormones that in fluence the course of pregnancy, fetal metabolism and growth, and labouritself ( Gude et al., 2004 ). The placenta also protects the fetus from infections, maternal d iseases, and some xenobiotics including drugs. Most drugs pass t hrough the placenta viapassive or simple diffusion that is in fluenced by factors such as molecular weight (MW), degree of ionization, lipi d solubility, protein binding, concentration gradient of the drug across the placenta, placental surface area/thickness, pH of maternal and fetalblood, and placental metabolism ( van der Aa et al., 1998 ; Syme et al., 2004 ;Tetro et al., 2018 ). Other processes of drug transfer across the placenta inclu de facilitated diffusion, active transport, and endocytosis. Once formed, the placentalsyncytiotrophoblast is the rate-limiting barrier separating thematernal and fetal circulation, with various transporters and enzymes located at the apical and basolateral membranes (Desforges and Sibley, 2010 ;Al-Enazy 2017 Prior to their formation, a monolayer of precursor cells(cytotrophoblasts) held togeth er by tight junctions exerts the b a r r i e rf u n c t i o n( Prouillac and Lecoeur, 2010 ). Data on transplacental passage of dr ugs can be obtained using the ex vivo human placental perfusion model (with term placentae) representative of the late stage of pregnancy ( Myllynen and Vahakangas, 2013 ). It is considered to be the gold-standard among placental transfer models ( Panigel et al., 1967 ;Malek et al., 2009 ;Grafmuller et al., 2013 ), and we have recently shown its usefulness for studying the transplacental transfer ofphytochemicals ( Spiess monolayers of con fluent, human, non- differentiated placental cells, on the other hand, re flect the transfer through a continuous layer of cytotrophoblasts ( Bode et al., 2006 ;V\u00e4h\u00e4kangas and Myllynen, 2006 ;Prouillac and Lecoeur, 2010 ). In the present study, we investigated the transplacental passage of hyperforin, hypericin, and valerenic acid ( ) using the ex vivo term placental perfusion model. In this model, we also investigated their effects on metabolic, functional, andhistopathological properties o f placental tissue. In case of valerenic acid, an in vitro Transwell model based on the human placental BeWo b30 cell line ( Li et al., 2013 )w a su s e d in addition. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 02Spiess et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1123194Materials and methods Chemicals, reagents, and study compounds All solvents were of UPLC grade. Acetonitrile (MeCN) was purchased from Merck. Methanol was from Avantor Performance Materials Poland. Puri ed water was obtained from a Milli-Q integral water puri cation system. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) hyperforin PhytoLab, and hypericin was fromCarbosynth. Warfarin was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, digoxin Sigma-Aldrich. Ex vivo human placental perfusion Placentae collection Placentae were collected with informed written consent from women with uncomplicated term pregnancies immediately after undergoing primary caesarean section. This procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich(KEK-StV73 Nr. 07/07; 21 March 2007). All research wasperformed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki andother relevant guidelines/regulations. All placentae were veri ed to be negative for HIV, HBV, SARS-CoV-2, and twin pregnancydonors were not included in the study. Placentae with a raggedmaternal surface (visible disruptions; macroscopic tissue trauma), evidence of basal plate brin deposition, suspected placental infarction or too little fetal membrane (on the disk of theplacenta) were not considered for perfusion. Supplementary Table S2 gives an overview of the experimental conditions and characteristics of all placentae used: a total of 11 placentae (donatedby 11 women) were suitable for perfusion, 3-4 individual placentaewere used for each test substance. Equipment and experimental procedure of perfusion Theex vivo human placental perfusion model was adapted from the models of Schneider ( Schneider, 1972 ) and Grafm\u00fcller(Grafmuller et al., 2013 ), and has been described in detail ( Spiess et al., 2022a ). In brief, a was perfused by of the chorionic andcorresponding vein. Three blunt cannulae were inserted into theintervillous space to reconstruct the maternal circuit and to allow thetransplacental exchange through the perfusion medium (PM). The PM consisted of Earle 's buffer (1 part), cell culture medium 199 (2 parts; Sigma-Aldrich), and supplements 95% N 2/5% CO 2, and the maternal perfusate with 95% air/5% CO 2instead. Two heating magnetic stirrers ensured a constant distribution of study compounds in both reservoirs. Aphysiological temperature of 37 \u00b0C was maintained with flow heaters (heating columns) and a water bath. Digitally controlled peristaltic pumps (Ismatec) transported the fetal and maternal perfusates at a rate of 3 and 12 mL/min, respectively. The perfusion experiment,including a 20 min non-recirculating (open) and a 20 minrecirculating (closed) preparatory phase, started with equalvolumes of 100 mL fresh PM. The study compound andantipyrine were added to the perfusate of the maternal circuit,both at a nal concentration of 172 ng/mL valerenic acid). The dissolution and adherence of the compounds to the perfusion equipment and to the tubing system was assessedbefore starting perfusions with human placentae. All studycompounds were pumped over a period of 240 min through anempty (i.e., in the absence of placental tissue) perfusion chambercomprising only the maternal circuit. The compounds were directlydissolved in PM at a nal concentration of 5 M (100 mL reservoir) and individually tested in three independent experiments (n = 3). Sample preparation and quality controls Antipyrine served as connectivity (positive) control in all placental perfusions to verify the overlap of the maternal and thefetal circulation. The stability of volumes in each reservoir ensuredthe integrity of the circuits and served for the detection of fetal-maternal (FM) leaks ( 4 mL/h). Throughout the perfusion additional quality control measures included a physiological pH- range (7.2 \u00b1 0.1) and a controlled fetal perfusion pressure(70 mmHg). Samples were taken at de ned timepoints over a 240 min period, immediately centrifuged, and stored in glass FIGURE 1 Chemical structures of investigated phytochemicals and antipyrine. Frontiers in Pharmacology (VWR) at 80\u00b0C for bioanalytical analysis. A blood gas analysis (pH, pO2,pCO 2, glucose, lactate; ABL800 FLEX) of fetal and maternal samples was performed to ensure viabilityand metabolic activity of placental tissue ( -hCG) and leptin was monitored by standard to assess tissue functionality ex vivo [see ( Spiess monoclonal anti-hCG (abcam; 1:5 served secondary hormone hCG (Lucerna-Chem) was usedas reference standard; standard nal concentrations of between 100 mU/mL and 2.5 mU/mL were prepared by serial dilution in seven steps and used in each plate. The goat anti-mouse- IgG-horseradish peroxidase c onjugate (abcam) antibody was used at mouse anti-human leptin/OB (R&D Systems), used at a dilution of 1:1 000. The standard was recombinant human leptin (R&D Systems); standard nal concentrations of between 2 000 pg/mL and 15.6 pg/mL were prepared by serial 1:2 dilution in sevensteps and used in each was 10%, inter- assay CV% was conjugate streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase Associates, 1:4 000) was added and the plate incubated for 60 min. For the development, ready-to-use tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (Thermo Fischer) was used. Histopathological evaluation Immediately after perfusion the placentae were xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 h. Tissue samples fromrepresentative placental tissue sections, each from perfused, non-perfused, and transitional area were prepared to perform a pathological examination. For this purpose, the tissue was embedded in paraf n, cut ( 2-3 \u00b5m), and stained (standard hematoxylin-eosin stain, Braun-Brenn modi ed Gram stain) according to the standards of routine histopathological diagnosisof the Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology(University Hospital of Zurich). The tissue of the non-perfusedspecimens was examined with regard to general placentalpathologies as described in routine diagnostics ( Turowski et al., 2012 ;Khong et al., 2016 ). The blood void and width of the intervillous space and fetal blood vessels in the chorionic villiprovided information about the quality of perfusion, andparticular attention was paid to the presence of intravascularthrombi. General signs of degeneration, such as compared with non-perfused tissue indicated whether tissue damage might have occurred during perfusion. Microscopic effects and placental tissue damage in the perfused area were expressed in relativeamounts (%) to the vitro permeability assay Cell culture BeWo obtained Dr. Tina Buerki-Thurnherr (Empa, St. Gallen, Switzerland), with permissionfrom Dr. Alan L. Schwartz (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis MO, USA), and were cultivated in F-12 K Nut Mix supplemented with 10% mM (all from Gibco). The cells were cultivated ina humidi ed incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2atmosphere. Monolayer formation on cell culture inserts BeWo b30 cells were cultured on Transwell \u00aepolycarbonate format; 0.4 m pore size, apical volume, 1 000L basolateral volume; Corning, Sigma-Aldrich) at a density of 60 000 cells/well. These inserts were then cultivated in a cellZscope (nanoAnalytics) at 37\u00b0C/ 5% CO 2. Cell culture medium was replaced every 2 days up to 11 days to nd the best possible conditions. Evaluation of monolayer formation Measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was used to assess the tightness of a cell-to-cell barrier, and the electricalcapacitance C cl, provided additional information about the properties of the cell layer (e.g., presence of microvilli and othermembrane extrusions). TER and C clvalues were recorded in 15 min time intervals, using a cellZscope \u00ae. TER values were corrected for the surface area ( cm2) and the reference resistance (well with the same lter insert and medium, but absence of cells). Moreover, a permeability assay with sodium fluorescein (NaF) was performed on days 7 -11 (n = 3). The basolateral compartment of a transparent 24-well plate consisted of PBS only (1 000L) while NaF (5 Mi n PBS; 200 L) was added to the apical compartment for 60 min. The control consisted of cell-free inserts (n = 3). Basolateral samples(50L) were directly added to black Nunc MaxiSorp microtiter plates, and concentrations were determined using microplate reader (BioTek Instruments; staining of cells on inserts BeWo b30 cells were stained with fluorescent probes for nuclei and cytoplasm as follows. Cells were xed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Artechemis) for 20 -30 min. Afterwards they were permeabilized and blocked with 0.3% Triton-X-100 (Sigma) in 1% BSA (ThermoScienti c) in PBS (Gibco) for another 20 -30 min at room temperature on a shaker (50 rpm). Then, cells were incubated at room temperature on a shaker (50 rpm) for 4 -6 h, wrapped in tinfoil, with a 1:10 000 solution of 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) and a phalloi 1% BSA/PBS. Cellswere then extensively washed with PBS, and the insert membraneswere embedded between glass cover slides using Mowiol 4 -88 (Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain flat membranes. The images were acquired with a Leica CTR 6000 microscope (Leica Microsystems) and the corresponding Leica BeWo b30 cells were cultured in transparent 24-well plates under the same conditions as mentioned above and transferred tothe cellZscope \u00aeat day 8 to record TER and C clvalues. After 24 h (day 9) and when a TER of 30 -60cm2was reached and C clwas between 0.5 and 5.0 F/cm2, the permeability assay was initiated by adding valerenic acid M; in HBSS with 4% BSA) to apical compartment, while the basolateral compartment contained1000L of HBSS only. In addition, antipyrine (5 M) was added along with the test substance as a control. Samples(150 La p i c a l ,8 0 0 L basolateral) were collected at each time point (0, 15, 30, 60 min; one insert per time point). After 60 min, apart of the inserts was transferred back to the cellZscope \u00aeto monitor TER and C clvalues during another 24 h. The cells grown on the other part of the inserts were quickly washed with 200 Lo fc o l dH B S Sa n dt h e nl y s e dw i t h7 0 0 L acetonitrile (100 La p i c a l ,6 0 0 L basolateral) for 40 min on an orbital shaker (450 rpm, room temp erature) to determine the test substance cell contents. Calculation of permeability coef cients and recovery Apparent permeability coef cients (P app) were calculated according to the Eq. 1: Pappcm/s () /equalsQ/slashbigt AC A0(1) where Q/t is the rate of amount transported to the receiver compartment, Ais the membrane surface area (0.33 cm2), and CA0is the initial concentration in the apical compartment.

Desolvation and nebulization gas was nitrogen,and collision gas was argon. Flow rate for analysis of all compounds was 0.4 mL/min. The column used was an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (1.7 m; 50 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm) (Waters). The autosampler temperature was set at 10 \u00b0C, and the column temperature at 55\u00b0C. The mobile phase consisted of puri ed water containing 0.1% NH 4OH at pH 10.7 and 0.1% NH 4OH (B2). U(H)PLCTABLE 1 ESI-MS conditions for the analysis of test compounds. Compound Range (ng/mL) MRM transitions analysis of antipyrine, hyperforin, hypericin, and valerenic acid are given in Supplementary Table S3 (Supplementary Material ). MS/MS data were analyzed with MassLynx software version 4.1 (Agilent). Standards and stock solutions Stock solutions of analytes and IS ( Table 1 ) were prepared as previously described ( Spiess et al., 2022a ). Details for the calibrationcurves can be found in Supplementary Figures S8 -S11 (Supplementary Material ) and in Supplementary Tables S4 -S15 (Supplementary Material ). Sample extraction in placenta perfusion for antipyrine, hypericin, and valerenic acid To 200 \u00b5L of analyte in PM were added 100 \u00b5L of the IS solution, 200 \u00b5L of 6% BSA in water, and 800 \u00b5L MeCN (1 000 \u00b5L for antipyrine). The samples were mixed for 10 min at room temperature on an Eppendorf Thermomixer (1 400 rpm), and nally centrifuged at 10\u00b0C for 20 min at 13 200 rpm/16 100 rcf (Centrifuge 5415 R, Eppendorf). An aliquot 100 \u00b5L (1 300 \u00b5L for antipyrine) supernatant was collected and transferred into a 96-deepwell plate (96-DPW, Biotage) and dried under nitrogen gas flow (Evaporex EVX-96, Apricot Designs). Samples were redissolvedwith 200 \u00b5L of a mixture of A2 and B2 (65:35), followed by 45 min of shaking on an Eppendorf MixMate. Antipyrine was redissolved with 200 \u00b5L of A1 and B1 (65:35). Injection was donein full loop mode (2 \u00b5L) from the 96-DWP. Sample extraction in placenta perfusion medium for hyperforin 150L of the IS in MeOH were added to 50 \u00b5L of sample. After centrifugation at 10\u00b0C for 20 min at 13 200 rpm/16 100 rcf (Centrifuge 5415R, Eppendorf), 50 \u00b5L transferred into HPLC vials.

Stability assay in placental homogenate The stability of hyperforin, hypericin, and valerenic acid was assessed in PBS, PM homogenates (preparedaccording to ( Spiess et al., 2022a )) over a period of 360 min, as previously published ( Riccardi et al., 2020 )). In short, after spiking the various matrices with the study compounds, samples were either processed immediately for U(H)PLC-MS/MS analysis (C0), or keptat 4 \u00b0C/37\u00b0C on an orbital shaker (600 rpm) for 360 min before processing for U(H)PLC-MS/MS analysis. Samples wereprocessed viasolid phase extraction or protein precipitation prior to analysis. Data processing and calculations Concentrations in the placental perfusion pro les (Figure 2 ) and system adherence tests ( Figure 4 ) were expressed as a percentage (%) of the maternal concentration at the beginning of the perfusion,whereby the maternal concentration, measured in the maternalreservoir, was adjusted to the total volume of the full maternalcircuit (maternal reservoir and dead volume of the system). The FM concentration ratio (FM ratio; Figure 3 ) was calculated for each timepoint and plotted against the perfusion time (min). The nal recovery (%) is the sum of the amounts of study compound presentin both perfusates at the end of a perfusion, and the sample removedduring the experiment. Glucose consumption and lactateproduction are presented as the sum of changes (from thebeginning to the end of perfusion) in total content ( mol) in both circuits, normali zed by total perfusion time (min) and weight (g) of perfused cotyledon. The net release rate of placental and leptin (ng) -during the placental was also normalized time (min) (see(Spiess et al., 2022b ) for equations).Statistical data analysis Multiple group comparisons we re performed for the glucose consumption, lactate production, -hCG and leptin production using the non-parametric were considere d statistically signi cant. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of three to four independent experiments. Results In silico predictions of physichochemical properties of the test substances Hyperforin, hypericin and valerenic acid ( Figure 1 ) exhibit rather differing physicochemical properties ( Table 2 ), as determined both MWs that aremarkedly higher than that of valerenic acid (and the positive controlantipyrine). Hyperforin and hypericin are predicted to be substantiallymore lipophilic than valerenic acid, which in turn is more lipophilicthan the positive control antipyrine, as re flected by the cLogD pH7.2 values ( Table 2 ). Hypericin has a markedly higher number of hydrogen bond donors than all other compounds. Finally, the p Ka values of hyperforin and valerenic acid differ as well. At pH 7.2 of the perfusion experiments, hypericin is present in charge states between0a n d 2, while hyperforin and valerenic acid occur essentially in the single charge state of 1. In contrast, antipyrine is fully uncharged (Table 2 ). Ex vivo transplacental transfer of hyperforin, hypericin and valerenic acid resulted in three distinctly different pro les ( Figure 2 ). Hyperforin showed little transfer to the fetal circuit, despite adecrease in the maternal circuit. After 240 min of perfusion, only 7.2% of initial concentration appeared in the fetal compartment, while 68.6% of hyperforin remained on the maternal side ( Figure 2A ). Hypericin did not cross the human placental barrier within 240 min,while the concentration in the maternal compartment decreased toTABLE 2 Predicted physicochemical properties of study compounds.

At the same time, antipyrine as a connectivity control reached an equilibrium after 120 min(Figures 2B, D ). For valerenic acid, a gradual increase in the fetal compartment and a concomitant decrease in the maternalcompartment was observed, reaching an equilibrium after240 min (44.0% 45.0% [maternal] of initial concentration; Figure 2E ). The integrity of maternal and fetal circuits was again con rmed with antipyrine ( Figure 2F ). Perfusion pro les with absolute concent rations can be found in Supplementary Figure S1 . The FM ratio ( Figure 3 ) of hyperforin reached a maximum of 0.18 after 180 min, thereby con rming that only minor amounts crossed the placental barrier . In contrast, the FM ratio of hypericin was zero, as the compound could not be detected in the fetal circuit. For valerenic acid, the FM ratio was 1.01 after 240 min, re flecting the identical concentrations in the fetal and maternal compartments. Antipyrine as a positive control reachedan equilibrium between fetal and maternal concentrations after 90 min (FM ratio of 1.03), which remained unchanged during thecourse of the experiment (FM ratios of 0.98, 1.05, 0.92 at 120, 180,and 240 min, respectively). Recovery and stability of the test substances The system adherence tests (empty perfusions; Figure 4 ) revealed that negligible proportions of hypericin, valerenic acidand antipyrine were lost over a period of 240 min (calculatedvalues of 3.8%, 5.6%, and 2.2% of initial concentration, respectively). The relative amount of hyperforin which adhered to the perfusion equipment after 240 min was signi cantly higher (65.4%). Apart from the system adherence test, several aspects must be considered for the recovery calculations of study compounds duringplacental perfusions ( Figure 5 ). After 240 min of perfusion, thecompounds were distributed in the two compartments (fetal vs. maternal) in the following 34.4%). As shown in Supplementary Table S1 and in Figure 5 , 17.2% -24.1% of the test compounds were removed by sampling during the perfusion, corresponding to one-fourth of the nal recovery. When assessing the nal recovery in the placenta perfusions (without considering the results of the independent system adherence test), the following values were obtained: for valerenic acid. Limited stability of study compounds in the various matrices could lead to misleading results. Therefore, their stability wasassessed over 360 min in three different matrices that wererelevant for our experiments ( PBS, PM, and three placental homogenates [Donors 1 -3]) and at ( Figure 6 ). Hyperforin and hypericin were stable over 360 min at 4\u00b0Ca n d3 7\u00b0C in PBS compared to PM, while the stability data of valerenic acid were very comparable in PBSand PM (approx. 100%). In addition, the solubility of hyperforinwas higher in PM than in PBS (121% vs. 100%, Supplementary FIGURE 4 Adherence of study compounds in a 240 min system adherencetest (circulation of study compounds through an empty perfusion chamber comprising only the maternal circuit).

All data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD of three to four independent experiments. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08Spiess et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1123194Figure S2 ). A loss hyperforin was observed in the presence of placental homogenate, with 82.0% (Donor 1), 88.0% (Donor 2), and 90.0% (Donor 3) remaining after 360 min. Some degradation in homogenate at 37\u00b0C was also observed with hypericin (101.0%, 82.7%, 93.7% respectively). The use ofthree different placental hom ogenates (Donors) resulted in comparable values for all test substances. Some differences attributable to matrix effects could be demonstrated forhyperforin and hypericin in separate experiments (seeSupplementary Figure S2 ).Effects on placental function and histology Possible effects of the study compounds on placental metabolic activity and hormonal production were alsoinvestigated. The metabolic act ivity of all perfused placental tissues was similar, as neither glucose consumption norconcomitant lactate production were affected by the studycompounds ( Figure 7A ). With antipyrine (from control perfusions), the total glucose consumption and lactateproduction during the perfusion were 0.39 and 0.27 \u00b5mol/g/ FIGURE 6 Stability data for hyperforin (A), hypericin (B), and valerenic acid (C)expressed as percentage (%) of the initial concentration (C0) in PBS. The stability test was performed for 360 min at two different temperatures (4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C) and three different matrices (PBS), perfusion medium (PM), and placental homogenates from three different donors. Differences due to matrix effects were excluded in a separate experiment ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). All data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD. Frontiers in Pharmacology hCG) and leptin production were determined as an additional measure for placental function and found to be somewhat lower in the presence of all compounds(Figure 7B ). However, neither hyperforin, hypericin, nor valerenic acid inhibited their p roduction in a statistically signi cant manner. This implied that the tissue of all placentae retained their functionality throughout the ex vivo perfusion period. A -hCG production of 1.44 U/min and leptin production of 2.26 ng/min was observed in control perfusions with antipyrine only. Detailed histopathological examination of the perfused tissue revealed that microscopic effects of perfusion were seen in additionto the macroscopically apparent pale tissue ( Table 3 ): i) villous vessels of the perfused side were 80% empty (non-perfused area was 20% empty of blood), ii) intervillous space of perfused tissue was 70% empty of blood (vs. 30% -80% in non-perfused area) and equally or more dilated in contrast to the non-perfused side, iii) formation of hydropic villous changes was found more frequently in the perfused (5%-40%) than in the non-perfused areas (0% -5%), and iv) a clear transition between perfused and non-perfused tissue was observedin most of the cases. The endothelium in the perfused tissue wasstill viable after 360 min of perfusion. Other histopathologicalobservations that argue against damage to placental tissue afterperfusions with the test substances (hyperforin, hypericin, valerenicacid) were i) a low percentage of thrombi in villous vessels (up to 5%) of perfused tissue, ii) no thrombi detectable in vessels stem villi (perfused and non-perfused), iii) trophoblast vacuolization inperfused areas a proportion of 0% -30% and was substance-independent, some but not all (two out of four)cotyledons perfused with valerenic acid showed higher proportions(80% -90%), iv) no ruptures of villous vessels, and v) no extravasations into villous stroma. No signs of in flammation were found in any of the examined perfused tissue areas, as neither bacteria nor neutrophils were present in the villous vessels and intervillous spaces. In addition, the assessment of global placental pathologywas unremarkable, with no evidence villitis, chronic deciduitis, non-perfused areas of the placenta. In vitro permeability assays All results shown so far were obtained with term placentae. To better evaluate the transplacental passage of valerenic acid, the in vitro BeWo b30 Transwell model was used. Hyperforin and hypericin were not suited for these experiments as they did not cross the cell-free inserts to a suf cient extent (data not shown). In our hands, a dense BeWo b30 cell layer was obtained 9 days after cell seeding on semi-permeable insert membranes. This timepoint was chosen because i)translocation of NaF (a marker of paracellular passive diffusion) wasminimal, with a basolateral amount of 2.8% of the initial NaFconcentration ( Supplementary Figure S3 ), ii) TER values reached a value of 30cm 2on day 9 after cultivation, which was markedly higher than in previous days ( Supplementary Figure S4A ), and the C cl was below the expected 5 F/cm2(Supplementary Figure S4B )a n d ,i i i ) staining of nuclei (blue) and actin (red) showed gapless growth ofBeWo b30 cells on cell culture inserts ( Supplementary Figure S5 ). In this Transwell model, valerenic acid did not cross the placental cell layer within 60 min to reach detectableconcentrations. In contrast, valerenic acid could pass the semi-permeable cell-free insert to the same extent as the positive control antipyrine ( Figure 8A ; 28.3 L within 60 min). Antipyrine crossed from the apical to the basolateral compartment through theplacental cell layer and the semi-permeable cell-free insertmembrane at the same clearance rate ( Figure 8B ; 35.5 L and 33.5L, respectively). The P appwas zero for valerenic acid, and 28.0 \u00d7 106cm/s for The 60 valerenic acid, and 81.9% \u00b1 included the nal amounts in the apical, basolateral, and cellular compartment ( Supplementary Figure S6 ). Mean TER and C clvalues were similar before and after the permeability experiment withvalerenic acid and antipyrine ( Supplementary Figure S7 ).

Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 11Spiess et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1123194Discussion Main ndings Our results from the ex vivo human term placental perfusion model showed that only minor amounts of hyperforin were transported to the fetal circulation, resulting in a very low FM ratio. Hypericin did not cross the placental barrier, while valerenicacid equilibrated between the maternal and fetal compartments. Inaddition, metabolic, functional, and histopathological properties ofplacentae during perfusions were not signi cantly altered by the test substances. Observations performed with the in vitro Transwell model with human placental cells indicated that valerenic acidwas unable to cross the cell monolayer, thereby suggesting that the compound may not cross cytotrophoblast layers. Our observations from the ex vivo human term placental perfusion model t well with the predicted physicochemical properties of the investigated molecules and an expectedtransport through the placenta barrier by passive diffusion. It islikely that the relatively high MW ( >500) of hyperforin and hypericin, together with their at pH 7.2,hindered their transfer [compare with ( Syme et al., 2004 ;Tetro et al., 2018 )]. In contrast, the markedly smaller valerenic acid could equilibrate between maternal and fetal compartments almost asquickly as antipyrine (MWs of 234.3 and 188.2, respectively).Although our results are in line with a transfer by passivediffusion, a possible involvement of additional mechanisms in thetransplacental transfer of hyperforin, hypericin and valerenic acidrequires further investigation. The results of our stabilityexperiments revealing some degradation of hyperforin, and to a smaller extent hypericin, at 37 \u00b0C but not at 4\u00b0C suggest some metabolization of these compounds through placenta enzymes. Strengths and limitations Plant extracts consist of a variety of different compounds, some of which are present in low amounts only. Therefore, it was crucial to develop sensitive U(H)PLC-MS/MS methods capable of detecting very low concentrations of analytes that one would expect in vivo upon oral ingestion of phytomedicines. However, it should be notedthat con dent statements can only be made within the calibration range (see Materials and methods). A limitation of the study is thatconcentrations below the limit of quanti cation had to be assumed to be zero. Ex vivo placental perfusion is to date the only experimental model preserving the structural integrity and cell- cell organisation of the organ. It most closely mimics the in vivo situation and, therefore, provides good predictions for placentaltransfer in vivo . A disadvantage of the model is that it represents the situation at term, when transplacental transfer is known to bemaximal. For compounds that were not transferred in this model(hyperforin and hypericin) one can reasonably assume that they arealso not transferred at earlier stages of pregnancy. The in vitro Transwell model that mimics the cytotrophoblast monolayer ( Bode et al., 2006 ;V\u00e4h\u00e4kangas and Myllynen, 2006 ), provided valuable information for valerenic acid. We opted for not testing hyperforinand hypericin in the Transwell model, since under our experimentalconditions these molecules did not cross the membranes of theinserts (in the absence of a cell layer) in a measurable way. The transfer across the membranes was not signi cantly increased when using high protein concentration in the medium (up to 4% BSA; datanot shown). High protein concentrations have been used to improvesolubility and, hence, transfer of poorly soluble compounds ( F\u00fcller et al., 2018 ). Similar limitations of such permeability experiments with hypericin have been previously described in the Caco cell model ( Verjee et al., 2015 ). A limitation common to both models is that they cannot fully represent the in vivo situation, as they do not take into account aspects such as dissolution, absorption,distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the compounds(Poulsen et al., 2009 ;Hutson et al., 2011 ;Myllynen and Vahakangas, 2013 ), which strongly in fluence transplacental transfer. Finally, the two methods only allow a study of short- term toxic effects on placental tissue and cells, while in pregnancy the placentae are exposed for extended periods to the substances.Especially with compounds that accumulate in cell membranes, suchas hypericin [( Verjee et al., 2015 ); own unpublished observations], this might lead to an underestimation of possible undesired effects. Recovery of hyperforin, hypericin and valerenic acid Experiments with hyperforin and hypericin required special attention, due to their high lipophilicity and poor solubility. In theabsence of biological material, hyperforin showed a signi cant loss in the empty perfusions (65.4% over a 4-h period) which could be due toadsorption to tubing/equipment or precipitation. The higher recoveryin the presence of placental tissue could be explained by the higher protein content in the system. The presence of protein is needed to stabilize and solubilize this compound, as described in literature(F\u00fcller et al., 2018 ), and this was re flected by the high stability in the PM but not in presence of PBS ( Figure 6 ). The amounts in the fetal and maternal compartments, and the amounts removed by samplingwere comparable for hyperforin (78.4%) and for antipyrine (79.2%).In addition, loss of hyperforin in the incubations with placentalhomogenates may indicate a possible metabolisation. The lowest nal recovery was found for hypericin (54.0%), although there was only a small loss due to system adsorption (3.8% over a 4-h period).Again, stability was good in PM but not in PBS ( Figure 6 ). However, the recovery data did not take into account the percentage in placentaltissue. Interestingly, fluorescence microscopic images showed a considerable accumulation of hypericin in placental cells (data notshown), which is similar to previous observations with Caco-2 cells(Verjee et al., 2015 ). In the placental perfusion model valerenic acid showed good stability and high recovery, thereby facilitating data interpretation. St. John 's wort: Comparison with previous in vitro studies Previous in vitro studies showed that extracts from St. John 's wort had no negative impact on placental cells at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL (cytotoxicity, apoptosis) or 100 \u00b5g/mL (genotoxicity,metabolic activity, and placental cell differentiation) (Spiess et al., 2021 ). Our present data with term placentae suggest Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 12Spiess et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1123194that a possible fetal exposure to hypericin and hyperforin is likely minimal. This is particularly important, as transplacental transportis maximal at term due to a decrease of cell layer thickness andnumber of cell layers towards the end of pregnancy ( van der Aa et al., 1998 ;V\u00e4h\u00e4kangas and Myllynen, 2006 ).In vitro , hyperforin showed no effects on viability, metabolic activity, and on induction of placental cell differentiation at concentrations up to 30 M. However, hyperforin led to increased apoptosis and genotoxiceffects starting at concentrations of 3 and 10 M, respectively, and inhibited FSK-induced placental cell differentiation atconcentrations of 1\u00b5 M( Spiess et al., 2022b ). It should be noted that these test concentrations were signi cantly higher than reported plasma concentrations in humans. Upon oral administration of asingle dose of 300 mg St. John 's wort extract containing 14.8 mg hyperforin a maximum plasma concentration of 150 ng/mL (approx. 0.28 \u00b5M) was reached ( Biber after single dose administration of 612 mg and900 mg dry extract, respectively ( Schulz et al., 2005b ;a). However, the hyperforin content in commercially available products can varyconsiderably ( Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2019 ). Given that low amounts of hyperforin can possibly cross the transplacental barrier, and our recent data on inhibition of cell differentiation at 1\u00b5 M concentrations in BeWo cells ( Spiess et al., 2022b ), it may be prudent to resort in pregnancy to products with a low hyperforincontent. Hypericin lowered the viability of placental cells already at1M concentrations, and apoptotic and genotoxic effects were seen at concentrations of 1 and 10 M, respectively ( Spiess et al., 2022b ). The amount of hypericin in commercially available drugs varies. Forproducts marketed in Switzerland and Germany, amounts ranging from 0.08 mg to 0.21 mg per 100 mg of tablet have been reported (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2019 ). In human volunteers, plasma concentrations of 2.2 ng/mL hypericin ( a4.36 nM) have been found ( Jackson et al., 2014 ). The plasma levels of hypericin thus are signi cantly lower than the concentrations found toxic in BeWo cells ( Spiess et al., 2022b ). However, plasma levels of hypericin may increase upon co- administration of certain other drugs ( Jackson et al., 2014 ). Valerian: Comparison with previous in vitro studies At concentrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL, no signs of cytotoxicity or apoptosis, and at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL, no signs ofgenotoxicity, alteration of metabolic activity and placental celldifferentiation were observed in BeWo cells ( Spiess et al., 2021 ). Valerenic in thein vitro Transwell model mimicking continuous cytotrophoblast layers that are likely to play a role in the placenta barrier at earlystages of pregnancy. However, it reached an equilibrium between thefetal and the maternal circulation in the ex vivo placental perfusion model representative for late stages of pregnancy. With respect tovalerenic acid, concentrations up to 30 M did not lower viability of BeWo b30 cells, and no increase in apoptosis or genotoxicity, and no negative effect on the metabolic activity and cell differentiation were observed ( Spiess et al., 2022b ). Valerenic acid contents ranging from 1.21 mg/g to 2.46 mg/g product have been reported in productsmarketed in Australia ( Shohet et al., 2001 ), while 0.57 mg -2.20 mgvalerenic acid per tablet/capsule have been found in products marketed in Switzerland (Winker et al., manuscript underreview). For reported ( Anderson et al., 2005 ;Anderson et al., 2010 ). Considering that valerenic acid did not affect cell viability in BeWo b30 cells at concentrations up to 30 M(Spiess et al., 2022b ), the valerenic acid content in products, and reported plasma concentrations, thereappears to be a large safety margin. Final statement Hyperforin could only cross the complex placental barrier to a very small extent, while hypericin appeared to be non-permeable. Valerenic acid crossed the placental barrier at term whenpermeability is higher, but not in the in vitro BeWo transfer model representative of cytotrophoblast monolayer. Takentogether, our data suggest that when treating mild mentaldisorders with St. John 's wort and valerian extracts, fetal exposure to hypericin and hyperforin and, at early stages ofpregnancy to valerenic acid, is likely to be low. Our study included so far only single compounds that are considered as relevant for the pharmacological properties of St. John 's wort and valerian. Given that the entire extracts, and not just singlecompounds, are considered as the active ingredient ofphytomedicines, the possible in fluence of the extract matrix on placental permeability of these compounds should be evaluated.Recent in vitro data in BeWo cells with St. John 's wort and valerian extracts, and with hyperforin, hypericin and valerenic et al., 2022b ) suggest moreover no toxicity at concentrations to be expected in humans at the recommendedextract doses, but caution against using products containing highamounts of hyperforin.

Placental passage of protopine 10.1055/a -1829 -9546 213 5 FINAL REMARKS AND PERSPECTIVE S There are several reasons for the use of phytomedicines in pregnancy: on the one hand, many women are affected by NMDs [1], whereby conventional synthetic drugs do not have an optimal side effect profile, neither for the unborn child nor for the expectant mother [2-4]. On the other hand, many women prefer to use herbal alternatives [5], which are also preferentially prescribed by health care professiona ls [6]. Therefore, it was of great importance to investigate the safety of possible herbal alternatives in pregnancy. We have focused on St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops, which are all well -regarded phytomedicines with potential to tre at NMDs. In this section, the clinical relevance of our findings for the assessment of their safety are discussed in light of physiologically attainable plasma concentrations. Having worked extensively on the safety of diverse herbal medicines, several new perspectives have emerged, which are presented thereafter. St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) St. John's wort has a long history as an antidepressant. For ailing pregnant mothers, it is one of the most commonly used herbal medicine, although institut ions disagree on its use in pregnancy: while the EMA does not recommend its use due to lack of sufficient data [7], Embryotox considers its use acceptable, taking into account the potential for interaction, and synthetic antidepressants (e.g., sertraline, citalopram) are mentioned as more suitable alternatives [8]. According to our survey, a large majority of women use herbal pharmaceutical medicines and teas during pregnancy. Of these, only 3.5% (12/341) of pregnant women took St. John's wort. However, the use of antidepressants decreased compared with the pre -pregnancy period, and only a few women reported the use of synthetic antidepressants. Overall, a substantial number of women suffered from depressed mood, leading us to the following hypothesis: women are more likely to resort to herbal alternative s, leave symptoms of depression untreated, or conceal the use of antidepressants. The latter may be due to the stigma and negative attitudes of society towards antenatal depression and antidepressant use during pregnancy [9]. In our survey, the effectiveness of St. John's wort was only perceived moderate to good, which is su rprising given that the antidepressant effect of St. John's wort has been demonstrated in several clinical trials [10]. In BeWo b30 cells , St. John's wort extract neither genotoxic effects on placental cells ( 30 \u00b5g/mL ) and was not able to alter their metabolic function nor affect differentiation and protein expression. The absence of toxic effects of St. John's wort extract in this concentration range was confirmed in another immortal ized human placental cell line (JEG - 3), as no effects on cell viability were observed at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL [11]. We suspected that a few characteristic compounds in St. John's wort per se might cause safety i ssues at 214 high concentrations. We focused on hyperforin and hypericin, the best -studied constituents of St. John's wort that also play a major role in pharmacological effects as two examples for closer examination [12]. Looking at the in vitro effects of hyperforin, the inhibition of placental c ell differentiation from as low as 1 \u00b5M is particularly striking. Such inhibition would prevent the successful formation and expansion of the syncytiotrophoblast and thus significantly impair the function of the human placenta and preservation of a healthy pregnancy [13]. Under the influence of 0.3 \u00b5M hyperforin, we did not observe any negative effects on the placental cell line. The concentration of 1 \u00b5M appears r elatively unattainable compared to the maximum achievable hyperforin plasma concentrations of 0.3 \u00b5M ever reported in literature ( 168.35 ng/mL hyperforin after administration of a soft gelatin capsule containing 300 mg St. John's wort dry extract with 5% hyperforin and 0.3% hypericin, Hammer Pharma SpA [14]). Nevertheless, the observed effects on cell differentiation co nclusively show that no attempts should be made to treat pregnant women with hyperforin -enriched preparations . In fact, low hyperforin -preparations should be preferred. A variety of pharmaceutical products containing St. John's wort extract are marketed in Switzerland, with different hyperforin (and hypericin) contents, of which products (HyperiMed, Hyperiforce; A.Vogel) do not contain any hyperforin [15]. Regarding plasma concentrations of 8.8 nM ( 4.43 ng/mL ) after multiple dos e administration are much lower than those of hyperforin [16]. To conclude , no reduction in placental cell viability, increased apoptosis, and genotoxicity are expected to be clinically relevant in human s at the recommended doses of products containing St. John's wort extracts . Pregnant women should nevertheless preferentially be treated with preparations low in hyperforin. In the ex vivo placental perfusion model using term placentae, however, only small amounts of hyperforin could be transported into the fetal circulation, and hypericin could not cross the placental barrier. Furthermore, neither compound affected m etabolic (glucose consumption, lactate production) or functional ( -hCG and leptin production) parameters of the placenta, in addition to an inconspicuous global placental pathology. These observations speak in favor of a good safety of St. John's wort preparations for the fetus. Both , hyperforin and hypericin (504.44 g/mol) are molecu les and are known for their physicochemical properties such as high insolubility and lipophilicity. The two constituents were therefore not suitable for use in some models such as the in vitro Transwell model as they could not cross artificial barriers (e. g., polycarbonate membrane inserts). 215 California poppy ( Eschscholzia californica ) California poppy is not well known in Switzerland, which was seen in the results of our survey, as none of the pregnant women consumed this plant for the treatment of NMDs d uring pregnancy. Evidence for sedative, anxiolytic and spasmolytic effects of the plant are mainly based on many years of experience. Its effectiveness was only assessed either in combination with hawthorn and magnesium [17] or valerian extract [18], in open -label studies with few participants, or in patients with chronic pain [19]. Nevertheless, based on the available pharmaceutical products, the use of California poppies is widespread, especially in France and North America. In Switzerland, there is no product on the pharmaceutical market containing the extract of California poppy. Only one product is registered (Arkocaps\u00ae Escholtzia; Arko Diffusion SA) consisting of capsules containing the powdered drug (flowering herb) of California poppy [20]. Extracts of California poppy ( 30 \u00b5g/mL) and protopine ( 10 \u00b5M), an alkaloid of California poppy, showed no effects on in vitro safety parameters, as they did not exhibit cytotoxic or genotoxic potential, nor d id they affect metabolic activity or differentiation of placental cells. Moreover, they were not able to significantly alter protein expression of BeWo b30 cells, suggesting that the use of California poppy extracts in pregnancy appears to be relatively sa fe, although plasma concentrations of protopine have not yet been published. Ex vivo , protopine did not alter glucose consumption, lactate, and hormone production of the perfused placentae. In contrast, it was able to cross the placental barrier , and 20% of the initial concentration appeared in the fetal circulation after 6 hours. Whether this has an influence on the development of the unborn child remains unanswered. Given protopine's inconspicuous performance in all types of performed in vitro and ex viv o experiments, it is tempting to speculate that no harm is to be expected. Valerian ( Valeriana officinalis ) Valerian has a long tradition of use and is mainly known as a sleeping aid. Its efficacy in improving sleep quality has been demonstrated in several studies [21]. In pregnancy, the Swedish Birth Register reports common usage, and no adverse effect on pregnancy outcome has been reported [22]. In vivo , however, there are conflicting results, which is why the EMA does not recommend its use in pregnancy [23]. Other institutions, such as Embryotox [24] and SAPP [25], on the other hand, support the use of (non -alcoholic!) preparations in pregnancy. On the Swiss market there are some herbal preparations in solid or liquid form containing only valerian extract (Somnofor\u00ae, Sedonium\u00ae). More frequently, valerian occurs in combination with other plant extracts such as hop cones (Valverde\u00ae Schlaf, Redormin\u00ae, Hova\u00ae), lemon balm leaves (Dormiplant\u00ae) or both (Baldriparan\u00ae) [20]. 216 In our survey, valerian was taken by pregnant women mainly in the last trimester for the treatment of sleep disorders and restlessness and was very effective with good to very good tolerability. In vitro, valerian extract decreased the viability and increased the apoptosis rate of placental cells only at artificially high concentrations of 100 \u00b5g/mL. Under the influence of 30 \u00b5g/mL of valerian extract the proteome of BeWo b30 cells was not altered, as no biological changes in differential expression of proteins could be observed. Valerenic acid showed no adverse effects in vitro up to high concentrations of 30 \u00b5M, whereas valtrate, another constituent of valerian, exerted significant toxic effects, as cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and genotoxicity increased under the influence of 10 \u00b5M, and metabolic activity (glucose consumption, lactate production) was significantly decreased at levels as low as 1 \u00b5M valtrate. Based on these data, we think that valerenic acid is relatively safe in pregnancy, as no toxic effects were observed under expected maximum serum levels of 18.2 \u00b5M ( 2.8 \u00b5g/mL ) after single mg valerian (Sedonium, Lichtwer Pharma) via indwelling catheter in the arm vein [26]. Even lower plasma concentrations of valerenic acid are to be expected upon oral application . Regarding valtrate, there are no plasma concentrations available in literature, and effects should be interpreted with caution because valepotriates (e.g., valtrate, isovaltrate) are very unstable and easily degraded by heat, acids, or bases [27], meaning that they are not present in commercially available products containing valerian extract. In fact, we could not detect them when characterizing an extract of V. officinalis by HPLC - PDA -ESI-MS analysis (see Supporting Information in [28]). For this reason, we did not investigate the ability of valtrate to cross the placental barrier in vitro and ex vivo . At the end of pregnancy, valerenic acid is able to cross the placental barrier unhindered, as same concentrations were detected in the maternal and fetal circulation after 4 hours of placental perfusion. A thorough histopathological examination revealed inconspicuous global placental pathology and unaltered metabolic and functional activity of the pla centae after placental perfusions with valerenic acid. In the in vitro Transwell model , however, valerenic acid was unable to cross the placental cell layer. This speaks for the safety of valerenic acid in early pregnancy, where the unborn child is particu larly susceptible to toxic environmental influences. 217 Lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia ) Lavender is particularly known for its anxiolytic properties [29]. Although some studies demonstrate the clinical efficacy of lavender oil [30], safety data in pregnancy are largely lacking. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the safety of lavender oil preparations in pregnancy. Therefore, many institutions do not provide recommendations for its use in pregnancy. Interestingly, our survey showed that lavender is one of the most frequently taken phytomedicine during pregnancy (16.2%, 56/345) , which may be due to the increased number of women suffering from anxiety during vs. before pregnancy. Overall, i ts effectiveness was described as good to very good by almost half of the women (46.4%, 26/56), but bad by almost as many (35.7%, 20/56). Neither lavender essential oil nor linalool, one of the two main components of the essential oil, had toxic effects on placental cells in vitro . Therefore, it was surprising that lavender oil exerted the greatest effect on protein expression, as a total of 24 proteins were significantly up - or down - regulated. However, considering the large diversity of proteins (3999 proteins in total), the impact was not significant. Moreover, no explicit signaling pathway was excessively involved. Peak plasma concentrations of linalool are very low with 0.14 \u00b5M of Lasea\u00ae (Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co KG), respectively [31]. In vitro , we have incl uded concentrations of up to 30 \u00b5M linalool, which did not cause any toxicity or impairment of placental cell function. Given that linalool is known to be a volatile substance, we measured its loss under our experimental in vitro experiments. In future exp eriments, it is advisable to carefully select the exposure time and even of the location of treated cells within cell plates. Due to the high volatility, we decided against investigating the placenta permeability of linalool. Hops ( Humulus lupulus ) Despite a long history of traditional use, clinical studies, and in vivo data on the safety of hop preparations in pregnancy are lacking. Institutions can therefore not provide any recommendations for use in pregnancy. In our survey, women reported taking hops for the relief of stress, restlessness, or sleep disorders with a very good effectiveness. However, only a few women (2.3%, 8/343) indicated taking hops, which is significantly less than those reported taking valerian. A possible reason for this coul d be that women are unaware that most phytopharmaceuticals for sleep disorders and restlessness contain a combination of hops and valerian, and sometimes even other herbal extracts such as passionflower and lemon balm [20]. 218 In vitro , hop s extract had no harmful effect on placental cells at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5g/mL. Moreover, it coul d neither alter the metabolic activity of the cells nor inhibit or induce differentiation. The fact that the incubation with hops extract could not alter the protein expression also supports its safety. New perspectives in herbal safety research in pregnancy Our survey was conducted among pregnant women in the Canton of Zurich, where general interest in the use of phytotherapy is high and numerous herbal medicines are well known. I n our experimental work, we focused on five phytomedicines that could be used as alternatives for the treatment of NMDs in pregnancy. We realized, however, that there are other medicinal plants that might be of interest, such as This led us to the question, how should we address their safety in pregnancy in view of the lessons learned during the last four years of research. To study other plants regarding their safety in pregnancy, testing of herbal extracts in vitro is certainly a good start to rule out cyto - and genotoxic effects in a physiological range. The experimental se tup to investigate aspects , such as influence of herbal extracts on metabolic activity, placental cell differentiation or gene expression is relatively straightforward in its operation. Since we know very little about the pharmacological activities and tar get genes of herbal extracts and given that the metabolic pathways and phytochemistry are complex, the proteomics -based approach is highly recommended as it provides unbiased, high -throughput and quantitative results allowing the study of numerous proteins (of interest). Additionally, it provides valuable insights into toxicological metabolic pathways or enrichments of biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, or protein classes. To assess the safety of the fetus in case of exposure to herbal extracts, transplacental transport must be studied, fav orably with both the in vitro Transwell in combination with the ex vivo human placental perfusion model. The former has a high throughput and can be employed for long exposure times up to several days, which are certainly advantages of the model. It is, ho wever, a highly simplified model with absence of flow and hydrostatic pressure. However, the disadvantages of this method include the complexity of the experimental setup and a non -universal protocol for operation, leading to results that were non -reproduc ible in our laboratory setting. This, together with the use of only one cell line (BeWo b30) and lack of cellular complexity, constitutes a major drawback of the model. To be closer to reality, in vitro co-culture models should be used in the future, which include (primary human) placental endothelial cells and primary placental [33, 34] . The 219 interaction of different cell types, as well as the stiffness of the matrix or absence of bloo d flow exert an influence on the functionality of the tissue barrier; therefore placenta -on-a-chip models have gained application in research. These models have microchannels to mimic blood flow at the placental barrier [34, 35] . Further research should, ap art from transplacental transport, also investigate whether phytomedicines affect the transport of important nutrients such as glucose, which is essential for fetal survival. Until now, it has not been used for the transport of phytochemicals , and we have noticed that this model is not suitable for some phytochemicals, such as hyperforin and hypericin, because their physicochemical properties do not allow them to pass artificial membranes. Additional models are therefore needed. The use of the ex vivo mode l to study the safety of herbal medicines is questionable for several reasons: (i) only selected phytochemicals can be tested, not reflecting the complexity of the entire extract and therefore excluding synergistic effects of multiple phytochemicals, (ii) most molecules, and especially small (< 500 Da), lipophilic, and non -ionized ones [36], are highly likely to be placenta -permeable via passive diffusion, (iii) the model reflects only one stage (term) of pregnancy and cannot account for changes in placental structure and function, and (iv) it is a very complex and technically challenging mo del with a very low success rate of about 20% [37]. The throughput of the model is mainly reduced by availabilities (maternal health status, absent informed consent) and condition of placentas (such as damaged cotyledon surface, inappropriate fetal vessels, absence of fetal membrane). Despite its limitations, the ex vivo perfusion model uses structurally intact parts of the placenta, which best reflects the in vivo situation in humans, being often seen as the gold standard to investigate transplacent al transport. In addition, the high (genetic) variability from placenta to placenta reflects the situation in the human population better compared to the genetically homogenous immortalized cell lines. The ex vivo placental perfusion approach therefore allows estimation of fetal exposure under physiological conditions , and direct effects on intact placental tissue can be studied, supporting the establishment of a realistic safety assessment of phytochemicals. Before performing an ex vivo placental perfusion , however, it is advisable to assess the stability and characterize placental metabolization of each phytochemical. As in our work, this can be accomplished by incubating the compound it in the various conditions (matrices) including placental homogenates. Experiments performed with hydrocortisone, a substance known to be metabolized in the placenta [38, 39] , confirmed the feasibility of this approach (data not shown). Another proposed interest would be the investigation of the metabolism of phytochemicals by the gut microbiota upon oral administration and/or by the liver after intestinal absorption, and the characterization of possible metabolites using previously described in vitro models. 220 In addition to the in vitro and ex vivo models, the diversity of phytochemicals contained in extracts can also be tested in silico . Using complex pharmacokinetic models (PBPK), maternal -fetal drug exposure, transplacental permeability clearance and maternal/fetal tissue exposure can be calculat ed considering various parameters [40, 41] . This could constitute an initial screening instrument that reserves the time -consuming in vitro work for those phytochemicals most likely to cause safety issues. Clinical translation of our findings - from bench to bedside To increase the awareness of California poppy, such p hytopharmaceuticals should be introduced to pharmacies and other healthcare facilities by on -site training sessions of sales representatives, which would consequently increase their use among patients in general (apart from pregnant women). Thus, it is qui te possible that phytopharmaceuticals containing the extract of California poppy would establish themselves on the Swiss market, which in turn would certainly increase the interest in clinical studies. The evidence -level on safety of treatments during pre gnancy, and in particular on herbal medicines, should be improved. In obstetrics, evaluation of potential teratogenic effects of new and well -established drugs is essential, as are possible effects on intrauterine growth. The available experimental models can provide useful information on this to some extent but should be chosen carefully to answer the scientific question(s) in the best possible way. All models have certain limitations, and, above all, it is the distancing from reality that is most criticiz ed. Collection of data on the use of medication and monitoring of human births remains essential for the detection of birth defects. There are currently few or no reports of possible teratogenic effects of herbal medicines such as California poppy, laven der, and hops, which may be used to treat mild NMD. For this reason, institutions such as HMPC, Embryotox, and SAPP do not yet make recommendations for their clinical practice in pregnancy. For example, the Swedish National Medical Birth Register collects information from prenatal, delivery and neonatal care, providing valuable information such as medical drug use during pregnancy, diagnoses before and during pregnancy, mode of delivery, fetal presentation, and equal importantly outcome data such as birth w eight, body length and head circumference of the infant and fetal diagnoses including malformations [42]. In this context, personal data may be processed for research purposes, which is also necessary for reasons of substantial public interest [43]. 221 Most of the herbal medicines studied in this work, such as St. John's wort, valerian, hops, and lavender, are already being used in pregnancy. Therefore, it is particularly important in the future that safety recommendations can be made based on evidence -based information. To obtain information on medication use and pregnancy outcome, there are several approaches: (i) locally, with a digital application (eMutterPass, University Hospital Zurich) which contains all relevant medical information of a pregnancy (e.g., personal history, prescribed drugs, ultrasound data, fetal growth chart, scan images). A survey showed that women would be willing to provide detailed information on their (non -prescribed) medication consumption interactively by taking pictures of drug packaging, filling in medication dosages or submitting assessments of perceived drug effectiveness. In addition, most women do not seem to be concerned about data security and confidentiality [44]: (ii) nationally, through the introduction of the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) in Spring 2020 where health professionals such as physicians and pharmacists can collect treatment - related documents of patients (including pregnan t women) in Switzerland. The EPR also offers the possibility of providing an overview of medication use (also during pregnancy), including documentation of herbal medicines use which are available OTC [45]. However, it is not yet clear to what extent access rights and data protection laws permit data analysis for research purposes. Moreover, the way the data is s tored (as PDF files) does not allow the direct analysis of the data. To summarize, our studies with St. John's wort, California poppy, valerian, lavender, and hops, contribute to a better understanding of their toxic potential for the treatment of NMDs un der the very delicate circumstances of pregnancy. All tested extracts were harmless in our in vitro assays, whereas some of the individual phytochemicals - nota bene at very high, likely not clinically relevant concentrations - were rather conspicuous. Assessing the safety of herbal extracts, however, has many pitfalls and is a permanent challenge, since they are multicomponent mixtures, and the variety of phytochemicals is striking. Future research efforts should continue to elucidate the safety of herbal extracts using the above -mentioned approaches, preferably with the discussed improvements. Our long -term goal should be to provide pregnant women with safe alternatives for the treatment of their conditions and symptoms and to alleviate their fear of adver se effects, associated pregnancy complications and fetal harm. 222 223 5.1 References 1.
