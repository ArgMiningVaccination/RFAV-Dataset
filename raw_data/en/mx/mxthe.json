The multi-layered GeS-FETs exhibit remarkably high photo responsivity of R ~ illumination of1.5 \u00b5W/cm2 at = 633 nm, Vg = 0 V, and Vds = 10 V. The obtained R ~ 206 AW-1 is excellent as compared with a GeSnanoribbon-based and the other family members of group IV-VI-based photodetectors in the two-dimensional (2D) realm, such SnS2. The gate-dependent photo responsivity of GeS-FETs was further measured to be able to reach R ~655 AW-1operated at Vg = -80 V. Moreover, the multi-layered GeS photo detector holds high external quantum efficiency (EQE~4.0 \u00d7 104 %) and specific detectivity (D* ~ 2.35 \u00d7 1013 Jones). The measured D* is comparable to those of the advanced commercial Si- and InGaAs-based photo diodes. The GeS photodetector also shows an excellent long-term photoswitching stability with a response time of ~7ms over a long period of operation (>1 h). These extraordinary properties of high photo current generation, broad spectral range, fast response, and long-term stability make the GeS-FET photodetector a highly qualified candidate for future optoelectronic applications.

Due to this both tissue regeneration and prevention of inflammations could be influenced, Burkholderia cepacia belonging to the inflammation factors. Solid and mesh Titanium are popular to fabricate implants. Their technological processing, annealing being one of them, provides electrical potential to the surface. The report focuses solid and mesh Titanium (Ti) annealing to control the material surface electrical potential and Burkholderia cepacia sorption in vitro. The solid and mesh Ti specimens (1x1x0.05 cm and 2x2x0.03 cm correspondingly) were prepared from the stripes and by foam technology respectively. The specimens were annealed at 600C during 2-4 h. To identify the surface electrical potential the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was employed, the photoelectron work function () was measured. The value of was directly connected to the surface electrical potential. Burkholderia cepacia strain ATCC was grown on agar at room temperature. Next, the bacteria were scrapped off from broth, resuspended in phosphate saline buffer (PSB), washed off and centrifuged. Then the liquid was discarded and supernatant was resuspended in fresh PSB. The concentration of bacteria increased on 5 and 45 %, correspondingly, if the solid and mesh Ti were annealed for 4 h. The Ti mesh in contrast with the solid Ti had a stronger influence on bacteria concentration. The experiments demonstrates the Ti surface nanolayer electrical potential is a physical factor that induces Burkholderia cepacia concentration. To decrease it more negative surface electrical potential (the higher values of ) are preferable.

PRINT\u00ae was used to fabricate uniform, monodisperse particles of various sizes and shapes to be used in different drug delivery applications. The following drug delivery applications and the effects of the PRINT platform will be discussed: sustained release of injectables, sustained release of dermal topicals, and the formulation of small molecules and biologics using the PRINT platform. Results: The following results will be reviewed: the effect of size and shape on controlled and sustained release of APIs (biologics and small molecules), encapsulation of poorly soluble APIs using PRINT, and controlling PRINT particle forms (amorphous vs crystalline). Conclusions: PRINT particles can incorporate small molecules (including difficult to formulate molecules) in a wide range of particle sizes and shapes to allow for improved properties such as enhancing dissolution profiles of poorly soluble drugs. Biologics such as Bevacizumab were encapsulated in PRINT particles of various sizes to fine tune monoclonal antibody release in vitro. Injectable PRINT particles were tuned to release API at different rates via various shapes and compositions. Biography: Donald Campbell was born in Louisiana.

School of Chemical Engineering, Yeungnam University, South Korea Developing high-performance photoctalysts and photoelectrode with enhanced visible light harvesting properties are essential for practical visible light photocatalytic applications. Noble metal-free, highly visible light-active, elemental red phosphorus (RP) was prepared by a facile mechanical ball milling method, which is a reproducible, low cost and controllable synthesis process. The synthesis used inexpensive and abundant raw materials because most RP hybrids are based on expensive noble-metal. The novel milled RP showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance with a lower charge transfer resistance than commercial RP under wide visible photoirradiation, making it a feasible alternative for photocatalytic applications.1 Biography: Moo Hwan Cho is a Professor at School of Chemical Engineering, Yeungnam University, South Korea.

Division of Pharmaceutics, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, India Leishmaniasis parasites are one of the intracellular protozoan parasites which reside primarily in host mononuclear phagocytes and usually lethal if untreated. Amphotericin B is a broad antimycotic agent and a highly antiparasitic one having severe nephrotoxicity and hematologic toxicity as the major limiting factors. These side effects led to extensive research in formulations in the form of liposomes, emulsions, lipid and polymeric nanoparticles which reduce the amount of free AmB in blood stream, thereby reducing its toxicity but their non-targetability and higher cost restricts their use to poorest to poor. Among all these colloidal carriers lipid nanoparticles have been extensively explored due to their ideal characteristics of better storage stability and higher drug loading which make it a promising candidate for novel drug delivery owing to its versatile nanotherapeutic applications. The nanoparticles surface was modified with a peptide sequence containing tuftsin. Tuftsin is known to stimulate the immune function of various cells, including macrophages (primarily), neutrophils, and monocytes. Surface modification with tuftsin was investigated on the basis of the fact that this tetrapeptide has been used for macrophage specific targeted delivery. The tuftsin modified nanoparticles could be used for effective delivery of biopharmaceuticals into the macrophages because of better accumulation in macrophage rich organs when compared with other colloidal systems due to their preferential phagocytosis. Therefore, we have developed tuftsin modified novel AmB lipid nanoconstructs. The main objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a new novel formulation of AmB as a cost effective and target oriented alternative. Various formulations were developed with the use of microfluidizer (optimized by varying pressure and number of cycles) and characterized for various parameters (particle size, zeta potential, % entrapment efficiency, morphology, stability, in vitro release and toxicity). The entrapment efficiency of AmB was achieved up to 88.4% for AmB-NLC and 83.5.3% for Tft-AmB-NLC with particle size 142\u00b16.2nm and 162.6\u00b14.4nm, and zeta potential of -28\u00b11.6 mv and +32+1.3 mv, respectively. The optimized formulations were found stable for more than 3 months in terms of particle size and size distribution. The morphological characterization of the formulations was done using Transmission Electron Microscopy. The in vitro release profile of the AmB-NLC and Tft-AmB-NLC showed 62.6% and 60.2% drug release within 24 hours, respectively. The toxicity profile showed the permissible range of haemolysis and cytotoxicity. The findings suggested that it would be preferable to deliver AmB through tuftsin anchored nanostructured lipid carriers.

Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia TiO2 nanospheres and Sn/TiO2 nanospheres were prepared by a hydrothermal method. The prepared samples were characterized by XRD, Pl, UV-Vis, BET, SEM, and TEM. The results reveal that Sn4+ replaces a small part of the Ti4+ from the TiO2 lattice. Doping of Sn increases the surface area of the TiO2 nanospheres. Doping of Sn leads to a decrease in the band gap of the TiO2 nanospheres and increases the lifetime of the electron-hole recombination. Doping of Sn into the TiO2 nanospheres enhances the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanospheres for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline under visible light. The optimal Sn loading was found to be 4 wt%. The photocatalytic activity of the 4 wt% Sn/TiO2 nanospheres is approximately 80 times greater than activity of the TiO2 nanospheres.

Dept. of Biochemistry, Collage of Science, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia Background: Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have emerged as important careers for drug delivery. However, immunological response of GNPs is complex and poorly understood. Objective: To investigate the effects of small and medium sized gold nanoparticles on the inflammatory mediators in rat liver and kidney. Methods: We studied the effects of small (10 nm) and medium (50 nm) sized GNPs and tumor necrosis (TNF-) in the liver and kidneys of rats. Results: We observed that the expression of these cytokines in the liver was significantly higher than kidneys of rats exposed to GNPs. Both 10 and 50 nm GNPs significantly increased the cytokines gene expression in liver on day 1 which was reduced on day 5. In the kidney, only the medium sized GNPs significantly increased the expression of IL-6 and TNF- on day 1, which was subsided on day 5. Conclusion: These results show that GNPs exposure only transiently increases the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines that gradually subside with time. The current data on the biocompatibility of GNPs are limited and their interpretation is controversial.

Chungnam National University, Republic of Korea Chitosan-silver nanocomposite (CAgNCs) was green synthesized without the adding any external chemical-reducing agents using low molecular weight chitosan (LMW-C) and silver nitrate. The synthesized (XRD), (FE-SEM), high-resolution Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES), particle size distribution and zeta potential analyzer. The average size of LMW-C and CAgNCs 23 nm and 23.6 nm, respectively. The zeta potential of CAgNCs observed as + 41.1 mV. It was indicating positively charged polymeric layer on AgNPs surface. The AgNPs are deposited on chitosan matrix and the average AgNPs particle size lies between 5 nm- 50 nm. The Ag content of the CAgNCs was 0.696\u00b1 0.054% (w/w). The CAgNCs also antifungal agent against candida albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of CAgNCs and LMW-C for C. albicans were recorded as 50 and 100 \u00b5g/mL, whereas the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values of CAgNCs and LMW-C for C. albicans were recorded as 150 and 400 \u00b5g/mL respectively.

College of health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia Human immunodeficiency virus continued to be the greatest challenge and killer disease of the 21st century despite the advent of potent highly active antiretroviral therapy which are limited by their severe adverse effects, significant drug interactions, frequent dosing, limited bioavailability, and less access to viral reservoir sites like macrophages. Nano-medicines are becoming new hopes in avoiding these shortcomings of conventional antiretroviral drugs. The emphasis of this review is mainly the application of polymers based nanomedicines in pharmacotherapy of HIV/AIDS. Most of the studies to date on this area are in vitro and human clinical trials are totally missed. However, many interesting points are uncovered through this review like the possibility of achieving high intracellular concentration of drugs, very good antiretroviral activity, improved bioavailability, reduced toxicity and release of the drugs from nanocarriers for long time reducing the need for frequent dosing. Indeed, a lot of assignments left behind for researchers to overcome the challenges hindering the wider application of nanomedicines in "}
