You are an Iowan with a disability or older Iowan eligible for Home- and Community-Based Waiver Services You are a friend or a family member of a person with a disability or an older Iowan eligible for HCBS Waiver services You work in the disabilities or aging services eld You care about what happens to Iowans with disabilities or older Iowans This handbook explains the Consumer Choices Option. It explains the process of creating quality support services. The Consumer Choices Option allows you, the consumer, (with help as needed) to control and direct the supports you receive as much as possible. This handbook talks about how you can have choices in your life-choices about where you live, where you work, and who you can count on for support.IntroductionGuiding Principles of the Consumer the handbook are dened in the Glossary of Terms.Table of ContentsDignity and Respec t All people have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. All people have the right to the \"dignity of risk\" and to \"know the whole story. \" Many of our greatest lessons are learned when we make choices and follow our decisions. The network of support makes risk possible by providing safety and supporting growth. Choice and Control All people have the right to choose what they will do with their lives. When people need help, friends and family can be most eective in assisting them to broaden their experiences and to exercise their right to make their own choices. Services and supports need to respond to what Iowans with disabilities and older Iowans actually want and need to be successful. Relationships Relationships provide everyone with strength, support, safety and security. It is essential that relationships are maintained and expanded. Paid services, through a traditional provider, can isolate people. The development of new relationships is crucial. Giving and Community Everyone has the ability to give to his or her community in a meaningful way. When we give of ourselves, we feel a sense of belonging. Community membership includes having your own home (where you control who comes through the door), a job, involvement in your community and making a dierence in the lives of others. To be truly independent is to be able to recognize our strengths and weaknesses, to know when to seek help and rely on the assistance of others, but also to know when to show leadership. Dreaming and Planning All people have hopes and dreams for the future as well as goals they want to achieve. A supportive team helps people identify these dreams, and then creates a plan to prioritize and realize these dreams. Personal and Fiscal Responsibility When there is control over how funds get spent, there is also responsibility to live within a budget. Making things happen does not always require money. To nd the best quality for the most reasonable price, people are able to purchase in and out of the service system. The Role of Professionals Professionals become partners with the people who hire them. They assist people in understanding what their choices are and realizing their dreams. Choice Has Limits Public funds will not be used to support choices that are illegal or harmful to the person or others. The choices must be available to all. Public funds should get a \"return on investment\" and should not be given out without expectations. Self-Determination is Honored Self-determination means becoming more creative in helping people nd ways to learn decision-making and manage their actions. Self-determination is not an excuse for abandon - ing someone in an unsafe situation on the grounds that he or she \"chose\" it. There are limits to the level of risk society will allow people to take with their own lives and physical well-being; however, it is not right to limit \"choices\" to either excessive restrictions or no support at all. Whatever It Takes There is a commitment to help people determine their dreams, respect their dreams, and help their dreams come true. An answer of \"No, we can't\" is replaced by \"How can we make this happen?\" Guiding Principles of the Consumer Choices Option 5What is a good life? What is important in life is not so hard to dene. Answers usually come down to just a few things-a pleasant home, a decent job, health, safety, having caring people around you, and feeling good about yourself. With the Consumer Choices Option, you choose services that help lead you to your version of \"the good life\" . This means: Making your own choices Speaking up when you are not happy about something Having control of your own life Being willing to try new things Figuring out what you like and don't like Asking for help when you need it Knowing the whole story Taking responsibility for your decisions Having control and making your own decisions is powerful! At times, though, everyone needs input and support about dierent parts of their lives. Many of the things you need and want in life will cost money. You will need to buy some of the help you need. You can choose the people who will help you meet your life goals. When your helpers are working for you as part of your support team, you know everyone has the same goals. Those goals are based on things important to you. Other goals you have will cost little or no money. Determining how money is spent is especially important when there isn't enough money to go around for everyone who needs it.

If you are over 18 years of age, an Independent Support Broker may not be your guardian, spouse, or legal representative. An Independent Support Broker cannot be an employee of an agency that provides direct services or supports to you. An Independent Support Broker cannot get paid to provide other services to you. An Independent Support Broker must have knowledge of local services and supports. An Independent Support Broker must be willing to undergo a criminal background check and complete the DHS minimum training requirements. Before interviewing people who are applying to be your Independent Support Broker, think about the following: What type of people do you get along with? Calm people? Energetic people? Quiet or talkative people? People your own age? Younger? Older? What type of people do you trust to help you? Do you want your Independent Support Broker to be your friend or just get the job done? How do you want your Independent Support Broker to work with your family, friends, and service providers? Is there information you want to keep private? Are there things you want to do by yourself? What questions can you ask to make sure you hire an Independent Support Broker who will work well with you? Some questions you might want to ask in your Independent SupportBroker interviews: Do you have experience supporting people with lives similar to mine? If people want a change in their life, how have you helped people make those changes? If people want things to stay exactly the same, is that okay? How many people do you work with? 910 How well do you know about local services in my community? How connected are you to my community? How often can I expect to see you? What if I need some extra help for a short time? Do you have a good relationship with provider agencies ? How have you been an advocate for the people you work with now? How do you handle situations when people on a team have dierent opinions or are not getting along? How would you help me understand my budget? How would you help me plan for my future and help me achieve my goals? How can I nd out what the people you support think about you? How often would you want me to tell you how you are doing? How do you learn about the things Independent Support Brokers are supposed to know? After you have interviewed Independent Support Broker applicants, think about the following questions to help you decide who the best person is to be your Independent Support Broker : Does he or she seem to respect and honor your opinions? Do you feel he or she will be on your side and be your advocate ? Is he or she well organized? How many important relationships and connections does he or she have in your community?

Your Independent Support Broker can help you complete time cards if you have questions. They can meet with you and/or your support team regularly at your request to make sure your plan is working or to help you make the changes you want. They can help you if the people who work for you or support you disagree about the best way to help you. They must help you review your plan at least once every three months but you can change it more often. If you become unhappy with your Independent Support Broker, remember you can change your Independent Support Broker like you can change any service provider or employee.11Your Independent Support Broker will help develop a plan with you. You are encour - aged to ask others who you trust to help. This might include your family, friends, neigh - bors, co-employees, paid professionals or your personal network of support. Together, you will also discuss ideas for implementing your plan and changing it when necessary. Your Independent Support Broker will help you to develop, implement, and change your plan as needed. He or she will write down the plan and share it with your freely chosen personal network of support. Your plan should state what support you want and need, name who will provide the support, when it will be provided and how much it will cost. Your plan should also include things that you want that do not cost money. Some free things that are important to people are time to spend with family, favorite foods, favorite activities, club or church memberships, or spending time at favorite neighborhood hang-outs. All plans need to say how you are going to address your safety and health needs. Some people think that people with signicant disabilities or frail elders are not able to be involved in the decision-making process about their lives. You should be as involved in the decision-making as much as possible. Your Independent Support Broker's job is to guarantee your involvement! Having a strong circle of friends and loved ones can help ensure that your needs, preferences, and priorities are honored and met.Chapter 4: Planning Your Individual Budget Your Individual Budget can be reviewed regularly by you and your friends, family and trusted allies.

The Consumer Choices Option gives you the opportunity to take the responsibility for planning and controlling resources to make it possible for you to live in your home and community. Services and goods purchased in your Individual Budget are intended to make it possible for you to live and stay in your home and community. You and your Independent Support Broker are encouraged to be as creative as possible when developing your Individual Budget. The following are examples of services, supports and other items in each category that you may be purchase from non-traditional Medicaid providers: Self-directed Personal Care The supports listed below can help you in your home or community and would beprovided mainly by your employee(s). The following are examples of things that can be covered: Cleaning services Medication management Homemaking tasks Personal grooming assistance Laundry assistance Assistance with mobility transfers Supervision Meal Preparation Lawn care Respite Snow removal Shopping Showering assistance Transportation Self-directed Community and Employment Supports These supports help you live and work in your community.

The item or services would decrease the need for other Medicaid services; and/or promote inclusion in the community; and/or increase your safety in your home or community.

Supports, goods and services not in these lists may be purchased only with prior approval through the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise. Approval process for other supports and goods and services If other supports, goods and services are needed that are not included in this list, you will need to describe the them in the description box on your Individual Budget form. Your Financial Management Service will let you know that your individual budget has been approved. There may be times when you will be asked to provide further information about the need of these items, goods or services before it can be approved. Items that will not be allowed on your Individual Budget: room and board, childcare and personal entertainment items. An Individualized Budget should be your blueprint for the \"good life\" !Deciding on Supports: Your Individual Budget will document your support needs and priorities. It will describe the things that maintain and improve your quality of life. During the planning process, you and others will decide how to arrange these supports in a way that meets your needs. Everyone's Individual Budget is dierent. One person may choose to purchase support entirely from agencies that specialize in helping people with disabilities or older adults. Another may choose a combination of traditional provider agencie s or non-traditional provider agencies such as hiring a co-worker to be a job coach or a neighbor to help you with housekeeping. You may decide not to utilize agency support, but instead hire your own sta. The only limitation to choosing support is to stay within your monthly allowance determined by the case manager/service worker . Things to think about when developing your Individual Budget: What do you want your life to look like in the next 12 months? 2 years? 5 years? What do you really need to stay healthy and safe? What support is important to you? What supports cost money? How can your family, friends, or your community connections help? If you can't aord everything you want, what are your most important priorities? If there are personal funds available, how can these help you get what you want? Can you get more of the support you want if you share sta, save money, have a housemate, go out with friends, share a job, etc.? Be specic; decide who will help you do what, by when. If you're not getting the help you need, decide who will help you straighten things out. Some ideas for learning about the types of support that others use: Ask Independent Support Brokers about the dierent types of support s that people use. Contact your case manager/service worker . Talk with other consumers who receive support services and their family members. Conduct informational interviews with your service providers and employees. Consider services typically provided to people without disabilities. For example, a cleaning service may be a more ecient use of money than paying a supported community living provider to clean your home. Also, many grocery stores have delivery service where you can call in an order and pay to have groceries delivered. Think about community connections! Taking a walk in your neighborhood, nding a favorite hang-out, volunteering at the community center, or attending a local place of worship all create feelings of belonging to the community. An acceptable plan is one you develop with your Independent Support Broker and others who know you best, meets your health and safety needs, and is within your monthly allowance . 14After you select an Independent Support Broker and your initial Individual Budget is written, it is time to gure out who will provide the supports described in your plan. The person-centered planning process will create many ideas about how the supports can be carried out. Your Independent Support Broker will help you put your plan into action. 15Chapter 5: Designing Supports First Steps It's time to think creatively! Start by thinking about what you need. This may be dierent from what you want. Often, there are things you can't aord and you can't gure out how to make it aordable. Questions to ask yourself when thinking about what help you need? Do I need help cleaning my house? Do I need help cooking? How do I make sure I am safe in my house? Do I need help nding a job? Do I need help at my job? Do I need help getting to my job? Do I need help getting up and ready in the morning? Consider Y our Options Talk with your Independent Support Broker about who can help you reach the goals in your Individual Budget . Prepare to compromise. There can be problems in getting the right services. There may not be enough support employees for all the people who need help. There may not be as much funding available as you would like. Someone else may get services before you get them. That happens when someone is having a crisis and needs services immediately. Although it is frustrating to have to wait or share resources, your Independent Support Broker will continue to work with you on your goals.It's Your Life...You get to choose what you want to create and how you want to create it...how to create what you want...and want what you create ! Some Ideas Pool resources with someone else . Maybe you can aord some of what you want; someone else might be in the same situation. Share resources with a friend . You might like to nd a friend to do something with you. Perhaps you can share a support person to make that happen. Have a housemate . Perhaps you thought that you wanted to live alone. However, it may be too expensive to live on your own and to aord support sta to help you. A housemate could be your friend and a support employee too. Check other funding sources . Some examples may be: The Social Security Oce The Iowa Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services Iowa Workforce Development Section 8 provides assistance with rent for housing. Families and friends might help . About Provider Agencies Provider agencies are companies that specialize in providing support services to people with disabilities and older adults. Iowa Medicaid Enterprise Member Services has a list of provider agencies. You may call them toll free at 800-338-8366 or at 515-725-1003 in the local Des Moines area or through their website at http://www.ime.state.ia.us. There are lists of provider agencies available through many resource books, websites, and in the phone book. You can contact Iowa COMPASS about available provider agencies in your area by calling them at 1-800-779-2001 or TTY 877-686-0032 or through the Iowa COMPASS website at http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/iowacompass/. You can also ask people you know if they know of any agencies. Provider agencies can send you information regarding their services, policies, service philosophy, fees, and their experience with specic issues. You may nd that some agen - cies have experience or a service philosophy that meets your needs better than others. Provider agencies have experience as service providers. If you need help in your home or at work, there is probably an agency that understands how to do it. However, some people feel that agencies' policies or procedures may interfere with your choices and freedom. Provider agencies may be the best t for some of your needs but probably not all of them. You may want to nd or create more flexible connections and supports . Interviewing Possible Support Employees Chat with your potential employees for a few minutes. Ask them to tell you about themselves including their interests. Let them tell you why they like helping people and how they help people to be part of the community. Learn what their service values are and what their strengths are. Questions to ask provider agencies about support sta: How are employees screened? How are sta matched to individuals? What training is available to employees? How are sta supervised? 16 How are employees evaluated? Will you have input in the evaluation process? How is back-up handled when a sta person is absent? What is the sta turnover rate? Other questions to consider when choosing your employee(s): Discuss costs. If services are \"packaged\" or \"bundled\" , make sure all the items in the package are needed. If not all the services in the package are needed, gure out if there is a way to pay for only those services you want. Ask about administrative costs. Administrative costs include such things as supervisory time, health insurance for sta, clerical and accounting costs, oce space, equipment and so forth. Be clear about your expectations. For employees to give you a realistic idea of how they can help you, they need to know what you expect. Get into details. For example, if you need support going to your doctor, who will take you? How are supports provided when your sta person wants to take a vacation? Talk to other people who have received services from the potential employee. Thinking About Supports Creatively and Concretely Assistance with many activities can be purchased outside of a provider agency ... You may create more flexibility in your plan and nd support for activities in places other thanprovider agencies. You can also combine services from a provider agency, from your support employees that you hire and/or from services available in your community. . .Here are some examples: If you need to wake up at a certain time to get to work... You can have one of your support employees wake you up ...or... you can ask a neighbor to stop by and make sure you are up on time. If you want to go swimming at the Y... Your support employee can take you to the Y... or... you could take a swimming class with a friend. When your house needs cleaning...

These background checks are available at no additional cost to you. Contact your nancial management service for more information on how to complete these checks You may be responsible for providing Workers Compensation Insurance which provides benets for your employees if they are injured or hurt on the job while working for you. You may be responsible for paying their medical expenses or lost wages for your employees if you do not have this type of insurance coverage(s). Contact your case manager/service worker for more information on how to access this type of insurance coverage. You will have an Individual Budget that lists all services, and supports you need, identify the people who will be providing them and show how much each service costs. The total costs must be within your pre-approved monthly allowance . When you decide where to buy supports, it is time to complete an employer-employee agreement with the new support employee. The agreement will show how much money the service you are purchasing will cost and how long the service will last. The agreement is always time-limited, usually for one year. If you use the same provider every year, you will complete the agreement once a year for that support employee. 1819After that, you will approve the time cards twice a month for each support employee you hire. Make sure it is accurate and sent in on time in order for them to be paid. Remember that you are the supervisor and you are responsible for sending in the time card. Your support employee cannot be paid without a time card . The employees you select become your partners in helping you get what you need. They are your support team! Frequent and honest communication will build a trusting relation - ship. Your Independent Support Broker can help resolve disagreements within your team. Think about people in your life who might want to be involved. Remember that everything can't be done at once. So start on the present, and keep planning for the future. Additional Services Some Home- and Community-based services are available outside of your Individual Budget if you need specialized help. Examples of specialized help are: Ill and Elderly AIDS/HIV Mental Brain Injury Physical Handicapped Retardation Disability Adult Day Care Adult Day Care Adult Day Care Adult Day Care Adult Day Care Behavioral Programming Case Management Consumer Consumer Consumer Consumer Consumer Consumer Directed Directed Directed Directed Directed DirectedAttendant Attendant Attendant Attendant Attendant AttendantCare (skilled) Care (skilled) Care (skilled) Care (skilled) Care (skilled) Care (skilled) Counseling Counseling Emergency Emergency Emergency Emergency Emergency Emergency Response Response Response Response Response Response Family Counseling and Training Home Health Home Health Home Health Home Health Aide Aide Aide Aide Interim Medical Interim Medical Interim Medical Monitoring Monitoring Monitoring and Treatment and Treatment and Treatment Mental Health Outreach Nursing Nursing Nursing Nursing Nutritional Nutritional Counseling Counseling Group Respite Group Respite Group Respite Group Respite Group Respite Specialized Specialized Specialized Specialized Specialized Respite Respite Respite Respite Respite The second step in directing your own services is choosing a Financial Management Service. Your case manager/service worker can help you get a list of the participating Iowa credit unions and banks to help you decide which Financial Management Service is best and most convenient for you. Purchasing goods, services and supports using your monthly allowance Your monthly allowance is the amount of money that you can use to buy supports and things to help you for one month. Your Individual Budget describes how this money will be spent. You, your Independent Support Broker and at your request, your personal network of support, will develop an Individual Budget. The budget you create must be within your monthly allowance and meet safety guidelines. Your Individual Budget lists the costs of supports. In Iowa, the money available to you to purchase goods and services is kept at a credit union or bank which acts as your Financial Management service. DHS will authorize the credit union or bank to pay the money to support you, according to your Individual Budget. Your monthly allowance must be kept in a special account separate from your personal money. A Financial Management Service is simply a way to make sure the money you use to buy supports will flow smoothly and legally. The credit union or bank works for you and makes sure that all federal and state laws are obeyed such as payroll taxes. The money in your monthly allowance is used to pay for your goods and services once you tell them that you approve the payment through an approved time card, \"invoice\" or \"receipt\" . All support employees that you hire must complete time cards in order to be paid. All other goods and services purchased that are listed on your budget must go with a receipt in order for payment to be made. The employer-employee agreement shows that your Independent Support Broker , your support employee(s) and you, all agree on how services are to be provided, how you will work together, and how much the services will cost. The signed agreement is sent to the credit union or bank, which then pays your support employees based upon the time cards you turn in. The credit union or bank will provide you with the paperwork necessary to hire your support employee.

The Iowa Department of Human Services Iowa Medicaid Enterprise oversees quality issues statewide.What happens if I do not use all of the money in my Individual Budget? Your Individual Budget is based on your monthly need. If the money is not been spent, it will go back to the state unless you have identied an item that you are saving for in your budget. Remember that if you are saving for an item you may only save for it for one year. If you have not purchased that item by the end of a year, the money will go back to the state. At least once a year, your monthly Individual Budget amount will be reviewed and changed based on your needs. What if I need more money than the monthly allowance says I can have for support? If you need more support, your Independent Support Broker will talk to the case manager/service worker and ask for an increased monthly allowance. Your Independent Support Broker will explain to the case manager/service worker why the increase is needed. This can occur any time during the year, and is also reviewed each year when your Individual Budget is reviewed. Case management sta approves all increases. If a change in the amount is approved, the new monthly allowance will not take eect until after the rst of the following month that the request is made. In other words, changes in the monthly allowance cannot occur in the middle of a month. Are there things or services that can't be purchased through my Individual Budget? Medicaid has rules and regulations that must be followed. Obviously, purchases must be legal and cannot be too limiting but regulations do not allow Individual Budgets to be used for institutional care or medical services such as those provided by a doctor. Examples of some items that you may not purchase through your Individual Budge t are: Groceries Equipment used for entertainment such as videos, VCRs, televisions, stereos, CDs, DVDs, audio/video tapes, etc. Illegal drugs or alcohol Sheltered workshop services Room and board Costs associated with travel (airfare, lodging, meals, etc.) for vacations or entertainment Clothing or shoes Comforters, linens, or drapes Vitamins/herbal supplements Laundry detergent or household cleaning supplies Vehicle expenses including maintenance and repairs, insurance, gas money for a personal vehicle Items which are not directly related to meeting your disability-related needs 23Chapter 8: Some Commonly Asked Questions 24What are my responsibilities?

If you choose this option, you are responsible for: Developing and following your Individual Budget (Spending plan) Hiring, supervising, and managing your support employees Approving time cards and getting them turned into the Financial Management Service on time and accurately Turning in receipts for items purchased Immediately reporting any incidents when you feel you have been abused or taken advantage of What if I disagree with a support provider? A rst step is to talk with the provider and try to work things out. Try to hear each other's viewpoint. If a problem continues, your Independent Support Broker will help you present your point of view and try to help solve the problem. Most problems can be resolved by talking openly about them. Some problems can be solved by talking it over with someone separate from the situation such as your assigned case manager/service worker . If the problems are serious enough, you may no longer want to receive support from that provider. The employer-employee agreement describes the conditions under which you and the provider can stop working together. Your Independent Support Broker can help you arrange for new supports .

How can I become a good advocate for myself? It takes condence to speak up and express your opinions. One way to develop self-condence is to have opportunities to speak in front of others. We all learn from experience. Here are some ways people can help you have opportunities to speak up: Before meetings, review the agenda with members of your support team and let them know things you want to say. After meetings, review what was decided and let your support team know if there was anything talked about that you did not understand. Most people have questions about what happened at meetings. Don't be hard on yourself as you learn to become a better self-advocate. Let things move at their own pace. Remember that changes come with time. Take opportunities to make choices in your life. The more choices you make, the better you will get at it. How can others become good advocates for people with disabilities or older adults? Listen to the person with a disability or older adult. Think about how the person communicates and ask questions in a way that is useful to the person. For example, if a person doesn't speak, use pictures or drawings to explain concepts. Continue to explore ways to pull the person into an active decision-making process. Don't speak for the person even if you think you know the answer. Try to control your own opinion. You may disagree with the decision of the person receiving services. However, it is their decision. Recognize that we all learned about how to make decisions by making some decisions that were better or worse than others. Listen to others who know the person in dierent settings. Don't let someone's credentials or position get in the way of your knowledge of the person. Encourage people to explore opportunities, develop their own gifts and let them have the chance to know them. Avoid the word \"CAN'T\" . Instead, substitute \"How can we\" ... or \"What if...?\" 25 Find the guidance, accountability, and focus that will allow you to make your dreams for the future a reality!Advocate - a person whose only role with the person with the disability or older adult is to assist in presenting the person's point of view and assisting the person in having informed choice Case manager/service worker - case manager/service workers are available throughout Iowa as a resource to people receiving servicesEligibility - meets conditions of the county and Iowa to receive funding for support services through the Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Program Employer-employee Agreement - the form that shows the specic service provided and the amount of services the person is buying from the providerEmpowered - feeling in control of one's own destiny Financial Management Service - a credit union or bank that holds the money from the individual budget and pays for goods and to those providing support Independent Support Broker - a person who provides information, helps people develop their personal plans and budgets, and arranges needed support within a person's individual budget Individual budget - a personalize blueprint for developing supports for the person that shows how they are going to buy services within their monthly allowance Invoice - a bill which shows the customer charges for goods delivered or work done Monthly allowance - the amount of money that will be sucient for individuals to purchase their needed supports Personal Network of Support - a group of people who care about a person with a disability or older adult and wants to assist with support on a long-term basisProvider agency - a company that provides support services to people with disabilities or older adultsQuality Assurance - a set of activities intended to monitor standards regarding support servicesReceipt - a written document proving that something was received and already paid forSelf-Advocate - a person needing support services who makes choices and decisions regarding his/her chosen lifestyleSupport team - the paid and unpaid people who assist the person receiving services Supports - the help that enables a person to live and work in the community Time card - the record of the hours worked by each employee 26Glossary of TermsFor additional copies See it online at the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise website http://www.ime.state.ia.us/HCBS/HCBSConsumerOptions.html Use it online or print your own copy For a printed copy, send your request to: IMEMemberServices@dhs.state.ia.us -Or- Call us at 1-800-338-8366 (toll free) or 515-725-1003 in the local Des Moines area "}
