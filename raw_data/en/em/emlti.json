This unprecedented university-wide effort has been informed by extensive conversations and input from across our three campuses. The Council's work has already helped shape a major piece of the university's strategic plan, \"Tufts: The Next 10 Years,\" which the Board of Trustees approved in November. One of the plan's four overarching themes calls for initiatives to engage and celebrate our commonalities and differences. A plurality of perspectives is essential to the continued excellence of our academic mission and to the success of our graduates, who will live and work in a multicultural society. The Council's report provides us, as a community, with specific, actionable recommendations to achieve greater diversity among our student body, faculty, and staff and to make Tufts University more inclusive and welcoming to all. Among the major recommendations is the hiring of a Chief Diversity Officer, who will report to the Provost and have a secondary reporting relationship to the Executive Vice President. Working in partnership with our academic and administrative leaders, the Chief Diversity Officer will help guide the implementation of the Council's recommendations across Tufts. A search committee is now in formation. The report also highlights the ongoing need for financial aid resources to ensure that talented students, regardless of their background or means, have access to a Tufts education. It is not enough to enroll a diverse student body, however. We must make certain that all our students thrive here and have opportunities to participate fully in the Tufts experience. The report offers recommendations for new ways to recruit and support exceptional undergraduate, graduate, and professional students who traditionally have not applied to Tufts, and to strengthen the campus climate. It also offers a roadmap for success in increasing faculty and staff diversity.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 4 CONTEXTWe extend our deepest thanks to all the community members who offered their ideas and input. The members of the Council and its three working groups showed tremendous dedication to Tufts. We are particularly grateful to the chairs of the working groups: Joyce Sackey, dean of multicultural affairs and global health at the School of Medicine and chair of the working group on the graduate and professional student experience; Sabrina Williams, director of human resources for the Boston and Grafton campuses and chair of the council's administrative structures and policies working group; and Adriana Zavala, associate professor of art history and chair of the working group on the undergraduate student experience. The responsibility for engendering a diverse and welcoming community lies with all of us. The Council's recommendations will help us advance these values as a community, and we look forward to working with you to achieve these shared goals. Best wishes, ANTHONY P. MONACO JOANNE BERGER-SWEENEY President Dean, School of Arts and Sciences Chair, Council on Diversity Vice Chair, Council on DiversityTufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 5 CONTEXTIntroduction and Common Themes Introduction The following report presents recommendations from the Council on Diversity with respect to students, faculty members, and staff as well as the university's mission and organizational structures. It highlights common themes that have emerged during the course of the Council's work and that have informed its consideration of specific topics concerning diversity and inclusion at Tufts. The recommendations include the development and definition of organizational structures and models intended to ensure their effective implementation. The Council was convened by President Anthony P . Monaco in March 2012 in recognition of a shared desire across the university community to make further progress on issues of diversity and inclusion at Tufts \u2014 issues that are challenging not just at Tufts, but across all of American higher education. The Council has worked over the past year and a half to understand and enhance our collective engagement with these issues and has already made integral contributions to the evolving strategic vision for Tufts' future, as is evident in the attention to these issues in the university-wide strategic plan, \"Tufts: The Next 10 Years (T10),\" recently approved by the Board of Trustees. The third of the four fundamental themes of the strategic plan, \"Engaging and Celebrating Commonalities and Differences,\" is summarized as follows: \"Over the next 10 years, Tufts will demonstrate unprecedented institutional commitment to diversity, inclusion and cultural competency. . . .\" The plan identifies implementing the recommendations of the Council on Diversity as one of the three key university initiatives associated with this strategic theme. Another initiative associated with this theme \u2014 enhancing graduate and undergraduate financial aid \u2014 is itself aligned with the Council's recommendations. The Council was charged with determining how Tufts might best recruit, retain, and nurture a diverse community of students, faculty, and staff, and with establishing how we might foster the cultural competence and attitudes necessary to support and sustain healthy and productive interactions both within and beyond such a diverse university community. More clearly defining and establishing the place of diversity in our institutional mission, and strengthening the diversity-related skills and sensibilities of our students, faculty, and staff, have emerged as top priorities for the university community. As social and technological developments make our world more interdependent, and increasingly bring together people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives, the relevance and success of higher education will hinge on an ability to reckon rigorously with the issues and concerns of diversity and inclusion. The Council believes that Tufts is well positioned to be an institutional leader and live up to its values in these areas. The Council has taken a broad view of the possible dimensions of diversity for consideration. Depending on the specific topics at issue, they have included but not been limited to race and ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, physical ability, religion, geographic origin and language background, and socioeconomic status.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 6 CONTEXTThe Council has aimed to consult broadly and deeply in order to understand the true current state of diversity at Tufts. Establishing three working groups that drew in additional community members with subject-matter expertise and varied perspectives, the Council conducted open conversations with students, faculty, and staff on all three campuses, as well as targeted discussions with administrators and other key stakeholders. The Council has reviewed current and past initiatives and inquiries related to diversity and inclusion, and has collected both quantitative and qualitative data on demographic trends, achievement metrics, climate satisfaction, and experiential accounts. Key data used by the Council are presented in Appendices H-K of this report; >> Appendix G provides an introduction to issues of data categorization and analysis. The Council's work extends the university's longstanding tradition of dedication to diversity and inclusion. Unlike most institutions of higher education, Tufts has aimed to be inclusive since its founding. The university's Universalist founders envisioned an institution that would embrace those at the margins of society, and offer admission to students from all cultures, religions, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The Council has drawn inspiration and insight from important previous efforts to assess and address issues of diversity and inclusion at Tufts. The 1997 report of the Task Force on Race represented a milestone in the university's history; more recently, in 2011, the faculty/staff/ student Equal Educational Opportunity Committee of the Schools of Arts and Sciences and Engineering offered thoughtful recommendations on improving diversity, climate, and inclusion. While the Council has learned a great deal from these earlier efforts, it has sought to take a fresh look at the full range of issues. It has made a particular commitment to the centrality of data and metrics in developing, implementing, and consistently monitoring the progress of its recommendations. Crucially, while previous efforts focused primarily on the undergraduate student experience on the Medford/Somerville campus, the Council has looked university-wide, developing recommendations concerning not only undergraduate students, but also graduate and professional students, faculty, and staff. Its efforts to assess the campus climate have included the first-ever comprehensive climate survey of all Tufts' graduate and professional students. The Council's university-wide approach to issues of diversity and inclusion is unprecedented in Tufts' history. The personal leadership of the Council by President Monaco as Chair and the Dean of Arts and Sciences as Vice Chair reflect a commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion that is shared across the university's senior leadership. The Council members share a hope that Tufts will live up to its promise as a place where anyone \u2014 of any creed, class, cultural background, race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual identity \u2014 will be able not only to gain access to education and opportunity, but also to feel empowered to contribute in a way that celebrates and calls upon the most important parts of his or her identity. The diversity and excellence of Tufts are inextricably linked together; only through rigorous inclusion can we achieve true success that is based on our collective potential as a community.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 7 CONTEXTCommon Themes The report that follows details findings and recommendations specific to each of the university's major campus constituencies: undergraduate students, graduate and professional students, faculty, and staff. It also outlines recommendations specific to the university's overall mission and central administrative organization. While this approach offers the best assurance of developing actionable recommendations, the Council is keenly aware of the interconnectedness of the issues. A number of common themes emerged in the course of the Council's work \u2014 notably the importance of climate and cultural competence, the need to be data-driven, the salience of financial aid and programs to support educational success, and opportunities to share best practices across the university more effectively. Climate and Cultural Competence Tufts is not immune to the climate issues in our society, particularly as these relate to historically marginalized individuals and groups, but Tufts has both an opportunity and a responsibility to address these issues on our campuses. The Council and its working groups believe that a campus climate that fosters diversity and inclusion is a collective responsibility of all members of the community: students, faculty, staff, and administrators. It cannot be the responsibility of any single individual or office. Given the fact that diversity is part of the academic mission at Tufts, it should be an explicit expectation that faculty and staff at Tufts will support this value, and do their part to advance it. The Council's specific recommendations with respect to faculty and staff reflect the importance of increasing their awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclusion. We have work to do if we are to ensure that all our students feel themselves full members of our educational community. Data It is imperative that the university develop a systematic data gathering and assessment protocol with respect to diversity and inclusion. Data collection, synthesis, and distribution are the most effective means to establishing benchmarks, assessing and developing effective policy interventions and programs, developing mechanisms for accountability, and tracking participation in and developing incentives to strengthen diversity and inclusion at Tufts. A \"diversity dashboard\" or annual report would increase accountability as well as enable us to celebrate successes. In developing their recommendations, the working groups worked closely with various university offices. During this process it became evident that although the university gathers data, the lack of a centralized database with clear protocols for the assessment and distribution of data resulted in uneven benchmarking and accountability. Furthermore, in some crucial areas data were gathered only sporadically, cross-sectional analysis was less than optimal, and data sharing was inadequately systematized. Thus the success of current programs and development of new programs and interventions were often not optimized. The working groups have identified key areas where better collection and use of data have the potential to significantly increase our understanding of the issues and our ability to design responses and assess their effectiveness.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 8 CONTEXTFinancial Aid and the Educational Experience Financial aid plays a critical role in making a Tufts education possible and attractive for a diverse cohort of students. Tufts has made significant progress in increasing financial aid resources in recent years, and the members of the Council and working groups appreciate the strong commitment shown by the administration, especially given the challenging economic climate. President Monaco announced in 2013 the launch of a financial aid initiative to raise $25 million in scholarship funds for students across the university over the next two years.1 As of December 2013, $22 million had been raised; $13 million of that is designated for undergraduate students alone as part of this initiative.2 Despite an already strong commitment to matriculate, support, and retain students with financial need to Tufts, along with new increases in targeted fundraising activities to support financial aid, the university needs to allocate even more funds to addressing the issues of access and equity that may prevent students from participating in the full Tufts experience. Recruiting students from racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds is only the first step in addressing issues of diversity, climate, and inclusion. We must ensure that our structures and programs ensure a successful transition, full participation, and success for all our students. Sharing Best Practices Tufts and its various schools and programs need to become more systematic and transparent in sharing best practices. The Council's working groups spent much time researching the activities related to diversity in the schools and found areas such as recruitment/retention and pipeline programs where the measured successes of very rich and fruitful programs were not shared across the schools. The sharing of information, and specifically best practices that have proven effective, presents a great opportunity for the university. The limited awareness of different initiatives to unify the student body is an obstacle to promoting a diverse and inclusive climate at Tufts. Many graduate students, for example, are unaware of career development programs, and effective modes of publicizing and disseminating university-wide resources and events such as the Graduate Student Council (GSC) Research Symposium should be established. How This Document Is Organized This report includes recommendations from the Council, developed by its three working groups. The body of the report focuses on overarching strategic recommendations. The appendices include supporting data and references as well as more detailed implementation recommendations. The report reflects thoughtful feedback from community consultation following the earlier release of draft recommendations on the undergraduate student experience (April 2013) and a full draft report (September 2013), as well as subsequent further deliberation including consideration of priorities, available resources, and alignment with the strategic directions identified in the university-wide strategic planning process.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 9 UNIVERSITY-WIDEUniversity-wide Recommendations University Mission After reviewing the missions of other institutions known for their commitment to diversity and inclusion, the Administrative Structures and Policies Working Group (ASPWG) recommended that Tufts' mission should convey a more contemporary approach to diversity issues, focusing on inclusion. This recommendation was reviewed as part of the strategic planning process and the revised university mission statement in the recently approved strategic plan articulates a strong commitment to inclusion. Chief Diversity Officer The university's Office of Institutional Diversity was established in 2007 and was active until the departure of the first Executive Director of Institutional Diversity for another institution in 2009. In light of impending senior leadership transitions, the position was held vacant and the office's responsibilities distributed pending a full review of options and strategies. The working group on Administrative Structures and Policies has conducted research on the models in place at peer institutions, other universities known for an effective commitment to diversity and inclusion, and corporations, as well as on the history of organizational structures to support diversity at Tufts. The Administrative Structures and Policies Working Group recommends the relaunch of central administrative oversight of issues and policies concerning institutional diversity through the appointment of a Chief Diversity Officer (CDO). In the model envisioned, the CDO would report to the Provost, with a secondary (dotted-line) reporting relationship to the Executive Vice President (see >> Appendix B ). The CDO would need to have experience leading large change-management initiatives, preferably in higher education, but does not necessarily need to have an academic background. The CDO might hold the title of Associate Provost, or another title of equivalent seniority; this individual's portfolio could include additional responsibilities. This individual's primary responsibilities as CDO would include: \u00b7Ensuring that the recommendations of the Council on Diversity are prioritized and operationalized. \u00b7Ensuring that staff across the university involved with diversity and inclusion issues and initiatives are working in a manner that is congruent and supportive of Tufts' mission and vision. \u00b7Overseeing defined central programmatic initiatives (e.g., graduate diversity recruitment). \u00b7Developing metrics applicable to both the university and individual schools and divisions, and possibly a scorecard, to ensure accountability, tracking, and monitoring of efforts. \u00b7Ensuring ongoing attention to metrics, benchmarking, and best practices with respect to diversity and inclusion. \u00b7Advising senior leaders centrally and within schools and divisions on issues of diversity and inclusion.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 10 UNIVERSITY-WIDE \u00b7Supervising program staff to be assigned to CDO projects in accordance with the overall staffing model within the Provost's Office. \u00b7Providing annual updates to the Academic and Administrative Councils, as well as regular updates to the Academic Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees. \u00b7Representing Tufts with external stakeholders including the community to ensure Tufts' commitment to diversity and inclusion extends beyond its campuses. In addition, the CDO would manage the work of the university-wide Council on Diversity in its next iteration. With a longer time horizon than the current Council, it would advise on strategy and key policy decisions as well as overseeing and evaluating the implementation of this Council's recommendations over time. Such a Council would meet two to three times per semester. The exact structure of such a Council is to be determined, but it would likely continue to be chaired by the President, with potential additional senior officer participation by the Provost and Executive Vice President. The Council would always include at least one vice president and at least one school dean, if not two (one from a school with undergraduates and one from a graduate or professional school). The CDO would be an ex officio member of the Council. Council membership would be staggered, with terms of two years to ensure continuity of efforts and leveraging of learning. Nominations for Council membership would come from deans, vice presidents, or self-nomination. We support following the current Council's existing model of broad representation, including Tisch College given its strong interest in diversity as a core civic skill, while recognizing the challenges of having too large of a committee. The working groups encourage linking the Council to faculty governance in the Schools of Arts and Sciences and Engineering, through ex officio membership of the Chair of the Equal Educational Opportunity Committee or other appropriate representation. The membership of this Council should include undergraduate and graduate students as well as members of the faculty and administration. The CDO should also be asked to establish a separate coordinating committee, meeting five to six times per year, that brings together key administrators and faculty members from across the university with responsibilities related to diversity and inclusion. This committee would work to implement, evaluate, and address issues of diversity and inclusion in an ongoing and direct manner. To ensure coordination and accountability, the Provost and Executive Vice President should ask each school and division to identify a senior leader with oversight/coordination responsibility for diversity efforts as part of his/her portfolio. This already happens formally or informally in many schools and divisions, but should happen systematically throughout the university. With respect to the administrative functions that previously reported to the Office of Institutional Diversity, the Administrative Structures and Policies Working Group endorses the reporting relationship of the Office of Equal Opportunity to University Relations, with strong connections to both Human Resources and the Office of the President.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 11 UNDERGRADUATEUndergraduate Student Experience Context In order to better understand the undergraduate student experience, the Council's Undergraduate Student Experience Working Group (UWG) consulted a range of sources, both quantitative and qualitative, gathered through the Office of Institutional Research and Evaluation (OIR&E), from offices that serve our students, and in a variety of forums with faculty members, staff, and students in the Schools of Arts and Sciences and Engineering. The UWG's recommendations are focused on campus climate; the undergraduate academic experience including student-faculty interactions both inside and beyond the classroom; the co-curricular experience; data on financial aid, equity, and student achievement; and our assessment of the protocols in place for data gathering, synthesis, and distribution, as well as benchmarking and accountability. The UWG found that there is a great deal of positive work taking place at Tufts, much of it under the auspices of the Group of Six (Africana, Asian American, Latino, LGBT, International, and Women's Centers) regarding diversity and inclusion. At the same time, there are also significant opportunities for improvement not just in terms of the compositional diversity of the undergraduate student population, but also crucially in terms of the campus climate and access to the full array of opportunities at the university. Among our graduating seniors, those from historically underrepresented groups report the lowest levels of overall satisfaction with their undergraduate education. Barriers to equal educational and co-curricular opportunities remain for students from historically underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and these barriers appear to be not only financial but also academic and cultural. Students of color and women both report less access to participation in faculty research. For an institution that prides itself on promoting student participation in faculty research, this finding suggests that awareness of these barriers needs to be communicated to the faculty. Additionally, resources and training to increase multicultural competency in our faculty are crucial so that they can create more inclusive classroom cultures and mentoring relationships. According to the Tufts Senior Survey 2011, there has been a decline since 2007 in terms of whether our graduating seniors who are non-resident alien, Asian, Hispanic, or Black or African American would choose Tufts again if given the opportunity to relive their college experience.3 Our seniors also reported lower levels than their peers elsewhere of understanding the complexity of social problems, ability to identify moral and ethical issues, and development of global awareness.4 Given Tufts' self-identification as an institution that prioritizes international and global awareness, this raises concerns.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 12 UNDERGRADUATEThe most distressing finding with respect to academics is the fact that first-generation, low-income, and historically underrepresented minority students still encounter obstacles to academic achievement in comparison with their White peers. Data on academic achievement gathered at the request of the UWG suggest that policy interventions and programs currently in place at the university are inadequate. It is important, however, to underscore that studies show that racial and ethnic disparities in college completion and achievement are not exclusive to Tufts but are national problems.5 Despite the challenges, the UWG is encouraged that having gathered these data, the senior administration is committed to finding answers, developing new strategies, and implementing new programs to address the disparities. The university must strive to enhance programs to support all our students but especially first-generation, low-income, and historically underrepresented minorities and otherwise marginalized students so that they may be empowered and attain the norms of social capital essential for accessing the full array of opportunities, and so that they may achieve their full potential academically, as members of our community and of the global world beyond Tufts. Findings and Recommendations Campus Climate, Community Values, and Communications Tufts is not immune to the climate issues in our society, particularly as these relate to historically marginalized individuals and groups, but Tufts has an opportunity and a responsibility to address these issues on our campus. Furthermore, campus climate is the responsibility of all members of the community: students, faculty, staff, and administrators. FINDINGS \u00b7Data gathered indicate that students from historically marginalized groups dispropor - tionately experience marginalization in and outside of the classroom and also experience incidents of bias on our campus. At Tufts, as elsewhere in higher education, these groups as well as the administrative offices and academic units that focus on diversity, identity, and social justice are often charged with perpetuating self-segregation. The data, how - ever, indicate otherwise: LGBTQ students and students of color at Tufts are actually more likely than their heterosexual and White peers to engage in interactions across racial/ ethnic groups and social classes.6 \u00b7Units and offices that focus on diversity, identity, and social justice provide space for cross-group interaction as well as make a positive difference for students in terms of diversity, climate, and inclusion at Tufts.7 \u00b7Historically, communication about issues of diversity and inclusion has not been system - atic with respect to either existing initiatives or incidents of discrimination, bias, or sexual assault. Administration decision-making and procedural, structural, and programmatic changes have been perceived as insufficiently transparent.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 13 UNDERGRADUATERECOMMENDATION Create a climate that recognizes commonalities while understanding, engaging, and celebrating differences. \u00b7A focus on engaging students from historically privileged and historically marginalized backgrounds alike around issues of diversity and inclusion will serve to address and shift campus climate, while preparing all of our students to be global citizens. \u00b7The UWG recommends that the university reframe the conversation about diversity and inclusion to engage all members of a community in the consideration of the multiple identities we each have and how the intersections of these identities relate to power, privilege, and oppression both locally and globally. See >> Appendix C : Undergraduate Student Experience Implementation Recommendations for more information. Curriculum and Academic Support The curriculum must serve as a key focal point for any plan that addresses diversity in our academic community. The university should continue working actively to ensure that differential high school experiences do not put us at risk of a two-tier system of academic achievement. We must create venues and mechanisms for faculty members and departments to explore and exchange ideas and experiences regarding different aspects of diversity and how these affect the curriculum, the classroom and campus life. FINDINGS \u00b7In response to the COFHE 2012 Senior Survey, Tufts' graduating seniors, and especially males, reported lower levels than their peers elsewhere of understanding of social prob - lems, ability to identify moral and ethical issues, and development of global awareness.8 See also Findings and Recommendations: Faculty (page 29). \u00b7At the Diversity Luncheon held for graduating seniors in May 2012 and attended by ap - proximately 100 students, the curriculum emerged as a topic. While over 20% of partici - pants identified a curricular experience focused in some way on social justice as one that had been a positive in their experience of diversity while at Tufts, close to one-quarter felt the need for some formalized way to address diversity in the curriculum.9 This dovetails with one of the key points made in the T10 Strategic Plan: that, \"We consider cultural competency, fluent interactions with different people and perspectives, to be an essential component of higher education in the 21st century. In terms of basic preparation, personal experience with navigating issues of diversity, and exposure to different cultures and contexts, are increasingly important for all students. . . .\" \u00b7While 53% of White students at Tufts participate in Study Abroad, only 30% of Black/ African American students do so; while these rates of participation exceed those at peer schools, the university must ensure that all barriers to participation are understood and addressed. For example, 32% of Black/African American students report forgoing study abroad due to financial reasons.10Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 14 UNDERGRADUATE \u00b7The Retention Report from 2012 shows a significantly lower six-year graduation rate for historically underrepresented students (Black/African American: 84.1%, Hispanic 82.7%) than Asian (94.4%) and White (94.2% students). \u00b7The academic success of students from historically underrepresented minorities, and especially Black/African American and Hispanic students, is a source of concern nation - wide across college and university campuses. The Teagle Report of 2006 is one of many that illustrates that racial and ethnic disparities in college achievement and completion are not exclusive to Tufts but are national problems.11 RECOMMENDATION The Tufts curriculum should reflect the university's commitment to scholarship; open, respectful dialogue; and active citizenship. We recommend a review of the curriculum with focused attention to this commitment to ensure it meets the needs of students in a changing world and educational community. \u00b7We recommend a multipronged and multidisciplinary approach to supporting a common curricular experience during the first year that promotes mentored dialogue, scholarly engagement and practice on issues of diversity, inclusion, and social justice. \u00b7An array of courses that incorporate such an approach would prepare our graduates to be educated, engaged citizens. Faculty will need support and guidance in developing more inclusive pedagogical methods and developing new content within their fields re - lated to diversity inclusion and social justice. See also Findings and Recommendations: Faculty (page 29). \u00b7While a small percentage of students already engage in dialogue and action around issues of social justice, incorporating reflection and action into the curriculum more widely would make this an important component of every Tufts student's education. See >> Appendix C : Undergraduate Student Experience Implementation Recommendations. \u00b7As new learning technologies are explored, including distance learning programs, attention must be given to ensure that all students have the skills and tools required to access these technologies and resources equally. \u00b7The university should gather and synthesize data on achievement in order to implement and optimize structures to support all our students, including assessing whether current interventions have been effective. \u00b7We see opportunities to make further progress, both financial and administrative, in increasing access to foreign study opportunities for all students. Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 15 UNDERGRADUATEFaculty-Student Mentoring Student interactions with faculty members are one area in which disparities between the experiences of different groups of students are quite evident. These can include critical experiences such as microaggressions in the classroom.12 Students also report unequal opportunities to participate in research (whether on a research project or as an independent study), and varying overall comfort levels with faculty members.13 We must train the faculty to model the values of the university to our community. More information can be found in the \"Faculty\" sections of this report. FINDINGS \u00b7Although disparate experiences in a given area (e.g., participating in research with a faculty member) may not be evident for all ethnic minorities or otherwise marginalized in - dividuals, patterns suggest that Black/African American and Hispanic students experience disparities in the most areas. Put in the broader context of comparison to peer schools, underrepresented minority students at Tufts were the least satisfied with opportunities to participate in research, and least satisfied with the availability of faculty members outside of the classroom.14 \u00b7Focus group data from multiple Tufts sources point to classroom-based problems with addressing or supporting diversity; insufficient training of faculty members to promote effective pre-major advising and overall mentoring; insufficient knowledge/appreciation of power dynamics between faculty members and students; and students feeling silenced, in - side and beyond the classroom, by racist/sexist comments or other forms of discriminatory behavior. See also Findings and Recommendations: Faculty (page 29). \u00b7Students have also expressed, consistently, a desire for more proactive engagement and response from the administration and leadership from above on these issues.15 RECOMMENDATION Increase faculty and staff awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclusion through professional development programs. \u00b7Make a greater effort to instill an understanding in the faculty as to how the pres-ence or absence of inclusion and equity impact the lives of all our students, not just in terms of campus climate and co-curricular activities, but also in terms of the classroom dynamic and the curriculum. \u00b7Provide training opportunities for faculty members and incentives for participation in curricular development and co-curricular programming that foster diversity, inclusion, and empowerment.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 16 UNDERGRADUATEAccess and Equity in Financial Aid Tufts has made significant progress in increasing financial aid resources and the administration should be commended for this strong commitment, especially given the challenging economic climate. Following President Monaco's announcement that Tufts would launch a financial aid initiative to raise $25 million in scholarship funds for students across the university over the next two years, as of December 2013, $22 million had already been raised as part of this initiative, with $13 million of that designated for undergraduate students. Despite an already strong commitment to matriculate, support, and retain students with financial need to Tufts, along with new increases in targeted fundraising activities to support financial aid, additional resources are needed to allow the university to address issues of access and equity that may prevent students from participating in the full Tufts experience. FINDINGS \u00b7Developing a more robust financial aid budget would enable the recruitment, matriculation, and retention of students from historically underrepresented backgrounds, but additional financial resources are needed to develop the structures and programs to ensure a suc - cessful transition, full participation, and success for these students and for the rest of the student population. \u00b754% of Black/African American students report working for pay during their first year at Tufts, while only 25% of White students work during this time.16 While these students are working, they may be losing the opportunity to participate in important educational oppor - tunities outside of the classroom, including unpaid internships, co-curricular activities, and community engagement. \u00b782% of Black/African American and 51% of Hispanic seniors at Tufts report having borrowed substantially to pay for their undergraduate education, compared with 40% of White students. \u00b732% of Black/African American students report forgoing study abroad due to financial reasons.17Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 17 UNDERGRADUATERECOMMENDATION Increase and ensure access to resources that support all aspects of a Tufts education for a more diverse student population. \u00b7Recruiting students from racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds is only the first step in addressing issues of diversity, climate, and inclusion on our campus. In order to thrive academically and socially, these students must also have access to ongoing programmatic support services and, in some cases, financial resources beyond tuition, room, board, and fees to help them attain the norms of social capital. The university must strive to empower all students to access all elements of the Tufts experience. It is also crucial that programs implemented or designed to support our students be regularly assessed for success. \u00b7The Classes of 2011 and 2012 were admitted to Tufts using need-blind admissions practic - es due to specifically designated gifts made to the corresponding capital campaign. While there was never an official need-blind admissions policy at Tufts, and therefore no policy change for the Class of 2013 and beyond, the financial crisis made these need-blind prac - tices unfeasible to continue after the 2008 admissions cycle.18 While achieving need-blind admissions may not be a realistic goal, the university must strive to more closely match its peer institutions by increasing the level of financial aid for students. Co-Curricular Experience It is fundamental to the future development of both Tufts as an institution and its students that all undergraduates are able to fully navigate and become part of the Tufts community. Diversity is quality. Members of historically marginalized groups help shape the philosophy, mission, and culture of any institution or organization, and their interactions with faculty members and students help mold individual perspectives and foster intellectual curiosity. Our common goal should not only be to create a compositionally diverse community, but also to support all members of that community, especially our students, so that they can thrive at Tufts. FINDINGS \u00b7Demographic data on the undergraduate student population show that Tufts has plateaued in terms of enrolling students from historically underrepresented minority groups. Certainly Tufts faces competition in attracting these students but this also suggests a need to ad - dress the university's appeal for these students. As noted by the T10 Student Experience Working Group, obstacles to attaining a high-quality, unified student experience remain.19 A key area of concern is the continuing need to further enhance purposeful features of the co-curricular experience in particular. \u00b7Presently, first-generation, low-income, and historically underrepresented and otherwise marginalized students report experiencing disparities across a wide range of areas, from having to shoulder the responsibility for creating an inclusive campus climate, to Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 18 UNDERGRADUATEexperiencing emotional distress that distracts them from their academic mission, to barri - ers to the full array of resources as a result of financial constraints or a diminished sense of empowerment and social capital.20 \u00b7Through fall semester 2012, the AS&E Diversity Fund provided resources for faculty mem - bers, staff, and students to propose and develop ad-hoc programming that fostered diversity on campus. The fund was an important resource for encouraging such programming. RECOMMENDATION Review the undergraduate co-curricular experience with focused attention to issues of diversity and inclusion. \u00b7The university must strive to create a purposeful undergraduate experience from admission to matriculation through graduation. The creation of an intentional co-curric - ular experience that nurtures acceptance of diverse ideological viewpoints, socio-eco - nomic status, racial/ethnic makeup, religious beliefs, sexual orientation and equity, empowerment, and resilience must be prioritized. The undergraduate experience must include deliberate, structured opportunities for engagement across differences within the university community, as well as opportunities for personal development. Such an intentional co-curricular experience must be designed to engage students from both historically privileged and historically marginalized communities. \u00b7Undergraduate students should live together in a purposeful community specifically dedicated to their academic adjustment and successful transition to Tufts University. We believe it is critical to understand the roles played by both Greek Life and Athletics in that purposeful community. \u00b7Assess funding structure for purposeful programming around relevant topics planned by faculty members, staff, and students; revitalize and restructure the Diversity Fund to optimize the intellectual coherence of funded programs with the goal of shifting programming from diversity and difference to programs that engage more concretely with social justice frameworks.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 19 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONALGraduate and Professional Student Experience Context Tufts University has a longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion. Despite this commitment, there is a consensus that more can be done to increase student body diversity among Tufts' graduate and professional schools. Overall, Tufts is on the low end among peer institutions in the percentage of Black or African American and Hispanic students in its graduate and first-professional degree programs. (See >> Appendix I and NCES Peer Institution Data and NCES Peer Institution Data and Graphs for more information). The Graduate and Professional Student Experience Working Group (GPWG) has been examining Tufts' accomplishments and developing recommendations for strategies to enhance diversity and inclusion among its graduate and professional student community. A significant accomplishment of the Council on Diversity was the first climate survey ever administered to all graduate and professional students at Tufts. This survey provided a comprehensive perspective not available from the climate surveys administered in individual schools. (The survey is hereafter referred to as the Graduate Climate Survey.) The results of that survey form the basis for the findings presented in this section. The survey had a response rate of 28.4% (N=1,404 out of 4,950), and the distribution of respondents by gender and school was representative of Tufts University. The survey questions can be found in >> Appendix I . Findings and Recommendations Recruitment and Retention While Tufts' graduate and professional schools receive levels of applications from diverse populations of students comparable to their peers, the matriculation rates are lower than expected. Individual schools have identified a variety of reasons for their yield. It does not appear that every individual program and school sets diversity as a goal with performance that is assessed on a regular basis. As a result, performance across the university is very uneven. For example, at the Sackler School, three programs (Immunology, MSTP , and Microbiology) have succeeded in diverse recruitment and retention for many years. It is probably not a coincidence that NIH T32 Training Grants support these three more successful programs, since obtaining and retaining NIH funding requires success in diverse student recruitment and retention. In another example, the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning in the School of Arts and Sciences instituted a recruitment initiative, the Neighborhood Fellows Program, involving tuition remission for professional practitioners of color in its Master of Public Policy program. Since 2006 more than 37 of these practical visionaries, mostly Black, Latino, and Asian, have been recruited and graduated, and continue to work with current graduate students in a range of community settings. Many other Tufts programs, however, rarely recruit diverse students and have poor matriculation rates and weak graduation rates.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 20 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONALThe diversity of our faculty and staff are key elements that help inform the vibrancy of our community at Tufts. This diversity climate, in turn, can aid or hinder our efforts to recruit, teach, mentor, and graduate a diverse student body. Given the central role faculty and staff diversity plays in the graduate and professional students' community, the GPWG considered strategies for ensuring that Tufts attracts and retains a vibrant and diverse group of faculty members and staff. More information can be found in the \"Faculty\" and \"Staff\" sections of this report. FINDINGS \u00b7Tufts representation at the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) has been limited to representatives from the Health Sciences Campus. To en - sure a strong diversity process, schools and departments must reach out regularly through visits to campuses, and through attendance at large recruiting fairs and other gatherings. These visits will not only identify recruits for the future, but also serve as channels of information and access to best practices in furthering diversity. Further, schools and departments should be tracking promising potential graduate students and fellows from diverse populations and reaching out so that they feel they will be welcomed to the Tufts community years before they enter the job market. \u00b7Mentoring of faculty members with respect to diversity is discussed more fully below, but those involved in student recruitment must be appropriately trained. For instance, many Sackler School admissions committee members at the program level have never received training with respect to diverse student populations, have never had their implicit assump - tions tested, and never studied which parameters are the best predictors of success in graduate school. \u00b7Tufts does have a number of recruitment resources worth highlighting. The GPWG was particularly impressed by collaboration across Tufts around graduate recruitment promot - ed by the Office of the Provost, which launched the Graduate and Professional Student Admissions Recruitment Committee (GAPSARC) in 2004 to promote graduate diversity initiatives university-wide. GAPSARC is a university-wide committee of administrators and faculty members actively involved in the recruitment of graduate and professional students from underrepresented groups, chaired by the Associate Director of Graduate Diversity Programs. \u00b7GAPSARC allows graduate schools to share resources and develop best practices for the benefit of the individual schools. The Office of the Provost provides funds and adminis - trative support for joint initiatives to facilitate individual schools' recruiting efforts, not to replace or supersede them. It is up to each school to utilize the resources provided by GAPSARC to the school's benefit. \u00b7The biennial Prospective Graduate Student Days sponsored by GAPSARC showcase Tufts' graduate schools to academically vetted prospective students from traditionally underrep - resented groups, as well as first-generation students and students from economically disad - vantaged backgrounds. The participants are vetted primarily through pre-graduate prepara - tory programs such as the Leadership Alliance and the McNair Scholars Program, although applications are accepted from students not associated with these types of programs.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 21 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL \u00b7The Prospective Graduate Student Days allow the graduate and professional schools to provide a more comprehensive, targeted, and concentrated recruiting experience on all of Tufts' campuses. Over a two-day period prospective students participate in departmental events, financial aid presentations, and information sessions. The Provost's Office aug - ments this experience through sponsored activities including a reception, campus tours, and an informational lunch. Individually, the graduate schools develop activities where stu - dents have opportunities to network with current graduate students and faculty members from various departments and to learn about funding, housing, campus climate, and living in the greater Boston area. To date, over 225 diverse students have attended. \u00b7Tufts University is a consortium member of The Leadership Alliance, a successful recruit - ment model that systematically mentors talented, underrepresented, and underserved individuals at all stages of the higher education pipeline into positions in academia and the public and private sectors, offering support at each step of the academic pathway. \u00b7The cost of a Tufts education appears to be a significant factor in recruitment results for professional and non-doctoral programs. In particular, the types and amount of financial assistance Tufts is able to extend to qualified applicants, in comparison to aid packages they are able to receive elsewhere, contributes to our low matriculation rate. \u00b7An additional financial burden that extends to graduate and professional education is the cost of applying (application fees, visiting Tufts for interviews or a second look, etc.). The GPWG found wide variation among graduate programs with regards to strategies to minimize these barriers. For instance, some but not all of Tufts' graduate and professional schools provide application fee waivers for applicants from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. See >> Appendix I for more information. Other strategies include travel grants for admitted students from diverse backgrounds who are in the decision process, as at The Fletcher School. Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 22 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONALRECOMMENDATION Eliminate barriers to application and increase rates of matriculation. \u00b7Each program should aim to eliminate barriers in the application process, including the financial barriers associated with applying for admission. \u00b7Schools and programs should increase efforts to enhance rates of matriculation at Tufts. One key step toward this is increasing scholarship funds to enhance our ability to offer competitive financial aid packages to accepted students. We also need to explore other means of reducing student indebtedness, including expanding our loan repayment assistance program for graduates in public sector and not-for-profit em - ployment, educating students about external funding sources to which they may apply, and educating students about alternative ways of financing graduate and professional school education, such as the National Health Services Corps. \u00b7Each school and graduate program should ensure it has an administrative structure in place to promote student retention, advancement, and support. The GPWG believes that careful monitoring of indicators of students' success, including graduation rates, years to completion of degree programs, and number of authored publications, should occur as a matter of course for every graduate program. Analysis of the data for any trends that may highlight students who might benefit from more intensive support will ensure that all students who matriculate at Tufts enjoy the same chances of success. \u00b7If Tufts intends to increase the diversity of its student population, it will need to have a diverse faculty. We cannot expect students to feel comfortable and at home if they do not find their own identities reflected in the composition of the faculty. Student Pipeline Development Pipeline programs \u2014 programs that provide academic enrichment, mentored research internship, etc. for pre-professional and pre-graduate students \u2014 are widely seen as an effective strategy for expanding the applicant pool. Many of these programs target students from educationally and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. For these students, participation in such a program may determine whether they are ready or not to attend graduate and professional schools. Thus, pipeline programs have the potential to increase the diversity of the applicant pool. Tufts University already boasts a wide range of pipeline programs, targeting students at various levels of the educational system; we should capitalize on these initiatives. FINDINGS \u00b7The Sackler School has a summer research opportunity for college students, Building Diversity in Biomedical Sciences (BDBS). Students participating in the BDBS program are sophomores and juniors who wish to acquire research experience prior to applying to PhD or MD/PhD degree programs. Students are paired with faculty mentors on the Boston campus, where they spend the summer engaged in research, as well as in workshops aimed at increasing the students' skills for applying to graduate school.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 23 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL \u00b7The Post-baccalaureate Research Education Policy (PREP) program of the Sackler School provides a mentored research experience for recent college graduates who wish to strengthen their candidacy for acceptance to a biomedical research PhD program. \u00b7The Masters of Biomedical Science (MBS) program at the medical school offers recent col - lege graduates an opportunity to strengthen their candidacy as applicants to medical school. \u00b7The Fletcher School has participated successfully in a number of pipeline programs for students interested in graduate studies in international affairs or public policy. \u00b7As noted previously under Recruitment and Retention, Tufts participates in The Leadership Alliance, another successful pipeline model. Within this 32-institution consortium, Tufts has the unique distinction of having two separate Summer Research Early Identification Programs (SR-EIP). The STEM, Humanities, and Social Science program resides on the Medford campus and the Biomedical Sciences program resides on the Boston campus. Currently, three former Leadership Alliance Medford site alumni are currently enrolled in graduate programs at Tufts University. The SR-EIP also has a cohort for Humanities and Social Science students known as The Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative (LAMI) on the Medford/Somerville campus where students in the humanities and social sciences also participate in summer research. While disciplines in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have historically hosted students for the LAMI program, in 2013 the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy hosted its first Leadership Alliance students. RECOMMENDATION Capitalize on preexisting excellent pipeline programs. \u00b7Tufts should capitalize on the existence of excellent pipeline programs and encourage cross-programming among them. \u00b7There is a need for a coordinated tracking mechanism that allows Tufts to better mon - itor the progress of students who participate in its pipeline programs. Such monitoring will provide a number of benefits, including allowing us to monitor students for their successful entry into graduate and/or professional degree programs, providing the opportunity to highlight success, sharing best practices within and outside the Tufts community, and providing the critical data we need in order to convince funding sources to sustain funding for these programs. Quality of the Educational Experience Tufts graduate and professional students are generally happy with their educational experience. Exit interviews and surveys, such as the AS&E Exit Survey and the AAMC graduation questionnaire for graduating medical students, all report a high level of satisfaction among students with their Tufts education. The levels of satisfaction reported in these surveys remain high when results are analyzed by gender or race. The findings presented in this section are based on the results of the Graduate Climate Survey.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 24 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONALFINDINGS \u00b7In the climate survey administered to all Tufts students by the GPWG, respondents were asked to rate a series of statements regarding their satisfaction with academic advising. Tables in >> Appendix I show the results. Overall, close to 75% of students agreed or strongly agreed that their schools had met their specific academic needs. Students from the LGBTQ community expressed the greatest satisfaction with their academic advising experience. \u00b7Although the level of satisfaction with the quality of the educational experience at Tufts is high, there is room for improvement both in achieving greater student satisfaction and in acquiring data consistently across all graduate and professional schools at Tufts, including data on other dimensions of diversity besides gender and race. In addition, there is room for improvement when it comes to curricular offerings relating to cross-cultural education, including topics relating to underserved communities, cultural competency education and racial and ethnic variations in health, education, and social determinants of health. The Food Justice Curriculum inventory developed by JEFF, a student group at the Friedman School, provides one example. RECOMMENDATION Promote a diverse and inclusive learning community where students are supported to explore issues of diversity personally and learn from others. \u00b7Tufts should capitalize on its increasing diversity by promoting a diverse and inclusive learning community where students are supported to explore issues of diversity person - ally and learn from each other's different backgrounds as part of their Tufts experience. \u00b7Tufts should increase the awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclu-sion in faculty and staff through training that instills an understanding in the faculty as to how inclusion and equity, or the lack thereof, impact the lives of students in terms of campus climate, the classroom dynamic, the curriculum, and co-curricular activities. \u00b7Provide training opportunities for faculty members and incentives to participate in curric - ular and co-curricular programming that fosters diversity, inclusion, and empowerment. \u00b7To ensure that it is equipping students with skills that ensure success in a culturally diverse community within and beyond Tufts, these skills should be included as learning objectives in discipline- and program-specific outcomes assessment programs. \u00b7Efforts to increase faculty diversity must be intensified in order to attract a more diverse student population. Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 25 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONALStudent Support and Networks The data in this section are drawn from the results of the Graduate Climate Survey. FINDINGS \u00b7In the survey ( >> Appendix I ), mentoring was addressed separately from formal academic advising to obtain a more complete picture on where and how students seek guidance. The survey instrument defined a mentor as \"a more senior person within student's training environment with a sustained on-going relationship with the student. A mentor promotes professional development by discussing student's goals, needs, weaknesses and accom - plishments.\" The survey results show that the number of students with a mentor ranges from roughly 45% to 60%, depending on the student group being considered, which sug - gests that there is room for improvement. \u00b7The fraction of graduate and professional students with mentees was found to be very low. Encouraging students to become mentors is essential not only to enhance their educational experience, but also to nurture the academic environment university-wide. When asked who their mentees are, the majority of answers were \"another student\" or \"an undergraduate student.\" \u00b7Most students regardless of background indicated they felt comfortable interacting with students at their school. This is not the case, however, when interacting with students at other Tufts schools. Forty-three percent of graduate and professional students felt Tufts' climate is comfortable for them to interact with students outside their school, while 19% reported the climate is not comfortable to interact with student outside their school (38% replied \"somewhat comfortable\"). These percentages do not fluctuate much when the data is analyzed through the lenses of gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, or socioeconom - ic status; however, 38% of students with disabilities felt the climate was comfortable, and 43% felt the climate was somewhat comfortable. Students from Cummings, Friedman, and GSAS found it least comfortable to interact with students from other Tufts schools. This suggests that improving the climate at Tufts is needed to encourage these interactions. \u00b7While there is a wide array of student services and resources at Tufts, such as career development services and writing clinics, the knowledge of these resources is not ubiqui - tous. It is apparent from the survey results and general feedback that students are often not aware of these services and resources. For example, a large portion (41.9%) of the students who indicated they had never accessed career planning or professional develop - ment resources stated that they were \"not aware [they were] available.\" \u00b7Of those students reporting having a disability, 52.6% answered \"no\" when asked if they had \"self-identified to a person in the university that [they] were a person with [disability].\" An overwhelming majority of students (73.4%) indicating disabilities have not requested accommodations for their disability. However, 80.5% of those that have requested accom - modations were satisfied with them. Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 26 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL \u00b7Through the Associate Director of Graduate Diversity Programs, the Provost's Office has implemented several programs that help address the needs of graduate students of color and help those interested in diversity build a sense of community across the campuses. Activities include the following: \u00b7The Provost's Diversity Reception, which takes place each semester and is open to all graduate students, brings together diverse graduate students from across the campuses in a social and networking atmosphere. It has become a much-anticipated event among graduate students, and attendance has increased each year. \u00b7Closely associated with the Provost's Diversity Reception is the Multi-Ethnic Graduate Alliance (MEGA), founded in 2009 to involve graduate students from across the campuses in diverse recruiting strategies, social events, and assisting with summer research. MEGA students frequently work with local recruiting and the mentoring of Leadership Alliance students. RECOMMENDATION Increase mentoring opportunities and review other student support services. \u00b7Increase school-specific mentoring opportunities for graduate and professional stu- dents, implement approaches to encourage graduate and professional students to become mentors, enhance awareness of the importance of mentoring relationships, and provide graduate and professional students with the skills to become effective mentors \u2014 The student experience may be greatly enriched through mentoring. Based on the survey results, only half of the student body has a mentor. This number needs to increase for student groups of all backgrounds. \u00b7Develop student mentoring programs where graduate and professional students have the opportunity to become mentors to their peers, undergraduate students, or high school students, and establish school-specific systems that enhance peer support. These programs would benefit from a connection with pipeline development programs. \u00b7Develop strategies to disseminate information about student support services to ensure that students are aware of the roles of student services and the availability of these resources. Ensure that information is explicit when resources are school-specific. \u00b7Evaluate the merits of establishing university-wide student support services, and estab - lish effective modes of communication and dissemination of university-wide resources and events: If school-specific resources do not have the capacity to cater to students from other schools, the university should consider establishing or expanding those resources on a university-wide scale. \u00b7The university should be attentive to the ways that issues of work-life balance can affect the quality of the Tufts experience for graduate and professional students as well as faculty and staff, particularly as they may impact the success of students from diverse populations and non-traditional backgrounds.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 27 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONALBeyond Graduation: Career Support and Advancement Services The working group learned that there are a number of resources at Tufts aimed at equipping students with the skills they need to embark upon their career journey beyond Tufts. However, these resources are rarely available to graduate and professional students outside the specific school where they are offered. Such skills development resources include, but are not limited to, negotiation skills workshops at The Fletcher School, the Graduate Institute for Teaching at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and workshops on conflict resolution in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and at Fletcher. FINDINGS \u00b7Currently, there is significant variation in the scope and scale of career development ser - vices offered by different graduate and professional schools at Tufts. The working group recognizes that some variation may appropriately reflect the varying needs of students and graduates in different fields. \u00b7The Graduate Climate Survey results indicate that professional and graduate students have an overall usage rate for career services of less than 50%. This may reflect inconsistent services between schools, lack of services, and communication. The schools vary widely in their support: Some do not have a single staff member dedicated solely to career services. This inconsistency creates confusion among students who view themselves as students of Tufts University and therefore do not understand why they cannot use other schools' career services \u2014 especially given the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of Tufts. \u00b7The survey results suggest that faculty members and mentors play an important role in career advising. It is important, therefore, to ensure that all students have access to early and effective mentoring. We strongly recommend that all faculty members who serve in mentoring roles for students be provided with the opportunity for faculty development and acquire skills necessary to be successful mentors. This will minimize variations in the quality of mentoring. There should also be an evaluation process that allows for the iden - tification of deficient mentoring and appropriate intervention. At the same time, exemplary mentors should be recognized by the institution. RECOMMENDATION Review career services across school and offer a common core of services. \u00b7We recommend a comprehensive review across schools to ensure that all graduate and professional students have access to and receive the same caliber, depth, and variety of career services, including a common core of services that transcend differences between schools and programs, in addition to services specific to particular disciplines and schools. \u00b7Tufts needs to have a uniform university-wide mechanism to capture and analyze long-term outcomes for its students. Without this it is impossible to assess the effective - ness of our practice.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 28 GRADUATE/PROFESSIONALCommunity Engagement and Partnership Community engagement is a vital resource for strengthening diversity and inclusion in Tufts' graduate education with an impact on society. Community engagement contributes powerfully to the success of all students, whatever their backgrounds, with respect to recruitment, retention, research innovation, and learning outcomes. FINDINGS \u00b7For some students, especially those from diverse backgrounds, community engagement may be a welcome source of validation and connection to a larger, familiar community. \u00b7For others, community engagement exposes them to socioeconomic and other disparities connected to their graduate focus. \u00b7For all students, community engagement provides the opportunity to identify research questions, direct experience with underserved populations, and a structured context for learning about community issues. In this way, graduate and professional students gain new approaches and cultural competencies to work more effectively with classmates, potential clients, and broader society \u2014 a key civic learning outcome for all Tufts students. \u00b7Community partners greatly value the higher-level expertise and professionalism that Tufts graduate and professional students bring to their partnerships. \u00b7Most important, campus-community networks provide support for graduate students' success and increase their ability to have an impact on society. RECOMMENDATION Develop new and increase existing programs that support community engagement by students. \u00b7All graduate and professional programs should develop programs to effectively support community engagement by graduate students. This could become a key differentiator for Tufts, consistent with its mission and value of having an impact on society. \u00b7Routine graduate student surveys administered by each school should include questions to assess the amount and nature of community engagement graduate students under - take, and its impact on them with respect to diversity and inclusion.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 29 FACULTYFaculty Context As mentioned in this report's Introduction, the Council on Diversity created three working groups aligned with the undergraduate and graduate and professional student populations and the administrative structure of the university. The Council initially assumed that faculty and staff findings and recommendations would be made under the same umbrella of the Administrative Structures and Policies Working Group (ASPWG). However, as the working groups moved forward, it became evident that there was significant overlap among the three groups with respect to faculty issues. For purposes of clarity, the following section on faculty incorporates input from all three working groups. Tufts University aims to create a diverse faculty, appropriately reflective of its student body and society at large. Compositional diversity remains an essential foundation for a more inclusive university. At the same time, the university recognizes that compositional diversity is not enough to ensure that the university provides a supportive and welcoming educational environment for a diverse cohort of students. The specific actions of faculty, and the tone they set in the classroom and laboratory, are enormously important in the student experience at both the undergraduate and graduate/professional level. It should be noted that in cases where recruitment and hiring are being referenced, diversity is defined on the basis of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) categories of national origin found in the university's Affirmative Action Plan (AAP), and not on the definition of diversity employed by the Council. The university uses the AAP to ensure compliance with Affirmative Action as a matter of federal law in the United States. Thus, \"diversity,\" as well as racial identities and categories of national origin, meet definitions prescribed by Federal Law and the US Census Bureau, and do not necessarily reflect terms or groupings that Tufts might otherwise prefer to use. Employees are not required to disclose their racial identity; therefore the university is limited in terms of the completeness of data collection and data referenced using the term Person of Color (POC) or Faculty of Color (FOC). All those who identify as \"non-White\" in race categories are referred to as \"People of Color\" (staff or staff and faculty members) or \"Faculty of Color.\" However, Tufts uses the data as a point of reference especially when comparing the composition of candidates and staff against the census data and labor availability data provided by institutions such as the US Department of Labor. (See >> Appendix G for more detailed discussion.) Findings and Recommendations Recruitment and Retention It has been shown that proactive efforts in recruitment and retention can have a significant impact on the university's racial, ethnic, and gender composition. Existing data and benchmarks can be used to identify areas where progress has been made. If Tufts is to advance its diversity agenda it will need to have a diverse faculty. We cannot expect Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 30 FACULTYstudents to feel comfortable and at home if they do not find their own identities reflected in the composition of the faculty. FINDINGS \u00b7As an Affirmative Action employer, Tufts is required by law to file a yearly Affirmative Action Plan (AAP). The AAP is based on US census data, updated every 10 years. The most recent available census was done in 2010 and serves as the basis for the 2013- 2014 AAP. Census data do not take into account issues such as location, desirability of employer, or competition for talent within specific marketplaces. The AAP does, however, provide a benchmark for comparison with similarly situated peer institutions and provides milestones for tracking and measuring our efforts in areas such as candidate pool diversity, and diversity of Tufts' em - ployee population versus the census data (which indicate broader labor availability). The AAP provides detailed information on the availability of labor for specific categories of positions based on census data, internal movement (promotions, transfers, and turnover rates), and areas of possible adverse impact relative to hiring and promotion rates. \u00b7The AAP is required to include faculty; while the AAP is regionally based, however, faculty recruitment often reflects a nationally competitive market of outstanding candidates, with significant variations across the potential applicant pool and various disciplines. \u00b7Across the university, the majority of full-time faculty members (all professor ranks, instruc - tors, and lecturers) identify as White, and only slight increases have been achieved since 2009. Less than 20% identify themselves as FOC. Additionally, faculty members have reported they are hesitant to identify themselves as diverse across other categories such as LGBT, which compounds the university's ability and comprehend the broader implications of diversity when faculty members are unwilling or not supported to acknowledge their own diversity. \u00b7Examination of the demographic profile of current the Tufts faculty suggests improvement is needed before we achieve diversity at the faculty level that is reflective of the student body and community served (see >> Appendix J ). Each school faces specific and unique challeng - es in attracting faculty members, which may include a lack of pipeline, decrease in students entering certain fields such as those in the STEM areas, and declines in NIH funding. \u00b7There is considerable variation in faculty diversity across Tufts' various Schools. The A&S full-time faculty, for example, is comprised of 23% FOC and 43.4% women. The FOC per - centages remain stable when part-time faculty members are included. However, women represent fully 62% of the part-time faculty.21 The Fletcher School, on the other hand em - ploys less than 15% FOC (n=59). Women comprise only 27% of Fletcher's full-time and less than 1% of those are FOC.22 \u00b7For many years faculty search procedures have included oversight by the deans and resources to help departments build a diverse pool of applicants. Over the last five years deans have taken an even more active role in encouraging diversity and enforcing consis - tent quality standards through the closer monitoring of statistics, framing of job advertise - ments, outreach mechanisms, and meetings with search committees to agree on search strategies that will increase the diversity of the pool. Despite concerted efforts, more work still needs to be done. \u00b7In the School of Arts and Sciences (A&S), the faculty recruitment process is centralized and monitored by the Associate Dean of Faculty Affairs for A&S&E. Although there are Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 31 FACULTYno formal hiring goals in place, the monitoring of recruiting and hiring activity has led to a 200% increase in the number of diverse faculty hires from 2010 to 2012. Schools without a formal and centralized faculty recruitment process have less success in hiring a diverse faculty. \u00b7Some recent examples of effective recruitment efforts leading to increased diversity among the candidate pool include the search for the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the Chair of the Periodontics Department at the dental school. In both searches the interview committee was asked to present at least three candidates to the Dean with at least one candidate being a POC and/or a female. Both search committees utilized both formal and informal sourcing channels, including posting the position description in academic journals, on the Tufts Alumni website, and to the membership of professional organizations. Each committee identified and interviewed between 10 and 13 candidates, whose compositional makeup was approximately 30% diverse across racial and gender lines. In both cases the resulting hires were racially diverse and in the case of the chair of Periodontics, an African American female was hired. \u00b7The work of the Task Force on Work-Life Balance in the Schools of Arts and Sciences and Engineering has highlighted the importance of issues of work-life balance to successful faculty careers. Such issues are often especially salient for women faculty. RECOMMENDATION Increase the diversity of the faculty to be more representative of increasing diversity in the student population. \u00b7In addition to institutional support and oversight, local governance is critical to achiev - ing success in faculty recruitment. Each school should commit to assigning a senior designee, reporting directly to a dean, to develop an action plan to monitor faculty hiring processes to ensure attention to diversity goals. \u00b7Each school should develop explicit and quantifiable goals for faculty composition, to be reviewed regularly. Deans and department chairs should be expected to achieve these goals, just as deans are currently accountable for meeting their critical benchmarks of success. The relevant demographic benchmarks need to be determined at least nation - ally, if not internationally. \u00b7Schools need to develop more competitive and compelling recruitment strategies that encourage and support diverse faculty to join the university, including initiatives to promote work-life balance. \u00b7The university should explore opportunities to strengthen informal mentoring and build community for faculty from diverse backgrounds by building on existing affinity-group models. Involvement in Student Recruitment Faculty members often serve as mentors, particularly in the graduate and professional schools' pipeline and enrichment programs. As such, they are involved in student recruitment via these programs, and commonly as a service to the community.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 32 FACULTYFINDINGS \u00b7As noted with respect to the graduate and professional student experience, Tufts is a member of The Leadership Alliance, a successful pipeline model that systematically men - tors talented, underrepresented, and underserved individuals at all stages of the higher education pipeline into positions in academia, the public, and private sectors, offering support at each step of the academic pathway. The Summer Research Early Identification Programs offered under its auspices at Tufts offer undergraduates the opportunity to work under the guidance of a faculty mentor to gain knowledge and training in research. \u00b7The work of the Leadership Alliance has shown the potential of pipeline programs featuring faculty mentorship to make significant con \u00b7tributions to the development of a competitive and diverse workforce. RECOMMENDATION Recognize and reward faculty who participate in student recruitment activities that enhance diversity. \u00b7Faculty members who serve as mentors in such pipeline and enrichment programs should receive recognition and reward as serving in important ways to Tufts to fulfill its mission of expanding access to education, increasing diversity, and contributing to the community. Mentoring and Professional Development As mentioned in the Undergraduate Student Experience section, student interactions with faculty members are one area in which the challenges of full inclusion are evident. Students report experiences that include microaggressions in the classroom, unequal opportunities to participate in research, and varying overall comfort levels with faculty members. Tufts must train its faculty to model the values of the university to our community in order to build stronger mentoring relationships with all students. The Tufts mission statement adopted in 1994 articulates a commitment to diversity as well as academic excellence and active citizenship, but inclusion has not often been seen as a core commitment for faculty. The 2010 HERI Faculty Survey noted that there was a need for Tufts to do more to support a culture of flexibility, diversity; the survey responses in some cases noted the need specifically to create programs that would foster a more inclusive and forward-looking work environment. FINDINGS \u00b7The working group on the Undergraduate Student Experience found that focus group data from multiple Tufts sources point to classroom-based problems with addressing or sup - porting diversity; insufficient training of faculty members to promote effective pre-major advising and overall mentoring; insufficient knowledge/appreciation of power dynamics between faculty members and students; and students feeling silenced, inside and beyond the classroom, by racist/sexist comments or other forms of discriminatory behavior. See also Findings and Recommendations: Undergraduate Student Experience (page 11).Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 33 FACULTY \u00b7In the climate survey administered to graduate and professional students, mentoring was addressed separately from formal academic advising to obtain a more complete picture on where and how students seek guidance. The survey instrument defined a mentor as \"a more senior person within student's training environment with a sustained on-going relationship with the student. A mentor promotes professional development by discussing the student's goals, needs, weaknesses and accomplishments.\" The survey results (>> Appendix I ) show that the number of students with a mentor ranges from roughly 45% to 60%, depending on the student group being considered, which suggests that there is room for improvement. \u00b7Tufts currently offers professional development and training in the areas of mentoring, cultural competency, managing diversity, and promoting inclusion on an ad hoc basis. This training is often provided on a remedial or corrective basis when issues of discrimination or harassment have surfaced among staff, faculty members, and/or students. We have an opportunity to be more proactive. \u00b7A number of current groups and committees offer models for effective efforts to promote diversity and inclusion, including: \u00b7Informal affinity groups such as the LGBT Caucus on the Medford/Somerville campus comprised of a broad cross section of staff and faculty members. \u00b7Standing Faculty Committees such as the faculty/staff/student Equal Educational Opportunity Committee in AS&E, which addresses issues of diversity, climate, and inclusion; in 2011, the Committee issued an important report with recommendations for action within AS&E. Other AS&E examples include the Committee on Student Life, Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid Committee, and Budget and Priorities Committee. \u00b7Ad hoc committees such as the AS&E Diversity Council, which brings together adminis - trators whose work addresses issues of diversity and inclusion. \u00b7Information-sharing groups such as the AS&E Feedback Group, which is comprised of non-exempt staff and could serve as a model for other groups that promote communica - tion, information sharing, and connection between faculty members, staff, and students. \u00b7In forums sponsored by the Council's working group on the Undergraduate Student Experience, undergraduate students have indicated that many faculty members and staff do not necessarily possess the skills needed to engage effectively with the issues of diversity and identity raised by the university's current student body. \u00b7Although Tufts has a Working with One Another policy, no set of formal standards exists for fostering and enhancing diversity, including how to increase productivity and promote a sense of community. \u00b7Currently, there are no regular requirements or incentives for faculty to participate in trainings related to diversity unless they are for \"remedial/corrective\" purposes. \u00b7Tufts School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) has incorporated a new cultural competency curriculum that focuses on cultural competence as a core skill to be taught to students, staff, and faculty members as part of the dental education experience.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 34 FACULTY \u00b7The Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT) offers training for faculty members. The Provost's Office coordinates the Academic Leadership Development (ALD) program that provides faculty leaders (e.g., academic deans, department chairs, program directors, etc.) with the tools and skills necessary to navigate the myriad issues that arise with leadership roles, a need identified by the university-wide Committee on Teaching and Faculty Development and Human Resources Department. \u00b7A best practice to ensure the success and sustainability of diversity and inclusion efforts is to link these efforts clearly to performance and professional development and advance - ment, including tenure and promotion. \u00b7Tufts has in place a variety of existing internal recognition mechanisms, ranging from the university-wide Tufts Distinction Awards to faculty awards in the various Schools such as the Multicultural Service Award presented by the Equal Educational Opportunity Committee in AS&E. RECOMMENDATION Increase the awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclusion in faculty through professional development programs and the creation of communities of practice and learning. \u00b7Tufts should increase the awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclusion in faculty through professional development activities that instill an under - standing in the faculty as to how inclusion and equity, or the lack thereof, impact the lives of students in terms of campus climate, the classroom dynamic, the curriculum, and co-curricular activities. \u00b7The university should assess the feasibility of developing mechanisms to recognize and reward faculty who devoted significant effort to advancing diversity and inclusion, particularly through student mentorship, pedagogy, and pipeline programming. \u00b7The transition of new faculty members to Tufts should include an inclusive orientation program and specific training with respect to issues of diversity and climate. Additional appropriate professional development should be provided when faculty members are promoted or given new major leadership roles. \u00b7The university should standardize a protocol for tracking faculty activities related to diversity and inclusion efforts, linking them to tenure and promotion criteria. \u00b7Develop and foster the sharing of best practices and experiences by forming communi - ties of learning and practices on these topics. These practices can then be woven into faculty meetings and trainings. \u00b7Create more linkages to current training opportunities being offered by CELT and within specific areas that have more evolved content and resources related to diversity and inclusion. \u00b7Incorporate training with respect to issues of diversity and inclusion as core require - ments for all management and leadership programs.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 35 FACULTYInfusing Diversity in the Curriculum The working group on the Undergraduate Student Experience concluded that the curriculum must serve as a key focal point for any plan that addresses diversity in our academic community. We must create venues and mechanisms for faculty members and departments to explore and exchange ideas and experiences regarding different aspects of diversity and how these affect the curriculum, the classroom, and campus life. FINDINGS \u00b7In response to the COFHE 2012 Senior Survey, Tufts' graduating seniors, and especially males, report lower levels than their peers elsewhere of understanding of social problems, ability to identify moral and ethical issues, and development of global awareness.23 See also Findings and Recommendations: Undergraduate Student Experience (page 11). \u00b7At the Diversity Luncheon held for graduating seniors in May 2012 and attended by approximately 100 students, the curriculum emerged as a topic. While over 20% of participants identified a curricular experience focused in some way on social justice as one that had been a positive in their experience of diversity while at Tufts, close to one- quarter felt the need for some formalized way to address diversity in the curriculum.24 This dovetails with one of the key points made in the T10 Strategic Plan: that, \"We consider cultural competency, fluent interactions with different people and perspectives, to be an essential component of higher education in the 21st century. In terms of basic preparation, personal experience with navigating issues of diversity, and exposure to different cul - tures and contexts, are increasingly important for all students. . . .\" See also Findings and Recommendations: Undergraduate Student Experience (page 11). RECOMMENDATION Review the curriculum in the context of diversity, inclusion, and social justice. \u00b7Rather than add a diversity requirement into the undergraduate curriculum that would ultimately reduce the issue to one item on a checklist of preexisting courses, the working group instead recommends a multipronged and multidisciplinary approach to supporting a common curricular experience during the first year through the integration of issues of diversity, inclusion, and social justice into a variety of coursework, includ - ing proactive discussions about how diversity relates to students and how they relate to diversity locally, nationally, and globally. See also Findings and Recommendations: Undergraduate Student Experience (page 11). \u00b7When students leave Tufts they should take part in an evaluation process in which they self-assess their learning and evaluate the educational processes. This should include specific elements of our diversity practice. The evaluation process should allow us to learn which elements of our practice succeed in providing the educational experiences we desire and which need to be replaced or improved. The evaluation process should allow student responses to be aggregated within schools and individual responses made anonymous to the faculty.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 36 STAFFStaff Context Tufts aims to create a diverse staff, appropriately reflective of its student body and society at large. Compositional diversity remains an essential foundation for a more inclusive university. At the same time, the university has long recognized that compositional diversity alone will not ensure that staff find Tufts a welcoming institution or ensure that they support most effectively the work of a diverse student body and faculty. As in the previous section regarding faculty, where staff recruitment and hiring are being referenced, diversity is defined on the basis of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) categories of national origin found in the university's Affirmative Action Plan (AAP), and not on the definition of diversity adopted by the Council. The university uses the AAP to ensure compliance with Affirmative Action as a matter of federal law in the United States. Thus, \"diversity,\" as well as racial identities and categories of national origin meet definitions prescribed by Federal Law and the US Census Bureau, and do not necessarily reflect terms or groupings that Tufts might otherwise prefer to use. Employees are not required to disclose their racial identity; therefore the university is limited in terms of the completeness of data collection and data referenced using the term Person of Color (POC) or Faculty of Color (FOC). Those who identify as \"non-White\" in race categories are referred to as \"People of Color\" (staff or staff and faculty) or \"Faculty of Color.\" However, Tufts uses the data as a point of reference especially when comparing the composition of candidates and staff against the census data and labor availability data provided by institutions such as the US Department of Labor. (See >> Appendix G for more detailed discussion.) Findings and Recommendations Recruitment, Hiring, and Promotion Proactive efforts in recruitment and retention have been shown to have significant impact on the university's racial, ethnic, and gender composition. Tufts has opportunities to use existing data and benchmarks to identify areas where progress has been notably successful. As an affirmative action employer, Tufts is required by law to file a yearly Affirmative Action Plan (AAP). The AAP is based on US census data, updated every 10 years. The most recent available census was done in 2010 and serves as the basis for the 2013- 2014 AAP . Census data do not take into account issues such as location, desirability of employer, or competition for talent within specific marketplaces. The AAP does, however, provide a benchmark for comparison with similarly situated peer institutions and provides milestones for tracking and measuring our efforts in areas such as the diversity of our candidate pool and our employee population versus the census data, which indicate broader labor availability. The AAP provides detailed information on the availability of labor for specific categories of positions based on census data, internal movement (promotions, transfers, and turnover rates), and areas of possible adverse impact relative to hiring and promotion rates.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 37 STAFFFINDINGS \u00b7There is considerable variation in the demographics of the staff population across Tufts' three Massachusetts campuses. \u00b7The Medford/Somerville campus staff population is comprised of 6% People of Color (POC), yet the surrounding labor market, as noted in the 2011- 2012 AAP , is comprised of over 13% POC.25 \u00b7The Boston campus employs 29% POC and approximately 60% White females. \u00b7The Grafton campus staff population is comprised of 9% POC; limited public transportation inhibits candidates from outside the immediate area from applying if they do not have their own transportation. \u00b7The AAP and other reports have been readily available for review, but they do not appear to be used in hiring or management decisions or as metrics for assessment of hiring man - agers throughout the institution. The university does not have a policy governing their use for such purposes, nor have they been widely distributed or utilized. Thus, Tufts is missing an opportunity to use the AAP in setting goals and metrics for hiring and promotion rates for specific job categories. \u00b7Affirmative Action Officers (AAOs) were originally intended to be school-level designees who would educate and monitor recruiting activity, ensuring efforts were made to bal - ance processes and identify and interview diverse pools of candidates. The AAOs were supposed to monitor the recruitment of all staff (though not faculty) positions. Since there is no requirement that AAOs be directly involved in the recruitment and hiring processes, they are generally only asked to approve a hire at the end of the hiring process \u2014 long past the moment for effective oversight or possible intervention. Furthermore, given the lack of data collection and analysis in regards to hiring practices, there have been few available metrics that might have facilitated stronger, more effective oversight of hiring practices even if AAOs had been more involved. Thus having AAOs in place without the proper access to information and metrics has not been effective and has given the illusion that the university is monitoring and addressing issues of lack of diversity in the recruit - ment process, when that is in fact not the case.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 38 STAFFRECOMMENDATION Develop recruitment pipelines and new strategies for outreach and retention to address systemic underrepresentation of specific groups within the staff. \u00b7In addition to institutional support and oversight, local governance is critical to achiev - ing success in recruitment. Each school should commit to assigning a senior designee, reporting directly to a dean, to develop an action plan to monitor diversity hiring pro - cesses within the school. \u00b7We should coordinate efforts to build bench strength across the university by identify - ing and cultivating promising candidates, both internal and external, prior to openings. \u00b7Human Resources needs to ensure that hiring managers are educated in effective inter - viewing. The relevant training and orientation must include cultural and diversity com - ponents geared to ensuring that hiring managers are equipped to conduct interviews with minimal bias. Additionally, Human Resources needs to monitor and proactively address lack of diversity in candidate pools in partnership with the hiring department. \u00b7Develop internal \"mobility\" metrics that monitor and track not only retention but also internal mobility, including transfers and promotions. \u00b7Develop an instructional approach to talent management and succession planning. Identify and monitor compositional diversity within \"feeder\" positions that lead to management positions. \u00b7Continue to explore opportunities to promote work-life balance that have the potential to strengthen the attractiveness of Tufts as an employer to diverse staff. Campus Climate The Tufts vision statement adopted in 1994 articulated a commitment to diversity as well as academic excellence and active citizenship, but intentional efforts to develop a climate of inclusion for staff have been limited. The 2011- 2012 At-Work Employee Survey noted that there was a need for Tufts to do more to support a culture of flexibility and diversity; in some cases, the survey responses noted the need specifically to create programs that would foster a more inclusive and forward-looking work environment. FINDINGS \u00b7The following themes emerged from open focus group discussions organized by the Council's working group on Administrative Structures and Policies: \u00b7The \"Tufts culture\" is undefined. \u00b7There is little sense of community among staff, who are not part of the faculty community. \u00b7There are silos that segment staff, students, and faculty members. \u00b7The university's definition of diversity should go beyond demographics and address social and behavioral issues of social justice and inclusion, particularly among staff who work in student affairs and services divisions.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 39 STAFF \u00b7Previous efforts to advance diversity and inclusion at Tufts were seen as unsuccessful in part because of inadequate transparency and a lack of communication regarding prog - ress and efforts. Without a reporting mechanism, some people assumed no progress was being made. \u00b7A number of current groups and committees offer models for effective efforts to promote diversity and inclusion for members of the staff community, including: \u00b7Informal affinity groups such as the LGBT Caucus on the Medford/Somerville campus comprised of a broad cross section of staff and faculty members. \u00b7Information-sharing groups such as the AS&E Feedback Group, which is comprised of non-exempt staff and could serve as a model for other groups that promote communica - tion, information sharing, and connection between faculty members, staff, and students. \u00b7Additional models exist for effective staff participation in efforts to advance diversity and inclusion within the university community more broadly: \u00b7Standing Faculty Committees such as the faculty/staff/student Equal Educational Opportunity Committee in AS&E, which addresses issues of diversity, climate, and inclusion; in 2011, the Committee issued an important report with recommendations for action within AS&E. Other AS&E examples include the Committee on Student Life, Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid Committee, and Budget and Priorities Committee. \u00b7Ad hoc committees such as the AS&E Diversity Council, which brings together adminis - trators whose work addresses issues of diversity and inclusion. \u00b7Undergraduate students have indicated in forums sponsored by the Undergraduate Student Experience Working Group of the Diversity Council that staff as well as faculty sometimes do not possess the skills needed to engage effectively with the issues of diver - sity and identity raised by the university's current student body. RECOMMENDATION Articulate the meaning of diversity and include it as a core value in Tufts' mission and vision. \u00b7Identify structural models that enhance and promote diversity and inclusion, including affinity groups and communities of learning. \u00b7We should continue efforts to better understand and define what \"diversity\" means to the Tufts community. A clearer definition of what is meant by \"diversity\" better positions Tufts to foster diversity by taking stock of what defines its culture, and what language, values, standards of conduct, and expectations can be shared across the institution. \u00b7We must continue to examine the place of diversity and inclusion in central and local mission, vision, and values statements to provide a basis for proactive efforts to put our values into practice. \u00b7We should seek to create an environment at Tufts where being inclusive in both one's thinking and approach is valued, important, and rewarded.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 40 STAFFProfessional Development and Training Tufts currently offers professional development and training in the areas of mentoring, cultural competency, managing diversity, and promoting inclusion primarily on an ad hoc basis. Often these trainings are done on a \"remedial/corrective basis\" when issues of discrimination or harassment have surfaced. We have an opportunity to be more proactive. FINDINGS \u00b7Although Tufts has a written Working with One Another policy, there is no set of formal standards for fostering and enhancing diversity, including how to increase productivity and promote a sense of community. \u00b7Currently, there is no requirement or incentive to take diversity-related trainings unless they are being implemented for remedial or corrective purposes. \u00b7The School of Dental Medicine has incorporated a new cultural competency curriculum that focuses on cultural competence as a core skill to be taught to students, staff, and faculty members as part of the dental education experience. \u00b7The GPWG identified that a best practice to ensure the success and sustainability of diversity and inclusion efforts is to clearly link these efforts to performance, professional development, and advancement. Staff promotion requires completion of a compensation review form. The form could be modified to request evidence of the employee's commit - ment to diversity and inclusion as an essential criterion for potential promotion. \u00b7Tufts has in place internal recognition programs, such as the Tufts Distinction Awards, that can provide an opportunity to honor and celebrate contributions to diversity and inclusive excellence. RECOMMENDATION Increase staff competency in diversity and inclusion issues through training and professional development. \u00b7Increase the visibility through systematic and proactive communication of the Working with One Another policy, which establishes uniform guidelines to promote a work and educational environment that fosters respect and inclusion. \u00b7Expand existing performance incentives and award programs, and develop ones as appropriate, in order to recognize outstanding, innovative, and transformative initiatives advancing diversity and inclusion, including mentorship. \u00b7Ensure that hiring managers and search committees are trained for new diversity and inclusion hiring practices and workplace policies.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 41 Concluding Remarks and Next Steps The Council is grateful to everyone who has contributed to its work and looks forward to an ongoing community conversation concerning diversity and inclusion at Tufts. Given the research, discourse, and hard work that has led to the development of these recommendations, Tufts is now poised better than ever before to fulfill the promise of its fundamental aspirations regarding issues of diversity and inclusion. The past year and a half has been deeply informative: we are now equipped with the knowledge to match our conviction that the furthest and highest reaches of a university's excellence in the pursuit of knowledge can only be made possible by an actionable commitment to embracing and nurturing a communal sense of the reality and importance of diversity and inclusion. In the coming years Tufts stands to augment its natural resources and capacities for fostering a healthy and productive university community that finds strength in its diversity, and that possesses the concrete tools to translate this vision into a reality. Continuing to advance diversity and inclusion at Tufts will depend on the sustained involvement of contributors from across the university, and so it is the Council's sincere hope that this report may serve not only as an advisory document for the central administration, schools, and divisions, but also as a call to action for the entire community to remain engaged in the important ongoing work of making Tufts the best that it possibly can be. For the goal of full and equal empowerment that is at the root of our institutional commitment to diversity and inclusion, there is also a shared sense of responsibility, so let this report stand as a first step in that collective work, that it may enable us to proceed further than ever before.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 42 APPENDICESAppendix A : Council on Diversity Information Scope of Work Tufts University has a long history of commitment to diversity and inclusion. As the university vision statement adopted by the Board of Trustees in 1994 says, \"We value a diverse community of women and men of different races, religions, geographic origins, socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual orientations, personal characteristics, and interests \u2014 where differences are understood and respected.\" While we can be proud of significant accomplishment in meeting this commitment, we also know that there is more to be done. We believe it is important to renew our institutional commitment, review our accomplishments to date, and define specific goals to create at Tufts a more fully diverse and effectively inclusive academic community, which will advance excellence in teaching and research and strengthen the university's positive impact on society. The Council on Diversity at Tufts will focus on advancing diversity and inclusion through our administrative structures and policies and in the experiences of our undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. This will require concerted attention to how the university can best recruit and retain a truly diverse community of students, faculty members, and staff, in light of the importance of critical mass as well as inclusive attitudes; how it can support their academic and professional success; how it can teach skills and encourage attitudes that support effective interactions with diverse communities inside and outside the university; and how it sets expectations for members of the Tufts community. The Council will take a broad view of the possible dimensions of diversity under consideration. Depending on the specific topics at issue, they may include but not be limited to race and ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, physical ability, religion, geographic origin and language background, or socioeconomic status. Guiding Questions The Council will develop strategic recommendations with respect to central questions including the following: Administrative Structures and Policies \u00b7What role should diversity play in a future revision of the university's formal mission statement? \u00b7How can attention to diversity and inclusion and the work of this Council be most effectively integrated into university-wide strategic planning? \u00b7What would be the optimal balance and relationship, in a decentralized academic environment, between central administrative support for diversity initiatives, and school and divisional offices and programs?Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 43 APPENDICES \u00b7How can the university most effectively strengthen its recruitment, retention, and professional advancement of a diverse community of faculty and staff? \u00b7How can the university foster in its faculty and staff the multicultural competence needed to teach and work effectively in a diverse academic community and as representatives of Tufts in diverse local, national, and global communities outside the university? \u00b7How can the university foster accountability among faculty and staff for advancing its commitment to diversity and inclusion? Undergraduate Student Experience \u00b7How can the university most effectively strengthen the recruitment, retention, and aca - demic success of a diverse community of undergraduates? \u00b7How can the university ensure that all its undergraduates have equal access to the full array of educational and co-curricular opportunities available to Tufts students? \u00b7How can the university best support undergraduates' multiple personal identities in the context of a diverse residential academic community? \u00b7How can the university foster in its undergraduates the multicultural competence needed to interact successfully with peers, faculty, and staff in a diverse academic community? \u00b7How can the university prepare its undergraduates with the skills and resources to engage effectively with diverse local, national, and global communities outside the university during their time as students? \u00b7How can the university foster in its undergraduates, from the time they join the Tufts community, the skills they will need to be effective and engaged participants in diverse communities throughout their lives? Graduate and Professional Student Experience \u00b7How can the university most effectively strengthen the recruitment, retention, and academic success of a diverse community of graduate and professional students? \u00b7How can the university foster in its graduate and professional students the multicultural competence needed to interact successfully with peers, faculty, and staff in diverse aca - demic and professional sectors? \u00b7How can the university prepare its graduate and professional students with the skills and resources to engage effectively with diverse local, national, and global communities outside the university during their time as students? \u00b7How can the university foster in its graduate and professional students, from the time they join the Tufts community, the skills they will need to be effective and engaged scholars, practitioners, and professionals in diverse communities throughout their lives? \u00b7What opportunities does the university have to help address systemic pipeline issues in graduate and professional education, acting alone or in concert with other institutions? To assist in formulating its recommendations, the Council established working groups \u2014 on administrative structures and policies, the undergraduate student experience, and the graduate and professional student experience \u2014 to propose draft recommendations to the Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 44 APPENDICESfull Council for consideration. These working groups included additional members of the university community \u2014 faculty members, students, and staff \u2014 who brought additional perspectives and expertise to bear in the development of specific recommendations. The Council and working groups reviewed past assessments and recommendations regarding diversity and inclusion at Tufts, progress to date, current programmatic activity, and relevant comparative experience and examples. The Council's recommendations were informed by an awareness of current and anticipated academic initiatives at Tufts relevant to diversity and inclusion, which are proceeding under the direction of the faculty. The Council solicited community input on draft recommendations before presenting its final recommendations. Council Working Process President Monaco publicly launched the Council in March 2012. The Council was chaired by the President, with Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences Joanne Berger-Sweeney as Vice Chair, and its membership included students, faculty members, and staff as well as two members of the Board of Trustees. To assist in formulating its recommendations, the Council established three working groups, which were asked to propose specific recommendations to the full Council for consideration. The working groups were focused on: \u00b7Administrative structures and policies; \u00b7The undergraduate student experience; and \u00b7The graduate and professional student experience. The working groups included additional members of the university community who have brought additional perspectives and expertise to bear in the development of the recommendations. The Undergraduate Student Experience Working Group held at least nine focus groups with stakeholders from across the university concerning the undergraduate experience, including undergraduate students in AS&E; graduating seniors; the Academic Resource Center; Health and Wellness Services; offices of Career Services, Alumni Relations, Campus Life, Greek Life, Admissions, and Financial Aid; Associate Deans of Undergraduate Education; the Chaplaincy and Hillel; Alumni leaders; and the AS&E Diversity Council. These focus groups covered relevant issues including but not limited to: creating dialogue between diverse groups; invisibility of particular underrepresented groups; difficulties with integration of international students; inter-religious life and relations with secular life on campus; socioeconomic barriers of entry to certain social, academic, and co-curricular activities; disability and handicap accessibility; cost of living; academic and curricular diversity consciousness and resource allocations; global versus domestic diversity; sexual violence; pre-professional training for diversity-relevant skill sets; counseling, mentorship, and advising issues; engagement and leadership of alumni from diverse groups; use of career services by different groups; admissions decisions and financial aid; and pipeline programs and recruitment.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 45 APPENDICESThe Administrative Structures and Policies Working Group conducted several focus groups, reaching over 200 faculty members and staff on the Medford/Somerville, Boston, and Grafton campuses, with the goal of gathering qualitative data and establishing themes among faculty members and staff from across the university. Those who attended were asked questions about: a Chief Diversity Officer; best practices with regard to diversity; needs regarding mentoring, professional development, diversity awareness, and climate; training to support and promote cultural competence; community-building across diverse groups; barriers to entry in various fields/departments; administrative transparency and accountability; work-life balance; racial diversity in leadership; data collection; human resources policies/procedures, including recruitment and retention; different models of university-wide diversity administration and incentive structures; communicating support of diversity as part of Tufts' values and mission; opportunities for diversity-related enrichment programs across the institution; and the climate survey. The working group reviewed the historical compositional diversity of Tufts' faculty and staff and results of surveys regarding their experiences and needs, such as the Excellence at Work staff project and the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) Faculty Survey. The Graduate and Professional Student Experience Working Group assessed results of focus groups and a university-wide diversity and inclusion climate survey, as well as recruitment, admissions, and academic progress data. Its recommendations are built on those results, and address recruitment, retention, and academic success; financing education; mentoring; the impact of faculty diversity and cultural competence; research and curriculum connections; and skills for success in a diverse workplace. The Council and working groups reviewed past assessments and recommendations regarding diversity and inclusion at Tufts, progress to date, current programmatic activity, and relevant comparative experience and examples. The Council is particularly grateful to the Office of Institutional Research and Evaluation for its invaluable support. The Council and working groups also reached out to students, faculty members, and staff for input through a variety of forums. In December 2012, the Council submitted a progress report on its work to the T10 Core Committees. In April 2013, it released for community comment a progress report and preliminary recommendations in regards to the Undergraduate Student Experience, while continuing to conduct qualitative and quantitative research, identify best practices within and outside Tufts, and develop preliminary recommendations for community comment.

Crucial administrative support has been provided by current staff including Candace Copithorne, Ariella Esther Green, and Jennifer Cisneros, as well as former staff McCall Allen, Lauren Kinderknecht, and Kara Storti. Lara Quiroga made critical contributions during her time in the Office of the President. Student interns Jacob Lipson A15, Benjamin Perlstein A13, Joseph B. Philipson A15, and Jonathan Steinberg A14 made important contributions. Mary Grace Duffy of Cambridge Hill Partners provided valuable counsel and facilitation as the Council began its work. Michael Baenen, Chief of Staff in the Office of the President, has masterfully coordinated Council activities. Especially important has been the tireless work of the staff of the Office of Institutional Research and Evaluation under the leadership of Dawn Terkla. Their commitment to this effort, at a time when the office was also coordinating Tufts' evaluation for continued institutional accreditation, has been exemplary.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 48 APPENDICESAppendix B : Proposed Chief Diversity Officer Reporting Structure Tufts University Board of Trustees Anthony Monaco President Senior Vice President of University Relations Vice President of Advancement Secretary of the Corporation Chief of Staff Executive Vice PresidentProvost, Senior Vice President Vice President of Operations Vice President of University Information Technology Vice President of Finance & Treasurer Vice President of Human Resources Dean, Th e Fletcher School of Law and DiplomacyDean, School of Engineering Dean, School of Arts & Sciences Dean, School of Dental Medicine Center Director, USDA Human Nutrition Research Center Interim Dean, Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy Dean , Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine Dean, School of Medicine Interim Dean, Tisch College of Citizenship & Public Service Vice Provost for Resear ch Associate Provost Associate Provost for Institutional Research & Assessment Assistant Provost for Administration and FinanceDean, Graduate School of Arts & Sciences Dean, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences Associate ProvostUniversity Counsel Associate Provost of Academic PlanningOpportunity Chief Diversity Officer (Exact Title TBD)Office of Equal Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 49 APPENDICESAppendix C : Undergraduate Student Experience Implementation Recommendations The work of the Council on Diversity and its working groups, in addition to developing overarching recommendations, identified more specific recommendations based on their findings for programmatic change and implementation. These recommendations need to be further analyzed and prioritized by the next iteration of the Council and under the purview of the Chief Diversity Officer and other faculty, staff, and administrators at the school and department level. Campus Climate, Community Values, and Communications RECOMMENDATION Create a climate that recognizes commonalities while understanding, engaging, and celebrating differences. \u00b7The UWG recommends that the university reframe the conversation from one of diversity to one of social justice. While diversity often focuses on composition and the marginalized members of a community with the aim of celebrating difference, social justice engages all members of a community in the consideration of the multiple identities we each have and how the intersections of these identities relate to power, privilege, and oppression both locally and globally. \u00b7Along with a shift toward social justice and inclusion, the university, through the CDO and an ongoing Diversity Council, must strive to further understand the issues faced by histor - ically underrepresented students and other members of our community who have ongoing experiences of bias and exclusion. \u00b7The university should develop a statement of Community Values that clearly communicates our expectations for all members of our community. \u00b7The university should establish an ongoing proactive and deliberative series of dialogues from the top down that affirm and communicate our values as an institution to both cur - rent and incoming members of our community. These should be designed to bring students, faculty, staff, alumni, and administrators together for community-building and dialogue on campus climate issues. \u00b7In regard to campus climate issues and bias incidents on campus, the response protocol must be transparent, timely, and reviewed annually for effectiveness. \u00b7The UWG recommends that data be gathered on existing curricular and co-curricular offices and programs within AS&E that address campus climate issues, identity devel - opment, social justice, and/or equity, inclusion, and bias \u2014 such as the Group of Six, the Social Justice Leadership Initiative (SJLI), and Intercultural and Social Identities Programs Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 50 APPENDICES(ISIP) \u2014 so that their strengths and weaknesses may be better assessed. This data can be used to develop benchmarks and best practices to support their work with the groups they focus on serving, as well as their work to foster greater cross-group interaction. Based on data and assessment, offices and programs that support historically marginalized students may benefit from resources to enhance the impact of their efforts.26 \u00b7With the arrival of the new Dean of Tisch College, members of the newly constituted Diversity Council should meet with administrators at Tisch College to review the college's definition and implementation of Active Citizenship. The university should strive to ensure that active citizenship and social justice are defined, articulated, and advanced in ways that support the university's values statement regarding Social Justice, and relevant programming of Tisch College should also be examined to ensure consistency of initiatives and working definitions. \u00b7Develop orientation/first- and second-year experience programming to include topics on intersectional and multiple-personal identities, social justice, and equity specific to campus climate issues. \u00b7Continue to offer the SJLI training workshops that teach cohorts of student leaders to define and analyze power, privilege, and oppression operating at various individual, insti - tutional, and cultural levels, as well as how to address and be peer leaders on issues of racism, homophobia, sexism, classism, and other social inequalities in their organizations and on campus. Currently SJLI training is mandatory for some peer leaders on campus but all student leaders should be incentivized to join SJLI training workshops. The program should be assessed and considered as a model for training all student leaders and opti - mized to enhance impact of efforts.27 \u00b7The university should support lectureships and forums on key topics/themes, with coordi - nated ongoing programming at all levels of the university. \u00b7Reconsider having staff or faculty advisors for student groups/clubs to engage faculty and staff, as well as mentor students around issues of inclusion and equity; develop and provide protocol for advisors around campus climate issues. \u00b7Response to the Senior Diversity Luncheons in May 2012 and 2013 was overwhelmingly positive. The UWG recommends the creation of semiannual dinners focused on particular cohorts of students, with faculty members, staff, and alumni, to discuss pertinent issues and with the goal of assessing climate in an ongoing manner. Curriculum for the 21st Century RECOMMENDATION Review the curriculum with focused attention to issues of diversity and inclusion to ensure it meets the needs of students in a changing world and educational community. \u00b7As the university moves forward in thinking about curricular review and reform, a peda - gogical focus on difference, inclusion, social justice, and global awareness must be a goal. Faculty members, departments, and programs should be incentivized and rewarded for shaping curriculum within their disciplines that also engage these issues. Feedback from Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 51 APPENDICESSeniors in 2013 included the recommendation that departments develop courses within the majors that address diversity and/or social justice as they pertain to the field. See also Faculty Implementation Recommendations (page 59). \u00b7The university should work to expand study abroad opportunities for students whose par - ticipation rates have been below the Tufts' average, including doing necessary outreach to families of first-generation, low-income, and historically underrepresented minority stu - dents to ensure that they understand the value of the study abroad experience. Additional aid should be made available to cover the \"hidden costs\" of the study abroad experience. \u00b7Study abroad as a mode of cross-cultural education could be better optimized with some additional resource allocation. For example, a half-credit course preparing and debriefing students would require relatively minimal outlay and would be value added. \u00b7Allowing, and even requiring, students to use an intellectual/academic framework to support and encourage their engagement with active citizenship, diversity, inclusion, and social justice would enrich their experiences and provide them with a foundation for a lifetime of contribution. For example, interested faculty and students could collaborate to develop mentored or supervised academic opportunities, outside of available courses, that create a scholarly framework for practice-based engagement with these issues. \u00b7The university should continue to gather data and monitor all gateway courses, especially those in the sciences, to ensure that study groups and peer mentoring are optimized. Faculty-Student Mentoring RECOMMENDATION Increase faculty and staff awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclusion through professional development programs. \u00b7Provide incentives and rewards for faculty members to develop and contribute to a curricu - lum including focus on inclusion, dialogue across differences, and attention to the differ - ential experiences of individuals and groups in terms of access to resources and in relation to power, privilege, and oppression (i.e., social justice); and to shape research agendas around pertinent issues. See also Faculty Implementation Recommendations (page 59). \u00b7Create and foster opportunities for faculty-student mentorship in academic fields and in co-curricular activities. In addition to a direct faculty-undergraduate student mentor model, a multilayered mentoring model could be fostered wherein faculty members mentor gradu - ate students who mentor undergraduate students. \u00b7Develop systems to ensure that opportunities are equitably distributed among our stu - dents by gathering and tracking data on mentoring and research opportunities. \u00b7Ensure that students are aware of the role course evaluations can play in documenting and providing feedback on classroom climate.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 52 APPENDICESAccess and Equity in Financial Aid RECOMMENDATION Increase and ensure access to resources that support all aspects of a Tufts education for a more diverse student population. \u00b7The university should develop a more robust program for seeking grant funding through the US Department of Education (e.g., TRIO programs such as McNair Scholars) and other such funding sources in order to increase our participation in programs that fund and support students from disadvantaged backgrounds in accessing academic research and other opportunities. \u00b7Pipeline programs such as BLAST and BEST are successfully improving college access and equity for first-generation and low-income students, but the costs are still significant and resources are limited. Building on the strategies in place to empower such disadvantaged students, the working group recommends the development of a more hands-on approach to help them manage their financial aid. \u00b7Beyond direct financial aid, students need further support to prevent the hidden costs of college (social and educational activities, supplies, study abroad, etc.) from inhibiting their access to a range of opportunities. All students should be encouraged and empowered to request specific funds for specific items (e.g., attending a conference). Offices, such as Study Abroad, should be supported in order to increase their ability to be proactive in di - recting students to, and helping them complete applications for, outside funding for foreign study. This would increase self-sufficiency for all students, while assisting first-generation and low-income students access the norms essential to academic and professional success. Co-Curricular Experience RECOMMENDATION Review the undergraduate co-curricular experience with focused attention to issues of diversity and inclusion. \u00b7In order to create a purposeful and unified experience for all undergraduates, the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate and Graduate Students should undertake an assessment and redesign of orientation and transition programming, and advising structures (both pre-major and major) to ensure that all students have access to resources for optimal academic achievement and an enriched experience within and beyond the community. \u00b7Student staff in the residences \u2014 Resident Assistants (RA) and Academic & Community Engagement Fellows (ACE)28 \u2014 should be trained and empowered to create communities that assist students with their transition to Tufts, increasing their awareness of campus and academic resources, and maximizing student learning. They should be knowledgeable on issues of social justice and building a diverse and inclusive community. Such training should be developed in conjunction with related programs and initiatives on campus, such as the Group of Six, Social Justice Leadership Initiative, and Peer-leader training, Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 53 APPENDICESto ensure we are utilizing all of our resources, that we are coordinating efforts, and that we are providing consistency in terms of our goals related to social justice education and leadership development. \u00b7Opportunities for meaningful participation in social activities should be enhanced by providing alternatives to and expanding the inclusiveness of both Greek Life and Athletics; this is especially critical to the first-year experience. Space limitations are currently one obstacle to creating a unified co-curricular experience. \u00b7Student organizations should be incentivized to collaborate in creating programming that reflects our Community Values. \u00b7In order to assure that students are aware of and have full access to the broad array of co-curricular opportunities organized on campus, the university should develop a more robust universal calendar. \u00b7Structures must be put in place to re-engage students returning from study abroad in the community, such as programs to train them as peer leaders and to optimize learning opportunities resulting from study abroad experience. Seniors must be similarly engaged so as to bring their time at Tufts to a fruitful conclusion, enable them to serve as campus leaders, and set them on the road to success as they leave the university community. \u00b7A program that creates mentoring relationships between graduate students and un - dergraduates could serve to promote undergraduates' ability to attain social capital, and help them learn to survive and thrive in academia. In recognition of the limited number of graduate programs at Tufts, the program could be cross-departmental and could serve to encourage undergraduates, especially those from historically marginal - ized groups, to consider a career in academia; it could also serve to foster the greater integration of graduate students into the community, while providing them professional development opportunities. \u00b7Establish a clearly defined mechanism/protocol to which faculty members, staff, and students can apply for funding activities that fall outside the normal cycles/channels; that fosters intersectional programming, community engagement, and that creates a link between curricular and co-curricular programming. Criteria for funding should be strength - ened to ensure that funds are used for programming that promotes social justice, equity, inclusion, and competency across differences.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 54 APPENDICESAppendix D : Graduate and Professional Student Experience Implementation Recommendations The work of the council on Diversity and its working groups, in addition to developing overarching recommendations, identified more specific recommendations based on their findings for programmatic and implementation. These recommendations need to be fur - ther analyzed and prioritized by the next iteration of the Council and under the purview of the Chief Diversity Officer and other faculty, staff, and administrators at the school and department level. Recruitment and Retention RECOMMENDATION Eliminate barriers to application and increase rates of matriculation. \u00b7Each program should aim to eliminate barriers in the application process. This may include providing application fee waivers, offering to cover the cost of travel for candidates of interest for whom traveling to Tufts may pose undue financial hardship, and providing assistance for candidates to identify organizations that may provide funds to defray costs associated with the application process. \u00b7Each program should explore online interviewing technology to help candidates for whom travel is a hardship. \u00b7Each school and graduate program should ensure it has an administrative structure in place to promote student retention, advancement, and support. As an example, the medical school's Office for Student Affairs has put in place a robust mechanism that ensures the early identification of students who may be at risk of failing. The Deans of Students meets with these students to discuss an academic plan. Students who may benefit from formal evaluation by a learning specialist are referred to the learning specialist for the Health Sciences campus. Students who fail more than two courses despite preemptive steps are referred to the Promotions Board. The outcome of deliberations by the Promotions Board may be a detailed plan of action that the student may be required to follow in order to rem - edy any underlining academic and/or psychological barriers to their academic success. \u00b7Effective mentoring has been identified as a key ingredient for the successful retention and graduation of students. Feedback from students at Tufts and elsewhere has consis - tently supported this strategy. Early assignment of graduate students to faculty mentors should be part of any retention strategy. \u00b7The GPWG also believes faculty assignments as mentors should be coupled with the provision of faculty orientation and development to ensure that all faculty mentors are aware of best practices and have the skills necessary to engage in the effective mentoring of students.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 55 APPENDICES \u00b7We need to utilize the resources of The Leadership Alliance more strategically. For example, the Leadership Alliance recently submitted a grant on behalf of the organization seeking to fund a new way to look at mentoring by incorporating more graduate student involvement. As a consortium member of The Leadership Alliance, Tufts has been named as a preferred partner should the grantor request a full submission. This is another way to involve and train graduate students to not only mentor, but also become more involved with traditionally underrepresented students who are doing summer research via the SR-EIP on both the Medford and Boston campuses. Student Pipeline Development RECOMMENDATION Capitalize on the preexisting excellent pipeline programs. \u00b7We recommend that Tufts expand its efforts to partner with area colleges and K-12 schools in the area with a shared vision of encouraging and supporting students to pursue post-graduate studies. This will serve to increase Tufts' visibility in, and civic engagement within, the community. \u00b7Faculty members who serve as mentors in these enrichment programs should receive recognition and reward for serving in important ways to fulfill Tufts' mission of expanding access to education, increasing diversity, and contributing to the community. \u00b7The Tufts University community should consider the establishment of awards in mentoring that seek to celebrate those faculty members who have consistently served as mentors in pipeline programs and contributed significantly to the successful development of students. Quality of the Educational Experience RECOMMENDATION Promote a diverse and inclusive learning community where students are supported to explore issues of diversity personally and learn from others. \u00b7Tufts teaching faculty should be strongly encouraged to take advantage of faculty devel - opment workshops that teach and promote skills and strategies for working with a diverse classroom. The Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching is a resource we would like to highlight in this regard. \u00b7Given the critical role of mentoring to the success of graduate and professional students, those who serve as mentors must receive faculty development and regular feedback to ensure consistent quality is maintained in all spheres of formal mentoring.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 56 APPENDICESStudent Support and Networks RECOMMENDATION Increase mentoring opportunities and review other student support services. \u00b7Structured mentoring programs, such as the one already in place at the dental school, may be an approach to increase the number of mentoring relationships. School- or program-based encouragement for students, faculty members, and staff to acquire or become mentors may be an additional strategy for increasing mentorship at Tufts. This could partly be achieved by making all students aware of networking events or mentoring programs. Encouraging students to become mentors would greatly enhance the graduate educational experience and professional development services, at the same time benefit - ing the mentees and establishing an important connection between high school, college, and graduate/professional school. \u00b7Mentoring programs could be connected to pipeline development programs, for example as in the Adventures in Veterinary Medicine program at the Cummings School, where anyone from a middle school student to an adult has the opportunity to interact with the school's faculty, staff, and students. Peer mentoring programs should be cognizant of the graduate students' degree requirement and expectations to prevent situations where graduate students become overwhelmed with additional responsibilities such as peer mentoring. Incoming students in each graduate and professional school should be matched based on their background and interests with more senior students. In this way, the incoming class has an additional resource to become oriented as students. This would also be an approach to encourage peer mentoring. Also, offering some type of recognition to the students who work as mentors would encourage junior students to enroll in the program and become mentors themselves. \u00b7Expand opportunities for interaction between students from different schools, and identify and implement alternative ways of student-to-student interactions to overcome geographical separation of the three campuses: Organize more events and initiatives that encourage inter-school interaction. The nature of these events may be social, such as the Provost's Diversity Reception, or professional, such as the Graduate Student Council (GSC) Research Symposium and the Graduate Institute For Teaching (GIFT) program. Such events have the potential of generating productive collaborations and improving the Tufts' climate. The physical distance between campuses provides a challenge to encour - aging socialization. This may be overcome through the implementation of web-based opportunities for interaction. \u00b7Develop strategies to disseminate information regarding student support services, especially through improved technological means such as online platforms and electronic information systems, and ensure that students are aware of the roles of student services and that it is clear that these resources are available at all times: Make already existing resources (for example, career development services or the GSC) widely known when available to all students at Tufts. Ensure that information is explicit when resources are school-specific and not available to students from other schools. There are several resources at Tufts that provide professional development and many support groups for students with diverse backgrounds, but students do not necessarily know their function.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 57 APPENDICES \u00b7Expand opportunities for interaction among students from different schools, and identify and implement alternative ways of achieving student-to-student interactions to overcome the geographical separation of the three campuses. \u00b7The limited awareness of different initiatives to unify the student body is an obstacle to promote a diverse and inclusive climate at Tufts. Many students are unaware of career development programs. The GSC Research Symposium is a powerful initiative to bring stu - dents together as it provides an opportunity for students from all campuses to share their work with each other. Many students outside the Medford/Somerville campus, however, are not aware of it and spaces to present are limited. Perhaps its capacity can be widened to include more students in the future. \u00b7Organize more social and cultural events that become known and easily accessible to all students and faculty members: Organizing university-wide social events is a good approach. Student councils from different schools are already involved in such initiatives and could benefit from additional support. The Provost's Diversity Reception is another example of a way to bring students of all backgrounds together, and more events like this one are needed. Sports events or community development programs could also unify the student body and enhance Tufts' climate, while at the same time giving back to the community. \u00b7Organize and promote professional events that are easily accessible to all students: Career development events may be another approach for students to bond, share experiences, and network. For example, a career day where students and Tufts alumni from different schools share their experiences with undergraduate students could be organized. This could additionally create opportunities for mentoring. During these career days, students and alumni may share their challenges in selecting and applying to graduate or profession - al school, as well as relevant information about their chosen professions.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 58 APPENDICESBeyond Graduation: Career Support and Advancement Services RECOMMENDATION Review career services across schools and offer a common core of services. \u00b7While there might be some benefit to unifying certain career data and services, given the unique needs of professional and graduate degree programs, there is a need for each school to offer tailored resources to its students. \u00b7We recommend that a career service center include a minimum menu of services to ensure that all graduate and professional students have equal access to the following services: \u00b7Negotiation skills training \u00b7Resume and cover letter coaching \u00b7Mock interviews \u00b7Job postings/databases for job searches \u00b7Work-life balance workshops \u00b7Use of technology in today's job market (e.g., employer info sessions, webinars) \u00b7Skills training \u00b7Alumni networking opportunities \u00b7Exposure to non-traditional tracks (e.g., industry, consulting, non-clinical tracks) Community Engagement and Partnership RECOMMENDATION Develop new and increase existing programs that support community engagement by students. \u00b7All graduate and professional programs should develop programs to effectively support community engagement by graduate students. This includes effective preparation prior to service and reflection after the initial engagement. Programs may integrate this into the curriculum, as through a community-based practicum, community service learning, clinical rotation, or a graduation requirement. Community engagement may also be encouraged and supported as a co-curricular opportunity. \u00b7Tisch College should be engaged as a strategic partner with each graduate school in developing programs and evaluations in this area. Tisch College has focused resources to facilitate, support, and promote engaged teaching, research, and co-curricular partnerships to further diversity and civic learning goals for Tufts students. Since Tisch College already collaborates with most schools and departments to co-develop and integrate community engagement opportunities to benefit students, faculty members, and community partners, Tisch could also work with them to institutionalize this in support of the university's diver - sity and inclusion objectives.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 59 APPENDICESAppendix E : Faculty Implementation Recommendations The work of the council on Diversity and its working groups, in addition to developing overarching recommendations, identified more specific recommendations based on their findings for programmatic and implementation. These recommendations need to be fur - ther analyzed and prioritized by the next iteration of the Council and under the purview of the Chief Diversity Officer and other faculty, staff, and administrators at the school and department level. Recruitment and Retention RECOMMENDATION Increase the diversity of the faculty to be more representative of increasing diversity in the student population. \u00b7The university and its schools should set annual and five-year goals for advancing diversity with progress toward achieving these goals built into annual assessments. \u00b7In addition to institutional support and oversight, local governance is critical to achieving success at the school level. Schools should commit to assigning a school-level designee (reporting directly to a dean of each school) to develop an action plan to monitor diversity hiring processes and their alignment with AAPs. Departments across the university need to monitor these and when hiring faculty members, especially tenure-stream, they should be seeking to ensure that their pools reflect the demographics in a given field. \u00b7Deans and department chairs should be expected to show evidence at annual assessments of proactive work that advances the diversity agenda. Deans should be evaluated on the effectiveness of faculty recruitment processes and their results in recruiting a truly diverse pool of candidates, refining the processes as needed. The current practices in A&S could serve as a model for developing practices for other schools in light of its recent successes. \u00b7The development of recruitment strategies should pay attention to the impact of econom - ics and geographic location as barriers to acceptance of offers and consider options such as a formal recruitment process which supports the identification of opportunities for employment for the spouses and partners of candidates. \u00b7Assessment of opportunities to promote work-life balance should consider initiatives such as housing and child-care support that have the opportunity to make a particular contribu - tion to the success in recruitment and retention of faculty from diverse backgrounds.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 60 APPENDICESMentoring and Professional Development RECOMMENDATION Increase the awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclusion in faculty through professional development programs and the creation of communities of practice and learning. \u00b7Enhance and develop university-wide mentoring programs by: \u00b7Creating formal mentoring programs and discussion groups that provide training on effective mentoring; and \u00b7Requiring demonstration of success in mentoring as a part of tenure and promotion processes. \u00b7The survey of graduate and professional students results suggest that faculty members and mentors play an important role in career advising. It is, therefore, important to ensure that all students have access to early and effective mentoring. We strongly recommend that all faculty members who serve in mentoring role for students be provided with the opportunity for faculty development and acquire skills necessary to be successful mentors. This will minimize variations in quality of mentoring. There should also be an evaluation process that allows for the identification of deficient mentoring and appropriate interven - tion. Exemplary mentors should be similarly recognized by the institution. \u00b7Faculty members at all levels need to be trained by experienced, professional diversity trainers to: \u00b7Recognize their own implicit assumptions about people, e.g., stereotypes, prejudgments or incorrect interpretations of behavior, ignorance of cultural practices; \u00b7Recognize difficult situations and learn strategies for resolving them. This includes harassment, bullying, and inappropriate behavior and/or use of language; \u00b7Develop best practices for recruiting and advancing students, post-doctoral fellows, staff, and faculty members; \u00b7Acquire coaching and mentoring skills. This should include successful methods such as those employed at Brown, Northwestern, UC Berkley and Wisconsin; \u00b7Recognize and cope with student stress, depression, and other forms of behavioral dys - function both for mainstream students and those from diverse cultures and backgrounds. \u00b7Faculty in AS&E are already asked to report annually (on the Faculty Information Form) their diversity-related activities. This information should be gathered and assessed for im - pact and to ensure that such activities are connected to other initiatives on campus. Much good work is being done but it is insufficiently supported and often goes unrecognized. \u00b7The Tufts teaching faculty should be strongly encouraged to take advantage of faculty development workshops that teach and promote skills and strategies for working with a diverse classroom. The Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching is a resource we would like to highlight in this regard. \u00b7Given the critical role of mentoring to the success of graduate and professional students, those who serve as mentors must receive faculty development and regular feedback to ensure consistent quality is maintained in all spheres of formal mentoring.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 61 APPENDICES \u00b7Increase the visibility of the Working with One Another policy, which establishes uniform guidelines to promote a work and educational environment that fosters respect and inclusion. \u00b7Ensure that faculty selection committees are trained for new diversity and inclusion hiring practices and workplace policies by developing and mandating diversity-related interview skills training focused on effectively selecting, identifying, and assessing diverse candi - dates prior to involvement on search committees. \u00b7Standardize a means for tracking faculty activities related to diversity and inclusion efforts, linking them to tenure and promotion criteria. \u00b7Develop opportunities or mechanisms to reward and incentivize outstanding, innovative, and transformative diversity/inclusion initiatives and diverse and inclusive mentorship. Such forms of recognition could take many forms, as appropriate, ranging from institution - al awards to monetary support and release time. \u00b7Offer informational sessions two to three times per year to present the many mentoring options and grant monies available to provide the type of mentoring desired by the partici - pants. In some cases participants are looking for mentoring specific to developing research opportunities, while another may be more interested in learning for a colleague outside their area of discipline. These programs could be a joint program of Human Resources and the Chief Diversity Officer, an arrangement that would allow for mentoring programs for staff, formal mentoring programs for faculty, and continued development of existing staff-student and faculty-student mentoring practices. Infusing Diversity in the Curriculum RECOMMENDATION Increase the awareness and understanding of issues of diversity and inclusion in faculty through training. \u00b7Provide incentives and rewards for faculty members to develop and contribute to a curriculum including focus on inclusion, dialogue across differences, and attention to the differential experiences of individuals and groups in terms of access to resources and in relation to power, privilege, and oppression (i.e., social justice); and to shape research agendas around pertinent issues. See also Undergraduate Student Experience Implementation Recommendations (page 49). \u00b7A common curricular experience during the first year that could serve multiple purposes, including teaching principles of social justice, intersectionality, and comparative perspec - tives across differences, both in the United States and global context, should be explored. \u00b7As the university moves forward in thinking about curricular review and reform, a peda - gogical focus on difference, inclusion, social justice, and global awareness must be a goal. Faculty members, departments, and programs should be incentivized and rewarded for shaping curriculum within their disciplines that also engage these issues. Feedback from seniors in 2013 included the recommendation that departments develop courses within the majors that address diversity and/or social justice as they pertain to the field. See also Undergraduate Student Experience Implementation Recommendations (page 49).Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 62 APPENDICESAppendix F : Staff Implementation Recommendations The work of the Council on Diversity and its working groups, in addition to developing overarching recommendations, identified more specific recommendations based on their findings for programmatic and implementation. These recommendations need to be further analyzed and prioritized by the next iteration of the Council and under the purview of the Chief Diversity Officer and other faculty, staff, and administrators at the school and department level. Recruitment, Hiring, and Promotion RECOMMENDATION Develop recruitment pipelines and new strategies for outreach to address systemic underrepresentation of specific groups within the staff. \u00b7The CDO, in collaboration with the Office of Equal Opportunity, should develop a Diversity Scorecard using AAP goals as a means of tracking progress against specific university-wide and school-level goals and metrics for staff and faculty members in the following areas: \u00b7Employee (Faculty/Staff) representation by position and level; \u00b7Recruitment, retention efforts and activities; \u00b7Promotion/internal mobility; \u00b7Develop mechanisms/vehicles by which issues of inequity and social justice can be reported, assessed, and addressed on an ongoing basis. Some metrics would be: a de - crease in the volume of issues, consistent and ongoing tracking and monitoring of issues, as well as timely and successful resolution of issues. \u00b7Develop and measure school/center-specific goals related to: \u00b7Hire rates that at least reflect available diverse applicant pools; \u00b7Increasing diversity representation within all levels of management staff, including diversity in senior management ranks in order to set the tone for the institution; \u00b7Develop and implement dean and/or center director performance evaluations that include metrics related to accountability for enhancing diversity efforts, including linkage to compensation and advancement; \u00b7Identifying and growing the diversity pipeline in highly technical areas, such as research scientists.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 63 APPENDICESCampus Climate RECOMMENDATION Articulate the meaning of diversity and include it as a core value in Tufts' mission and vision. \u00b7Review, evaluate, and replicate existing models of community and employee engagement such as Town Hall meetings, Staff and Faculty Surveys, Staff and Faculty Councils and/or Advisory groups such as the AS&E Feedback Group. \u00b7Promote and communicate diversity efforts in a variety of ways, for example: \u00b7Highlight efforts in newsletters. \u00b7Visible support by senior leadership; for example, it will send an important message for the President to continue chairing the Diversity Council in its next phase of existence. \u00b7Highlight diversity and inclusion as a core piece of the university homepage on the Web. Including literature about diversity and inclusion efforts on the Tufts website will increase transparency, assist continuous evaluation of ongoing efforts, and provide prospective students and employees with necessary information about university-wide diversity and inclusion initiatives. \u00b7Provide mandatory formal orientation for all new staff and faculty hires that incorporates and conveys Tufts' values and expectations related to diversity and inclusion, as well as training on social justice, oppression, privilege, and how to engage with students who are different from themselves. \u00b7Promote the Tufts Working with One Another policy more broadly. Many employees are unaware that Tufts already has articulated a set of expectations related to respect, civili - ty, and diversity. This policy is currently located in the Business Conduct Handbook and the Employee Handbook. The working group recommends that policy should also be publicized elsewhere with increased visibility of the policy throughout university spaces, and a more significant emphasis from senior and mid-level administrators on this policy as a set of workplace values. \u00b7Develop tools and resources which provide more opportunities to identify and address \"off value\" behavior. \u00b7Monitor and track employee satisfaction and engagement by conducting regular surveys, for example a periodic Climate Survey, to assess community cultural issues and concerns more deeply, using existing surveys (e.g., the At-Work Employee Survey for staff) as models.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 64 APPENDICESProfessional Development and Training RECOMMENDATION Increase staff competency in diversity and inclusion issues through training and professional development. \u00b7Incorporate topics, such as managing diverse populations, managing across generational and cultural differences, and promoting diversity and inclusion, into manager skills devel - opment programs, e.g., Foundations of Leadership (FOL) offered through Human Resources. Applicable parts of TUSDM's cultural competency curriculum could be used as a guide. \u00b7Ensure that hiring managers and faculty selection committees are trained for new diver - sity and inclusion hiring practices and workplace policies by developing and mandating diversity-related interview skills training focused on effectively selecting, identifying, and assessing diverse candidates prior to involvement on search committees and/or hiring staff. \u00b7Enhance and develop university-wide mentoring programs by: \u00b7Creating formal that provide mentoring training; \u00b7Revising the university's organizational and leadership competences to reflect mentor - ing of diverse direct reports as a core skill for all employees, and especially managers, linking mentoring to professional development goals; \u00b7Adding a feedback component for diversity and inclusion to performance reviews; \u00b7Requiring demonstration of successful mentoring as a part of tenure and promotion processes. \u00b7Offer informational sessions two to three times per year to present the many mentor - ing options and grant monies available to provide the type of mentoring desired by the participants. These programs could be a joint program of Human Resources and the CDO, an arrangement that would allow for mentoring programs for staff, formal mentoring programs for faculty members, and continued development of existing staff-student and faculty-student mentoring practices.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 65 APPENDICESAppendix G : Introduction to the Data : Categories and Groupings There are a variety of data sources that have been used in this report to shed light on diver - sity and inclusion at Tufts. Among these are Tufts-administered surveys, surveys adminis - tered by other agencies, institutional records, and federal databases. In the case of all federal data \u2014 such as data drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) \u2014 definitions of certain categories have been dictated by Federal statute. For example, the Federal government recognizes only two gender categories, male and female. In addition, the Federal government dictates the collection and reporting of racial/ethnic data according to a very specific scheme. In Federal race/ ethnicity reporting, all individuals who are not US Citizens or US Permanent Residents are classified as non-resident aliens, regardless of their country of origin. All individuals who identify as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic. All individuals who are not foreign and not Hispanic, and who identify as one and only one of the following categories, are classified in that category: American Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black, not of Hispanic origin; Hispanic; White. Finally, all non-foreign and non-Hispanic individuals who identify as one or more of the above categories are classified as Multiracial. For some of Tufts' internal data analysis, Federal racial/ethnic categories have been utilized \u2014 not because Tufts believes the government's categories are ideal, but because they are the current standard for classifying individuals into a single racial/ethnic category. In order to make statistically valid comparisons across groups of people, each individual person can fall in only one category. Rather than make ad hoc choices about how to classify individuals who have self-identified into multiple racial/ethnic categories, the Federal guidelines have been deferred to when necessary. It is important to note that in all of Tufts' diversity-related data, only self-identifications (of gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, religion, etc.) are used. That is, the \"categories\" used to describe individuals have all been self-selected at some point by members of the community, usually on applications, hiring forms, or survey instruments. On all survey instruments developed by Tufts' Office of Institutional Research and Evaluation (OIR&E), questions that ask individuals to self-identify into specific categories have both pre-defined choices as well as open-ended options, so that respondents can write in the identity that best describes themselves if they feel that the given options are not sufficient. All of OIR&E's analyses of survey data honor the self-identifications made by survey responses, even if these differ from what is recorded in institutional systems. In order to provide meaningful comparisons with this data among different Tufts groups, across different institutions, and over time \u2014 as well as to maintain the confidentiality of individuals \u2014 groupings of students, faculty, and staff are often made. For example, individuals who identify on a survey as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and/or transgender may be grouped together when examining the survey results. Similarly, survey responses from Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 66 APPENDICESstudents identifying as members of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups may be grouped together for analysis. These groupings are not made with the intention of suggesting that all individuals within a given grouping are somehow the \"same.\" Rather, the groupings are made in order to protect the identities of individuals while still allowing their voices to be heard. Protecting privacy and maintaining confidentiality of individuals and their survey responses is a high priority, and data from just a few individuals are never analyzed separately. Another reason individuals are often grouped together is that statistical analyses can only be reliably run when group sizes are sufficiently large. The alternative to grouping would be to omit responses from small groups, which Tufts does not wish to do.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 67 APPENDICESAppendix H : Undergraduate Student Data Table H.1. Undergraduate Students by Race \u00b7Among peer institutions, Tufts has consistently low enrollment of Black, Hispanic, and Asian undergraduates. \u00b7In 2011, Tufts had the lowest enrollment of Black or African American undergraduates among 11 peer institutions. In terms of Hispanic undergraduates, only Washington University ranked lower in 2011. \u00b7In 2011, Duke University had the highest percentage of Black undergraduate students among 11 peer schools at 9.7%, and Asian at 20.7%; Columbia had the highest percentage of Hispanic undergrads at 13.4%. \u00b7Since 2001, % of Black, Hispanic, and Asian undergraduates at Tufts has consistently decreased or plateaued.

Transfer Data Of the students who transferred to other institutions, White students made up a smaller proportion of transfer students than they did within the overall cohort of White students (i.e., among all students in the 2006 cohort who transferred out of Tufts, 48.8% were White, whereas White students comprised 60.9% of the entire 2006 cohort). The proportion of Black students who transferred was more than double the proportion of Black students in the overall 2006 cohort (i.e., among students who transferred, 7% were Black, whereas Black students comprised only 3.4% of the entire 2006 cohort). Similarly, the proportion of Hispanic and foreign students who transferred was approximately twice the amount of Hispanic and foreign students in the overall 2006 cohort (i.e., among students who transferred, 11.6% were Hispanic, whereas Hispanic students comprised only 6.3% of the entire 2006 cohort; among students who transferred, 9.3% were Foreign, whereas Foreign students comprised only 5.3% of the entire 2006 cohort). To summarize, for the 2006 cohort, proportionally higher percentages of Black, Hispanic, and Foreign students transferred out of Tufts.1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Diversity Report | December 2013 69 APPENDICESTable H.5. Typical/Recent Retention and Graduation Rates33 Sexual Misconduct and Bias Incidents First Year, First Week: survey administered by Health and Wellness Services among first-year students. The survey asks about experience with alcohol awareness and alcohol and drug use. In 2012, 44.2% of students responded. In response to when and where they drank alcohol in relation to their transition to Tufts, 2.9% reported drinking at April Open House; 4.8% at Pre-orientation program; 16.1% during their first night at Tufts; 36.9% at their Orientation program. In the context of questions about alcohol and drug use, 10% of respondents in 2012 reported receiving unwanted sexual attention during their first week on campus; 9.4% reported receiving unwanted sexual attention during their first week on campus as a result of someone else's drinking; and .2% (or 2 students) reported being sexually assaulted during their first week on campus as a result of someone else's drinking. In 2010 the numbers were 15.7%, 14.2% and .4%. This would suggest that interventions, alcohol awareness and educational initiatives around sexual misconduct are having a positive impact but more can be done. American College Health Association. American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment II: Tufts University, 2011.36 This data is based on information gathered from 601 diverse Tufts student respondents who responded from a randomly distributed survey across all student cohorts. The Tufts University Executive Summary for the spring of 2011 indicates findings related to students' experiences, over the previous 12 months, of sexual violence and intimate relationship violence: \u00b74.7% of males and 11.4% of females responded experiencing sexual touching without their consent \u00b72.3% of males and 2.7% of females responded experiencing sexual penetration attempt without their consent \u00b7.9% of males and 1.6% of females responded experiencing sexual penetration without their consent \u00b73.8% of males and 5.3% of females experienced stalking \u00b77.0% of males and 5.9% of females experienced an emotionally abusive relationship \u00b72.8% of males and 1.1% of females experienced a physically abusive intimate relationship Degree Retention Rates, Year 1 to 2 Degree Completion Rates Notes AS&E BA, BS, BE 95%-97%34100% time: 84%-87%35 150% time: 89%-92%100% time = 4 years 150% time = 6 years Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 70 APPENDICESOEO Incidents of Sexual Misconduct Reporting System37 Effective March 1, 2013, the Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO) at Tufts http://oeo.tufts.edu , upgraded the university's existing EthicsPoint reporting system and expanded the tool to encompass all reports (anonymous, third party, and known) of sexual misconduct university-wide. The reporting tool for sexual misconduct incidents was designed with discretion and confidentiality in mind and in accordance with the federal Office of Civil Rights (OCR) Best Practice guidelines, outlined in the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter to US colleges and universities. OEO also chose this tool because there is an option, with one click from a reporter, to keep the reporter anonymous if s/he wishes. In addition, there is also an option to engage with the anonymous reporter in a \"live chat.\" The expectation is that this tool, along with the educational rollout of the tool, will result in more reports of sexual misconduct incidents. OEO has also tailored the EthicsPoint tool to fit the important and discrete needs of those involved in sexual misconduct matters. OEO is now able to run de-identified analytics on all areas and aspects of reported sexual misconduct cases with the intent of identifying trends, patterns, and areas of concern. The hope is that with these new data analytics (e.g., location, date of incident, date reported, sexual misconduct type), OEO and OEO's partners on each campus will be able to tailor the education, training, and responses to sexual misconduct matters in a way that better addresses prevention and victim safety. Reported Incidents of Bias - September, 2012-December 2012, Summary of incidents on Medford Campus38 A summary of incidents of bias has been made available at the end of each semester to students through Webcenter39 and includes all incidents of bias targeting a person or community based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity and expression. Incidents may be reported through the web-based reporting process or listed at the request of community members as long as the incident described targeted a person or community based on the aforementioned criteria. Since not all incidents are brought forward, the summary may not fully reflect the experience of the community. Confidentiality is maintained but the university has a policy of full disclosure of incidents that are reported by members of the community if the report meets the criteria for inclusion. Reporting an incident for the purpose of inclusion in this summary does not initiate a judicial complaint.40 Outcomes: From September through November 2012, 13 incidents of bias were reported on Webcenter: \u00b78 incidents reported (or 60%) were related to gender or sexual orientation; \u00b71 incident reported was related to gender and race; \u00b71 incident reported was related to race; \u00b72 incidents reported were related to religion; \u00b71 incident reported was related to ethnic or national origin.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 71 APPENDICESSenior Survey Data Senior Surveys: COFHE (comparative) 2012 and 2011 The metrics included here derive from the COFHE (Consortium on Financing Higher Education)41 2012 Senior Survey: Analysis by Race and Ethnicity; White, Asian American, Black or African American, Hispanic of all races, Non-resident aliens (excluded because of small sample sizes: Unknown, Two or more races, American Indian/Native American, Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian); and from the Tufts Senior Survey, 2011. Note: the racial/ethnic categories employed here are those used in the COFHE survey and cannot therefore be modified for Tufts. (Unless otherwise noted, the response scale was: 1 Very Dissatisfied; 3 Generally Satisfied; 5 Very Satisfied) (B/AA = Black/African American; AAM = Asian American; H W = White; NR = Non-resident alien) NOTE: statistically significant differences between particular groups are indicated in bold and by pairing groups in relation to one another, e.g., B/AA vs. (versus) W; numbers for groups not in bold are included for reference but do not reveal statistically significant differences in satisfaction levels. Among the most startling findings are those that suggest that students from historically underrepresented groups, especially Black or African American and Hispanic, continue to face acute challenges in regard to campus climate, academic achievement and faculty mentoring, and co-curricular experience:42 Satisfaction levels:43 \u00b7In most comparison schools as well as at Tufts, Black/African American students were least satisfied (and White students most satisfied) with the overall college experience and community on campus. \u00b7Overall satisfaction: H; 4.06 AAM; 4.18 W White females were most likely to say they would choose Tufts again if they were to relive their college experience; underrepresented minority females were the least likely. White females were the only group to give an average rating higher than \"probably would.\"44 Diversity experiences:45 \u00b7Tufts students are on average less than \"generally satisfied\" with the ethnic/ racial diversity on campus and the climate for minority students.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 72 APPENDICES \u00b7Compared to other campuses asking about diversity experiences and campus climate, Tufts ranks in the lower half. \u00b7On average, students at Tufts report \"often\" having conversations with students who differ from them in terms of race/ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic background, and sexual orientation; however, Tufts ranks at the bottom of comparison schools in terms of frequency with which students report interacting with students diverse in race/ethnicity, nationality, and socioeconomic background. \u00b7Tufts ranks higher in terms of frequency of conversations with students diverse in sexual orientation. \u00b7Students at Tufts are more satisfied than many others with the climate for LGBTQ students. \u00b7It is worth noting that LGB46 students at Tufts report a slightly higher level of satisfaction overall (4.24) compared to heterosexual students (4.18); however this is slightly lower than our peer institutions; a similar pattern holds for LGB or heterosexual students at Tufts recommending the university to a peer. While the UWG is encouraged by these findings, important work remains to be done to ensure that LGBTQ students feel safe and equally empowered (see page 76 for Healthy Minds Survey). \u00b7Underrepresented minority females and Asian American males experienced emotional distress more often than other groups.47 \u00b7LGBTQ students more likely than other students to experience emotional distress.48 Campus climate:49 \u00b7Minority climate (Black/African American students 3.06 NR; 2.63 H; 2.88 W; and 2.63 H vs. 2.06 NR \u00b7Ethnic and racial diversity (Black/African American students were least 2.61 H; and 2.61 H vs. 3.00 NR \u00b7Frequency with which students report interacting with students who differ by race or ethnicity from themselves (1 = Never; 3 = Often; 4 = Very Often): 3.01 W vs. 3.38 NR; 3.36 B/AA; 3.36 2.88 NR White males and females reported lowest levels of experience with cultural life on campus.

In almost all areas related to volunteering, nonprofit work, and personal convictions, females reported being more civically engaged than their male counterparts. White males consistently reported the lowest level of civic engagement of any group.66 LGBTQ students were more satisfied with and more likely to participate in community service opportunities. They were also more likely to feel Tufts improved their understanding of societal issues, and a higher percentage of LGBTQ students plan to be civically engaged after Tufts.67 Study abroad:68 Perhaps as a reflection of Tufts' orientation toward global awareness, participation rates are slightly higher for all groups compared to our peer institutions. \u00b753% W vs. going abroad their junior year. The proportionately small population of B/AA students on campus makes the gap between their participation in study abroad and that of other students, especially White students, statistically less significant; nevertheless, the UWG is concerned that historically disenfranchised students may not enjoy equal access or feel empowered to participate in study abroad, especially given that 32% of B/AA students report foregoing study abroad for financial abroad for financial reasons.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 75 APPENDICESAcademic achievement:69 It should be noted that studies show that racial and ethnic disparities in college completion and achievement are not exclusive to Tufts but are national problems.70 \u00b7At Tufts (and comparison schools), Hispanic and Black/AA students reported receiving low - er grades on average than students in any other group. Means computed based on their responses suggest that Black/African American students earned an average grade of 3.09 compared to Hispanic students who reported an average grade of 3.29; Asian American students who reported an average grade of 3.41 and White students who reported an average grade of 3.5. \u00b7Average NR; 3.50 W Self-reported information on academic achievement has been corroborated by other data gathered by OIR&E for the UWG. \u00b7From 2001- 2011, graduates in the top 25% of their college by gender, and race and ethnicity were as follows: female 26%; male 21%; White percentage of first-years on the Dean's list their first semester were as follows: White 58%; Asian 49%; Black 17%; Hispanic 32%; International 37%. \u00b7At Tufts, students graduated in STEM majors at the following rates: 46% Tufts and in all comparison groups, Black/African American and Hispanic students are least likely to follow through on expectations of majoring in STEM: 84% NR vs. 25% B/AA \u00b7At Tufts, the proportion of B/AA students following through with a STEM major is particularly low. \u00b7STEM majors at graduation: 32% W \u00b7Tufts has the lowest levels, among its peer schools, of female students (24%) majoring in STEM fields (male students 41%).71 Administration; Security:72 \u00b7Only at Tufts are B/AA students noticeably less satisfied than others with the administra - tion's responsiveness to student concerns. \u00b7Satisfaction rate NR W; AAM 2.65; H 2.75 \u00b7B/AA students are least likely to be satisfied with the feeling of security on campus: 2.95 B/AA vs. 3.34 W; AAM 3.24; H 3.24; NR 3.24Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 76 APPENDICESHealthy Minds Study In spring 2010, 4,000 Tufts undergraduate and graduate students in AS&E were invited to participate in the Healthy Minds Study.

Microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults toward people of color or other marginalized groups. Perpetrators of microaggressions are often unaware that they engage in such communications when they interact with racial/ethnic minorities. See Derald Wing Sue et al., \"Racial Microaggressions in Everyday Life,\" in American Psychologist , May-June 2007, p. 271. Microaggressions in the classroom can include [but are not limited to]: Not correcting other students' biased assumptions in class, statements that dismiss or invalidate the student of color's racial reality or perspective, failure to provide a safe space for students to share their reality or perspective, failure to explicitly address issues of marginal/privileged identities in class in an informed way, unwillingness to accept a different racial reality from students of color, lack of attention to course materials that might contain microaggressions. See Derald Wing Sue et al., \"Racial Microaggressions and Difficult Dialogues on Race in the Classroom,\" in Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 2009, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 183- 190. 13.

It is important to underscore the fact that the university never adopted a need-blind admissions policy but it was able to practice need-blind admissions for two years, admitting the classes of 2011 and 2012 under this practice. The economic crisis forced Tufts to pull back from the need-blind practice for the class of 2013.Tufts University | Council on Diversity Report | December 2013 98 19.

SJLI runs leadership training workshops once in the fall; in the spring semester higher participation rate requires three workshops run over three consecutive days, including an outside expert. In 2012, a total of 166 students participated, including students associated with the G6 Centers, Greek Life, Residential Life, Orientation leaders, Programming Board, and unaffiliated students. In 2013, participants from the ACE Fellows Program, Academic Resource Center, Tisch College, FIT, and Athletics are also anticipated to join. See >> Appendix H . 28.

Hispanic males (82.4%) and Black Females (80%) had the lowest six-year graduation rate (Note: the graduation rate for Black Females decreased from 88% in 2011). 31. Hispanic males (82.2%) and Black Females (88%) had the lowest six-year graduation rate. 32. Includes full and part-time students. 33. Source: S-Forms, 2013 Comprehensive Evaluation. Reported time to degree is dependent upon individual program requirements. 34. About half of students who leave do so because they have transferred to another institution. 35. The four-year graduation rate of 87% for the 2007 cohort was the highest of the past decade. 36. American College Health Association.

The Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) is an institutionally supported organization of 31 highly selective, private liberal arts colleges and universities. COFHE data collection, research, and policy analysis focus on matters pertaining to access, affordability, and assessment, particularly as they relate to undergraduate education, admissions, financial aid, and the financing of higher education. Tufts is not a member of COFHE, but it occasionally gets invited to participate in the COFHE senior survey and can then analyze the data from all participating institutions (and invited guests) comparatively. Tufts also asks additional questions that come after the COFHE survey, which are separate and Tufts-only. 42. COFHE Senior Survey, 2012: Analysis by Race/Ethnicity. 43.

Reported time to degree is dependent upon individual program requirements. 74. At the graduate level, the first- to second-year retention rate is not as meaningful a metric as it is for undergraduate. The effort required to calculate the rate is time-intensive. Given the implementation of the new SIS and the need to reallocate staffing for this project, retention data for GSAS and GSOE are not available at this time. 75. This is comparable to national averages. There is a wide range of graduation rates amongst the various GSAS doctoral degree programs. 76. Two percent switched to the PhD program by the end of the second year; two percent switched to the PhD program by the end of the third year. 77. The lowest graduation rate is in the GMAP mixed residential/distance learning degree because of difficulty combining the program workload with a (near) full-time professional workload. 78. First- to second-year retention rate is not applicable for the one-year MA program. 79. Over 97% go on to internship/residency. Flexibility to pursue research concentrations resulted in 18% taking five years to complete. 80. The calendar years will vary annually until the program has three to five years of results to determine actual expected time to degree. 81. Rates calculated using students who complete Year 2 and enroll in Year 3 (does not include students who do not return after Year 2). 82. A small percentage of students who leave repeat the year and join the next class. "}
