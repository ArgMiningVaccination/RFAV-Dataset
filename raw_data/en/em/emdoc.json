BACKGROUND There is rising demand for Children's Services nationally and locally , with increasingly complex presentations of need which are emerging in younger children, as well as adolescents . Social and economic s trains on families mean we need to be innovative in how we engage and work with them. In Plymouth t he expiry of a number of key commissioned contracts allows an opportunity to think differently about how services are provided and their effectiveness. In addition, b udget pressures mean we need to maximise the effectiveness of every pound of public money in delivering good quality services , and increase the focus on prevention , designed to reduce need, intervene early and deliver both better outcomes and reduce demand for specialist services. Plymouth has a range of services in place which already work well with families; these are embedded in communities, trusted by families and have an in depth understanding of local needs. These include the city -wide network of Children's Centres, which deliver a range of provision from drop in groups to more intensive support for families with children aged 0 -5. Plymouth also has a strong history in recent years of working collaboratively with partners to think creatively and overcome organisational boundaries to try new approaches. Recent successes include the development of Access, a multi -partner approach (Plymouth City Coun cil, Livewell Southwest, University Hospitals Plymouth) to supporting families with children and young people with additional needs. This work has developed a shared \"front door\", and multi -disciplinary team approach to considering who is most appropriate to work with the child or young person. In 2018, a contract was awarded to Livewell Southwest to deliver community health, wellbeing and SEND support services across Plymouth. This procurement aimed to build upon the existing integration work to improve system working. It provided a mechanism for services to be developed with a focus on the offer for prevention, supporting resilience and providing the right support at the right time, moving the system towards prevention and early help. Other partnership w orking in relation to Early Help and Targeted Support has included the Vulnerable Children and Young People System Optimisation Group (VCYP SOG) , Maternity and Early Years SOG (MEY SOG) and SEND Strategy Steering Group , all reporting to the Children and Young People System Design Group (CYP SDG). These are group s of system partners who meet regularly to discuss system issues as they arise for children and their families and the configuration of services to best meet need; th ese are the key group of partne r stakeholders in relation to this initial business case and relationships are well established. This partnership working has attracted other projects that are of national significance such as the NSPCC's Together for Childhood and Barnardo's Care Journeys Partnership . 2. THE CASE FOR CHANGE There are challenges to fully effective partnership working in Plymouth; f amilies tell us the current Early Help and Targeted Support offer is fragmented and confusing , delivered by different providers in different buildings, using a range of approaches. The offer for families with children aged 0 -5 is distinct from those for families of older children and young people, 2 OFFICIAL which is not helpful when families have children w ith a range of ages and needs . The delivery of support is not always sequenced or coordinated effectively , so families may feel they are receiving services in a way that is overwhelming , risking duplication , or conversely feel they are left unsupported or passed between services . Professionals working with families describe not always know ing where to go for advice and discussions about sharing and managing risk , and navigating multiple referral pathways , referral forms or thresholds to access services . Schools are often unclear about what support is available to enable them to manage needs in a community setting. The consultation process recommended by this business case will help to inform a communication plan around the new offer to ensure everyone kno ws what the Early Help and Targeted Support offer is and where to access it including the online offer through Plymouth Online Directory ( POD). Currently we are not consistently intervening early enough to be able to prevent escalation of need; indicators include the numbers of children and young people entering the care system , the rate of exclusions from schools, first time entrants to the criminal justice system and a cohort of ch ildren and young people escalating into crisis, at significa nt emotional and financial cost. As a result, the resource available is at risk of being diverted away from Early Help into managing more costly crisis responses , further compounding the challenges of identifying and reducing need early. Other areas of the country are finding new ways to work with their families which is having an impact; for example North Yorkshire's \"No Wrong Door\" flexible and child -focussed offer of support has been effective in reducing emerging crisis and has been recognised by Ofsted as a positive approach. The local authority has subsequently seen a 15% reduction in the numbers of children and young people entering the care system. Locally, ACCESS is working towards this developing these processes in Plymouth with partners such as PC C, UHP and Livewell S outhwest. Going forward w e would seek to align the Plymouth Excellence Cluster ( PEC) intake meeting for the Multi -Agency Support Team (MAST) with ACCESS. In terms of Alterative Complimentary Education (ACE), these alignments will be developed th rough closer partnership working . Another challenge locally is in relation to the geographical configuration of services; currently the Children's Centres are organised over six \"clusters\", but these do not align to the health localities in Plymouth. This can act as a barrier to integrated working and we also know that people in some isolated parts of the city won't travel to a resource so we need to develop a more flexible delivery model to reach as many people as possible . There is an oppor tunity to do something transformative to improve the experience and outcomes of children and young people by taking a whole family approach to Early Help and Targeted Support and supporting professionals to work together , raise the aspiration for all Plymo uth children and young people to have the Best Start to Life, access the support in the right place and the right time and manage risk in a sustainable way. There is a need to create friendly, bustling, safe spaces where families feel comfortable to engag e, whether they have a toddler or a teen. Our system partners are keen to join us on this journey an d work together to enable change . 3. EXISTING SERVICES Early Help and Targeted Support are currently delivered through a mix of in -house , externally commissioned services and non -commissioned offers . The offer to families with 3 OFFICIAL children aged 0 -5 is well coordinated through C hildren's Centres , however the offer for older children and young people is more scattered across different services and agencies . There is also a lack of coordination of services around families who have children who range between 0 -19 yrs.

PROPOSAL - EARLY HELP It is proposed t o deliver an effective integrated Early Help offer by making the best use of the current children's centre estate (currently 1 5 Children's Centre and 3 satellite sites) to create a network of community -based Family Hubs1, offering support to children and young people aged 0 -19, their families and carers. The Family Hubs are a logical progression for Children's Centres to maximis e existing, trusted community resources. The development of Family Hubs is based on the following s ystem principles: 1 Family Hubs: The Future of Children's Centres. Strengthening family relationships to improve the Life Chances of everyone. APPG on Children's Centres (July 2016). Citywide network of Family Hubs, offering: Health and Development Employment Support and Childcare Relationship support for family stability Supporting families with complex needs 6 OFFICIAL 1. Prevention is a fundamental aspect of p rovision - priorit ising early identific ation of children and young people's needs and risks to health and wellbeing to help avoid illness or harm . 2. Early help should be embedded across the s ystem - children, young people & families offered help and information early in their life and in the development of specific health, care and/or educational needs. 3. Innovation & evidence based p rovision - we will continuously strive to improve the lives of children and young people through innovat ion and ensuring the best practice and current evid ence of what works is used by existing practic e and systems. 4. Sustainability is k ey - Using early h elp to help driv e sustainability of the system and also ensure efficiency and effectiveness through techno logy and good workforce management. 5. Systems should be r esponsive & accessible - respond ing to the changing population needs , designed with children, young people & families and delivered at the right time and place. 6. Services should be p ersonalised & use a strengths based approach - developing choice and control for children, young people & families using information to personalise the response. 7. Build upon the strength and resilience of i ndivi duals, families & communities - value and enable the role of fam ilies and communities in developing and sustaining happiness, wellness, health, and safety. Empower children, young people & families to help themselves, build resilience and safely manage risks. 8. Systems & services s hould be integrated - a common focus on delivering outcomes for children, young people & families within a coordinated experience and manage risks . There is 'no wrong door' and professionals are able to work across the system to deliver the best possible service including sharing information to devel op and deliver effective practic e. 9. Trauma Informed Models of Working - A trauma -informed workforce will deliver an integrated response to trauma recovery , using a whole family approach. This will incorporate relationship based working, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and other vulnerabilities as part of the ethos. The four key areas for the Family Hubs model are further described below: Health & Development - Building on Children's C entres' current role in early intervention, particularly early years where support has the biggest impact on long - term outcomes. Supporting the health and development of children aged 0 -5 will be integral to the offer, with services ideally provided on a universal basis where this is feasible. Emplo yment Support & Childcare - Building parents' confidence is a crucial element of effective employment support. Family hubs will deliver learning opportunities and support, as they represent a friendly, non -threatening environment. This aspirational cultur e can encompass broader provision to benefit children's outcomes, linking with local employers, Jobcentre Plus and provision of early education and childcare. 7 OFFICIAL Relationship Support for Family Stability - The quality of the parental relationship can have a s ignificant impact on children's development. Family hubs are well placed to deliver relationship support such as couple relationship counselling and courses and parenting support. The relationships approach should also be embedded across Family hub staff a nd partners including appropriate training to have the right kinds of conversations with parents. Voluntary sector organisations with a proven track record of best practice could be co -located or signposted to from family hubs. Supporting Families with Com plex Needs - The family hub model would offer valuable benefits, bringing together professionals and helping to embed shared approaches, particularly those on the edge of needing specialist support. Lessons will be learned from the FWAF programme, to suppo rt families before crisis point. The Family Hub model is a 'one -stop-shop' for families with children of all ages, offering support and signposting. Therefore, adoption of this approach would satisfy the statutory duties su bscribed within the Sure Start Ch ildren's C entres statutory guidance for local authorities, commissioners of local health services and Jobcentre Plus April 2013 and enhance the provision by widening their scope to include older children. The model will follow the i -Thrive Framework2. The locations of Family Hubs would need to align with local need and the most effective children's centre buildings, whilst recognising the interfaces with the Wellbeing Hubs and other community services to improve outcomes. The relative location of the ci ty's schools is also important in building a visible network of support for children, young people and families and professionals . The future Saltram Meadows housing development is being considered as part of the estates strategy . Co-location of staff will be central to the success of multi-agency working within the Family Hubs ; this may be on a permanent or \"hot -desking\" basis. Family Hubs would need to function collaboratively with the proposed network of Wellbeing Hubs and other community assets such as schools , to ensure a \"no wrong front door\" approach to the system. There will also be opportunities to develop reciprocal arrangements for inter - generational working by engaging with grandparents or retired volunteers to work with practitioners and par ents/carers to support families to realise their full potential. This will be part of the drive to reduce loneliness as part of the city's Loneliness Action Plan. The Family Hub model would be underpinned by the use of the Early Help Assessment Tool (EHAT) to assess, share information and request involvement from early help services. The Single Assessment will continue to be utilised for families where concerns have escalated to statutory level, drawing on the information al ready gathered in the EHAT. An E arly Help outcomes -based plan and review process would be the method of monitoring progress for children and young people , with a system outcomes framework for partners , to ensure that visibility of need and the impact of interventions is known. The Lead Pr ofessional role will be central to completion of the EHAT and the subsequent development and monitoring of the outcomes plan and stepdown. 2 http://www.implementingthrive.org/about -us/the -thrive -framework/ 8 OFFICIAL Family Hubs would enable universal service provision to reach up, and targeted support provision to reach down, to provide wrap -around support for children, young people & families. This would not require all interventions to be delivered on site, but would enable the Family Hubs to be used as a base for professional networking, co -location and working creatively as o ne \"team\". The aim is for Family Hubs to feel welcoming and supportive; places where families know they can go for help without feeling judged or stigmatised. The Family Hubs should also been seen as places that empower and support the communities to promo te positive outcomes as well as address need e.g. peer support and Information Advice and Guidance ( IAG). Children, Young People and Families could access Family Hubs by simply walking into any building, or by being signposted from their child's school or via a professional or member of their community , but receive support wherever is most comfortable and appropriate for them. The contact information would be available to families online if they wanted to make contact using other methods e.g. email or telephone. This flexibility of delivery will help to ensure maximum engagement with services by families from isolated communities and encourage outreach delivery into the community. There would be opportunities for health partners, VCS organisations, services supporting schools and other interested partners to deliver activities and interventions from the buildings for children, young people & families, via staff or volunteers including peer suppor ters. We would expect Family Hubs and other related staff to be appropriately skilled and knowledgeable in order to support families and have a trauma informed approach to their interactions from the first point of contact. In addition to the four key areas for the Family Hubs above, t he multi -agency approach will assist with planning of key childhood transition points from pregnancy onwards through all education phases , improve school readiness and work with schools to improve attendance and attainment of pupils. 5. PROPOSAL - TARGETED SUPPORT Targeted support offers a more intensive level of support for children, young people & families with complex needs, either over a short or longer term period of time. These services aim to reduce the need for statu tory intervention , improve better outcomes and reduce trauma for children and young people , but also to identify those families where change and improvement are more difficult to achieve and sustain. It is proposed to create a small number of Targeted Support Teams; located so that they work across a city-wide footprint. These would be an opportunity for co -location of practitioners working with more complex families in order to work creatively together, including shared assessments of need and risk, to ensure that any service offer is collectively managed and sequenced by a multi -disciplinary approach. Families could be referred to the Targeted Suppo rt teams via Access, the Gateway/Hub , or via the Family Hubs. All requests for support would be triaged using a multi -disciplinary team approach to consider who would be most skilled to work with the child or family. Professionals will be deployed from the Targeted Support Teams on the basis of need to support Family Hubs staff and deliver interventions to families in the community, including in family homes, Family Hubs or other community sites such as schools . Services would not be delivered where the Tar geted Support Teams are located to avoid possible stigmatisation of families accessing the associated buildings. The Targeted Support Teams would offer 9 OFFICIAL services such as crisis response to prevent escalation , either for individuals or communities , as well a s an interface with related services such as the Complex Lives Alliance. The learning from the development of the Wellbeing Hubs , 0-19 CHWB&SEND Support Service mobilisation , Together for Childhood pilot , Supported Living Positive Behaviour Support pilot and the Complex Lives Alliance will be utilised to inform how we work with our partners and communities. The Early Help and Targeted Support offer will allow for any future national Early Help programmes to align with our model such as the next phase of FWAF programme. The figure 2 below shows the services in scope of the new model of delivery. 10 OFFICIAL Figure 2 Proposed Services in Scope HEALTH & DEVELOPMENT Family Hubs Community Youth Service EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT & CHILDCARE Family Hubs RELATIONSHIP SUPPORT FOR FAMILY STABILITY Family Hubs Community Youth Service Parenting Programmes SUPPORTING FAMILIES WITH COMPLEX NEEDS Family Hubs Targeted Support Teams incl.

ESTATES STRATEGY Currently there are fifteen Department for Education \" designated \" Children's Centre sites and three satellite sites used to support service delivery of sixteen Children's Centres ; initial building surveys have been carried out on the se sites. More in depth surveys will be carried out as part of the development of the final business case. Early indications from the estates strategy has told us that twelve of the current children's centre sites could continue to operate and be developed into 0 -19 Family Hubs. We would also consider the use of a number of satellite sites to support local service delivery . We are considering the relocat ion of the C hildren's Centre \"designation \" on two sites and whether these could be transferred to other existing Chil dren's Centre sites; this would apply to two Children's Centre 's because the current buildings are not fit for purpose as Family Hub s due to being relatively small and unsuitable . It is pe rmissible under DfE guidance to combine more than one Children's Centre designation onto one site; an example of this was the bringing together of Lark and Popin Children's Centres in North Prospect - although based in one building the Children's Centres h ave different geographical footprints for delivering services to families. One other Children's Centre building could be used to accommodate a Targeted Support Team as it is better suited to office accommodation than a Family Hub. Other building s have yet to be identified as possible Targeted Support and Family Hub locations. There may be opportunit ies for efficiencies by co -locating staff from other sites into fewer building s where we are currently paying rent and other charges. The position is summarised below: Current position Possible future position (to be confirmed in final business case) 12 current Children's Centre buildings Develop into 0 -19 Family Hubs 1 current Children's Centre building Develop into a Targeted Support team building 2 current Children's Centre buildings Transfer the Children's Centre designation to other Family Hub sites and release the buildings 3 satellite sites Consider whether these are fit for purpose and what else is needed Identify an additional Targeted Support team building Identify other buildings where teams are currently located which may not be needed as teams integrate and co -locate As part of the proposed consultation, Facilities Management will further consider more in - depth building surveys, the cost of running the buildings, and any maintenance work needed to bring them up to date. The evaluation criteria and space requirements (see Appendix 2) will be used in the se surveys which were developed using feedback from the consultation in 12 OFFICIAL autumn 2018 ( see App endix 1 ) and knowledge of the services required. This will help to determine which sites would operate most effectively as Family Hubs and which could house the Targeted Support Teams. However, other delivery sites may be considered as part of the consultation. The Estates Strategy will also develop an understanding of the physical community assets available alongside the existing buildings. The community asset maps include schools, Wellbeing Hubs, nurseries, libraries and Ch ildren's Centres and will be shared as part of the consultation . There will be an emphasis on the expansion of the utilisation of other community assets as part of the development of Family Hubs. This will support t he flexibility of delivery of services to our more isolated communities. The overall efficiencies from the estate strategy will be included in the final business case when the consultation and building surveys have been concluded . The DfE clawback for capital funding may have implications on the change of use of some of the C hildren's Centre buildings so this will need to be considered as part of the estates strategy. 7. EVIDENCE FOR CHANGE - NEEDS ANALYSIS A needs analysis has been carried out, using profiles for each neighbourhood and grouped by locality. This covered a range of indicators including measures to represent the locality demographic and the four key areas of health and development; employment, support and childcare; relationship support f or family stability and supporting families with complex needs. The summary headlines from each locality is summarised below, whilst the needs analysis will be published as a supporting paper to this initial business case (see Appendix 3). Health Locality Map Figure 3 Map showing the current Children's Centres against the Health Locality boundaries. 13 OFFICIAL Note: The West Locality has recently been \"divided\" into two community health teams with the souther n boundary of the Wolseley Road; 'Beacon Barton, and Beacon Park and; South' Ford, Morice Town, Devonport, Stonehouse and Stoke . East locality The locality has a lower deprivation score compared to Plymouth. Overall, the measures for this locality show more favourable results when compared to the Plymouth average. In the locality there tends to be better educational and healthy lifestyles outcomes, however the locality shows a mixed picture (similar to the city) for self -esteem, resilience, young carers and using substances & alcohol. North locality The locality has a similar deprivation score compared to Plymouth , but there is marked variation between it s constituent neighbourhoods . Overall, the majority of the measures for this locality show similar results compared to Plymouth . However this obscures a wider variation of more and less favourable results when viewed across the neighbourhoods . In the loca lity there is a m ixed picture around healthy lifestyles and safety , with a higher proportion of pupils reporting being a victim of violence or aggression in the area they live, but a lower proportion of violence in the home. In the locality there tends to be a higher proportion of adults with no qualifications . 14 OFFICIAL South locality The locality has a similar deprivation score compared to Plymouth, but there is marked variation between its constituent neighbourhoods. Overall, the majority of the measures for this locality show similar results compared to Plymouth. However this obscures a wider variation of more and less favourable results when viewed across the neighbourhoods. Across the locality there are better healthy lifestyles outcomes with a higher proport ion of children with a healthy weight in reception and year 6 and a lower proportion of pupils reporting use of substances, alcohol and cigarettes. This locality also has a lower proportion of adults with no qualifications, however it should be noted that University of Plymouth is situated within the locality. The locality has a higher under 18 conception rate and proportion of families with young children that have separated or divorced in the last year. A number of neighbourhoods experience a lower lif e expectancy. West locality The locality has a higher deprivation score compared to Plymouth. Overall the majority of indicators across all four key areas show an unfavourable picture when compared to the Plymouth average. However there tends to be a higher proportion of children registered with a children centre and a lower proportion of pupils reporting drinking alcohol. There is a mixed picture around safety due to the locality having a number of neighbourhoods with high or low proportion of pupils being a victim of violence or aggression in the area, and the same pattern exists for violence at home. In the locality there tends be a worse outcome for healthy lifestyles and a higher proportion of the families are vulnerable. 8. EVIDENCE FOR CHANGE - OVERVIEW OF PROVISION IN OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES As part of the development of the initial business case there has been a review of other local authority practice relating to Family Hubs, Children's Centres and Early Help offers, particularly for families with 0 -19 year olds. The LGA EH research report also refers to models in several local authorities3. Some examples of these are shown below : Essex County Council - Child and Family Wellbeing Service for children from 0 to19 (or 25 for young people with SEND) is commissioned jointly with health. The service is delivered through a combination of Family Hub and delivery sites. Leicestershire County Council - Early years support for children under 5 and targeted whole family support for children aged 0 -19 through integrated service delivery. Isle of Wight Council - Barnardo's deliver locality based Family Centre's for families from conception to teenage years. There is support on site, short and long term family support available. North Yorkshire County Council - CSC Service has become the first in the country to be rated \"outstanding\" in all areas by Ofsted, after achieving a 15% reduction in the number of young people taken into care and savings of about \u00a35m. This achievement has been credited to preventing families from reaching crisis point 3 Key enablers in developing an effective partnership -based early help offer: final research report (LGA, Marc h 2019) . 15 OFFICIAL rather than waiting for a family to be in crisis. The Minister for Children and Families, Nadhim Zahawi, said the successes at North Yorkshire should be replicated at councils around the country. Reading Borough Council - Children's Centre's have r ecently been commissioned into four clusters and families can access a wid e range of services including speech and language, SEND support, parenting support, school readiness opportunities and benefits checks etc. Kent County Council - combination of C hildren's Centre's and Youth Hubs in each district to deliver the universal an d EH offer and the intensive family support to offer more targeted support. A focus on the development of partners' distinctive role of Early Help. 9. EVIDENCE FOR CHANGE - FEEDBACK FROM FAMILIES AND PROFESSIONALS In autumn 2018 a consultation was carried out with families and professionals to test whether the model of Family Hubs and Targeted Support Teams was an appropriate way of delivering Early Help and Targeted Support. The consultation comprised an online s urvey, visits to seventeen Children's Centre's or Satellite Sites across the six clusters and visits to relevant strategic meetings (e.g. SOGs, PSCB MACSE, CSPB, Young Carers conference etc.) to discuss the consultation and participation in the survey. The Early Help and Targeted Support public consultation opened on the PCC consultation portal on September 5th and closed on 31st October 2018. There were over 244 responses received; 129 responses from families and 95 responses from professionals. Commissio ning and Early Years completed the family survey with 57 families. Some families chose to complete the survey themselves and send responses direct through the Children's Centre's . Both professionals and families broadly agree d with the direction of travel towards the Family Hubs (see Appendix 1 for more detail) : Both families and professionals agree that services should be delivered in a variety of settings. The setting will be dependent upon the service and the individual circumstances of the family. Friendly, non -judgemental and welcoming environment s with staff that fami lies were familiar with were vital to them feeling safe and happy seeking help. Therefore, the retention of the universal offer will be important to continu e to build this trust so that help can be accessed at the earliest point, if required. There is a need for b etter access to information about the offer and how to access it locally. Partnership working between Family Hubs and other local community provision can be maximised by having good communication, clear pathways and opportunities to joint work cases / share skills. The o ffer could work with schools by inviting them to be part of local multi -agency stakeholder meetings, good communication, allo wing direct referrals and having a link with the local Family Hubs. 16 OFFICIAL There were c oncerns raised which related to needing more clarity on the proposed model (for professionals), communication about changes and ensuring adequate resourcing for the offer. 10.

RISKS & IMPACT Description Mitigation of Risk Financial savings required prior to implementation of the new model may compromise the delivery of the future Early Help and Targeted Support offer Risk assess proposed efficiencies to ensure future delivery is not undermined Co-design the specification for the new service to ensure partners are engaged in and understand future requirements IT has a 3 month lead in time and secure links are required by some partners to work effectively Ensure that the transition period to the new model of delivery is at least 3 months to account for the lead in time with IT infrastructure. Include IT requirements in the estate strategy evaluation criteria to see if the buildings have the capability for IT including tele meeting / teleconferenc ing facilities. Partner capacity and interest in the opportunity to bid for or be involved in the new model may be limited Ensure that partners are engaged with in a meaningful way to support the design of the new model and the service specification. It is also proposed (subject to Cabinet approval in autumn 2019), to begin trialling some new ways of working during 2020, to begin the process of moving to the new model. This will support staff to engage effectively. 17 OFFICIAL 12. CONSULTATION FINDINGS Family surv ey quotes: 1. \"Family hub sounds great, love the idea of wellbeing for the family in a one stop shop.\" 2. \"I love the idea of consolidating groups / support together. However if it means closing down Children's Centres / Groups I feel it will limit many parents. I have already had to move the Chatterbox from Chaddlewood which was walking distance to having to catch the bus. to the Ridgeway which some weeks I am unable to attend due to finances. I have noticed some weeks the groups busy and others it 's not. So I think limiting groups would restrict parents.\" 3. \"Only concern is mixing age groups - not only for baby, could be intimidating if teenagers hanging around outside centre\" 4. \"There are potential issues around the portrayal of the family hub as somewhere to seek support while Children's C entres are for the social element and for education and fun. People may only think the service is to be accessed if you have a problem while the benefits are currently universal. It is a great place to socialise for children and p arents to play and bond and become aware of other services via the centre\" 5. \"Like idea of Family Hub - Probably invite more people to come around. Perspective of current Children's Centre maybe focuses more on mums as opposed to dads\" Professional survey quotes: 1. \"It looks like a comprehensive and well thought through integrated service model and I like that the emphasis is on the wellbeing of the children and young people. Furthermore having the Targeted Team located separately from the Family Hubs to avoi d stigmatisation is a good idea.\" 2. \"Priority should depend on need but pragmatically might depend on suitable premises.\" 3. \"Develop shared understanding of different teams ' ways of working, time to formulate and understand the issues presented as opposed to b eing directed to complete a targeted piece of work.\" 4. \"When asked about their main concern a person who did not agree with the approach commented \" Not having the staff, expertise or resources to manage the increased workload.\" 5. \"Whilst I am unable to support the offer at this stage as it is unclear in the Consultation Document of the overall impact. Management must at least know the planned logistics, more detail needed.\" The key findings from the family surveys were as follows: 1. There were responses from fam ilies with children and young people in all age groups 0 -19, however, the largest number of responses were from families with pre -school children. 2. 74% of respondents liked the name Family Hubs. 3. 82% of respondents either strongly agree or agree with the di rection of the Early Help and Targeted Support offer described in the consultation. 4.

NEEDS ANALYSIS 20 OFFICIAL Early Help and Targeted Support Needs Assessment 21 OFFICIAL Author: Office of the Director of Public Health, Plymouth City Council Date: April 2019 (v1.0) This document is produced as pa rt of P lymouth 's Joint Strategic Needs Assessment. 22 OFFICIAL Document information Document status Final Author Office of the Director of Public Health Document version V1.0 Original document date April 2019 Amendment record Version Date Reason(s) for change Pages affected 1.0 Office of the Director of Public Health Plymouth City Council Windsor House Plymouth PL6 5UF queries relating to this document please contact: odph@plymouth.gov.uk Acknowledgements : We are grateful to those colleagues and partners that have contributed to this report. In particular Julie Frier and Karlina Hall \u00a9 Office of the Director of Public Health 2019 23 OFFICIAL Population forecast It is estimated that Plymouth's population will increase by over 17,500 by 2030. The largest increase will be seen in 90+ year olds (a 76.3% increase ), whilst it is estimated there will be a 2.5% reduction in the 30 -64 year old population. The under 18 population is projected to rise by 6.6% equating to an increase of approximately 3,500 under 18s in that time. Sub-national population projections b y age group, 2012 to 2030 (2014 -based) Age group 2014 2016 2020 2025 2030 % change Source: Office for National Statistics MOSAIC Mosaic is a dataset produced by Experian as a cross -channel consumer classification system designed to help users understand the demographics, lifestyles, preferences and behaviours of the UK adult population in detail. This is achieved by allocating indiv iduals and households (by postcode) into one of 15 'Groups' and 66 detailed 'Types'. Using postcode data from the 2015 GP registration database, the top three Mosaic groups in Plymouth are: 1. M Family Basics (families with limited resources who have to budg et to make ends meet) 12.7% of postcodes 2. J Rental Hubs (educated young people privately renting in urban neighbourhoods) - 12.1% of postcodes 3. L Transient Renters (single people privately renting low cost homes for the short term) - 12.0% of postcodes Life expectancy Overall life expectancy in the city (for males and females combined) continues to rise. It has risen by 3 years and 5 months since 1997 -99. Overall life expectancy in Plymouth in 2014 -16 was 80 years and 11 months. This was an increase of 1 month from 2013 -15. In comparison with England, male life expectancy has consistently been below the national average. The latest 2014 -16 data reveals male life expectancy in Plymouth is 78 years and 11 months which is 7 months lower than the England average. This gap between male life expectancy in Plymouth and England has widened from 6 months in 2001 -03. 24 OFFICIAL The latest 2014 -16 data reveals female life expectancy has increased to 82 years and 8 months and the gap between Plymouth and the England averag e has widened to 6 months. Healthy life expectancy for males in Plymouth is 2 years and 7 months lower than the England average in 2014 -16. For females it is 6 years and 1 month lower. The proportion of life spent in 'good' health and in 'disability free ' health is also significantly below the England average for both genders. There is a strong relationship between neighbourhood deprivation group and life expectancy. In other words, the more deprived the neighbourhood group, the lower the life expectanc y and vice versa. The least deprived group of the Plymouth neighbourhoods had the highest overall life expectancy in 2014 -16 (82 years and 11 months). The most deprived group of neighbourhoods had the lowest life expectancy (78 years and 2 months) in the s ame period. The gap between the deprivation groups with the highest and lowest values in 2014 -16 was 4 years and 8 months. Child health profile Looking at the 2019 child health profile produced by Public Health England the following narrative has been produc ed.

Over half of the families living in temporary accommodation are in the West locality and a third of the families are in the So uth locality. Children being removed Over the last 3 years 444 women were identified as having 902 children removed in Plymouth, the analysis below has only been produced using the 122 women who fit the Pause criteria.6 The majority of these women live in the South and West locality (approx. 80%) with most of the remaining women living in the North locality. 6 Pause works with women who have experienced - or are at risk of - repeated pregnancies that result in children needing to be removed from their care. The programme gives women the chance to pause and take control over their lives, breaking a destructive cycle that causes both them and their children deep trauma . 322 women were excluded from the cohort for the following reasons: They had only had one child removed; They were deceased; They were 40+ and hadn't had a child within the last three years; They were no longer living in Plymouth; They were currently livi ng with, and caring for, one or more children . 28 OFFICIAL Absence and exclusions Plymouth schools have a lower proportion of pupils permanently excluded compared to England, however both Plymouth and En gland have shown increases in numbers over time.

Adverse childhood experiences Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), such as being a victim of violence or neglect, or living with a household member who abuses substances or is involved in criminal activity, are associated with negative adult outcomes such as health harming behaviours, chronic conditions, and increased health care utilisation and costs. There is also significant evidence linking childhood maltreatment with poor educational outcomes.7 ACEs and health -harming behav iours are both associated with deprivation, the more deprived communities have a higher prevalence of adults experiencing 4 and more ACEs in childhood compared to the affluent communities.8 The below table shows the prevalence of ACEs in adults, from four studies that have been carried out in the UK. Across the studies just under 50% of the adult population have experienced at least one ACE while around 10% of adults have experienced 4 or more ACEs. 7 Addressing Adversity (2018), Young minds 8 Bellis et al (2014) National household survey of adverse childhood experiences and their relationship with resilience to heal th-harming behaviours in England 29 OFFICIAL 1.1 Number of ACEs 1.2 Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire and Luton9 1.3 Study4 1.5 Welsh Nationa l Study11 1.6 0 1.7 56 1.8 53 1.9 54 1.10 53 1.11 1 1.12 18 1.13 19 1.14 23 1.15 20 1.16 2-3 1.17 17 1.18 16 1.19 15 1.20 13 1.21 4+ 1.22 9 1.23 12 1.24 8 1.25 14 Pupil's resilience and self esteem When results from the local school survey are compared to other areas that have carried out a school survey is shows the following: A low proportion of pupils in Plymouth have a high self -esteem and resilience score when compared to 6 LA in Plymouths CIPFA (Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy) group, And a higher pr oportion of pupils having a low self -esteem and resilience score Method for the locality summaries To produce the following information for the localities we created 39 neighbourhood profiles (that make up the four localities) which were populated by a number of indicators which were grouped into four areas (see appendix for a full list of indicators used in the profiles).
