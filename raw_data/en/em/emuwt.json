Western Medicine has only been able to engage in palliative care when addressing this serious disorder. Yet still, there is a growing global trend and interest in natural medicine solutions to address many of the world's health problems that western medicine has failed to fully address, heal & eradicate. With the growing availability of evidence-based natural healthcare solutions, both preventative and curative, perhaps its time for the western healthcare industry to stop the cult-like fraternity behavior that is more exclusionary than inclusive, which ultimately has nothing to do with public health safety, but self-serving turf protection, and start considering these natural evidence-based solutions to address acute and chronic health disparities. This health article is designed to do just that, address health issues such as lupus using both conventional understandings along with integrative, naturopathic & oriental medicine solutions to combat this disease head-on so that the quality of life of those who suffer from this ailment is significantly improved. My top priority is not fame, fortune nor recognition, but only to find plausible solutions to bringing healing to a suffering world. D Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS) 2015 Connective tissue disease (CTD) is a group of inflammatory disorders of unknown aetiology. Patients with CTD often report hypersensitivity to nickel. We examined the frequency of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) (Type IV allergy) to metals in patients with CTD. Thirty-eight patients; 9 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 16 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 13 with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS) and a control group of 43 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were included in the study. A detailed metal exposure history was collected by questionnaire. Metal hypersensitivity was evaluated using the optimised lymphocyte transformation test LTT-MELISA(\u00ae) (Memory Lymphocyte Immuno Stimulation Assay). In all subjects, the main source of metal exposure was dental metal restorations. The majority of patients (87%) had a positive lymphocyte reaction to at least one metal and 63% reacted to two or more metals tested. Within the control group, 43% of healthy subjects reacted to one meta... 2000 BACKGROUND: Patients with certain autoimmune and allergic diseases, such as systemic lupus, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis or atopic eczema, often show increased lymphocyte stimulation by low doses of inorganic mercury in vitro. The patients often report clinical metal hypersensitivity, especially to nickel. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In this study we examined the health impact of amalgam replacement in mercury-allergic patients with Neuro endocrinology letters 2004 Patients with certain autoimmune and allergic diseases, such as systemic lupus, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis or atopic eczema, often show increased lymphocyte stimulation by low doses of inorganic mercury in vitro. The patients often report clinical metal hypersensitivity, especially to nickel. In this study we examined the health impact of amalgam replacement in mercury-allergic patients with autoimmunity. The suitability of MELISA, an optimized lymphocyte stimulation test, for the selection of susceptible patients and monitoring of sensitization was also examined. Amalgam fillings were replaced with composites and ceramic materials. Follow-up health status and lymphocyte reactivity were assessed and evaluated half a year or later following amalgam removal. Results of lymphocyte reactivity measured with MELISA indicate that in vitro reactivity after the replacement of dental amalgam decreased significantly to inorganic mercury, silver, organic mercury and lead.

Nutritional Perspectives 2006 See updated works: 2015: Human Microbiome and Dysbiosis Mastery, 4th Edition: https://www.ichnfm.org/im4 Inflammation Mastery / Functional Inflammology, Volume 1 (2014, updated and expanded in 2016). This work is the culmination of several thousand research publications combined with Dr Vasquez's many years of clinical experience and teaching graduate-level students and doctorate-level clinicians worldwide. With radiographs, photos, acronyms, illustrations, flowcharts, and detailed-yet-simplifying explanations, Dr Vasquez makes it easier than ever for clinicians to grasp important concepts in integrative care and functional medicine and then to translate the basic science research and molecular biology into treatment plans that can be explained and used in \" the real world \" of clinical practice with patients. The associated video tutorials and recorded live conference presentations further help students and clinicians \" get it \" via Dr Vasquez's effective teaching style which embraces complexity while always emphasizing clinical applicability and psychosocial context. The Inflammation Mastery & Functional Inflammation Mastery & Functional Inflammation Mastery & Functional Inflammation Mastery & Functional Inflammology series of books and videos Inflammology series of books and videos Inflammology series of books and videos Inflammology series of books and videos translates important concepts and nutritional/biomedical science into easy and practical clinical applications for the prevention and treatment of disorders of sustained inflammation, which Dr Vasquez describes as \" patterns of metabolic disturbance and inflammatory dysfunction \" existing in three sequential and overlapping categories: 1) metabolic inflammation, 2) allergic inflammation, 3) autoimmune inflammation. This book includes access to video presentations which introduce the origin and components of the Functional Inflammology Protocol and FINDSEX \u00ae acronym. Post-publication updates to this information and important social and clinical contextualization are made available in videos and online repositories (access provided in the book), and the e-newsletter available from ICHNFM.ORG. This textbook also provides access, via reprints or hyperlinks, to Dr Vasquez's published articles\u2014an example of which is his recent paradigm-shifting editorial published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine (2014 January). The updated section on pain management allows students and clinicians to understand and apply manual, pharmacologic, nutritional and botanical medicine treatments for musculoskeletal pain, thereby providing better relief for patients and avoiding the hazards of NSAIDs, coxibs, steroids, opioids, immunosuppressants and biologics.

The Science of the total environment 2010 The prevalence of allergic-related diseases, food intolerance, and chemical sensitivities in both the pediatric and adult population has increased dramatically over the last two decades, with escalating rates of associated morbidity. Conditions of acquired allergy, food intolerance and chemical hypersensitivity are frequently the direct sequelae of a toxicant induced loss of tolerance (TILT) in response to a significant initiating toxic exposure. Following the primary toxicant insult, the individuals become sensitive to low levels of diverse and unrelated triggers in their environment such as commonly encountered chemical, inhalant or food antigens. Among sensitized individuals, exposure to assorted inciting stimuli may precipitate diverse clinical and/or immune sequelae as may be evidenced by clinical symptoms as well as varied lymphocyte, antibody, or cytokine responses in some cases. Recently recognized as a mechanism of disease development, TILT and resultant sensitivity-related...
