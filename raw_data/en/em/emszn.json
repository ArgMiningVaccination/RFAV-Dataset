Understanding of the overall clinical development p lan is needed to design an appropriate and efficient noncl inical program. Early consideration of nonclinical support for paed iatric medicine development is recommended. Think about changing the design and/ or timing of the tradition al nonclinical program e.g. use of data from reproductive toxicity studies. Prior to each paediatricclinical trial: weight of e vidence (WoE) evaluation should be conducted would additional nonclinical investigations have added va lue? Section 1: General principles 9S11 - Step 2 Weight ofevidence (WoE) approach= integrated assessment Based on: \u0001Clinical context: indication, intended paediatric a ge group, treatment regimen, and ability to clinically monitor and/or manage identified safety concerns \u0001PharmacologyandPharmacokinetics (ADME) \u0001Existing nonclinical ( in vitro and in vivo data) and clinical safety data \u0001Feasibility Section 2: Determining the need for additional nonclinical safety investigations 10 S11 - Step 2 10/18/2018 6 blue: most important indicatea gradientfor theweightof eachfactor (list is not complete, can be extended as desired) Figure 1 of the Draft ICH S11 11 Application of the WoE approach Guideline recommends a customisedJAS ocore endpoints to be evaluated in all studies oadditional endpoints are added when needed to address identified safety concerns. JAS design including all additional endpoints is no t recommended without a rationale. Understanding the level of maturity and function of organ systems across species during their development is needed (see Appendix A) oTo design an appropriate JAS oFor the translation of nonclinical toxicity findings to a specific human age range Section 3: Design of JAS (I) 12 S11 - Step 2 10/18/2018 7 Dose-Range-Finding - Appendix Age of Off-treatment period: should be included to underst and persistence, progression, reversibility or delayed onset of a specific effect Route of administration Dose selection: a dose-response relationship and a no- observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) should be established Section 3: Design of JAS (II) 13 S11 - Step 2 Core endpoints: general standard for a JAS: mortality and clinical signs, growth (body weight + long bone length), food consumption, sexual development, clin ical pathology (serum chemistry and haematology), anatomic pathology (gross pathology, organ weights, major organ histopathology), and toxicokinetics Additional endpoints: driven by identified safety concerns e.g. ophthalmologic examinations, CNS and reproductive assessments, expanded histopathology Allocation of animals to study groups - rodent examples provided in Appendix C Section 3: Design of JAS (III) 14 S11 - Step 2 10/18/2018 8 Special criteria are described when drug will be administered to paediatric patients without any pri or adult data: two JAS are recommended (rodent and non - rodent) Juvenile primate study to be conducted only in exceptional cases oAlternative approaches (in vitro assays, genetically-modi fied animals, surrogate molecules) should be considered oPost-weaning juvenile NHP (9-12 months of age) when i t is the only relevant species and needed for paediatric first/on ly oPre-weaning NHP limited primarily to neonatal use wh en there are no alternatives Section 4: Paediatric-first/ Paediatric-only 15 S11 - Step 2 Excipients oSeparate studies generally not recommended, but saf ety should be assessed. Combination pharmaceuticals oConsiderations similar to those for supporting combinations in adults. oStudies of combination only or of combination in an additional arm of a study of individual drug may be sufficient if warranted.
