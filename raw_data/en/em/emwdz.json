It is a branch of engineering in which knowledge and skills are developed and applied to define and solve problems in biology and medicine. Students choose the biomedical engineering field to be of service to people, for the excitement of working with living systems, and to apply advanced technology to the complex problems of medical care. Biomedical engineers may be called upon to design instruments and devices, to bring together knowledge from many sources to develop new procedures, or to carry out research to acquire knowledge needed to solve new problems. During the last 20 years, we have witnessed unprecedented advances in engineering, medical care, and the life sciences. The combination of exploding knowledge and technology in biology, medicine, the physical sciences, and engineering, coupled with the changes in the way health care will be delivered in the next century, provide a fertile ground for biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineering, at the confluence of these fields, has played a vital role in this progress. Traditionally, engineers have been concerned with inanimate materials, devices, and systems, while life scientists have investigated biological structure and function. Biomedical engineers integrate these disciplines in a unique way, combining the methodologies of the physical sciences and engineering with the study of biological and medical problems. The collaboration between engineers, physicians, biologists, and physical scientists is an integral part of this endeavor and has produced many important discoveries in the areas of artificial organs, artificial implants, and diagnostic equipment. The Department offers a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (BME), a four-year engineering curriculum accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of [ABET](http://www.abet.org/), http://www.abet.org. This program prepares students for a wide variety of careers in Biomedical Engineering in industry, hospitals, and research laboratories or for further education in graduate school. The Department also offers a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering: Premedical (BMEP), a four-year engineering curriculum taken with required premedical courses. It is one of many majors that can serve as preparation for further training in medical, veterinary, or allied health professions. It is also suitable for students interested in pursuing graduate work in Biomedical Engineering and other biomedical areas such as physiology, neurosciences, and bioinformatics. The curriculum has less engineering content but more biological sciences and chemistry course work than the Biomedical Engineering major. The undergraduate major in Biomedical Engineering: Premedical is not designed to be accredited, therefore is not accredited by ABET. Areas of graduate study and research include biophotonics, biomedical nanoscale systems, biomedical computational technologies, and tissue engineering. Faculty Affiliate Faculty [] Courses BME 1.
