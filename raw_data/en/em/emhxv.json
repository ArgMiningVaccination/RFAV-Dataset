Part of the comprehensive assessment work is to formally identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders helped to prioritize the unmet needs for further implementation strategy development. We are grateful to all the com munity members who joined us in this important work. During 2015 members of the community were asked to complete a generalizable survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University ana lyzed the survey data. Sanford further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs, and partnered with key community stakeholders to develop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritization exercise w as also conducted to identify the most significant health needs, and to further address these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. Sanford Bemidji has set strategy to address the following community health needs: Mental Health Children and Youth The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. T he asset map/resource list is included in this docu ment along with the actions that will be taken to address each identified need. At Sanford Bemidji, patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not -for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of our communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work, we can bring health and healin g to the people who live and work in our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Bryan Nermoe Joy Johnson President Chief Operating Officer Sanford Bemidji Medical Center Sanford Bemidji Medical Center 3 Sanford Bemidji Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Sanford Bemidji Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital community benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and co mmunity health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retain ing not -for- profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a community benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Methodology 1. Generalizable Survey A generalizable survey was conducted of residents in the cities of Bemidji and Bagley, as well as Beltrami and Clearwater count ies in Minnesota. The purpose of the generalizable survey of residents in the greater Bemidji area was to learn about the percepti ons of area residents regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. Staff at the North Dakota State Univer sity Center for Social Research, along with Sanford leadership and public health leaders from North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota, including Beltrami County Public Health , created the survey tool and cover letter. Elements of informed consent were in cluded in the letter ensuring that the NDSU Institutional Review Board requirements were met and the protection of human subjects maintained. 5 Obtained through a qualified vendor, t he sample was a stratified random sample to ensure that appropriate proport ions from each of the two counties were included. A total of 1,500 records with names, addresses, and a few demographic indicators were included in the sample . A total of 405 paper surveys were returned for scanning and an additional 5 surveys were compl eted on-line for a total of 410 surveys ; the response rate was 27 percent. Respondents who did not enter a gender and age response were eliminated from the analyses. A total of 3 91 surveys were analyzed , providing a generalizable sample with a confidence level of 95 percent and an error rate of plus or minus 5 percentage points. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. N eeds ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of t he required prioritization. 2. Non -Generalizable Survey An on -line non-generalizable survey was conducted through a partnership between Sanford and Beltrami Public Health. The CSR developed and maintained links to the on-line survey tool. The website addres s for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the months of April and May 2015 and a total of 104 respondents participat ed in the on-line survey. The pur pose of this non -generalizable survey of community leade rs in the greater Bemidji area was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This gr oup included community leaders, legislators, and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. 3. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the finding from assessment research and to discuss the top health issues facing the community. Community stakeholders discussed the findings and helped to determine key priorities for the community. Those priorities will be addressed in the implementation strategies for 2017 -2019. 4. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. A multi -voting methodology was i mplemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 6 5. Secondary Research The s econdary data includes the 2015 County Health Rankings for Beltrami and Clearwater Counties. Key Findings - Primary Research The key findings are based on the generalizable and the non -generalizable survey data. Key indicators were ranked on a 1 -5 Likert scale, with 5 being the highest conce rn ranking.

Community stakeholders also rated mental illness a top priority. Children and Youth Mental Health Sanford has determined the 2017 -2019 implementation strategies for the following needs: Priority 1: Children and Youth Priority 2: Mental Health Implementation Strategies Priority 1 : Mental Health/Behavioral Health Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and socia l well -being. It affects how people think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse Family history of mental health problems Mental health p roblems are common but p eople with mental health proble ms can get better and many recover completely. Sanford has made mental/behavioral health a significant priority and has developed strateg ies to reduce mortality and morbidity from chem ical addiction and mental health disease s, recruit additional psychiatry/psychology providers for the ambulatory care setting, and enhance the level of behavioral health services that are available to patients in the hospital setting. Priority 2 : Childre n and Youth According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, p regnant teens are at higher risk of certain health problems (such as high blood pressure or anemia) than pregnant women who are older. Pregnant teens are more likely to go into labor too early. This is called preterm birth. These risks are even greater for teens who are younger than 15 years or for those who do not get prenatal care. Teen pregnancies carry extra health risks to both the mother and the baby. Often, teens don't get prenatal care soon enough, which can lead 10 to problems later on. They have a higher risk for pregnancy -related high blood pressure and its complications. Risks for the baby include premature birth and a low birth weight . Sanford has made children and youth a significant priority and has developed strateg ies to improve the health of newborns and young children, and to enhance the level of care that is available for high risk infants. Additionally, Sanford fit is an on -line community health activation initiative created by Sanford Health that provides engaging programs and resources to kids, families, leaders and role models across numerous settings to promote and activate healthy choices . The four key factors of healthy choices, a healthy body and healthy life included in fit are, MOOD - Emotions and Attitudes , RECHARGE - Sleep and Relaxation , FOOD - Mindful Nutrition Choices , and MOVE - Physical Activity Levels .+ 11 Sanford Bemidji Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 Table of Contents 12 Page Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment 13 Acknowledgements 13 Description of Sanford Bemidji Medical Center 16 Description of the Community Served 17 Study Design and Methodology 18 Limitations of the Study 20 Key Findings 21 Primary Research o Community Health Concerns o Personal Health Concerns o Demographics o Health Needs and Community Resources Identified o Prioritization How Sanford is Addressing the Needs 48 2016 Implementation Strategies 50 2013 Implementation Strategies Impact 56 Community Feedback from 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment 59 Appendix 60 Primary Research Asset Map Prioritization Worksheet Generalizable Survey Non-Generalizable Survey Secondary Research Definitions of Key Indicators / County Health Rankings Beltrami County Minnesota and C learwater County Minnesota 13 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital community benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research.

Generalizable Survey A generalizable survey was conducted of residents in Beltrami County and Clearwater County, Minnesota . The survey instrument was developed in partnership with Beltrami Public Health, members of the Greate r Fargo -Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment collaborative, Sioux Falls community collaborative, Bismarck community collaborative, public health leaders from across the enterprise, and researchers at the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dako ta State University (NDSU). The purpose of the generalizable survey of residents in the greater Bemidji and Bagley area (i.e., Beltrami County and Clearwater County ) was to learn about the percepti ons of area residents regarding community health, their per sonal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. Staff at the CSR, along with members of the collaborative, created the cover letter. Elements of informed consent were included in the letter ensuring that the NDSU Institutional Review Board requirements were met and the protection of human subjects maintained. The survey instrument was designed as a scannable 8 -page mail survey containing 5 4 questions. The questions focused on general community concerns, community health and wellness concer ns, personal health, preventive health, and demographic characteristics. Obtained through a qualified vendor, t he sample was a stratified random sample to ensure that appropriate proportions from each of the two counties were included. A total of 1,500 records with names, addresses, and a few demographic indicators were included in the sample . Residents listed in the sample were first mailed an introductory postcard briefly explaining the project and notifying them that a survey packet would be arrivi ng in their mail. Surveys packets, which contained the cover letter, scannable paper survey , and a pre-paid return envelope, were mailed three days af ter the introductory postcards. Two percent of the packets were returned as undeliverable. A reminder post card, containing a link to an on-line version of the survey, was mailed to non -responders approximately 10 days after the initial survey was mailed. A total of 39 8 paper surveys were returned for scanning and an additional 3 surveys were completed on-line for a total of 401; the response rate was 27 %. It was apparent that elderly and male respondents were overrepresented in the scanned results. Therefore, post - stratification weight s were used to ensure proper representation of the population with respect t o age and gender. Respondents who did not enter a gender and age response were eliminated from the analyses. A total of 3 91 surveys were analyzed , providing a generalizable sample with a confidence level of 95 % and an error rate of plus or minus 5 percenta ge points. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs t hat ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 19 2. Non -Generalizable Survey A non -generalizable survey was conducted of residents in Beltrami County and Clearwater County, Minnesota . The survey instrument was developed in partnership with Beltrami Public Health, members of the Greater Fargo -Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment collaborative, Sioux Falls community collaborative, Bismar ck community collaborative, public health leaders from across the enterprise, and researchers at the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University (NDSU). The CSR developed and maintained links to the on-line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the months of April and May 2015 and a total of 104 respondents participat ed in the on-line survey. The purpose of the non-generalizable sur vey of residents in the greater Bemidji and Bagley area (i.e., Beltrami County and Clearwater County ) was to learn about the percepti ons of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, pr eventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders and agency leaders representing public health, city government, Bemidji State University, law enfor cement, chamber, tribes, chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 3. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early finding from the generalizable survey and to discuss the top health issues or health related issues facing the community. The community stakeholder s helped to determine key priorities for the community. 4. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the comm unity to address the needs. The community stakeholder group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what need s remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. A multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed in to implementation strategies. 5. Secondary Research The secondary data includes County Health Rankings for Beltrami and Clearwater counties. 20 Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and pe rcept ions of residents living in Beltrami and Clearwater County , Minnesota. However, when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, income, minority status) with the current population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, it was evident t hat older, white, more highly educated, and higher income earners were overrepresented. Overrepresentation of this nature is typical in health needs assessments. Literature reviews indicate that there are non -response rate issues among younger respondent s. In particular, response rates to health care and community health needs assessment surveys have often been found to be higher for older respondents. Studies have also shown lower response rates for socially disadvantaged groups (i.e., socially, cultural ly, or financially). A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. The generalizable survey was mailed to a representative group of the area to assure input from all demographics. Additionally, invitations were extended to county and community leaders, organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. Additional data was reviewed through secondary research. The data for the secondary research was secured from the County Health Rankings . The Internal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broa d interests of the community served by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leaders, representatives, or members of medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cas es there were surveys that were submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs ass essment and the implementations strategies are welcome on the Sanford website under \"About Sanford\" in the Community Health Needs Assessment section. 21 Key Findings 22 Primary Research Community Health Concerns The following concerns ranked highest of all the indicators on the generalizable and the non -generalizable (community stakeholders) surveys. Economics: The availability of affordable housing ranks highest of concerns among community stakeholders. Homelessness and hunger also rank as high concerns among community stakeholders. The generalizable group which is representative of the community did not rank these indicators as top concerns and they did not rank over 3.5. There was moderate concern for these three indicators among the non- generalizable group. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding ECONOMICS Sanford is providing affordable HUD housing to seniors in the community. The faith community has an active collaborative that addresses homeless ness and hunger in the community. A gap exists for affordable housing, homelessness and hunger in the community and surrounding area. Transportation: The availability of public transportation is a concern of the community stakeholders.

Aging Population: The cost and availability of long term care is the highest concern for both the communi ty stakeholders and t he generalizable group. The availability of memory care is a concern for both groups. Additionally th ere are high concerns about the availability of resources to help caregivers making decisions for their elders, the availability of resources to help the elderly stay in their homes and the availability of resources for grandparents caring for grandchildre n. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding the AGING POPULATION Sanford is working collaboratively with the area aging service providers to coordinate care for the aging population. Social workers, case manager s, and discharge planners are working collaboratively with area service providers to assure safe discharge, and when appropriate , to assist in transitions from levels of care. Children and Youth: The community stakeholders and the generalizable survey respondents have ve ry high concerns for the children and youth of the community. Teen pregnancy is the highest of concerns, followed by the availability of services for at -risk youth. Every indicator in the children and youth category is a high concern for the community stak eholders. 3.08 3.21 3.47 3.51 3.54 3.64 3.67 3.71 3.53 4 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5Cost of activities for seniorsAvailability of activities for seniorsAvailability of resources for grandparents caring for grandchildrenAvailability of resources to help the elderly stay safe in their homesAvailability of memory careAvailability of resources for family/friends caring for and making decisions for eldersAvailability of long term careCost of long term care Non-Generalizable Generalizable24 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding CHILDREN AND YOUTH Bemidji has developed a community collaborative, Growing Bemidji, to develop community -based solutions to improve the health and well -being of youth in the Bemidji region. Safety: Safety was the highest of concerns for the respondents of the non -generalizable survey and also ranked very high for the generalizable survey. The presence of street drugs, prescription drugs, and alcohol and drug dealers in the community are the top concerns. Child abuse and neglect, crime and domestic violence, the presence of gang activity, elder abuse and sex trafficking are all concerns that rank high among the survey respondents. 3.18 3.35 3.37 3.44 3.48 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5School absenteeismCost of services for at-risk youthSchool dropout ratesAvailability of services for at-risk youthCost of activities for children and youthTeen pregnancyCost of quality infant careAvailability of quality child careAvailability of quality infant care (birth to 2 years)Availability of activities for children and youthCost of quality child careBullyingYouth crime Non-Generalizable Generalizable25 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding SAFETY Sanford has developed a nd trained a security force that works together with law enforcement to assure a safe environment on the medical center campus. Sanford provides financial support to the area agency that serves sexual ly assaulted women and children. Health Care Access : Community stakeholders ranked the use of the emergency department for primary care as the top concern in the access category. The generalizable respo ndents ranked the cost of affordable health care as the top concern. Community stakeholder s ranked timely access to mental health provide rs as the second highest concern and the generalizable respondents ranked access to affordable health insurance as thei r second top concern. The results of the survey indicate that it is timely access to services that rank s high among the community stakeholders and it is the access to affordable health care , prescription drugs, and the cost of health, dental and vision ins urance that are the top concerns for the generalizable respondents. 3.20 3.52 3.73 3.95 3.96 4.04 4.04 4.07 3.62 3.63 4.04 4.13 4.41 4.52 4.15 4.23 0.00 traffickingElder abusePresence of gang activityDomestic violencePresence of drug dealers in the communityPresence of street drugs, prescription drugs, and alcohol in the communityCrimeChild abuse and neglect Non-Generalizable Generalizable26 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding HEALTH CARE 1.89 2.31 2.41 2.65 2.79 2.83 3.6 3.49 3.62 4.14 3.64 3.71 3.77 3.75 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5Timely access to bilingual providers and/or translatorsTimely access to exercise specialists or personal trainersTimely access to registered dietitiansTimely access to transportationTimely access to vision care providersTimely access to prevention programs and servicesTimely access to dental care providersDistance to health care servicesTimely access to substance abuse providersAvailability of transportationTimely access to mental health providersCoordination of care between providers and servicesAvailability of non-traditional hours (e.g., evenings, weekends)Providers not taking new patientsTimely access to physician specialistsTimely access to doctors, physician assistants, or nurse practitionersCost of affordable vision insuranceUse of emergency room services for primary health careCost of affordable dental insurance coverageAccess to affordable prescription drugsAccess to affordable health insuranceAccess to affordable health care Non-Generalizable Generalizable27 Bemidji has unique services that address access. The Northern Dental Access Clinic is a strong model that provides dental care, social services and referral , a medical legal partnership, and outreach to local schools. Sanford makes referrals to the Northern Dental Access Clinic for those who have access challenges. The community of Bemidji has many stron g collaborative groups that work diligently to address the needs of the community. Sanford is addressing the utilization of the emergency department f or primary care by connecting patients to primary care providers. Walk -in clinic hours are expanding to o ffer alternatives to the overuse of the emergency department. Prescription drugs are made available at a free or reduce d rate for patients who are unable to pay. Sanford Bemidji offers charity care to patients unable to pay for medical treatment. Sanford's community care policy defines qualifications and financial counselors are available to assist patients who qualify for free or subsidized care. Financial counselors also assist with enrollment for patients who qualify for public programs. Sanford employs a financial counselor in the onc ology program to assist uni nsured and underinsured cancer patie nts with applications fo r reduced rates or community care for chemotherapy medications. Sanford is expanding mental health services in primary care clinics and at the medical center to offer psychiatric Telehealth services. Sanford is working collaboratively with Beltrami County , Upper Mississippi Mental Health Center and several other community agencies to develop a county -wide continuum of care. Social workers, case managers and discharge planners work collaboratively with area service providers to assure that safe discharges and possible and appropriate resources are engaged. Finally, Sanford is promoting video and on-line visits 24/7 for health plan members. 28 Physical Health: The top physical health concern among the community stakeholders is poor nutri tion, followed by obe sity and inactivity. Chronic disease and cancer are also high ranking concerns among this group. The respondents to the generalizable survey rank cancer as their highest concern, followed by inactivity and obesity, poor nutrition and chronic disease. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH Sanford offers exercise programming for employees, patients and elderly patients on site. Nutrition counseling and obesity management programs are expanding to meet the assessed need. Sanford partners with a local radio station to offer a summer walking program for the community. Each week the event includes a registration (without fee), a short presentation by local physicians and health care providers, door prizes and a two-mile walk led by a Sanford wellness specialist. Sanford staff members monitor the course and make certain that everyone finishes the walk safely.

The new center will provide integrated and comprehensive cancer services all under one roof . Sanford offers a comprehensive diabetes education program. Sanford diabetes clinics and centers are dedicated to empowering people with diabetes to feel better and pre vent long -term complications. Sanford offer s assessment, and personalized education to give patients and their families the tools they need to manage diabetes while living well. Endocrinologists, certified diabetes nurses , and certified diabetes dieticians provide diagnosis, assessment, one -on-one education and instruction. We are here to support you every step of the way, at every age. The chronic disease self -manag ement Better Choices, Better Health Program at Sanford is offered free of charge to community members. Better Choices, Better Health is modeled after the Stanford University's chronic disease self-management program. The workshops are 2 \u00bd hours long and me et weekly for 6 weeks. The program is facilitated by two trained lay leaders, and one or both of them have chronic condition themselves . Research has found that after participating in the program individuals are better able to manage their symptoms, commun icate more easily with their doctors, are less limited by the disease, and generally feel better. The Sanford Health fit initiative, http://sanfordfit.org/ a childhood obesity prevention initiative, continues to grow and mature as we work to refine the offerings and enable broad replication and meaningful use. Supported by the clinical experts of Sanford Health, fit educates, empowers and motivates families to live a healthy lifestyle through a comprehensive suite of resources for kids, parents, teachers and clinicians. fit is the only initiative focusing equally on the four key contributing factors to childhood obesity: Food (nutrition), Move (activity), Mood (behavioral health), and Recharge (sleep). Sanford's fit Initiative has come a long way since its inception in 2010. Through fit we are actively working to promote healthy lifestyles in homes, schools, daycares, our clinical settings, and throughout the community by way of technology, engaging programs, and util izing key role models in a child's life. The fit website for Juniors, Kids and Teens creates an entertaining and interactive on-line environment where they can play games, watch videos and take daily challenges. Parents benefit from their own set of resources where they can find tips and tools on becoming healthy role models and raising fit kids. To date, the children's and parent's sites have received more than 7.5 million visitors. Over 700 pieces of content have been added to the sites , including videos, slideshows, games, articles, and even fit songs . In addition to the web, fit is developing meaningful school resources to bring value and fun into the primary education setting. We are doing this by integrating fit points into s cience and math components to provide health promotion, an avenue into the classroom without taking valuable time away from those critical subjects. fit4Schools - fit4Schools includes unique fit-based lessons integrated into daily classroom activities . fit4schools.sanfordfit.org is an on -line school resource that incorporates topics into math and science curriculum. To date the program has 14 STEM (integrating science, technology, engineering, and math) unit plans that can be downloaded for classroom us e. To date it has: o Reached 50,000 schools o 180,000 page views from educators across the country o 12,000 lesson plan downloads, representing 600,000+ students 30 We are also reaching thousands of students through several pilot school programs. o fit4Schools - fit4Schools, which includes unique fit-based lessons integrated into daily classroom activities, is in its final phase of development. It is being piloted in seven elementary schools in the Sanford region. Community o The fit friends, Denny, Abby, Sam, Alex and Marty, along with the fit team, have been making a variety of appearances at events across the Sanford footprint . fit has been at over 2 dozen events interacting with more than 15,000 children and parents to spread the wo rd about the fit platform and resources. o Smartphone Apps - Through a series of fun and engaging apps, fit will continue to activate kids at the touch of a fingertip to live a fit and healthy lifestyle related to M ood, Recharge, Food and Move. o MOVE2Draw is a simple and fun way for kids to move and create their own unique drawings. Once a drawing is completed, it can be stored on the MOVE2Draw website. o eMOODicam is a photo application that allows the user to enhance a photo and bring the mood to life and shar e with others. Looking Forward o fit is continuing to look to the future for ways to continue to make a meaningful impact on children and families both on -line and off -line. Other exciting expansions that are in the works include: Clinical Setting - Resources for the clinical setting to spur actionable and understandable discussions between health care providers and families. Health Coaches - Exploring meaningful ways for health coaches to promote healthy choices with children and adults . Engage Key Ro le Models - Firefighters and youth sport coaches are role models and have a big influence on children so that's why fit is developing resources for them to teach the principles of fit along with sports fundamentals and other outreach efforts. fitClub 4 Bo ys - 10-week after school program for boys, ages 8 -12, to develop knowledge of fit principles and healthy behavior choices. fit Parent/child - Class for parents and children to understand healthy choices and the benefit s of living a healthy lifestyle. Men tal Health /Behavioral Health: The top behavioral health concerns are drug use and abuse, alcohol use and abuse, underage drug use and abuse and underage alcohol use and abuse for the community stakeholders. Among the generalizable respondents , underage drug use and abuse followed by drug use and abuse ( adults) and underage alcohol use and abuse are top concerns . Suicide, depression, stress, and other psychiatric diagnosis are the top mental health concerns for both groups. Dementia and Alzheimer's are also of high concern. 31 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE Sanford is working collaboratively with Beltrami County, the Upper Mississippi Mental Health Center , and several other community agencies to develop a county -wide continuum of care to meet the behavioral health needs of the county. Programming will include acute and crisis needs, detoxification, community -based care options , as well as support programs. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5Exposure to second-hand smokeSmoking and tobacco useUnderage drinkingAlcohol use and use and abuseUnderage drug use and abuse Non-Generalizable Generalizable32 Personal Health Concerns Resp ondents ' Personal Health Status The study results suggest possible discrepancies between respondents' perceived personal health and their actual health status as determined by objective measures. For example, using the Body Mass Index (BMI) which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height , the majority of respondents in the area are overweight or obese. Howev er, the vast majority of community respondents rate their own health as excellent, very good, or good. With good overall health habits in mind, it is important to note that with in the past year, 70% of respondents visited a doctor or health care provider f or a routine physical and over 71% visited a dentist or dental clinic. Respondents' rating of their health in general 93.1% of the community stakeholders ( non-generalizable) and 84.1% of the generalizable group rate their health as good or better Respondents' weight status based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale 0 2.2 13.7 30.2 43.2 10.7 0 0 6.9 28.4 52.9 11.8 0 10 20 30 40 50 60Don't knowPoorFairGoodVery (BMI less than 18.5) Non-Generalizable Generalizable33 65.6% of the key stakeholders and 70.6% of the generalizable respondents report a BMI that is overweight or obese . Length of time since respondents last visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical exam and length of time since they last visited a dentist or dental clinic for any reason Non Generalizable Generalizable Preventive Health Prevent ive health care promotes the detection and pr evention of illness and disease and is another important component of good health and well-being . Community results indicate that within the past year, the majority of respondents had a blood pressure screening, blood sugar screening, cholester ol screening, and dental screening. Flu shot s and pelvic exam (females) were higher among the community stakeholder group than the generalizable group. Breast cancer screening (females) was lower among the community stakeholders than the generalizable group. Over 44% of the generalizable group had not had a cervical cancer screening in the past year. There are many screenings and tests that a majority of respondents did not receive (i.e., bone density test, cardio screening, glaucoma test, hearing screening, immunizations, STD test, vascular screening, colorectal cancer screening, prostate cancer screen ing [males ], and skin cancer screening) in the past year. Many tests and screenings may be conditional upon guidelines, which can be age sensitive/appropriate. 0.1 1.9 3.7 9.7 12.9 71.8 2.7 1.0 7.8 4.1 14.7 69.6 0 20 40 60 80 100NeverDon't know6 or more years3 to 5 years1 to 2 yearsWithin the past year Percent* Doctor or health care provider (N=390) Dentist or dental clinic (N=386)0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 20.4 76.5 0.0 1.0 2.0 7.1 18.4 71.4 020 40 60 80100NeverDon't know6 or more years3 to 5 years1 to 2 yearsWithin the past year Percent* Doctor or health care provider (N=98) Dentist or dental clinic (N=98)34 Whether or not respondents have had preventive screenings in the past year, by type of scree ning Type of screening Yes Generalizable Yes Non -Generalizable No Generalizable No Non -Generalizable GENERAL SCREENINGS Blood pressure screening (N=380) 83 87.9 17 12.1 Blood sugar screening (N=379) 64.7 60.6 35.3 39.4 Bone density test (N=367) 9.1 9.2 90.9 98.8 Cardiovascular screening (N=373) 31.5 23.5 68.5 76.5 Cholesterol screening (N=378) 66.3 82.7 21.6 17.3 Flu shot (N=380) 42.4 26 Glaucoma test (N=374) 41.6 40.4 58.4 59.6 Hearing screening (N=377) 22 5.1 78 94.9 Immunizations (tetanus, hepatitis A or B) (N=374) 17.9 33.3 82.1 66.7 Pelvic exam (N=189 90.8 90.7 CANCER SCREENINGS Breast cancer screening (N= 189 Females) 69.8 44.7 30.2 55.3 Cervical cancer screening (N=185 Females) 55.3 67.5 44.7 32.5 Colorectal cancer screening (N=368) 21.6 64.4 78.4 Prostate cancer screening (N=182 Males) 46.3 50 53.7 50 Skin cancer screening (N=365) 19.2 13.5 80.8 86.5 For most types of screenings, the most common reasons for not getting the test or procedure are that it is not necessary and the doctor has not suggested one.

Breast cancer screening: According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), a mammogram is an X -ray of the breast. Mammograms are t he best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be sure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to get a screening mammogram. Cervical cancer screening: Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and follow -up. Two screening tests can help prevent c ervical cancer or find it early: The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. The Pap test is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. The HPV test looks for the human p apillomavirus ( http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/ ) that can cause these cell changes. 36 Colorectal cancer screening: Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using high - sensitivity fecal occult blood testing , sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Prostate cancer screening: The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have received this information. The discussion about screening should take place a t: Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years. Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African Americans and men who have a first -degree relative (father, brot her, or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first -degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, the screening decision can be made by the health care provider, who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between fu ture screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test: Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10 -year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit. Overall health status, and not age alone is important when mak ing decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the discussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information about the benefits and risks of testing becomes available. Further discussions are al so needed to take into account changes in the patient's health, values and preferences. Skin cancer screening: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: Be aware that fair -skinned men and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 mo les, are at greater risk for melanoma. Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical examinations for other reasons. 37 Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that everyone six mont hs and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the generalizable survey indicate that 37% of respondents did not have a flu shot last year. The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalizat ion and sometimes even death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu and spread it to others. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the vir uses that are in the vaccine. Sanford Health e mployees are required to have an annual flu vaccine as a protective measure for our patients as well as our staff. Sanford holds annual flu blitz events to increase the number of community members both pediatr ic and adult who receive the flu vaccine. Fruit and Vegetable Intake The study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet vegetable and fruit recommended dietary guidelines. Only 30.9 % of respondents in the generalizable group reported having 3 or more servings of ve getables the prior day ; however , 50.6 % in the non -generalizable group reported having 3 or more vegetables each day. Only 20.5 % of the generalizable group reported having 3 or more servings o f fruits the prior day, and 16.9 % in the non -generalizable group. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, US Department of Agriculture - Dietary guidelines for Americans, it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age. A meal plan high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them a s part of a reduced -calorie meal plan can be beneficial for weight management. 38 Number of servings of vegetables, fruit, and fruit juice that respondents had yesterday Generalizable Non -Generalizable Physical Activity Levels Study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet physical activity guidelines. In the generalizable group, 49.3 % of respondents engage in moderate activity 3 or more times per week and 22.7 % engage in vigorous activity 3 or more times per week. In the non -generalizable group, 45.6 % engage in moderate activity 3 or more times per week and 21.7 % in vigorous activity 3 or more times per week.

Mental health influences our physical health, how we handle stress , how we make choices, and how we relate to others. Among Beltrami and Cl earwater respondents, m ental health is a moderately high area of concern, particularly suicide, depression, stress, other psychiatric diagnosis, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 1 in 5 respondents have been told or diagnosed by a doctor or heal th professional that they have anxiety or stress and 17% have been told they have depression. In addition, half of respondents self -report that in the last month, there were days when their mental health was not good. 49.5% of the generalizable respondents reported days in the past month when their mental health was not good. 14.9 % reported over 7 days 55.6 % of the non-generalizable respondents reported days in the past month when their mental health was not good, and 11% reported having over 7 days in the past month when their health was not good. Number of days in the last month that respondents' mental health was not good Substance Abuse Responses Substance abuse is also a mental health disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition (DSM -IV), and can stem from mental health concerns. In the Beltrami and Clearwater counties, 89% of the community stakeholders and 70.9% of the generalizable respondents drank alco holic beverages on at least one of the day s in the last mon th. On days they drank, 20.2% of resp ondents in the community stakeholder group, and 37.1% of the generalizable respondents drank an average of 3 or more drinks per day. In regards to binge drinking, 28.5% of community stakeholders report binge drinking at least once per month , and 34.5% of the generalizable respondents report binge drinking at least once p er month . Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Ranking indicates that 23% of Beltrami County and 21 % of Clearwater County residents report excessive drinking.

The unemployment rate in Beltrami County, Minnesota is 6.6% and the unemployment level in Clearwater County is 11.2 %. Health Needs and Community Resources Identified One of the Internal Revenue Service requirements for a community health needs assessment is to identify the resources that are available in the community to address unmet needs. Sanford Health conducted a sset mapping by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and d ata sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources are available in the community to address the needs. Sanford Health and community partners developed the asset map. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what need s remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. The a sset map process includes identified needs from the following: The generalizable survey The non -generalizable survey Concerns expressed by the key stakeholder group Secondary research data Community resources that are available to address the need(s) See asset map in the Appendix . Prioritization The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Economics - affordable housing Transportation - availability of public transportation Aging - cost and availability of long term care and availability of memory care , availability of resources for caregivers and also to help seniors stay in their homes, and finally the understanding of advanced care directives Children and Youth - teen pregnancy, youth crime, cost and availability of quality child care and quality infant care, bullying , availability of services for at -risk youth, school dropout rates, and school absenteeism 47 Safety - child abuse and neglect, crime, presence of drug dealers and street drugs and alcohol in the community , domestic violence, presence of gang a ctivity, elder abuse, safe places for outdoor youth activities, sex trafficking Health Care Access - access to affordable health care and affordable health , dental and vision insurance , access to affordable prescription drugs, timely access to mental healt h providers and physician specialists, available non -traditional hours, use of emergency services for primary care, and coordination of care Physical Health - cancer, obesity, poor nutrition and inactivity Mental Health - depression, suicide, stress, under age substance use and abuse and alcohol use, adult drug use and abuse and alcohol use, other psychiatric diagnosis, dementia and Alzheimer's, smoking and tobacco use Preventive Health - flu vaccines Sanford is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. In some cases the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequately address the need. H owever , Sanford leaders will communicate these findings to community leaders and experts who can best focus on a solution to the concern. A document that shares what Sanford is doing to address the need or defends why Sanford is not addressing the need can be found in the Appendix . Members of the collaborat ive determined that children and youth and mental health are top unmet need s for further implementation strategies. Sanford has determined the 2016 -2019 implementation strategies for the following needs: Children and youth Mental Health 48 How Sanford is Addressing the Needs Identified Concerns How Sanford Bemidji is Addressing the Needs Economics Availability of affordable housing SBMC is continuing to provide affordable HUD housing to seniors.

SBMC has identified Mental Health/Behavioral Health as an implementation strategy for 2017 -2019. Preventive Health Flu shots Offer ing flu shots for all volunteers and staff at no cost. Expan ded access to flu shots at retail pharmacy sites. 50 2016 Implementation Strategy 51 Sanford Bemidji Medical Center Implementation Strategies Priority 1 : Mental Health/Behavioral Health Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and socia l well -being. It affects how people think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse Family history of mental health problems Mental health problems are common but people with mental health proble ms can get better and many recover completely. Sanford has prioritized mental/behavioral health as a top priority and has set strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity from chemical a ddiction and menta l illness , recruit additional psychiatry/psychology providers for the ambulatory care setting, and enhance the level of behavioral health services that are available to patients in the hospital setting. Priority 2 : Children and Youth According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, p regnant teens are at higher risk of certain health problems (such as high blood pressure or anemia) than pregnant women who are older. Pregnant teens are more likely to go into labor t oo early. This is called preterm birth. These risks are even greater for teens who are younger than 15 years or for those who do not get prenatal care. Teen pregnancies carry extra health risks to both the mother and the baby. Often, teens don't get prenat al care soon enough, which can lead to problems later on. They have a higher risk for pregnancy -related high blood pressure and its complications. Risks for the baby incl ude premature birth and a low birth weight . Sanford has prioritized children and youth as a top priority and has set strategy to improve the health of newborns and young children, and to enhance the level of care that is available for high risk infants. Additionally, Sanford fit is an online community health activation initiative created by Sanford Health that provi des engaging programs and resources to kids, families, leaders and role models across 52 numerous settings to promote and activate healthy choices. The four key factors of healthy choices, a healthy body and healthy life included in fit are, MOOD - Emotions a nd Attitudes , RECHARGE - Sleep and Relaxation , FOOD - Mindful Nutrition Choices , and MOVE - Physical Activity Levels . Sanford fit programs and resources have been enhanced for a number of settings to captivate, educate and activate leaders, influencers and kids to understand what healthy choices are, what they can do and to encourage them to put them in practice. These programs and resources are created for: schools, daycares, after -school, home, community events, on the go a nd more. www.Sanfordfit.org 53 Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Strategy for Sanford Bemidji Medical Center FY 2017 -2020 Action Plan Priority 1 : Behavioral Health Projected Impact : Reduce mortality and morbidity from chemical addiction and mental health disease Goal 1 : Participate in the planning for development of a community -based continuum of behavioral health services Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Dedicated Resources Leadership Note any community partnershi ps and collaborations (if applicable) A community partnership is developed for the purpose of planning a \"no wrong door \" approach to community behavioral health services A process is developed for referrals to behavioral health services ER Case Manager, High risk Case Manager, Peer Support Advocate, Behavioral Health Triage Therapist Joy Johnson Upper Mississippi Mental Health Center, Beltrami County Health and Human Services Gaps are being identified in the continuum of behavioral health services in the region Existence of a broad scope of outpatient residential & acute behavioral health services for individuals at var ious stages of mental illness Joy Johnson Upper Missis sippi MHC, Sanford TRF Behavioral Health, Beltrami County Goal 2 : Offer psychiatry and psychology services in the ambulatory setting Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Resources Leadership Note any community partnerships and collaborations - if applicable Recruit additional providers to Sanford Bemidji Clinic Number of added providers Celia Beck, Bill Stoner Bill Stoner Work with existing community providers, CBHH and Horizon Health Expand availability to telemedicine psychiatry within the hospital and clinic Additional hours of psychiatry coverage for mental health patients Psychiatrist Joy Johnson Sanford Thief River Falls Behavioral Health 54 Goal 3 : Enhance the level of behavioral health services available to patie nts hospitalized at SBMC Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Resources Leadership Note any community partnerships and collaborations - if applicable Hire or contract behavioral health experts to provide early assessment Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment and transfer Assessment resources Joy Johnson Priority 2 : Children and Youth Projected Impact : Improved health of newborns and young children Goal 1 : Reduce the number of infants born addicted to opioids Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Resources Leadership Note any community partnerships and collaborations - if applicable Develop case management resources to work with women who are pregnant or at risk of pregnancy and are opioid users Women assigned a case manager First Steps to Healthy Babies (Prime West grant) Lisa Johnson Work with County and tribes Coordinat e Medical Assisted Therapy options available for pregnant women Pregnant women receiving MAT Community CD providers Lisa Johnson Working with Upper Mississippi Mental Health Center on chemical dependency program development 55 Goal 2 : Enhance the level of care available for high risk infants born in Sanford Bemidji Medical Center Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Resources Leadership Note any community partnerships and collaborations - if applicable Develop gap analysis for establishing a Level II NICU Completed analysis Staff time OB/peds manager & pediatricians Educate staff to assure clinical competency for Level II care Hours of training provided Staff time OB/peds manager pediatricians Develop other support services needed to obtain Level II NIC U Availability of support programs such as therapies, nutrition, ventilator management, etc. Capital and staff time OB/peds manager, pharmacy, therapy Goal 3 : Improve the availability for programs for youth across the community Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Resources Leadership Note any community partnerships and collaborations - if applicable Provide Sanford fit Program to the local schools and communicate the sanfordfit.org website broadly to patients and community groups Sanford fit is available to all students and families in the area through classroom and fit website Sanford fit leadership Sanford leaders Local schools and classroom teachers Child care leaders 56 2013 Implementation Strategy Impact 57 Demonstrating Impact The 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment served as a catalyst to lift up obesity and mental health services as implementation strategies for the 2013 -2016 timespan. The following strategies were implemented. 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment Be midji Implementation Strategy 1. Implementation Strategy: Mental Health Services Three -Year Plan (January 2012 - January 2015) Completion of full integration of behavioral health services or access to behavioral health outreach in all regional clinic sites in the Bemidji region Complete presentation of outcomes of first three years of integrated behavioral health services Implement integrated behavioral health into new clinics Completion of American Indian Behavioral Health Service serving the Bemi dji region Develop behavioral health programming for hospital patients, particularly in the emergency, medical and intensive care units, in collaboration with existing community -based behavioral health providers. 2. Implementation Strategy: Obesity Three -Year Plan (January 2012 - January 2015) Develop a comprehensive weight management program within the Bemidji region using an interdisciplinary team inclusive of medical, nutrition, behavioral health and fitness professionals, as well as weight loss surge ry services. Implement Sanford Frontiers weight management program within the Bemidji Region. Actively participate with community wellness, fitness and health y living entities to promote and support fitness and active living by sponsoring walking, scre ening and educational programs. 58 The 2013 strategies have served a broad reach across our community and region. The impact has been positive and the work will continue into the future through new or continued programming and services. Impact of the Strategy to Address Mental Health Services Behavioral health services have been integrated into all primary care settings through behavioral health screening, PHQ -9 screening and two behavioral health triage therapists. Additionally, a peer support advocate was added to assist those with chemical addition in accessing desired interventions. A grant was also awarded to Sanford Bemidji Medical Center to, with the assistance of case managers, create prevention and early intervention strate gies for pregnant women who are opioid users. The impact of this grant has been to develop collaborative relationships with the Red Lake tribe and Beltrami County to help identify and intervene in order to minimize the impact on newborns. Additional recr uitment of psychology/psychiatry staff is in process. In advance of successful recruitment , telemedicine psych services are now offered to hospital and clinic patients. Mental health services for the elderly were improved at Sanford Bemidji Senior Behavi oral Health Unit with the addition of social work , activities service s, and added mental health specialists. An additional impact is the addition of high -risk case managers and emergency department care managers to assist with the identification and refer ral of high -risk patients. Impact of the Strategy to Address Obesity Sanford Bemidji Medical Center has developed a medical weight loss program inclusive of medical oversight, nutrition counseling, psychological counseling and exercise programming. The interdisciplinary program includes bariatric surgery for those who need surgical intervention. An intensive behavioral management program with intense nutritional counseling was added to serve Medicare patients. The Sanford Health fit initiative, a child hood obesity prevention initiative, continues to grow and mature as we work to refine the offerings and enable broad replication and meaningful use. Supported by the clinical experts of Sanford Health, fit educates, empowers and motivates families to live a healthy lifestyle through a comprehensive suite of resources for kids, parents, teachers and clinicians. fit is the only initiative focusing equally on the four key contributing factors to childhood obesity: Food (nutrition), Move (activity), Mood (beha vioral health), and Recharge (sleep). Through fit we are actively working to promote healthy lifestyles in homes, schools, daycares, our clinical settings, and throughout the community by way of technology, engaging programs, and utilizing key role models in a child's life. In 2016 a new fit initiative w ill be available for 20,000 classroom teachers. The classroom curriculum has numerous modules that teachers can access and implement in part or comprehensively. 59 Profile by Sanford is a personalized retail weight loss program designed by Sanford Health ph ysicians and scientists to be simple, effective and sustainable . With a certified Profile coach, personalized meal plans and smart technology to track progress, members see real results. Each weight loss plan is designed with a focus on nutrition, activity and lifestyle . The enterprise obesity initiative addressed education for providers and education for patients and community members. The first annual Sanford obesity symposium was held in 2014. Over 400 health care professionals from the region and bey ond registered for the 2014 and the 2015 symposium. The purpose of the symposium is to enhance the knowledge and competence of participants by providing an update on the latest research associated with the prevention, treatment and management of obesity. The target audience includes primary care physicians, pediatricians and specialty care providers, advanced practice providers, licensed registered dietitians, nurses, and other interested health care professionals. The symposium is an opportunity to pro vide prevention and treatment practice guidelines for the adult and pediatric population. The planning committee includes several published providers who are sought after nationally and internationally for their expertise. Sanford is taking a comprehensive and multi -faceted approach to obesity prevention and treatment. The impact is demonstrated through the lives of our community members who have had positive outcomes because of our programs and services. Community Feedback from the 2013 Com munity Health Needs Assessment Sanford Health is prepared to accept feedback on the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment and has provided on-line comment fields for ease of access on our website. There have been no comments to date aside from a question asked about the service area for this report. A reader wanted to know if a separate report was developed for the Lisbon, North Dakota area. Sinc e there is no hospital in Lisbon a community health needs assessment was not conducted solely for that community. 60 APPENDIX 61 Primary Research 62 Bemidji 2016 CHNA Asset Map Identified concern Generalizable Survey Specific areas of concern 391 surveys Non -Generalizable Survey specific areas of concern 104 surveys Key stakeholder Focus group Specific areas of concern Secondary Data Report Community resources that are available to address the need Gap?

Additio nal comments from respondents 86 The purpose of this generalizable survey of residents in the greater Bemidji area (i.e., Beltrami and Clearwater counties in Minnesota ) was to learn about the percepti ons of area residents regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. Study Design and Methodology A generalizable survey w as conducted of residents in Beltrami and Clearwater counties in Minnesota . The survey instrument was developed in partnership with members of the Greater Bemidji Community Health Needs Assessment collaborative and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. Staff at the CSR, along with members of the collaborative, created the cover letter. Elements of informed consent were included in the letter ensuring that the NDSU Institutional Review Board requirements were met and the p rotection of human subjects maintained. The survey instrument was designed as a scannable 8 -page mail survey containing 5 4 questions. The questions focused on general community concerns, community health and wellness concerns, personal health, preventive health, and demographic characteristics. The sample , obtained from a national vendor, was a stratified random sample to ensure that appropriate proportions from each of the two counties were included. A total of 1,500 records with names, addresses, and a few demographic indicators were included in the sample . Residents listed in the sample were first mailed an introductory postcard briefly explaining the project and notifying them that a survey packet would be arriving in their mail. Surveys packets, which contained the cover letter, scannable paper survey , and a pre-paid return envelope were mailed three days after the introductory postcards; 5 percent of the packets were returned as undeliverable. A reminder postcard containing a link to an on-line version of the survey was mailed to non -responders approxima tely 10 days after the initial survey was mailed. A total of 405 paper surveys were returned for scanning and an additional five surveys were completed on-line for a total of 410; the response rate was 27 percent. Upon further analysis, i t was apparent that elderly and male respondents were overrepresented in the scanned results. Therefore, post -stratification weight s were used to ensure proper representation of the population with respect to age and gender. Respondents who did not enter a gender and age response were eliminated from the analyses. A total of 3 91 surveys were analyzed providing a generalizable sample with a confidence level of 95 percent and an error rate of plus or minus 5 percentage points. Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in Beltrami and Clearwater counties. However, when comparing certain demographic characteristics INTRODUCTION 87 (i.e., age, income, minority status) with the current popu lation estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau1, it was evident that older, white, more highly educated, and higher income earners were overrepresented. Overrepresentation of this nature is typical in health needs assessments. Literature reviews indicate that there are nonresponse rate issues among younger respondents2. In particular, response rates to health care and community health needs assessment surveys have often been found to be higher for older respondents3. Studies have also shown lower respons e rates for socially disadvantaged groups4 (i.e., socially, culturally, or financially). . 1 U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division, Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States, States, and Counties: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013.

Study Design and Methodology The following report includes non -generalizable survey results from an April/May 2015 on-line survey conducted through a partnership between the Community Health Collaborative and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the on-line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Therefore, it is important to note that the data in this report are not generalizable to the community. Data collection occurred throughout the month of May 2015 and a total of 104 respondents participat ed in the on-line survey. A similar survey, in scannable paper form, was administered to a representative sample of community residents of the greater Bemidji area via the United States Postal Service. The on-line survey instrument used for this report was based largely on questions included in the paper survey format. However, some questions in the paper survey were modified for the on-line version of the survey and therefore are not comparable, particularly those questions relating to the Advance Care Directives for the aging population, safe places for outdo or youth activities, access to self -management education, alcohol use, and prescription or non -prescription drug abuse. 122 SURVEY RESULTS ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 126 General Health and Wellness Concerns about the Community ................................ ............................. 126 Figure 1.
