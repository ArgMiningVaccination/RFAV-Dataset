After rigorous evaluation and review of their accomplishments, leading individuals may be elected to one of the Society's three Academies\u2014the Academy of Arts and Humanities; the Academy of Social Sciences; and the Academy of Science. There are currently 2372 RSC Fellows. As a complement to the Academies, the RSC established The College of New Scholars, Scientists and Artists in 2014. The College recognizes individuals who have begun demonstrating leading scholarly, research or artistic excellence within 15 years of having completed their post-doctoral program or its equivalent. Members of the College are elected for a period of seven years. There are currently 325 Members of the College. In addition to Fellows and Members of the College, the RSC includes Institutional Members from throughout Canada that play key roles in advancing inclusive excellence for the benefit of Canada and the world. The RSC administers over 20 prestigious awards, most of which are awarded to those at various career stages in recognition of outstanding achievement. As emphasized in our by-laws, the RSC recognizes leaders in order to help them build a better future in Canada and around the world. For this reason, the RSC fulfills its mandate successfully to the extent that it recognizes excellence and then mobilizes the membership to make significant and substantial contributions of knowledge, understanding, and insight through engagement with the larger society. 2 The Royal Society of Canada MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT CHAD GAFFIELD In planning for, undertaking and now concluding my mandate as RSC President, I have kept in mind future assessments of our efforts to help Canada and the world make a better future. What is the \"extent and value\" of our contributions to the \"welfare of the country\"? Indeed, this question was explicitly posed in 1932 as the Royal Society of Canada celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. The RSC's leaders took stock of what had been accomplished over the previous decades to support Canada's transition from colony to nation. In a series of \"surveys of progress in Canada,\" RSC members focused on wide-ranging aspects of Canada's changing economic, social and cultural life during the later nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries. Taken together, the impact of the RSC was shown to be transformative. As the RSC editors of Fifty Years Retrospect concluded, \"The whole constitutes a striking proof of the dominating part taken by the Fellows of the Royal Society in the intellectual and scientific life of the Dominion for a half a century, and of the extent and value of the contributions made by the Society and its members to the welfare of their country.\" In looking back on 2019, my sense is that the RSC has built significantly on past achievements, thanks to the talent and devotion of members across Canada and beyond. The following pages highlight some of the compelling ways that the RSC Strategic Plan has continued to successfully focus and guide our work. The Plan's redefining of excellence as inclusive excellence has laid a strong foundation for ensuring that the leaders of specific initiatives were well-prepared to achieve optimal success. The RSC's historic advantage of including all fields from sciences and engineering to the social sciences and arts and humanities is proving to be increasingly important as global issues such as environmental change and digital transformations make clear that no specific expertise can fully address any major issue. This year's G7 Academy focus on, for example, AI and Society illustrated the RSC's quite unique ability to draw upon diverse epistemologies and metaphysics in helping draft the formal Statements addressed to decision-makers. Moreover, this past year emphasized again how the RSC's distinct multi-generational capacity accelerates the impact of valuable new perspectives and approaches to deeply complex issues. RSC College members continued to work shoulder-to-shoulder with RSC Fellows and partners to develop robust initiatives such as the \"Science, Trust and Democracy in the Digital Age\" symposium program that attracted a full-house audience to examine issues at the heart of Canada and the world's future. This symposium also featured significant attention to the challenges and opportunities of drawing upon distinct knowledge systems especially those based in western European traditions and in Indigenous knowledge systems. Taken together, these examples illustrate the essential importance of embracing inclusive excellence, and they strengthen the foundation of the Strategic Plan's call to increase our contributions to public debate and decision-making. I look forward to continuing to do all I can to support the RSC in future years. Many, many thanks to everyone who has contributed so much from the high-performance team at Walter House to Council colleagues, devoted RSC members, enthusiastic partners, and friends around the world. Chad Gaffield President 3 2019 Annual Report & COEE Programme MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DARREN GILMOUR Roughly two-thirds of the RSC's organizational and operational energy is devoted to the delivery of our \"core business\", the processes leading to the recognition of outstanding scientific, scholarly and artistic contributions across the disciplines and across the generations. A third of our collective energy is driven into a change agenda as articulated by the 2018-2022 RSC Strategic Plan: Mobilize, Catalyze, Sustain. Building on the first-year gains in implementing our strategic plan, 2019 provided opportunities to lengthen our stride as we seek to go further, together. Our operational areas of focus in mobilizing the membership included the enhancement of existing activities, especially the Celebration of Excellence and Engagement. After years of visiting two coasts and many cities in between, the COEE is this year being held in Ottawa, and our wonderful web of partnership support has considerably enhanced this must-attend set of 27 events focused on the exchange of insights and evidence. This year we have established a new ceiling, with only 600 registrants! The change agenda in mobilizing has been embodied by the increasing number and impact of RSC branches. RSC Atlantic continued its record of excellent contributions, while SRC Qu\u00e9bec and RSC Pacific further enhanced their impact by broadening the reach of their activities. The possibilities of RSC Prairies-North were meaningfully explored throughout the summer, and RSC@Massey was launched on October 28. In catalyzing new contributions, the RSC sharpened its focus for contributing science advice to policy and public discussions by publishing Next Steps in Sustainable Science Advice in Canada, an RSC Position Paper that built on previous Position Papers in its emphasis on support of the institutionalization of the office of the Chief Science Advisor. Our web presence and digital strategy grew to include steady activity on Twitter celebrating the contributions of the membership, and the RSC website hosts a comprehensive set of corporate publications as well as individual \"voices\" contributed by Members. The Committee on Public Engagement has been focused on enhancing our impact by identifying specific themes that address issues in the larger society and inviting scholarly inputs. The year will close with the publication of the first in a series of RSC Policy Briefings, which revisit the context, findings and recommendations of an RSC Expert Panel report, track the public-policy developments since publication, and identify the policy challenges that lie ahead. The inaugural RSC Policy Briefing is Sustaining Canadian Marine Biodiversity. Throughout 2019, our focus on sustaining momentum has been in continuing improvement on governance, management and the nomination and selection of new RSC members. The Standard Operating Procedures of the Academies and the RSC College are online, and the TOR of the Standing Committees of the Board have been updated. The orientation process for incoming Board and Council members embraces best practices, and HR policy updating and performance review processes exceed industry standards. As the literal embodiment of our efforts to sustain momentum, 282 Somerset Street is thriving hub of activity, convening communities and conversations throughout the year. With a multi-year facility improvement plan in place, sustainable financing\u2014and a handsomely increased market value for the facility itself\u2014the home of the RSC, just like the Walter House team working tirelessly to advance the RSC mandate, has its head turned toward the sun.

From late 2016 to late 2017, Fellows, Members of the College, Institutional Member leaders and others from larger society participated in meetings and gatherings across Canada. Eleven months of engagement and consultation produced a rich assortment of perspectives and ideas. Following the year-long consultation, the RSC made the following strategic choices for the coming five-year period: Mobilizing the Membership The strength of the RSC lies in its membership that spans research fields, generations and Canada together with members and partners around the world. The objective of this priority is to optimize this unique capacity by strategically mobilizing members to engage each other and the larger society on specific issues of concern. Catalyzing New Contributions The ability of the RSC to have impact in its activities is closely connected both to the means and the ends of such activities. In the changing context of the early 21st century, the objective of this priority is to create and implement new strategic ways to engage effectively in keeping with our unique cross-disciplinary and multigenerational membership, and the network of Institutional Members. Sustaining Momentum The success of the RSC over the past 135 years has reflected continuing efforts to renew and grow in keeping with the changing times. The objective of this priority is to ensure that near-term goals and activities are informed by a long- term vision to ensure the enduring success of the RSC. Branch initiatives enable the RSC community, as well as new and existing stakeholders and community institutions to engage more directly and dynamically in their distinct geographic areas. RSC Atlantic was established in 2008. Based on the success of this program the RSC has, since then, expanded with branches established in the Pacific region, in Quebec, in the Prairies and the North, and in Southern Ontario. Public events are frequently being organized by each of the RSC branches. Watch for events in your region on the RSC Events page and on your Twitter feed @RSCTheAcademies!BRANCHES OF THE RSC FROM COAST TO RSC is grateful to the University of Toronto for its support in establishing RSC@Massey.6 The Royal Society of Canada A I TC V IT I E SFor 15 years, the science academies of the G7 countries have been advising heads of state and government in the lead-up to the annual summits. Before each summit, the national science academies of the G7 study urgent global challenges relating to the summit agenda, and prepare statements from a global perspective to submit to the political leadership for consideration at the summit. The objective is to provide independent and collaborative scientific input. Over the years, statements have covered such issues as antibiotic resistance, disaster resilience and Arctic sustainability. The G7 science academies developed a three-year plan for 2018-2021 in which key themes, such as \"Our Digital Future\" from 2018, are sustained in the following year\u2014for example by \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Citizen Science\" in 2019. Elements of these themes will also inform the G7 agenda for 2020, providing the G7 Academies with increasing opportunity for engagement and impact. These themes endure because they are widely recognized as global challenges as well as challenges that benefit specifically from independent scientific advice. In addition, these themes present opportunities for the G7 president country to highlight pronounced research strengths. Over the course of two days in September 2019, the RSC convened 200 scholars, citizens, scientists and public policy practitioners from Canada, France and the United States to elaborate upon portions of the statements of the 2019 G7 Academies. Day 1 The first day of the symposium emphasized the importance of enhancing trust and further democratizing knowledge. Michelle Lamont of Harvard University emphasized that the word 'science' is not democratic\u2014it is an acquired knowledge by a selected few relative to the general population. At the same time, citizen science has become increasingly important as volunteers from across society SCIENCE, TRUST, AND DEMOCRACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE G7 RESEARCH SUMMIT, SEPTEMBER 2019, OTTAWA, ONTARIO Over 300 people attended the G7 Research Summit at the University of Ottawa, and enjoyed presentations such as this one featuring (L to R): Monica Gattinger, Antoine Petit, Mich\u00e8le Lamont, and Jacques Fr\u00e9mont. contribute scientifically to large-scale research initiatives. In this context, CNRS President Antoine Petit emphasized the need for more multidisciplinarity within the sciences and more humility from scientists in explaining and communicating their knowledge. Day 2 Day 2 of the symposium opened with a keynote from two Canadian scholars who emphasized the urgency of embracing all forms of knowledge, and indeed the need to expand our too-rigid classification of \"science\". Today, researchers acknowledge the interconnections of all living things with a pronounced respect for their histories, and for the intergenerational transfer of knowledge. A case of landscape-burning over the centuries by indigenous peoples highlighted the challenges inherent in capturing traditional knowledge faced with modern practices. Speakers gave the example of how, a century ago, government officials banned indigenous peoples Her Excellency Kareen Rispal, Ambassador of France in Ottawa, welcomed guests.7 2019 Annual Report & COEE Programme A I TC V IT I E S \"I am reflecting on the marvel of sitting in the former Chapel at the University of Ottawa, at a session convened by the Royal Society of Canada and Embassy of France to listen to Indigenous ways of knowing and hearing a language on the edge of extinction. A great contribution to Canada, and a symbol of how much we are changing as a country. And the next session on AI and the future of work will stretch us in a different direction!\" -Paul Davidson, President, Universities Canada(Above) CFI President Roseann O'Reilly-Runte moderates a session reflecting on G7 themes and the impact of the academies, featuring (L to R) Chad Gaffield, RSC President; Pierre Corvol, President, Acad\u00e9mie des sciences (France); and John Boright, Executive Director, International Affairs of the US National Academies. (Below) Elder Claudette Commanda, Algonquin Anishinabe from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation, greets the attendees and opens the summit. \"An excellent and stimulating workshop, well done.\" \"Beautifully planned, directed, and orchestrated.\" \"Great panels and thoughtful Kudos!\" \"Tr\u00e8s Bravo!\" \"It was brilliant in providing a broaded base upon which our individual responses to these challenges can be built. Well done!\" \"Merci et f\u00e9licitations, surtout pour l'attention au bilinguisme.\"from setting fires strategically to manage wildfires. Today, experts all agree on the importance of such tactics. This is just one example of the efforts underway to integrate historically different knowledge systems in order to benefit all societies. This was just one example of the ways in which indigenous knowledge must not stand in the shadow of western knowledge. The panel discussion that followed was an inter- generational session highlighting how current economic and technological changes have short-term impacts that may be overestimated and longer-term impacts that may be underestimated. While certain dimensions of work can be best handled via AI, the role of humans in interpreting results and shaping decisions will remain crucially important. In her presentation, Dr. Mona Nemer, Canada's Chief Science Advisor, drew a parallel between AI and the genomics revolution, underscoring the need for ongoing and inclusive dialogue as well as humility. It is imperative, Dr. Nemer emphasized, that ethical, legal and social questions be addressed at the outset, rather than after the fact. In addition, communicating well beyond the boundaries of the \"research bubble\" is critical, especially due to the inability to predict the consequences of change. 8 The Royal Society of Canada A I TC V IT I E STHE YEAR IN PICTURES EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN 2019 RSC@Massey Inaugural Reception October 28, Massey College, Toronto Massey College hosted the inaugural RSC@Massey Event, including welcomes from (l to r) Chad Gaffield, Massey Principal Nathalie Des Rosiers, and University of Toronto Vice-President Vivek Goel.Navigating Your Journey October 26, Saint John, New Brunswick RSC Atlantic, along with NaviCare/SoinsNavi's Family Advisory Council, coordinated the Navigating Your Journey workshop developed for families with children and youth with complex care needs.

It is therefore more urgent than ever for governments to obtain sound expert advice before acting, especially in formulating public policies. Yet, paradoxically, falsehoods can now propagate globally in seconds, encouraged by a growing number of leaders around the world who actively disparage the sciences, their proponents and practitioners, and their conclusions. In this context, governments must depend on a robust science capacity that can be brought to bear on the key questions of today, and to prepare for those of tomorrow. Fortunately for Canada, transformative federal leadership has underpinned the emergence and development since the 1970s of a world-class science capacity. This federal leadership has been significantly renewed since 2015, and Canada is internationally praised for the quality and breadth in fields across the natural and health sciences, humanities, engineering, arts, and social sciences. Moreover, this quality and breadth characterizes campuses and insitutions across provinces and territories. Unfortunately, though, a significant gap separates this world-class science capacity from actual government decision-making. Few clear pathways enable and facilitate engagement between those inside government and leading scientists and scholars across Canada, the vast majority of whom receive federal research funding. Decisions have been taken recently to coordinate and strengthen science inside government, as well as to improve collaboration across federal extramural research agencies. However, federal action has not been taken to close the internal- external gap. The result is that the federal government cannot effectively and efficiently call upon Canada's world-class science capacity to help address all the urgent social, technological and environmental challenges that face government decision-makers in the 21st century. Recognizing this context, the RSC's Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 emphasized with increased urgency its historic position that expert, independent, and objective scientific advice is fundamental to policy development and decision-making. The RSC committed to the \"implementation of a sharpened focus for contributing advice to policy and public discussion\". That commitment builds on the RSC's Position Paper in 2015, which set out the vital importance of science advice, and the attributes that ideally characterize both such advice and the structures/personnel to deliver it. The federal government responded quickly to recommendations from the RSC and others to follow through on a 2015 platform promise to re-establish the position of Chief Science Advisor. The platform in the same breath committed that the Chief Science Advisor would ensure \"that scientific analyses are considered when the government makes decisions.\" The machinery to fulfill that promise, however, remains inadequate. It is now urgent that attention be focused on closing the inside-outside gap through creation of explicit pathways that enable and facilitate external science advice. Specifically, the RSC suggests there are two crucial next steps: 1. The RSC recommends that Canada's Chief Science Advisor be formally recognized as the Government's key interlocutor connecting external science and government, and that this role be embodied in legislation. In particular, the Chief Science Advisor must be empowered to clarify and strengthen the Government's internal processes for determining an agenda of issues requiring external scientific advice. 2. The RSC recommends that the Government of Canada act expeditiously to create a high- level science and technology advisory committee, and that this committee be embodied in legislation. We further recommend that the CSA serve as co-chair (or chair) with an external co-chair (or vice-chair) selected from among the appointees by the Government of Canada. We further recommend that the presidents of the Royal Society of Canada along with the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences and the Canadian Academy of Engineering sit ex- officio on the new committee in order to strengthen government knowledge of, and access to, leaders across Canada's science communities.

It is changing rapidly, as a result of the democratization of knowledge, new and faster communication technologies and increased open access to information. A first - and major- component of citizen science is the 21stcentury version of the long established \u00ab Community-Based Participatory Research \u00bb. CBPR is usually performed by people with little formal s cientific training participating in research projects coordinated by trained experts. It now takes the form of many projects across the world involving millions of people and billions of data items collected. A second emerging component involves individuals having a solid scientific background, but working outside the walls of the u sual professional research systems. They do science in public or private virtual communities or in private settings. This category of citizen science is referred to, here, as \"Beyond The Walls Research\" (BTWR). In the present Internet era, the potential value of these approaches to research is high: CBPR may contribute to improving public understanding of science and the scientific method, and can thus p lay a role in democratizing knowledge and learning. BTWR offers an opportunity to advance knowledge and innovation in ways that were previously inaccessible to the academic, government or industrialorganizations of research, and constitutes an opportunity - widely used by industry - to discover talented individuals outside the standard research system. Alongside these potential benefits come ris ks, especially around the evaluation of results stemming f rom CBPR and BTWR. These results are often disseminated through diverse channels outside the traditional peer-review system. There are also risks that ethical guidelines and safety regulations that apply to research carried out in the standard professional framework are not followed by those engaged in this new citizen science and, therefore, there is a need for anticipation and control. F inally, the development of citizen science requires an increased effort in the scientific training of the citizen at all ages, starting at school, and the integration of perspectives in the arts and humanities, law, education, social sciences and ethics as well as natural sciences and engineering. Recommendations The detailed recommendations are at the end of the statement. nRethink scientific education to equip students to undertake citizen science or professional research later on. nTake action to avoid or mitigate ethical lapses and security risks of citizen science. nPromote the co-development of citizen science and laboratory-based research. nEnable citizen scientists to adopt existing culture of reporting and assessing scientific contri- butions . nCreate specific funding programs for citizen science. nPromote information systems to document themes and results of citizen science.Summit of the G7 science academies Citizen science in the Internet era47 2019 Annual Report & COEE Programme P L AU I TB C I NO S 50 La science citoyenne \u00e0 l'\u00e8re de l'InternetExecutive summary Citizen science is by definition carried out by citizens who are not \u00ab scientific professionals \u00bb.

The increasing pace of technological change, and the need for science and innovation contributions to solve local and global challenges requires societal trust in science. It is essential that we find ways to maintain and increase confidence in science. It is the responsibility of everyone, scientists, e ducators, the media and politicians to establish or maintain a relationship of informed trust between science and society. Policy makers should encourage and scientists should commit to: nPromote science education and an understanding of how research is conducted from elementary school onwards, to ensure that all students, both girls and boys, acquire a sufficient background to under stand the world around them and the benefits of science. nCultivate dialogue, mutual trust and confidence between public, politicians and scientists to ensurethat scientific input is considered in decision-making especially on topics of high scientific content. nEnsure that the fundamental principles of ethics, integrity and responsibility are a major component of science education, to increase aware ness o f scientific responsibility and of the structures and policies that support it, including peer review and research ethics boards and transparency about potential conflicts of interest. Breaches of ethics and research integrity should be treated with full transparency and rigor to ensure that the misconduct of a few does not discredit the whole scientific endeavor. nEnsure that the evaluation of science i s based on criteria of quality, reproducibility, originality and relevance rather than on counts of publications, citations, or impact factors to avoid the race for publication that downgrades the value of scientific research and can lead to breaches in scientific integrity.

It established a series of five Expert Panels to study the issues and provide recommendations for next steps. It is now timely to revisit the findings of these Expert Panel Reports. What impact have they had? Have their recommendations been implemented? What are the next steps in terms of policy options? To answer these questions, the RSC is establishing a Policy Briefing Committee (PBC) for each Expert Panel Report. The tasks of each PBC are to: describe the context, findings, and recommendations of the report; track policy developments in relation to the panel's findings and recommendations; and identify future policy challenges and implementation options. An important distinction from the work of each original expert panel is that the PBCs will not undertake reviews of the scientific literature, but instead focus on matters with respect to findings and recommendations issued by the reports and subsequent public policy developments. This Policy Briefing Committee Reports examines policy and statutory developments since publication of the RSC's 2012 Expert Panel Report on Sustaining Marine Biodiversity: Responding to the Challenges Posed by Climate, Change, Fisheries, and Aquaculture. Members Prof. Julia K. Baum, Department of Biology, University of Victoria Dr. Susanna D. Fuller, Senior Projects Manager, Oceans NorthProf. Jeffrey A. Hutchings, FRSC, Department of Biology, Dalhousie University, (Chair)Mr. Josh Laughren, Executive Director, Oceana Canada Prof. David L. VanderZwaag , Canada Research Chair in Ocean Law and Governance, Marine & Environmental Law Institute, Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University49 2019 Annual Report & COEE Programme Executive Summary Overarching Findings of the 2012 Expert Panel Canada faces significant challenges in its efforts to conserve and sustain marine biodiversity in light of climate change, fisheries, and aquaculture; Canada should fulfil national and international obligations to protect existing diversity and to rebuild depleted populations and species to restore natural diversity; Such a strategy would restore the natural resilience of Canada's ocean ecosystems to enable them to adapt in response to challenges posed by climate change and other anthropogenic activities. Impact of the 2012 Expert Panel Report on Sustaining Marine Biodiversity The Report has been cited more than 75 times in documents, reports, and other submissions by NGOs, Government, Industry-Affiliated Organizations, and Academia; The Report has had impact by providing an objective assessment of, and recommendations for, strengthening commitments to sustain marine biodiversity; There have been significant developments to Canadian policy and law, including amendments to the Fisheries Act, that align with the Report's recommendations. Policy and Statutory Developments Since the 2012 Expert Panel Report Good Progress by the Government of Canada is reflected by: prioritizing oceans stewardship and biodiversity conservation; strengthening the evidentiary use of science in decision-making; amending statutes, such as the Fisheries Act and Oceans Act; exceeding the goal to protect 10% of marine and coastal areas by 2020; increasing transparency & accountability through public release of mandate letters. Moderate Progress by the Government of Canada is reflected by: explicit provisions for stock rebuilding in the Fisheries Act; statutory application of a Precautionary-Approach fisheries reference point; consultations on the development of potential federal aquacultur e legislation; public reporting of progress in achieving targets for biodiversity and fisheries status; increased transparency on listing decisions for aquatic species at risk. There has been Limited or Insufficient Progress in: incorporating climate change in decisions on fisheries, oceans, or marine biodiversity; resolving regulatory conflict (conserve/exploit) within Fisheries & Oceans Canada; marine spatial planning to mitigate conflict as ocean-use pressures increase; reducing ministerial discretion on matters related to fisheries and oceans; clarifying ambiguities in sustainable fisheries policy on the Precautionary Approach.50 The Royal Society of Canada Tracking Policy and Statutory Progress Since 2012 RSC 2012 Expert Panel Recommendation 1: Establish international leadership in oceans stewardship and biodiversity conservation as a top government priority. Good Progress: (i) policy and statutory renewal; (ii) public release of mandate letters; (iii) new investments in government science; and (iv) multiple audits under the auspices of the Office of the Auditor General. RSC 2012 Expert Panel Recommendation 2: Resolve regulatory conflicts of interest within DFO (i.e., Fisheries & Oceans Canada) that affect Canada's obligation to sustain marine biodiversity. Limited Progress: (i) new provision in the Fisheries Act for independent advisory bodies; and (ii) increased ministerial accountability through publicly available mandate letters. RSC 2012 Expert Panel Recommendation 3: Reduce the discretionary power in fisheries management decisions exercised by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Moderate Progress evidenced by a new Fisheries Act that: (i) provides for stock rebuilding; (ii) formalizes application of a Precautionary-Approach fisheries reference point; and (iii) provides for establishment of independent advisory bodies. RSC 2012 Expert Panel Recommendation 4: Rapidly increase DFO's rate of statutory and policy implementation. Limited Progress: (i) revised Oceans Act allows for increased establishment of Marine Protected Areas; (ii) new commitment to render listing decisions under the Species at Risk Act within 36 months; and (iii) new statutory acknowledgement, in the Fisheries Act, of elements of Sustainable Fisheries Framework policies. RSC 2012 Expert Panel Recommendation 5: Implement statutory renewal to fulfil national and international commitments to sustain marine biodiversity. Moderate Progress reflected by: (i) amended Fisheries Act, Oceans Act, and Canada Petroleum Resources Act; (ii) consultations on potential federal aquaculture legislation; and (iii) new policy for species-at-risk listing decisions for aquatic species. RSC 2012 Expert Panel Recommendation 6: Establish national operational objectives, indicators, and targets for marine biodiversity. Moderate Progress reflected by (i) national reporting of progress towards achieving Canada's biodiversity targets and (ii) audits to track progress in improving marine fisheries stock status and implementing marine policy commitments.51 2019 Annual Report & COEE Programme Looking Ahead: Recommendations 1. Ensure climate change impacts and projections are incorporated into decision making and planning processes related to marine biodiversity. Effects of climate change on species and ecosystems are not readily reversible; The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2019 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate highlighted the urgency of prioritizing ambitious, coordinated action to address unprecedented, enduring ocean changes; Failure to incorporate climate change in ocean-related policies will have significant consequences for Canada's marine biodiversity, fisheries, and aquaculture. 2. Resolve regulatory conflicts of interest affecting progress in fulfilling obligations to sustain marine biodiversity. DFO has responsibilities both to conserve and exploit marine biodiversity; This regulatory conflict impedes progress in sustaining marine biodiversity; Limit or eliminate real and perceived regulatory conflicts of interest; strengthen ministerial accountability for policy commitments to use and conserve biodiversity; financially account for environmental costs associated with biodiversity loss. 3. Limit the discretionary power in fisheries management decisions exercised by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Ministerial discretion hinders progress in sustaining marine biodiversity; Discretion permits the fishing of stocks in the critical zone, such as NL's northern cod; Regulations are required to give effect to the Fisheries Act's rebuilding provisions, ideally to maintain stocks at levels that maximize long-term sustainable harvests. 4. Clarify ambiguities in Canada's sustainable fisheries policy framework. The Precautionary Approach (PA) is open to misuse and misinterpretation; Policy should unambiguously clarify the roles of science, fisheries management, and vested interests in setting PA-compliant rebuilding targets and harvest decision rules; Science advice should always be publicly distinguishable from other sources of advice during implementation of the PA in fisheries management decision-making. 5. Advance and implement marine spatial planning (MSP). Increased use of coastal waters is intensifying spatial conflict between activities such as infrastructure projects, fishing, aquaculture, shipping, and protected areas; Meaningful, respectful, coordinated efforts to advance and implement MSP , with comprehensive zonal ecosystem-based initiatives, has potential to mitigate conflict; The Oceans Act should be revised to explicitly require MSP , establish clear planning procedures, and provide for enforceability of finalized plans.52 The Royal Society of Canada HOW TO SUPPORT THE RSC OPERATIONS Opportunities for Giving The Royal Society of Canada is a Charitable Organization, (Charitable Reg. #10793 5991 RR0001).
