REALITY: Measles outbreak 2008 HI Boutbreak 2008/09 (10 deaths)MYTH #2 Too many shots, too soon.REALITY: Thank goodness we have more shots. These are safer and smarter vaccines. Smallpox, oral polio, DTwP It may look like more shots, but the immune load is actually LESS.MYTH #3 Thimerosal causes autism.REALITY Mercury removed in 2001. Rates of Autism still rising.MYTH #4 MMR causes autism.REALITY Japan switched from MMR to separate vaccines in 1993. Autism rates still rising.Reality: Causes of Autism Genetic: several defects, including Fragile X Fathers over age 40 Extreme prematurity (<25 weeks) Medications during pregnancy MYTH #5 It's all a government conspiracy to protect Big Pharma and inject cancer-causing agents into our children. REALITY: This would be the largest worldwide conspiracy in history. Just ask your doc if she vaccinates her child.MYTH #6: We need to green our vaccines REALITY Aluminum is the #1 metal in the earth's crust. It's in our water, soil, and food (including breastmilk)... and our deoderant. The amount is scant compared to our daily exposures.MYTH #7: It's safer to use an alternative or staggered vaccination schedule REALITY Delaying vaccinations leaves the most susceptible at risk. \"My schedule doesn't have any research behind it. No one has ever studied a big group of kids using my schedule to determine if it's safe or if it has any benefits .\"\u2014Dr Bob SearsVaccine information cdc.gov/vaccines/conversations aap.org vaccine.chop.edu immunize.org "}
