[PUBLICATION](/publication.html) | | THE POWER OF RITUAL RETURNING TO OUR ANCESTRAL WAYS written by Black Women Healing Retreats Rituals have been part of black culture since the beginning of time. Our ancestors worked with the elements, and connected with the sun, moon, and stars to bring forth manifestation, sustainability and healing. The Dagara Tribe in West Africa often used spiritual practices such as communing with nature and using rituals to tap into the spiritual realm. The Yoruba practices encouraged prayers, spiritual dances and connections with deities like Oshun and Ogun. Spirituality for black people has always been about connecting with the Earth. Today though, black people have been disconnected from rituals. During slavery Black people had their culture, original faith and spirituality taken away from them. They were conditioned to believe that their own spirituality that once healed them was a dark witch craft. Like many African traditions, Many things which were once positive are now presented as negative, this is why it is necessary to understand our history. | | WAYS THERAPY HELPED ME AS A BLACK WOMAN written by Jada Walton In 2018, I started seeing a therapist and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. First, just know that therapy never gave me any miracle breakthrough moment like in the movies, that's not real. It did provide numerous moments of clarity, good advice, and self-reflection. It also helped me better understand myself and why I do certain things (trauma that comes from years of being a giver and having too much pride to ask for help). Most importantly, it provided me with validation, reassuring me that I wasn't \"crazy\" when things got too intense for me to comprehend. | | CRYSTAL HEALING: REASONS YOU NEED & DESERVE CRYSTALS IN YOUR LIFE written by LeAndra Williams For many years, women have suffered through depression, anxiety, and PTSD, among other physical, mental, and emotional trauma. For years, women have been taught to \"pray\" our hurt away, to sex our pain away, or to drink our pain away. Throughout history we've seen countless remedies from natural to pharmaceutical that claim to help alleviate these daily pains from our lives. Although there are countless of remedies out there, I have yet to find one full-proof way of eliminating these painful symptoms, until now. I am here to not only tell you how crystals changed my life, but also how these benefits could be the secret weapon to your freedom. | | BLACK WOMEN SHOULD GET BACK TO NATURE RETURNING TO OUR ESSENCE written by Black Women Healing Retreats There is no battle against the common understanding that black people originated in Africa. Black women, in their most natural essence, lived in nature. Women's bodies were viewed as holy-- women didn't feel pressured to cover their naked breasts, because this was an acceptable sign of nurture and life. This was the understanding of nature before colonization was imposed upon black people, which created a society where a woman's body was seen as something strictly sexual. Black people walked barefoot, and ate nutritious fruit from their surroundings. Tribes practiced tribal dances and spoke their own languages. They heard hymns from the trees and bathed in rivers: they were at one with nature, the ultimate healer of life. | | HEALING SISTERHOOD CONNECTIONS written by Leandra Williams Inspirational speaker Iyanla Vanzant once said, \"We are women. Everything we do matters. I am not my sister's keeper. I am my sister.\" With society disproportionately painting negative images of Black women interacting with one another, it's no wonder that we continue to have issues with effectively communicating with each other and treating our sisters well. As a Black woman, I strongly feel we want a closer bond with our sisters, but with institutionalized classism, colorism, and ageism, society continues to dictate what we believe Black women should look and act like. Often, this stops us from making a genuine connection with other black women. | | THE IMPORTANCE OF EXERCISING FOR BLACK WOMEN written by Erika L Harper, LPC One of the main areas that Black women are behind the eight ball is with our health. In 2019, despite decades of marketing pushes about eating healthy and working out, Black women still rank higher than women of other races for dying from various cardiovascular-related diseases. Simultaneously, we have made progress. Even though we are the most likely to be afflicted with heart disease, there are still fewer of us dying from these diseases than ever before. With that being said, we still have a lot of work to do.
