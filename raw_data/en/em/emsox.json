Despite numerous studies showing no connection between the two, many parents remain concerned about the safety of vaccinations. At Nao Medical, we understand these concerns and are here to provide you with the facts. The MMR Vaccine and Autism: What the Research Says Multiple studies have been conducted over the years to investigate the potential link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The overwhelming consensus among the scientific community is that there is no connection between the two. One of the most well-known studies was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2013. The study analyzed the medical records of over 95,000 children and found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Other studies have also found no connection between the MMR vaccine and autism, including a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2015. Why the Myth Persists Despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the myth that the MMR vaccine causes autism persists. This is due in part to a now-discredited study published in The Lancet in 1998 that claimed to find a link between the two. The study has since been retracted, and the lead author, Andrew Wakefield, has been stripped of his medical license. However, the damage had already been done. The study received widespread media attention and fueled anti-vaccination sentiment that persists to this day.
