In the United States, autoimmune diseases affects an estimated 25 million people-it is the fastest growing category of disease. That's a staggering number of individuals struggling with conditions like type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, lupus, and other issues like allergies and eczema. So many autoimmune patients feel confused, hopeless, or uninformed about their diagnosis and face poor quality of life despite conventional therapy; it can take three years and visits to four different health professionals to receive a formal, correct diagnosis of autoimmunity -even though that is the best time for early intervention in which holistic treatments can lead to major benefits. After working with these patients in his two decades of practice, Harvard-trained Dr. Akil Palanisamy was inspired to develop The T.I.G.E.R. Protocol, an integrative treatment approach combining his work as a functional medicine practitioner with his training in Ayurvedic medicine, the traditional medicine of India. He has since used this simple protocol to successfully treat thousands of patients. Through this 2-phase protocol, you will: - Address Toxins - Heal Infections - Improve Your Gut Health - Learn to Eat Right - Consciously Rest and Rebalance Managed In a two-phase elimination and reintroduction diet, the protocol works to address the root cause of your autoimmunity instead of treating just the symptoms. Find healing and freedom by following this simple food-based protocol. Genre: - \"A holistic and clinically proven approach to treating autoimmune disease that can help millions of people afflicted by this epidemic.\"\u2014Dr. William Li, MD, New York Times bestselling author of Eat to Beat Disease and Eat to Beat Your Diet - \"Dr. Akil Palanisamy combines his extensive clinical experience with leading-edge research to create a detailed roadmap to health for those with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Filled with the most up-to-date, evidence-based information on the microbiome, environmental toxins, and the mind-body connection, The T.I.G.E.R. Protocol is a must-read for anyone serious about optimizing their immune health and vitality.\"\u2014Dr. Andrew Weil, world-renowned integrative medicine physician - \"So often we are led to believe we can rid ourselves of our common ailments with the latest breakthroughs in pharmaceutical science. As so many have experienced, this approach generally disappoints. Dr. Akil provides us with foundational information, empowering the reader with a straightforward action plan to reverse disease and pave the way for optimal health. We need to take his teachings seriously as they are a gift.\"\u2014David Perlmutter, MD, New York Times bestselling author of Grain Brain and Drop Acid - \"What if there is a much better way to get to the root of autoimmune disease so that you can either halt it in its tracks or reverse it? Dr. Akil Palanisamy provides a revolutionary integrative medicine approach that does just that!\"\u2014Victoria Maizes, MD, Executive Director, Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona - \"Autoimmune disease has increased in prevalence over the past 40 years and is now poised to be one of the leading causes of both shortened lifespan and quality of life. Unfortunately, the accepted strategies to manage these conditions are not infrequently as concerning as the disease itself. Fortunately, Dr. Akil has developed an approach to address the many factors contributing to autoimmunity. If you or someone you love suffers from autoimmunity, this book revolutionizes our understanding of autoimmune diseases.\" \u2014Robb Wolf, New York Times bestselling author of Wired to Eat - \"1 in 6 Americans now suffer from autoimmunity, and conventional treatment is focused on suppressing symptoms with drugs. The T.I.G.E.R. Protocol offers a natural and effective \"root cause\" approach to healing autoimmune disease based on Dr. Akil's unique blend of functional medicine, ayurveda, and ancestral nutrition. I recommend this book to anyone seeking a more holistic approach to autoimmune disease.\"\u2014Chris Kresser, New York Times bestselling author of The Paleo Cure - \"In The T.I.G.E.R. Protocol, Dr. Palanisamy has created a fantastic, groundbreaking guidebook for treating autoimmune disease that empowers readers with science-backed actionable tools to optimize their health and well-being.\"\u2014Michelle Tam, New York Times bestselling cookbook author and creator of Nom Nom Paleo - \"The Tiger Protocol is an invaluable evidence-based guide to the current state of knowledge about autoimmune disease and is designed to empower patients in living well with chronic illness.
