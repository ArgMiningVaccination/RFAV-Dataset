The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is the main source of information on Americans' health. In 2002, 2007, and 2012, the NHIS included a section, developed by NCHS and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), on the use of complementary and integrative health approaches. Information was collected on adults in all three years and on children in 2007 and 2012. Each year, interviewers visit between 35,000 and 40,000 households to ask people questions about their health. The interviewers ask adults about their own health, and they also ask them about the health of children in the household. Once every five years, the NHIS includes questions about complementary health approaches. The 2012 survey collected information on the use of many complementary health approaches, including popular ones like dietary supplements, chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, yoga, massage, and meditation.
