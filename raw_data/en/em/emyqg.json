To Request an Action Plan to Address Safe Alternatives to Drugs [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Safe Alternatives to Drugs The Alternative Perspective Science has finally mounted enough evidence to strongly recommend avoidance of allopathic drugs during pregnancy due to the dangers to the infant. We should be even more cautious from birth to adolescence when a child is still in the formative years of vital growth and development. During these stages there is no mother's placenta or liver to filter and lessen the side-effects and toxic effects of any drugs taken. The child's best protection is safe, natural alternatives, such as those offered by homeopathy. It's shocking to know that the current American Medical System is this country's leading cause of death and injury. Conservatively speaking, almost 800,000 people per year die from properly prescribed and properly taken pharmaceutical drugs. This does not include deaths from accidental poisonings, purposeful drug abuse, or illegal drugs. Let that number sink in. Nearly 800,000 per year! Can you imagine the outcry and backlash if even 8 people per year died from natural remedies? Yet we accept this outrageous statistic of medical negative side-effects without a blink of an eye, as if it's just the price we must pay for medical care. A roll of the dice as to whether the drugs will help, injure or kill. As we in the field of natural health care know, it doesn't have to be this way. There are safe, effective alternatives. And, in the case of homeopathy, this fact has been proven for more than 200 years - far longer than the modern pharmaceutical industry's history. Homeopathy What is homeopathy? Homeopathy is a scientific system of corrective healthcare that activates the body's own healing processes in order to cure diseases naturally, gently, and promptly. Homeopathy is a natural pharmaceutical science that uses very small or infinitesimal doses of substances from the plant, mineral or animal kingdom to activate the body's nervous system to initiate the healing process. The word \"homeopathy\" is derived from the Greek \"homoios\" meaning similar and \"pathos\" meaning suffering. The German physician and chemist Dr. Samuel Hahnemann founded the science of homeopathy in the late 1700's. While performing research into the toxicological effects of the medicines of his time, Dr. Hahnemann discovered that a concentration of a substance that evoked symptoms in a healthy person, would, in its homeopathically potentized state, correct those similar symptoms in a sick person. Potentization is the serial dilutions and successions of a substance. Through numerous experiments, he advanced the theory that \"likes are cured by likes,\" and today it is a verified law oh pharmacology, the Law of Similars. For instance, ipecac in a large dose causes nausea and vomiting. An ill person suffering from the same or similar symptoms improves after taking a homeopathically prepared dilution of ipecac. Another example is the symptoms caused by being exposed to sliced onions. The eyes may burn and water profusely, and the nose, too, may water and sneezing may occur. These symptoms produced by sliced onions are similar to those of hay fever. As you might expect, one remedy for hay fever is the onion, specifically diluted to exact homeopathic principles. Current Applications of Homeopathy You also see application of the Law of Similars in genetics, physics, chemistry, and immunology. Physics In physics, opposite poles of a magnet attract while similar poles repel. By placing similar poles next to each other, a weakened magnet will be recharged/regenerated or restored by the Law of Similars. Chemistry A basic principle of solvent chemistry states that a substance will be a solvent to another substance when it has similar type of molecular bond. It has to be either similarly polar or similarly apolar, and then like will dissolve like. Immunology, of course, crudely applies the Law of Similars to activate antibody response with small doses of similar substances that will evoke the allergic symptoms. Immunology Homeopathy works not so much bio-chemically, but more so bio-energetically, to correct nerve interference throughout the whole nervous system, especially where the hands of the chiropractor cannot reach. Homeopathy is potentized with serial dilutions and successions beyond the molecular level. And, through its proving, this over 200-year-old science offers chiropractic the detailed compilation of neuro-sensory reflex responses to the substances of the environment, better equipping us to attend the whole nervous system. When the energetic control systems of the body (like the nervous system) work properly, everything else works better, and the body's chemistry will balance out accordingly. Every chemical within our body has a very specific charge to respond and do what it is told by the energetic control system. Homeopathies Focus Whole Body Focus Homeopathic remedies focus on the whole person and the body's own natural defense systems. Homeopathy activates the body's own healing processes at both the physical and mental/emotional levels. The range of problems in which homeopathy can be effectively used is extensive and includes first aid, acute illnesses, and all manners of chronic conditions. Homeopathy, the first alternative medicine to have ascended to recognition by the FDA, offers curative solutions with - no known negative side-effects, - no potential for addiction, and - no known negative drug interactions. This is a far cry from allopathic medications with their plethora of possible side-effects, toxic and/or allergic reactions, addictions, and even life-threatening negative interactions. These side-effects simply do not exist with homeopathic solutions to pain or any other symptom.
