The general population should be vaccinated once the above populations have had the opportunity to be vaccinated. The use of chemotherapeutic agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza is an important adjunct for disease control during outbreaks among unvaccinated individuals, or for individuals at risk for whom the vaccine is contraindicated or ineffective. 1 The neuraminidase inhibitors and the adamantanes are the two classes of drugs available for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B. 3,4 Neuraminidase inhibitors block viral release during the replication cycles of influenza A and B. Through inhibition of neuraminidase, the new virions are tethered to the cellular membrane glycoproteins of their parent cells and cannot spread to other cells.5,6 Oseltamivir and zanamivir should be administered as early as possible and are indicated only for use during the first two days of symptomatic illness. 3,4,7 When used for the treatment of influenza, oseltamivir is FDA -approved for use in persons two weeks of age and older, and zanamivir may be used in persons seven years of age and older. As influenza prophylaxis oseltamivir is approved for use in persons one year of age and older, while zanamivir is approved for prophylaxis in persons five years of age and older. It is important to note that oseltamivir and zanamivir are not substitutes for early vaccination on an annual basis as recommended above . 3,4 Zanamivir should not be used for the prophylaxis or treatment of influenza in individuals with underlying airway disease.4 The adamantanes, amantadine and rimantadine , prevent viral replication by blocking the viral M2 protein ion channel, which prevents fusion of the virus and host -cell membranes.8,9 Amantadine and rimantadine, are active only against influenza A.1 Both amantadine and rimantadine are approved for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A.8,9 Due to a marked increase in resistant isolates, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that adamantanes not be used in the United States for the treatment of influenza, except in selected circumstances.1 Table 1.

Evidence- based M edicine Oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in both the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A and B. Clinical trials have demonstrated reduced laboratory -confirmed influenza, decreased illness, fever duration, secondary complications, as well as a reduction in household contacts with i nfluenza infection.10-33 Head-to-head trials directly comparing the agents are limited. Kawai and colleagues compared oseltamivir to zanamivir for the treatment of both influenza A and B. Results demonstrated significantly shorter fever duration in patients with influenza B who were treated with zanamivir, compared to those treated with oseltamivir. 30 Clinical trials have demonstrated that amantadine and rimantadine are also effective in both the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A; however, these agents are not routinely recommended for the treatment of influenza.29,32,34 -44 With regard to Parkinson's disease, data from one clinical trial included in a meta- analysis demonstrated that patients receiving amantadine as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy for idiopathic Parkinson's disease achieved greater benefits in Parkinsonian symptoms severity scale scores and activity impairment scale scores compared to placebo. Furthermore, for the treatment of drug- induced extrapyramidal reactions, amantadine has demonstrated efficacy in reducing dyskinesia frequency and severity, as well as motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease. 45-52 Key Points within the Medication Class According to C urrent Clinical G uidelines: o According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most effective way to minimize the negative impact of influenza is through prophylaxis, by administration of the influenza vaccine. 1 o An annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons six months of age and older in the U nited States .2 o Antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for: Patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness or who require hospitalization.53-56 Outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are at higher risk for influenza complications on the basis of their age or underlying medical conditions. 53-56 o Persons at higher risk for influenza complications recommended for antiviral treatment include: Children less than two years of age.

Page 1 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Therapeutic Class Review Antivirals: Influenza Overview/Summary Influenza epidemics occur nearly every year, usually during the winter months, in temperate climates, making this disease a major cause of respiratory illness in the United States (U.S.) .1 The majority of complications, hospitalizations and deaths from influenza occur in persons over 65 years of age, young children, and persons of any age with certain underlying health conditions.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most effective way to minimize the negative impact of influenza is through prophylaxis, by administration of the influenza vaccine. 1 For the 2013- 2014 influenza season, interim guidance from t he Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices contin ues to recommend annual influenza vaccination for all persons six months of age and older in the U.S.2 It is specifically recommended annually for older persons (65 years of age), young children, pregnant women and individuals considered high risk, including immunocompromised persons and those with comorbidities such as chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular and chronic metabolic diseases, or any disorder interfering with respiratory function. The CDC recommends vaccination of the general population once the patient populations previously outlined have had the opportunity to be vaccinated, which may be dictated by that year's vaccine supply. The use of chemotherapeutic agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza is an important adjunct for disease control during outbreaks among unvaccinated individuals, or for individuals at risk for whom the vaccine is contraindicated or ineffective. 1 The neuraminidase inhibitors and the adamantanes are the two classes of drugs available for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B. 3,4 Neuraminidase inhibitors work by blocking viral release mechanisms during the replication cycles of influenza A and B. Neuraminidase is necessary for release of daughter virions from infected cell s. Without the action of neuraminidase, the new virions are tethered to the cellular membrane glycoproteins of their parent cells and cannot spread to other cells. 5,6 Oseltamivir and zanamivir must be administered as early as possible and are indicated only for use during the first two days of symptomatic illness.3,4,7 When used for the treatment of influenza , oseltamivir is FDA -approved for use in persons two weeks of age and older, and zanamivir may be used in persons seven years of age and older. As infl uenza prophylaxis oseltamivir is approved for use in persons one year of age and older, while zanamivir is approved for prophylaxis in persons five years of age and older. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are not substitutes for early vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the CDC. 3,4 Zanamivir should not be used for the prophylaxis or treatment of influenza in individuals with underlying airway disease.4 The neuraminidase inhibitors have been used off -label for the treatment and prophylaxis of avian influenza and Novel influenza A, H1N1.8 The adamantanes, amantadine and rimantadine , prevent viral replication by blocking the viral M2 protein ion channel, which prevents fusion of the virus and host -cell membranes.9,10 Amantadine and rimantadine , are active only against influenza A , not influenza B.1 Both amantadine and r imantadine are approved for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A.9,10 Due to a marked increase in resistant isolates, the A dvisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that adamantanes not be used in the U.S. for the treatment of influenza, except in selected circumstances.1 Amantadine was also found to have therapeutic value in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's disease in some patients.11 It is currently approved for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, parkinsonism and drug- induced extrapyramidal reactions.12 Its mechanism of action as a central nervous system agent is not established, but it is thought to block the reuptake of dopamine in presynaptic neurons and also to cause direct stimulation of postsynaptic receptors.13 It also blocks N -methyl -D-aspartate receptors, which may explain its role i n controlling dyskinesia.14 Amantadine is less effective than levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but that it has fewer associated extrapyramidal reactions than anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs.13 Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 2 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Medications Table 1. Medications Included Within Class Review Generic Name (Trade name) Medication Class Generic Availability Amantadine in at least one dosage form and/or strength. Antiviral resistance profiles for currently circulating influenza A and B viruses are listed below . Oseltamivir or zanamivir are the primary antiviral agents recommended for the prevention and treatment of influenza. Because currently circulating influenza A (H3N2) and 2009 H1N1 viruses are resistant to adamantanes, these medications are not recommended for use against influenza A infections. 15 Table 2: Antiviral Resistance Among Influenza Viruses Worldwide, December 2010 15 Antiviral Agent Influenza A Influenza B 2009 H1N1 H3N2 B Amantadine Resistant Resistant No Activity Oseltamivir Susceptible Susceptible Susceptible Rimantadine Resistant Resistant No Activity Zanamivir Susceptible Susceptible Susceptible Indications Table 3.

Clinical Trials The clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the influenza antivirals in Food and Drug Administration approved indications are outlined in Table 5.16-74 Overall, the agents in this class have demonstrated efficacy for their respective indications. Although the adamantanes have demonstrated efficacy against influenza A for both prophylaxis and treatment, increasing resistance has developed over the years and treatment guidelines no longer recommend their use for current strains of influenza.15 Oseltamivir and zanamivir have been effective in both the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A and B. Clinical trials have demonstrated reduced laboratory -confirmed influenza, decreased illness, fever duration, secondary complications, as well as a reduction in household contacts with influenza infection. 17- 20,22,27-29,31,33,37,38,40,43,46-48,52 -55,61 -63 Numerous placebo- controlled trials have demonstrated oseltamivir and zanamivir individually; however , head- to-head trials directly comparing the agents are limited. Kawai and colleagues compared oseltamivir to zanamivir for the treatment of both influenza A and B. Results demonstrated significantly shorter fever duration in patients with influenza B who were treated with zanamivir, compared to those treated with oseltamivir. 55 Limited within class comparisons prevent recommendation of one neuraminidase inhibitor over the other. Clinical trials have demonstrated that amantadine and rimantadine are also effective in both the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A; however, as mentioned previously, these agents are not recommended for the treatment of influenza and they should only be used in selected circumstances. 1,16,17,23 -26,30,32,54,56,62,64-66 With regard to Parkinson's disease, data from one clinical trial included in a meta- analysis demonstrated that patients receiving amantadine as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy for idiopathic Parkinson's disease achieved greater benefits in Parkinsonian symptoms severity scale scores and activity impairment scale scores compared to placebo. 67 Furthermore, for the treatment of drug- induced extrapyramidal reactions, amantadine has demonstrated efficacy in reducing dyskinesia frequency and severity, as well as motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease.68-74 Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 4 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Table 5.

The study authors concluded that the influenza attack rate in this study was too low to assess efficacy. In the experimental challenge study of influenza A/Beth/1/85, the prophylactic administration of 50, 100 or 200 mg/day was more effective compared to placebo in preventing influenza illness (66, 74 and 82% protection, respectively ; P<0.02 ), and in suppressing viral replication ( P=0.02). There was no significant difference between amantadine groups in influenza illness or viral shedding. Compared to the placebo group the 100 and 200 mg groups showed a significant decrease in infection rate (100 mg, 40% protection; P=0.012, 200 mg, 32% protection; P=0.045) did not (20% protection; P=0.187).

Of subjects vaccinated against influenza, oseltamivir was 91% effective in preventing laboratory -confirmed clinical influenza compared to placebo (0.5 vs 5.0%; P=0.003). Oseltamivir was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of secondary complications compared to placebo (0.4 vs 2.6%; P=0.037).

Thi s was calculated as a protective efficacy rate of 89% (95% CI, 67 to 97; P<0.001). For households with infected index contacts, the proportion of households with at least one subsequently infected contact were 3.6% for the oseltamivir group Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 6 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Resu lts contact proportion of influenza cases in the test population as a whole Secondary: Number of households with additional influenza -related illnesses compared to 22.8% for the placebo group. This was calculated as a protective efficacy rate of 84% (95% CI, 49 to 95; P<0.001). Data was also collected in cases where the index contact was not influenza as confirmed by laboratory tests, and in this group 0.4% of individuals taking oseltamivir came down with influenza from exposure in the community compared to 3.1% of individuals receiving placebo. Protective efficacy for these individuals exposed to influenza outside the household was calculated at 89% (95% CI, 10 to 99; P=0.009). Twenty -one of the clinical cases among the placebo recipients were infected with influenza A and 13 with influenza B. None of the clinical cases in the group of oseltamivir -treated contacts was infected with influenza A, so protective efficacy was not calculated. The protective efficacy against influenza B in contacts of all index contacts was calculated at 78.5% ( P=0.02). Secondary: Frequency of individuals shedding virus and therefore more likely to transmit to others was significantly reduced in oseltamivir recipients compared to placebo recipients. The protective efficacy in contacts of an influenza positive index contact was calculated at 84% (95% CI, 57 to 95; P<0.001). Hayden et al21 Oseltamivir 75 mg BID for 10 days (PEP) vs oseltam ivir 75 mg BID for 5 days at the time of developing illness (expectant treatment) PG, PRO, RCT Household contacts of index cases presenting with an influenza -like illness >1 year of age N=812 2000 to 2001 influenza season Primary: Secondary spread of influenza Secondary: Not reported Primary: PEP provided a protective efficacy of 58.5% (95% CI, 15.6 to 79.6; P=0.0114) for households against influenza and 68.0% (95% CI, 34.9 to 84.2; P=0.0017) for individual contacts, compared to treatment of index cases alone.

The protective efficacy of oseltamivir in the two active- treatment groups combined was 74% (95% CI, 53 to 88) at all the sites and 82% (95% CI, 60 to 93) at sites in Virginia, where the rate of influenza infection was higher than the overall rate. For culture- proven influenza, the rate of protective efficacy in the two oseltamivir groups combined was 87% (95% CI, 65 to 96). The rate of laboratory -confirmed influenza infection was lower with oseltamivir than with placebo (5.3 vs 10.6%; P<0.001). Secondary: Oseltamivir was well tolerated but was associated with a greater frequency of nausea (12.1 and 14.6% in the QD and BID groups, respectively) and vomiting (2.5 and 2.7%, respectively) than was placebo (nausea, 7.1%; vomiting, 0.8%). The frequency of premature discontinuation of drug or placebo was similar among the three groups (3.1 to 4.0 %). Brady et al (abstract)23 Rimantadine 100 mg QD for 6 weeks immediately after influenza A was detected in the community at each study site vs placebo DB, PC Adult patients 18 to 55 years of age from Baltimore and Columbus communities N=228 6 weeks Primary: Adverse event s, presence of influenza virus infection Secondary: Not reported Primary: Only 10 (8.7%) of the 114 rimantadine- treated subjects and five (4.4%) of 114 placebo- treated recipients reported one or more adverse event . The most frequently reported adverse event in both groups was related to the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. A total of seven rimantadine recipients and 20 placebo recipients developed influenza A infection, as documented by isolation of influenza A, a four-fold or greater rise in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer to influenza A (H3N2) in serum, or both (seven of 112 vs 20 of 110 participants, respectively; P<0.01). Influenza A/Leningrad/87- like (H3N2) virus was recovered from five placebo recipients but was not recovered from any of the rimantadine recipients. Altogether, 19 rimantadine recipients and 21 placebo recipients developed a respiratory illness during the study, but influenza A infection was documented in only 15 ill volunteers.

Clinical illness with laboratory evidence of influenza infection occurred in 24.1% of children in the placebo group and none of the children in the rimantadine group ( P=0.007). Secondary: Rimantadine was well -tolerated by the children, with no significant difference in reported adverse event s between the placebo and rimantadine groups. Hayden et al25 Rimantadine 200 mg QD for 10 days vs placebo DB, PC, RCT Household members of patients with influenza A N=237 (families) Two influenza seasons Primary: Development of illness and resistance Secondary: Not reported Primary: Among households with documented influenza A infections, symptomatic illness occurred in one or more contacts in 10 of 28 families treated with rimantadine and in 10 of 209 families treated with placebo. Asymptomatic secondary influenza A infections were found in five families assigned to receive rimantadine and in four families assigned to receive placebo. Rimantadine- resistant strains of influenza A (H3N2 subtype) with mutations consisting of single amino acid changes in the M2 protein (residue 27, 30, or 31) were recovered from eight index patients and five contacts treated with rimantadine. There was apparent transmission of drug -resistant strains of virus in six contacts with secondary illnesses in five families.

Participants in all three groups were equally likely to experience each of the specified symptoms. Efficacy analyses were carried out on 68 vaccinated residents of two nursing homes with demonstrated influenza activity. The administration of rimantadine at both dosages was associated with a decrease in the likelihood of clinical influenza- like illness and laboratory - confirmed influenza infection when compared to the administration of placebo, though no difference was statistically significant. No additional benefit of a 200 mg dose was observed compared to the 100 mg dose. When data for the 100 and 200 mg/day groups were combined and compared to data for the group receiving placebo, the efficacy of rimantadine in reducing the risk of clinical influenza -like illness was estimated to be 58% ( P=0.079).

Protective efficacy was similarly high for individuals (82%) and against both influenza types A and B (78 and 85%, respectively, for households). Zanamivir was well tolerated and was effective in preventing influen za types A and B within households where the index patient was not treated. Secondary: Not reported Monto et al29 Zanamivir 10 mg inhaled QD for 4 weeks vs placebo DB, PC, RCT Healthy adults 18 to 69 years of age N=1,107 1997 to1998 influenza season Primary: Laboratory - confirmed clinical influenza occurrence Secondary: Adverse event s Primary: Zanamivir was 67% efficacious (95% CI, 39 to 83; P<0.001) in preventing laboratory -confirmed clinical influenza meeting the case definition and 84% efficacious (95% CI, 55 to 94; P=0.001) in preventing laboratory -confirmed illnesses with fever. All influenza infections occurring during the season, with or without symptoms, were prevented with an efficacy of 31% (95% CI, 4 to 50; P=0.03).

Laboratory -documented influenza occurred in 21% of placebo recipients, 3% of rimantadine recipients and 2% of amantadine recipients ( P<0.001 for either drug vs placebo). These findings represent efficacy rates of 85% for rimantadine and 91% for amantadine, as compared to placebo. Secondary: More recipients of amantadine (13%) than recipients of rimantadine (6%; P<0.05) or placebo (4%; P<0.01) withdrew from the study because of central nervous system adverse events .

One trial demonstrated a nonsignificant preventative effect among healthy adults (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.08 to 2.03). Use of amantadine in healthy adults appeared to result in no difference in the incidence of acute respiratory illness between treatment groups. Use of oseltamivir in seasonal prophylaxi s Oseltamivir was efficacious against symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza in healthy adults (RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.51; pooled estimate from two trials reported as a single publication). A protective effect of oseltamivir against symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza was notable in one trial among frail elderly patients living in residential care (98% with concomitant disease) (RR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.63). Use of zanamivir in seasonal prophylaxis A protective efficacy of 68% with zanamivir in healthy adults was demonstrated in one trial (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.63; calculated by assessment group). Another trial demonstrated zanamivir to be efficacious in at-risk adolescent s and adults (RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.44), with a nons ignificant preventative effect in older adults with zanamivir vs 5/950 with placebo; RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.72). Use of amantadine in post -exposure prophylaxis One trial evaluating outbreak control in a boarding school setting demonstrated th at amantadine was effective in preventing symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza in healthy adolescents (RR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.34). In another trial, amantadine demonstrated protective efficacy (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.70) and ability to shorten the duration ( P<0.05) and severity ( P<0.01) of clinical influenza. Of note, the reporting of this trial was unclear.

Post -exposure proph ylaxis in pediatric patients at least one year of age was demonstrated to have a preventative effect against symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza in one trial (RR, 0.36; 95%, 0.15 to 0.84). Use of zanamivir in post -exposure prophylaxis Zanamivir was efficacious in preventing transmission of symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza in households of mixed composition (adults and children at least five years of age, unvaccinated adolescents and adults 13 to 65 years of age) based on three trials (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.33). Evidence for outbreak control in elderly adults in long term care was more limited, with a nonsignificant protective effect against symptomatic, laboratory - confirmed influenza demonstrated (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.27), w hereby all cases occurred in unvaccinated patients (calculated by assessment group). Secondary: No evidence relating to health- related quality of life or mortality was identified for amantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir. Use of amantadine in seasonal prophylaxis No secondary outcomes were described relating to the use of amantadine in seasonal prophylaxis. Use of oseltamivir in seasonal prophylaxis One trial demonstrated that oseltamivir was associated with a nonsignificant 78% relative reductions in secondary complications (no further details presented) among at -risk elderly adults with laboratory confirmed influenza (P=1.14). Use of zanamivir in seasonal prophylaxis Significantly less work absence was reported among patients receiving zanamivir vs control (mean hours lost, 0.6 vs 1.4; P=0.001). Total productive time lost was also less with zanamivir (1.8 vs 3.0 hours; P=0.001). Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 14 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Resu lts Use of amantadine in post -exposure prophylaxis Two trials provided limited evidence that identified milder influenza illness of shorter duration with the use of amantadine. The severity of symptoms was reported as 56% mild and 9% severe with amantadine , and 38% mild and 19% severe with placebo ( P<0.01 for severe symptoms, P<0.001 for mild symptoms). Mean duration of illness was shorter with amantadine compared to placebo ( P<0.05). Use of oseltamivir in post -exposure prophylaxis In one trial with a population of mixed composition (adults plus children at least one year of age), the proportion of contacts with laboratory conf irmed influenza with at least one secondary complication (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, otitis media, sinusitis) was equivalent among post -exposure patients and those receiving control who received expectant treatment upon the onset of influenza- like illness (7 vs 5%); however, the more severe respiratory complications (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia) occurred among the expectant treatment group. In this trial, the mean duration of illness in contacts was shorter with oseltami vir post -exposure prophylaxis vs those receiving treatment on influenza onset (5.5 vs 39.8 hours; P=0.103). Fewer contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza receiving oseltamivir post -exposure prophylaxis were bedbound compared to patients receiving treatment at influenza onset (7 vs 28%; P value not reported), demonstrating a milder form of disease. Use of zanamivir in post -exposure prophylaxis In one trial, significantly fewer households receiving zanamivir reported a contact developing a complication of laboratory confirmed influenza (2 vs 6%; P=0.01). In another trial, complications of symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza (adverse events consistent with complications of influenza among patients with symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza) during the first 28 days following post -exposure prophylaxis initiation were lower with zanamivir vs placebo (5 vs 6%; P=0.653). In a third trial, the proportion of cases with complications requiring antibiotics was lower with zanamivir compared to placebo (5 vs 8%; P value not reported). Furthermore, among household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza, the median time to alleviation of symptoms without use of medication was 5.5 and 8.0 days with zanamivir and Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 15 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Resu lts placebo ( P value not reported). In an other trial, mean duration of significant influenza -like symptoms was also observed to be shorter with zanamivir vs placebo (0.2 vs 0.6 days; P=0.016). No strong evidence for a higher incidence of adverse events in treatment groups compared to control was identified for amantadine, oseltamivir or zanamivir. Few serious drug- related adverse events and drug- related withdrawals were reported. Limited evidence was identified relating to the impact of vaccination status on the efficacy of amantadine prophylaxis. The protective efficacy of oseltamivir in elderly adults in seasonal prophylaxis when analyzed among vaccinated patients only was found to be comparable with the protective efficacy among the trial population as a whole (protective efficacies of 91 and 92%, respectively). In one trial, overall the use of zanamivir in seasonal prophylaxis in healthy adults (18 to 64 years of age) yielded a 68% (95% CI, 37 to 83) protective efficacy against symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza. Among unvaccinated patients, the protective efficacy appeared to be lower (60%; 95% CI, 24 to 80). In another trial, for the use of zanamivir in seasonal prophylaxis in at -risk a dults and adolescents, comparable effects were observed, with RRs of 0.17 (95% CI, 0.02 to 1.41) and 0.17 (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.58) of developing symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively. Of the cases of symptomatic, laboratory -confirmed influenza that were observed in another trial of zanamivir in outbreak control, all occurred in unvaccinated patients. No evidence of reduced sensitivity to tested viral isolates to oseltamivir or zanamivir was obtained in included trials. None of the amantadine prophylaxis trials included reported the assessment of sensitivity of influenza isolates to amantadine.

Hayden et al41 Rimantadine 200 mg QD for 5 days vs placebo DB, PC, RCT Culture- proven influenza A infection caused by an A/Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2) -like virus; treatment was started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms N=14 5 days Primary: Viruses in nasal secretions Secondary: Maximal daily temperatures in influenza A (H3N2) infected students, duratio n of temperature, systemic and respiratory illness symptom scores Primary: Rimantadine recipients had a prompt reduction in virus titers by treatment day two and had significantly lower titers than did placebo recipients on days two through four. During treatment days two through five, 23 of the 24 (96%) specimens from placebo recipients yielded the virus, compared to 16 of the 26 (62%) rimantadine recipients ( P<0.01). Secondary: Rimantadine- treated patients defervesced rapidly and had significantly lower mean maximum temperatures on treatment days two and three. On treatment day three, all seven rimantadine recipients were afebrile (with a maximum oral temperature 99\u00b0F), compared to none of the seven placebo recipients (P<0.01).

This 1.5 day benefit was also seen for influenza- positive patients (4.5 vs 6.0 days; P=0.004). In patients who were febrile and received zanamivir, symptoms were decreased two days earlier than in those who received placebo ( P<0.001) in the intention- to-treat and influenza- positive patient groups. Influenza- positive patients treated with zanamivir had significantly less severe symptoms overall on days one to14 than those on placebo ( P<0.05). High-risk patients had significantly fewer complications than those on placebo (P=0.004) and fewer high risk patients needed antibiotic medication to treat those complications ( P=0.025). Secondary: When zanamivir recipients were compared to patients on placebo, return to norm al activities, sleep disturbances, complication rates, and associated use of antibiotics were all less in the intention- to-treat and influenza- positive populations, but the differences were not significant.

Treatment with oseltamivir at either 75 or 150 mg BID resulted in statistically significant reductions ( P<0.001 and P=0.006, respectively) in the area under the curve analysis of total symptom scores which reflects the severity and duration of illness. There were no differences between the two doses of oseltamivir with regard to effects. The 75 and 150 mg doses of oseltamivir reduced the severity of illness compared to placebo by 38 and 35%, respectively ( P<0.001 for both). Secondary: Duration of cough was reduced from a median of 55 hours in the placebo group to 31 hours (43% reduction) in the 75 mg group and to 40 hours (27% reduction) in the 150 mg group. The duration of myalgia was also reduced, from a median of 28 hours in the placebo group to 16 hours (42% reduction) in the 75 mg group and 19 hours (32% reduction) in the 150 mg group. After 24 hours of treatment, median viral titers had decreased by 1.2 logs in the placebo group vs 1.7 and 2.0 logs in the 75 and 150 mg oseltamivir groups, respectively.

Thereafter, the mean scores were not significantly different. Eighty -nine percent of observed reduction in fever occurred in the first 24 hours in the rimantadine group compared to 60% in the acetaminophen group. The mean peak temperature in the rimantadine group on day three was 37.3\u00b0C vs 37.8\u00b0C in the acetaminophen group ( P<0.04). Of those in the rimantadine group, 86% had peak temperatures <38\u00b0C in comparison to 66% in the acetaminophen group. The mean score for severity of illness was significantly less on day four (P<0.04) for the rimantadine treated patients. The proportion of children shedding the influenza virus on the second day of therapy was significantly reduced in the rimantadine group on day two (P=0.006). However, on days five, six, and seven, the percentage of patients shedding the virus in the rimantadine group increased in contrast to a continued decrease in the acetaminophen group; the difference was significant on day six ( P=0.05) and seven ( P=0.02). An initial decrease in quantity of virus shed in the nasal lavage specimens in the rimantadine group was observed on day two ( P=0.03), followed by a significant increase in comparison to acetaminophen treated patients on day seven ( P=0.03). The duration of viral shedding in those receiving rimantadine was 5.6 days compared to 4.5 days for those receiving a cetaminophen ( P<0.04).

At six months, one study found a reduction in risk for stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients <65 years who received oseltamivir (HR, 0.66; 95% CI , 0.56 to 0.77). Oseltamivir was not associated with fewer complications, such as pneumonia (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.16) or any recurrent cardiovascular outcome (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.10); however, there was a reduction in otitis media (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.87) . The incidence of resistance to oseltamivir treatment across five studies was 30 per 1000 patients (95% CI, 10 to 60) and influenza virus was detectable in 330 per 1000 patients (95% CI, 280 to 370) approximately five days after treatment with oseltamivir. No study compared the persistence of influenza virus between patients who received oseltamivir and those who did not. There was no significant reduction in hospitalization following inhaled zanamivir treatment compared to those who receive no antiviral therapy (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.18). Zanamivir reduced the duration of symptoms by approximately 23 hours (95% CI, 17 to 28) on the basis of a large SMD ( -0.94; 9% CI, -1.21 to -0.66). There was risk of includin g otitis media (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.67 to respiratory disease (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.39). The combined results of five Japanese studies in patients with confirmed influenza suggest that inhaled zanamivir may be associated with slightly shorter symptom duration than oseltamivir (difference, 7 hours; 95% CI, 2 to 12). There was no statistically significant difference between oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir with regard to hospitalizations (OR, 1.40 ; 95% CI, 0.45 to 4.35) or ICU admissions (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.16 to 2.18) in pregnant women.

The duration of fever was significantly shortened by amantadine compared to placebo (0.99 days; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.26). However, there was no effect on nasal shedding of influenza A viruses in the upper airways after up to five days of treatment (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.27).

Clinical Guidelines Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report : Prevention and Control of Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( 2012) 75 In 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) f irst recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons six months of age and older in the United States. Vaccination of all persons six months of age and older continues to be recommended. The 2012 -2013 United Sates influenza vaccines A(H3N2) and B antigens differ from the respective 2010- 2011 and 2011- 2012 seasonal vaccine antigens. The influenza A(H1N 1) vaccine virus strain is derived from an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009 [H1N1]) virus and was included in the 2009 (H1N1) monovalent pandemic vaccine as well as the 2010 -2011 and 2011- 2012 seasonal vaccines. Recommendations for vaccination Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons six months of age and older. Vaccination should optimally occur before onset of influenza activity in the community, and providers should offer vaccination as soon as vaccine is available. Vaccination also should continue to be offered throughout the influenza season. Vaccine doses for children aged six months through eight years Children aged six months through eight years require two doses of influenza vaccine (administered a minimum of four weeks apart) during their first season of vaccination . Children who last received seasonal (trivalent) influenza vaccine before the 2010- 2011 season but did not receive a vaccine containing 2009 (H1N1) antigen (either seasonal vaccine since July 2010 or monovalent 2009 [H1N1] vaccine) will not have received this antigen. These children should receive two doses this season, even if two doses of seasonal influenza vaccine were received prior to the 2010- 2011 season. Available products Multiple influenza vaccines are e xpected to be available during the Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 57 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) 2012 -2013 season. Trivalent inactivated TIV) preparations, the exception of Fluzone Intradermal\u00ae, should be administered intramuscularly, with the deltoid as preferred site for adults and older children, and anterolateral thigh for infants and younger children. For intramuscular TIV preparations, children aged six through 35 months receive 0.25 mL per dose and per sons aged 36 months receive 0.5 mL per dose. Fluzone Intradermal\u00ae is administered intradermally via a single- dose, prefilled microinjection syringe. The preferred site for administration is over the deltoid muscle. All TIV preparations contain the same quantity of hemagglutinin (15 \u00b5g per vaccine virus strain per 0.5 mL dose; 45 \u00b5g total), except Fluzone Intradermal\u00ae and Fluzone High- Dose\u00ae. Fluzone Intradermal\u00ae is indicated for persons aged 18 to 64 years and contains 9 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin per vaccine virus strain (27 \u00b5g total) in a 0.1 mL dose. Fluzone High- Dose\u00ae is indicated for persons aged 65 years and contains 60 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin per vaccine virus strain (180 \u00b5g total) in a 0.5 mL dose. Within specified age indications, there is no preference for any TIV formulation over another. The intranasally administered live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) FluMist \u00ae is indicated for healthy, nonpregnant persons aged two to 49 years. No preference is indicated for the use of LAIV compared to TIV for the indicated age group. Persons with a history of egg allergy should receive TIV rather than LAIV. Persons who care for severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protective environment should not receive LAIV given the theoretical risk for transmission of the live- attenuated vaccine virus. Febrile pneumococcal conjugate ( PCV13) Due to reports of an increased risk for fever and febrile seizures in young children in Australia associated with a 2010 S outhern Hemisphere vaccine, Afluria \u00ae is not recommended for use in the United States for children less than nine years old . Surveillance for United States -licensed influenza vaccines during the 2010- 2011 season detected safety signals for febrile seizures in young children after TIV administration. Further assessment determined that the increased risk was in children six months to four years of age. The risk was higher when children received concomitant PCV13 and peaked at approximately age 16 months. No increased risk was observed in children aged five years of age or older after TIV or in children of any age after LAIV. The magnitude of the increased risk for febrile seizures in young c hildren in the United States (less than one case per 1,000 children vaccinated) was substantially lower than the risk observed in Australia in 2010. After evaluating data on febrile seizures from 2010 -2011 influenza season, no policy change was recommended for use of TIV or PCV13 for the 2011- 2012 season. S urveillance data on febrile seizures in young children after administration of influenza vacci ne for the 2011- 2012 influenza season were consistent with those from the 2010 -2011 influenza season . No changes in the use of TIV or PCV13 are Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 58 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) recommended for the 2012 -2013 influenza season. Influenza vaccination of persons with a history of egg allergy All currently available influenza vaccines are prepared by inoculation of virus into chicken eggs. Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine, with the following additional safety measures : o TIV rather than LAIV should be used. o Vaccine should be administered by a health care provider familiar with the potential manifestations of egg allergy. o Vaccine recipients should be observed for 30 minutes for signs of a reaction after administration of each vaccine dose. Persons with reactions to egg involving angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, particularly those that occurred immediately or within a short time (minutes to hours) after egg exposure, are more likely to have a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction upon reexposure to egg proteins. Before receipt of vaccine, such persons should be referred to a physician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions for further risk assessment , All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment for rapid recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis are available. Some persons who report allergy to egg might not be egg- allergic. Those who are able to eat lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled egg) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic. Egg- allergic persons might tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., bread or cake). Tolerance to egg-containing foods does not exclude the possibility of egg allergy. Egg allergy can be confirmed by a consistent medical history of adverse reactions to eggs and egg- containing foods, plus skin and/or blood testing for immunoglobulin E antibodies to egg proteins. Previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine, regardless of the component suspected to be responsible for the reaction, is a contraindication to future receipt of the vaccine. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines All currently available influenza vaccines are trivalent and contain A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B viral antigens. There are two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses referred to as Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Immunization against B virus strains of one lineage provides limited cross- protection against strains in the other lineage. Because of this and the difficulty of predicting which B virus lineage will predominate during a given season, inclusion of a second influenza B vaccine virus strain in seasonal influenza vaccines has been proposed. In February 2012, FDA approved a new seasonal quadrivalent LAIV, FluMist Quadrivalent \u00ae. This vaccine currently is not anticipated to be available until the 2013- 2014 influenza season, at which time it is expected to replace the currently available seasonal trivalent FluMist\u00ae formulation. Inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccines currently are in Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 59 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) development. American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases: Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Influenza in Children, 2012- 2013 (2012) 76 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual trivalent seasonal influenza immunization for all children and adolescents six months of age and older during the 2012- 2013 influenza season. Healthy children two years of age and older can receive either TIV or LAIV. The focus should be on administration of TIV for all children and adolescents who have underlying medical conditions associated with an increased risk of complications from influenza, including: o Asthma or other chronic pulmonary diseases including cystic fibrosis. o Cardiac disease. o Hemodynamically significant cardiac disease. o Immunosuppressive disorders or therapy. o HIV infection. o Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies . o Diseases that require long- term aspirin therapy, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Kawasaki disease. o Chronic renal dysfunction. o Chronic metabolic disease including diabetes mellitus. o Any condition that can compromise respiratory function or handling of secretions or can increase the risk of aspiration, such as neurodevelopmental disorders, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders or neuromuscular abnormalities. o All household contacts and out -of-home care providers of children with high- risk conditions or children younger than five years of age. o All health care personnel. o All women w ho are pregnant, considering pregnancy, or breastfeeding during the influenza season. o Close contacts of immunosuppressed people. Use of antiviral medications The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are the only antiviral medications routinely recommended for chemoprophylaxis or treatment during the 2012- 2013 season. High levels of resistance to amantadine and rimantadine persist, and these drugs should not be used in the upcoming season unless resistance patterns change significantly. Treatment should be offered for any child hospitalized with presumed influenza or with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, regardless of influenza immunization status, or for influenza infection of any severity in children at high risk of complications of influenza infection. Treatment should be considered for any otherwise healthy child with influenza infection for whom a decrease in duration of clinical symptoms is felt to be warranted by his or her provider if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Earlier treatment provides more optimal clinical response. Treatment after 48 hours of symptoms in a child with moderate to severe or progressive disease is likely to provide some benefit. Chemoprophylaxis should be provided to: o Children at high risk of complications from influenza for whom influenza vaccine is contraindicated. Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 60 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) o Children at high risk during the two weeks after influenza immunization. o Family members or health care personnel who are unimmunized and are likely to have ongoing, close exposure to unimmunized children at high risk, or infants and toddlers who are younger than 24 months. o Control of influenza outbreaks for unimmunized staff and children in a closed institutional setting with children at high risk. o As a supplement to immunization among children at high risk, including children who are immunocompromised and might not respond to vaccine. o As post -exposure prophylaxis for family members and close contacts of an infected person if those people are at high risk of complications from influenza. o Children at high risk and their family members and close contacts as well as health care providers when circulating strains of influenza virus in the community are not matched with trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine strains. Chemoprophylaxis should not be considered a substitute for immunization. Influenza vaccine should always be offered when not contraindicated, even when influenza virus is circulating in the community. Antiviral medications currently licensed are important adjuncts to influenza immunization for control and prevention of influenza disease, but there are toxicities associated with antiviral agents and indiscriminate use mi ght limit availability. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Antiviral Agents for the Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (2011) 15 Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing seasonal influenza virus infection and its complications. Antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for: o Patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness or who require hospitalization. o Outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are at higher risk for influenza complications on the basis of their age or underlying medical conditions . Persons at higher risk for influenza complications recommended for antiviral treatment include: o Children less than two years of age . o Adults aged 65 years. o Persons with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury). o Persons with immunosuppression, including t hat caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec tion. o Women who are pregnant or postpartum (within two weeks Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 61 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) after delivery). o Persons aged <19 years who are receiving long- term aspirin therapy. o American Indians/Alaska Natives. o Persons who are morbidly obese (i.e., body -mass index 40). o Residents of nursing homes and other chronic -care facilities. Four licensed prescription influenza antiviral agents are available in the United States: active agai nst both influenza A and B. Rimantadine and amantadine are only active against influenza A. Recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir and zanamivir. Greater than 99% of currently circulating influenza virus strains are sensitive to these medications. Amantadine and rimantadine should not be used because of the high levels of resistance to these drugs. Local antiviral resistance surveillance data should be monitored. Currently circulating influenza A (H3N2) and 2009 H1N1 viruses are resistant to adamantanes. These medications are not recommended for use against influenza A virus infections. Oseltamivir may be used for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza among infants less than one year of age when indicated. Antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for all persons with suspected or confirmed influenza requiring hospitalization or who have progressive, severe or complicated illness regardless of previous health or vaccination status. The greatest benefit is when initiated within 48 hours of influenza onset. However, it may be beneficial in those with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients if administered >48 hours from onset. Health- care providers and patients should make this decision on an individual basis. Randomized, controlled trials conducted primarily among per sons with mild illness in outpatient settings have demonstrated that zanamivir or oseltamivir can reduce the duration of uncomplicated influenza A and B illness by approximately one day when administered within 48 hours of illness onset compared to placebo. Data are limited about the effectiveness of zanamivir and oseltami vir treatment in preventing serious influenza- related complications. Chemoprophylaxis with antiviral medications is not a substitute for influenza vaccination when influenza vaccine is available. Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis lowers but does not eliminate the risk for influenza. Susceptibility to influenza returns once the antiviral medication is stopped, and influenza vaccination is rec ommended. Duration should be for a total of no more than 10 days after the most recent known exposure to a close contact known to have influenza. Pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis must be administered for the duration of time when exposure might occur and should only be used for persons who are at very high risk for influenza- related complications who cannot otherwise be protected during times when a high risk for exposure exists. The duration of pre- exposure chemoprophylaxis based on potential exposure in the community depends on the duration of community influenza activity. Zanamivir is approved for treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute illness caused by influenza A or B virus, and for chemoprophylaxis of influenza among ad ults. It is also approved for treatment of influenza Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 62 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) among children seven years of age and older and for chemopro phylaxis of influenza among children five years of age and older . Oseltamivir is approved for treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute ill ness caused by influenza A or B virus and for chemoprophylaxis of influenza among adults. It is also approved for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza among children one year of age and older . Rimantadine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for children one year of age and older and for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of only influenza A virus infections among adults. Use of rimantadine among children less than one year of age has not been evaluated adequately. Oseltamivir, zanamivir, and rimantadine are \"Pregnancy Category C\" medications. Oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of pregnant women. 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) In the post -pandemic period, 2009 H1N1 virus strains now are considered to be the predominant seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus strains. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the most accurate and sensitive test for detecting influ enza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 virus. Epidemiologic studies of seasonal influenza or 2009 H1N1 suggest that persons at higher risk for influenza complications include: o Children less than five years of age (especially those less than two years of age ). o Adults aged 65 years. o Persons with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovas - cular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematologic (including sickle cell disease), metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability (mental retardation), moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury). o Persons with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection. o Women who are pregnant or postpartum (within two weeks after delivery). o Persons aged 18 years who are receiving long- term aspirin therapy. o American Indians/Alaska Natives. o Persons who are morbidly obese (i.e., body mass index 40). o Residents of nursing homes and other chronic -care facilities. Studies conducted during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic indicate that viral shedding, clinical illness, and transmissibility in a household setting are similar compared to seasonal influenza. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the clinical syndrome most likely to be the cause of hospitalization was diffuse viral pneumoni tis, which in some instances led to shock and respiratory failure. Influenza complications among children during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic were generally similar to those observed among Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 63 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) children with seasonal influenza. However, much higher rates of illness among children observed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic compared to most influe nza seasons resulted in much higher rates of children hospitalized with complications. Circulating 2009 H1N1 virus strains are resistant to adamantanes. These are not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended empiric neuraminidase inhibitor treatment for all persons with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 virus infection that are at increased risk for influenza complications. Similar recommendations were made by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the subse- quent 2009- 2010 influenza season. Oseltamivir or zanamivir is recommended for antiviral chemoprophylaxis of 2009 H1N1. Those with a potential exposure to a person with laboratory -confirmed 2009 H1N1 should rec eive chemoprophylaxis. Sporadic oseltamivir -resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infections have been identified. Transmission of oseltamivir -resistant influenza B virus strains or 2009 H1N1 virus strains acquired from persons treated with oseltamivir is rare but has been documented. Nearly all sporadic cases of oseltamivir -resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infections identified to date also have been associated with the H275Y mutation in neuraminidase; these oseltamivir -resistant H275Y virus infections are susceptible to zanamivir. Intravenous zanamivir is the recommended antiviral treatment for severely ill patients with highly suspected or confirmed oseltamivir - resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infection. As of December 2010, no evidence existed of ongoing transmission of oseltam ivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus strains worldwide. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, recommendations for oseltamivir dosing of children less than one year of age were developed, on the basis of very limited pharmacokinetic data. The Emergency Use Authorization issued during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic for this indication expired on June 23, 2010, but recommendations on dosing for children less than one year of age are available. CDC recommends that clinicians who treat children aged three to 11 months administer 3 mg/kg/dose twice per day for treatment, and 3 mg/kg/dose once per day for chemoprophylaxis. Infants less than three months of age are recommended to receive 3 mg/kg/dose twice per day for treatment. However, chemoprophylaxis for infants less than three months of age is not recommended unless the exposure situation was judged to be critical, because of a lack of data on use of oseltamivir on this age group. WHO subsequently recommended that children aged <14 days who are being treated for suspected or confirmed influenza receive 3 mg/kg/dose once daily. Lower doses should be considered for infants who are not receiving regular oral feedings or those who have substantially reduced renal function . Infectious Diseases Society of America: Antivirals for treatment Treatment is recommended for adults and childr en with influenza virus Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 64 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) Seasonal Influenza in Adults and Children - Diagnosis, Treatment, Chemoprophylaxis, and Institutional Outbreak Management: Clinical Practices Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (2009) 77 infection who meet the following criteria: o Patients with laboratory -confirmed or highly susceptible influenza virus infection at high risk for developing complications within 48 hours after symptom onset. Treatment is recommended regardless of influenza vaccination status and severity of illness. o Patients requiring hospitalization for laboratory -confirmed or highly suspected influenza illness, regardless of underlying illness or influenza vaccination status, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours after onset of symptoms. Treatment should be considered for adults and children with influenza virus infection who meet the following criteria: o Outpatients at high risk of complications, with illness that is not improving and with a p ositive influenza test result from a specimen obtained >48 hours after symptom onset. o Outpatients with laboratory -confirmed or highly suspected influenza virus infection who are not at increased risk for complications, whose symptom onset is <48 hours bef ore presentation and who wish to shorten the duration of illness and to further reduce their relatively low risk of complications or who are in close contact with persons at high risk of complications secondary to influenza infection. Patients at high risk for complications from influenza include: o Unvaccinated infants 12 to 24 months old. o Patients with asthma or other chronic pulmonary diseases. o Patients with hemodynamically significant cardiac disease. o Patients who have immunosuppressive disorders or who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy. o HIV infected patients. o Patients with sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies. o Patients with diseases requiring long term aspirin therapy. o Patients with chronic renal dysfunction. o Patients with cancer. o Patient s with chronic metabolic disease. o Patients with neuromuscular disorders, seizure disorders or cognitive dysfunction that may compromise the handling of respiratory secretions. o Patients 65 years old. o Residents of any age in nursing homes or other long term care institutions. On the basis of antiviral susceptibility patterns current as of March 2009: o Influenza A (H1N1) virus infections should be treated with either zanamivir or an adamantine (preferably rimantadine due to a more tolerable adverse event profile). Oseltamivir should not be used. o Influenza A (H3N2) virus infections should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir. The adamantanes should not be used. o If subtype information is unavailable, influenza A should be treated with either zanamivir or combination oseltamivir and rimantadine therapy. o Influenza B virus infection should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir. Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 65 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) Antivirals for chemoprophylaxis Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is not a substitute for influenza vaccination, which is the primary tool to prevent influenza. When influenza viruses are circulating in the community, chemoprophylaxis can be considered for high risk patients during the two weeks after vaccination before an adequate immune response to inactivated vaccine develops. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be considered for adults and children at least one year old who are at high risk of developing complications from influenza for whom influenza vaccination is contraindicated, unavailable or expected to have low effectiveness. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis, in conjunction with prompt administration of the inactivated vaccine, should be considered for adults and children at least one year old who are at high risk of developing complications from influenza virus infection and have not yet received influenza vaccine when influenza activity has already been detected in the community. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis may be considered for unvaccinated adults, includi ng health care workers, and for children at least one year old who are in close contact with patients at high risk of developing influenza complications during periods of influenza activity. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all residents, vaccinated and unvaccinated, in institutions (i.e., nursing homes, long term care facilities) that are experiencing influenza outbreaks. The strongest consideration for use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be given to patients at the highest risk of influenza -associated complications. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be considered for patients at high risk of developing complications from influenza if influenza vaccine is not available due to a shortage. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis can be considered for high risk patients in situations where there is documented low influenza vaccine clinical effectiveness because of the circulation of influenza virus strains that are antigenically distant from the vaccine strains. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be initiated at the onset of sustained community influenza activity in patients at high risk of complications who are not adequately protected as a result of poor immune response, lack of influenza vaccination or ineffective vaccine. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis use for appropriate persons within households should be initiated when one family member develops suspected or confirmed influenza and any other family member is at high risk of complications secondary to infection, including infants less than six months old. o In this setting, all non- infected family members should receive antiviral chemoprophylaxis. o All eligible family members in this settings should be vaccinated, making chemoprophylaxis unnecessary. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis and other control measures should be initiated in institutions when an influenza outbreak is detected or when influenza is strongly suspected but the etiology of the outbreak is unknown. If inactivated influenza vaccine is administered, antiviral chemoprophylaxis can generally be sto pped after two weeks for Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 66 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) patients in non -institutional settings. At least six weeks of chemoprophylaxis will be required for children less than nine years of age. When antiviral chemoprophylaxis is used in a household after the diagnosis of influenza in one family member, chemoprophylaxis should be continued for 10 days. In patients at high risk for complications from influenza for whom influenza vaccination is contraindicated, unavailable or expected to have low effectiveness, chemoprophylaxis should continue for the duration that influenza viruses are circulating in the community during influenza season. On the basis of antiviral susceptibility patterns current as of March 2009: o For influenza A (H1N1), zanamivir or an adamantine (preferably rimantadine due to a more tolerable adverse event profile) should be used for chemoprophylaxis. Oseltamivir should not be used. o For influenza A (H3N2), oseltamivir or zanamivir should be used for chemoprophylaxis. The adamantanes should not be used. o If subtype infor mation is unavailable, either zanamivir or combination oseltamivir and rimantadine therapy should be used for influenza A chemoprophylaxis. o Oseltamivir or zanamivir should be used for influenza B chemoprophylaxis. Outbreak management in institutional settings All residents with laboratory -confirmed influenza virus infection should be treated with an appropriate influenza antiviral medication. After one case of laboratory -confirmed influenza, all patients in the facility subsequently developing influenza- like illness should be considered for treatment. During documented outbreaks of influenza in long term care facilities, all resident should receive influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis, regardless of influenza vaccination status. For all institutional e mployees who are unable to receive influenza vaccine or for whom vaccine is contraindicated or expected to be ineffective, antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be administered. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be continued for 14 days or for seven days after the onset of symptoms in the last person infected, whichever is longer. World Health Organization Rapid Advice Guideline Panel on Avian Influenza: World Health Organization Rapid Advice Guidelines for Pharmacological Management of Sporadic Human Infectio n with Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Clinicians should administer oseltamivir treatment as soon as possible in patients with confirmed or strongly suspected H5N1 infection (strong recommendation, very low quality evidence). Clinicians might administer zanamivir in patients with confirmed or strongly suspected infection with H5N1 virus (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). Clinicians should not administer amantadine or rimantadine alone as first-line treatment to patients with confirmed or strongly suspected human infection with H5N1 if neuraminidase inhibitors are available (strong recommendation, very low quality evidence). Clinicians might administer amantadine or rimantadine as a first -line treatment to patients with confirmed or strongly suspected infection with Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 67 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) Virus (2007)78 H5N1 if neuraminidase inhibitors are not available and especially if the virus is known or likely to be susceptible (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). Clinicians might administer a combination of a neuraminidase inhibitor and amantadine or rimantadine to patients with confirmed or strongly suspected infection with H5N1 if neuraminidase inhibitors are available and especially if the virus is known or likely to be susceptible (weak recommendation, very low qual ity evidence). Oseltamivir or zanamivir should be administered as chemoprophylaxis continuing for seven to 10 days after the last known exposure in high-risk exposure groups (strong recommendation, very low quality evidence). Oseltamivir or zanamivir might be administered as chemoprophylaxis continuing for seven to 10 days after the last known exposure in moderate- risk exposure groups (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). Oseltamivir or zanamivir should probably not be administered as chemoproph ylaxis in low -risk exposure groups (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). Amantadine or rimantadine should not be administered as chemoprophylaxis against human infection with H5N1 if the virus is known or likely to be resistant (strong recommendation, very low quality evidence). Amantadine or rimantadine might be administered as chemoprophylaxis against human infection with H5N1 in high or moderate- risk exposure groups if neuraminidase inhibitors are not available and especially if the virus is known or likely to be susceptible (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). Amantadine or rimantadine should probably not be administered as chemoprophylaxis against human infection with H5N1 virus in low -risk exposure groups if neuraminidase inhibitors are not available and even if the virus is known or likely to be susceptible (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). Infectious Diseases Society of America/ American Thoracic Society: Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Community -Acquired Pneumonia in Adults (2007) 79 General recommendations Selection of antimicrobial regimens for empirical therapy is based on prediction of the most likely pathogens(s) and knowledge of local susceptibility patterns. Once the etiology of community acquired pneumonia has been identified via microbiological testing, antimicrobial therapy should be directed at that pathogen. Empiric therapy - outpatient treatment For previously healthy patients with no risk factors for drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) can be used. Doxycycline may also be an alternate option. A respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, or levofloxacin) is the treatment option in regions with a high rate of macrolide -resistant S pneumoniae, or for patients with comorbidities, such as chronic heart, lung, liver or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancies; asplenia; immunosuppressive conditions or use of immunosuppressive drugs. Fluoroquinolones may also be used for patients who have used antimicrobials within the previous three Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 68 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) months. Other preferred options for these patients would be the combination of a -lactam (ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) plus Empiric therapy - inpatient, non -intensive care unit treatment A respiratory fluoroquinolone or a combination of a -lactam plus a macrolide is recommended. Preferred -lactam agents include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin; ertapenem may also be used for selected patients. A respiratory fluoroquinolone should be used for penicillin allergic patients. Empiric therapy - inpatient, intensive care unit treatment A -lactam (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin/sulbactam) plus either azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. For penicillin -allergic patients, a respiratory fluoroquinolone and aztreonam are recommended. antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal -lactams listed above can also be used with either an aminoglycoside and azithromycin, or an aminoglycoside and an antipneumococcal f luoroquinolone. For penicillin -allergic patients, substitute aztreonam for the above - lactam for Pseudomonas infection. Pathogen- directed therapy S pneumonia (penicillin non -resistant) - penicillin G or amoxicillin preferred; a respiratory fluoroquinolone. S pneumonia (penicillin resistant) - agents chosen based on susceptibility; alternative agents include vancomycin, linezolid and high- dose amoxicillin (3 g/day). Haemophilus influenza Yersinia pestis streptomycin, gentamicin recommend ed; alternative Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 69 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) agents include (inhalation) levofloxacin, doxycycline preferred (usually alternative include other fluoroquinolones, rifampin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, -lactam if susceptible. carbapenem; alternative agents include cefazolin and clindamycin. S aureus (methicillin resistant) - vancomycin or linezolid preferred; alternative agent is preferred. tuberculosis isoniazid plus rifampin plus ethambutol plus pyrazinamide preferred. Coccidioides species - no therapy generally recommended in normal host for uncomplicated infection; if therapy desired, itraconazole or fluconazole agent is amphotericin B. Suspected H1N1 pandemic influenza should be treated with oseltamivir and antibacterial agents targeting S pneumonia and S aureus. American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter: Initiation of Treatment for Parkinson's Disease: An Evidence Based Review (2002) 80 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who require symptomatic treatment, may be started with selegiline prior to the administration of dopaminergic therapy. Selegiline has mild symptomatic benefits in PD, and no convincing evidence of neuroprotective benefits. Levodopa, cabergoline, ropinirole and pramipexole are effective in ameliorating motor complications and impairment in the activities of daily living in patients with PD who require dopaminergic therapy. Of these agents, levodopa is more effective in treating motor complications and activities of daily living disability and is associated with a higher incidence of dyskinesias than dopamine agonists. Levodopa or a dopamine agonist may be initiated in patients with PD who require dopaminergic therapy. Cabergoline, ropinirole and pramipexole resulted in fewer motor Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 70 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) complications (i.e., wearing off, dyskinesias, on -off fluctuations) compared to levodopa. Treatment with a dopamine agonist was associated with more frequent adverse drug reactions (hallucinations, somnolence and edema in the lower extremities) than levodopa. When initiating treatment with levodopa in patients with PD, either an immediate- release or sustained- release formulation may be used. In clinical trials, there was no difference in the rate of motor complications between the two formulations. American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter: Treatment of Parkinson's Disease with Motor Fluctuations and Dyskinesia (2006) 81 Rasagiline and entacapone demonstrated statistically significant reduction in off time as compared to placebo in clinical trials. It is recommended that these two agents should be offered to reduce off - time. Pergolide demonstrated some improvement in the reduction in off -time as compared to placebo in clinical trials. However, a large number of patients on pergolide experienced more dyskinesias. Pramipexole demonstrated some reduction in off -time in placebo controlled trials. Ropinirole and tolcapone showed reduction in off -time compared to placebo. It is recommended that pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole and tolcapone can be considered to reduce off -time. Due to adverse events and the strength of the studies, entacapone and rasagiline are preferred Apomorphine, cabergoline and selegiline were studied in clinical trials that lacked proper enrollment and met hods to provide conclusive evidence of reducing off -time. It is recommended that these agents may be considered to reduce off -time. Bromocriptine and extended- release carbidopa/levodopa do not help to reduce off -time. Amantadine is possibl y effective in r educing dyskinesia and has demonstrated reduction in dyskinesia compared to placebo in clinical trials. It is recommended that amantadine may be considered for patients with PD for reducing dyskinesias. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus may be considered as a treatment option in PD patients to help improve motor function and to reduce motor fluctuations, dyskinesias and medication usage. American Academy of Neurology: Practice Parameter: Neuroprotective Strategies and Alternative Therapie s for Parkinson Disease (an Evidence -based Review): Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (2006) 82 Therapies that can slow the progression of PD Neuroprotection has the potential to delay the decline of motor symptoms and preserve quality of life. Currently, the measurement of neurons can only be done postmortem; therefore, surrogate clinical markers (e.g., ratings of motor impairment, general disability, quality of life measures, time to a specific event such as delay for the initiation of symptomatic therapy; motor fluctuation or death) that are thought to reflect nigrostriatal neuron counts need to be employed. Because none of the surrogate markers have been validated, cautious interpretation of clinical trials is required. Treatment with 2,000 units of vitamin E should not be considered for neuroprotection. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of the following agents for be considered for initial treatment (nine months) as it does not accelerate disease progression and is safe; however, there is no long term evidence to recommend its use for neuroprotection. Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 71 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of selegiline for neuroprotection. Nonstandard pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies that have been shown to improve motor function in PD Use of complementary medication and treatment is common in patients with PD. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of Mucuna pruriens for the treatment of motor symptoms. Vitamin E (2,000 units) should not be considered for symptomatic treatment. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture in PD. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of the following therapies for the treatment of PD: manual therapy, biofeedback and Alexander technique. Exercise therapy may be considered to improve function. Speech therapy may be considered to improve speech volume in patients with PD complicated by dysarthria. European Journal of Neurology: Joint Task Force Report: European Federation of Neurological Societies/Movement Disorder Society; Early (Uncompl icated) Parkin son's Disease (2011) 83 No adequate clinical trial has provided definitive evidence for pharmacological neuroprotection or disease modifying effect . Initiation of treatment is recommended when signs and symptoms begin to have an impact on patient quality of life. When determining therapy, factors relating to the drug, patient and environment should be taken into account. Symptom control and the prevention of motor complications are the main issues to consider when determining therapy. In the management of e arly untreated PD , monoamine oxidases -B inhibitors (i.e., rasagiline and selegiline) have a modest benefit in treating the symptomatic complications of PD compared to levodopa and (probably) dopamine agonists. These agents are more convenient due to the ease of administration (i.e., one dose, once daily, no titration) and are well tolerated (especially rasagiline) . Amantadine and anticholinergics offer minimal symptom control compared to levodopa. Anticholinergics are poorly tolerated in the elderly and us e should be restricted to younger patients. Levodopa is the most effective anti -Parkinson's drug for symptomatic relief. Early use of levodopa in the elderly is recommended as they are less prone to developing motor complications but more sensitive to neuropsychiatric adverse events. In the prevention of motor complications the early use of controlled-release levodopa is not effective. Pramipexole and ropinirole (immediate or controlled release) are effective dopamine agonists as monotherapy in the treatment of early PD. Convincing evidence that older agents in the class are less effective than the newer non- ergot agents in managing patients with early PD is lacking. Dopamine agonists have a lower risk of developing motor complications. These agents do have a smaller effect on symptoms and Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 72 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) a greater incidence of adverse events which include hallucinations, somnolence and edema in the lower extremities. Younger patients should be started on a dopamine agonist as initial treatment to prolong the use of levodopa and the development of motor complications. Due to the risk of fibrotic reactions ergot derivatives (i.e., bromocriptine, cabergoline and pergolide) are not recommended as first line medications. The benefits of the early combination of low doses of a dopamine agonist with low doses of levodopa have not been appropriately documented. A recommendation cannot be made concerning the efficacy of physical therapy and speech therapy in early PD due to a lack of evidence. Therapy adjustments for patients on dopamine agonist therapy include: o Increase dopamine agonist dose. o Switch to another dopamine agonist. o Add levodopa. Therapy adjustments for patients on dopamine agonist therapy include: o Increase levodopa dose. o Add a dopamine agonist (efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated). o Add a catechol -o-methyltransferase inhibitor if motor symptoms evolve (older and multi -morbid patients of any age preferred). For the treatment of tremor at rest the following are treatment options: o Anticholinergics (possibly us eful). o Clozapine (routine use not recommended due to safety concerns). o Beta-blockers (may be effective). o Deep brain stimulation. European Journal of Neurology: Joint Task Force Report: European Federation of Neurological Societies/Movement Disorder Societ y; Late (Complicated) Parkinson's Disease (2011) 84 Symptomatic control of wearing -off Adjust ing the levodopa dose by increasing the dosing frequency (to four to six daily doses) may attenuate wearing off . Adding a m onoamine oxidases -B inhibitor as they are effective in reducing off -time by one to 1.5 hours/day. A recommendation cannot be mad as to which agent should be utilized first. However tolcapone is only recommended for patients who fail all other available agents due to safety concerns with the agent. Adding a dopamine agonist. All dopamine agonists are equally effective and efficacious in reducing off -time. While non- ergot dopamine agonists are first -line compounds, pergolide and other ergot derivatives are reserved for second- line use, due to the adverse events of valvulopathy. Switching from the standard formulation of levodopa to the controlled-release formulation improves wearing- off symptoms and this formulation is useful in the treatment of night time akinesia. Addition of amantadine or anticholinergics may improve symptoms in some cases and should be considered in patients with severe off symptoms who fail the recommended strategies listed above. Symptomatic control of dyskinesias Reducing the dose size of levodopa has been beneficial in reducing Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 73 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) dyskinesias. The risk of off -time increases but can be compensated by increasing the frequency of levodopa dosing. Discontinuing or reducing the dose of m onoamine oxidases -B inhibitors or catechol -o-methyltr ansferase inhibitors can help control dyskinesias, however the risk of worsening off -time increases. Patients may benefit for up to eight months by adding amantadine 200 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of dyskinesias. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus allows the reduction of dopaminergic treatment. The addition of clozapine or quetiapine has shown to be beneficial in reducing peak dose dyskinesia. Clozapine's adverse events of agranulocytosis limits its use. Apomorphine given as a continuous subcutaneous infusion under direct medical supervision allows for the reduction of levodopa therapy and helps control dyskinesias. Intrajejunal levodopa infusion may be beneficial in patients with marked peak dose dyskinesia and motor fluctuations. Symptomatic control of off -period and early morning dystonias In cases of off -period dystonia usual strategies for wearing off can be applied. For the control of dystonia appearing during the night or early in the morning, additional doses of levodopa or dopamine agonist therapy may be effective. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus may be used for off - period and early morning dystonias. In both off -period and early morning dystonia botulinum toxin can be employed. Treatment of dementia in PD M ost recommendations are off -label. not recommended due to associated hepatotoxicity. An alternative agent should be tried prior to abandoning. If cholinesterase inhibitors not tolerated or lacking efficacy, add or substitute with memantine. Treatment of psychosis in PD Control triggering factors (i.e., infections, metabolic disorders, electrolyte imbalances, sleep disorders). Reduce polypharmacy . Reduce anti -PD agents. The addition of an atypical antipsychotic has shown to be beneficial. Clozapine's adverse event of agranulocytosis limits its use. Quetiapine is thought to be relatively safe and possibly useful; however , sufficient data does not exist. Olanzapine and risperidone are not recommended. Typical antipsychotics should not be used as the y worsen Parkinsonism. Add cholin esterase inhibitors (i.e., rivastigmine, donepezil). Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 74 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) Treatment of depression in PD Optimize antiparkinson therapy. antidepressants. Compared to tricyclic antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are less likely to produce adverse events . No recommendations can be made concerning \"new\" antidepressants reboxetine, venlafaxine). Treatment of orthostatic hypotension in PD Aggravating factors should be avoided (i.e., large meals, alcohol, caffeine at night, warm environment exposure, volume depletion, drugs known to cause orthostatic hypotension) . Drugs that are inhibitors. In symptomatic orthostatic hypotension increase salt intake (1 g per meal). Head up, tilt the bed at night (30 to 40\u00ba), may be helpful. W ear wait high elastic stockings and/or abdominal binders. Exerci se as tolerated. Maneuvers to prolong patient upright should be introduced (i.e., leg crossing, toe raising, thigh contraction, bending at waist). For drug therapy, midodrine is the preferred option. The addition of fludrocor tisone is a secondary option as it is possibl y effective. Treatment of urinary disturbances in PD An urologist should be referenced to for PD patients with bladder problems, at least if response to anticholinergic therapy is insufficient or if intolerance is present. Intake after 6 PM should be reduced for the management of nocturia. Night time dopaminergic therapy should be optimized. Anticholinergic agents should be utilized with priority given to agents that do not pass the blood- brain barrier. The efficacy of botulinum was demonstrated in a pilot study with a small sample size. Symptomatic control of dysphagia in PD A priority should be given to optimization of motor symptoms. In some patients levodopa and apomorphine can improve dysphagia. Early referral to speech therapist for assessment, swallowing advice and further instrumental investigations if needed. In selected cases, video fluoroscopy to exclude silent aspiration. Enteral feeding options may need to be considered. There is still very limited experience with the following therapies and cannot generally be recommended: surgical therapies, rehabilitative treatments and botulinum toxin. Symptomatic control of gastric dysfunction In PD gastric emptying is often delayed. Domperidone can be considered to accelerate gastric empty ing. Transdermal patches may be considered for patients with severe Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 75 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) fluctuations in gastric emptying. Symptomatic control of nausea and vomiting Droperidol is effective and ondansetron may be used as a second line agent. No other antiemetic is recommended. Symptomatic control of c onstipation In PD patients constipation is the most commonly reported gastrointestinal symptom. Anticholinergics should be discontinued as they may worsen constipation. Increased fluid and fiber intake are recommended. Increased physical activity may be beneficial. Polyethylene glycol solution is the preferred therapeutic option with alternative agents being fiber supplements such as psyllium or methylcellulose and osmotic laxatives. Irritant laxatives should be reserved for selected patients and short duration of treatment. Treatment of erectile dysfunction Erectile dysfunction is more common in PD patients compared to matched controls. Agents that are associated with erectile dysfunction should be discontinued. A positive and negative effect on symptoms may be seen with dopaminergic therapy. Sildenafil as well as tadalafil and vardenafil may be tried. Apomorphine injections and intracavernous injections papaverine or alpros tadil may be considered in select patients. Treatment of daytime somnolence and sudden onset of sleep Nocturnal sleep disturbances should be assessed. Disturbances should be reduced to optimize nocturnal sleep. Driving should be stopped. Medications prescribed for other medical conditions should be decreased or discontinued. The dose of dopaminergic agents should be decreased as they may induce daytime somnolence. Switch the dopamine agonist to another dopamine agonist. Add modafinil. Add other wake- promoting agents (i.e., methylphenidate). Treatment of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder Protective measures such as safeguarding the bedroom should be employed to prevent sleep related injuries. Antidepressants, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be reduced or withdrawn. Clozapine may be added at bedtime. Treatment of sleep problems A standard or slow -release dose of levodopa should be added at bed time. Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 76 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical Guideline Recommendation(s) The following agents improve sleep quality in patients with advanced PD with motor fluctuations: transdermal rotigotine, pramipexole and prolonged With the exception of nocturnal motor pheno mena of sleep disorders deep brain stimulation improves sleep quality in patients with advanced PD. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: Parkinson's Disease: Diagnosis and Management in Primary and Secondary Care (2011) 85 There is no universal first -choice therapy for patients with PD. Clinical and lifestyle characteristics of the patient should be taken into account. Levodopa may be used in patients with early PD for symptomatic treatment with doses kept as low as possible to reduce the development of motor complications. Dopamine agonists may be used in patients with early PD for symptomatic treatment. Dopamine agonists should be titrated to a clinically e fficacious dose and another agent in the class may be used if the patient fails therapy or adverse events prevent titration. Monoamine oxidase- B inhibitors may be used in patients with early PD for symptomatic treatment. Beta-blockers may be used for symptomatic treatment of selected people with postural tremor, but are not considered first -line agents. Amantadine may be used in patients with early PD, but is not considered a first -line agent. Anticholinergics may be used in young patients with early PD for symptomatic treatment associated with severe tremor. These agents are not considered first -line due to limited efficacy and the propensity to cause neuropsychiatric adverse events . Extended- release levodopa should not be used to delay the onset of motor complications in patients with early PD. Most patients with PD will develop motor complications over time and will require levodopa therapy. Adjuvant medications have been developed to take concomitantly with levodopa to help reduce the motor complications and improve quality of life associated with late stage PD. There is no single agent of choice for late stage PD. Extended- release levodopa may help reduce motor complications in patients with late stage PD, but is not considered a first -line agent. Dopamine agonists may be used to reduce motor fluctuations in patients with late stage PD. Dopamine agonists should be titrated to a clinically efficacious dose and another agent in the class may be used if adverse events prevent titration. Monoamine oxidase -B inhibitors may be used to reduce motor fluctuations in patients with late stage PD. Catechol -o-methyl transferase inhibitors may be used to reduce motor fluctuations in patients with late stage PD. This class of medication is taken concomitantly with levodopa. Amantadine may be used to reduce dyskinesias in patients with late stage PD. \"Drug holidays\" should be avoided because of the risk of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Conclusions The two antiviral medication classes available for the treatment and prevention of influenza are the neuraminidase inhibitors and the adamantanes. The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 77 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 have activity against both influenza A and B. Oseltamivir is Food and Drug Administration- approved for the treatment of influenza in patients two weeks of age and older, and zanamivir may be used in persons seven years of age and older. For influenza prophylaxis oseltamivir is approved for use in persons one year of age and older, while zanamivir is approved f or prophylaxis in persons five years of age and older.3,4 The adamantanes, amantadine and rimantadine, are known to have activity against only influenza A. Both agents are approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A.9,10 Specifically, rimantadine is approved for treatment of influenza A in patients 17 years of age or older and for prophylaxis of influenza A in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and older. 9,10 Amantadine and rimantadine are similar in thei r antiviral activity and older clinical trial results have shown that they provide a similar treatment benefit. Both agents are currently available generically. When used for the treatment of influenza A within the first two days of illness, both amantadine and rimantadine have been shown to be effective in reducing the duration of illness ; however, c omparative trials between the agents a re limited. Amantadine is also approved for the treatment of Parkinsonism and drug- induced extrapyramidal reaction. 12 National guidelines state that amantadine may be used but the evidence of efficacy is not strong indicating that amantadine is not a first -line agent.81-84 Amantadine is less effective than levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, it has fewer extrapyramidal reactions compared to anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs.7 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention- Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (CDC - ACIP) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization have developed guidelines and recommendations for prevention and control of influenza. Although annual vaccination is the primary strategy for preventing complications of influenza infections, antiviral medications with activity against influenza may be effective for the chemoprophylaxis and treatment of influenza. 15,76,78 These medications should be used in specific situations such as (1) to reduce the spread of influenza to high risk individuals during outbreaks, (2) as chemoprophylaxis during the peak influenza season for unvaccinated individuals who have frequent contact with high risk patients, and (3) individuals at high risk who are expected to have an inadequate antibody response to the influenza vaccine. 15,76,78 Treatment outcomes are most efficacious when antiviral medications are initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset.15,76,78 Clinicians should administer oseltamivir treatment as soon as possible in patients with confirmed or strongly suspected H5N1 and H1N1 Avian influenza, as well as those who are at high risk of contracting the virus. 15,76 This includes children, elderly, immunosuppressed patients or those with co- morbidities, pregnant women, patients 18 years of age receiving long- term aspirin therapy, American Indians/Alaska Natives, morbidly obese patients, nursing home residents, health care personnel, family members who are not immunized and are likely to have close contact with those at high risk, and those who may be in close contact with someone infected with the virus. 15,78 The adamantanes are currently not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of any strain of influenza due to increasing resistance.15,76,78 Clinical stud y results demonstrate that these agents are effective compared to placebo in reducing the burden of illness, with minimal adverse events, when used for the treatment of influenza within the first two days of illness; however, head -to-head clinical trials of the two neuraminidase inhibitors are lacking. 6 One study comparing oseltamivir, zanamivir, and combination therapy demonstrated that the concomitant administration of oseltamivir and zanamivir was less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy, and not significantly more effective than zanamivir monotherapy in reducing viral load and time to resolution of illness, as well as increasing the number of patients with alleviation of symptoms. 57 Another trial by Kawai and colleagues comparing oseltamivir to zanamivir for the treatment of influenza A and B showed statistically significant improvement in fever duration and percentage of patients afebrile at 24 and 48 hours after the first dose of the study drug. Patients with influenza B who were treated with zanamivir demonstrated significantly shorter fever duration as well as a larger percentage of afebrile patients at 24 hours or 48 hours c ompared to patients treated with oseltamivir. Between patients with influenza A and influenza B, no significant difference was found in the percentage of patients afebrile at 24 or 48 hours after the start of zanamivir therapy. 55 Other studies have demonst rated that, when administered within two days of illness onset to otherwise healthy adults, oseltamivir and zanamivir can reduce the duration of uncomplicated influenza A and B illness by approximately one day compared to placebo. As recommended by the CDC, it is imperative to initiate these agents within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms to ensure the efficacy of these agents. Therapeutic Class Review: antivirals: influenza Page 78 of 83 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 05/07/2013 Clinical trials have demonstrated that amantadine and rimantadine are also effective in both the prophylaxis and treatment of inf luenza A; however, due to a marked increase in resistant isolates, the ACIP recommends that adamantanes not be used in the United States for the treatment of influenza, except in selected circumstances.1.1,16,17,23 -26,30,32,54,56,62,64-66 Trials have demonstrated an initial decrease in the viral load of those patients treated with rimantadine, but over time the rimantadine treated patients consistently and increasingly shed influenza virus. Additionally, patients treated with rimantadine had a higher percentage of resistant isolates compared to those receiving acetaminophen alone. 56 .
