Spiritual energy is the life force present in all living beings that connects everything around us and compels us to connect with the world. - Some believe it's a powerful and mysterious energy passed down through generations, carrying both knowledge of the past and hope for the future. - Others view it as a light that emanates from a person's soul and provides a sense of inner peace, joy, and harmony. - Most would agree that spiritual energy stems from a longing to connect with something larger than ourselves, whether a divine intelligence, [our higher selves](https://mindfulzen.co/higher-self-connection/), or the natural world. The energy helps balance your physical, emotional, and mental states and can completely transform your life based on how you focus it. Though its impact might not be immediately recognizable, spiritual energy is essential to creating a compassionate and contented life. What Are The Types of Spiritual Energy? There are many spiritual energy types, which include positive, negative, and neutral. Let's take a look at each energy time in more depth: - Positive Spiritual Energy: Positive spiritual energy brings joy, hope, and peace. It's the highest form of spiritual energy, and it's essential for [emotional healing](https://mindfulzen.co/journal-prompts-healing/), motivation, inspiration, and creativity. This type of energy encourages us to take action to reach our goals and dreams. - Negative Spiritual Energy: This type of spiritual energy is characterized by feelings of anger, fear, sadness, and hopelessness. It can be caused by other people's negative thoughts or energies, difficult life experiences, or even our own self-doubt. This type of energy can cause us to feel drained and disempowered. - Neutral spiritual energy: This is simply the balance between the two types of spiritual energy. It is the state of peace, clarity, and understanding that we strive for in life. Neutral spiritual energy allows us to learn from our experiences and make informed decisions with a clear mind. 9 Ways To Increase Your Spiritual Energy Levels Your spiritual energy is like a battery, with highs and lows depending on how you take care of yourself and how well you recharge. When your spiritual fuel is low, you may feel discouraged and overwhelmed, but you'll find it easier to stay motivated and inspired when it's high. So how can you keep your battery full? Here are some habits that will help increase your energy levels: 1. Take Advantage of Meditation Techniques One of the best ways to increase your spiritual force is by engaging in meditation techniques. Whether you [focus on breathing](https://mindfulzen.co/mindful-breathing-exercises/) or repeating a mantra, meditation can help you become more mindful and attuned to your inner resources. It calms your mind, allowing you to connect with your inner self and develop a greater sense of serenity and connection. Set aside time each day for a few minutes of uninterrupted meditation practice. Start with ten minutes a day, and as you get more comfortable, you can keep adding more time to your practice until you can meditate for longer periods. There are many highly-effective [meditation apps](https://mindfulzen.co/meditation-apps/) you can use to build your practice. Also, try using spiritual affirmations as part of your meditation to help you reinforce your spiritual goals. 2. Take Your Shoes Off And Spend Time in Nature There's something incredibly calming - and energizing - about spending time outdoors in nature. Whether it's walking on the beach, taking a hike through a forest, or simply enjoying the beauty of a sunset, natural settings can be potent places for spiritual exploration and renewal. If you'd like to connect physically with the earth with [grounding](https://mindfulzen.co/grounding-meditation-scripts/) energy, take off your shoes or wear grounding shoes during your walk. When outside:: - Take time to enjoy the sights and sounds around you - Pay attention to the smells and how they make you feel - Observe any plants or animals that may be nearby - Take notice of how the air or the sun feels against your skin; - Connect with any feelings that might rise inside you as you engage with nature's beauty - Take deep breaths in and out, allowing yourself to feel the energy of nature flowing through your body Remember, the key is mindfulness, as you fully immerse yourself in the experience. View the outing as a walking meditation in which you are fully attentive and aware. 3. Adopt Healthy Eating Habits According to [traditional Chinese medicine](https://hakkasan.com/stories/yin-yang/#:~:text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20foods%20that%20have,are%20considered%20warm%2C%20or%20yang.), different foods have yin or yang energies associated with them - which influence our physical and spiritual bodies and emotions. Incorporating healthy eating habits into your routine can help balance out these energies within us and boost your spiritual energy levels naturally over time. Try including more fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet (which have higher yin energies) while limiting processed foods (more yang). Additionally, reduce caffeine or sugary beverages if possible - these tend to deplete our energy levels throughout the day instead of nourishing them! You should also ensure to drink plenty of water throughout the day since dehydration can lead to fatigue and decreased energy. 4. Practice Gratitude And Appreciation Have you been thankful today for all the good happening in your life? Have you taken a few moments to appreciate the people and things that make your life blessed? If not, it's time to start. Regularly expressing gratitude and appreciation can increase your spiritual energy levels. When you focus on what you have instead of what you don't, your spirit becomes lighter and more positive. Take some time each day to be grateful for something - whether it's the roof over your head or a warm cup of coffee that you enjoy in the morning. This appreciation is an essential form of self-care and should be practiced as often as possible. More Related Articles [Spirituality Vs.

Connect with Your Spirit Guides A spirit guide is like fuel for your spiritual growth, just like food is for your body. Connecting with spiritual guides can help you stay focused and energized on your spiritual path while providing guidance, advice, and insight when needed. When connecting with your guides, you'll need to open yourself up completely to receive guidance from a meditation master, spiritual teacher, or clergy. Some view metaphysical beings as spirit guides, such as angels, ancestors who have passed away, ascended masters, or other divine beings that come through as messages in dreams or during meditation and prayer. Take some time every day (or whenever it feels necessary) to connect with your guides and allow yourself to absorb their wisdom, advice, and spiritual energy. This practice can help you stay connected with your spiritual goals and hone your spiritual energy when done regularly and with an open heart. 6. Limit Your Exposure To Social Media Exposure to certain types of media, such as news broadcasts and violent video games, can negatively affect our emotional and spiritual state - so try limiting this type of exposure when possible. You can do this by: - Unplugging from tech devices several hours before bedtime - Reducing the amount of time you spend on social media - Not using your phone or computer in bed - Monitoring the type of information and media you're consuming. Remember, too much information being thrown at us quickly makes it difficult for our minds and bodies to process all this sensory overload. This ultimately leads to various forms of stress over extended periods, which depletes your [spirituality](https://mindfulzen.co/soul-searching-questions/) instead of nourishing your soul. So, by decreasing your exposure to negative energy, you can create space for more positive spiritual energy to enter your life. 7. Use Spiritual Energy Crystals [Spiritual energy crystals](https://mindfulzen.co/crystals-meditation/) have long been believed to increase spiritual energy. Crystals, like rose quartz and amethyst, have been used for centuries to connect us with our higher selves and harness positive energy. Here is a list of other stones and their possible uses: - Carnelian Crystals: These provide much-needed emotional support for women undergoing reproductive issues, helping them embrace, love, and support their life-making abilities. - Black Obsidian Crystals: This is a root chakra stone that helps you stay grounded. - Rose Quartz Crystals: These crystals attract positive energy into your space by enhancing self-love and unconditional love for others. - Chrysocolla Crystals: (Goddess Stone) The chrysocolla stone stimulates the mind, giving it calm and peaceful energy. To use these crystals, place them in areas of your home or workspace where you feel the most comfortable and relaxed. You can also carry one with you or wear it as jewelry to help you stay connected to a higher vibration. Even if you don't believe that crystals have spiritual powers, they can serve as reminders to work on some of the actions listed here. 8. Read Spiritually Inspiring Literature And Journal The internet is an incredible tool available to everyone today. And while information and knowledge are abundant, why not use it to your advantage? Start by finding and reading spiritually inspiring literature such as books, articles, blog posts, or stories. You will gain new perspectives and knowledge and help your mind stay energized and engaged with spiritual ideas. Once you find something that resonates with you, try reflecting on the ideas by writing in a journal. You can jot down your thoughts and feelings or express yourself creatively through music, poetry, or art. This type of reflective writing is a great way to tap into your inner world and enhance self-awareness. It can also be used as a form of meditation - using the power of words to nurture and nourish your soul. 9. Create a Sacred Space In Your Home Devote a space in your home for practicing spiritual activities such as meditation, prayer, or journaling. Creating a sacred space doesn't have to be complicated - all you need is a comfortable spot and maybe a few decorations encouraging you to feel relaxed and centered. Set up a minimalist space free from clutter with a place to meditate or pray and a place to write. A few candles, spiritual symbols, and incense (if you like it) can add to the energy you want to achieve. The important thing is that you make this space your own - using it as an area for reflection, contemplation, and using spiritual energy. What Are the Benefits of Increasing Your Spiritual Energy? By using the above tips to increase your spiritual energy, you will experience many positive benefits. - Enhanced creativity and intuition: With higher spiritual awareness, you can tap into your creative side and use it to build your goals and dreams. Whether you're an artist, entrepreneur, or just looking for a new perspective on life, using your spiritual energy is a great way to gain insight and fresh ideas. - Improved mental clarity: By using spiritual activities such as meditation, you will experience enhanced mental clarity while reducing stress and anxiety levels. This will help to improve your focus and mental well-being, allowing you to take on life's challenges with a clear mind. - A boost of positivity: Increasing your spiritual energy is also a great way to feel more positive about life. Using the power of crystals, literature, and reflection pieces, you can tap into a source of positivity that will help you stay grounded and energized even during times of difficulty. - Better relationships: By embracing the different spiritual practices above, you will be able to foster more meaningful connections with those around you and find peace within yourself. This will help to create a better understanding within yourself and others, allowing you to live a more harmonious life. - Increased self-awareness: Knowing who you are and what you stand for is one of the essential steps in living a fulfilling life.
