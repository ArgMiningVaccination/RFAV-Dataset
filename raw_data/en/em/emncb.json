Outside, the sun is shining and the birds are chirping. The fresh air and warmer temperatures lift our spirits and energize us. During this time of year, we may experience the urge to \"spring clean\" and create a fresh start. While spring cleaning is commonly associated with cleaning one's home, it can also be applied to our hearts. In the same way our homes become disorganized and cluttered, we may lose sight of what is important and stray away from spiritual discipline. So, how do we go about spiritual spring cleaning? It is important to evaluate ourselves and identify the aspects of our spiritual walk that need improvement. Is the way we think honorable to God? Is He pleased with our actions and the way we treat others? Colossians 1:10 says, \"So as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.\" When the Holy Spirit is at work within us, we can demonstrate the [fruits of the spirit](/blog/?s=fruit+of+the+spirit), such as love, kindness, gentleness and self-control. If we are lacking in these things, it may be because we are not spending time with the Lord and allowing the Holy Spirit to work in us. James 4:8 says, \"Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.\" Once we have identified our shortcomings, we can work towards eliminating things in our life that may be hindering us spiritually. For example, worry, selfish ambition and impurity can hold us back in our walk with Christ. We do not have to go about the spiritual cleaning process alone, though. When we bring our burdens to the Lord, He walks alongside us. Through Him, we can become clean again and find forgiveness. In addition, reading His Word can help us to become stronger in our faith. According to Psalm 119:105, the Word acts as a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. Ultimately, spending time with the Lord and reading His Word are the only tools we need in spiritual spring cleaning. Through self-evaluation and spending time in prayer, God can reveal to us the areas of our lives where we need improvement. So, during this season of spring, I encourage you to renew your walk with Christ and draw closer to Him. Spending time in prayer and in God's Word allows us to align our hearts with His and live in a way that is honorable to Him.
