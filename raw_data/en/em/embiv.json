This adjuvant consists of a 547-nt uncapped noncoding ssRNA containing polyU repeats that is stabilized by a cationic carrier peptide. Whereas vaccination of mice with an influenza subunit vaccine induced moderate virus-specific IgG1, vaccination together with RNAdjuvant significantly enhanced this IgG1 and additionally promoted the formation of IgG2b/c, which is indicative of Th1 responses. Furthermore, such sera neutralized influenza virus, whereas this effect was not detected upon vaccination with the subunit vaccine alone. Similarly, upon vaccination with virus-like particles displaying vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, RNAdjuvant promoted the formation of virus-specific IgG2b/c and enhanced neutralizing IgG responses to an extent that mice were protected against lethal virus infection. RNAdjuvant induced dendritic cells to upregulate activation markers and produce IFN-I. Although these effects were strictly TLR7 dependent, RNAdjuvant-mediated augmentation of vaccine responses needed concurrent TLR and RIG-I-like helicase signaling. This was indicated by the absence of the adjuvant effect in vaccinated MyD88/Cardif/ mice, which are devoid of TLR (with the exception of TLR3) and RIG-I-like helicase signaling, whereas in vaccinated MyD88/ mice the adjuvant effect was reduced. Notably, i.m. RNAdjuvant injection induced local IFN-I responses and did not induce systemic effects, implying good tolerability and a favorable safety profile for RNAdjuvant. Introduction Extensive clinical experience with subunit vaccines against microbial infections exposed insufficient immunogenicity as a major hurdle ( [1](javascript:;)). Although the judicious choice of relevant Ags remains central, safe means for the induction of strong and sustained immune responses are equally important. This persistent medical need has renewed interest in new adjuvants. Aluminum hydroxide (alum)-based adjuvants have been in extensive clinical use for decades ( [2](javascript:;), [3](javascript:;)). A drawback of alum-based adjuvants is that they confer a profound Th2-polarized immune response (i.e., Ab responses dominated by Igs of the IgG1 subclass) ( [4](javascript:;), [5](javascript:;)), whereas, for the control of Th1-biased cellular responses seem to be advantageous ( [6](javascript:;)). Advances in the mechanistic understanding of immune stimulation, and in particular the role of innate immunity in the shaping of pathogen-specific responses, inspired rational adjuvant design. In this context, monophoshoryl lipid A, which is a detoxified TLR4 ligand, was developed for the combined usage in the papilloma vaccine Cervarix ( [7](javascript:;), [8](javascript:;)). The use of different adjuvants in one vaccine is motivated by the observation that the simultaneous triggering of several TLRs synergistically activates dendritic cells response ( [9](javascript:;), [10](javascript:;)). This phenomenon is similarly observed upon infection with a live pathogen or upon vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine, where several pattern recognition receptors are usually triggered and, thus, strong immune protection is induced, as described, for example, for the live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF-17D. YF-17D was shown to activate several DC subsets upon triggering of four TLRs ( [11](javascript:;)). The efficacy of live-attenuated YF-17D was connected the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( [11](javascript:;), [12](javascript:;)). Especially the presence of nucleic acids was shown to promote strong immune responses ( [12](javascript:;), [13](javascript:;)). RNA-sensing receptors are particularly diverse and constitute promising adjuvant targets. From the well-described TLR family, TLR3 [14](javascript:;), With the exception of TLR3, signaling of all TLRs is mediated by the adaptor protein MyD88, whereas TLR3 signals in a TRIF-dependent manner. Cytosolic RNA receptors recognize structural features of pathogen-associated RNA. The RIG-I-like helicases (RLHs) RIG-I with 5-triphosphate modifications ( [16](javascript:;)), and signals are transmitted by the adaptor Cardif (also known as IPS-1, VISA, or MAVS). Downstream signaling of MyD88, TRIF, and Cardif leads to the activation of various transcription factors, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-I. By integrating the signals from different pattern recognition receptors, APCs orchestrate the induction of appropriate immune responses. Triggering RNA-sensing receptors typically leads to the release of IFN-I and induction of antiviral Th1 and CD8+ T cell responses, as shown for the dsRNA analog polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]. The strong adjuvant capacity of poly(I:C) and its derivatives can be explained by its ability to trigger two independent signaling pathways: TLR3 and MDA5 ( [15](javascript:;), [17](javascript:;)). Unfortunately, the massive cytokine release induced by poly(I:C) results in systemic side effects ( [18](javascript:;)). Because the poly(I:C)-induced cytokine storm seems to be induced by the triggering of RLH ( [19](javascript:;)), the development of dsRNA molecules that selectively trigger TLR3 might be one promising approach ( [20](javascript:;)). In contrast to dsRNAs, ssRNAs as TLR7/8 agonists are less well studied as vaccine adjuvants. Several previous studies showed that synthetic TLR7/8 agonists exhibit adjuvant function and confer Th1 skewing ( [21](javascript:;)- [23](javascript:;)); however, these effects were only moderate. Interestingly, an intrinsic adjuvant effect of protamine-complexed ssRNA was detected in tumor-vaccination studies in which coding mRNA was used ( [24](javascript:;)- [26](javascript:;)). Under such conditions, a critical role for TLR7 was noted ( [25](javascript:;)), whereas the contribution of other mechanisms remained unclear ( [26](javascript:;)). We studied the effects induced by RNAdjuvant, a new immune enhancer based on ssRNA containing polyU repeats ( [27](javascript:;)). The RNA component is formulated as a complex with a carrier consisting of disulfide-cross-linked cationic peptides with the sequence CR12C ( [28](javascript:;)). Our results indicate that RNAdjuvant exhibits potent immunoenhancing effects by simultaneously triggering two independent signaling platforms (TLR and RLH) that induce localized responses. Materials and Methods Ethics statement Animal experiments were conducted following Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations guidelines and under permission of the Nieders\u00e4chsisches Landesamt f\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit. Mice and viruses were from Harlan Winkelmann. IFNAR/ mice ( [29](javascript:;)) were backcrossed mice were obtained by intercrossing MyD88/ and Cardif/ mice. Mice used in this study were backcrossed for 10 generations on the C57BL/6 background and were bred under pathogen-free conditions at the mouse facility of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research or at TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Infection Research. Experiments were carried out with 8-15-wk-old mice. Vesicular stomatitis virus serotype Indiana, Mudd-Summers isolate (VSV) was originally obtained from D. Kolakofsky (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). VSV was grown on BHK-21 cells (Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures). Virus was harvested from cell culture supernatants, and titers were determined by plaque formation on Vero cells. Production and characterization of virus-like particles Human embryonic kidney-293FT cells (1 \u00d7 107 cells) were transiently 48 h, culture supernatants from 1.2 \u00d7 108 transfected cells were collected and subjected to low-speed centrifugation (2500 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C) for 20 h. Subsequently, the virus-like particles (VLPs)-containing supernatant were filtered through a 0.45-m-pore filter and resuspended in 1-3 ml of 1% FCS, PBS. The quality of VSV-G displaying VLPs was analyzed by ELISA. To this end, VLPs displaying vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VLP-VSV) were 1/100 with 0.1 M NaHCO3. Then, serial 3-fold dilutions (log3) were prepared with 0.1 M NaHCO3, and 100 l of the different VLP-VSV dilutions were added per well. After overnight incubation, the plates were washed and blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h. For VSV-G detection, (American Type Culture Collection) for 1.5 HRP-conjugated anti-mouse Ab (Invitrogen) or anti-goat Ab (Dako Cytomation) was used to detect VI24 or anti-p30, respectively. The amount of VLPs was determined by a reverse-transcriptase assay, as described previously ( [40](javascript:;)). Upon VLP-VSV immunization of C57BL/6 mice, Th-independent IgM was induced on day 4, which switched to IgG only moderately on days 8-12. Thus, day-4 IgM responses served as an internal control for proper vaccination, and a moderate level of IgG at day 12 verified the usage of appropriate amounts of vaccine. VSV-neutralization assay Serial 2-fold dilutions of 1:40 prediluted serum samples mixed with equal volumes of VSV containing 3 \u00d7 103 PFU/ml, and the mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. A total of 100 l of the mixture was transferred onto Vero cell (Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Monolayers were overlaid with 100 l of 1% methylcellulose and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. After removal of the overlay, the monolayer was fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet dissolved in 5% formaldehyde, 50% ethanol, and 4.25% NaCl. The serum dilution reducing the number of plaques by 50% was taken as titer. To determine IgG titers, undiluted serum was treated with an equal volume of 280 mM 2-ME for 1 h at room temperature (RT) before samples were treated as described above. Immunization of mice RNAdjuvant is a novel physicochemically well-defined RNA-based adjuvant. The synthetic RNA component consists of a noncoding, noncapped ssRNA sequence containing several polyU repeats ( [27](javascript:;)). The RNA component is complexed with a polymeric carrier formed by a disulfide-cross-linked cationic peptide ( [28](javascript:;)) and is fully protected against RNase degradation. It was shown that PBMCs stimulated with the RNA or carrier component alone did not mount cytokine responses, whereas stimulation with fully formulated RNAdjuvant resulted in significant TNF- and IFN- production ( [41](javascript:;)). For immunization, VLP-VSV in PBS enriched with 1% FCS was injected or not with high m.w. (HMW) poly(I:C) (50 g per dose; InvivoGen) or per dose; CureVac). Alternatively, mice were immunized i.m. with a total of 0.45 g of hemagglutinin (HA) of trivalent Influvac (0.15 g of HA per influenza strain) adjuvanted with 1 mg of alum (2% Alhydrogel; InvivoGen), 50 g of poly(I:C), or 30 g of RNAdjuvant, followed by a booster vaccination on day 14. Considering that humans are vaccinated with Influvac at a dose of 45 g of HA, mice received an 35-fold higher dose than humans when compared on a per-kilogram basis, providing that humans and mice have an average weight of 75 kg and 20 g, respectively. For alum adjuvantation, Influvac was incubated in Alhydrogel 2% for 5 min, as recommended in the data sheet. For i.v. immunization, mice were injected with 200 l into the tail vein. For i.m. immunization, anesthetized mice were injected with 25 l per leg into the musculus tibialis posterior of both hind legs. For intranasal (i.n.) immunization, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg ketamine and 10 mg xylazine per gram of body weight and 20 l of the vaccine suspension was applied to the nostrils. Active and passive protection assays For the active protection assay, Cardif/ mice were immunized i.n. on day 0, boosted on day 14, and infected 2 wk after the boost (i.n.) with 103 PFU of VSV. Survival of mice was monitored over 16 d postinfection. For passive immunization, JHT/ mice were injected i.p. with 50 l of serum samples on day 0, and mice were infected i.v. with 2 \u00d7 104 PFU of VSV 4 h later. A second adoptive serum transfer was performed on day 3. For immunoglobulins the distribution volume of a 25-g mouse is in the range of 2-3 ml ( [42](javascript:;)). Thus, the 50 l adoptively transferred serum sample was diluted in vivo by 40-60-fold, which in the case of adoptive transfer of hyperimmune (HI) serum resulted in VSV-neutralizing serum titers of 40 \u00d7 26. Survival was monitored for 20 d after virus challenge. For the generation of VSV-specific HI serum, C57BL/6 mice were infected i.v. with 2 \u00d7 106 PFU of VSV and boosted with the same dose of virus 4 wk later; mice were terminally bled 14 d after the last treatment. Serum of immunized C57BL/6 mice was obtained on day 28 postimmunization. Quantification of VSV-specific serum Abs Sucrose-purified VSV was plated on 0.1 M plates blocked with incubated for 2 h at Biotech) was added for 1 h at RT. After washing, the substrate (1 mg/ml ABTS diammonium salt H2O2) was incubated for 50 min, and OD was measured at = 405 nm. Quantification of influenza-specific Ab subclasses To detect H1N1 Abs, 1/256-diluted (Baxter), which contains the whole inactivated virus of H1N1 influenza A/California/7/09, was coated on 96-well MaxiSorp plates (100 l per well) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing and blocking for 2 h with 1% at 37\u00b0C, sera were on the plate. Sera were incubated for 3 h at RT. Next, 100 l of biotin-coupled Abs that recognize IgG1, IgG2b, or IgG2c Ab subclasses (all from BD Pharmingen) was incubated for 1 h at RT. A total of 100 l of streptavidin coupled with HRP (BD Pharmingen) was incubated for 30 min at RT, followed by incubation with 100 l of the substrate ABTS diammonium salt (Sigma-Aldrich). The absorption of the colored substrate was measured at = 405 nm using a plate reader (BioTek). Microneutralization assay Functional A/California/7/09 H1N1pdm) heat at 56\u00b0C for 30 min, and stored at 20\u00b0C at least overnight, were diluted with 5% CO2 for 1 h. MDCK cells (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the mixtures at a concentration of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells per well and incubated for 18 h. Then, cells were fixed using 80% acetone, and infection efficacy was assessed by ELISA with a mouse monoclonal anti-influenza nucleoprotein Ab determined by OD at = 450 nm, and titers below the detection limit (1:50) were read as a titer of 0 for the subsequent analysis. Detection of bioluminescence and in vivo imaging To detect luciferase activity in vivo, IFN--luc/wt mice injected i.v. with Synchem) and anesthetized isoflurane (Albrecht). The luminescence was detected using the IVIS 2000 imaging system (PerkinElmer). Analysis and quantification of luminescence intensity were performed using Living Image 3.2 (PerkinElmer). For ex vivo determination of luciferase activity in different organs and lymph nodes (LNs), the respective organs were prepared at the indicated time points after adjuvant application and stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. After tissue homogenization in Glo Lysis Buffer, a Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (both from Promega) was used to determine bioluminescence activity using a plate reader (BioTek). Generation of 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin (Life Technologies), 100 g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 0.1 mM 2-ME to isolate bone marrow cells. After RBC lysis (RBC lysing buffer; Sigma-Aldrich), cells were washed and seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells per milliliter in medium supplemented with bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-mDCs) or at a density of 2 \u00d7 106 cells per milliliter in medium supplemented with were incubated for 8 d. Flt3 ligand culture medium was changed on day 4, whereas GM-CSF culture medium was changed on days 4, 6, and 7 by replacing two thirds of the volume with fresh medium supplemented with cytokines. The GM-CSF cultures containing purification Dendritic Cell Isolation Kit II; resulted in cell suspensions containing 95% Siglec-H+CD11clow pDCs. In vitro stimulation of DCs For stimulation experiments, in vitro-differentiated BM-mDCs and BM-pDCs were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells per milliliter in 24- or 96-well plates. BM-mDCs were stimulated for 24 h and BM-pDCs were stimulated for 18 h with RNAdjuvant at the indicated concentrations. For BM-mDCs, the MDA5 agonist poly(I:C) were used as positive controls. naive pDCs are negative for TLR3 and RLH, pDCs were stimulated M; both from InvivoGen) as positive controls. Ex vivo analysis of draining lymphoid organs Spleen and various LNs were harvested 18 h after adjuvant application, and single-cell suspensions were prepared using a cell strainer (BD Falcon) and stored on ice for further processing. Flow cytometry and counting of blood lymphocytes For flow cytometric analysis of single-cell suspensions, cells were stained with combinations of Abs using a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen). Samples were examined using an LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and data were analyzed with FlowJo 7.6.5 software (TreeStar). Blood B and T cells were counted as described previously using AccuCheck counting beads, following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) ( [44](javascript:;)). measurement by ELISA For the determination of serum IFN-I levels, blood samples were drawn at the indicated time points. IFN- and IFN- concentrations in serum or cell culture supernatants were determined by ELISAs (eBioscience, PBL Biomedical Laboratories) that were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain a higher sensitivity of the IFN- ELISA, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. Statistics Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.02 software (GraphPad). Results Vaccination together with Ag-specific IgG1 and induces IgG2b/c responses Because subunit vaccines usually are poor immunogens, in the first vaccination experiments we assessed the immunoenhancing capacity of RNAdjuvant in the context of the seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) subunit vaccine Influvac. Upon i.m. administration of Influvac alone, moderate IAV-specific IgG1 responses were induced, whereas the adjuvant IgG2c responses ( [Fig. 1A](javascript:;)), the latter of which are of Th1 responses ( [45](javascript:;)). Similar to poly(I:C), RNAdjuvant IgG2b and IgG2c ( [Fig. 1A](javascript:;)). Individual mice that were rechecked 150 d after immunization together with RNAdjuvant still showed elevated antiviral IgG2b and IgG2c titers, whereas this effect was not observed after immunization with Influvac alone ( [Fig. 1B](javascript:;)). Furthermore, poly(I:C) RNAdjuvant induced neutralizing Ab responses, alone did not ( [Fig. 1C](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) To further study the capacity of RNAdjuvant to enhance humoral immunity, we performed vaccination experiments with VLP-VSV. In previous experiments, we found that vaccination with VLP-VSV alone induced short-lived VSV-neutralizing Th-independent IgM that switched Th-dependent manner VLP-VSV vaccination together with RNAdjuvant, IgG switch was enhanced significantly at RNAdjuvant dosages between 3 and 30 g per immunization ( [Fig. 1D](javascript:;)). Notably, 30 g of RNAdjuvant induced a similar enhancement of IgG responses as observed in immunization experiments with VLP-VSV plus ( not shown). Interestingly, under conditions of enhanced Th-dependent IgG switch, overall reduced Th-independent VSV-neutralizing IgM titers were detected, which presumably were due to the comparably early and rapid IgG switch ( [Fig. 1D](javascript:;)). The immunoenhancing effect upon i.m. vaccination ( [Fig. 1E](javascript:;)). To study the protective effect of vaccine-induced humoral immunity, we first applied a passive immunization setting: B cell-deficient JHT/ mice were adoptively transferred with serum drawn from immunized mice, and survival was monitored following VSV challenge. Although all JHT/ mice treated with control serum from naive mice succumbed to infection, 100% of the mice treated with HI serum of VSV-infected mice survived ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)). In contrast, treatment with serum of VLP-VSV-immunized improved survival only moderately ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)), whereas serum of VLP-VSV plus RNAdjuvant-immunized mice was nearly as protective as HI serum or serum of VLP-VSV Additionally, RNAdjuvant and poly(I:C) proved similarly effective in an active immunization setting using Cardif/ mice ( [Fig. 2B](javascript:;)), which are defective in RLH signaling and, thus, are particularly sensitive to i.n. VSV challenge ( [46](javascript:;), [47](javascript:;)). These data indicated that RNAdjuvant enhanced VLP-VSV-induced IgG responses to such an extent that mice were protected against lethal virus infection. [Close modal](javascript:;) RNAdjuvant treatment triggers confined IFN-I responses and TLR7-dependent upregulation of activation markers on DCs To investigate the mechanism of RNAdjuvant-mediated immunoenhancing effects, we first studied in and CD69 upregulation reminiscent R848 stimulation ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;), [3C](javascript:;)). To study analyzed DCs generated from MyD88/, TRIF/, or Cardif/ mice, which are defective in TLR signaling (with the exception of TLR3), TLR3 signaling, or RLH signaling, respectively. To analyze whether critical mechanism in vivo, wild-type (WT), MyD88/, and CD11b+CD11c+ mDCs and Siglec-H+ analyzed h Unlike DCs of WT mice, neither mDCs nor vivo conditions, RNAdjuvant triggered DCs directly in a upregulate markers. [Close modal](javascript:;) [Close supernatant from of activation markers on BM-mDCs and BM-pDCs was dependent on the expression of the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) (data not shown). [Close modal](javascript:;) Because IFNAR signaling was critically involved in RNAdjuvant-mediated upregulation of DC activation markers, we next addressed whether it was also needed to confer immunoenhancing effects. Interestingly, immunization of IFNAR/ mice with VLP-VSV plus RNAdjuvant resulted in enhanced IgG switch compared with IFNAR/ mice that were vaccinated with VLP-VSV alone; however, this difference was less pronounced than in WT controls ( [Fig. 6](javascript:;)). These data indicated that IFN-I was one of the effector cytokines, but not the only one, that mediated the effect of RNAdjuvant in TLR7 was crucial in markers on ( [Figs. 3](javascript:;), [4](javascript:;)), we next studied whether TLR signaling played a role in conferring RNAdjuvant-mediated immunoenhancing effects. Upon VLP-VSV plus RNAdjuvant vaccination, MyD88/ mice showed a moderately reduced IgG switch compared with WT mice ( [Fig. 7A](javascript:;)). Additionally, adjuvant effect of RNAdjuvant in TRIF/, MyD88/TRIF/, and Cardif/ mice was very similar that observed in WT mice ( [Fig. 7A](javascript:;), [7B](javascript:;)). Nevertheless, mice ( [Fig. [7B](javascript:;)). To confirm this next immunized MyD88/Cardif/ mice with Influvac plus RNAdjuvant. Under these conditions, enhancement of IgG1 responses was also decreased only moderately, whereas IgG2b and IgG2c responses were no longer induced ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)). In summary, these results indicated that redundant TLR and RLH signaling critically conferred RNAdjuvant-mediated immunoenhancing effects in vivo. [Close modal](javascript:;) RNAdjuvant induces strictly local immune responses after i.m. injection Because RNAdjuvant showed similarly strong adjuvant effects as poly(I:C), we wondered whether it would also induce cytokine responses that were as strong as those induced by poly(I:C). To study cytokine responses in vivo, we took advantage of a reporter mouse expressing luciferase under the control of the IFN- promoter ( [37](javascript:;)). Such IFN- reporter mice were injected i.v. with poly(I:C) or RNAdjuvant. Although poly(I:C) treatment induced massive luciferase activity in spleen, liver, kidney, and various LNs ( [Fig. 8A](javascript:;), [8B](javascript:;)), i.v. treatment with RNAdjuvant resulted in activity only in the spleen ( [8B](javascript:;)). Similarly, after i.m. administration of poly(I:C), luciferase activity was detected throughout the body, particularly in spleen, liver, kidney, and cervical LNs (cLNs) ( [Fig. 8C](javascript:;), [8D](javascript:;)), whereas upon i.m. injection of luciferase activity was primarily found within the draining popliteal LNs and lumbar LNs (lLNs). Notably, luciferase signals detected following i.m. RNAdjuvant lower with poly(I:C) ( [Fig. 8C](javascript:;), [8D](javascript:;)). Analysis serum IFN- and IFN- responses were triggered upon i.v. and i.m. application of poly(I:C), whereas RNAdjuvant treatment did [Fig. 9A](javascript:;), [9B](javascript:;)). Similarly, not result in detectable TNF- responses in local IFN-I responses, we next analyzed CD69 induction of B cells, which is known to be dependent on IFNAR triggering ( [44](javascript:;)). Indeed, upon i.v. and i.m. injection of poly(I:C), CD69 upregulation of B cells was detected in all secondary lymphoid tissues analyzed ( [Fig. 9D](javascript:;), [9F](javascript:;)). In contrast, upon i.v. administration of RNAdjuvant, only B cells in spleen showed a similar CD69 upregulation as observed upon poly(I:C) treatment, whereas only minor CD69 upregulation was detected in other secondary 9D](javascript:;), [9E](javascript:;)). Of note, CD69 upregulation of B cells was detected in the draining LNs but not in other secondary lymphoid organs upon i.m. RNAdjuvant injection ( [Fig. 9D](javascript:;), [9F](javascript:;)). In a previous study, we found that low levels of serum IFN-I directly conferred transient lymphopenia ( [44](javascript:;)). Therefore, we next studied lymphopenia as a biological readout of even very minor cytokine responses. Although i.v. and i.m. injection of poly(I:C) induced lymphopenia that reverted within 4 d, short-lived lymphopenia was detected only 1 d after i.v. RNAdjuvant ( [Fig. 9G](javascript:;), [9H](javascript:;)). ( [Fig. 9H](javascript:;)). These data indicated that i.m. RNAdjuvant primarily induced local, and not systemic, cytokine responses. Discussion We demonstrate, using two vaccination models, Influvac and VLP-VSV, that RNAdjuvant significantly enhanced virus-specific humoral vaccine responses. In these models, RNAdjuvant promoted the formation of long-lasting virus-specific IgG2b with RNAdjuvant, the IgG switch of neutralizing Ab responses was enhanced to such an extent that mice were protected against lethal virus infection. Interestingly, RNAdjuvant induced strictly localized cytokine responses. RNAdjuvant triggered activation marker upregulation and cytokine release of DCs in a TLR7-dependent manner, whereas RNAdjuvant-mediated immunoenhancement was dependent on TLR and RLH signaling. Immunization of mice with the subunit vaccine Influvac alone induced only low IgG1 Ab responses, whereas immunization with Influvac plus RNAdjuvant induced long-lasting virus-specific IgG2b and with Influvac adjuvanted with RNAdjuvant or poly(I:C) resulted in Ab responses that neutralized IAV. Because C57BL/6 mice are not susceptible to IAV strains against which Influvac induces Ab responses, we further investigated the immunoenhancing capacity of RNAdjuvant with an experimental vaccine, retroparticles displaying VSV-G. In previous studies, we found that i.v. immunization with VLP-VSV primarily induced Th-independent short-lived virus-neutralizing IgM, whereas only a moderate IgG switch was detected. Addition of an adjuvant, such as poly(I:C), enhanced the IgG switch to a similar extent as observed under conditions of VSV infection ( [40](javascript:;)). These properties made VLP-VSV an ideal model vaccine to study the immunoenhancing effects of RNAdjuvant on virus-neutralizing Ab responses. In this study, we found that vaccination with VLP-VSV plus RNAdjuvant enhanced the binding and neutralizing capacity of Ab responses and that the vaccine-induced immune response was enhanced to such an extent that mice were protected against lethal VSV infection. Upon i.m. application of RNAdjuvant alone, only local cytokine responses were induced, as indicated by the lack of serum IFN-I and TNF- and the absence of transient lymphopenia. Under such conditions, CD69 upregulation of B cells as a marker of IFNAR triggering was still detectable in draining LNs. Despite the induction of exclusively local IFN-I responses, immunoenhancing effects were very abundant, as indicated by significantly upregulated neutralizing serum IgG levels detected upon immunization with VLP-VSV plus RNAdjuvant. This observation was in stark contrast to i.m. poly(I:C), which conferred significant immunoenhancing effects at the expense of massive serum IFN-I responses, which caused long-lasting severe lymphopenia. Similarly, in a previous study demonstrating the immunostimulatory capacity of RNAdjuvant in the context of antitumor vaccination, RNAdjuvant acted locally at the injection site and in the draining LNs ( [41](javascript:;)). Because IFN-I is widely used in antiviral therapy or the treatment of autoimmune diseases, the side effects are well described and include headache, fever, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, and depression ( [49](javascript:;), [50](javascript:;)). Other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, cause flu-like symptoms, including malaise, fatigue, joint aches, and depression, which often are summarized as sickness behavior ( [51](javascript:;)). The occurrence of side effects after vaccination was shown to correspond with serum cytokine levels ( [52](javascript:;)). Because systemic IFN-I and TNF- responses were not detectable in the serum of RNAdjuvant-treated mice, our results implied that, upon RNAdjuvant treatment, serum cytokine responses, which in humans would mediate adverse effects, were induced to a much lower extent than after treatment with dsRNA-analogs, such as poly(I:C) ( [18](javascript:;), [53](javascript:;)). The massive systemic cytokine responses induced by poly(I:C) early after administration are associated with a rapid distribution of poly(I:C) throughout the body, independent of the administration route, which does not seem to be the case for RNAdjuvant. This observation is surprising, because the average molecular size of the HMW poly(I:C) used in this study is between 1.5 and 8 kb, which is significantly larger than RNAdjuvant, which is 547-bp long. However, unlike poly(I:C), RNAdjuvant contains an additional positively charged carrier component that neutralizes the negative charge of the RNA component. This charge difference between poly(I:C) and RNAdjuvant might account for the divergent in vivo-distribution behavior of the two components. Despite the fact that activation marker upregulation and IFN-I production of RNAdjuvant-treated DCs were TLR7 dependent, the in vivo immunoenhancing effect of RNAdjuvant was only partially abolished in MyD88/ mice devoid of TLR signaling with the exception of TRIF-dependent TLR3. Furthermore, experiments with TRIF/ mice revealed similar immunoenhancing effects as observed in WT mice, indicating that the dsRNA receptor TLR3 was not a critical contributor. Similarly, Cardif/ mice devoid of RLH signaling showed the full immunoenhancing effect of RNAdjuvant. In contrast, MyD88/Cardif/ mice devoid of RLH and TLR signaling, with the exception of TRIF-dependent TLR3 signaling, did not show immunoenhancing effects upon RNAdjuvant plus VLP-VSV vaccination. These results indicated that redundant TLR and RLH signaling conferred RNAdjuvant-mediated enhancement of the IgG switch. RNAdjuvant consists of ssRNA with polyU repeats and a triphosphate at the 5 end (see also [2Materials and Methods](#s2)). Notably, 5-triphosphate RNA ( [54](javascript:;)) and polyU regions of are for activation of RIG-I ( [55](javascript:;)), whereas MDA5 is preferentially activated by long dsRNA with and without triphosphate groups at the 5 end ( [16](javascript:;), [56](javascript:;)). Hence, recognition of RNAdjuvant by TLR7 and RLH is plausible, and structural considerations favor RNAdjuvant triggering RIG-I rather than MDA5. The immunoenhancing effect of RNAdjuvant was entirely lost in the absence of TLR and RLH signaling, whereas the effect was still present, albeit at a reduced level, in mice devoid only of TLR signaling; normal effects were detected in mice deficient in RLH signaling. This was surprising because RNAdjuvant-treated DCs showed TLR7-dependent and Cardif-independent induction of activation markers, as well as TNF- and IFN-I responses. These data imply that, upon RNAdjuvant treatment of mice, TLR7-dependent pathways are more dominant than are Cardif-dependent ones. Obviously, in the absence of TLR7, RLH signaling took over the primary role. Furthermore, it is possible that RNAdjuvant function does not quantitatively rely on triggering of immune cells and that triggering of stroma in secondary lymphoid organs or at the injection site is needed as well. Finally, it is possible that TLR7 primarily triggers IFN-I responses, whereas Cardif plays a role in the induction of other effector functions. The HMW poly(I:C) used in this study as a control is sensed by TLR3 and MDA5 ( [57](javascript:;)). The MDA5-mediated effect of poly(I:C) seems to be dominant, because reduced IgG responses were detected upon VLP-VSV plus poly(I:C) immunization of Cardif/ mice but not TRIF/ mice. In contrast, Cardif/ mice retained the full immunoenhancing effects of RNAdjuvant. These experiments indicated that poly(I:C) and RNAdjuvant conferred immune-enhancing effects by deploying divergent sensing receptors (i.e., TLR3/MDA5 versus TLR7/RIG-I triggering, respectively). Nevertheless, despite the differences in the underlying signaling pathways, poly(I:C) and RNAdjuvant induced IFN-I responses that contributed to a pronounced Th1 skewing. Of note, despite the fact that IFNAR triggering was critical for RNAdjuvant-mediated activation marker upregulation and induction of IFN-I responses, RNAdjuvant still induced a residual immunoenhancing effect in IFNAR-deficient mice that, nevertheless, was reduced compared with that observed in WT mice. Despite the fact that IFN-I was shown to be a natural adjuvant in mice ( [58](javascript:;)), it is less efficacious in humans ( [59](javascript:;)). Thus, the fact that the immunostimulatory effect of RNAdjuvant in mice is not solely mediated by IFNAR signaling makes it a promising candidate for use in humans. Previous studies indicated that adjuvants enhanced immune responses particularly efficiently when at least two molecular pathways were stimulated ( [60](javascript:;), [61](javascript:;)). The combination of and CpG, sensed by TLR2/6, TLR3, and TLR9, respectively, mediated superior effects compared with the single agonists alone ( [62](javascript:;)). Several adjuvant formulations, such as AS04, a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A and alum, are based on the principle that more than one signaling pathway is stimulated ( [8](javascript:;), [63](javascript:;)). Similarly, RNAdjuvant induces strong immunoenhancing activity by activating two signaling platforms, TLR and RLH. Because RNAdjuvant consists of one drug substance, ssRNA complexed with a carrier peptide, product formulation and batch-to-batch consistency can be achieved efficiently. Because most vaccines convey protection by Ab responses ( [64](javascript:;)), our observation was of particular relevance that in a passive immunization setting with JHT/ mice, which are devoid of B cells, serum from VLP-VSV plus RNAdjuvant-vaccinated WT mice showed a protective effect similar to that of HI serum. The detailed subclass analysis revealed that RNAdjuvant enhanced the Th1-mediated switch to IgG2b and 2c. This indicated that RNAdjuvant supported the induction of Th1 responses as similarly observed with poly(I:C) ( [65](javascript:;)), whereas other broadly used merely confer Th2 skewing ( [66](javascript:;)). In summary, the preclinical data presented in this article qualify RNAdjuvant as a promising adjuvant candidate for vaccination against many infectious diseases. Upon local administration, it conferred fulminant immunoenhancing effects without inducing systemic cytokine responses that would cause undesired side effects. It is tempting to speculate that, in particular, seasonal flu vaccines might be improved by formulation with RNAdjuvant, because these vaccines typically do not show optimal efficacy in individuals who would benefit the most from vaccination, the elderly and infants.
