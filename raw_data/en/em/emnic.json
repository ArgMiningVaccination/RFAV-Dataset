Origin - Key Ingredients - Formula - Origin Senna aids natural elimination. A rare white form of Indian jalap is also used to aid natural elimination. Indian jalap, chebulic myrobalan, and Indian laburnum help deliver the other herbs to the desired destinations which boosts absorption for maximum efficiency and enhances comfort. Cabbage rose helps cool the intestines and smooth the effects of all the ingredients\u2014excess heat can decrease the efficiency of both assimilation and elimination. Ayurveda considers daily elimination a prerequisite for good health. In fact, during a visit with an Ayurvedic physician, one of the first questions you will be asked will be about your bowel movements. Irregular elimination allows toxins to build up, causing you to feel off both physically and mentally. Herbal Cleanse was specifically created to gently stimulate the bowel and encourage intestinal cleansing for increased comfort. Our formulations are crafted with care from responsibly sourced botanicals grown in their natural habitat, harvested at their prime time, and prepared in a meticulous, unrushed process. We don't cut corners\u2014many of our products take months to prepare to ensure the proper execution of traditional, authentic Ayurvedic formulations that deliver maximum effect for the mind, body, and emotions. The botanicals in Herbal Cleanse are gathered from pristine, unpolluted areas and grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or exposure to environmental pollutants. Once gathered, the herbs and minerals are sorted and tested to ensure each batch is of the utmost quality. The ingredients are processed so as to not destroy the natural properties of the herbs (no high heat is used during grinding). Reviews Kathleen O. I was diagnosed with a narrowing at the sigmoid junction in my bowels, a common disorder of aging (probably Vata), making it very hard to pass stool. Herbal Cleanse puts things back to normal without any harsh effects, which is more than I can say for over-the-counter remedies. I take two a day most days, but can occasionally skip it. Dried apricots are also very helpful. Rhonda M.
