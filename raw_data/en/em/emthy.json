Keep to normal wak ing and sleeping hours As much as possible support people to go to bed and wake up in line with their usual routine. Facilitate good sleep hygiene by Supporting people to: Wind down before bed (warm bath (not too hot), complete light stretches, listen to relaxing music, co mplete some simple breathing exercises (see attached) Avoid screens for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before bedtime Avoid daytime napping Complete normal bedtime routines get into P.J.'s, brush teeth, wash hands and face, put on creams etc. Ensure sleep environment is helpful (ensure bedroom is dark, quiet, tidy, cool (18 to degrees ) 2. Get dressed In the morning complete usual showering and dressing routine. It helps break the day up when we dress as normal and allows us t o differentiate between daytime and evening. 3. Plan out your day Each day sit down with the person and support them to plan their day. This can be facilitated through use of pictures, objects of reference, talking things through etc. please see guidelines from OT on goal setting and activity planning (Keep Calm and Engage in Meaningful Activities March 2020) . 4. Use a visual schedule Use a visual schedule to help people understand what activities are happening during the day . A visual schedule can use pictures, photographs, or objects. See SLT guidelines for support. 3 5. Get outside Ensure people get outside daily. Keep to social distancing rules but walks, drives, sunlight and nature all benefit mood. Try go to scenic areas like parks, beaches etc. 6. Keep a heathy diet Continue to eat a healthy balanced diet. Boredom and anxiety can often lead to overeating or eating comfort foods. Ensure a balance in diet. Making each mealtime a big activity can help with this. Ensure that meals aren't quick and in front of the T.V. Instead, make mealtimes an event. Consider having themed meals e.g. pancake breakfasts, afternoon tea, Italian night with It alian food, decorations and music. Include the people you support in the planning and set up of these events. 7. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption Alcohol is a depressant and will inevitably lead to lower mood. Avoid excessive consumption. 8. Beware of too much news/conversation/social media While staying informed is essential and will support people's understanding of what is unfolding try to keep information about the virus/quarantine to timed periods during the day e.g. news at lunch and news at 9pm. Try to keep conversations about the virus/quarantine away from the people we support outside of these times. If someone is using a lot of social media, encourage them to check it less frequently during certain hours or activities. 9. Use technology t o connect This will be a very socially isolating time for many of the people we support and will be difficult for many people to not see their family and friends. Use phones, IPads and computers to help people connect with loved ones through skype, f acetime and WhatsApp. Seeing our loved one's faces can really animate a phone call and support a more meaningful connection. 4 10. Start using daily chair yoga/stretching/tai chi There are many tube videos that could be played for people. It is always helpful to have a leader of the yoga/tai chi/stretching so help model the exercises and support others to engage with them. 11. Start using a daily meditation/mindfulness practice Simple breathing techniques can help reduce anxiety. See below for two simple breathing techniques (tummy breathing and take 5). 12. Provide reassurance This is an anxiety provoking time and people are scared, it is important to remind ea ch other that by putting these difficult controls in place that we are protecting ourselves and our loved ones as much as possible. It is important to provide reassurance to each other and stay calm and confident. We are all in this together. Phone call or video call services will be available by the psychology department.

Virtual Journey Around the World 360-degree virtual videos tours around the world ( example: Azores, Sintra, Portugal, etc) younger kids, Older kids, and adults) http://www.airpano.com/360video_list.php 14 Using objects to mark a transition Consult the person's communication matrix sheet - frequently used objects may be listed there. Use an object that is meaningful for that person in relation to the activity (e.g. pad = personal care). Show the object to the person. Say \"time for ............\". Start the activity immediately - bring the object with you to the activity so that the person understands what it represents . Once the activity is done, say \"......... is finished\" and put the object away. It might be helpful to have a \"finished\" bag to put it in. Ensure that this system is used repeatedly and consistently throughout the day. 15 Making choices Consult the person's communication matrix sheet - it will detail whether the person makes a choice from an object, photograph or symbol. Hold up 2 items at a time, preferably a little apart and within the person's field of vision. Name each item in turn - moving each item closer to the person as you name them. Say \"do you want.....or....?\". Watch carefully to see where they rest their gaze, reach or point. OR Place 2 items on the table/tray in front of the person within their reach. Name each item in turn - point to each item as you do so. Say \"do you want ... or ......?\". Watch carefully to see where they rest their gaze, reach or point. Start the activity immediately - bring the object/picture with you to the activity so that the person understands what it represents . Once the activity is done, say \"......... is finished\" and put the object/picture away. It might be helpful to have a \"finished\" bag to put it in. Ensure choices are off ered repeatedly and consistently throughout the day. 16 Visual schedules Consult the person's communication matrix - this will let you know if visual schedules are meaningful for them. Determine how many pictures the person can cope with at a time (i.e. should you present only a portion of the day in pictures or the whole day). Attach pictures of the activities in the order they will happen - decide whether to have the pictures attached before you present them to the person, or whether it helps them to assist you in attaching them. Direct the person's attention to the schedule . Decide whether to go through all items on the schedule with the person or just as each activity starts. Name the activity as you point to the picture. Say \"it's time for ........\". Start the activity immediately - bring the picture to the activity so that the person understands what the picture stands for. Once the first activity is done, say \"......... is finished\" a nd remove it from the schedule . It may be helpful to have a \"finished\" container for the pictures. Then say \" it's time for ............\", pointing to the next picture. Ensure that this system is used repeatedly and consistently throughout the day. Massage Bus Doctor Lunch Bowling 17 First Then Boards First Then Consult the person's communication matrix - this will tell you if first/then is meaningful for them. Attach pictures of the activities in the order they will happen (e.g. \"first wash hands, then dinner\"). It usually helps if the second activity is more motivating than the first. Show the board to the person. Point to each picture in turn saying \"first ........ then ........\" Start the first activity immediately - bring the picture to the activity so that the person understands what the picture stands for. Once the first activity is done, say \"......... is finished\" and remove it from the board. Then say \"now ............\", pointing to the remaining picture. Start the second activity immediately - bring the picture to the activity so that the p erson understands what the picture stands for. Ensure that this system is used repeatedly and consistently throughout the day. 18 Using Lamh *** Refer to the communication matrix on how to support people' communication with others Consult the person's communication matrix sheet - if L\u00e1mh is appropriate, frequently used signs may be listed there. Use a sign that is functional for that person in relation to the activity (e.g. \"drink\"/\"eat\" signs at mealtimes). Speak as you sign to the person but you on ly need to sign one or two key words in the sentence (the information you want to convey most to the person). Sign accurately and clearly. Don't cover your mouth when signing near your face. Start the activity immediately so that the person understands what the sign represents . Ensure that L\u00e1mh is used repeatedly and consistently throughout the day. Consult with SLT if you are unsure of a sign or would like to learn some new ones. 19 Using technology to support people with disabilities, their families and those who support them during the Covid 19 pandemic This is already a very worrying time for people with disabilities, being constantly reminded that they are in a high risk group wh en it comes to Covid 19. With schools and services shut down how can we use technology to facilitate communication, prevent people feeling isolated and maybe provide some kind of distraction? WhatsApp or Viber Groups This is something most of us use and f ind very useful. Disability services could set up a group/groups and use them as a way to keep communication open while people are at home. WhatsApp is very accessible as it allows people to contribute to a group chat using recorded Video or Audio or text. It's a good way to share jokes and funny stories and keep morale up. It supports individual and groups (up to 4) video and audio calls. Advantages Accessible (to many) Familiar Disadvantages Needs a smartphone, computer or tablet. This might be difficult for some people Only supports groups up to 4 in real -time calls or video Echo Dot or Echo Show For some people, speech is the easiest way for them to access technology. The Amazon Alexa powered devices can be a very intuitive way of getting information, e ntertainment (music, radio, audiobooks adventure games). They also support a feature called \"Drop in\". When setting up a device you can add friends or contacts who also have Echo devices and allow them to \"Drop in\". This could provide a good means of keepi ng contact with people who may not be comfortable enough with technology to use a smartphone or WhatsApp. It works basically like an intercom. The person being dropped in on does not have to do anything other than answer, no buttons to press or commands ar e needed. It's like talking to them if they were in the room with you. The Echo Show (only \u00a350 on Amazon at the moment) has a screen and camera also. We are not sure if you can Drop in with video of if you need to use a video calling service. (Maybe someone reading this already knows the answer?) Advantages Very easy to use natural speech interface. Lots of entertainment options Can open communication channels in a natural way with user input 20 Disadvantages GDPR/Privacy/Consent considerations Video Conferencing MICROSOFT TEAMS Microsoft Teams is a hub for teamwork in Office 365. It is currently free to download and use, during this Covid 19 pandemic. It is most likely to be initially at least, most useful to staff, as there is a degree of learning and familiarization involved: Here's an introductory video illustrating how Teams works. SKYPE Skype should be familiar being the original voice and video calling service. Perhaps not as popular as it once was it is still used by many people. Once someone is set up and signed in it should be easy enough to navigate. Skype is keyboard accessible, which wi ll allow us use alternative input methods or create a simplified interface using software like the Grid 3. Unfortunately, Skype no longer supports games like checkers and chess but it is still a good option especially if people are already using it. ZOOM Currently free, the video conferencing tool Zoom is a great way of bringing larger groups together via video. It supports all the main platforms (Windows iOS, Android and MacOS). It's quite an easy app to use and is free t o install and use for up to 40 minutes. This could be used to bring everyone together at a certain time every day and would be probably the best way of simulating the atmosphere people would be familiar with within the services they normally attend. When h osting a meeting, you can select 'share screen only' to ensure that the there is no potential for making any changes to attendees' own devices. Without selecting this feature, it would be possible to remotely access devices, and this is something that woul d require written/recorded consent. Note: Corporate IT Departments may have concerns re: this solution as they may not have any prior agreement with them. So for service providers, best to check with IT before considering it. Advantages Free and relatively easy to use Supports large group video calls Great casting tool Disadvantage GDPR concerns Requires a computer or mobile device Will be new and unfamiliar to most (all) 21 Set up an Internet Radio Station There are services that allow you create an online ra dio station (for example https://radio.co/ ). This would be a great way of keeping people in touch with news and entertainment custom made for a specific audience. Rotate DJs between services, have chats, play music, share news. Bit of a mad idea but could be fun for everyone. If a live radio channel is a bit of a stretch we could maybe produce a daily podcast. Get people to record introduction to songs on their phones and send us the audio. Record thoughts, news, jokes, and we can try to put it all together and send out a link for everyone to listen. Video could also be used and make private links on YouTube. Advantages Accessible to (almost) all as listeners Offers opportunity to be producer as well as consumer of news/ente rtainment All content curated by surface users Disadvantages Totally new to us, not sure of the requirements for setting it up but happy to hear from others more familiar, and happy to try it out. Watch Together YouTube is very popular and supports synchro nised watching of YouTube videos and real -time chat. Watch Together https://www.watch2gether.com/?lang=en Online Games There are lots of games available online that allow you invite friends to play rem otely. Why not curate and manage a range? Suited to Draughts, Battleship , Ludo, Scrabble, Chess although younger players might be more interested in Fortnite Advantages Many of these games will be fa miliar to people already Great distraction; Start a league! Disadvantages Many of the sites that offer these games are funded by advertising and can be difficult to navigate (auto playing videos, links to products, flashing ads designed to trick people into clicking on them. This is not an insurmountable problem but it would be a good bit of work identifying appropriate platforms. iOS might be better. VIRTUAL PHOTO WALKS This is a lovely idea we came across. The original uses Google Hangouts but any video conferencing app would work.
