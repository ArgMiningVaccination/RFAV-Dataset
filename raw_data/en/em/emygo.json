Therefore, development of safe and clinically effective therapeutic vaccines is an important goal. Herein, we show that a recombinant fusion protein of a humanized antibody to CD40 fused to HPV16.E6/7 (CD40-HPV16.E6/7) CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses in head-and-neck cancer patients in vitro and in human CD40 transgenic (hCD40Tg) mice in vivo. The combination of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 and poly(I:C) efficiently primed HPV16.E6/7-specific T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, in hCD40Tg mice. Inclusion of montanide enhanced CD4+, but not CD8+, T-cell responses. Poly(I:C) plus CD40-HPV16.E6/7 was sufficient to mount both preventative and therapeutic immunity against TC-1 tumors in hCD40Tg mice, significantly increasing the frequency of HPV16-specific CD8+ CTLs in the tumors, but not in peripheral blood. In line with this, tumor volume inversely correlated with the frequency of HPV16.E6/7-specific CD8+ T cells in tumors, but not in blood. These data suggest that CD40-targeting vaccines for HPV-associated malignancies can provide a highly immunogenic platform with a strong likelihood of clinical benefit. Data from this study offer strong support for the development of CD40-targeting vaccines for other cancers in the future. Cancer 4(10); 823-34. \u00a92016 AACR. Introduction Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with most sexually active individuals acquiring HPV. Approximately 79 million people are currently infected with HPV, and 14 million are newly infected each year in the United States ( [1, 2](javascript:;)). Of the more than 150 different types of HPV ( [3](javascript:;)), high-risk HPV strains (HPV16 and 18) are strongly associated with many cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, and anus ( [4, 5](javascript:;)). Up to 22% of adults are HPV16-seropositive, but most primary infections are cleared without sequelae ( [6-8](javascript:;)). The clinical observations are similar for HPV18. However, in a small but significant proportion of individuals, their immune systems fail to eradicate the virus and it becomes latent. Such persistent infection can lead to cancers. A recent U.S. population-based study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 66% of cervical cancers, 55% of vaginal cancers, 79% of anal cancers, and 62% of oropharyngeal cancers are attributable to HPV16 or 18. Each year in the United States, an estimated 26,000 new cancers are attributable to HPV, about 17,000 in women and 9,000 in men ( [9](javascript:;)). Among these cancers, HPV-associated head-and-neck cancers, including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, have recently risen dramatically in men under 50 years old, whereas the incidence of HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers has decreased ( [10](javascript:;)). Although many of the HPV-positive tumors can be cured with modern multidisciplinary treatment approaches, development of new and effective therapeutic vaccines against HPV-associated malignancies is of importance to bring better benefit to the patients. HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 drive malignant transformation by inactivating the p53 and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor genes ( [11](javascript:;)). Such tumor-associated antigens (TAA, E6/7) of viral origin are constitutively expressed in HPV-infected nonmalignant and malignant cells. As a consequence, E6 and E7 are ideal immunotherapeutic target antigens to evoke cellular immune responses, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which are the major effector cells that kill tumors. These unique characteristics of HPV-associated malignancies, which are distinct from many other cancers where TAAs are of host origin, provide an opportunity to develop effective immunotherapeutic vaccines. Several candidate vaccines are currently being investigated, including E6- and/or In addition to potential safety concerns for some of these vaccine models, especially for immune-compromised individuals, eliciting robust CD8+ CTL-mediated immunity still remains a major challenge ( [24-26](javascript:;)). Among various types of antigen presenting cells (APC), dendritic cells (DC) are the most efficient at cross-presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells ( [27, 28](javascript:;)). This ability of DCs makes them ideal cellular targets for the rational design of cancer vaccines. Indeed, targeting antigen to DCs via their surface receptors using conjugates of anti-DC surface receptor and antigen can result in greatly enhanced cellular immunity ( [29](javascript:;)). We have found that targeting antigens to DCs via CD40 results in greater antigen-specific CD8+ CTLs than targeting to any of nine other DC surface receptors tested ( [30](javascript:;)). It is therefore reasonable to test whether an immunotherapeutic vaccine designed to target CD40 has the potential to bring clinical benefit to HPV-associated cancer patients. In this study, we assessed the preclinical efficacy of a CD40-targeting vaccine for HPV16-associated malignancies in patients in vitro and human CD40 transgenic (hCD40Tg) mice in vivo. Data from this study support the development of a CD40-targeting immunotherapeutic vaccine for HPV-associated malignancies. Materials and Methods Antibodies, peptides, tetramers, and other reagents Antibodies and tetramers used are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. IL2, IL7, and IL15 were purchased from PeproTech. Overlapping 15-mer peptides (staggered by 11 amino acids) spanning the entire HPV16.E6 and HPV16.E7 proteins and human prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were purchased from Mimotopes. Poly(I:C) was purchased from Invivogen. Montanide ISA 51 was from SEPPIC. Mouse CD8+ T-cell (negative) and CD4+ T-cell (positive) enrichment were purchased from StemCell. mAb to CD40 and CD40-HPV16.E6/7 fusion protein (clone 12E12), specific of CD40 (clone 12E12) mAb was verified by its specific binding to human CD40 expressed on CHO cells transfected with the full-length human CD40 (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) and by ELISA by measuring its binding to the recombinant human CD40-Fc fusion protein (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Recombinant fusion protein of CD40 and HPV16.E6/7 has been described: CD40VH2-HPV16.E6/7 (GenBank KP684039) paired with the corresponding light chain CD40VK2-hIgGK sequence within KM660792. Human IgG4 heavy chains with two site mutations (S228P and L235E; ref. [32](javascript:;)) were made to further abolish non-specific binding to Fc receptors and to stabilize the labile C-C bond typical of IgG4. Recombinant CD40VH2-HPV16.E6/7 was expressed in stable CHO-S transfectants and purified by protein A column chromatography. Endotoxin levels were less than 0.02 units/mL. The sequence of IgG4 of the control IgG4-HPV16.E6/7 has been described ( [31](javascript:;)). Human cells, cell culture medium, and in vitro experiments All human samples were acquired in accordance with the protocol that was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Baylor Research Institute (BRI) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. PBMCs were enriched from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare). Complete RPMI 1640 (Gibco; Supplementary Materials and Methods) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Gemini) was used in human in vitro experiments. Mice and immunization Six- to 10-week-old female wild-type (C57BL/6) and hCD40Tg mice (C56BL/6 background; ref. [30](javascript:;)) were used. All mouse experiments were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at BRI. Animals were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) on days 0, 14, and 28, with 100 L phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) containing 30 g mAb-HPV16.E6/7 fusion proteins (CD40-HPV16.E6/7 or IgG4-HPV16.E6/7) plus 50 g poly(I:C). In the experiment testing the effect of Montanide ISA 51 VG, water-in-oil (1:1, v/v) emulsions were prepared. All animals were euthanized 7 days after the third immunization. Spleens and blood were collected for assessing HPV16.E6/7-specific T-cell assay Mouse Mabtech. ELISpot assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Details can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods. TC-1 tumor model A total of 2 \u00d7 104 TC-1 tumor cells (kindly provided by Dr. T.C. Wu at Johns Hopkins University in May 2013) were authenticated by detecting HPV16.E6/7 proteins with Western blot analysis. Cell lines used in these experiments were passaged a maximum of 4 times before implanted s.c. in the left flank of the mice (marked as day 0). TC-1 cells were also tested for Mycoplasma contamination. Animals were treated s.c. with 30 g CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus 50 g poly(I:C) in 100 L PBS via the indicated routes. In separate experiments, animals bearing tumors (100-200 mm3) were treated s.c. or by intratumoral (i.t.) injection with 5 doses (at 6-day intervals) of 30 g CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus 50 g poly(I:C). For testing the preventative efficacy of the vaccine, animals were immunized s.c. with 30 g CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus 50 g poly(I:C) on days 0, 14, and 28. TC-1 tumor cells (2 \u00d7 104) were implanted s.c. on indicated days. Tumor volumes were measured twice every week. Removed tumors were processed with Mouse Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) to generate single-cell suspensions. Statistical analysis Primary methods of data analysis included descriptive statistics (means \u00b1 SD). Differences between the two groups were detected using the Student t test or ANOVA. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Results CD40-HPV16.E6/7 recombinant fusion protein A recombinant fusion protein of humanized CD40 antibody (12E12) and HPV16.E6/7 (CD40-HPV16.E6/7) was generated as described ( [31, 33, 34](javascript:;)). The fusion protein CD40-HPV16.E6/7 carries the heavy chain C-terminus analyzed by SDS-PAGE [Fig. 1B](javascript:;), right). All proteins were expressed by CHO-S cells and purified by protein A affinity chromatography ( [30, 31, 33, 34](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Human were stained with amounts (0.01-10 g/mL) of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 or control IgG4-HPV16.E6/7. CD40-HPV16.E6/7 bound to CHO-hCD40 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas IgG4-HPV16.E6/7 did not (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Neither CD40-HPV16.E6/7 nor IgG4-HPV16.E6/7 bound to CHO cells transfected with a mock plasmid (data not shown). CD40-HPV16.E6/7 also bound to blood CD11c+ myeloid DCs, while IgG4-HPV16.E6/7 did not. Similarly, CD40-HPV16.E6/7 could bind to blood B cells and plasmacytoid DCs, but not to T cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Taken together, CD40-HPV16.E6/7 can bind to CD40 and can thus efficiently target APCs, including DCs, at the concentrations (0.02-2 g/mL) tested. CD40-HPV16.E6/7 activates specific peripheral T cells from cancer patients To test whether CD40-HPV16.E6/7 can activate E6/7-specific T cells from HPV16+ head-and-neck cancer patients, PBMCs were cultured for 7 days in the presence of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 (0.2 g/mL) or an equimolar amount of E6/7 peptide pool. Cells were then restimulated for 48 hours with E6/7 peptide pool or control peptides. Both CD40-HPV16.E6/7 and an E6/7 peptide pool could expand E6/7-specific IFN-producing T cells ( [Fig. 1C](javascript:;)). They produced significant amounts of IFN in response to E6/7 peptide pool, but not to control peptides. These data were from experiments performed with PBMCs from 10 patients ( [Fig. 1D](javascript:;)). We greater numbers of E6/7-specific IFN+CD8+ and IFN+CD4+ T cells, demonstrating that CD40-HPV16.E6/7 could efficiently activate both E6/7-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. There was no significant response by E6/7-specific CD8+ T cells without targeting the protein antigens. Therefore, CD40-HPV16.E6/7 can efficiently activate HPV16.E6/7-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from the blood of head-and-neck cancer patients. CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) can prime CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vivo We assessed the immunogenicity of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 with hCD40Tg mice ( [30](javascript:;)). Three s.c. doses of 30 g CD40-HPV16.E6/7 alone did not elicit significant HPV16.E6/7-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell responses, as assessed by measuring the frequency of H-2Db-E749-57 tetramer+ CD8+ T cells [Fig. 2B](javascript:;)). However, a combination of 30 g CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus 50 g poly(I:C) ( [35](javascript:;)) resulted CD4+ and Most CD8+ T cells primed with CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) were specific to peptide cluster 5 from the HPV16.E7 (Supplementary Fig. S3A), as reported ( [36](javascript:;)), whereas CD4+ T cells were mainly specific to peptide cluster 2 from HPV16.E6 protein (Supplementary Fig. S3B). [Close modal](javascript:;) We chose poly(I:C) as an adjuvant based on our in vitro data (Supplementary Fig. S3) and published data ( [35](javascript:;)). Human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDC) were loaded with 1 CD40-Flu.M1 (matrix protein 1 of influenza virus, PR8, H1N1; ref. [30](javascript:;)) and then activated overnight CL075, a TLR7/8 agonist. Purified autologous CD8+ T cells were cocultured for 7 days with the DCs. Compared with CL075, poly(I:C) resulted in enhanced Flu.M1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, as assessed by measuring the frequency of HLA-A2-Flu.M158-66 tetramer+ CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and IFN+CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Poly(I:C), compared with CL075 or no adjuvant, resulted in similar or increased expression of granzyme B (Supplementary Fig. S4C) and perforin (Supplementary Fig. S4D) in the CD8+ T-cell responses tested whether montanide could further enhance the CD40-HPV16.E6/7-induced T-cell responses in vivo. Two groups of hCD40Tg animals (4 mice per group) were immunized s.c. with CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) in either PBS or an emulsion of PBS and montanide (1:1 ratio, v/v). Animals were ELISpot data ( [Fig. not promote responses. a significant HPV-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell response (data not shown). can promote CD40 and evoked strong specific T-cell responses We investigated whether the HPV16.E6/7-specific CD8+ T-cell responses elicited with CD40-HPV16.E6/7 were the result of its specific targeting to human CD40 in vivo. CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) elicited in hCD40Tg, but not in wild-type animals, as assessed by measuring the frequency of H-2Db-E749-57 tetramer+CD8+ T cells in responses only in the hCD40Tg animals. CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) was also more efficient than control IgG4-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) We concluded that CD40-HPV16.E6/7 targets CD40 and can thus efficiently evoke HPV16-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in hCD40Tg mice. by CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) against TC-1 tumors We assessed the efficacy of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) in the prevention of TC-1 tumor growth in hCD40Tg animals. Animals were first immunized s.c. with a combination of 30 g CD40-HPV16.E6/7 and 50 g poly(I:C) three times at 2-week intervals. Animals were then divided into two groups (5 mice per group). One group of animals was implanted s.c. with TC-1 tumor cells 1 week after the third immunization (day 35). The other group was implanted with TC-1 tumor cells 2 months after the final immunization (day 90). Unimmunized animals were used as controls. All control animals died within 35 days after TC-1 tumor cell implantation ( [Fig. 4A](javascript:;)). In contrast, all animals in the two experimental groups survived until the end of the experiment. Consistent with these survival data, all control animals showed rapid progression of tumor growth that reached a tumor volume of 1,000 mm3 within 35 days after TC-1 tumor cell implantation, whereas animals in the two experimental groups showed no tumor growth or significantly delayed progression of TC-1 tumor growth ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) In a separate experiment, we assessed the frequency of HPV16.E6/7-specific T-cell memory in the spleens of animals that received three doses of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C). One group of mice was euthanized 1 week after the final immunization (day 35), the other 2 months after the final immunization (day 90). The frequency of HPV16.E7-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleens of the two groups were not significantly different, although the HPV16.E7-specific CD8+ T-cell memory tended to decay over time 4C](javascript:;)). The frequencies of HPV16.E6/7-specific IFN+CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the spleens of the two groups were also not significantly different ( [Fig. 4D](javascript:;)). Thus, the combination of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) can mount preventative immunity against TC-1 tumor growth and HPV16.E6/7-specific T-cell memory in hCD40Tg animals. Therapeutic immunity by CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) against TC-1 tumors To assess the therapeutic efficacy of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C), hCD40Tg mice were first implanted s.c. with TC-1 tumor cells and then immunized s.c., intraperitoneally (i.p.), or intramuscularly (i.m.) with CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C). Ten mice in each group were treated once every 6 days until day 36. Treatment began on day 6 after TC-1 tumor implant when the mice had palpable-sized tumors ( [Fig. 5A](javascript:;)). Regardless of the injection routes, CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) substantially increased overall survival, with 90% of mice of each immunized group still alive at the end of the experiment, compared with survival of only 10% of mice in the unimmunized group ( [Fig. 5B](javascript:;)). Tumor progression in the majority of immunized mice was also suppressed, with some mice showing tumor rejection after the fourth, fifth, or sixth immunization ( [Fig. 5C](javascript:;)). Tumor rejection was confirmed with surgeries. Thus, CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) could mount therapeutic immunity against TC-1 tumors. The TC-1 tumors started regrowing, particularly in the animals that did not reject the tumors, when the treatment was stopped, although the tumor growth rate in these mice was slower than that in unimmunized animals. Poly(I:C) alone did not result in enhanced survival or suppression of tumor growth (data not shown). [Close modal](javascript:;) To further understand the therapeutic immunity evoked with CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C), we assessed the frequencies of tetramer+CD8+ T cells in the tumors as well as in the peripheral blood of immunized and unimmunized mice. TC-1 cells were implanted on day 0 and then animals received 3 s.c. doses of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) once every 6 days starting from day 6. Mice were euthanized whenever they had large tumor volumes (>1,500 mm3), significant body weight loss (>20%), hunched backs, or significantly diminished activity. Based on these criteria, all mice in the unimmunized group were euthanized within 35 days after TC-1 tumor implantation. In contrast, all mice in the immunized group were euthanized between days 40 and 75\u2014mostly on day 75 when the experiment was finished. [Figure 5D](javascript:;) (top) shows that animals immunized with the vaccine had significantly higher frequencies of HPV16.E7-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumors than the unimmunized mice. The frequencies of blood HPV16.E7-specific CD8+ T cells between the two groups of animals, however, were not significantly different ( [Fig. 5D](javascript:;), bottom). Importantly, the frequencies of tetramer+CD8+ T cells in the tumors inversely correlated with the tumor volumes only in the immunized group ( [Fig. 5E](javascript:;), bottom). The frequencies of tetramer+CD8+ T cells in the blood and tumor volumes were not significantly associated in either group of animals ( [Fig. 5F](javascript:;)). Collectively, we concluded that CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) HPV16.E6/7-specific CD8+ T-cell-mediated therapeutic immunity to control HPV16.E6/7-expressing TC-1 tumor progression. The efficacy of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) was further investigated using animals bearing tumors (100-200 mm3; [Fig. 6](javascript:;)). In this experiment, hCD40Tg animals were treated with 30 g CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus 50 g poly(I:C) per dose once tumor volumes reached at least 100 mm3. All control animals (without treatment) died within 20 days ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;)). In contrast, treatment with CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) via either s.c. or i.t. route resulted in enhanced survival rates, although s.c. resulted in a greater survival rate than the i.t. route. Thus, CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) could effectively inhibit of TC-1 tumors ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Discussion Safe and effective therapeutic vaccines for HPV-associated malignancies will be highly beneficial for patients, including those who receive modern multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches. Currently available FDA-approved preventative vaccines do not provide therapeutic immunity against HPV-associated cancers. We therefore tested a new prototype vaccine, CD40-HPV16.E6/7, for HPV16-associated malignancies in this study. Although there is still much work that needs to be done to bring this vaccine model to patients, we could demonstrate that this protein-based prototype vaccine CD40-HPV16.E6/7 is highly immunogenic in patients in vitro and in hCD40Tg mice in vivo. These data strongly support our continuing investigation of this new vaccine model in different settings, which can lead us to test this vaccine model in patients in the near future. CD40-HPV16.E6/7 carries both E61-120 and E71-60. It could thus elicit broad repertoires of E6/7-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in patients. This may overcome one of the major limitations of HLA epitope-based peptide vaccines, which is that a specific vaccine is useful for only patients who express the corresponding HLA types. In line with this notion, CD40-HPV16.E6/7 could activate HPV16.E6/7-specific T cells in the blood of head-and-neck cancer patients tested in this study. Peptide vaccines composed of overlapping peptides covering the majority of TAA could overcome such limitations of HLA epitope-based peptide vaccines. However, a long peptide-based immunotherapy by itself does not exert an effective therapeutic action in patients with established HPV-associated cervical cancer ( [14, 24](javascript:;)). This could be due to an increased induction of FoxP3-positive HPV-specific (regulatory) T cells, immunoediting, including downregulation of MHC class I molecules or processing molecules, and failure of effector T cells to properly home into cancer tissues. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in these patients can also preclude the efficacy of long peptide vaccine ( [37](javascript:;)). Such MDSC-mediated immune suppression could be alleviated by depleting MDSC by timed vaccination during standard carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy ( [37](javascript:;)). It was also notable that CD40-HPV16.E6/7 was more efficient than an HPV16.E6/7 peptide pool (15-mers overlapping 11 amino acids) at activating HPV16.E6/7-specific IFN-producing T cells in some of the patients tested in this study. Both patients in vitro and hCD40Tg mice in vivo data also confirmed that targeted delivery of HPV16.E6/7 to CD40 was far more efficient than nontargeted delivery at eliciting HPV16.E6/7-specific T-cell responses, as we have previously demonstrated ( [30](javascript:;)). This protein-based vaccine model would be better suited for immune-compromised patients, including patients who are coinfected with HIV, than a live vector-based vaccine model. HPV-associated cancers, particularly cervical cancer in women and anal cancer in men who have sex with men ( [38, 39](javascript:;)), are major HIV-related malignancies. Thus, the development of an effective and safe therapeutic vaccine against HPV-associated cancers in HIV patients is of importance. The ability of a vaccine to evoke strong cellular immunity, particularly CD8+ CTL-mediated immunity, is one of the key components that could determine the efficacy of the vaccine against cancers, including HPV-associated malignancies. For the purpose of evoking strong CD8+ CTL-mediated immunity, this prototype vaccine was designed to target CD40, which was based on our previous studies ( [30, 31](javascript:;)). After receptor-mediated antigen uptake, CD40 mainly localizes to the early endosomes and the plasma membrane, where the stability of the antigens it carries can be enhanced, leading to prolonged antigen presentation and enhanced CD8+ T-cell responses, as we and others have previously reported ( [30, 40, 41](javascript:;)). CD40-HPV16.E6/7 used in this study could not induce DCs to secrete increased amounts of cytokine and chemokine or to induce surface phenotype maturation ( [30](javascript:;)). This was in line with the previous observation ( [40](javascript:;)) that the enhanced antigen cross-presentation by CD40-targeted DCs was not due to the CD40-mediated activation signals. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5A, the addition of an agonistic anti-CD40 significantly The specificity of clone confirmed by staining CHO cells transfected with hCD40 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). It can bind to MoDCs (Supplementary Fig. S4C) and activate human B cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D). We have previously demonstrated that DCs are the major APCs that lead to antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses when antigens were targeted cells and monocytes express CD40 ( [30, 31](javascript:;)). This study provides a proof-of-concept for the immunogenicity and efficacy of our prototype vaccine made with humanized CD40 mAb. However, a few experiments might need to be performed before testing this vaccine model in patients. First, it would be valuable to explore methods that can further improve the immunogenicity and efficacy of this prototype vaccine. In this study, we used poly(I:C) as an adjuvant. This was based on our data as well as on the data from previous studies ( [35](javascript:;)). As a part of our efforts to enhance T-cell responses, we tested whether montanide could further promote the vaccine-induced T-cell responses. It promoted CD4+ T-cell responses but not CD8+ T-cell responses. If this is the case in humans, montanide might improve efficacy of this vaccine model in patients because of the critical roles of CD4+ T cells in the maintenance of CD8+ CTLs ( [42-44](javascript:;)). Other DC activators, including TLR7/8 ligands, particularly in the form of conjugates to the prototype vaccine, might also promote CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunity, as described previously ( [45, 46](javascript:;)). Second, the route of immunization could be important in patients, although s.c., i.p., and i.m. delivery of CD40-HPV16.E6/7 plus poly(I:C) resulted in similar outcomes in mice. Alternatively, an experimental protocol using non-human primates (NHP) may provide us with better insights for the selection of an optimal immunization route for evoking strong CD8+ T-cell responses. Such experiments in NHPs could also provide us with better insights for E6/7-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses by assessing single peptide epitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response, respectively, if possible. Although we and others use the TC-1 tumor model in C57BL/6 mice, it is also important to note that CD8+ CTL responses elicited in these mice are limited mainly to one epitope (E7RAHYNIVTF). This will not be the case in humans, indicating that the efficacy of vaccines tested in the TC-1 tumor model does not necessarily reflect the efficacy in patients. The efficacy of this vaccine model needs to be investigated in patients once the vaccine regimen and immunization route are optimized. Third, it is also important to test whether this vaccine model is capable of evoking mucosal CD8+ CTL-mediated immunity. This might be one of the most important and relevant tasks for the successful development of vaccines against HPV-associated cancers in the mucosa. This question will need to be addressed in the context of the selection of an optimal immunization route as well as choosing appropriate adjuvants. Lastly, the efficacy of this vaccine model might be improved by harnessing tumor immune evasion mechanisms. Although HPV-induced tumors in different mucosal tissues might possess distinct inhibitory mechanisms in patients (and these need to be further studied), recent data suggest that antibodies specific for immune checkpoint inhibitors ( [47-50](javascript:;)), including CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, might also improve the efficacy of this vaccine model in patients with HPV-associated malignancies. In summary, we have presented a new immunotherapeutic vaccine model for HPV16-associated malignancies in this study. Although several key experiments remain to be performed, data from this study strongly suggest that this vaccine model has a high potential to provide patients with improved clinical benefits in the future. In addition, data from this and previous studies ( [30, 31, 40, 41](javascript:;)) strongly support the development of CD40-targeting vaccines for the treatment of other cancers.
