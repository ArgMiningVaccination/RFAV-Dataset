Our mission is to understand genetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and to translate these insights to enhance risk prediction, diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. To achieve these goals, we integrate human genomic analyses with functional investigation in fruit fly models of neurodegenerative disease. Our innovative strategy is revealing genetic pathways of cognition and motor control, and their impact in the aging brain. Lab Location The laboratory is located in the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurologic Research Institute situated centrally within the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest academic medical campus, including Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and many other outstanding institutions. The NRI is a 13 floor, 350,000 square foot, state-of-the-art research center dedicated to basic and translational investigation of neurological disorders. "}
