Common warts directly affect quality of life of the patients causing embarrassment, psychological trauma due to frustration of persistence and recurrence even after long continued treatment. There are many modes of treatment - surgical curettage, cautery, caustic ablation, cryotherapy, hot water infrared coagulation, immunotherapy, laser, virucidal, antimitotic therapy. However, all these therapy show high recurrence rates, persistence and transmission of the virus, formation of scars/Koebners. In fact, a recent updated Cochrane review concluded the treatment modes are only providing useful ideas only. Solanum Dulcamara also known as bitter sweet or climbing nightshade is a subshrub plant saponins and agents are well known for their antimicrobial actions. I convinced after a pilot study that the ultra diluted extract of this plant could cure the disease as observed in a long follow up of some patients. In this main study we treated 190 patients suffering from common warts mostly in the age group between 10-40 years with this ultra diluted extract. There was cure of 78% patients as observed in a long time follow up. The satisfactory results were not obtained in palmo-planter and digital varieties and if we exclude these patients then the success rate becomes very high indicating it a promising medicine for treatment of these patients in days to come.

St. Xaviers University, India Verruca Vulgaris occurs due to infection caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Replication of HPV is closely associated with epithelial differentiation. More than 200 genotypes of HPV having tissue tropism are involved in development of a moderate range of benign tumors affecting the skin and they occasionally lead to the development of malignant tumors particularly Squamous Cell carcinoma. Benign Neoplasia mainly associated HPV-40 genotypes. Episomal viral genome ( ds DNA) enters the nuclei of multiplying basal cells and the infected progeny promote the neoplastic proliferation during keratinocyte differentiation. Integrin receptors, syndecan-1 and TRAPPIII complex are involved at the entry portal of the viruses particularly in basal cells. Later viral assembly and release mainly occurs by L1,L2,E4 gene often crosstalk with the Hippo pathway signaling molecules and EGFR with up regulation of IL6, IL8, IL10 of IL1-, IL18, IL2, TNF- and -IFN are also found. Due to restricted growth clinically Verruca Vulgaris is characterized by hyperkeratotic, exophytic, dome shaped papules or nodules. The lesions are sessile, verrucous and with distinct borders. HPV-16 is notorious for development of skin cancers due to expression of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 by activation of E genes and evade protective roles of oncogenes. Genital warts are mainly caused by HPV-11 and HPV-6 without any specificity of their lineages and sublineages although HPV-11 A2 variant is most frequently associated with genital warts.

POLA Chemical Industries Inc., Japan Histological examination of normal human skin demonstrates that the Stratum Corneum (SC) comprises of two layers: an upper layer with a basket-weave pattern, and a lower compact layer. The basket-weave SC includes peripheral Corneo Desmosomes (CDs), an adhesion structure of the SC, resulting in expansion of the intracellular space where intercellular lipids can spread widely. In this study, the relationship between degradation of CDs, which is a necessary process for maturing basket-weave SC, and physical properties of the skin in 98 healthy Japanese female subjects was investigated. The outermost Corneocytes were obtained by tapestripping, then degradation of Desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), a major and important component of CDs, was examined using Immunofluorescence microscopy. We found a significant positive correlation between the number of Dsg1 pixels and transepidermal water loss and a significant negative correlation between the number of Dsg1 pixels and the high-frequency conductance of the skin. Subjects with higher degradation of Dsg1, which indicates basket-weave SC, tended to show a higher SC barrier function and a higher SC hydration, respectively. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between the number of Dsg1 pixels and a change in resonant frequency state as determined by measurement with a tactile sensor. That is, subjects with higher Dsg1 degradation, indicating basket-weave SC, tended to show a softer SC. We tried to improve basket-weave SC to improve the physiological properties of the skin. Prepared emulsion-A, an oil-in-water emulsion, successfully generated the basket-weave SC in reconstructed human epidermis in which degradation of CDs was promoted. The intercellular space of the basket-weave SC generated by emulsion-A was filled with multilamellar lipid sheets. These results indicate that degradation of CDs is likely to play an important role in maintaining the physiological properties of the skin in healthy subjects.

Total Charm Clinic, Georgia Introduction: Acne is rather common problem of fatty gland inflammation caused by the pathological process, based on numerous factors; whereby different type rash develops on the skin, such as Comedone, Papule-Pustules, Nodules-Cysts. Any type of acne can leave scars (atrophic or hypertrophic) and spots on the skin, which are not easy to remove. There are many treatment methods (ultrasonic, microwave, IPL- methods, etc.) used to solve this problem, but it is hard to reach fully clearness. We use dermabrasion and chemical peeling methods for acne spots and scars with very good result. Goal: To study the efficacy of minimal invasive methods - Microdermabrasion and Chemical Peeling for treatment of Post Acne Scars and Spots. Material and Methods: We studied 47 acne patients. The patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 included 23 patients with post-acne scars (hypotrophic form), out of which 16 female and 7 male of 24 to 36 years of age. Scars were 1-8 years old. The group 2, was composed by 17 patients (15 female and 2 male) with relatively new, 4-12 months old, post-acne spots. The group 3 consisted of patients with-acne spots and minimal hypotrophic scars. There were 7 female patients of 19 to 28 years old. In the first Group the superficial anesthesia with the ointment by 5% Lidocaine was done, the skin was cleaned by Chlorhexidine solution and each scar was treated by microcrystalline surface mounts, with sizes ranging from 75 microns (in case of old and rough edges, if any) up to 125-150-170-microns (compared to new-soft scars). The procedure was repeated 4-6 times with 10 day intervals. The procedure may be repeated 6-12 months later. The skin exfoliation was done by the device and blood circulation was improved and tissues were enriched by oxygen, the restructuration of the damaged part was done. In the Group 2 the skin was treated with combined chemical acids (14% salicylic acid, 15% salicylic acid 30%, glycolic acid 50-70% may be used for evaluation of the spot condition. The procedure included 4 procedures with 12-14 day intervals. The procedure may be repeated 6-12 months later. The follow-up period included up to 3-14 months. Efficiency was based on long-term results. In the group 3 the skin was treated by ultrasonic one procedure per week over all 8 procedures and microwave two procedures per week over all 8 procedures. After 3 months of treatment the results were insignificant. Results: In each group skin condition changed dramatically, its structure improved, the skin color became pale pink, porosity of the skin reduced, the collagen-elastin synthesis, skin layer regeneration, restructuration occurred through improvement of blood circulation and exfoliation. Conclusion: The obtained results showed that the procedures done by apparatus Microdermabrasion and Chemical peeling are very effective for further resolution of Post-Acne Scars and Spots.

Avon Products, USA Cutaneous aging is a complex process involving a series of cellular and extracellular matrix events. The dermal matrix of the skin plays a pivotal role during this process. Studies by us and other investigators have consistently found that dermal matrix progressively degrades throughout a persons life. The manifestation of this progressive reduction of dermal matrix is the loss of skin elasticity, which may in turn lead to gradual appearing and/or deepening of facial lines, wrinkles and increased sagging. It was postulated that enhancing dermal matrix protein production, assembly and stabilization can contribute to improve facial volume and firmness over time, thereby slowing down the appearance of skin aging. To investigate this possibility, a screen of synthetic substances and medicinal herbs was conducted to identify cosmetically acceptable substances that can influence the production and stabilization of dermal matrices. We identified a substance that showed strong stimulatory effect on dermal matrix components, such as Collagen and Hyaluronic acid in an in vitro model. Subsequently, a placebo controlled clinical split-facestudy, which was assessed by bio-instruments, showed that a 4-week of treatment of panelists with this substance could improve skin firmness as well as other skin conditions. Examination of skin biopsies with the treatment of this substance revealed the increased epidermal thickness in addition to dermal matrix improvement. To elucidate the mechanism of action of this substance, we conducted gene array study. In this presentation, our findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies will be shown and discussed.

Mezzo Anti-Age Clinic, Ukraine Leishmaniasis is an endemic disease which is caused by the protozoan Leishmania, parasites which are transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sand flies that affects some of the poorest people on earth and is associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor hygiene, a weak immune system and lack of public health services. Leishmaniasis is divided into two It is estimated by WHO that between 600 000 to 1 million new cases of Leishmaniasis occur worldwide annually. Which is over two thirds of new CL cases occurred in 6 countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, Iran and Syria. CL is the most common form of Leishmaniasis in Afghanistan, a disease with varying clinical presentation with a mild dermal condition usually self-healing, but the resulting scaring could be extremely disfiguring leading to social and psychological stigma. CL usually produces ulcers on the exposed parts of the body, such as the face, arms and legs. Despite the great efforts by health authorities in Afghanistan CL continues to be a major public health problem in the country nevertheless, CL is not a fatal disease it can be cured only if the symptoms are treated in early stage. Biography: Abdullah Naqibullah is a Dermatologist and Cosmetologist from Afghanistan. He obtained his masters degree in Dermatology and Cosmetology in 2017 from Kharkiv National Medical University Ukraine. Presently he is working as a Dermatologist and Laser Specialist in Mezzo Anti-Age clinic at Kiev, Ukraine. Estetic Lounge Ludwigshafen, Germany 1. Cellulite describes the scalp-like retraction of the skin in post-pubertal women and is often associated with a change in the subcutaneous adipose tissue at the thigh and buttocks area. Men have a significantly different, cross-linked connective tissue structure from women, which is why cellulite occurs almost exclusively in women due to the typical parallel connective tissue. In advanced age occurs in about 80-90% of women, the appearance of cellulite in different forms. The pathogenesis of cellulite is a multi factorial event in which the subcutaneous adipose tissue is permeated by altered connective tissue collagen strands. These structures can e.g. when hormone changes more or less swell, making the shape of collagen bands as \"dents\" visible. In the technique of manual subcision, the reticular dermis is surgically separated from the underlying collagen septa. This technique is recommended only for Dellen F\u00f6rmige recoveries, which are present in the rest position of the area. After the exact marking of the individual dents and after prior local anesthesia, the collagenous septa are severed individually by means of sharp micro annulas. With the purely manual subcision, the experience and technique of the surgeon is decisive for the success of the treatment, which is why it is only occasionally used by experienced users. The manual subcision distinguishes the vacuum-assisted subcision, also known as Tissue Stabilized-Guided Subcision (TS-GS). The subcutaneous tissue is stabilized after previous tumescent anesthesia by means of a vacuum hand piece, while a motorassisted microblade separates the fibrous septa in this area. The precise and standardized transection of these septa can be performed in 2 depths at defined fan angles, depending on the location and extent of the dents. The relief effects on the skin show in a prospective clinical study after 3 months, significant improvements in the appearance of cellulite. In the meantime, 3-year results for this prospective clinical trial are available as part of the follow-up. Here, 93% of patients showed satisfaction after only a single treatment. This standardized precision technology provides predictable and reliable effects and addresses the structural causes of cellulite, i. Fights cellulite where it originates. 2. Micro Focused Ultrasound with Visualization (MFU-V) for skin tightening. Micro Focused Ultrasound with Visualization (MFU-V) is an FDA approved non-invasive method for non-invasive lifting and skin tightening of the face, neck and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. In numerous publications its effect could be shown with at the same time small number of unwanted side effects. The device consists of control unit, hand piece and different transducers. With each ultrasound head, the practitioner can visualize the tissue in a depth of up to 8 mm and at the same time deliver the ultrasound energy focused into the tissue. By visualizing the tissue, sensitive structures, such as bones or larger vessels, can be detected and the unwanted injury to these structures during treatment can be avoided. Furthermore, the visualization allows the creation of an individual and tailor-made treatment plan for each patient, as it allows an analysis of the thickness of skin and tissue layers. Since the skin or tissue thickness of patients may be different not only individually, but also intra-individually (e.g., cheeks / submental / neck), and may not necessarily be different from external factors, e.g. BMI or visible and tactile degree of elastosis, can be deduced, the visualization represents the decisive advantage for the treatment. 3.

Combined therapies for rejuvenation of the Periorbital area. Tanta University, Egypt Introduction: Several treatment modalities had been used for the treatment of Vitiligo but the optimal treatment has not yet been identified. Material and Methods: 25 patients with Vitiligo were subjected to Microneedling of two patches of Vitiligo with Dermapen, then application of 5-Fluorouracil to one patch and Tacrolimus on the other patch. This procedure was repeated every 2 weeks for every patient for maximum 6 months (12 sessions). The patients were followed up for 3 months after the last session. Results: The overall repigmentation was significantly higher in 5-Fluorouracil treated patches compared with Tacrolimus. Excellent improvement occurred in 48% of 5-Flurouracil treated patches while only in 16% of Tacrolimus treated patches. In the acral parts, 40% of the patches treated with 5-Flurouracil achieved excellent improvement (repigmentation>75%), while no patch in the acral parts achieved excellent improvement with Tacrolimus . However, there was significant difference between the two drugs, regarding inflammation, ulceration and hyperpigmentation which occurred with 5-Fluorouracil. Discussion: Microneedling combined with 5-Flurouracil or Tacrolimus is safe and effective treatment of Vitiligo. However, 5-Fluorouracil achieved a greater percentage of repigmentation than Tacrolimus particularly in the acral part. 1Khartoum College of Medical Science, Sudan 2Aliaa Medical Centre, Khartoum 3, Sudan 3School of Medicine, Ahfad University for Women, Um Durman, Sudan 4Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Alzaeim Alazhari University, Sudan 5Institute of Endemic Diseases, University of Khartoum, Sudan 6H. Alfarouk Cancer Center, Sudan 7Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Sudan A 66 year old male with a long standing uncontrolled gastric H Pylori infection and Crohns disease presented with nodular lesions in the back. These were removed surgically. Pathologically the lesion consisted of lymphocytes, giant cells with vacuolated cytoplasm and histiocytes. By Immunohistochemistry there were stem cells, B cells and CD1a Langerhans cells. The diagnosis of Langerhans Histiocytosis was made. The giant cells were positive for both CD 20 B cell marker and the macrophage marker CD 68 indicating that they were derived from B cells. They were strongly positive for H Pylori antigen. A year later the patient reported with non-itching nodular lesions in the right flank. There was no Lymphadenopathy or Splenomegaly. A biopsy of the lesion showed a follicular center B cell lymphoma. The tumor cells were positive for H Pylori antigen. He was treated for H Pylori infection. He completely recovered and was in good health a year later.
