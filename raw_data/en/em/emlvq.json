(The 14-day program suits most people) Stage 1: Lead In Over the first four days, you gradually eliminate all meats, processed food, legumes, nuts, and grain products from your diet, while starting a low dose of the herbs. This includes all breads, pasta, beans, cheese and any other refined, packaged, canned or preserved products. You may need to do this for up to a week to adjust fully before proceeding to stage 2. The longer your preparation is, the better your results will be. Up to two weeks can be necessary for some people. Stage 2: Taking the full dose of herbs You will have 24 herbs in combination and take up to 40 capsules daily. Take the herbs twice daily while following the strict diet and recipes provided. Transition into detox mode can sometimes mean passing through a short phase of headaches, nausea, agitation, fatigue, gas or bloating. This should not be uncomfortable and if so, the program should be stopped for a day. If you are comfortable and get through the first three days of transition then you can move into stage 3. Stage 3: Detox This is normally between day 6 and day 14 of my program. You should find that your bowel movements increase in urgency, size, and frequency. Many people experience between 4 and 6 semi-solid bowel movements daily. Around day 10, 11 and 12 is when the real rewards often begin to appear. Impactions (or plaque as it is often referred to) can start to appear. See this plaque picture. You can imagine the benefits of removing this type of build up from your body. The body can then detoxify on many levels, including liver, kidney, and lymphatic system. Stage 4: Follow up It is important to get a good course of probiotics and keep the healthy diet going as long as possible. Immediately returning to a bad diet will not be received well by your body. People often improve long term eating habits after my DETOX. Food for the Ultimate Herbal Detox Since modern food is a major source of our toxin build up, a return to raw, whole and unprocessed food is an important part of the DETOX program. You will get recipes with your program, but here is a list of foods I suggest you can use while completing my herbal DETOX. JUICES Juice combinations could contain the following: apple, beetroot, capsicum (bell pepper), carrot, celery, mango, orange, [papaya](/detox-blog/papaya-carica-papaya-extract-papain), pear, pineapple, tomato, wheatgrass or barley grass. YOGURT SMOOTHIES This is a great way to start your day. Just take your favorite fruit (sorry no bananas as they are too starchy for this cleanse) and fruit juice and add some organic plain yogurt. Throw in some spirulina, barley grass or wheat grass powder for more energy. FRUIT SALADS Try combining different fruit and cover with fruit juice and yoghurt. You can include oranges, lemons, pears, nectarines, plums, peaches, pineapple, kiwifruit, apples, mangoes, cherries, prunes, apricots, [papaya](/detox-blog/papaya-carica-papaya-extract-papain), watermelon, all berries, (no bananas, too starchy). VEGETABLE SALADS These can include lettuce, cabbage, silverbeet, tomato, avocado, spring onion, cauliflower, mushrooms, celery, capsicum (bell pepper) and any green leafy vegetable. Dress with garlic, yoghurt, lemon juice, cold pressed olive oil, apple cider vinegar and herbs. LIGHTLY STEAMED OR STIR-FRIED VEGETABLES Any of the vegetables above can be used, plus pumpkin, parsnip, eggplant (aubergine), zucchini (courgette, marrow), sweet potato, mushrooms, carrot, leek, broccoli, cauliflower. OTHER IDEAS Vegetable soups can contain any of the above vegetables without flour, barley or split peas. Pumpkin or tomato soups are my favorite. Celery sticks with a little hummus, carrot sticks with guacamole (avocado and garlic dip); asparagus, cucumber or beetroot. Prunes, dates, figs, raisins, olives, gherkins or pickled onions are all OK in small amounts.

Circulation encouraged By taking the build-up of toxins out of the body the load is reduced on the heart, kidneys, and liver while pure water, juices, minerals, and vitamins are increased in the foods eaten. The heart is greatly supported as are the blood vessels. This, in turn, benefits the skin, brain, and internal organs with nutrients.
