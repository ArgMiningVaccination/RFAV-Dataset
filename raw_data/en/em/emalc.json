The aim of the study was to evaluate their potential impacts on lymphocyte alterations in patients on hemodialysis (HD). Methods: The plasma levels of PBUTs were assessed in 54 patients on HD and 31 healthy individuals, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The results correlated with the senescent and exhausted status of lymphocytes, based on certain surface molecules, analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: The plasma levels of PBUTs were significantly increased in the patients on HD compared with the healthy controls. The patients with residual kidney function had reduced hippuric acid (HA) levels, total (p = 0.03) and free (p = 0.04), and free IxS levels (p = 0.02). The total and free HA levels correlated negatively with less differentiated subpopulations, CD4+CD45RA+CD31+ (p = 0.037 and p = 0.027), CD8+CD28+CD57 (p = 0.01, p = 0.01), and na\u00efve B cells (CD19+IgD+CD27) (p = 0.04, p = 0.03). Both the total and the free pCS levels correlated positively with exhausted CD4 cells, p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that IxS and age were the main independent parameters implicated in the reduction intotal CD4 and B lymphocytes and their na\u00efve and early differentiated subsets. Conclusions: Increased PBUTs levels are associated with immune disturbances of patients on HD, HA, and IxS in the immunosenescent and pCS "}
