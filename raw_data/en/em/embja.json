It's turned our lives upside-down because even if we haven't been infected by the virus, we've been affected by it. Millions of us on different continents are currently living in quarantine to reduce the spread of the disease. Across the globe, healthcare systems and economies are being pushed to breaking point. And it's all due to something so small that - according to Peter Piot, Director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine -100 million viral particles of the novel coronavirus can fit on a pinhead. It's incredible, isn't it? There's one other thing COVID-19 has done. COVID-19 has reawakened our fear of death. It's something that several of my patients have talked to me about when I've held remote consultations with them over the past few weeks. Death is naturally a part of life. But, before COVID-19 arrived, we weren't confronted by the reality of death every single day. At the moment, you've only got to switch on the TV, browse the internet, or pick up a newspaper to be bombarded by the latest figures telling you how many people COVID-19 has killed. Are today's numbers higher or lower than yesterdays? If they're lower, we still can't relax because what if the numbers go up again tomorrow? Even if the numbers get so small that the Government eases the lockdown, how many more people might die during the anticipated 'second wave'? COVID-19 has made us realise how mortal we are. How vulnerable. How much we've got to lose, and how easily it can all be taken away from us. As if the virus itself wasn't awful enough, COVID-19 has created a fear of death that is ruining the quality of a lot of our lives. But COVID-19 is doing something else, too. It's showing us what is important. It's showing us what happens when we chase the wrong priorities. It's forcing us to recognise that our number one priority should always be our health. Finding balance In Ayurveda, balance is everything. If we eat the right foods, take proper exercise, and get the correct amount of rest, our body will stay in balance, and we'll stay healthy. But, if we get any part of our lifestyle wrong, our body loses balance, and we leave ourselves open to sickness and disease. That's what is happening on a global scale right now. The world has been out of balance for a very long time, and COVID-19 is the result. There's no 'quick fix' way to achieve balance. One of the reasons we're in so much trouble is because we've been relying on quick-fix solutions to solve our problems. But quick fixes don't solve the whole problem, and they always come with a price. Right now, scientists are looking for a quick fix toCOVID-19. Around the world, they're working day and night to find a vaccine. And yet, even when or if they find it, who knows what the price of the vaccine will be? Vaccines can have side-effects. Viruses evolve. Unless we get our priorities right and realise that 'prevention is better than cure' and the only guaranteed way to protect ourselves from illness is to prioritise our health and take responsibility for our wellbeing, we'll always be at risk from sickness and disease. Conventional medicine looks at things backwards. To quote a famous saying, it always \"closes the stable door after the horse has bolted.\" Think about it this way. Conventional medicine works on the basis that you can't find a cure until you already have the dis-ease. But that's far too late because by the time we realise we're sick enough to go to the GP, the disease has already taken root inside our body. It has compromised our immune system; it's entered our bloodstream, our tissues, our organs. Before we've even seen the GP, a disease like COVID-19 has already taken us from healthy to helpless. Yes, the medicine they give us might 'cure' the symptoms, but the damage has already been done. It's made us weaker, and the toxic chemicals that are inside the medications we've been taking have made us weaker too. Who knows what effect that could have on us in the future? We might be feeling better today, but in the weeks, months, and years to come, we'll inevitably get sick again. Ayurveda can eradicate COVID-19 I know that sounds like a huge statement. While doctors and scientists all over the world are scrambling for a COVID-19 cure, I'm about to tell you how you can eradicate COVID-19 right now. But please bear with me and keep reading. I've been an Ayurveda practitioner for over twenty years, and I've personally helped thousands of patients cure their pre-existing illnesses and protect themselves from future sickness. I'm sharing this knowledge with you because I know that it works. I mentioned this earlier but, in my opinion, it can't be repeated often enough: prevention is better than cure. The only correct and sure way of eradicating COVID-19, or any other dis-ease, is by making sure we never get it. Achieving that goal is easy. All you have to do is make your immune system so powerful that your body destroys COVID-19 before it has a chance to take hold. That doesn't mean you should follow the advice I'm about to give you but ignore the global health guidelines. It is vitally important that you still follow the accepted rules and take common-sense precautions to protect yourself and other people. That means if you have any of the COVID-19 symptoms: \u00b7 A recent, continuous dry cough \u00b7 A recent and continuous high temperature \u00b7 Recent shortness of breath \u00b7 Loss or change to your sense of smell and taste You should self-isolate for 7 to 14 days and instantly seek medical attention if the symptoms become more serious. However, please remember that just because you are experiencing specific symptoms, it doesn't automatically mean you haveCOVID-19. The cause might be many things. It could even be anxiety. It's essential to be sensible and practice regular self-care; maintain a 2-metre distance from other people and wash your hands regularly. The virus can remain on some surfaces for up to three days, so make sure you thoroughly clean surfaces that may have become contaminated and stay mindful of everything you touch. Although people from every gender, age group and ethnicity are contracting the virus, studies continue to show that the elderly and vulnerable (i.e. people with pre-existing health conditions) are much more likely to be severely affected by COVID-19. If you are 65 or over, or if you have an underlying health condition, you should self-isolate and take even greater care because you are at a higher risk of infection. How Ayurveda can protect you from COVID-19 COVID-19 is a viral infection which attacks our immune system. Ayurveda teaches that, if your liver is healthy, your immunity is healthy. So, how can you make your liver healthier? Changing your dietary habits can help a lot. It is very easy to eat the wrong foods, and over-indulge ourselves with food and drink, especially when we're under a tremendous amount of stress and pressure. But what you must remember is that those foods are doing you more harm than good, and it's often just as simple (and a lot less expensive) to cook a healthy meal from scratch as it is to put a ready meal inside a microwave. If you want to improve your immunity with Ayurveda, here's what you should do: \u00b7 Avoid all kinds of white flour and white sugar. \u00b7 Avoid all kinds of fried food. \u00b7 Increase the amount of plant-based food protein in your diet \u00b7 Try to avoid eating dairy. If that isn't possible, at least avoid eating dairy in the evening. It will help your digestion absorb the nutrients from your food a lot better \u00b7 Always eat warm and freshly cooked food. \u00b7 Whenever possible, avoid eating too much cold or spicy food. \u00b7 Avoid red meat and seawater fish. \u00b7 Increase the amount of protein you eat and reduce your carbohydrate intake. Foods that are high in protein are tremendously beneficial to your liver. When your liver is performing well, it cleans out the toxins before they can enter your body. \u00b7 Increase your daily intake of Vitamin C. Eating more citrus fruits will help. \u00b7 Ginger and garlic boost your immune system, so try to find ways to incorporate more of those into your diet and cooking. \u00b7 One teaspoon of turmeric powder and half a teaspoon of carom seeds combined in half a cup of water can help to cleanse your blood and remove all toxins. Drink it once a day \u00b7 Cinnamon in your tea will help fight any infection. \u00b7 Keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Adding freshly squeezed lemon juice will help to strengthen your immunity. \u00b7 Try to get at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep a night. I also recommend taking the following Ayurvedic herbal supplements: \u00b7 Turmeric \u00b7 Manjistha \u00b7 Triphala \u00b7 Katuki \u00b7 Ashwagandha Take one capsule two times a day. These supplements are readily available at health food stores and online. The importance of exercise Just like a proper diet, taking adequate exercise is vital if we're going to maintain perfect health. Because COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system, I recommend practising regular yoga breathing exercises to keep your airways clear and improve circulation. Alternate nostril breathing (Anuloma pranayama) is incredibly beneficial. So is Bhastrika pranayama (also known as 'Bellows Breath') which will help to improve your lung capacity, energise your body and clear your mind. If you find either of these practices a struggle when you first begin them, please try to persevere. It won't take long before you start to feel their benefits. Hatha yoga is a fantastic form of exercise that will quickly improve your physical and mental health. It's one of the most popular branches of yoga, with poses and breathing techniques that are perfect for everybody. Walking, running, cross-training, swimming, and any other kinds of cardio exercise will also strengthen your body and respiratory system. Remember; Ayurveda doesn't treat the symptoms. It eradicates the root cause of the sickness before it has the chance to infect your body. That's how Ayurveda will protect you from COVID-19. Let's all follow this amazing science and create a positive change in ourselves as well as the world around us. Until the next time we meet - stay healthy, stay happy, stay safe. Dr Rohan Nagar "}
