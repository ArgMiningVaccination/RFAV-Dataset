{"title": "A Unique Physical Therapy Approach in a Complex Case of Pott's Fracture: A Case Report", "author": "Anushka Raipure; Pratik Phansopkar; Shivani R Uttamchandani", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The ankle joint is a complex joint that bears the human body's weight throughout daily activities. Unimalleolar, bimalleolar, and trimalleolar fractures are the three subgroups that make up the category of ankle fractures. Determining the risk-benefit tradeoffs between non-operative and surgical therapy still requires a thorough initial examination of the fracture pattern, soft tissue condition, and patient characteristics. Ankle fractures that are stable and well-aligned respond well to conservative therapy. Open reduction and internal fixation is the current gold standard of treatment for displaced and unstable fracture patterns, with historical data revealing good to outstanding outcomes for the majority of these patients. We present a case of a 19-year-old female sustaining a Pott's fracture following a road traffic accident. The overall treatment technique used included the overload principle, task-specific training, and an impairment-based strategy. The patient's impairments with regard to the range of motion, strength, edema, discomfort, wound healing, and functional limitations were handled by the therapist using exercises, manual therapy, and compressive cryotherapy. A clinically significant rehabilitation protocol for treating Pott's fracture is established in this case report.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-03-29", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
