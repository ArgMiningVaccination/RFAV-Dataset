Homoeopathy is the key for those individuals who get affected as there are many medicines in our system which can help the individuals with ill effects of vaccination Homoeopathically. We know how Covid-19 pandemic has devastated the human life & still continuing its run worldwide. As a solution to this there have been discovery of Vaccines to get rid the Corona Virus but none of the vaccines are hundred precent affective, but will reduce the adverse effects of corona virus when affected.2 All the Scientists around the world started researching and also developing vaccines In India, two vaccines were approved for emergency use namely Covishield and Covaxin. Then, in April 2021, a third vaccine was approved for use, Sputnik V. Above all, we also should accept the fact that, taking the Covid-19 vaccine can lead to a few mild side effects such as pain at the site of injection, mild fever, etc. Let us now take a closer look at these side effects and how to deal with them Homoeopathically.2 Hahnemann & concept of immunization: When we look back at the history, it is a fact that Jenner's first experiments with Cowpox in Dorset in the summer of 1796, actually was coincided with Hahnemann's publication of his 'Essay on a New Principle for ascertaining the curative powers of medicine'. As an unprejudiced observer as well as physician, Hahnemann was completely aware of developments in the field of medicine during his times. He was not only well versed with the Jenner's concept of immunization but also very keen about concept of immunization. In fact, Hahnemann perceived that it was on account of similarity of manifestation and differing in kind nature of cowpox vaccination (cowpox and small pox are two different disease entities with differing infecting agent), and it was very evident thus this paved way for success of cowpox inoculation. He thus appreciated Jenner's Cow-pox vaccination as mentioned in the Footnote to \u00a746 of sixth edition Organon of Medicine as: 'This seems to be the reason & fact namely that since the general distribution of Jenner's Cow-pox vaccination, human small-pox never again appeared as epidemically or virulently as 40-45 years before when one city visited lost at least one-half and often three-quarters of its children to death. This basically shows how open-minded Hahnemann was & also his rationalistic approach in medicine that allowed him to appreciate the works of his contemporaries.3 Mild Side Effects of Approved COVID-19 Vaccines in India 1 Covishield - Injection site pain - Headache - Fever - Fatigue - Muscle or joint pain - Chills - Nausea Covaxin - Injection site pain and swelling - Rashes - Fatigue - Body ache - Fever - Vomiting - Cough - Cold - Abdominal pain - Nausea - Headache Sputnik V - Sore arm - Low fever - Tiredness - Headaches Symptoms in detail with respect to Homoeopathic remedies:2 Site of injection: Pain at the site of Injection you might experience some pain or swelling on the arm where you got the shot, unable to lift the hand properly, mild restricted movements Indicated Homoeopathic Remedies are: Arnica Montana, Bellis Perennis, Belladonna is a botanical that relieves muscle pain.5 Fatigue - after getting the vaccine, you might feel unusually tired with laziness & decreased interest in doing work & a kind of drowsiness.
