The first step is to simply settle in and observe the fluctuations of your mind. You'll learn about the three Ayurvedic energies (doshas), practice feeling them, and use your awareness to begin directing them in ways that serve you. Props Suggested: A blanket, bolster or chair. Meditation Stress is an inevitable part of life, but you can build resilience by managing your energy and creating mental space. This meditation will balance all three of your doshas by using your attention to play with the idea of space. Settle in and connect with the feelings of expansiveness and gravity, experiencing what it's like to be both anchored and free. Props Suggested: A blanket, bolster or chair. Meditation The vata dosha is characterized by air, movement, expansiveness and creativity, although too much of this energy can leave you feeling restless and scattered. Today you'll learn to calm your mind by focusing your attention on grounding energy. Bring your awareness to the structure and weight of your body, feeling strong, stable and steady. Props Suggested: A blanket, bolster or chair. Week 2 Meditation The pitta dosha is the energy of fire, transformation, digestion and drive. Allow your fire to be one of strength, insight and clarity by turning your attention to the present moment. Feel compassion any time your mind starts to wander, and simply anchor yourself again with your focus. Props Suggested: A blanket, bolster or chair. Meditation When you feel blocked, in despair, or you just can't get going, use the qualities of fire to light your inner match of joy! Kapha is the energy of water, earth, nourishment and stability, but when out of balance it can leave you feeling lethargic and stuck. Today, you'll spark your internal flame and inspire passionate action by focusing on feelings of internal warmth. Props Suggested: A blanket, bolster or chair. Meditation Meditation is like a breath mint for the mind; it helps you digest the constant mental stimulation. Create space to process your thoughts and experiences by taking a moment to pause and connect. Though your thoughts may sway, it's all part of the process of integrating, expanding and finding balance. Props Suggested: A blanket, bolster or chair. Practice wherever you want, whenever you need.
