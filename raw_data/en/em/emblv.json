Chiropractor acupuncture MN deals with hip pain, [back pain](https://theglenchiro.com/causes-of-post-surgical-back-pain/), neck pain due to spinal misalignment, pinched nerves, and ligament damage due to trauma. The natural treatments that are offered are based on traditional Chinese medicine, one of the oldest forms of medicine in the world. It is meant to relieve pain and promote relaxation. The practice has evolved over 3,000 years of history starting with shamans who learned how to manage pain by using plants and herbs. This evolved into acupuncture, the practice of inserting needles into specific points on the body that are associated with different meridians or energy pathways. In this treatment, fine needles are placed in your skin at the related muscles, tendons, and ligaments. These areas have been determined to be linked with the affected area of your body. Once the needles are inserted, they are moved very gently to stimulate or alleviate pain. The therapist may also breathe or twist the needles more intensively for a deeper feeling of relief. Most people feel nothing at all while having acupuncture done on them, but some patients have described it as being similar to the feeling of an electrical shock. It might tingle or sting slightly, but it shouldn't be painful. It should last about 40 minutes to one hour depending on the number of needles that are inserted into your body.

Some people don't believe acupuncture works; but nobody knows how it does work, which is why belief in its effectiveness varies so much. Research shows that there are biochemical changes in the body when needles are inserted at certain points on the body or into specific areas of the body.

According to traditional Chinese medicine, standard acupuncture treatment is just a way of redirecting or balancing your chi, along these pathways that run through your body. However, many modern acupuncturists have come to see it as a more \"spiritual\" practice that has little to do with the normal view of Chinese medicine.
