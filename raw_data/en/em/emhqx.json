Does energy healing have its origins in non-Christian religions?", "sitename": "GotQuestions.org", "date": "2004-11-01", "cleaned_text": "Answer In a world where people are constantly grasping for deeper meaning, deeper spirituality, and a higher purpose, energy healing is one more New Age philosophy that presents itself as very desirable to human beings. Born with sin, we all come into the world with the strong belief that we are the center of the universe\u2014that we are in control of our health, our bodies, our lives, our circumstances, and our destinies. Those who have not turned to God for Truth have no choice but to search for it within themselves. The practice of energy healing is not in itself a religion, but it is a pathway to one's own spirituality. It leads us on a personal journey that encourages us to focus on ourselves and how our energy is in sync with the energies of the cosmos, the earth, and all other life. Through this, we can supposedly be taught to heal ourselves by using clairvoyance to \"visualize\" where the negative energy is in order to determine the cause of the problem, whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual. Reiki, a widely used energy healing technique, was said to have been developed by a Buddhist monk who used cosmic symbols for healing. Reiki claims to work by removing obstructions to the flow of life force energy throughout the body. These obstructions are allegedly caused by negative thoughts, actions, or feelings, which some believe are the fundamental cause of illness. Many even claim that employing this method is the way Jesus obtained His healing power, rather than attributing His power to the fact that He is God. The use of energy healing encourages us to put our full trust in ourselves and our own bodies, which is a form of worship. For most who participate in energy healing, no recognition is given to the one true God, nor does He receive any praise for healing. The person using these methods of healing has made himself into his own god. Getting involved in energy healing is spiritually dangerous, to say the least. The Bible tells us that Jesus is the One who came to heal. \"Then Jesus said, 'Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest'\" (Matthew 11:28). God does not want or expect us to help ourselves. He is the source of life, of all that is good and true. Those who refuse to acknowledge Jesus will never come to a place of spiritual healing. \"For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal "}
