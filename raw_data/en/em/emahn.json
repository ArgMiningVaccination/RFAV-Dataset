This situation also implicitly reflects on the Earth's \"health\". In order to avoid such dangerous and already manifested situations of \"human ecology\" crisis, a complex of novel strategies should be taking into consideration, starting with an integrative knowledge how to preserve the \"connection energy\". The application of some biophotonic inventions concerning a new ecologic and sanogenous (health-generating) medium of life is discussed below.. We have to recognize that the modern world confronts human beings with an increased range of supraliminal stress factors: - subjective factors, targeting the emotional stress that humans suffer in relation to various issues / problems - more complex and difficult (natural or artificial) - of his existence; - objective factors, represented by the harmful effects produced by environmental sources with which man interacts, beginning from increasingly contaminated food with unhealthy additives, to the radiating fields of modern technology (electromagnetism, radioactivity, etc.), and the stressful factors of the bio-field generated at the level of human groups. The conclusion seems as incredible as it is true: human health implicitly affects the health of the living environment and - in extremis - the Earth's \"metabolism\", and vice versa. Such observations indicate that the changes of the living environment - through the changed nature of the related bio-electromagnetic fields - affect not only human health, but also the possibility of homeopathic recovery of health, and especially in cases of mental disorders. In general, most of these disorders are due to the human failure to correctly adapt to bio-physical and mental stimuli with which they constantly face, which produces a huge loss of energy. In order to prevent such a situation, we suggested - in various other contexts [Stanciulescu, Poenaru, 2008] - a biophotonic strategy (biology + theory / technology of lasers) for getting out of any crisis, implicitly one of health, by promoting a prophylactic type of thinking. 1. CONSERVING THE CONNECTION ENERGY\": A VERY SIMPLE BUT NEGLECTED KNOW HOW\" - Through \"Connection Energy\" (or \"Adaptation Energy \") we understand that energy is spent by humans in order to adapt themselves to the existence and functioning of natural or artificial (technological) systems, processes, phenomena, and objects with which they have continual contact within their living environment. 1. In general, human beings spends more connection energy, bio-physical or psychological, than is necessary to adapt to the environment (objects, phenomena, processes), for one reason or another, such as: lack of knowledge about the object, phenomenon, process (in example, through an inadequate know-how, poor quality of the product / environment not properly adapted to human needs, unfavorable conditions of use / adaptation of the product, unjustified motivation / stress while using a particular object, etc.) This situation of energy waste leads man to a health crisis, including illness (in the first phase, physical illness). 2. The knowledge and control of the energy-information relationship of man with the processes, phenomena and objects of his living environment, by cancelling or reducing the above mentioned issues, would allow the individual to preserve a significant amount of energy, which might be used in any another context. We formulated several strategic principles, in various other public contexts, sustaining the possibility of overcoming such crisis situations of bio-psychological health by: - Recovery of a well known principle, but only less applied, that prophylaxis should be a priority over therapy; in this regard, exogenous homeopathy develops such a prophylactic component, by promoting Biophotonic Resonators for the stimulation of the immune system, and protection against the electromagnetic smog, etc. [1]: - understanding that it is not enough to solve a specific problem that manifests itself here and now, but it is also necessary to formulate a broader strategy, a know-how capable of controlling the entire range of related issues. As the old Chinese proverb says, in order to feed a hungry man it is not enough to give him a fish today, another tomorrow, etc., but instead you should teach him how to fish. In other words, it is not enough to therapeutically solve a headache today, and a fatigue state tomorrow, but instead you have to modify the environment in which we live - for example - so that it no longer affects the ailing bio-physical state; - the capture and processing of BPL (bio-psycho-logical) consumption achieved by man, in strategic resources during crisis situations, for health, the amplification of the immune system resources through the Exogenous Homeopathy (ExHo) [Stanciulescu, 2011] [2] effects of the environment or through the training of muscle or nervous system, for situations of supraliminal effort are established in such prophylactic measures; - reconsideration of our solutions regarding the use of conventional energies which ignore the often harmful effects caused by these energies to human health, starting from smoke that affects the eyes and the perturbing smell which troubles the breathing, up to the electric or electromagnetic field that affects the bio-psychic equilibrium - by finding non-polluting ecological alternatives; in this sense, the conjunction between Biophotonics and Synergetics, will create ExHo effects, such as the biological / biophotonic sources of caloric energy, power generators based on the cavitation effect, coupled with the \"biophotonics resonators\", etc.; - surpassing the consequences of \"Valencia Phenomenon \" called in this way after some meanings acquired at the exhibition \"HABITAT Valencia 2008 \", on which occasion, I found that no manufacturer actually had ever thought of the effect of a wonderful crystal chandelier over the human eye and over the psychical state / mood of the beneficiary, the manner in which a cushion or a seat can influence / affect through pressure or heat the bio-physiological status of users', etc., I realized that in the sense of an optimal preservation of connection energy, any thing or complex of things with which human beings are to be exposed directly or indirectly simply through its existence, is in the sphere of his energy-informational influence. - Through generalization we say that the design of the optimal mental strategy for an ecologically-pure existence in the living environment requires the reconsideration of the energy consumption effects that were put in evidence by the above strategies, and replacing them with effective ways to think about our presence in the world. In conclusion, we say that the energy conservation represents a vital source to resolve the human resources crisis, from the bio-psychological ones, up to the cultural, economical ones, etc., as human energy is the only one that can profitably replace any other resource. The removal of stressful environmental aspects of our lives, by replacing them with material and mental systems capable of harmoniously resonating with the human body - represents a therapeutic strategy. However, in this respect, the principles of Exogenous Homeopathy in the reconfiguration of our living environment, represents a direction that modern man should be aware of, as he implicitly was once. * To such a general conclusion, Exogenous Homeopathy can make a vital contribution, by generating - based on the principles set out above on the achievement of the biophotonic resonators - an ecological and balanced living environment through the nature of environmental stimuli. In carrying out this intention I had as a model, the way of living of the traditional Romanian village, characterized by the fact that through an intuitive knowledge of human harmony with nature, the simple man of past times has known them and used them harmonically: - the natural / biological / organic materials such as wood, earth, stone in order to build the house and sculpt tools; vegetal fabrics to make clothing, homeopathic ornaments to decorate the house, etc. - the most harmonious colours as possible with natural dyes; - the sacred geometry archetypal designs for everything that could be decoratively embellished; - volumes built after the golden ratio; - auxiliary ambience having a homeopathic function (ingredients, vegetable protein), etc. The fact that another series of these practices set up bridges between the modern day human and the past tradition, makes easier the task of inserting the ExHo principles in the modern mind / mentality, already prepared to rationally understand the principles of an objective connection, namely: - Ecological-sanogenous traditions of Romanian folk creation: from the commercial utilities (painted pots and carved spoons), up to the Easter eggs, dyed naturally and ritually decorated with cosmogonic design: Figure 1. Very old cosmogonic symbols, having - by their \"waves of form\" - an implicit harmonizing effect on human health Figure 2. \"At the beginning there was the sign ...\": traditional Romanian creations, having a double function: to conserve the main symbolical knowledge about the cosmic and human world, and to generate a healthy frame of life, by the constant presence of complex harmonious stimuli, such as materials, colours and shapes, volumes and accessories etc. All these original traditions were kept and stored in the bud until today, being often coupled in a synergistic manner that unites materials and volumes, colors and shapes / forms, movement and sounds, etc., in synergistic rituals such as those of the New Year. - The human group acts as a complex \"BioPhotonic resonator\". The traditions preserved as \"performance on stage\" of the winter holidays - still marked by traditional costumes manufactured from natural, vegetable and protein materials, decorated with cosmogonic archetypes, the chant / \"the wishing\" in the holy days, the twisting ritual dance in \"therapeutic circle\", and \" homeopathic auxiliaries\": Figure 3. The \"New Year wishing bouquet\" made of natural flowers and tree branches [http://www.romania-insider.com]) having stimulating function - provided once a harmonic and pure resonance space to human communities. And they still can do it today, both in public and private spaces. All these environmental aspects followed the principles of \"holographic resonance, the cosmic law of surviving (belagines) and the synergistic principles of exogenous homeopathy, to set up an ecologic and sanogenous living environment, balanced from the bio-psychical point of view. If we look back we understand that all these creative practices and sacred rituals that accompanied them had a double function: - a cognitive function, which is to preserve the memory of the world creation, the whole living environment as a special \"training book\" of the natural cosmic harmony laws - a therapeutic function, stimulating the generation of energies and information being in harmonic resonance with the body and human \"soul \". Through these two categories of effects, manifested both in material and the spiritual plan, the traditional habitat was a protective universe, without major stress, able to optimally preserve the adaptation energy of humans. By radiating energies and information being in harmonic resonance with the human body and psyche, the traditional habitat was able to optimally preserve the energy of human adaptation. By following the general rules of exogenous homeopathy, retrieving the valuable suggestions of the tradition, keeping some achievements of the current technology was possible and necessary to reconstruct a similar / analogous / pure living environment from which the stress and the harmful physical factors to be removed. A HOMEOPATHY OF LOVE, namely... Semiotically assumed but its COMUNION OF SIGNS ... Figure 4. A Romanian SEMIOTICS OF LOVE. INITIATION INTO THE COMMUNION SCIENCE [Stanciulescu, 2007, cover by Aritia Poenaru] (in translation). An explosion of light... 2. TOWARDS A BIOPHOTONIC ECO-SANE HABITAT: STRATEGIES FOR A HOLISTIC THERAPY The conclusion previously formulated is of extreme importance because it involves the effective use of a combination of therapeutic solutions, in which exogenous homeopathy is implicitly involved. The applied research conducted at the National Institute of Inventions from Lasi, have eloquently demonstrated, in the last decade, how the biophotonic products can generate optimizing homeopathic effects. We realized that - in accordance with the principle of the holistic distal therapy [Stanciulescu, 2010] - everything that comes in the air and somehow changes the state of the receiving system - actually generates informational effects of a homeopathic type. Through generalization, one can say that under the holographic resonance mechanism already described above, all systems / objects in the environment - beginning with the house architecture and the furniture structure, up to clothing and related accessories (here are included also the biophotonics resonators) - permanently transmit to the human body infinitesimal stimuli that the body receives and processes, with more or less sensitive optimizing effects. To do this, for information only - to support all the theoretical premises developed so far - we suggest a range of possibilities of the latest technology able to optimize the mental and physical health of human beings. To have an intuition of the holistic sanogenous effects, that exogenous homeopathy strategies can generate, it is enough to briefly introduce further - in the category of these products - some of the practical applications, already working and presented at the recent Show Room. Each of these applications represent: - the result of a patent, being already manufactured as model or as working prototype; - a suggestive experiment to highlight the effect of exogenous homeopathy to human receptor, using measurements made with different bio-resonance equipment. We will take into account the following contributions, with a reference to contributing to the conservation of the connection energy, to the generation of an ecological and sanogenous environment and thus regulating various dysfunctions - of psycho-mental type - - ECOLOGICAL AND SANOGENIC Poenaru) with stimulative bio-synergistic effects on the human body, starting from construction materials, biophotonically treated (mortars with structured water, for example), to the biophotonic plasters and the stimulating colors appropriate to the beneficiaries' psychical status, up to \"wave forms\" of the architectural volumes. Here we add the types of decoration, the biophotonic resonators for the interior protection against the Hartmann radiation or for the protection against the harmful EM waves etc. All these things were implicitly known to the old builders / constructors, who used the cosmogonic symbolism - part of religious rituals and objects, including object of architecture (church and house) and the overall structure / layout of the village. Figure 5. Among all types of environmental structures, architecture is the more complex one and can include all types of stimulating effects of exogenous homeopathy. Figure 6. \"ICHTUS\", Sa(ca(r\u00c3\u00a2mb (Romania): International Complex for Human Therapy and Unity of Spirit [Poenaru, 2010] (1) The Spiritual Centre: a) the Road of Light, an initiatic layout describing the cosmogenesis' archetypes (starting from the genesis of the original waters to informational creation of the cosmic world), as a process of \u00e2\u20accosmic homeopathy\"; b) the Temple of Archetypal Initiation, a very complex Biophotonic Resonator, based on the use of different types of \"living light\" for opening the human mind; (2) The Complementary Therapy Centre is conceived as a synergetic structural-functional architecture, using the simple but powerful volumes, such as: a) sphere and horizontal lines, in the administrative and research building; b) the rectangular volumes, in the hospital for complementary therapies investigations and treatments building . The complex - entirely conceived under the Principles of BIOPHOTONIC ARCHITECTURE and located in an area of high telluric energy (due to the gold of high purity in the ground) and cosmic force (the place belongs to the sacred zone of ancient Dacia) - values the synergy of the space and of the symbolism / cosmogonic mandalas, energetic protectors (\"flower of life\" for example), the \"sacred geometry\" and colour-therapy, etc.., for building a centre for spiritual harmonization and one for complementary therapies (with a biophotonic and synergistic research department and homeopathy), a resting centre with psycho-therapeutic sightseeing etc. An exceptional synergy of body therapy with that of the soul and the spirit [3], a \"biophotonic resonator \" whose purpose - as ancestors knew - is to contribute to the healing of the soul (mental disturbances) so that the body is able to follow. According to these aspects, connecting synergetically the structural and functional parameters of a certain building, it is necessary to mention that our \"architecture of light\" team is already prepared to project and practically realize any type of biophotonic building, starting from the objective BPL features of the beneficiaries that could be simply optimized. For the first time can talk about the synthesis between things and architectural / constructive practices known for ages and their exploitation, knowingly, from the perspective of the latest technology of biophotonics and the principles of Exogenous Homeopathy. * * * To the potential beneficiaries, who are already expected, not only symbolically [4], we reveal in the following, a series of other technological construction performances - such as the autonomy of electricity and heat supply from unconventional sources, which in turn have exogenous therapeutic effects - in which the ExHo and BioPhotonics are implicitly correlated. - STRUCTURES-ENERGY GENERATORS, for the autonomous supply of the architectural complex, namely: - Power Generation System from the terrestrial electromagnetic field [Stanciulescu, Bursuc, Poenaru, 2010], characterized in that: - it generates an electrical current, through a Faraday cage effect, caused by the electromagnetic waves network, which penetrated the inside of the pyramid; - the pyramidal system is at the same time, a powerful generator of stimulating \"form waves\", being equipped with devices with biologically active substances, able to absorb / neutralize the harmful radiation. The pyramid is designed as a huge BioPhotonic Resonator having exogenous / homeopathic effects spread on a wide area of influence (proportional to the size of the pyramid). - The functional model of the pyramid, generator of electrical power (presented by its authors: Traian D. Stanciulescu, Constantin P. Bursuc, Aritia D. Poenaru): a) the energetic effect of the pyramid highlighted by the LED operation / consumer at the top of the pyramid, with a voltage of 2,2 V; in the superior zone of the pyramid are fitted the Biophotonic Resonators for homeopathic protection (through demodulation and absorption) against the telluric and electromagnetic radiation RTF, b) the informational effect of the pyramid, likely to be magnified on a large impact grill: electrographic print of the \"form waves\" generated by a pyramidal model, made of cardboard (acc. to Guja, 2008). Figure 7. \"Let the light be...\": a synergy of authors' creative minds (International Exhibit for Inventions, Iasi, 2010). The homeopathic effects of the pyramid, stimulative on the one hand, inhibitive on the other hand, will be felt first in the neuro-psychiatric states, knowing the powerful effect of EM radiation from the phone or within an antenna field, for example. On the other hand, the informational stimulative effects of the pyramid have been known for a long time (being patented by Drbal, since 1959). - HEAT GENERATING SOURCE WITH LOW POWER CONSUMPTION [Stanciulescu, Gasca, Poenaru, 2006 / No. 2010], characterized by: - generation of a high temperature with low power consumption due to high thermo-electric yield of the organic nano-powders which comprise the active substance placed on a sheet of fiberglass, and due to the possible absorption of infrared energy from the environment (due to the organic qualites of the system); - the organic gel which is comprised of the active substance has some exceptional homeopathic properties, transforming the thermal plate assembly in a different type of BR, infrared emitter, with a healthy source of heat; - the beneficial effects of the \"living heat\" become a biophotonic amplifier which favors the development of human \"biolasers\", processes and installation of other homeopathic endogenous or exogenous effects, with priority at the neuropsychological level. The bio-resonating structure of the thermal plate, additionally treated with silicon crystals, can reach temperatures of 80 degrees with a minimum consumption of electricity... essentially, the therapeutic effects - exo-homeopathic ones - that are generated by this bio-photonic amplification strategy. Figure 8. The biophotonic thermic source, with biological substance active generating a \"homeopathic heat\" Many measurements performed with the METATRON equipment revealed that particular psycho-fatigue states of the tested subject's brain (dark squares represent dysfunctional neurological areas) spectacularly optimized itself by simply heating the palms for a few minutes over the thermal plate, which generated \"living heat\". Ascultat,iCitit,i foneticThe use of the bio-thermal plates to create a properly heated climate: - in addition to the sanogenous properties of the physical type, do not dry the nasal and respiratory mucous, are not aggressive, and the plates are heated gradually; - has as physical effect the achieving of a living environment able to contribute to a strong conservation of the connection energy. Figure 9. The influence of a biophotonic source of heating on human health: the case of a subject / male exhausted after a long travel and changing of medium, with a very poor energetic situation of the brain; after a few minutes of heating his hands, the situation change radically, becoming a normalized one (by the engineer Mihai Costache). - INDIVIDUALIZED BIOPHOTONIC CLOTHING ARTICLES homeopathic effects is generated by the same synergy of those five stimuli categories already mentioned: the material, the color and the form of the decorative design, tailoring and accessories used. Considering that the synergy of these biophotonic parameters and their combination is a highly complex polychrest remedy, we appreciate that - after the living place / house, or perhaps even before it, being in a closer relationship with the body and its fields - the clothing represents the most powerful exo-homeopathic remedy. Its effects are both informational at field level, and energetical, by piezoelectric pressure effect. For example, the two dresses exhibited at the Show Room of Inventions Lasi in 2010 - awarded with the gold medal - were designed to generate sanogene effects of exogenous homeopathy, particularly with neuro-psychiatric optimizing effects, generated by the biologically active materials used, by the strategies and accessories respectively. Figure 10. Two of the healthy dress-pieces belonging to the RAINBOW collection of Aritia Poenaru [2008] - The Red Dress. The combination is constituted by a dress and a voal scarf, red taffeta busteer and the bodice is from red cotton, industrially painted, with an exceptional compatibility / resonance in the case of an organism having a low blood pressure. The green taffeta ponders the dominance of red. Polarized light has been applied over a levogyre pattern spiral with a calming effect for about an hour. Homeopathically, the complex stimulates the increase of hemoglobin and blood circulation, influencing vitality and sexual tonicity, and finally stimulates cerebral activity. - The Flowered Black Suit. It has some remarkable effects, invigorating over all organs, by recording the highest values of all up-to-date measurements. It conserves the energy. The blouse and the trouser are made of 100% wool treated with cyclodextrin and stimulated with rose essence. The black suite preserves the energy of the neural system, balances the thyroid, super-renal glands, the intestine, activates the visual focus, reproductive glands activity, the kidneys, the immunity system, the lower back area and overall, the whole organism is protected from energetic loss. The biophotonic treatments that were applied: polarized light with a double harmonizing spiral for an hour, sacred music. The red knot on the chest has a biophotonic cerebral protection: to absorb the ocular retroversion / biophotonic super-radiance generated by the \"evil-eye\" persons. Each of the two dresses is equipped with a Biophotonic Resonator \"pendant\" type which is worn around the neck and also generates strong stimulating effects at the level of the circulatory and endocrine system, in the case of hypotension, respectively, focalization and energy conservation, immune system stimulation in the case of the protection clothing. Figure 11. The general schema of the patent, presenting a synergetic number or therapeutic strategies - of exogenous homeopathy - connected to a certain clothing complex. The concise description involves the connection of many therapeutic strategies - traditional or new technological ones - for generating therapeutic effects, by specific combinations according to the situation of the patient. We will enumerate only a few of these procedures, from all those recorded in the patent - including: strategies for protection against the technical electromagnetic radiation or biological, kymatics (Manners), luxonica (Stanciulescu), phytotherapy, crystal therapy, laser-therapy and therapy polarized light (Zepter), auricular, palm and body acupressure, reflexology and acupuncture (Su Jok), chromatic therapy, floral scent and oils (Bach), sacred geometry therapy and therapy through forms (2D and 3D), therapy with fractals and yayantra (Jasmine), 4D Medicine (Weinreb), New Homeopathy (Koerbler), quantum healing and others. In a predominantly energetic / informational form all these therapies interfere, with the effect of releasing the latent energy and information traps of the body. All involve, in one form or another, exogenous homeopathy mechanisms initiated from outside the body, with the purpose of supporting the self healing process. In this way, the clothing synergistic therapy is an effective example of integration. We mention that, from all therapeutic procedures involved, a big part of them - particularly those of the preponderantly informational type - will be addressed to the brain's equilibrium / balance, through a strong harmonizing action of the psycho-emotional and mental states. Mentioning all these categories of therapies, we practically see that they are basically already known. But just now, by highlighting the individual biophotonic mechanisms which characterize them, the exploitation of their functional synergy became possible. In a holistic vision of complementary medicine, having as \"hard core\" exogenous homeopathy, was possible the manufacturing and the patenting of the biophotonic resonator for the energy-informational stimulation of biological systems, which we have already presented most extensively so far. 3. THE BIOPHOTONIC NANOTECHNOLOGY, A PREMISE OF THE ACTUAL WELL-BEING REVOLUTION Apparently, all the applications mentioned above belong to the macro-technologic systems: the architecture and furnishings, clothing, the generating sources of power and the caloric sources etc. In reality, through the bio-physical properties that characterize them, all these systems manifest also at the micro-structural level too, being generators of nano-technological effects, as we have already shown, the powders of the active substance specific to any BR act. Although, in one form or another, the BRs are coupled with the resonating macro-systems mentioned above, it means that implicitly the ExHo effects will be manifested in the interaction between humans with the references of his living environment. That's why, from a holistic perspective we can say that the Biophotonic Resonator designed for energy-informational stimulation of the biological system is the invention with the greatest application and impact for homeopathic use, being made up as an accessory which can added - as a decorative item - for each of the systems mentioned above: the object of architecture and furniture, clothes and decorative objects, appliances, energy sources, etc.. In other words, the BR is truly a \"classical\" representative of exogenous homeopathy, respecting all its principles, involving nanotechnology and the ultra-weak emission of biophotons of the biologically active substance, color-therapy and therapy with mandalas, the volumetric shape / form and decorative accessories etc. Therefore, the use of exogenous homeopathy through different types of BR is an old practice since ages, but modern technology has allowed a more nuanced exploitation of them. Its development and use was conceived from the beginning as a practical application of exogenous homeopathy. Its practical uses are numerous, among which we mention now only those presented at the Show Room of Inventions from Lasi, November 2010, as potential applications. Figure 12. Diverse applications of the Biophotonic Resonators in various forms, such as: a) stimulation of human health in situations of hypo-or hyper-functional imbalance, or general stimulation of the immune system by simply wearing a decorative pendant or by its association with some clothing complex; b) coupling BRs of different forms with a utility object such as a wallet made of natural materials such as leather, worn around the body for general or specific stimulation necessary to the human subject; c) use of BR as a terrestrial radiation protection system, coupled with a leather agenda, located in the place to be protected; d) use of a BR complex for immune system stimulation and protection against EM radiation generated by handheld device, PC,V; e) biophotonic stimulation / structuring of drinking water (with superior physical and chemical properties) by means of a BR complex combined with chromatic therapy and crystal therapy effects, and of other types of drinks and foods, dietary supplements or even drugs, etc.; f) use of BRs as radiation dispersers, placing them on energetic structures such as the pyramid as power generator or bio-thermal sources, etc. As a functional synthesis of all these possible uses of BRs, should be mentioned the most recent brief proposal, presented both at the XVth International Exhibition of Research, Innovation and Technological Transfer, and in the frame of the European Conference \"Cradle to Cradle\" Net , organized at Lasi, Romania (June 8-10, 2011). The invention, entitled: Biophotonic Applications of Exogenous Homeopathy for Protection Traian D. Stanciulescu, Aritia D. Poenaru, 2011] received the Honor Diploma and the Gold Medal \"HENRI COANDA\". Figure 13. The Diploma and Gold Medal awarded at INVENTICA 2011, Iasi, Romania The invention is valorising - in a complex synergy of effects - the mechanisms and actions of the Exogenous Homeopathy (and implicitly of the Endogenous Homeopathy), and is presented in this recent book.. Figure 14. An emergent book on EXOGENOUS HOMEOPATHY [Stanciulescu, 2011] - The theoretical principles and the explanatory mechanisms of the invention are based on: - the novel effect of Exogenous Homeopathy (Stanciulescu, 2011) the external stimulation of the immune system, through the Biophotonic effects / holographic resonance of some specifically selected vegetal and protein (nano) substances, Synergetically amplified by the beneficial conjunction of colors, forms and volumes used; - the utilization of an assembly of certain Biotechnological Systems able to reflect and / or to absorb the radioactive emissions / particles, systems such as: - pieces of clothing provided with a thin plumb net and treated with cyclodextrine which has been impregnated with natural anti-radioactive (nano) powders, biophotonically energized, etc.; - different types of \"biophotonic resonators\" with different forms and utilizations, such as decorative objects or neck pendants, containing inside a polychrest complex of exo- and/ or endo-homeopathic remedies, able to inhibit the harmful irradiation effects at the level of the human body. - The invention - having as a main purpose the protection against radioactivity (generated artificially, by ecological disasters such as the recent one from Fukushima, 2011) - could be connected with different technological solutions applied in human health for prophylaxis and therapeutics, ecology and architecture, in furniture and healthy clothing, utility objects and decorative accessories etc. Figure 15. Different types of protective / reflective pieces of clothing (for a man, in this case), such as jersey or vest, middle bell, neck or articulation bands, providing: natural / biological type of textile materials (vegetable or organic, such as cotton or silk), treated with cyclodextrine and inserted with biological powders from plants or animals (wolf's claw, pollen, etc.) for generating a continuum reflexive surface, provided with a plumb wire Faraday net type, textile material being stimulated by polarized or laser light through a invisible pattern such as a dextrogyrate (stimulating) spiral, coloured filters with reflexive drawing etc. Figure 16. Different forms of BRs for protection against technological and natural radiation, from extra-plate plastified ones to specific box-capsules design (proposed by D. Grebenisan, 2010). The original solution used for realizing these protective against radioactivity types or BRs, supposes to activate a synergic ExHo-EnHo (exo-endogenous homeopathy) effect, by coupling two types of homeopathic remedies, namely: (1) an adequate mixture of biological substances powder (a new BR5 - type, for example, already described in [Stanciulescu, 2011b] and: (2) a polychrest type of few traditional homeopathic remedies (dilutions), able to stimulate the fight against the harmful effects of radiations, including specific coloured filters and specific forms / volumes, warren at neck or front, accorded to a certain type of ExHo clothing complex, protecting the most affected organs (thyroid, hypothalamus, etc.) against irradiation, by essentially increasing the human immunity system. Figure 17. An absorbent type of protective radiation. such as: a) a decorative object, purifying the medium around the human being (at the desk, for example) by its absorbent properties, supposing a big quartz crystal or a salt mine crystal, coupled with some ampoules of absorbent mixture (a special oil and homeopathic powders, generating a gel); b) a specific type of BR dispersing the telluric radiations (Hartman) etc., the assembly being able to purify the medium of a life / work or of the sleeping room, for example. The evaluation of the BR's stimulating / healthy effects upon the organs most sensitive to radioactivity, was realized with a bioresonance device (METATRON) by eng. Mihai Costache. Figure 18. The optimizing effect of using the ExHo gel of antiradiative protective substances and of the BR5-, determined very relevant comparative states: a) initial state of the thyroid cells (left: bed black point) and after stimulation (right: optimized yellow point): 79 % degree of optimization; b) state of the hypothalamus cells before (left) and after (right) stimulation: 56 % degree of optimization; c) Purkinje's fibres: normal states (left) and stimulated state (right) after using a BR5 - general ExHo stimulator: 77 % degree of optimization. Having in mind all the aspect mentioned above, we could say that the types of protective mechanisms, accorded to different types of radiations, are the following: - reflection of the radioactive waves by using different types of homeopathic remedies, physical or / biological, inserted in different types of protective objects, such as clothing; - absorption of radioactive particles (radioactive de-excitation) at the level of different types of devices such as: decorative objects, furniture pieces etc.; - amplifying the human body's immune system, by ExHo strategies, for increasing its resistance to harmful radiations, by using different types of Biophotonic Resonators, having original forms and functionality; - synergetic combinations of the above mentioned solutions, such as a clothing complex. A series of practical studies and application were already initiated by the authors, for finding the best forms and ways for applying their invention. 4. INCREASE IN FREQUENCY: A CHANCE FOR HUMAN FUTURE TIMES As a general conclusion of the previous scientific research, it should be recalled that all resonators have a common denominator: they contribute to the raising of the frequency of the human bio-psycho-field (aura), man himself being a very complex biophotonic resonator. As already noted, this superior state of the human system is potentially installed in the bio-field from the first minutes of using the BR. But the objective of this performance, of real operation of the human complex on higher frequency levels, requires an action constantly maintained by the person - at the body, soul and spirit level, in the synergy of some vital actions: - bio-physical, correct \"feeding\" of the body with compatible energies, beginning with proper nutrition - especially natural - and up to the (bio) physical materials of one's environment; - psycho-emotional, by removing stress - in all its forms - which gradually erodes health of the soul and, later, that of the body; - mental and spiritual, by installing a superior mentality, based on an understanding of the fact that human beings are always interconnected at higher vibrational levels and that through deliberate connection to these levels, they contribute substantially to the completion of the whole, to which they belong. Achieving such an increase in frequency generates, at the human level, a triple effect - at different levels of manifestation - namely: - optimizing the VITAL FORCE, by EI stimulation of the individual system: body, soul, spirit; - contributing to the conservation of the \"CONNECTION ENERGY\" - at the group level - by generating a harmonious living environment, both from the energetic and informational point of view; - ensuring the generation at the level of MOTHER PLANET of a coherent vibrational state, high in frequency, which - by harmonizing the homeostasis between man and the planet - will allow humanity to exist beyond a predicted catastrophic \"end of time.\" The power to choose between the stress of fear that has generated so much damage to mental and physical health, and harmony of the love feeling, generating the equilibrium, depends only on us. On such a choice depends undoubtedly our vital chance: TO BE OR NOT TO BE AT ALL. * In this last option, essential for the times we are living in, one finds the need for a general harmonization at the collective field level. This is basically the plan of a global therapy, to whose fulfilment \"transpersonal homeopathy\" can contribute - already mentioned by Harry van der Zee [2004]. The \"Biophotonic Resonators\" in all forms mentioned in this study, represent an extremely valuable support for this state of \"collective\" vibration. We can say that - through the subtle mechanisms that are involved and the complex effects they generate - all the BIOPHOTONIC PRODUCTS (of BR type) are constituted as a symbolic \"hard core\" of SYNERGETIC HOMEOPATHY, of an \"integral homeopathy\" whose KNOW-HOW will be able to couple the information-field with energy-substance, to harmonize the interior of the human being with its exterior [5]. An integrated medicine, in other words - which Ann M. Simard is describing [2010], - is one in which the allopathic issues, of energy and substantial type, will be knowingly correlated with those information - radiating type, specific to the complementary therapies. As objective evidence that this is already happening, is the increasing acceptance of specialists and of the public for the ecologic-sanogenous products from the ExHo category. The image of the synergy of effects implied by the BIOPHOTONIC CONCEPT brand - as it is already beginning to be promoted in the world - is an eloquent proof of this. Figure 19. International Exhibitions of Inventics (Ias,i, 2010, Romania): The devices of BIOPHOTONIC CONCEPT based on Exo-Homeopathy: Prof. Dr. Traian D. Stanciulescu, the team coordinator, together with Architect-Designer Dr. Aritia Poenaru (patents' co-author), using a Biopulsar Reflexograph for measuring the BR1 effects upon the BPL properties of the therapist Ioan Davidoni (Timisoara). In fact, every product presented at the exhibition was somehow connected with a specific type of BR, starting from the general one effectively connected to the present persons, to the virtual ones connected to the clothing complex presented on the two models; from the bottle with structured water to the protective BR connected to different leather objects, the unconventional pyramid for generating electricity and the bio-heating source. We could conclude that the presentation of the ExHo products in international resonance places, and their accreditation with excellence awards and reference medals represent an explicit proof of their public recognition. Figure 20. Some symbolic recognitions of the brand BIOPHOTONIC CONCEPT: medals obtained in 2010 in exhibitions and fairs in Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia. The fact that these symbolic assessments have been conferred for a number of inventions coming from the unconventional horizon of biophotonics and coupled with exogenous homeopathy, reveals that worldwide, professionals are beginning to give more credit to alternative solutions to sustain the HUMAN WELL-BEING REVOLUTION. A revolution of the harmonious health by the power of the \"LIVING LIGHT\"... English translation and correction SANDA ROMOSAN & ANN M. SIMARD NOTES [1] It should be noted in this context that, in general, all actual medicine is built on the ability to cure a disease, not to prevent it. Otherwise said, in reality we have medicine faculties or ministries of the disease and not health institutions, because it is not necessary for us to get sick, and to heal ourselves in order to become healthy, but simply that we should not get sick, and stay healthy.... A matter of choice, for a society that accepted illness / disease as a huge source of income ... As if we could not transform the therapeutic homeopathic remedies into prophylactic ones . If it was really interested in this, human society could achieve with relative ease this performance by changing the paradigm, a change in mentality. [2] We remember that EXOGENOUS HOMEOPATHY (ExHo) is a predominantly informational therapy, closely correlated with classical, endogenous homeopathy, which stimulates from outside the process of releasing the resources stored in E-I (energy-information) \"traps\" of the human body, through a \"holographic resonance\" mechanism determined by the ultraweak biophotonic properties - bioluminescence, frequency, intensity, amplitude, etc. - of the (bio) electromagnetic emissions generated by a series of remedies selected, preserved and used in various forms of aggregation (micro- and macrostructural), in order to initiate general or specific effects in the recipient organism. [3] The best known historical complex which was thought since ancient times as one meant to respond to a function similar to the therapeutic one - to harmonize body, soul and spirit - was that one from Epidaurus (Greece). But the recent researches of the historical area, where Sa(ca(r\u00c3\u00a2mb I also a part of it, reveal that the former capital of the kingdom, Sarmisegetusa (Romania), sheltered sacred functions somewhat/ somehow similar.
