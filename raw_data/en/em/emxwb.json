However, as the virus continues to pose a risk, it's important to follow the guidelines below and take the proper steps to protect yourself and your fellow Warriors from future outbreaks. Vaccines Vaccines are no longer required for faculty, staff and students, except for those living in university housing and students and faculty involved in clinical programs. Information on documentation for students living in university housing is available on our [housing website](https://housing.wayne.edu/moving-in). Those involved in clinical programs should contact their program director for vaccine requirements and documentation processes. Although vaccines are not required, the Campus Health Committee strongly recommends remaining up to date on vaccines and boosters. Vaccines and tests are available at the [Campus Health Center](https://health.wayne.edu/coronavirus-vaccine/) (CHC); the CHC will bill insurance companies and work with uninsured and under-insured students to make sure they are able to receive appropriate care without financial burden. Students are also eligible for one free visit to the CHC each semester. Use of the Campus Daily Screener has also been discontinued, as has mandatory COVID-19 testing for those with vaccine waivers. Wayne State University's flu vaccine requirement will remain in effect for all students, faculty and staff for the fall 2023 semester; [documentation may be provided starting Aug. 31 through Nov. 15](https://go.wayne.edu/vaccine-verification). More information on the documentation process will be available by the end of August. Masks Face masks are optional in most campus locations. Those who wish to continue wearing masks while on campus are encouraged to do so. Please remember that all students, faculty and staff have the right to ask individuals to wear masks when in their private office, apartment or meeting space. Please keep the safety and comfort of your fellow Warriors in mind and be willing to wear a mask if requested. Stay home if you feel ill If you have symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19, stay home and, if possible, take a COVID-19 test. If you test positive, please isolate [according to CDC requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). The Campus Health Center will arrange testing for those living on campus who experience symptoms of COVID-19. Faculty and staff resources Information regarding hybrid schedules and flexible work arrangements are available on the [HR website](https://hr.wayne.edu/flexible-work-arrangements). Please speak to your supervisor if you have any questions or to address any health or safety concerns. We will continue to monitor state and regional data, as well as new guidance from the CDC and information concerning new variants or other risks and may amend these requirements as necessary.
