Some fear they aresuffering from chronic disabling conditions because of wartime exposuresto one or more agents with known or suspected health effects. This reportresponds to the mandate of the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization actthat we analyze the effectiveness of the government's clinical care andmedical research programs relating to illnesses that members of the armedforces might have contracted as a result of their service in the Gulf War. 1 Specifically, we evaluated (1) the Department of Defense's ( DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs' ( VA) efforts to assess the quality of treatment and diagnostic services provided to Gulf War veterans and theirprovisions for follow-up of initial examinations, (2) the government'sresearch strategy to study the veterans' illnesses and the methodologicalproblems posed in its studies, and (3) the consistency of key officialconclusions with available data on the causes of veterans' illnesses. BackgroundDuring their deployment associated with the Persian Gulf War, U.S. troopsmight have been exposed to a variety of potentially hazardous substances.These substances include compounds used to decontaminate equipmentand protect it against chemical agents, fuel used as a sand suppressant inand around encampments, fuel oil used to burn human waste, fuel in 1Our response to the referenced legislation resulted in two additional studies: Defense Health Care: Medical Surveillance Has Improved Since the Gulf War, but Results in Bosnia Are Mixed (GAO/NSIAD-97-136 , May 13, 1997) and a classified report issued earlier this year on biological agent defense. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 1 B-276835 shower water, leaded vehicle exhaust used to dry sleeping bags, depleted uranium, parasites, pesticides, drugs to protect against chemical warfareagents (such as pyridostigmine bromide), and smoke from oil-well fires. DOD acknowledged in June 1996 that some veterans may have been exposed to the nerve agent sarin following the postwar demolition of Iraqiammunition facilities. Shortly after the war, some veterans began reporting health problems that they believed might be due to exposure to chemicals, pesticides, and otheragents used during the war. Accordingly, both DOD and VA established programs through which Gulf War veterans could receive medicalexaminations and diagnostic services. From 1992 to 1994, VA participants received a regular physical examination with basic laboratory tests, and in1994, VA established a standardized examination to obtain information about exposures and symptoms related to diseases endemic to the Gulfregion and to incorporate specific tests to detect the \"biochemicalfingerprints\" of certain diseases. If a diagnosis was not apparent, thestandard examination protocols provided for up to 22 additional tests andprovided for additional specialty consultations. If the illness defieddiagnosis, VA registrants might have been sent to one of four VA Persian Gulf referral centers. DOD initiated its Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program in June 1994. It was primarily intended to provide diagnostic services similar to the VA program and employed a similar clinical protocol. However, the VA program was among the first extensive efforts to gather data fromveterans regarding the nature of their problems and the types of hazardousagents to which they might have been exposed. (See app. I for details.) Results in BriefOur review found that (1) although efforts have been made to diagnoseveterans' problems and care has been provided to many eligible veterans,neither DOD nor VA has systematically attempted to determine whether ill Gulf War veterans are any better or worse today than when they were firstexamined; (2) while the ongoing epidemiological research will providedescriptive data on veterans' illnesses, formidable methodologicalproblems are likely to prevent researchers from providing precise,accurate, and conclusive answers regarding the causes of veterans'illnesses; and (3) support for some official conclusions regarding stress,leishmaniasis, and exposure to chemical agents was weak or subject toalternative interpretations. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 2 B-276835 Over 100,000 of the approximately 700,000 Gulf War veterans have participated in DOD and VA health examination programs established after the war. Based on the examinations and reports provided by DOD and VA, nearly 90 percent of the examined veterans are symptomatic, reporting awide array of health complaints and disabling conditions. While VA and DOD health examination programs have sought to evaluate these veterans'problems and refer eligible veterans for further care, neither DOD nor VA currently has mechanisms in place to determine whether these ill veteransare any better or worse today than when they were first examined. Bothagencies have tried to measure or ensure the quality of veterans' initialexaminations. While some measures of quality are in place for military or VA health care in general, neither agency can now determine the appropriateness or effectiveness of the treatment received by ill Gulf Warveterans. 2 Federal research on Gulf War veterans' illnesses has not been pursuedproactively. Although these veterans' health problems began surfacing inthe early 1990s, the vast majority of research was not initiated until 1994 orlater. And, much of this research was associated with legislation orexternal reviewers' recommendations. Thus, although at least 91 studieshave received federal financial support, about four-fifths of the fundedstudies are not complete, and certain studies will not be available untilafter 2000. Some hypotheses (for example, that veterans' currentsymptoms are due to stress) were pursued earlier and more aggressivelythan others (for example, that symptoms are due to low-level exposure tochemical warfare agents), and some hypotheses that were initiallyunfunded by the federal government (for example, that symptoms are dueto the delayed chronic effects of exposure to organophosphates, 3 which were in pesticides used in the Gulf) were pursued with private sectorfunding. In recent years, VA and DOD have significantly broadened their research programs, to include efforts to seek external advice. Without accurate exposure information, the investment of millions of dollars in further epidemiological research on the risk factors (or potentialcauses) for veterans' illnesses may result in little return. The government'sresearch has primarily involved epidemiological studies, most of whichfocus on the nature and prevalence of the veterans' symptoms andillnesses or the identification of causes for the illnesses. While mortality 2We are conducting further work addressing medical care provided to Gulf War veterans. See VA Health Care: Observations on Medical Care Provided to Persian Gulf Veterans (GAO/T-HEHS-97-158 , June 19, 1997). 3Organophosphates are a class of chemicals found in some pesticides and chemical warfare agents. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 3 B-276835 information and data on the prevalence of various problems may be valuable, because of formidable methodological problems facinginvestigators, epidemiological research on Gulf War veterans' illnesses willnot be able to provide precise, accurate, and conclusive answers regardingthe causes of veterans' illnesses. Specifically, studies generally arehampered by the lack of (1) accurate, person-based, dose-specificexposure data; (2) known biological markers (such as detectableantibodies to specific agents or diseases); and (3) specific case definition(definition of particular syndromes or clusters of symptoms to study). While some prevalence data may be useful, we agree with the Institute of Medicine and the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans'Illnesses. 4 that population-based comparisons that group together veterans with varied exposures may mask higher rates of illness among veteranswith specific exposure histories. The plans for toxicological research onthe health effects of low-level exposures to various agents will be useful inefforts to determine whether veterans' current unexplained symptoms orconditions are consistent with such exposure. To date, the researchprogram has not included an assessment of the clinical progress of ill GulfWar veterans, which is critical to identifying the appropriateness andeffectiveness of their treatment and could be useful to provide direction tothe research agenda. Six years after the war, little is conclusively known about the causes of Gulf War veterans' illnesses. Not only were few strong, conclusivestatements made in the executive branch reports we reviewed, but supportwas weak or subject to alternative interpretation for three conclusionsmade by the Presidential Advisory Committee and endorsed by DOD. In addition, two questions remain unresolved. First, the Committee concluded that stress is likely to be an important contributing factor to the broad range of illnesses currently being reportedby Gulf War veterans and that studies have found higher rates ofposttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in Gulf War veterans. However, the link between stress and these veterans' physical symptoms is not wellestablished in the evidence the Committee cited, and the reportedprevalence of PTSD among Gulf War veterans may be overestimated because of problems in the methods used in studies to identify it (forexample, there were frequent failures to exclude physical causes for 4See Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, Final Report (Washington, D.C.: GPO), December 1996. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 4 B-276835 veterans' symptoms or to conduct structured clinical interviews, which are necessary components of PTSD diagnosis). Second, based on a small number of diagnosed cases, VA and DOD concluded that the likelihood of leishmania tropica (a parasite) as an important risk factor for widely reported illness has diminished and theCommittee found it unlikely to be \"responsible for long term health effectsin Gulf War veterans.\" However, the extent of asymptomatic leishmaniainfection is unknown, and the possibility of prolonged latency andapparent clinical dormancy (up to 20 years) of an infection that mayreemerge in the presence of immune deficiency underscores the need toretain leishmania among the potential risk factors. Third, the Committee concluded that it was unlikely that the health effects reported by Gulf War veterans are the results of exposure toorganophosphate or mustard chemical warfare agents, even though thereis substantial evidence that organophosphate compounds might beassociated with delayed or long-term health effects similar to thoseexperienced by the Gulf War veterans. Unresolved questions concern the extent to which veterans may have been exposed to (1) chemical agents as a result of fallout from the destructionof suspected chemical weapons storage sites and (2) the biological agentaflatoxin, the health effects of which may not be known for months, oreven years, after exposure. DOD and VA Have No Systematic Approachto Monitoring GulfWar Veterans' HealthAfter InitialExaminationDOD and VA officials have testified that whatever uncertainties may exist about the cause of Gulf War veterans' illnesses, the veterans are receivingappropriate and effective symptomatic treatment. However, DOD and VA have no mechanism to monitor the quality, appropriateness, oreffectiveness of care provided to Gulf War veterans after their initialexamination. Furthermore, DOD and VA officials said they had no plans to establish a mechanism to monitor these veterans' progress. Thismonitoring and follow-up is important not only to ensure that diagnosedconditions are properly treated but also because (1) undiagnosed signsand symptoms are not uncommon among ill veterans, (2) treatment forveterans with undiagnosed conditions is based on their symptoms, and(3) veterans with undiagnosed conditions or multiple diagnoses may seemultiple providers. These agencies have relied on such mechanisms astraining and standards for physician qualification, which may not besufficient to ensure a given level of effectiveness for the care provided or GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 5 B-276835 do not permit identification of the most effective treatments.4 In contrast, some steps have been taken to monitor quality and patient satisfactionwith veterans' initial registry examinations. (See app. II for details.) Federal Research Strategy Lacks aCoherent ApproachThe bulk of ongoing federal research currently focuses on the epidemiological study of veterans' illnesses. While this approach may yielddescriptive data on veterans' mortality and general health profiles,methodological problems facing government epidemiological research onGulf War veterans' illnesses will severely limit its ability to identify thepotential causes of the illnesses. Initially, the government was notproactive in acknowledging and collecting data on the factors that mighthave caused Gulf War veterans' health problems, and the research agendawas not articulated until several years after the war ended. Delays and Focus of Federal Research AreHindering OutcomesOur review of research projects and interviews with agency officials showed that the vast majority of federal research was not initiated until1994. This 3-year delay has complicated the task facing researchers. Inaddition, it has limited the amount of completed research currentlyavailable. Of the 91 federally sponsored studies, 72 were ongoing when wereviewed them in early 1997, and some of the studies will not be completeuntil 2000 or later. The focus of federal research has primarily been the epidemiological study of the prevalence and cause of Gulf War illnesses rather than thediagnosis, treatment, and prevention of them. With respect to determiningthe causes, researchers will likely continue to find it difficult to detecteffects of particular wartime exposure and to eliminate alternativeexplanations for Gulf War veterans' illnesses because of the absence ofvalid and reliable data on exposures and the multiplicity of agents towhich the veterans were exposed. Data on the prevalence of varioushealth problems can be useful but requires careful interpretation in theabsence of better information on the factors to which veterans wereexposed. While multiple studies of the role of stress in the veterans'illnesses have been supported with federal research dollars, basictoxicological questions regarding the substances to which they wereexposed remain unanswered. Finally, there is an absence of efforts tomeasure Gulf War veterans' clinical progress. This leaves the governmentunable to promptly determine the quality and effectiveness of treatments 4See VA Health Care: Observations on Medical Care Provided to Persian Gulf Veterans (GAO/T-HEHS-97-158 , June 19, 1997). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 6 B-276835 currently being provided to Gulf War veterans or to use this information when funding additional clinical research. Methodological Problems Limit the Effectiveness ofOngoing EpidemiologicalResearchFederal researchers studying Gulf War illnesses have faced a number of challenges and encountered significant problems in linking exposures orpotential causes to observed illnesses or symptoms. Researchers have found it extremely difficult to gather information aboutunplanned exposures in the Gulf to such things as oil fire smoke andinsects carrying infection, and DOD has acknowledged that records of the use of pyridostigmine bromide and vaccinations to protect againstchemical/biological warfare exposures were inadequate. Gulf War veterans were typically exposed to a wide array of agents,making it difficult to isolate and characterize the effects of individualagents or to study their combined effects. Most epidemiological studies have relied only on self-reports formeasuring most of the agents to which veterans may have been exposedduring the Gulf War. The passage of time following these exposures has made it increasinglydifficult to have confidence in any information gathered about themthrough retrospective questioning of veterans. Reliance on self-reportingto assess exposures has two problems. Veterans' recall after such a longtime period may be inaccurate or biased. Moreover, there is often nostraightforward way to test the validity of self-reported exposureinformation, making it impossible to separate bias in recalled informationfrom actual differences in the frequency of exposures. As a result, findingsfrom these studies may be spurious or equivocal. Classifying the symptoms and identifying illnesses of Gulf War veteranshave been difficult. From the outset, symptoms reported by veterans havebeen varied and difficult to classify into one or more distinct illnesses.Moreover, several different diagnoses might provide plausibleexplanations for some of the specific health complaints. It has thus beendifficult to develop a case definition (that is, a reliable way to identifyindividuals with a specific disease), which is a criterion for doing effectiveepidemiological research. Appendix III provides more detailed information on the nature and extent of the federal government's research efforts. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 7 B-276835 Support for Key GovernmentConclusions Is Weakor Subject toAlternativeInterpretationsIn the absence of official conclusions from DOD and VA, we examined conclusions drawn in December 1996 by the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, which was established by thePresident to review the activities of the executive branch regarding GulfWar veterans' illnesses. In January 1997, DOD endorsed the Committee's conclusions about the likelihood that exposure to 10 commonly citedagents contributed to the explained and unexplained illnesses of theseveterans. We found that the evidence to support several of theseconclusions is either weak or subject to alternative interpretations. The Committee concluded that \"stress is likely to be an important contributing factor to the broad range of illnesses currently being reportedby Gulf War veterans.\" While stress can induce physical illness, the linkbetween stress and these veterans' physical symptoms has not been firmlyestablished by the evidence the Committee cited. For example, alarge-scale, federally funded study concluded that \"for those veterans whodeployed to the Gulf War and currently report physical symptoms, neitherstress nor exposure to combat or its aftermath bear much relationship totheir distress.\" The Committee has stated that \"epidemiological studies toassess the effects of stress invariably have found higher rates ofposttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in Gulf War veterans than among individuals in nondeployed units or in the general U.S. population of thesame age.\" Our review indicated that the prevalence of PTSD among Gulf War veterans may be overestimated due to problems in the methods usedto identify it. Specifically, the studies on PTSD to which the Committee refers have not excluded other conditions, such as neurological disordersthat produce symptoms similar to PTSD and can also elevate scores on key measures of PTSD . We also believe that the use of broad and heterogenous groups of diagnoses (e.g., \"psychological conditions\" \u2014 ranging fromtension headache to major depression) in reporting data from DOD's clinical program may contribute to overestimation of the extent of seriouspsychological illnesses among Gulf War veterans. The Committee also concluded that \"it is unlikely that infectious diseases endemic to the Gulf region are responsible for long term health effects inGulf War veterans, except in a small known number of individuals.\"Similarly, the Persian Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board ( PGVCB )5 concluded that because of the small number of reported cases, \"thelikelihood of Leishmania tropica as an important risk factor for widelyreported illness has diminished.\" While this is the case for observed 5The PGVCB, comprised of the Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, is charged with coordinating the federal response to Gulf War veterans' illnesses. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 8 B-276835 symptomatic infection with the parasite, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection is unknown, and such infection may reemerge in cases in whichthe patient's immune system becomes deficient. However, as theCommittee has noted, the infection may remain dormant up to 20 years.Because of this long latency and the lack of widely available screeningmethods, the infected population is hidden, and because even classicforms of Leishmaniasis are difficult to recognize, we believe thatLeishmania should be retained as a potential risk factor for individualswho suffer from immune deficiency. The Committee also concluded that it is unlikely that the health effects reported by many Gulf War veterans were the result of (1) biologicalwarfare agents, (2) chemical warfare agents, (3) depleted uranium,(4) infectious diseases endemic to the region, (5) oil-well fire smoke,(6) pesticides, (7) petroleum products, (8) pyridostigmine bromide, or(9) vaccines. However, our review of the conclusions made by theCommittee indicated the following: While the government found no evidence that biological weapons weredeployed, during the Gulf War, the United States did not deploy a real-timebiological warfare agent detection system during the war, and the effectsof one agent, aflatoxin, would not be observed for many years. Evidence from various sources indicates that chemical agents werepresent at Khamisiyah, Iraq, and elsewhere on the battlefield. Themagnitude of the exposure to chemical agents has not been fully resolved.As we have previously noted, \"available bomb damage assessments duringthe war concluded that 16 of 21 sites categorized by Gulf War planners asnuclear, biological, and chemical ( NBC) facilities had been successfully destroyed. However, information compiled by the United Nations SpecialCommission ( UNSCOM ) since the end of Desert Storm reveals that the number of suspected NBC targets identified by U.S. planners, both prior to and during the campaign, did not fully encompass all the possible NBC targets identified by U.S. planners. UNSCOM has conducted investigations at a large number of the facilities suspected by the U.S. authorities as being NBC related. Regarding the few suspected chemical weapon sites that have not yet been inspected by UNSCOM , we have been able to determine that each was attacked by coalition aircraft during Desert Storm and that onesite is located within the Kuwait theater of operation in close proximity tothe border, where coalition ground forces were located. However, we haveyet to learn why these facilities have not been investigated.\" 6 6Operation Desert Storm: Evaluation of the Air Campaign (GAO/NSIAD-97-134 , June 12, 1997), p. 2. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 9 B-276835 Exposure to certain organophosphates can induce a delayed neurological condition without causing immediate symptoms. Available research indicates that exposure to combinations ofpyridostigmine bromide and other chemicals used during the Gulf War cancause damaging health effects greater than to these agents individually. (See app. IV for details.) RecommendationsBecause of the numbers of Gulf War veterans who continue to experience illnesses that may be related to their service during the Gulf War, werecommend that the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with theSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, (1) develop andimplement a plan to monitor the clinical progress of Gulf War veterans inorder to help promote appropriate and effective treatment and providedirection to the research agenda and (2) give greater priority to researchon treatment for ill veterans and on low-level exposures to chemicals andtheir interactive effects and less priority to further epidemiological studies.We also recommend that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairsrefine the current approaches of the clinical and research programs fordiagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder consistent with suggestionsrecently made by the Institute of Medicine, which noted the need forimproved documentation of screening procedures and patient histories(including occupational and environmental exposures) and the importanceof ruling out alternative causes of impairment. Agency Comments and Our EvaluationWe obtained comments on a draft of this report from DOD, VA, and the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses. DOD partially concurred with the report, indicating that the thrust of therecommendations had merit but did not fully take into account thecomplex set of health outcomes related to the war and did not recognize DOD's accomplishments. DOD also noted that our findings differed from those of the Institute of Medicine and the Committee and commented thatwe had not carried out the same level of careful and thoughtful assessmentas had those committees. VA commented that although some aspects of our report have merit, our recommendations reflected a lack of understanding of clinical research,epidemiology, and toxicology. VA indicated that (1) the creation of a new database was not likely to provide accurate and valid assessment of theseGulf War veterans' health status; (2) DOD and VA are already giving greater GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 10 B-276835 priority to research on low-level exposures to chemicals, but do not want to give less priority to epidemiological research; and (3) VA was already making efforts to improve current approaches to PTSD and other stress-related disorders. The Presidential Advisory Committee commented that our draft contained factual errors, did not provide references or citations to scientificliterature, lacked substantiation and analytic rigor, and should not beissued in its current form. The Committee was particularly concerned withour finding that the support or evidence it had for some of its conclusionswas weak. None of the comments we received provide evidence to challenge our principal findings and conclusions that (1) DOD and VA have no means to systematically determine whether symptomatic Gulf War veterans arebetter or worse today than when they were first examined and (2) ongoingepidemiological research will not provide precise, accurate, andconclusive answers regarding the causes of the Gulf War veterans'illnesses. All of the comments we received seek to shift the onus ofidentifying and substantiating the causes of Gulf War illnesses to us, whenin fact we merely reviewed the sufficiency and persuasiveness of theevidence behind the administration's conclusions. In some instances, wefound it to be weak or open to alternative interpretation. We believe theburden of proof is still on those who have made the assertions about thelikely and unlikely causes of the illnesses. Nevertheless, in light of the comments we received, we have added more citations to the scientific support and documentation and modified thelanguage in the text to clarify our position so that other readers will notmisconstrue the meaning of our report. We also double-checked theinformation that was challenged in the comments we received and foundthat the data as originally presented was correct. Therefore, the thrust ofour message remains unchanged. Our point-by-point evaluation of the detailed comments provided by DOD, VA, and the Committee are provided in appendixes V-VII. However, because the Committee's comments were the most strident, our evaluationof its key points is summarized as follows. Regarding stress, the Committee states that we ignored its analytical approach, which was to compare the \"known health effects of the riskfactor to the symptoms reported by Gulf War veterans.\" We found, GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 11 B-276835 however, that the Committee offered little evidence that stress was an important contributor of the \"broad range\" of veterans' symptoms. Giventhe nonspecific nature of the health effects associated with stress, almostany pattern of symptoms and illnesses would be compatible with it,making it difficult to scientifically test the hypothesis posed by theCommittee's approach (that the pattern of veterans' illnesses is consistentwith the known effects of stress). Although the Committee notes thatscores on PTSD screening questionnaires are higher among Gulf veterans than among controls, confirmatory psychiatric interviews to eliminatealternative explanations for elevated PTSD screening scores were generally not done. Because we questioned the Committee's support for its conclusion that the likelihood of Leishmania infection has diminished as an explanation forwidespread illness, the Committee sought to transfer the burden of proofto us by asking that we justify any continued concern about asymptomaticinfection. We found that the Committee's justification for dismissal ofLeishmania as a risk factor rests heavily on two ill-supported assumptions:(1) that diagnostic programs have been highly likely to detect the disease,even in the absence of any widely available screening or diagnostic testsand in the presence of nonspecific symptoms, and (2) that the course ofvarious forms of leishmaniasis is well understood by scientists and by thedoctors examining the veterans. Insofar as the prevalence of this infectionis still unknown and it is impossible to predict which veterans' immunesystems will be weakened, and given the inability to identify this hiddenpopulation in the absence of a valid screening test, we believe it ispremature to discount leishmania as a risk factor. Finally, regarding our evaluation of the Committee's conclusion that low-level exposures to chemicals such as pesticides are unlikely to beassociated with veterans' health conditions, the Committee appears not tocontest the fact that laboratory data document specific health effects inanimals exposed to one or more organophosphate agents that are notdetectable in the usual clinical tests. We find it difficult to reconcile theCommittee's dismissal of such exposure as an \"unlikely\" cause of veterans'health problems with its acknowledgement of an absence of data on animportant exposure scenario. Moreover, where the Committee apparentlyfound no data to suggest a problem with low-level exposures, we foundsome data that do pose concerns. While the Committee argues that thesestudies were done on animals, they are consistent with standardtoxicological practice employed by the Environmental Protection Agencyand others. The Committee's insistence that such effects be demonstrated GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 12 B-276835 in humans appears unreasonable, as exposing humans to toxic substances for experimental research cannot be done for obvious ethical reasons.Also, while the study of occupational or accidental exposures, such as thesarin exposures that occurred in Japanese terrorist incidents, may providesome degree of information, the value of such information is generallylimited by the poor description of the actual levels of the exposure in thecase of accidents, the limited range of exposures (in the case ofoccupational use), or the lack of comparability with the circumstance inquestion. The hypotheses derived from such study would thus requireconfirmation and testing in controlled experimental settings. DOD provided two sets of comments, which we have reprinted in appendix V. We responded to DOD's second set of comments, received on June 17, 1997, by incorporating appropriate changes in our report. VA and the Presidential Advisory Committee's comments are reprinted in appendixesVI and VII, respectively. Scope and MethodologyTo address our first objective\u2014the extent of DOD's and VA's clinical follow-up and monitoring of treatment and diagnostic services\u2014wereviewed literature and agency documents and conducted structuredinterviews with DOD and VA officials managing the respective agencies' registries for Persian Gulf War veterans that requested postwarevaluations. We asked questions designed to identify and contrast theirmethods for monitoring the quality and outcomes of their treatment anddiagnostic programs and the health of the registered veterans. The second objective concerns the government's research strategy to study the veterans' illnesses and the methodological problems posed in itsstudies. To answer this question we conducted a systematic review ofpertinent literature and agency documents and reports, including reportsissued by the Presidential Advisory Committee and the Institute ofMedicine. We also interviewed representatives of PGVCB 's Research Working Group and officials of VA and DOD. We surveyed primary investigators of ongoing epidemiological studies. We also collected dataon project expenditures by fiscal year but did not attempt toindependently verify these figures. Because different methodological standards apply to various types of research and because the overwhelming majority of federally sponsoredresearch is categorized as epidemiological, we limited our survey ofinvestigators to those responsible for ongoing epidemiological studies. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 13 B-276835 With an expert epidemiological consultant, we devised a questionnaire to assess critical elements of these studies (including the quality of exposuremeasurement, specificity of case definition, and steps to ensure adequatesample size) and to identify specific problems that the primaryinvestigators may have encountered in implementing their studies. Of the43 ongoing epidemiological studies identified by PGVCB in the November 1996 plan, we interviewed primary investigators for 31 (72 percent). Wealso reviewed and categorized descriptions of all 91 projects identified byApril 1997, based on their apparent focus and primary objective. Finally, toreview the progress of major ongoing research efforts, we visited theWalter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Naval Health ResearchCenter, and two of VA's Environmental Hazards Research Centers. To address the third objective, we reviewed major conclusions of the PGVCB and the Presidential Advisory Committee to determine the strength of evidence supporting these conclusions. The purpose of this review wasnot to critique PGVCB 's or the Presidential Advisory Committee's efforts, per se, but rather to describe the amount of knowledge about Gulf Warillnesses that has been generated by research 6 years after the war. Wereviewed these conclusions because they were the strongest statementsthat we had come across on these matters by any official body. ThePresidential Advisory Committee's report was significant because thepanel included a number of recognized experts in the scientific questionsat issue who were assisted by a large staff of scientists and attorneys. Inaddition, the Committee conducted an extensive review of the research.Thus, evaluating these conclusions provided important evidence abouthow fruitful the federal research had been thus far. To address thisobjective, we reviewed scientific literature cited by the PresidentialAdvisory Committee as well as others. We also consulted experts in thefields of epidemiology, toxicology, and medicine and interviewed officialsof DOD, VA, and the Central Intelligence Agency. We checked our own interpretation of key study findings with the authors and had independentexperts review our draft report. Because of the scientific and multidisciplinary nature of this issue, we ensured that staff conducting the work had appropriate backgrounds inthe fields of epidemiology, statistics, psychology, environmental health,toxicology, engineering, weapon design, and program evaluation andmethodology. In addition, we used in-house expertise in chemical andbiological warfare and in military and veterans health care systems. Also,experts who reviewed our work had backgrounds in medicine, publichealth, and research methods. Moreover, we held extensive discussions GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 14 B-276835 with experts in academia in each of the substantive fields relevant to this issue. Our work was completed between October 1996 and April 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressionalcommittees; the Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Health andHuman Services; the Chair of the Presidential Advisory Committee; andother interested parties.

The Department of VeteransAffairs ( VA) and the Department of Defense ( DOD) later initiated health programs offering physical examinations and diagnostic services to theseveterans. As it became apparent that the symptoms and causes of theseillnesses varied widely and the illnesses were difficult to diagnose, thegovernment began to research the reasons for the veterans' healthproblems. U.S. Troops' Exposure to HazardousSubstancesDuring their service in the Gulf, U.S. troops were reportedly exposed before, during, and after the war to a variety of potentially hazardoussubstances. These include decontaminating and protective compounds(particularly decontaminating solution 2, DS2, and chemical agent resistant coating ( CARC )), diesel fuel used as a sand suppressant in and around encampments, fuel oil used to burn human waste, fuel in showerwater, and leaded vehicle exhaust used to dry sleeping bags. For example,as we reported to staff of the House Subcommittee on Oversight andInvestigations in 1994, DS2 was to be widely distributed among Army units and equipment in Saudi Arabia, though the Army did not know how muchor where the solution was distributed. The potential effects of DS2 on humans include mild or severe burns, corrosion to tissues of the skin oreye, liver damage, and adverse reproductive effects. 7 Other potential hazards associated with Gulf service included infectious diseases (mostprominently leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection), the use of pyridostigminebromide and vaccines (to protect against chemical and biologicalweapons), depleted uranium (contained in certain ammunition and in thefragments of exploded rounds), pesticides and insect repellents, chemicaland biological warfare agents, and compounds and particulate mattercontained in the extensive smoke from the oil-well fires at the end of thewar. Shortly after the war, some veterans began reporting health problems that they believed might be due to their participation in the war. As we noted inMay 1995, the 123rd Army Reserve Unit in Indiana reported unexpectedsigns and symptoms that could not easily be explained. 8 Veterans in other 7Also see Hazardous Materials: DOD Should Eliminate DS2 From Its Inventory of Decontaminants (GAO/NSIAD-90-10 , Apr. 25, 1990). 8Operation Desert Storm: Health Concerns of Selected Indiana Persian Gulf War Veterans (GAO/HEHS-95-102 , May 1995). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 20 Appendix I Government Health and Research Programsfor Gulf War Veterans units began to report similar symptoms that also could not be easily explained. Many veterans reported exposure to chemicals, pesticides, andother agents, such as vaccines and pyridostigmine bromide, as possiblecauses of their illnesses. Health Examination Programs for Gulf WarVeteransConsistent with the Veteran's Health Care Act of 1992, both VA and DOD have established programs through which they provide medical examination and diagnostic services, free of charge, to Gulf War veterans.The VA launched its Persian Gulf Health Registry Examination Program (PGHREP ) in 1992, and DOD initiated the Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program ( CCEP ) in June 1994. PGHREP is currently available at most VA medical centers, and DOD's CCEP examinations are available at 148 sites worldwide.9 Initially, PGHREP participants received a regular physical examination with basic laboratory tests. However, in 1994, VA established a standardized examination to (1) obtain information about symptoms and exposures;(2) call the clinician's attention to diseases endemic to the Gulf region; and(3) direct baseline laboratory studies, including a chest X-ray (if one hasnot been done recently), blood count, urinalysis, and blood chemistry andenzyme analyses for detection of certain diseases. If a diagnosis is notapparent, facilities follow the clinical evaluation protocol originallydeveloped for VA's referral centers and now used in VA and military medical centers nationwide. The examination protocol suggests 22 additionalbaseline tests and additional specialty consultations, from which furtherdiagnostic procedures may be considered, depending on the veteran'ssymptoms. If the illness cannot be diagnosed, a VA registrant may be referred to one of four VA Persian Gulf Referral Centers located in Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; andBirmingham, Alabama. Although these registry programs are primarily intended to provide diagnostic services, the VA's registry program, in particular, was among the first extensive efforts to gather data from veterans regarding the nature oftheir problems and the types of factors to which they might have beenexposed. However, during the first 2 years of the PGHREP 's operation, when exposure and symptom information was freshest in most respondents' 9A declining proportion of Gulf War veterans are covered by military medical health services. Thus, an increasing number would be eligible only for VA care, and some portion have access to neither VA norDOD health care services apart from the PGHREP and CCEP examination programs. It is important tonote that receipt of a VA registry examination does not entail eligibility for free treatment of anyconditions detected. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 21 Appendix I Government Health and Research Programsfor Gulf War Veterans memory, efforts to collect data on symptoms and self-reported exposure(s) were more limited in scope. In February 1997, the VA reported its analysis of the self-reported exposures to hazardous substances identified by the 3,181 veterans whoregistered after the VA revised its data collection forms. Although interpreting such information is difficult due to self-selection of registryparticipants and problems with retrospective reporting based on recall,many veterans reported exposure to multiple substances. VA reported that 89 percent of these registered veterans believed they had been exposed todiesel or other petrochemical fumes, 88 percent to passive smoking,72 percent to smoke from oil fires, 72 percent to skin exposure to fuel,70 percent to burning trash/feces, 64 percent to smoke from tent heaters,64 percent to pesticides in cream or spray form, 60 percent topyridostigmine bromide, 53 percent to paints or solvents, 34 percent tomicrowaves, 32 percent to CARC , 14 percent to depleted uranium, 12 percent to nerve gas, and 6 percent to mustard gas.10 (See fig. I.1.) As of June 1996, DOD acknowledged the potential exposure of some veterans to the nerve agent sarin following the postwar U.S. demolition of Iraqiammunition facilities. 10H.

Government Research ProgramIn addition to providing examination services, in the 6 years since the end of the Gulf War, the federal government, primarily through DOD and VA, has sponsored a variety of research on Gulf War veterans' illnesses. DOD research is one component of a broader agenda coordinated under theaegis of the Persian Gulf Veterans' Coordinating Board ( PGVCB ), which comprises the Secretaries of the Department of Health and HumanServices ( HHS), VA, and DOD. The details of this agenda are described in the PGVCB publication entitled A Working Plan for Research on Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses , first published in 1995 and revised in November 1996.11 11A Working Plan for Research on Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses (First Revision),\" Department of Veterans Affairs, November 1996. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 23 Appendix I Government Health and Research Programsfor Gulf War Veterans This agenda was developed in response to an Institute of Medicine ( IOM) conclusion that \"the DOD and VA should determine the specific research questions that need to be answered. Epidemiologic studies should be designed with the objective of answering these questionsgiven the input of experts in epidemiologic research methods and data analysis, along withthe input of experts in the subject matter areas to be investigated.\" Accordingly, most of the research sponsored under this agenda is characterized by PGVCB as epidemiological. The objectives of epidemiologic study are to determine the extent of disease in the population, the causes of disease and its modes oftransmission, the natural history of disease, and the basis for developingpreventive strategies or interventions. 12 To conduct such studies, investigators must follow a few basic, generallyaccepted principles. First, they must specify diagnostic criteria to(1) reliably determine who has the disease or condition being studied andwho does not and (2) select appropriate controls (people who do not havethe disease or condition). Second, the investigators must have valid and reliable methods of collecting data on the past exposure(s) of those in the study to possiblefactors that may have caused the symptoms. The need for accurate,dose-specific exposure information is particularly critical when low-levelor intermittent exposure to drugs, chemicals, or air pollutants is possible.It is important not only to assess the presence or absence of exposure butalso to characterize the intensity and duration of exposure. To the extentthat the actual exposure of individuals is misclassified, it is difficult todetect any effects of the exposure. Another means of linkingenvironmental factors to disease is to determine whether or not there isevidence that as the exposure increases, the risk of disease also increases.However, this dose-response pattern can be detected only if the degree ofexposure among different groups can be determined. Finally, in addition to specific case definition and dose-specific exposure information with known accuracy, it is important that a sufficient numberof persons be studied to have a reasonable likelihood of detecting any 12A. M. Lilienfeld and D. E. Lilienfeld, Foundations of Epidemiology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1980); L. Goodis, Epidemiology (Philadelphia, PA: W. B. Saunders Company, 1996); and D. E. Lilienfeld and P. D. Stolley, Foundations of Epidemiology 3rd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 24 Appendix I Government Health and Research Programsfor Gulf War Veterans relationship between exposures and disease. To the extent that this relationship is subtle or obscured by loose case definition (that is, a casedefinition that is too broad and encompasses different types of illnesses)or problems in measuring exposure, larger samples would be required. Forexample, the IOM has noted that \"very large groups must be studied in order to identify the small risks associated with low levels of exposure, whereas a relatively small study may be able to detect the effect ofheavy or sustained exposure to a toxic substance. In this way, a study's precision orstatistical power is also linked to the extent of the exposure and the accuracy of itsmeasurement. Inaccurate assessment of exposure can obscure the existence of such atrend and thus make it less likely that a true risk will be identified.\" 13 Research programs, such as the federal program for Gulf War illnesses, are designed to lead to information and treatments in a timely and efficientmanner. In the conventional model of epidemiological research, a researchprogram to investigate a disease outbreak follows a study cycle. (See fig.I.2 for an illustration of this cycle.) 14 First, descriptive studies are conducted to gather basic information about patterns of illness, thenatural environment, and exposures of interest (step one). Once enoughinformation is gathered, researchers create hypotheses to explain the patterns that they see in these descriptive data (step two). Analytic studies are then conducted to test the hypotheses (step three). The results ofthese analytic studies are evaluated (step four). They may suggest a needto gather additional descriptive data (step one), or they may yield new orrefined hypotheses (step two) to be tested in further analytic studies (stepthree). The cycle continues until the disease is adequately understood topermit the development of treatments. Applying this cycle is a useful wayof organizing a research program when valid descriptive information canbe acquired about exposures and dose/response relationships. However,when this information is not available, retaining this model, that isconducting descriptive studies that lead to hypotheses that are then tested,may not be timely or effective. 13Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 1996 (Washington, D.C.: Institute of Medicine, 1996), pp. 99-100. 14This research model is shared by other scientific fields that also develop hypotheses and then test them through field or laboratory research.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 26 Appendix II No Systematic Approach for Monitoring Veterans' Treatment After InitialExamination Most veterans with symptoms who were evaluated in the VA and DOD health programs received a diagnosis (78 percent and 80 percent, respectively), while at least 20 percent have symptoms or signs that eludediagnosis. However, an analysis of 222 VA registrants in Portland, Oregon, showed that only 19 percent had symptoms that were fully explained bythe coded registry diagnoses. This suggests that undiagnosed signs andsymptoms may be more common than is apparent from initial analyses ofregistry data. The most commonly reported symptoms in VA and DOD registries include fatigue, muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal complaints, headache, skinrashes, depression, neurologic and neurocognitive impairments, memoryloss, shortness of breath, and sleep disturbance. It is noteworthy thatveterans participate in the registry programs even though (1) participationin the programs is voluntary and some members of the active duty servicemay perceive it as career-limiting; (2) the health registry programs provideonly diagnostic services and treatment incidental to diagnosis (forexample, removal of malignancies found during a diagnostic biopsy); and(3) the examination can be lengthy. No Mechanisms Exist to Monitor Veterans'Quality of CareOfficials of both DOD and VA have testified that whatever uncertainties may exist about the cause of veterans' illnesses, the veterans are at leastreceiving appropriate and effective symptomatic treatment. 15 In the case of veterans with no clear diagnosis, treatment is based on symptoms, andveterans with multiple diagnoses may see multiple types of providers.However, these agencies had no mechanisms for monitoring the quality ofthese veterans' care or their clinical progress after their initialexamination, nor did they describe plans to establish such mechanisms. 16 VA delegates monitoring responsibilities to local veterans hospitals, which may monitor the quality of a subsample of services.17 15Testimony before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's Subcommittee on Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations by VA's Chief Public Health and EnvironmentalHazards Officer, December 11, 1996, and a written statement submitted by Dr. Stephen C. Joseph,Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to a September 25, 1996, joint hearing of the SenateSelect Intelligence and Veterans' Affairs Committees. 16Since November 1996, DOD has been working with independent contractors to determine appropriate health outcomes and other metrics that would characterize the current health status ofthose participating in the CCEP. In addition, a 5-year follow-up policy has been developed for the smallnumber of soldiers suspected of being exposed to depleted uranium particles. 17The term \"quality assurance\" is used to describe prospective processes or requirements\u2014such as licensure, inspections, or training\u2014generally intended to promote a certain level of performance basedon criteria that might be the subject of a quality measurement program (that is, indicators of theachievement of program goals or the capacity to achieve such goals). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 27 Appendix II No Systematic Approach for MonitoringVeterans' Treatment After InitialExamination VA officials involved in administering PGHREP told us that they regarded monitoring the clinical progress of registry participants as a separateresearch project, and DOD's CCEP manager made similar comments. Instead, the two agencies have relied on such quality assurance mechanisms asstandards for physician qualification and process measurements, althoughthese do not necessarily ensure a given level of effectiveness for the careprovided. 18 Although VA's Central Office samples a subset of all veterans having contact with VA hospitals to determine their satisfaction with VA health care, VA officials told us that this sample is not currently large enough to provide information specific to veterans of the Gulf War. Similarly, localfacilities may conduct studies of their success with a particular medicaltreatment (e.g., a coronary bypass), but these are unlikely to providespecific information on Gulf War veterans. 19 Efforts to Ensure Quality and MeasureSatisfaction WithInitial ExaminationAre Not AdequateBoth VA and DOD have applied some traditional quality assurance and measurement strategies to the initial examination of Gulf War veterans.20 In response to a recommendation of the IOM, DOD has asked for feedback from CCEP participants; however, we have found some problems with DOD's approach to analyzing Gulf War veterans' responses to questionnairesrelating to their satisfaction with CCEP evaluations. Specifically, (1) Gulf War veterans' responses were not compared to responses from other groups of patients seeking diagnosis and treatment. 18See Long-Term Care: Status of Quality Assurance and Measurement in Home and Community-Based Services (GAO/PEMD-94-19 , Mar. 1994). 19For previous GAO reviews of performance monitoring and outcomes measurement in VA and DOD health care programs, see Defense Health Care: New Managed Care Plan Progressing, but Cost and Performance Issues Remain (GAO/HEHS-96-128 ); VA Health Care: Trends in Malpractice Claims Can Aid in Addressing Quality of Care Problems (GAO/HEHS-96-24 ); VA Health Care: Physician Peer Review Identifies Quality of Care Problems, but Actions to Address Them Are Limited (GAO/HEHS-95-121 ); Veterans' Health Care: Veterans' Perceptions of VA Services and VA's Role in Health Care Reform (GAO/HEHS-95-14 ); VA Health Care for Women: In Need of Continued VA Attention (GAO/HEHS-94-114 ); and VA Health Care: VA Medical Centers Need to Improve Monitoring of High-Risk Patients (GAO/HRD-94-27 ). 20DOD identified the following quality assurance measures that are in place for all DOD eligible individuals: The National Quality Management Program, Clinical Quality Management Program for theMilitary Health Service System. The National Quality Management Program comprises the followingseven components: Medical Readiness, Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Licensure,Credentials and clinical Privileges, National Practitioner Data Bank, Utilization Management Oversight,and Special Studies. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 28 Appendix II No Systematic Approach for MonitoringVeterans' Treatment After InitialExamination (2) DOD combined into a single category the \"no opinion\" and missing responses. (3) It is unclear to what extent responses were included from patients who voluntarily declined participation in the program or were placed in an\"administrative declination\" category for \"failure to become activelyinvolved in the CCEP program.\" In addition, no information is available on the extent to which active duty veterans have sought evaluations outside the CCEP program, which could be an indicator of patient dissatisfaction. VA plans to initiate a satisfaction measure for its PGHREP by incorporating a feedback postcard in the examination process. However, this plan has been under development formonths, and VA officials told us it remained so as of March 24, 1997. Both VA and DOD have applied some quality measurement to their registry examination processes. A VA directive requires VA medical centers to use the PGHREP Quality Management/Self-Assessment Monitor to review at least a 10-percent sample of all Persian Gulf registry physical examinationsconducted from January 1, 1996, through September 30, 1996. The resultsof this process were submitted to VA's Environmental Agents Service and summarized for 167 of the VA's 173 medical centers. They showed a fairly high self-reported compliance with various aspects of the examinationamong reporting facilities. Although the results of this self-assessmentprocess suggested that the overwhelming majority of veterans who weresymptomatic at the time of the examination had a follow-up examinationscheduled, 20 percent were not assigned to a primary care team, and17 percent of their records lacked evidence of a follow-up letter containingexamination results and recommendations. Similarly, DOD tracks the aging of requests for CCEP examinations and provides feedback to its regional facilities on examinations that areoverdue or reports that remain incomplete. DOD does not consider an examination complete until certain fields in the examination report havebeen filled in and submitted. Through supervisory personnel at 13 regionaltreatment centers, DOD also conducts some oversight of examination activities at its 148 CCEP administration sites. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 29 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf War Illnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach The approach to collecting data on Persian Gulf veterans and the factors that might have caused their health problems has not been proactive, andarticulation of a research agenda came years after the war. The subsequentresearch, which is largely epidemiological and still ongoing, has pursuedsome hypotheses more aggressively than others and faces formidablemethodological problems. Goals of the EpidemiologicalResearchPresident Clinton established PGVCB on January 21, 1994, to coordinate federal efforts to address health concerns raised by veterans of the PersianGulf War. Various federal agencies had previously independentlyaddressed these concerns. The Research Working Group (RWG) of the PGVCB has primary responsibility for managing research into Gulf War illnesses. In August 1995, PGVCB identified three broad goals for research on veterans' illnesses: (1) determine the nature and prevalence ofsymptoms, illnesses, and unexplained conditions among Persian Gulfveterans; (2) identify possible causes for any illnesses found amongPersian Gulf veterans; and (3) identify diagnostic tools, treatmentmethods, and prevention strategies for illnesses found among Persian Gulfveterans. These are generally accepted goals for the epidemiologic studyof poorly understood conditions. To support these research goals, PGVCB identified 21 more specific research objectives. (See table III.1.) Table III.1: Research Objectives Identified by PGVCB Number Objective 1 What is the prevalence of symptoms/illnesses in the Gulf War veterans' population? How does this prevalence compare to that in an appropriatecontrol group? 2 What was the overall exposure of troops to leishmania tropica? 3 What were the exposure concentrations to various petroleum productsand their combustion products in typical usage during the Gulf War? 4 What was the extent of exposure to specific occupational/environmentalhazards known to be common in the Gulf War veterans' experience?Was this exposure different from that of an appropriate control group? 5aWhat were the potential exposures of troops to organophosphate nerveagents and/or sulfur mustard as a result of allied bombing atMuhammadiyat and Al Muthanna or the demolition of a weapons bunkerat Khamisiyah? 6aWhat was the extent of exposure to chemical agents, other than atKhamisiyah in the Gulf War as a function of space and time? 7 What was the prevalence of pyridostigmine bromide use among GulfWar troops? (continued) GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 30 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach Number Objective 8 What was the prevalence of various psychophysiological stressors among Gulf War veterans? Is the prevalence different from that of anappropriate comparison population? 9 Are Gulf War veterans more likely than an appropriate comparison groupto experience nonspecific symptoms and symptom-complexes? 10 Do Gulf War veterans have a greater prevalence of altered immunefunction or host defense when compared with an appropriate controlgroup? 11 Is there a greater prevalence of birth defects in the offspring of Gulf Warveterans than in an appropriate control population? 12 Have Gulf War veterans experienced lower reproductive success thanan appropriate control population? 13 Is the prevalence of sexual dysfunction greater among Gulf War veteransthan among an appropriate comparison population? 14 Do Gulf War veterans report more pulmonary symptoms or diagnosesthan persons in an appropriate control population? 15 Do Gulf War veterans have a smaller baseline lung function incomparison to an appropriate control group? Do Gulf War veterans havea greater degree of nonspecific airway reactivity in comparison to anappropriate control group? 16 Is there a greater prevalence of organic neuropsychological andneurological deficits in Gulf War veterans compared to appropriatecontrol 17 Can short-term, low-level incombination, cause short-term and/or long-term neurological effects? 18 Do Gulf War veterans have a significantly higher prevalence ofpsychological symptoms and/or diagnoses than do members of anappropriate control group? 19 What is the prevalence of leishmaniasis and other infectious diseases inthe Gulf War veteran population? 20 Do Gulf War veterans have a greater risk of developing cancers of anytype when compared with an appropriate control population? 21 Are Gulf War veterans experiencing a mortality rate that is greater thanthat of an appropriate control population? Are specific causes of deathrelated to service in the Persian Gulf? aObjective was added in 1996, following DOD's announcement of potential exposures to chemical warfare agents in postwar operations at three sites. In connection with these research objectives, 91 specific studies were identified in the most recent annual report to Congress on federally GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 31 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach sponsored research on Gulf War veterans' illnesses.21 (See table III.2.) According to figures reported by the agencies, through fiscal year 1996, DOD expended $19.9 million on these research efforts, VA spent $11.6 million, and HHS attributes expenditures of $5.5 million to the four projects it has pursued. In all, these agencies spent about $37 million forresearch through fiscal year 1996. Additional amounts have been madeavailable for ongoing and future projects.

The cost incurred for this work was$33,000. cFederal costs only. Federal Research Was Delayed and Lacked aProactive ApproachThe vast majority of federal research was initiated during or after 1994, and relatively few of these studies have been completed. Seventy-twoprojects (79 percent) were ongoing when we reviewed them in early 1997.Figure III.1, which shows the proportion of completed studies, is based onthe rate of progress toward completion of projects based on actual andprojected completion dates provided in the most recent research workingplan. In some instances, the projected completion dates have not beenmet. Therefore, figure III.1 slightly overstates the number of projectsactually completed. In fact, 28 studies have estimated completion datesprior to 1997, yet only 19 have been flagged as complete in the most recent(April 1997) report to Congress.

Source: GAO analysis of information published by the PGVCB. Many federal research efforts were started in association with legislation enacted by Congress. For example, legislation enacted in December 1991required DOD to establish a registry of troop members who were exposed to fumes from oil well fires and to report annually on its studies of thehealth effects of such exposure. Legislation enacted in late 1993 GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 38 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach authorized DOD to make grants for studies on the effects of veterans' exposure to low levels of hazardous chemicals, including chemicalwarfare agents, and on the effects of exposure to depleted uranium. In1994, Congress required DOD, in consultation with the VA and HHS, to conduct studies and administer grants for studies to determine the natureand causes of Gulf War illness, including, among others, studies todetermine the effects of exposure to pyridostigmine bromide. In 1996,Congress directed DOD to provide for research into the possible exposure of troops to chemical warfare agents or other hazardous materials and theuse by DOD of combinations of various vaccines and investigational new drugs. As noted by external reviewers, since federal research goals and objectives were not identified until 1995, after most research activities hadbeen initiated, they appear to reflect a rationalization of ongoing activityrather than a research management strategy. In March 1995, theDepartment of Veterans Affairs issued a report to Congress, entitledFederal Activities Related to the Health of Persian Gulf Veterans , that identified most of the projects now covered by the PGVCB 's research agenda but noted that \"this is a list of activities and is not intended to beconstrued as a comprehensive research strategy.\" Five months later, PGVCB issued A Working Plan for Research on Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses , which linked the previously identified projects to 19 specific researchobjectives. VA officials acknowledged that the research strategy was articulated in response to criticism from the IOM, which had said that \" VA and DOD should determine the specific research questions that need to be answered.\" Table III.3 documents other events coincident with changes inresearch activity.

Even efforts to measure the chemicalcontent of the oil-fire smoke, begun only 3 months after the fires beganburning, were initiated after most troops had left the affected areas andthe climatological dynamics may have been different. Consequently,researchers were forced to use statistical models of the behavior of smokeplumes in order to infer the ground-level exposures experienced by the GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 41 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach large numbers of troops who had departed by the time they began collecting data. Even if such models accurately explain the behavior of thesmoke plumes, they have not been validated as measures of individualexposure, and their accuracy for this purpose cannot be presumed. Similarand even more serious problems were caused in the measurement of otherexposures by the failure to collect data promptly and maintain adequaterecords. 22 The delay in starting research has also hindered accurate reporting ofexposures by Gulf War veterans. Questionnaires are being distributedtoday (6 years after the war ended) requesting information from veteranson their exposure to certain agents during Operation Desert Storm.Regarding one study, the IOM concluded, \"This is a well-designed and well-intended study, but it has started at least several years too late. Recallproblems and the inability to obtain accurate information on those whodied before the study started are major threats to its validity.\" ( IOM, Final Report , 1996, p. 91) Some Hypotheses Received EarlyEmphasisEarly federal research appeared to emphasize risks associated with psychological factors such as stress. To support this emphasis, DOD pointed out that the psychological state of mind can influence physicalwell-being. DOD also pointed to a recent argument that from the American Civil War onward (and perhaps even earlier), a small number of veteranshave reacted to the stress of war by suffering symptoms similar to thosereported by some Gulf War veterans. 23 Of the 19 studies initiated before 1994, roughly half focused on exposureto stress or the potential for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) among returning troops.24 As late as December 1996, the Presidential Advisory Committee ( PAC) on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses noted that 25 studies centered on stress or PTSD . However, some early research reflected immediate postwar concerns about other issues, for example, the potentialeffects of the oil fires set by Iraqi troops departing Kuwait and an unusualform of parasitic infection that had been identified in a small number ofpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center ( WRAMC ). 22See Defense Health Care: Medical Surveillance Has Improved Since the Gulf War, but Results in Bosnia Are Mixed (GAO/NSIAD-97-136 , May 13, 1997) and Institute of Medicine, Final Report , p. 5. 23K. C. Hyams et al., \"War Syndromes and Their Evaluation: From the U.S. Civil War to the Persian Gulf War,\" Annals of Internal Medicine , vol. 125 (1996), pp. 398-405. 24An additional 3 of the 19 studies did not provide information about veterans' illnesses but were instead building databases or methods to be used in later studies. Notably, according to the PGVCB,none of these 3 studies has yet been completed. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 42 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach Some Hypotheses Were Not InitiallyPursuedWhile research on exposure to stress received early emphasis, other hypotheses received scant support. In its Final Report , IOM discusses the evidence for a number of disease hypotheses, including multiple chemicalsensitivity and organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy ( OPIDN ). IOM found the evidence for none of the hypotheses to be highly compellingwhen it conducted the review, but it nevertheless highlighted theimportance of exploring \"all possible avenues to increase our knowledgeof such illnesses and to reduce suffering and disability.\" Nonetheless, asidefrom studies examining stress-related symptoms, relatively few studieshave been supported to evaluate alternative disease hypotheses. Forexample, prior to October 1996, only one study focused on the healtheffects of potential exposure to chemical warfare agents. 25 While multiple studies of the role of stress in the veterans' illnesses have been supportedwith federal research dollars, some other hypotheses have been pursuedlargely outside the federal research program. Although veterans raised concerns about potential chemical exposures soon after the war, and DOD had acknowledged one soldier's accidental exposure to a mustard agent in 1994, the federal research plan was notmodified to include an investigation of concerns about such agents until1996, when DOD acknowledged potential exposures to chemical agents at Khamisiyah, Iraq. The failure to fund such research cannot be traced to anabsence of investigator-initiated submissions. According to DOD officials, three recently funded proposals on low-level chemical exposure hadpreviously been denied funds. 26 (See DOD studies 49, 50, and 51 in table III.2) Additional Hypotheses WerePursued in the PrivateSectorA substantial body of privately funded research suggests that low-level exposure to certain chemical warfare agents or chemically relatedcompounds, such as certain pesticides, is associated with delayed orlong-term health effects. Regarding delayed health effects oforganophosphates, the chemical family used in many pesticides andchemical warfare agents, there is evidence from animal experiments,studies of accidental human exposures, and epidemiological studies ofhumans that low-level exposures to certain organophosphorus 25This study of the impacts of sulfur mustard agent is a collaborative effort between the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Oregon Health Sciences University. The principal investigatorfor the study pointed out that the possibility of chemical warfare exposure seemed plausible even in1994 when he sought initial funding for this research. 26The three previously unfunded proposals address central nervous system targets for organophosphates, development of a DNA-based method for assessing mustard agent exposure, andwork on the pharmacokinetics of the nerve agent VX. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 43 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach compounds, including sarin nerve agents to which some of our troops may have been exposed, can cause delayed, chronic neurotoxic effects.27 This syndrome is characterized by clinical signs and symptoms manifested 4 to21 days after exposure to organophosphate compounds. The symptoms ofdelayed neurotoxicity can take at least two forms: (1) a single large dosemay cause nerve damage with paralysis and later spastic movement, or(2) repetitive low doses may damage the brain, causing impairedconcentration and memory, depression, fatigue, and irritability. Thesedelayed symptoms may be permanent. As early as the 1950s, studies demonstrated that repeated oral and subcutaneous exposures to neurotoxic organophosphates produceddelayed neurotoxic effects in rats and mice. In addition, German personnelwho were exposed to nerve agents during World War II displayed signsand symptoms of neurological problems even 5 to 10 years after their lastexposure. Long-term abnormal neurological and psychiatric symptoms aswell as disturbed brain wave patterns have also been seen in workersexposed to sarin in sarin manufacturing plants. 28 The same abnormal brain wave disturbances were produced experimentally in primates by exposingthem to low doses of sarin. 29 Delayed, chronic neurotoxic effects were also seen in animal experimentsafter the administration of organophosphate. 30 These effects include difficulty in walking and paralysis. In recent experiments, animals given alow dosage of the nerve agent sarin for 10 days showed no signs ofimmediate illness but developed delayed chronic neurotoxicity after 2weeks. 31 27Sarin has been used as a chemical warfare agent since World War II, most recently during the Iran-Iraq war, and by terrorists in Japan. 28F.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 44 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach It has been suggested that the ill-defined symptoms experienced by Gulf War veterans may be due in part to OPIDN .32 This hypothesis was tested in a privately supported epidemiological study of Gulf War veterans.33 In addition to clarifying the patterns among veterans' symptoms by use ofstatistical factor analysis, this study demonstrated that vague symptoms ofthe ill veterans are associated with objective brain and nerve damagecompatible with the known chronic effects of exposures to low levels oforganophosphates. 34 It further linked the veterans' illnesses to exposure to combinations of chemicals, including nerve agents, pesticides in fleacollars, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide ( Toxicological research indicates that agents like pyridostigmine bromide, which Gulf War veterans took to protect themselves against theimmediate, life-threatening effects of nerve agents, may alter themetabolism of organophosphates in ways that activate their delayed,chronic effects on the brain. 35 Moreover, exposure to combinations of organophosphates and related chemicals like pyridostigmine bromide or DEET has been shown in animal studies to be far more likely to cause morbidity and mortality than any of the chemicals acting alone.36 32R.

Theremaining 30 studies are classified as basic (20 percent), applied(10 percent), and clinical (3 percent) research.

Results of our interviews with principal investigators of ongoing epidemiological projectsare generally consistent with this distribution; none of the investigators weinterviewed identified the primary goal of his work as developingtreatment strategies.

Source: GAO analysis of information provided by PGVCB. Descriptive studies are useful for providing information about an illness. But the principal value of doing descriptive studies is to aid in generatinghypotheses that, through careful analytical studies, can lead to isolatingthe nature of the illness and developing treatments. Because so little wasinitially known about Gulf War veterans' health, there was a need fordescriptive studies. Most of the epidemiological studies thus far havefocused on descriptive studies of prevalence. With the exception of thestudies that explore the hypothesis that combat stress explains a portionof Gulf War veterans' symptoms, research has, by and large, been stuck atthe beginning of the study cycle presented in appendix I, perhaps partly asa result of a failure to identify hypotheses for further testing, the absenceof exposure data, and a failure to identify one or more case definitions. If research on treatments must follow the descriptions of illnesses and causes provided through epidemiological research, then improvedtreatments for the illnesses afflicting Gulf War veterans might never befound. In 1994, Congress directed DOD and VA to research treatments for ailing Gulf War veterans. Our report shows that such research has largelynot taken place, even though more focused research can be done withouthaving first answered general descriptive questions. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 47 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach Formidable MethodologicalProblemsOur review indicated that most of the ongoing epidemiological studies focusing on the prevalence or causes of Gulf War-related illnesses havebeen hampered by data problems and methodological limitations andconsequently may not be able to provide conclusive answers in responseto their stated objectives, particularly in identifying risk factors orpotential causes. Problems With Prevalence StudiesAll but one of the research objectives identified by PGVCB (as noted earlier in table III.1) concern establishing the prevalence of symptoms, exposures,morbidity, or mortality. In fact, the PGVCB research plan states that \"the most important question about the health of Persian Gulf veterans is: ArePersian Gulf veterans experiencing a greater prevalence of symptoms andillnesses in comparison with an appropriate control population?\" Theresearch plan suggests that the direction of additional exploration iscontingent on the answer to this question (for example, greater prioritywill be given to investigating excess health outcomes). It should be noted that Gulf War veterans, even in theater, may have experienced broadly different sets of circumstances and exposures. Forexample, according to press reports, none of the French troops havecomplained of similar illnesses. Some notable differences were thatFrench forces were not in the same places as the other allied forces; theFrench camps were not sprayed with insecticides; and the French did notvaccinate against anthrax, take preventive measures against botulinumtoxin, or administer pyridostigmine bromide. None of the federally fundedstudies used French troops as a comparison group. In contrast, most of theongoing studies designed to assess the prevalence of various conditions ofGulf War veterans and others were making broad comparisons betweendeployed and nondeployed veterans, rather than specific types and levelsof exposures. For example, our interviews found that 12 of 13 ongoingcohort studies had defined the exposed cohort with reference to nothingmore than deployment status. That is, in almost all cases, the exposure ofinterest was defined simply as \"Gulf War service,\" and the prevalence ofsymptoms or illnesses among Gulf War veterans is being compared to theprevalence of symptoms or illnesses among troops who were not deployedto the Gulf. Such comparisons may have value for providing basic assurances to veterans regarding widespread and severe health consequences of GulfWar service. However, many service-connected illnesses could beobscured by broad comparisons of deployed and nondeployed veterans GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 48 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach without regard to their specific exposure histories. At the same time, illnesses that were not actually service connected could appear to belinked to deployment status due to preexisting group differences. Forexample, some troops were not deployed for health reasons, potentiallybiasing the comparison group in the direction of greater illness. Also, dueto the failure to compare the prewar health of the groups, the absence ofdifferences is no assurance that one of the groups has not experienced asignificantly steeper decline in health. Some investigators have attempted to address some of the problems of systematic differences between deployed and nondeployed veterans bycomparing Gulf War veterans to servicemembers who were deployed tolocations other than the Gulf. To the extent that such group differencesare measured, they can also be statistically controlled. While these arepotentially promising solutions, such comparisons must still be carefullyevaluated in the absence of evidence of prior similarity between thegroups and greater specificity regarding exposure. Problems With Studies of Risk Factors or Causes ofIllnessAs we noted earlier, to ascertain the causes of illnesses, it is imperative that investigators have valid and reliable methods to collect informationon exposures as well as their effects. The need for accurate, dose-specificinformation is particularly critical for low-level or intermittent exposure(s)to drugs, chemicals, or biological agents. In addition, the investigatorsmust specify diagnostic criteria to (1) reliably determine who has thedisease or condition being studied and who does not and (2) selectappropriate controls (people who do not have the disease or condition).To the extent that individuals are misclassified regarding disease orexposure, conclusions would be misleading and relationships would beobscured. Measurement of Exposure Is ProblematicThe research program to answer basic questions about the illnesses that afflict Gulf War veterans has at least three major problems in linkingexposures to observed illness or symptoms. First, it is extremely difficultto gather information about the unplanned exposures (for example, oil-firesmoke and insects) that may have occurred in the Gulf, and DOD has acknowledged that records of planned or intentional exposures (forexample, the use of vaccines and pyridostigmine bromide to protectagainst chemical/biological warfare agents) were inadequate. Second, theveterans were typically exposed to a wide array of agents with commonlyaccepted health effects, making it difficult to isolate and characterize theeffects of individual factors or study their combined effects. Third, the GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 49 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach passage of time following these exposures has made it increasingly difficult to have confidence in any information gathered throughretrospective questioning of veterans. 37 In part, the latter difficulty was created by the delayed release ofinformation about detection of chemical warfare agents during the war aswell as the delayed collection of exposure data. Five years passed before itwas acknowledged that American soldiers may have been exposed tochemical warfare agents shortly after the war ended in 1991 (at theKhamisiyah site). Moreover, although chemical detections by Czech forceshave been deemed \"credible\" by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA), the source of these detections remains unknown. In the face of denials by DOD officials, a few researchers told us that they had considered it pointless topursue hypotheses that the symptoms may have been associated withexposure to chemical weapons. When we asked investigators responsible for ongoing federally funded epidemiological projects about how they were collecting data on thevarious factors to which Gulf War veterans may have been exposed, wefound that most projects had no means other than self-reports formeasuring most of the factors to which troops may have been exposed.(See table III.6.) This reliance on self-reports was present even forexposures such as vaccines for which records might have existed. 37Large numbers of veterans questioned during their participation in the VA's revised health registry examination program reported they did not know whether they were exposed to certain agents. \"Don'tknow\" responses were greatest for nerve gas (64.9 percent), mustard gas (60.2 percent), depleteduranium (52.5 percent), chemical-agent resistant coating (47.8 percent), microwaves (32.8 percent),paints or solvents (24.9 percent), and pyridostigmine (21.1 percent). To the extent that a response ofsome kind reflects greater certainty, veterans were more confident in their reports regarding smokefrom tent heaters, passive smoking, diesel or other petrochemical fumes, skin exposure to fuel,pesticides in cream or spray form, and burning trash or feces, each of which resulted in fewer than11 percent of respondents reporting \"don't know.\" However, the provision of a response does notnecessarily connote that the reports are accurate.

Of these, 22 indicated they werecollecting exposure information. aAmong the 22 collecting any exposure data. bAmong those collecting data on the exposure named in the first column. Source: GAO's survey of investigators charged with ongoing epidemiological studies. There are three problems associated with reliance on self-reports for exposure assessments. First, recalled information may be inaccurate aftersuch a long time period; that is, some veterans may not remember thatthey were exposed to particular factors, while others may not have beenexposed but nonetheless inaccurately report that they were. Second,recollections also may be biased if, for example, veterans who becamesick following the war recall their exposures earlier, more often, ordifferently than veterans who did not become sick. Third, there is often nostraightforward way to test the validity of self-reported exposureinformation, making it impossible to separate biased recollections fromactual differences in exposure frequency. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 51 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach Some investigators are also relying on a model developed by the U. S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency for assessing exposures tocomponents of oil-fire smoke through the combination of unit locationdata and information from models of the distribution of oil-fire smoke.However, this method requires the use of unit location as a proxy forexposure, and the validity of this approach is unknown. As PAC noted, DOD's Persian Gulf Registry of Unit Locations \"lacks the precision and detail necessary to be an effective tool for the investigation of exposureincidents.\" (See PAC's Final Report (Washington, D.C.: GPO), p. 35.) Case Definition Is Complicated by Presence of NonspecificSymptomsAnother major hurdle to the development of a successful research agenda has been the difficulty in classifying symptoms into one or more distinctillnesses. Some veterans complain of gastrointestinal pain, others reportmusculoskeletal pain or weakness, and still others report emotional orneurological symptoms. As explained previously, a specific case definitionis essential to conducting certain types of epidemiological studies. Although some data on symptoms were collected beginning in 1992 with the initiation of the VA registry, initial efforts to collect information about symptoms and exposures from registry participants were limited andnonspecific, constraining their potential use for improving understandingof the patterns of veterans' complaints. The limitations in early registrydata are unfortunate insofar as detailed information about symptoms andexposures might have yielded earlier, more reliable analyses of the natureand causes of veterans' complaints that could have also assisted in arrivingat working case definition(s). Furthermore, clinical effects of a transitorynature that may have been manifested soon after the war would have beenmissed due to delays in setting up and developing studies and registries. We also found that both the federally supported projects and the federal registry programs have generally failed to study the conjunction ofmultiple symptoms in individual veterans. Articles and briefing documentsthat we have obtained report findings that address the incidence of singlesymptoms and diagnoses. There are two exceptions. First, the Center forDisease Control ( CDC) and Prevention developed an operational case definition, which is quite similar to the case definition of chronic fatiguesyndrome. Obviously, this definition cannot be generalized beyond thepopulation from which it was derived. Second, the studies conducted byHaley et al. also focused on identifying symptom clusters. For those ongoing epidemiological projects that are built on case-control designs, we inquired about how a case was defined. The specificity of this GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 52 Appendix III Federal Strategy to Research Gulf WarIllnesses Lacks a Coherent Approach definition is important because a vague case definition can lead to considering multiple kinds of illness together. When this is done, it is notsurprising to find no commonality of experience among the cases.Moreover, the use of specific case definition is particularly critical toachieving meaningful results within this type of research design. However,in the ongoing studies we surveyed, case definition was quite broad, evenamong studies that depended upon case-control research designs. Forexample, among 13 case-control or nested case-control studies, casedefinitions included such broad descriptors as registry participants, GulfWar veterans who are symptomatic without diagnosable illness, andveterans with complaints of chronic fatigue and muscle weakness. Sample Size Most investigators we interviewed in our survey took steps to estimate thesize of sample they would require to have a reasonable expectation ofdetecting differences between deployed and nondeployed veterans orexposures to hazardous substances. However, many variables are involvedin such calculations, for example, the size of the investigated exposure'sexpected impact on health (consistent lethal effects can be detected in asmaller sample than more subtle problems) and the prevalence ofexposure, some of which were unknown at the time the studies wereplanned. Thus, they had to be estimated within somewhat broadparameters. Although steps were clearly taken to plan for an adequatesample size, some investigators reported difficulty in locating subjects dueto factors beyond their control, such as the rate of referrals from VA examination centers or the rate of identification of subjects that fit highlyspecific case definitions. Moreover, other studies, such as those onspecific birth defects, require extremely large samples. An investigator ona principal study of birth defects indicated that the number of births toGulf War veterans and problems with data collection would mean thatdata would not be sufficient to draw conclusions about a particular defect(Goldenhaar syndrome) for 6 years or more. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 53 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions Is Weak or Subject to Different Interpretations A key measure of the effectiveness of a research program is the extent to which it has yielded verifiable conclusions regarding the subject of study.We previously reviewed findings contained in the November 1996 revisionof A Working Plan for Research on Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses and concluded that PGVCB had formed few strong conclusions based on the research that it had sponsored and coordinated. To gauge the extent ofknowledge about Gulf War illnesses, we also reviewed other recentdocuments and spoke to VA and DOD officials to determine what would represent the best statement of conclusions. This review indicated that themost extensive and detailed review of the evidence about Gulf Warillnesses was done by the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf WarVeterans' Illnesses. The 12-member Committee held 18 public meetingsbetween August 1995 and November 1996 before reaching its conclusions.In its final report, PAC presents its conclusions about the likelihood that 10 commonly cited exposure agents have contributed to the explained andunexplained illnesses being suffered by Gulf War veterans. (See tableIV.1.) The PAC report was reviewed by DOD, which endorsed many of the findings.38 Table IV.1: PAC Conclusions on Health Effects of Different Individual Exposure Agents Exposure agent PAC's conclusion Reasons Our assessment Biological warfare agents\"It is unlikely the health effectsreported today by Gulf Warveterans are the result ofexposures to biological warfareagents\"\"There were no verified detectionsof anthrax or botulinum toxin duringthe war. Second, statesideexamination of soil samples andenzyme assays did not reveal thepresence of BW agents.\"We have noted the limitations of theU.S. detection capability forbiological warfare agents. Weagree with PAC that the effects ofat least one of the agents that Iraqweaponized might not be observedfor many years. (continued) 38In endorsing PAC's conclusion that it is \"unlikely\" that the symptoms and diseases are due to exposure to agents during the Gulf War, DOD also noted that \"there may still be small groups of GulfWar veterans that may have illnesses related to exposures during the Gulf War [and that DOD] willcontinue...our clinical investigation and research efforts.\" According to PAC, VA, HHS, veterans'service organizations, and individual veterans and veterans' advocates also reviewed its report.However, PAC did not provide information on the extent to which these reviewers agreed with itsfindings, or whether it incorporated their comments in its reports. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 54 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions IsWeak or Subject to Different Interpretations Exposure agent PAC's conclusion Reasons Our assessment Chemical warfare agents\"It is unlikely the health effectsreported by Gulf War veteranstoday are the result of exposure toOP or mustard chemical warfareagents during the Gulf War.\"\"Available scientific evidence doesnot indicate that such long-termeffects occur in humans followinglow-level exposures, but theamount of data from either humanor animal research on low-levelexposures is minimal.\"We dispute this conclusion. Thereis evidence from various sourcesthat chemical weapons werereleased at Khamisyah andelsewhere on the battlefield. Someevidence from animal andepidemiological studies documentsthe potential for delayed or chroniceffects from such exposure. Thus,we cannot exclude the possibilitythat such health effects couldimpact exposed veterans. Depleted uranium \"It is unlikely that health effectsreported by Gulf War veteranstoday are the result of exposure todepleted uranium during the GulfWar.\"\"Toxic effects are likely to be similarto the kidney toxicity observed frominhaled or ingested uranium. Todate, VA has reported no kidneytoxicity among soldiers woundedby DU fragments in friendly fireepisodes.\"We have no comment on this issue.a Infectious diseases \"It is unlikely that infectiousdiseases endemic to the Gulfregion are responsible for longterm health effects in Gulf Warveterans, except in a small, knownnumber of individuals.\"\"While viscerotropic leishmaniasiscan be difficult to confirm, it is notconsidered to be a cause ofwidespread illness in Gulf Warveterans. All veterans diagnosedwith viscerotropic leishmaniasis,except one, have experienced thesigns characteristic of the disease . From August 1990 through July1991, the U.S. Army deployedapproximately 347,000 individualsto the Gulf region. Based oninformation from U.S. Army fieldhospitals, the only infectiousdiseases that caused 30 or moreeach of approximately 14,000admissions were pneumonia,intestinal infections, inflammation ofthe testes and/or epididymus,chicken pox, and kidney infections.\"Owing to the invasive character ofcurrent screening tests forviscerotropic leishmaniasis it hasbeen impossible to test broadly forinfection. Although some sourceshave suggested that the rate ofleishmania infection may be ashigh as 5% of certain groupsdeployed to the Persian Gulf, thereis currently no means of screeningfor asymptomatic infections whichcan re-emerge during immunesystem failure. The Center forDisease Control and Preventionhas found evidence of previous Qfever and sandfly fever infection ina subsample of Gulf War would indicate exposure tothe sandfly that caries leishmania. Oil-well fire smoke \"It is unlikely exposure to oil-wellfire smoke is responsible forsymptoms reported today by GulfWar veterans.\"\"Toxic gases that can be found inoil-well fire smoke-such sulfide and sulfurdioxide-can cause eye and decreased pulmonaryfunction, and increased airwayreactivity.

Petroleum products \"It is unlikely that health effectsreported today by Gulf Warveterans are due to exposure topetroleum products during the war.\"We have no comment on this issue.a Psychological andphysiological stress \"Stress is likely to be an importantcontributing factor to the broadrange of illnesses currently beingreported by Gulf War veterans.\"\"The entire federal researchportfolio should place greateremphasis on basic and appliedresearch on the physiologic effectsof stress and stress-relateddisorders.\"\"Animal studies demonstrate thatstress can have measurable effectson the brain, immune system,cardiovascular system, and varioushormonal responses. Although thehuman body can adapt to normalstresses, if the stress lasts longer itcan be expressed in a variety ofphysical illness symptoms. Someresearchers suspect that theinadequate production of stresshormones and stress responseoccurs in some (not all) humanswith chronic fatigue syndrome andpost-traumatic stress disorder.Based on this understanding andsupported by decades of clinicalobservations, physicians recognizethat many physical, as well aspsychological, diagnoses are theconsequences of stress.\"Although the evidence that wereviewed indicates that stress canhave an important role in symptomsof many physical illnesses, whenstress is present in a patient withuntreated and undiagnosed diffusephysical symptoms, care must betaken to determine whether thestress is the cause or the effect ofthe physical symptoms. We foundweak support for the conclusionthat stress is an importantcontributing factor in the broadrange of illnesses being reportedby Gulf War veterans; most of theevidence cited by PAC addressedthe effects of stress solely on PTSD.

Ongoing federally funded studiesshould help the scientificcommunity draw conclusions aboutthe synergistic effects of PB andother risk factors.\"PB is used in much higher doses inpatients with myasthenia gravisthan was administered to militarypersonnel.Experiments in animal models(including one study sponsored byDOD) show that PB has toxiceffects in combination with otherelements, such as DEET andpermethrin, in the Gulf Warenvironment. This may beparticularly true for animals with agenetic predisposition. Cases ofsuch delayed neurotoxic effects inhumans exposed to PB and DEEThave been epidemiologicallyinferred and reproduced in hens.We note that PB was intended foruse only when other agents werebelieved to be present or imminent.PB remains classified as aninvestigational new drug for thepurposes for which it was used inthe Gulf War. Vaccines \"It is unlikely that health effectsreported by Gulf War veteranstoday are the result of exposures tothe BT or anthrax vaccines, usedalone or in combination.\"\"The human immune system hasevolved the capability to deal withthousands of foreign substances,to sort them out, and to regulateimmune response.

Individualvaccines can cause adverseeffects, but several studies of theeffects of giving multiplevaccinations at one time havefound no adverse effectsassociated with the practice.\"DOD has not adequately monitoredthe effects of receiving multiplevaccines. aThis does not mean that we believe that it is not a risk factor. Extent of Posttraumatic StressDisorder May BeOverestimatedPGVCB has stated that \"some symptoms may be related to PTSD . Published findings suggest an increased prevalence of PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses, such as depression in some Persian Gulf veterans....stressorsduring the Persian Gulf conflict were sufficient to cause significantpsychiatric morbidity.\" 39 In testimony before the House Appropriation Committee, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs hasstated that 39PGVCB, A Working Plan for Research on Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses (Nov. 1996), p. 36. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 57 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions IsWeak or Subject to Different Interpretations \"one of the most striking findings of our clinical work has been the recognition of psychological conditions and stress-related symptoms as a major diagnostic categoryamong veterans cared for in our facilities. Our clinicians have been impressed that stressexperienced during the Gulf War and in its aftermath appears to be a major contributingfactor in the development of psychological conditions as well as the manifestation ofsymptoms associated with non-psychological conditions.\" Similarly, PAC has stated that \"epidemiological studies to assess the effects of stress invariably have found higher rates of PTSD in Gulf War veterans than among individuals in nondeployed units or in the general U.S.population of the same age.\" 40 However, the studies to which PAC refers have not excluded other conditions that produce symptoms similar to PTSD and can also elevate scores on key measures of PTSD . Although the reported rates of PTSD in various studies range from 4 to 32 percent, these rates were based on widely different populations, with high rates ofnonparticipation, and little information on selection bias. Moreover, aswith most scales and tests, a certain number of people will test positive onany given measure of PTSD even though they do not have PTSD ; they may have a related disorder or no disorder at all. Based on the large numbers ofindividuals to whom these scales were administered, such false positivesmay be a significant portion of all those who obtained scores indicative of PTSD . In a CDC-sponsored study of Iowa veterans that achieved a 76-percent response rate and used a relatively inclusive criterion for identification ofpresumptive PTSD , observed rates were quite low, although they were higher among Gulf-deployed than nondeployed veterans.41 Only 15 percent of the diagnoses categorized as psychological (accordingto the International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision (ICD-9)) among CCEP registrants are clear cases of PTSD . Owing to the breadth and heterogeneity of ICD-9 categories used to report CCEP data, high percentages of primary or secondary \"psychological conditions\" arereported, but the most frequently diagnosed \"psychological condition\" wastension headache. Investigators from the Department of MilitaryPsychiatry at WRAMC reported, \"The major conclusion concerning physical health of these veterans is that for those who deployed to the Gulf War andcurrently report physical symptoms, neither stress nor exposure to combat 40PAC, Final Report (Dec. 1996), p. 79. 41Iowa Persian Gulf Study Group, \"Self-reported Illness and Health Status Among Gulf War Veterans: A Population Based Study,\" Journal of the American Medical Association , vol. 227 (1997), pp. 238-245.

For example, just following the war, experts from Walter ReedArmy Institute of Research ( WRAIR ) fever (phlebotomus fever)....has caused substantial epidemics in foreign military forces in the Middle East. It is an acute, self-limited viral disease with a course of two tofive days and an incubation period of less than one week, whose acute manifestations willbe unlikely in those who have returned from the region. Convalescence, however, isfrequently complicated by depression, fatigue, and weakness that can last months. Theevaluation of a chronic fatigue or post-traumatic stress-like syndrome in those who havereturned from the Persian Gulf should therefore include serologic testing to rule out anearlier sandfly fever virus infection.\" 43 Such serologic testing is available only from CDC, in Fort Collins, Colorado, and from U. S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease( USAMRIID ) in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Thus, it is unlikely that testing has been broadly done to assess veterans' fatigue symptoms. However, a CDC analysis of blood taken from 158 volunteer Pennsylvania Air NationalGuardsmen found that 5.7 percent showed evidence of previous sandflyfever infection. For various reasons, including false positives and theabsence of preexposure blood samples for comparison, such evidence canbe difficult to interpret but suggests the importance of reviewingalternative explanations for diagnoses of PTSD and chronic fatigue syndrome. Although widely cited work has argued that ill-defined syndromes have been observed following many previous military conflicts, it is difficult tocompare current and historical findings due to differences in thediagnostic capabilities previously available. 44 It is highly likely that these historical groups contained a mix of ailments that would now bedifferently diagnosed. Moreover, even if these postwar syndromescontained overlapping symptoms, it is not a foregone conclusion thatcommonalities reflect the common experience of stress. 42R. H.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 59 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions IsWeak or Subject to Different Interpretations Extent of AsymptomaticLeishmania InfectionIs UnknownPGVCB concluded that \"the likelihood of Leishmania tropica as an important risk factor for widely reported illness has diminished.\"45 While this is the case for observed symptomatic infection with the parasite, theprevalence of asymptomatic infection is unknown, and such infection mayreemerge in cases in which the patient's immune system becomesdeficient. Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by a microscopic parasite that invades certain types of white blood cells. While leishmaniasis occursin Southwest Asia and certain other parts of the world, it is very rarelyseen in the United States. The disease is transmitted by sandflies, and anumber of different leishmania species are known to infect humans.Personal protective methods are relatively less effective against sandfliesthan against mosquitoes. Sandfly populations were monitored during theGulf War and were found to be high from August to November 1990 andagain from April to June 1991. Forms of disease that involve low levels of parasite infection can be particularly difficult to diagnose using currently available methods.According to briefings we received by experts at WRAIR , accurate diagnosis of leishmaniasis is important because effective treatment involves the useof potentially toxic drugs currently being investigated as new drugs andnot yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They noted thatsuch diagnosis is problematic because most clinicians would fail to recognize classic forms of leishmaniasis,much less atypical clinical presentations; accurate laboratory diagnosis of suspected cases (detection of parasites inbiopsy or culture) is not available to most physicians; and blood tests can provide supportive evidence of infection but cannot beused alone to establish a diagnosis of leishmaniasis. While blood testing for leishmania infection is problematic, it is the only means currently available of assessing the potential prevalence of suchinfection. In testing blood collected since the war from 158 Air NationalGuardsmen, CDC researchers reported positive results for exposure to 45PGVCB, A Working Plan for Research on Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses (Nov. 1996), p. 20. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 60 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions IsWeak or Subject to Different Interpretations leishmania donovani in 4.9 percent and leishmania tropica in 4.3 percent.46 Most of these individuals were also among the 5.7 percent showing evidence of exposure to the sandfly vector that carries leishmania throughpositive results on a well-characterized test for sandfly fever. However, the CDC sample was composed of Air National Guardsmen who volunteered for a particular study and were deployed from the same area, so the testsdo not represent estimates of the prevalence of the infection for Gulf Warveterans at large. The study also found no clear association betweenresults for leishmania infection and the presence of a set of symptomscharacteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome. 47 Although PGVCB officials told us that the symptoms typical of leishmaniasis, including enlargement of the liver, were not being observed,not all ill veterans would show such symptoms. In commenting on a reporton a new form of leishmaniasis, CDC noted that five Gulf War veterans had been diagnosed with the infection, even though their symptoms werenonspecific, and none had the marked symptoms typical of visceralleishmaniasis. 48 Approval continues to be pursued for a skin test to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic infection. 46In 1991, tests were run on blood samples from 119 military working dogs that had been in Saudi Arabia. Five dogs (4.2 percent) were positive for the disease. One of these dogs subsequentlydeveloped the infection, which was confirmed by autopsy. Symptomatic disease and demonstratedinfection have been observed in individuals with serological titers of 1:16. While none of 50 Marinesshowed a result at this level before deployment, tests of 488 Desert Storm veterans conducted after thewar showed 5 percent had results of 1:32 or higher. Roughly 5 percent of a sample of troops testedafter the initial identification of viscerotropic leishmaniasis showed positive results using a skin testinvolving a slightly different parasite. However, few of those who tested positive were symptomatic,and the accuracy and appropriateness of the tests for this purpose is controversial. Finally, a Seattleorganization attempting to develop a test for viscerotropic leishmaniasis has reportedly found positiveresponses among asymptomatic subjects. WRAIR officials view this test as a highly specific indicatorof exposure to leishmania tropica, but not a specific indicator for the type of the parasite associatedwith viscerotropic infection. 47Based on concerns about the potential for transmission of this disease through the blood supply, blood donations were temporarily deferred for all Gulf War veterans returning from Southwest Asiasince August 1, 1990. The blood donation ban was lifted on January 1, 1993. However, an accurate andnoninvasive screening test for this form of leishmaniasis remains commercially unavailable. Althougha study of transfused animals has demonstrated that the parasite retains its infectivity under bloodbank conditions, in lifting the ban, DOD officials observed that there had been no documented case oftransfusion-acquired leishmania tropica. 48\"Viscerotropic Leishmaniasis in Persons MMWR , vol. 41, pp. 131-134.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 61 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions IsWeak or Subject to Different Interpretations Evidence of Exposure to Biological andChemical WeaponsHas Not BeenAggressively PursuedDOD has consistently denied that Gulf War veterans were intentionally or unintentionally exposed to biological warfare agents, and prior toJune 1996, it denied any exposure to chemical warfare agents. Ifservicemembers were exposed, exposure would have occurred in one ofthree ways: (1) through intentional Iraqi use of chemical or biologicalwarfare agents, (2) through theaterwide contamination resulting from airwar bombings of Iraq, or (3) through site-specific events. As has been pointed out by the Presidential Advisory Committee, the United States currently has no system that can detect and identifybiological warfare agent aerosols rapidly enough to enable troops to takeprotective measures. Regarding chemical warfare agents, while the UnitedStates has a detector/alarm system, according to DOD, it is not as sensitive as some other systems, such as those operated by Czechoslovakiancoalition partners. DOD has taken the position that chemical and biological agent exposures can be confirmed only through evidence of massincidents of morbidity and mortality. Since there were no such instances, DOD asserted that Gulf War veterans were not exposed. Biological Warfare Agents According to the CIA, the Presidential Advisory Committee, and others, the Iraqis had weaponized several biological agents at the time of the GulfWar, including Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum, and aflatoxin. 49 Apart from aflatoxin (a potent liver carcinogen), these agents are knownto have immediate and life-threatening toxic effects. Although the UnitedStates took steps to vaccinate troops against anthrax and botulism,according to PAC, \"after the war, new data revealed that Iraq had also weaponized aflatoxin.\" This agent's effects may not be observed untildecades after low-level exposure via ingestion, and the effects ofaerosolized aflatoxin are poorly understood. PAC notes that any effects (notably liver cancer) from exposure to aflatoxin would not be expecteduntil several years passed. PAC also recommended that DOD and VA monitor the Gulf War veteran population. PAC reviewed U.S. Army hospital admission records and identified only one admission for anthrax (a disease indigenous to the Gulf region) and nonefor botulism. In addition, although Navy and Army researchers tested over800 pairs of prewar and postwar blood samples from Navy Seabees forantibody to anthrax, they found no evidence of acute infections. Whilemany blood samples showed evidence of vaccine-induced immunity, only 49J. D. Walker, \"Biological Weapons: Attempts to Verify\" In Ranger, R. (Ed.) (1996). The Devil's Brews I: Chemical and Biological Weapons and Their Delivery Systems (Lancaster, UK: The Center for Defence and International Security Studies), pp. 36-8. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 62 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions IsWeak or Subject to Different Interpretations one showed evidence of exposure to the wild antigen or similar bacteria. PAC reported that other evidence it examined also failed to support the notion that biological weapons were used. The PAC report documents that Iraq had weaponized aflatoxin. In our discussions with agency officials, the potential use of aflatoxin wasdismissed because it would not immediately incapacitate coalition forcesand would therefore have no strategic value. Prior to the war, the UnitedStates told Iraq that any use of biological or chemical weapons oncoalition forces would have devastating consequences for Iraq. The UnitedStates did not deploy a real-time detection system for biological weapons. 50 Therefore, one cannot be certain that such weapons were not used,particularly since the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq ( UNSCOM ) has not been able to confirm Iraq's self-declared destruction of theseweapons. 51 Similarly, a USAMRIID official indicated that tests were not available to detect low-dose (i.e., asymptomatic) exposures to various biologicalagents that the Iraqis had weaponized. While biomarkers may be availablefor exposure to some of these agents, interpreting the results of suchtesting in the absence of symptoms is complex, and little such testingappears to have been done. Chemical Warfare Agents As with exposures to biological weapons, there were no massive incidentsof mortality or morbidity observed in theater that were consistent withknown acute effects of exposure to chemical warfare agents. The U.S.Army officer responsible for medical surveillance of chemical/biologicalwarfare agents during the war has testified to the PAC that only one accidental casualty was treated. However, it is important to note thatdetections of the nerve agent sarin occurred on January 19, 1991, and ofmustard gas on January 24, 1991, by coalition partners fromCzechoslovakia in areas near Hafir al Batin. DOD has verified the reliability 50The Army fielded the interim Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS) in September 1996. A total of 38 systems have been produced, with a total of 35 located collectively with the 310th ArmyReserve Chemical Company (Biological Detection) and the 20th BIDS Detachment (Active Army), atFt. McClellan, AL. The current BIDS can detect and identify up to four biological agents at a time in 45minutes. Future improvements are expected to enable BIDS to detect and identify more agents in lesstime.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 63 Appendix IV Support for Key Official Conclusions IsWeak or Subject to Different Interpretations of the Czech equipment but has never identified the source of these detections, although both DOD and CIA have deemed the detections credible. One cannot rule out the possibility that these detections were theresult of fallout from coalition bombings. During late January and February 1991, DOD records indicate that coalition forces successfully conducted a series of aerial bombings on suspectnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons storage and production sites. UNSCOM has not inspected all suspect and targeted sites. As a result, the magnitude of exposures to chemical warfare agents has not been fullyresolved. With regard to site-specific exposures identified at Khamisiyah, uncertainties surround the extent of potential exposure. A contractor for CIA had attempted to model the dispersion of chemical warfare agents. But the uncertainties were too great to complete the model. Theseuncertainties stem from (1) the lack of pertinent meteorological data;(2) gross uncertainties about the amount of chemical warfare materialpresent at the time of demolition; and (3) the behavior of the material ondemolition (e.g., vaporization or evaporation) in an open pit. Impact of DOD Denials on FederalResearchThe 1995 PGVCB research plan noted that investigations of chemical weapons effects were not done because there was no evidence ofexposure. 52 Noting that there had been no mass casualties to indicate chemical weapons exposure, DOD failed to fund research on the possible long-term health consequences of low-level exposure to chemical warfareagents. In fact, a few researchers told us that, as a result of DOD's strong position, they believed it would be fruitless to request funding for suchresearch. PGVCB reversed its position in its 1996 plan, following the revelations regarding Khamisiyah. A broad agency announcement seekingresearch on this issue was subsequently issued and some work has beencommissioned. Experts in the field of toxicology told us that had suchinformation been made available earlier, the direction and outcome ofresearch would have been different. 52We could not assess this statement, as relevant data were not available for us.

GAO Comments1. DOD offers selected excerpts from reports of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Presidential Advisory Committee ( PAC) that leave the impression the reports were uncritical of its actions, but this was not thecase. These reports point out multiple problems and contain numerousrecommendations for improvement. 2. The national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 requested that we conduct an independent and objective review of federal clinicalcare and medical research efforts into Gulf War illnesses. That directiveincluded gathering and analyzing information and coming to our ownconclusions on the matters under review. Our information sourcesincluded previous reports, such as those by the IOM Committee to Review the Health Consequences of Service During the Persian Gulf War and thePresidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses.However, the conclusions presented in our report are ours, and not thoseof other bodies. DOD's assertion that our assessment was somehow less careful or thoughtful than those provided by the PAC and IOM is groundless. 3. DOD's comments do not address our specific finding that it has no information on whether Gulf War veterans are any better or worse todaythan when they were initially diagnosed. DOD suggests that its current approach provides adequate oversight for Gulf War veterans' care but thenindicates that it is reviewing a draft proposal on health outcome measures.We found that DOD relies on quality assurance mechanisms that do not ensure a given level of effectiveness for the care provided. Given the factthat DOD has no way to track changes in veterans' health status, we continue to believe that DOD and VA should develop and implement plans to monitor the clinical progress of veterans. 4. DOD incorrectly infers that we have taken the position that a single illness or a few illnesses with specific correct treatments account forveterans' complaints. We repeatedly stated in our draft report thatveterans are experiencing a wide array of symptoms and disablingconditions. 5. DOD's conclusion that research on treatments should await the results of epidemiological studies belies the fact that several illnesses suffered bythese veterans have already been identified but that imperfect treatment GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 74 Appendix V Comments From the Department of Defense exists for these illnesses. Additionally, DOD and VA were directed to conduct research on treatments for ailing Gulf War veterans in thenational defense authorization act for fiscal year 1995. Our report does notrecommend that any ongoing research be discontinued; rather, it pointsout that as a result of the misplaced focus and formidable methodologicalproblems, much of the ongoing epidemiological research will not be ableto provide precise, accurate, and conclusive answers regarding thepotential causes of the Gulf War veterans' illnesses. Moreover, given thatthe majority of federal research already covers epidemiological issues, werecommend that DOD give greater priority to research on treatment for ill veterans and on low-level exposures to chemicals and their interactiveeffects and less priority to further epidemiological studies. 6. IOM also commented that any additional nationwide epidemiologic studies of Gulf War veterans are likely to be of limited scientific value atthis time. At this stage, greater emphasis is warranted on studies thatexplore plausible disease hypotheses rather than large-scalepopulation-based studies of prevalence. While the large-scale federalstudies cited by DOD have yielded descriptive information on the health profile of Gulf War veterans, they have shed less light on why Gulf Warveterans report more health complaints than nondeployed veterans. 7. Regarding research on low-level exposures to various chemical agents, DOD refers to an allocation of slightly more than $15 million for this purpose and describes the process that would be followed to obligatethese funds to specific research projects. However, its comments on ourrecommendation provide no detail on its progress in distributing thesefunds. In its final report, PAC noted that, \" DOD's intransigence in refusing to fund [research on possible long-term health consequences of low-levelexposure to chemical warfare agents] until summer 1996 has doneveterans and the public a disservice.\" 8. DOD partially concurs with our recommendation that it refine current approaches of the clinical and research programs for diagnosis of PTSD , consistent with recent IOM suggestions. IOM recently found that, \"In view of potential exposure to low levels of nerve agents, certain refinements in the CCEP would increase its value.\" IOM recommended improved documentation of the screening used during Phase I for patients withpsychological conditions such as depression and PTSD , noting that \"if there are long-term health effects of nerve agent exposure, it is possible thatthese effects could be manifested as changes in mood or behavior.\" IOM has made other specific recommendations that are consistent with our GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 75 Appendix V Comments From the Department of Defense findings, including the recommendation that physicians take more complete patient histories regarding the onset of health problems andoccupational and environmental exposures to rule out alternativeexplanations for neuropsychological findings. 53 In its comments, DOD refers to diagnostic procedures used in Phase II of the CCEP examination, but these cover a small proportion of participants. 53See Institute of Medicine, Adequacy of Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program: Nerve Agents (Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1997), pp. 16-17.

GAO Comments1. We have changed the word \"illness\" in our report title to \"illnesses.\" 2. VA acknowledges that clinical progress cannot be measured with existing or new databases. VA also notes that \"appropriateness and effectiveness of treatment can only be determined for a specific medicalcondition whose pathogenesis and natural history has been wellcharacterized.\" VA agrees that longitudinal tracking of veterans with specific diagnoses could be of value. The majority of veterans have one ormore diagnoses, which, in combination with their chief health complaints,should provide the basis for evaluating their care. Nevertheless, VA emphasizes the difficulty of evaluating the clinical progress of individualswith undiagnosed conditions. We are not suggesting randomized clinicaltrials of new treatments, as VA appears to imply, but do suggest that the Department develop a plan to monitor the condition of undiagnosedindividuals in order to promote effective symptomatic treatment. Although VA asserts that those veterans who receive no diagnosis for their illnesses are treated appropriately for their symptoms, they do not indicatethat they have any means of ensuring this, and they provide no evidencefor the assertion. As VA suggests, augmenting its collection of data on the progress of ill Gulf War veterans with additional comparative data wouldprovide valuable additional information. However, at a minimum, it seemsdesirable to collect descriptive information on how veterans' conditionshave improved or worsened. 3. VA agrees that research on low-level exposures to chemicals should be given higher priority but does not believe epidemiological studies shouldbe given lower priority. Since VA does not provide evidence to dispute our findings that ongoing epidemiological studies will not provide accurate,precise, or conclusive answers, we continue to believe that emphasis inthe research should be shifted. 4. VA does not concur with our recommendation on the basis that it is already making efforts to refine current approaches of its clinical anddiagnostic programs for diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ). The emphasis of our recommendation is not upon how PTSD is diagnosed at specialty centers but upon how it is diagnosed in the course of ordinaryregistry evaluation and the improved validation of diagnostic methods GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 96 Appendix VI Comments From the Department ofVeterans Affairs used in establishing its prevalence. VA's comments offer no corrective plan. Therefore, we continue to believe that VA should refine the current approaches of the clinical and research programs for diagnosing PTSD . 5. See comment 1.6. VA's comments do not address our specific finding that it has no information on whether Gulf War veterans are any better or worse todaythan when they were initially diagnosed. VA suggests that its current approach provides adequate oversight for Gulf War veterans' care. Wefound that VA relies on quality assurance mechanisms that do not ensure a given level of effectiveness for the care provided. VA agrees with us that the 1996 National Customer Satisfaction Survey was not adequate, and itplans to correct those deficiencies. However, VA has not provided any evidence to us to the contrary. Given the fact that VA has no way to track changes in veterans' health status, we continue to believe that DOD and VA should develop and implement plans to monitor the clinical progress ofveterans. 7. While VA agrees that it is indeed possible that a Gulf War-related exposure to agents may never be precisely linked to Gulf War veterans'illnesses (regardless of how well a study may be designed or what type ofresearch is conducted), it believes that epidemiologic research canprovide important information about the health consequences of Gulf Warservice. We agree that descriptive studies cited by VA are useful in understanding group differences, but it is not clear what hypotheses thesestudies have generated regarding risk factors. Our conclusion remainsvalid regarding the inability of ongoing epidemiological research toprovide precise, accurate, and conclusive answers regarding the causes ofveterans' illnesses because of formidable methodological problems. 8. Comments from the Presidential Advisory Committee and our responses are in appendix VII. Our methodology is described on pages 13 and 14 ofour report. We use an extensive quality assurance process for all of ourproducts, as we did for this report. The expertise of the team whoconducted this review is discussed on page 14. 9. VA notes that our report is thinly supported with few references (approximately 35). However, as we note in our report, we reviewed notonly the articles that PAC cited in support of its conclusions (which we do not list) but also articles published in peer-reviewed journals that PAC did not take into consideration (which we do list). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 97 Appendix VI Comments From the Department ofVeterans Affairs 10. Our report does not imply the assertion VA is making. In our evaluation of federal research strategy, we are reporting our findings on the extent towhich the strategy is coherent. 11. Our conclusion is based on PGVCB -provided data, which show that the vast majority of federal research was initiated during or after 1994 andrelatively few studies have been completed. 12. This is an inaccurate presentation of the statement in our report. We stated in our report that PAC did not provide evidence in support of its assertion that stress is an important contributing factor to the \"broadrange\" of illnesses currently being reported by Gulf War veterans. 13. As our report notes, we reviewed the literature cited by PAC. All but two of these references from peer-reviewed journal articles deal with theputative association with PTSD ; only two discuss the role of general life stress. The scientific articles on PTSD do not present convincing evidence that PTSD is common in Gulf War veterans or that it explains the symptoms reported by Gulf War veterans. All but one of the peer-reviewed studies on PTSD in Gulf War veterans relied on psychometric PTSD scales, unaccompanied by psychiatric interviews, and only minimal elevations ofscores were found. These do not indicate the presence of PTSD . Virtually any illness that causes primary or secondary emotional concern canproduce minimal elevations of scores on the psychometric PTSD scales. The fact that minimal elevations of psychometric scales scores wereslightly higher than those of nondeployed veterans proves only thatdeployed veterans have more illness of some kind, but it does not establishthat it is related to PTSD or general life stress. 14. VA failed to understand the central message underlying the two research studies it cited (Jamal et al., 1996, and Haley et al., 1997). Thesetwo studies demonstrate that the syndrome of chronic fatigue, cognitiveproblems, balance disturbances, joint aches, diarrhea, etc., could beneurological injuries from exposure to chemicals in the war. These studiesalso suggest that routine medical examinations are incapable of detectingchronic neurotoxicity. Thus, the statement that \"the majority of VA Registry participants have conventional medical diagnoses and are beingtreated with appropriate therapies\" is undoubtedly sincerely meant andtrue, but irrelevant. 15. We have stated in our report that while the government found no evidence that biological weapons were deployed during the Gulf War, the GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 98 Appendix VI Comments From the Department ofVeterans Affairs United States lacked the capability to promptly detect biological agents, and the effect of one agent, aflatoxin, would not be observed for manyyears. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 99 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Note: PAC's comments on our draft report, along withour responses to thesecomments, arereproduced here. Due tothe length and highlytechnical nature of PAC'scomments, our responsefollows each individualcomment in the letter,rather than at the end ofthe comments. GAO RESPONSE The purpose of our evaluation of PAC's conclusions with respect to risk factors was to ascertain the amount of knowledge about Gulf War illnessesgenerated by research 6 years after the Gulf War, and evaluate theevidence supporting conclusions on these issues. We reviewed theseconclusions because they are the strongest statements of any official bodythat we have found on these matters. Moreover, the PAC review panel included a number of recognized experts in scientific questions at issuewho were assisted by a large staff of scientists and attorneys. In addition, GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 100 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses PAC extensively reviewed the research on Gulf War veterans' illnesses. Thus, evaluating the strength of the PAC's conclusions provides important evidence about how fruitful research on Gulf War illnesses has been todate. We have repeated in our letter the statement on this point that wehad made in appendix IV. Our report cites PAC's recommendations and significant conclusions. We also carefully reviewed the PAC's interim report, which cites potential problems for federally funded research. We documented that suchproblems affect large portions of the federally sponsored studies (see app.III). GAO RESPONSE Our study is a systematic evaluation of the matters that Congress directedus to examine. We reviewed the scientific literature and published as wellas unpublished work of internal and external bodies. In reviewingconclusions, we examined the support cited as well as additional evidencewe gathered and compared these with the official conclusions. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 101 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses We have added citations to better reflect our use of scientific literature in our review. GAO RESPONSE As we pointed out in our draft report, the number of studies we cite wastaken directly from the most recent (April 1997) annual report to Congressby the official sponsoring and coordinating entity for pertinent research,the Persian Gulf Veterans' Coordinating Board ( PGVCB ). PGVCB , which coordinates research on Gulf War veterans' illnesses involving VA, DOD, and HHS, is required under Public Law 102-585 to report annually on the results and progress of pertinent research activities undertaken or funded by theexecutive branch. GAO RESPONSE We do not confuse PTSD and stress-related effects. Indeed, it is unclear how we could both \"juxtapose\" the distinct issues and simultaneously \"treatthem as a single matter,\" as the comment alternately suggests. We address GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 102 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses these items in tandem in order to prevent the very type of misinterpretation about which the Committee is concerned. In contrast, PAC's report blurs the distinction between PTSD (that is, a specific syndrome caused by emotional trauma) and stress (a potentialrisk factor). To support its conclusion regarding the contribution of stressto veterans' illnesses, PAC cites 18 reports from peer-reviewed journals, but these largely assess the association between stress and PTSD . Only two peer-reviewed articles were presented in support of the broader effects ofstress and neither included measurements of Gulf veterans. Some studies,while intending to assess the extent of PTSD , found little and instead discussed \"stress symptomatology,\" \"trauma-related symptoms,\" or \" PTSD symptoms,\" using these terms to refer to measurements on a PTSD scale that did not meet the validated cutoff for indication of PTSD . GAO RESPONSE As our report notes, we reviewed the literature PAC cited in support of its conclusion. Only two references from peer-reviewed journals wereprovided to substantiate the role of general life stress in the etiology ofveterans' symptoms. 54 Neither reference presented measurements of Gulf War veterans. We noted in our report that this quotation is taken from, \"R.H. Stretch et al., \"Physical Health Symptomatology of Gulf War-era Service PersonnelFrom the States of Pennsylvania and Hawaii,\" Military Medicine , vol. 160 (1995), pp. 131-36. (See app. II.) 54K. C. Hyams & F. S. Wignall, \"War Syndromes and Their Evaluation: From the U.S. Civil War to the Persian Gulf War,\" Annals of Internal Medicine , vol. 125 (1996), pp. 398-405 and G. P. Chrousos & P. W. Gold, \"The Concepts of Stress and Stress System Disorders,\" Journal of the American Medical Association , vol. 267 (1992), pp. 1244-1252. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 103 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE Stress can be associated with a wide range of physical illnesses, and we do not suggest that illnesses that are stress-induced are any less real.However, we did not find evidence that the broad range of Gulf Warveterans' physical symptoms were induced by stress. (See our response tothe next comment.) GAO RESPONSE We reviewed the reports from the Fort Devens and the New Orleansstudies on PTSD , but these two studies provide little support for Committee's conclusion that \"stress is likely to be an importantcontributing factor to the broad range of illnesses currently being reportedby Gulf War veterans.\" First, the primary focus of each of these studies is GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 104 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses the measurement of PTSD . Second, the symptom measures employed in both studies focused selectively on psychological, psychosomatic, and/orstress-related conditions. For example, the New Orleans study employed achecklist inquiring about 20 conditions\u201411 taken from a scale ofpsychosomatic complaints and 9 other symptoms that are commonlyobserved to be stress-related. 55 The samples of deployed troops who indicated high war-zone stress checked more items on this symptom listthan those classed as having low or no war zone stress, but 4 to 10 monthsafter the war, only three complaints (nervousness, concentrationdifficulties, and needing medications to sleep or calm down) showedstatistically significant differences based on war-zone stress. Third, nophysical examination was conducted in these studies, so it is impossible todetermine whether the measured symptoms were selectively related to war zone stress. Fourth, in both studies, there is some possibility that therelationships between war zone stress and symptoms are byproducts ofsimilarities in the methods used to measure them; the Fort Devens studyacknowledges some research showing that self-reports of stress arevulnerable to bias from a host of event-related and personalcharacteristics. Finally, in the Fort Devens study, the total amount ofvariation in reported symptoms that was explained by the combination ofcombat exposure stress and a variety of other factors was quite modest(13 percent). 56 The Committee's remark concerning diagnostic methods suggests that theinclusion of control groups overcomes bias from faulty methods formeasuring PTSD . First, the method recognized by experts in the field of PTSD research for conclusively making the diagnosis of PTSD is a psychiatrist's or psychologist's clinical interview following a structuredinterview protocol, such as the CAPS or SCID. (See app. V, DOD's response to GAO's report.) Of the 18 peer-reviewed studies of Gulf War veterans cited by the PAC report in support of its conclusions on stress, only one used this method.57 All others relied on psychometric scales. Second, if the deployed veterans suffered subtle neurological damage, for example from chronicpesticide exposures, their scores on the psychometric PTSD scales could be falsely elevated, while those of the nondeployed controls, not exposed topesticides, would not be. The use of a control group would not correct forthis type of bias. 55P. B.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 105 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We refer to the use of major diagnostic categories from the International Classifications of Diseases - 9th Revision to report on various types ofconditions as a group. For example, the category \"psychologicalconditions\" is used to report data from DOD's clinical program. The diagnoses included in the ICD-9 series for psychological conditions covereverything from relatively common, transient, and easily treatedconditions, such as tension headache, to more intractable disorders, likeclinical depression. It is not clear what clinical or scientific purpose isserved by discussing these varied diagnoses as a group. In the PAC report, under the heading \"Data on Stress-Related Disorders\" (see p. 71), the Committee notes that \"psychological conditions are eitherthe primary or secondary diagnosis in 36.0 percent of CCEP participants,\" and that \"the most common conditions are: major depressive disorder,neurotic depression (also called dysthymia), depression (not otherwisespecified), PTSD , anxiety disorders, adjustment disorders, alcohol-related disorders, and substance-related disorders.\" However, as noted in thefootnote to the table on page 72 of the PAC report, the single most common condition in this category is actually tension headache (11.3 percent of CCEP participants and 2.3 percent of registry participants). Apart from tension headache, none of the individual diagnoses listed in this categoryis the primary diagnosis for more than 3 percent of CCEP registrants. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 106 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We quoted from page 34 of PAC's Final Report, \"Currently, stress is the risk factor funded for the greatest fraction of total studies\u201432 studies(30 percent).\" However, we have now substituted the figure provided by PAC. GAO RESPONSE As PAC notes, we did not conclude that stress was incompatible or incapable of producing physical symptoms; we concur with PAC's assessment of this matter. However, we do not find that PAC has cited evidence that stress is likely to be an important contributing factor to the GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 107 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses broad range of illnesses that veterans report. We have revised the statement in table IV.1 to clarify this point. Regarding the health effects of low-level exposure to chemical warfare agents, the Committee suggested in 1996 that \"the government should planfor further research on possible long-term health effects of low-levelexposure to organophosphorus nerve agents, such as sarin, soman, orvarious pesticides, based on studies of groups with well-characterizedexposures, including (a) cases of U.S. workers exposed toorganophosphorus pesticides and (b) civilians exposed to the chemicalwarfare agent sarin during the 1994 and 1995 terrorist attacks in Japan.Additional work should include follow-up and evaluation of an appropriatesubset of any U.S. service personnel who are presumed to be exposedduring the Gulf War. The government should begin by consulting withappropriate experts, both governmental and nongovernmental, onorganophosphorus nerve agent effects. Studies of human populations withwell-characterized exposures will be much more revealing than studiesbased on animal models, which should be given lower priority.\" ( PAC, Final Report , p. 54) Accidental and occupational exposures like those cited by PAC are rarely \"well characterized,\" and due to the potentially toxic nature of theexposures, animal studies will be more important to characterizing theeffects, particularly synergistic ones. Although PAC concluded that \"ongoing federally funded studies should help the scientific communitydraw conclusions about the synergistic effects of PB and other riskfactors\" (Final Report , p. 117), we could find no PAC recommendation for additional research on the synergistic health effects of pyridostigminebromide and other risk factors. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 108 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE All but one of the 18 studies on PTSD in Gulf War veterans cited by the PAC report based diagnoses of PTSD on psychometric PTSD scales without confirmatory psychiatric interviews. These instruments are validated forscreening, not diagnosis. In addition, care must be taken in evaluatingelevated scores that do not surpass validated cut-points for discriminationof PTSD and non- PTSD populations.58 GAO RESPONSE The PAC states that its review of studies [on PTSD ] was based on those with high participation rates. However, most of the cited studies presented PTSD survey data based on samples that were not statistically generalizable.Among those that did employ generalizable samples, participation ratesvaried from 25 percent to 58 percent, but no comparison of participantsand nonparticipants was presented to assess the likelihood of selectionbias. We respond to the Committee's second and third points elsewhere in this appendix. 58See, for example, the discussion by T. M. Keane et al., \"Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Three Studies in Reliability and Validity,\" Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology , vol. 56(1) (1988), pp. 85-90. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 109 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE Control groups are not a substitute for accurate diagnostic methods. For example, without accurate diagnosis, it is possible that neurologicalsymptoms related to war-related exposures apart from stress will bemisattributed to PTSD . In addition, some studies have employed modified PTSD scales incorporating questions that may become markers for recent war participation, rather than evidence of PTSD . These questions would selectively increase scores in the Gulf War group. GAO RESPONSE We quote from testimony provided to PAC on March 26, 1996, by Dr. Peter Spencer, who is the principal investigator of a large, federally fundedstudy. As known since 1995 and acknowledged in the PAC report (p. 118), the incubation period for classical visceral leishmaniasis (usually causedby L. donovani) may exceed 2.5 years. 59 In addition, the natural history of a newly recognized form of the illness (viscerotropic leishmaniasis) is 59W. H. Jopling, \"Long Incubation British Medical Journal, vol. 2:1013 (1955). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 110 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses unknown.60 Those whose immune systems become weakened for any reason will be at particular risk. In such patients, the development ofvisceral leishmaniasis (involving malaise, lassitude, weight loss,splenomegaly, and anemia) up to 20 years after exposure has beendocumented. 61 GAO RESPONSE Insofar as no screening or simple diagnostic test is currently available fornewly recognized forms of leishmaniasis, there is an insufficient basis toassess the success of the clinical examinations in detecting it. However,this presumption is the primary basis on which the Committee dismissesthe notion that leishmania infection is much of a continuing problem. In aMarch 13, 1997, briefing, experts from Walter Reed Army Institute ofResearch told us that \"most clinicians will fail to recognize 'classic' formsof leishmaniasis, much less atypical clinical presentations.\" As we note inthe report, a CDC analysis appears to concur that the signs of a newly recognized form of the disease are nonspecific and that the diagnosedcases were identified by aggressive case-finding. 62 It stands to reason that diagnosis would be difficult insofar as leishmaniasis is generally unknownin the United States. While PAC concludes that viscerotropic leishmaniasis is not considered to be a cause of widespread illness among Gulf Warveterans, PAC acknowledges on p. 118 of its Final Report that \"viscerotropic leishmaniasis can be difficult to confirm.\" 60A.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 111 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We have modified the statements in our letter summarizing our findings to match the statement in appendix IV, which incorporates the role of theweakened immune system. It is in cases in which the patient's immunesystem becomes deficient that such reexpression of previouslyasymptomatic infection is a concern. 63 However, because it is not possible to predict which persons' immune systems may become weakened, webelieve that it is important for all veterans and health care professionals tounderstand the significance of such potential infection. In addition, thenatural history of the viscerotropic form of leishmaniasis is not wellunderstood; that is, little is known about the length of incubation and thecourse of disease. 64 While it could be consistent with some of the Gulf War veterans'symptoms, we do not contend in our report that leishmaniasis\u2014or anyother illness of which we are aware\u2014would explain the range ofsymptoms currently being reported in the veterans. 63See, for example, A. J., Magill, et al., \"Visceral Infection Due to Leishmania tropica in a Veteran of Operation Desert Storm Who Presented 2 Years After Leaving Saudi Arabia, Clinical Infectious Diseases , vol. 19 (Oct. 19, 1994), pp. 805-6. These authors note, \"...the presence of a cofactor depressing cell-mediated immunity (malnutrition, immunosuppressive drug treatments, AIDS, ormalignancy) can lead to symptomatic leishmanial disease....\" See also , R. Badaro, et al. \"Leishmaniadonovani: An Opportunistic Microbe Associated With Progressive Disease in ThreeImmunocompromised Patients,\" Lancet , vol. 1 (1986), pp. 647-9. 64Even infection with the same species of parasite (Leishmania donovani) can take widely different courses (see Badaro et al., \"New Perspectives on a Subclinical Form of Visceral Leishmaniasis,\" The of Infectious Diseases , vol. 154(6), pp. 1003-1011.). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 112 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses We noted the reemergence of leishmaniasis in Europe in the context of noting that the infection can flare when the immune system is weakened;the comparability of the exposed groups is not relevant to the point thatwe were making. 65 GAO RESPONSE We presume that veterans are concerned about their future health as wellas their current health. In the absence of simple diagnostic tests, it isdifficult to judge the extent of current illness attributable to leishmaniainfection. The more important point is whether these veterans are ill as a result of their exposure. The risk of sandfly fever to U.S. troops in the Gulf wasbelieved to be high. Although we recognize that it is possible that some ofthese veterans may have been deployed to other areas in which they mighthave contracted this disease, the blood samples that CDC analyzed were taken after their return to the United States from the Gulf. 65See, for example, Phillip G. Lawyer, \"Leishmaniasis Update,\" Proceedings of the 1995 DOD Pest Management Workshop (1995), p. 3 (http://www.afpmb.acq.osd.milpubs/present/htm). He states, \"The emergence of VL [viscerotropic leishmaniasis] as a serious opportunistic infection in AIDS patients inEurope has alarming implication for leishmaniasis endemic areas where the prevalence of HIVinfection is increasing (Africa, Brazil, Indian subcontinent).\" GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 113 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE Medical surveillance during the war was imperfect. While some reports indicate no cases of sandfly fever, at least six cases of febrile illnesscompatible with sandfly fever were reported among soldiers of the 1/505PIR on September 22, 1990, by a preventive medicine officer. In addition,the risk of sandfly fever was believed to be high. A December 1991Defense Intelligence Agency report presented tests of blood samples fromIraqi military personnel involved in the Gulf War. These tests wereconducted to help identify biological warfare agents in the Iraqi inventoryand assess the prevalence of endemic diseases. In discussing naturallyoccurring diseases, the report notes, \"The large percentage of positivereactions to sandfly fever (Sicilian and Naples strain) confirms the highrisk this disease poses for US military operations in the region.\" For theSicilian strain, 98 of 125 samples were positive, and 49 of 126 sampleswere positive for the Naples strain. (In contrast, only 21 of 130 sampleswere positive for exposure to Q-fever.) Thus, if there were no cases ofsandfly fever, it seems difficult to explain their complete absence. It is true that the presence of evidence of exposure to sandfly fever did not distinguish persons with the cluster of fatigue symptoms defined by CDC from persons who did not fit this definition. However, this does notobviate the need to exclude such infection in diagnosing particularveterans' fatigue and posttraumatic symptoms. Sandfly fever would notconsistently result in such complications, though it might sometimes beresponsible for them. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 114 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE First, references have been provided in footnotes 28-36 of appendix III. Second, our specific responses to the claim that we have mischaracterized the Committee's conclusions are set forth below. Third, we have clarified statements that may have led the Committee to infer that we claimed that all organophosphates compounds producesimilar long-term effects. Fourth, we are careful to distinguish between those individuals who are ill today and individuals who may become ill in the future. For example, ourdiscussion of aflatoxin is largely about potential cancers in the future. Fifth, as directed by Congress, we conducted our own independent, objective review. Our review included reviewing reports and scientificliterature, interviewing researchers, and analyzing the information GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 115 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses available to us. Through this review we reached different conclusions from those of the PAC. In any event, given PAC's finding that minimal research is available on the health effects of low-level exposure, it is difficult tounderstand the rationale for its conclusion that chemical warfare agentexposures are unlikely to be consistent with veterans' health complaints.Moreover, we note that findings of some studies on such low-levelexposures are not supportive of such a conclusion. We respond to PAC's remarks concerning its recommendations elsewhere in this appendix. Insofar as the Committee clearly feels strongly about the need for additional research, we find it difficult to understand the rationale behind PAC's conclusion that it is unlikely these exposures could have contributed to veterans' health complaints. GAO RESPONSE PAC's (first) comment incorrectly misinterprets our point. As noted, PAC formed some of its conclusions in the absence of exposure data. However,we have removed the quotation. Some of the Committee's conclusions are inconsistent with the results of applying its analytic framework. For example, it is difficult to understandwhy the Committee concludes that the agent in question is \"unlikely\" tohave contributed to the health problems reported by veterans even as itrecognizes the need for data on the health effects of low-level exposure. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 116 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE As we noted in an earlier report, \"available bomb damage assessments during the war concluded that 16 of 21 sites categorized by Gulf Warplanners as nuclear, biological, and chemical ( NBC) facilities had been successfully destroyed. However, information compiled by the UnitedNations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) since the end of Desert Storm reveals that the number of suspected NBC targets identified by U.S. planners, both prior to and during the campaign, did not fully encompassall the possible NBC targets in Iraq.\" UNSCOM has conducted investigations at a large number of facilities suspected by the U.S. authorities as being NBC related. Regarding the few suspected weapons sites that have not yet beeninspected by UNSCOM , we have been able to determine that each was attacked by coalition aircraft during Desert Storm and that one site islocated within the Kuwait theater of operations in closer proximity to theborder, where coalition ground forces were located. However, we have yetto learn why these facilities have not been investigated. 66 66See Operation Desert Storm: Evaluation of the Air Campaign (GAO/NSIAD-97-134 , June 12, 1997, p. 2). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 117 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE PAC has misinterpreted our position on the proper sequencing of studies. Research into the nature of the health effects of agents to which troopsmay have been exposed during Operation Desert Storm should not waitfor accurate answers to questions of the magnitude of actual exposures.We neither state nor imply otherwise. In its reference to a statement we made in table IV.1, we made that statement to provide background for our assessment. We have deleted theword \"given,\" which may have left the incorrect impression that theCommittee did not take account of the presence of chemical warfareagents at Khamisiyah and elsewhere on the battlefield. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 118 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We cite animal studies showing that exposures to certain organophosphate agents at levels that do not cause acute poisoning areassociated with measurable long-term effects. It appears inconsistent forthe Committee both to conclude that exposures to organophosphateagents are unlikely to have contributed to veterans' health problems andsimultaneously to recognize the existence of minimal research onlow-level exposure\u2014the most likely exposure scenario fororganophosphate pesticides. The Committee may have overlooked a set of articles published in peer-reviewed journals by Husain et al. addressing the chronicneurotoxicity of low-level exposure to sarin. In these studies, theinvestigators exposed hens and mice, in separate experiments, daily for 10days to sub-acute doses of sarin orally and through inhalation. The animalsdid not require protection by simultaneous administration of atropine andpralidoxime, often used in high-dose experiments. Fourteen days after thestart of the daily exposures, some of the animals developed effects (forexample, ataxia, muscular weakness), suggesting that sarin can induce OPIDN . These studies have been discussed since they were published in 1993, 1994, and 1995, and they have received no serious criticism of whichwe are aware. It appears that DOD, PGVCB , and PAC have not recognized and commented on them, while continuing to insist that there is no evidencethat low-level sarin can cause chronic neurotoxicity in the absence ofsevere immediate effects. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 119 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE The comment by PAC reflects a selective reading of the work by Duffy and Burchfiel in the area of the EEG effects of organophosphates. Indeed, theauthors characterized one of the tests that they conducted on the EEGs oftreatment and control groups as \"inconclusive.\" 67 However, they also reported statistically significant differences between the two groups onseveral other measures, such as the increase in the amount of beta activityin EEGs and an increase in rapid eye movement sleep. The authorsconcluded that, \"Our EEG findings and the psychological reports in theliterature provide parallel warnings of possible long-term CNS toxicity ofOP agents.\" 68 Additionally, in recent testimony before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Professor Duffy madethe following observations, which support our conclusions about theeffects on the behavior of organophosphates (including sarin): \"It is quite possible to have a biologically significant exposure to OP compounds and not be aware of it...Sarin can produce long term alteration of brain function. Levels of exposurecapable of producing such late effects may not be recognizable by subjects, especially ifthey are unaware of what is happening and/or are distracted by other activities.\" 69 The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board also reviewed these studies and found that, \"they represent reasonable evidence that even small doses(exact level is unknown) may result in EEG changes.\" 70 67James L.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 120 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We have cited the work of Dr. Haley and his colleagues as a positive example of an attempt to refine a case definition in the presence of diffuseand nonspecific symptoms. His approach, to look for patterns ofcorrelation among the reported symptoms and explore their relationshipwith exposure history, is a reasonable and rational first step upon whichothers might build. We discussed Dr. Haley's approach with two leadingepidemiologists, who agreed that the approach Dr. Haley had taken wasreasonable in an instance in which a case definition was difficult to derive.In fact, elsewhere in the aforementioned editorial, Dr. Landrigan concurswith the major thrust of our position: \"Haley et al. suggest that some cases of illness in members of their population may represent chronic neurotoxicity caused by low-dose exposures to chemical warfare agents.This is an important question that demands serious investigation... Further research is GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 121 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses needed to determine whether low-dose exposure to chemical warfare agents can cause chronicneurotoxicity.71 We agree with Dr. Landrigan on this point. It is also our contention, based on the evidence presented in our report, that the federal research programhas not pursued this question with sufficient energy. It is apparent to us, based on the literature that we reviewed and the references cited, that the hypothesis that some veterans' illnesses are OPIDN or similar to OPIDN that may stem from exposure from pesticides, chemical warfare agents, or pyridostigmine bromide while on duty in thePersian Gulf is a plausible hypothesis. We disagree with PAC's conclusions that these are unlikely exposure scenarios for the illnesses beingexperienced by veterans. Moreover, we fail to understand the Committee'srationale for endorsing additional studies in this area after discounting thelikelihood of the hypothesis. In fact, it should be noted that CDC took similar steps to construct a case definition in its review of symptomsreported by a large group of Gulf War veterans. Dr. Haley's work hasapparently generated plausible hypotheses for further exploration andtesting. 71P. J. Landrigan, Illness in Gulf War Veterans.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 122 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE Concerning exposure to aflatoxin, for the reasons cited earlier, we can neither confirm nor rule out veterans' exposure to this agent. The CentralIntelligence Agency has noted that the health effects of exposure toaerosolized aflatoxin are poorly understood. Descriptive studies of clearly defined endpoints may be useful in providing assurance that large numbers of veterans are not suffering the healthproblems characteristic of aflatoxin exposure. However, it is important tonote that only in the instance of widespread exposure would this approachresolve the issue of whether particular veterans' health problems areattributable to their Gulf War service. In response to the general comment concerning the value of epidemiologic studies of Gulf War veterans, we agree that some basic descriptiveinformation on veterans' health may be useful, to include the cancersurveillance studies identified by PAC, for the purpose of providing veterans with information about the presence of widespread and serioushealth effects. However, it will be very difficult for these studies to resolvethe issue of whether specific veterans' health problems are related to theirGulf War service in the absence of (a) widespread exposure; (b)biomarkers for exposure; or (c) better data on who was exposed and atwhat levels. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 123 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We have added text to note the Committee's findings. The PAC concluded, \"Aflatoxin...is a liver carcinogen, and increased rates of liver cancer couldresult decades following low-level exposure, although available evidencereviewed by the Committee does not indicate such exposures occurredduring the Gulf War.\" ( PAC, Final Report , p. 112.) GAO considers exposure to aflatoxin as an unresolved issue. GAO RESPONSE We have added text to clarify our position regarding the likely utility offurther epidemiologic research in light of the absence of adequateexposure data. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 124 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We used the methodological categorizations identified by PGVCB as reported for each study in PGVCB research plans and reports to Congress. The categories identified by PAC appear to be an amalgam of methodological approaches and topical emphases. GAO RESPONSE Appendix IV contains a more detailed discussion of the PAC's conclusions and our assessments. GAO RESPONSE Our specific rebuttals to PAC's individual assertions on these matters are set forth below. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 125 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE Concerning delayed neurotoxic effects of organophosphates, not all organophosphates cause these effects; however the Committee isincorrect in implying that pesticides to which U.S. service people wereexposed in the war could not have caused delayed neurotoxicity. 72 As PAC reports on p. 97 of its Final Report , Chlorpyrifos (Dursban) was shipped to the Gulf. Dursban has been linked to delayed, chronic neurotoxicity inlaboratory animals. In the past, the delayed, chronic neurotoxic potentialof chlorpyrifos was overlooked. 73 The Environmental Protection Agency has recently penalized the manufacturer for failing to promptly reporthuman injuries from this pesticide and suggested that the pesticide berelabeled to withdraw it from many applications, a decision with whichthe company acquiesced. In addition, other unknown pesticide chemicalsmay have been brought from the United States or purchased from localsuppliers in Saudi Arabia by troops outside the command structure; thesecannot be enumerated by fromsubsequent organophosphate exposure, studies of similar drugs indicatethat treatment sufficient organophospates \"Organic Phosphate Insecticide Poisoning, American Medicine (Mar. 1958), pp. 467-70; E.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 126 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses chronic neurotoxicity.74 There is evidence from laboratory studies that post-exposure treatment can cause chronic neurotoxicity to occur withorganophosphate doses that would ordinarily be too low to cause aproblem (pharmacologic \"promotion\"), or it could turn a mild case oforganophosphate-induced chronic neurotoxicity into a severe case(pharmacologic \"potentiation\"). Several papers have appeared on thissubject since 1990, although studies of post-exposure promotion bypyridostigmine per se have not been undertaken as far as we know. In response to the committee's assertion that the only evidence for synergism among pyridostigmine bromide, permethrin, and DEET is from in bioassays lethal doses, Haley et al. found epidemiologicevidence that pyridostigmine toxicity and a chemical nerve agent mayhave acted synergistically to cause a syndrome they labelled\"confusion-ataxia,\" the most severe of the three primary syndromes theyidentify. 75 They also found both pyridostigmine toxicity and DEET exposures to be strongly associated with their syndrome 3(arthro-myo-neuropathy). In any event, standard risk analytic practiceinvolves study of interactive effects in laboratory animals at doses thatresult in acute toxicity and to further characterize the relationship fromthat point. We have made the point that further study of the effects of thisas well as other exposures is warranted. 74Op cit., M. Lotti, p. 473; C. N.

GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 127 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We are uncertain what type of evidence PAC would consider sufficient to conclude that some effect might have occurred. While studies testing thetoxic effects on humans have not been conducted, available animal studiesprovide reasonable evidence of negative effects that make it premature toconclude this is not a serious a risk factor and indicate that furtherresearch should be conducted. For obvious ethical reasons, it is notpossible to conduct experimental studies on humans of effects that arefeared to be toxic; thus, standard toxicological approaches used by thegovernment and the private sector focus on research with animals.Researchers have shown that the neurotoxic phenomenon produced byorganophosphate nerve agents in some poultry varieties was comparableto the manifestations produced in man. 76 In this regard, it is known that organophosphate compounds that are neurotoxic to chickens will alsoproduce neurotoxicity in humans under appropriate conditions. For example, the laboratory studies published by Abou-Donia et al. demonstrated that pyridostigmine, chlorpyrifos, permethrin, and DEET can synergistically act to cause delayed, chronic neurotoxicity. The hen is theEPA-required laboratory model for testing chemicals for the potential tocause OPIDN . Testing these chemicals for synergism in humans would have been highly unethical. The doses of permethrin, DEET , chlorpyrifos and pyridostigmine were intended to be in the range of sublethal humanexposure. Given the severity of the OPIDN that occurred with chemical combinations in the doses used, it is possible that lower, but still medicallysignificant, levels of damage would follow even with slightly lower dosesof pyridostigmine. The Abou-Donia group administered pyridostigmine bromide orally; likewise were administered pyridostigmine orally. Thepermethrin, chlorpyrifos, and DEET were injected by needle into the skin just under the surface (intradermally) to simulate the probable absorptionthrough the skin. Since under their feathers hens have thicker skin thanhumans, it is common laboratory practice to deliver skin exposure to hensby intradermal injection. We believe the Committee erred in notconsidering the findings of the Abou-Donia et al. studies to be indicative ofexpected effects on humans. 76Stockholm International Institute for Peace Research (SIPRI), Delayed Toxic Effects of Chemical Warfare Agents (New York: Alonquist and Wiksell International, 1975). GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 128 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We are unaware of studies specifically testing, with sufficiently sensitive neurophysiologic techniques, for long-term neurotoxic side effects ofpyridostigmine in any prior population taking pyridostigmine regularly. Weare, however, aware that patients taking pyridostigmine are cautioned toavoid exposure to malathion, which was among the pesticides sent to theGulf. 77 Concerning the Committee's assertion that research is in flux,pyridostigmine bromide may have been used in the presence ofcontraindicated coexposures (malathion) and may potentiate the effects ofDursban. In response to the Committee's point about delayed neurotoxic effects, we have modified our statement to read, \"delayed neurotoxic effects inhumans exposed to PB and DEET have been epidemiologically inferred and reproduced in hens.\" Human evidence of the synergisticeffects of pyridostigmine, DEET , chlorpyrifos, and chemical nerve agents has been presented for an epidemiologic association between patterns ofcomplaints and reported exposures of these agents in humans. 78 77\"Pyridostigmine,\" in Clinical Pharmacology (Online\u2014http://www.cponline.gsm.com), Gold Standard Multimedia Inc., 1994. 78Op cit., Haley et al. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 129 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE We respond to PAC's remarks concerning its recommendations elsewhere in this appendix. GAO RESPONSE Concerning the Committee's observation that DOD was not the only reviewer of its report, we note that DOD publicly endorsed PAC's findings. However, we have added a note that \" PAC has asked us to point out that 'DOD was not the only party involved in [its] external review.....VA, HHS, veterans service organizations, and individual veterans and veteransadvocates also reviewed [its] Interim and Final Report.' PAC does not provide information on the extent to which these reviewers agreed with itsfindings or had their comments incorporated.\" Again, our purpose was notto conduct a review of PAC's activities but to identify and assess the strength of support for conclusions that had been drawn from theavailable research. GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 130 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses GAO RESPONSE Where the Committee has requested that specific changes be made to table IV.1, we have incorporated them (see previous comments). We have presented our detailed responses to the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee in this appendix. We summarize the major points below: GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 131 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Where the Committee has expressed concerns about citations and cross references to other studies, we have provided additional references andhave modified the language in some instances to ensure that other readerswill not misconstrue the meaning of our report. We double-checked theinformation that the Committee challenged and generally found that thedata had been correctly stated. Moreover, a careful review of PAC comments indicates that they represent a selective presentation of datathat tend to bias the reader's perception of the issues. Therefore, we havenot changed the overall thrust of our report. The Committee also takes issue with our reviews of its conclusions regarding psychological stress, leishmaniasis, and chemical warfareagents. Regarding stress, PAC states that we ignored its analytical framework, which was to presume that stress occurred and determine whether thetypes of symptoms and conditions reported by veterans were consistentwith exposure to stress. However, the Committee did not provide evidencethat stress is an important contributing factor to the \"broad range\" ofillnesses currently being reported by Gulf War veterans. Although weagree that life stress can be associated with a wide array of physicalsymptoms, the research cited by the Committee largely assesses therelationship between stress and PTSD , which is not a common diagnosis among Gulf War veterans. Although the Committee notes that scores on PTSD screening questionnaires are higher among Gulf War veterans than among controls,problems are associated with interpreting scores on these scales below thevalidated cutoff points for PTSD risk. In addition, confirmatory psychiatric interviews to eliminate alternative explanations for elevated PTSD screening scores were not done in most of these studies. Thus, thepossibility remains that Gulf War veterans show higher average scores on PTSD screening scales due to other conditions or nonstress-related exposures selectively associated with service. Some studies also modified PTSD screening instruments to make them more applicable to Gulf War veterans; an unintended consequence of this modification is theintroduction of information bias (that is, adding questions that selectivelyaffect the scores of Gulf War veterans). Finally, as we note in our report, atleast one study that examined the relationship between stress andveterans' physical symptoms in a large sample found none, and in aseparate report, its authors noted that, \"Although the stress that the GAO/NSIAD-97-163 Gulf War Illnesses Page 132 Appendix VII Comments From the Presidential AdvisoryCommittee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses deployed veterans are experiencing can be characterized as substantial, it is being handled unremarkably.\"79 Regarding our evaluation of the conclusion that the likelihood ofleishmania infection has diminished as an explanation for widespreadillness, the Committee asked, based on the low numbers of cases ofleishmaniasis diagnosed in DOD and VA clinical programs, that we justify any continued concern about asymptomatic infection. While there is nofundamental disagreement regarding the available facts or the basiccircumstances under which asymptomatic infection is a concern, theCommittee's justification for dismissal of leishmania as a risk factor restsheavily on two assumptions: (1) that diagnostic programs have been highlylikely to detect the disease, even in the absence of any widely availablescreening or diagnostic tests and in the presence of nonspecific symptoms,and (2) that the course of various forms of leishmaniasis is wellunderstood by scientists and by the doctors examining the veterans. Asdiscussed in our report, we find these assumptions remain open toquestion. Moreover, during our exit conference, DOD and VA officials voiced agreement with our concerns in this regard. Insofar as the prevalence ofthis infection is still unknown and it is impossible to predict whichveterans' immune systems will be weakened, it is premature to discardleishmaniasis as a risk factor. Finally, regarding our evaluation of the Committee's conclusion that low-level chemical exposures are unlikely to be associated with veterans'health conditions, the Committee appears not to contest the fact thatlaboratory data document specific health effects in animals exposed toone or more organophosphate agents not detectable by the usual clinicaltests. While the Committee notes that it recommended additional researchin this area, we find it difficult to reconcile the Committee's dismissal ofsuch exposure as an \"unlikely\" contributor to veterans' health problemswith its acknowledgement of an absence of data on an important exposurescenario. Moreover, although the Committee apparently found no data tosuggest a problem with low-level exposures, we found some data that dopose concerns. While PAC argues that these studies were done on animals, they are consistent with standard toxicological practice employed by theEnvironmental Protection Agency and others. The Committee's insistencethat such effects be demonstrated in humans appears unreasonableinsofar as humans cannot be exposed to toxic substances for experimentalresearch for obvious ethical reasons.
