Antitumour immunization is a complex, multi component task, and the optimal combinations of antigens, adjuvants, delivery vehicles and routes of administration are not yet identified. Active immunotherapy must also address the immunosuppressive and tolerogenic mechanisms deployed by tumours. This Review provides an overview of new results from clinical studies of therapeutic cancer vaccines directed against tumour associated antigens and discusses their implications for the use of active immunotherapy. Melero, I. et al. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. (2014); published online 8 July 2014; doi:10.1 038/nrclinonc.2014.1 11 Introduction Immunotherapies against existing cancers include active, passive or immunomodulatory strategies. Whereas active immunotherapies increase the ability of the patient's own immune system to mount an immune response to recognize tumour-associated antigens and eliminate malignant cells, passive immunotherapy involves admin - istration of exogenously produced components, such as lymphocytes or antibodies, to mediate an immune response. Immunomodulatory agents are not targeted at specific antigens, but enhance general immune respon - siveness and are intended to amplify anticancer immune responses. Although there is some overlap between these categories, they provide a useful conceptual framework. Active immunotherapy has been in clinical use for a long time (Figure 1 (Timeline)). The concept that the immune system can be harnessed by vaccination to specific ally eradicate malignant cells has been repeat - edly demonstrated in animal models, but was sometimes questioned by the results of trials in humans.1,2 Malignant cells always harbour mutations and are often genetically unstable leading to numerous changes in the repertoire of epitopes (so-called neo-antigens) they present, sug - gesting that, in theory, tumours should be 'visible' to T lymphocytes. The mechanisms required to mount effective anti - tumour responses have been reviewed by Mellman and colleagues (Figure 2).3 In the first step, tumour- associated antigens (TAAs) must be directly presented by tumour cells or captured, processed and presented by dendri - tic cells. The second step requires presence of suitable acti - vation and/or maturation signals that allow dendritic cells to differentiate, migrate to the lymph nodes, and present TAAs to naive T cells. The third step involves expan - sion of T cells in sufficient numbers so as to recognize and eliminate tumour cells. However, in the absence of suitable maturation signals, antigen presentation leads to T-cell anergy or production of regulatory T cells (TREG) that suppress effector T cells. Finally, antigen-educated T cells must leave the lymph node, traffic to infiltrate the tumour and persist for long enough to kill the malignant cells. In this Review, we focus on immunotherapies that aim to induce or augment immune responses against TAA. The use of vaccines directed against oncogenic viruses for the prevention or treatment of cancer are not discussed. Principles of active immunotherapy Antigens Active immunotherapy encompasses a diverse range of strategies, some of which target multiple, undefined antigens whereas others specifically target a particular antigen or a group of antigens.

Additionally, poly - valent vaccines are likely to carry mutations that drive the tumour's malignant phenotype. However, only a frac - tion of the targeted antigens will be specific to tumour cells, and the production of personalized polyvalent i mmunotherapies is often time and labour intensive. Antigen-specific active immunotherapies are more suitable for reproducible, large-scale production than whole tumour or dendritic cell vaccines. Most antigen- specific immunotherapies have incorporated a single antigen, and narrow epitope specificity might have contri buted to lack of efficacy in some trials.5,6 Moreover, most tumour antigens are based on wild-type protein sequences that are overexpressed in many cancers of the same tissue origin. As tumour antigens are derived from self-antigens, it is likely that high-avidity T -cell recep - tors (TCR) will have been deleted from the repertoire. An immune response directed against a single antigen can induce immunity against other TAAs,7,8 and this 'epitope spreading' might mitigate the potential weakness of narrow epitope specificity. Immunization with long peptides incorporating multiple epitopes9,10 or a mixture of different peptides,11,12 often incorporating both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II epitopes, can improve immunogenicity.Many TAAs have been identified, some of which are shared with normal tissues, whereas others are unique to tumours (Box 1). Shared TAAs include cancer-testis and differentiation antigens that are either silent or expressed at low levels in normal tissues, but are transcription - ally activated in certain tumours. Individual TAAs are character istic of single neoplasms, but the identification of these TAAs through mass screening is currently not feasible in routine practice. Immune peptidome analysis of HLA-bound peptides,13 and whole-exome sequenc - tumour cells14 coupled with epitope prediction by bioinformatics are being used to identify new TAAs and disease biomarkers and might bring truly personalized immunotherapy a step closer to becoming an affordable reality in clinical practice. Adjuvants and delivery vehicles Adjuvants are substances or interventions that, when combined with an antigen, enhance antigen immuno - genicity and elicit the desired immune response. In cancer therapy, the desired response involves pre - dominantly the activation of IFN-producing type 1 T helper cells (TH1) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Classical in prophy - lactic v accines\u2014promote type 2 T helper cells (TH2)- dependent humoral immunity, but rarely induce strong TH1-dependent responses.15 This shortcoming has driven the d evelopment of a range of new adjuvants (Box 1). Water-in-oil emulsions, such as Freund's adjuvants, have been used widely in cancer vaccines, but failed to prove efficacy in clinical trials. Water-in-oil emulsion adjuvants were originally designed for slow release of antigen from a depot at the vaccination site. This strat - egy might work well with vaccines aimed to elicit potent antibody responses, but, as Hailemichael and colleagues16 demonstrated, this slow-release mechanism might be detrimental if the purpose is to generate tumour- specific CTL responses, as activated T cells become trapped and accumulate at the vaccination site rather than in the tumour. This discrepancy might explain the puzzling lack of an association between immune responses and clinical outcomes observed in many trials. For example, a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine with water- in-oil adjuvant has failed to improve survival when Key points Development of vaccines for the treatment of cancer has posed many challenges, but results from some recent studies have confirmed the potential for clinical benefit Progress has been driven by advances in our understanding of cancer immunology and, in particular, the nature and dynamics of the tumour microenvironment Many clinical trials may have failed to adequately account for how vaccines differ from other cancer therapies, and for immunosuppressive mechanisms that operate in the tumour microenvironment Predictive biomarkers that can identify subpopulations of patients most likely to benefit from active immunotherapy are needed Evidence from clinical trials suggest that clinical benefit might be greatest in patients with less advanced stage malignancies Future strategies should include steps to modify the tumour microenvironment to optimize tumour specific immune responses Sir Mac Burnet publishes theory of acquired immunological tolerance169Dendritic cells discovered by Ralph Steinman172IL-2 approved as anti-cancer therapy174 First approval of monoclonal antibody as anti-cancer therapy175 First report of complete/partial regressions with therapeutic cancer vaccine176Burnet proposes theory of immunosurveillance171Discovery of tumour-speci/f_ic antigens in mice by George Klein170 William Coley uses live bacteria as immune stimulant to treat cancer168Discovery of molecularly de/f_ined tumour antigens recognized by human T cells173First approval of therapeutic cancer vaccine50 1997 1973 1949 2010 1998 1991 1957 1992 1967 1893Timeline | Milestones in the development of active immunotherapy REVIEWS \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A single adjuvant is unlikely to result in clinically- relevant antitumour activity and consequently, many active immunotherapies incorporate multiple adjuvants. Vaccines could also incorporate antigens and adjuvants in a delivery vehicle that is immunogenic, such as a recom - binant viral vector or liposomal microspheres. Cultured mature dendritic cells are a type of delivery vehicle with natural adjuvant properties. However, the best source of dendritic cells, the most suitable way to load tumour antigens, the most efficacious regimen to activate and mature the dendritic cells, the best route of adminis - tration and the optimal dosing scheme are debated. In an orthotopic mouse model of head and neck or lung cancer, intranasal (but not intramuscular) immuniza - tion with dendritic cells from the lung parenchyma, but not the spleen, triggered homing properties on induced CD8+ T cells to the mucosa. This process influenced the effectiveness of tumour growth control.18 Importantly, HLA class I presentation of exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells, thereby inducing them to become CTLs (a process called cross-priming) seems to be mainly carried out by specialized dendritic cells, which in humans primarily involve the CD141+ (BDCA -3) and CD103+ subsets.19,20 In addition to their role as antigen-presenting cells, both myeloid and plasmacytoid subsets of natural dendritic cells have been shown to kill tumour cells directly.21 Another promising strategy is to prime the immune system to the target antigen(s) by vaccination with a recombinant viral vector or DNA or mRNA vaccine and then boost with a second vaccine that incorporates the same antigens, but in a different vector (for example, vaccinia viral vector followed by fowlpox viral vector). Such heterologous prime-boost strategies generally pro - vide strong cellular immune responses22 and improved tumour control in preclinical studies.23,24 Very little data are available on how to compare differ - ent adjuvant strategies in humans. The multicomponent nature of active immunotherapies makes their evalu - ation difficult, as effects of adjuvants might vary with immunization schedule, route of administration and immune status.25Lymph node T-cell T-cell expansion2 DC maturation 4 Prolonged CTL activity Figure 2 | Steps in the development of a cellular immune response against tumour associated antigen. Multiple steps and processes are involved in the generation of an immune response directed against tumour antigens, offering multiple opportunities for therapeutic enhancement. For example, immunization can be used to present tumour associated antigens to DCs (1). Tumours can deploy a number of immunosuppressive factors, including TGF and activators of STAT3 phosphorylation, which inhibit DC maturation (2). Small molecule inhibitors of these factors can be used to promote DC maturation and enhance antitumour activity.177-179 Tcell expansion (3) can be supplemented by adoptive transfer of activated antitumour T cells, expanded or genetically modified in culture to recognize tumour antigens.105 Immunostimulatory monoclonal antibodies and cytokines (such as IL 12, IL15, IL 21)182 can also enhance the performance of active immunotherapies or the action of adoptively transferred T cells. Finally, new studies have demonstrated the clinical potential of checkpoint modifiers that interfere with key immunosuppressive mechanisms (such as CTLA4 Tcell receptor; TGF , transforming growth factor ; TH1, type 1 T helper cells; TREG, regulatory T cells.

All rights reserved512 | SEPTEMBER 2014 | VOLUME 11 www.nature.com/nrclinoncOvercoming immune suppression Tumours can escape immune suppression through various mechanisms that are only partially understood. In addition to reduced immunogenicity and antigen loss, tumours often produce excessive amounts of immuno - suppressive mediators as transforming (TGF -) and VEGFA. For example, TGF - inhibits the activation, proliferation and differentiation of T cells,26 and suppresses the activity of CTLs27 and dendritic cells, inducing differentiation of immunosuppressive TREG The cells macrophages. A number of strat egies have been used to deplete these cells in expectation that this will enhance antitumour immune responses. Treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide has been shown to transiently reduce TREG levels and enhance tumour- reactive T -cell responses when used alone29 or in combi - nation with active immunotherapy.30 Other standard therapies, chemotherapies or radiotherapies, or treat - ment with targeted agents can also modify the tumour cell microenvironment. The dynamic relationship between TREG and effector cells is not straightforward or fully understood. Whereas high levels of TREG cells in tumours have been correlated with poor prognosis across a range of cancers,31-33 in a study of TREG infiltration in tumours from patients with colon cancer, higher levels of TREG were found to be associ - ated with better overall survival and progression- free sur - vival (PFS).34 In a phase III study, in which patients with melanoma were randomly assigned to treatment with high dosed of IL-2 either alone or in combination with gp100 peptide vaccine, greater increases in levels of TREG cells were seen in patients who showed a clinical response than in those with no response.35 Therefore, the presence of TREG cells might generally be interpreted as an indication of an ongoing T -cell response against the tumour, and the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses will determine the outcome. Human TREGS include at least two subsets with distinct effects. On the one hand, inducible TREG cells (iTREG) are induced to differentiate in the periphery and mediate tumour-associated immune suppression by contact- independent mechanisms including the production of immunosuppressive factors such as TGF -.36 On the other hand, the natural TREG cells (nTREG)\u2014which are responsible for maintaining self-tolerance and prevent - ing autoimmunity\u2014are produced in the thymus and act through contact-dependent mechanisms.36 Further understanding of TREG characteristics and functions might facilitate selective depletion of TREG subsets. Treatments that target other immunosuppressive cells in the (such as noic acid, sunitinib, gemcitabine and c yclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors, as well as cyclophosphamide) could also enhance the efficacy of active immunotherapy and limit the number and functions of MDSCs.37 Modulation of immune checkpoints Immune checkpoint mechanisms that normally prevent excessive and uncontrolled immune responses operate at the cell surface through lymphocyte inhibitory receptors including, but not limited to, CTLA -4 and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1).38 Similar mechanisms prob - ably also limit the clonal expansion of T cells follow - ing vaccination, providing a rationale for combining vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors. PD -1 is normally transiently induced following immune activation, but chronic antigen exposure, as is the case in cancer, can lead to persistently high levels of PD -1 and T -cell by cells can CTL activity and has been correlated with poor prognosis.40,41 Surface receptors acting as checkpoints are amenable to modulation with m onoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins.42,43 The US approval of ipilimumab for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in March 2011 provided a proof of principle for targeting immune checkpoints in cancer treatment.17 The main mechanism of action relies on releasing effector T cells and possibly on depleting TREG cells in the tumour microenvironment.44 Significant improvements were seen in overall survival in two phase III trials in metastatic melanoma when ipilimu - mab was used alone or in combination with dacarbazine (survival of 11.2 months versus 9.1 months in previously untreated patients; P <0.001)45 or with a gp100 peptide vaccine (survival of 10.0 months versus 6.4 months in Box 1 | Antigens and adjuvants The variety of tumour antigens that are recognized by T cells provides a range of potential targets for active, antigen specific cancer immunotherapy.

In this section, we focus on late-phase clinical studies and newly published data. Prostate cancer As a landmark for active immunotherapy, sipuleucel -T (trade name Provenge \u00ae, Dendreon Corporation, Seattle, USA) was approved in April 2010 by the FDA for the treatment of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and is currently the only FDA-approved therapeutic cancer vaccine. Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cell vaccine prepared by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes from the patient with a recombinant fusion protein incorporating a prostate cancer antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The GM -CSF component facilitates targeting of the PAP antigen to antigen-presenting cells leading to their activation. This procedure is sequentially repeated across three cycles, so that patients are infused with a complex mixture of differ - ent cells and macromolecules including T cells that were activated ex vivo and in vivo by the preceding doses of antigen.49 Therefore, the product is in reality a mixture of a cell vaccine and a form of adoptive T -cell therapy. Approval of sipuleucel -T was based largely on the results of the randomized, double-blind phase III IMPACT trial50 that showed a median overall survival of 25.8 months in patients treated with sipuleucel -T (n = 341) compared with 21.7 months in those treated with placebo ( n = 171), corresponding to a relative reduc - tion of 22% in the risk of death ( P = 0.03). The time to objective disease progression was similar in the two groups (14.6 weeks and 14.4 weeks).50 Sipuleucel -T is currently being tested in prostate cancer as single-agent therapy or in combination with hormone therapy in phase II and III trials (Table 1).51-55 P R O ST VAC \u00ae-VF (also called PSA-TRICOM; Bavarian Nordic, Kvistgaard, Denmark) comprises two recombi - nant viral vectors, each encoding transgenes for PSA, and three immune co-stimulatory molecules, T -lymphocyte antigen associated antigen 3 (LFA -3). A vaccinia-based vector is used for priming followed by boosts with a fowlpox- based vector, both administered with GM -CSF. In a phase II trial, a difference of 8.5 months in overall sur - vival was reported for the vaccine-treated group com - pared with patients with minimally symptomatic CRPC in the control group who were vaccinated with empty vectors.56 A phase III trial is currently ongoing.57Replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vectors are efficient in vivo gene deliv - ery systems and useful adjuvants for the delivery of TAA-coding genes.58 In an ongoing phase II study, patients with newly-recurrent prostate cancer are being treated with Ad5-PSA, either as a stand-alone interven - tion or subsequent to hormone deprivation therapy.59 To date, 100% of patients have developed anti-PSA T-lymphocyte responses. In a second protocol, antigen- specific T -cell responses have been observed in 67% of patients with hormone-refractory disease, who are being treated with Ad5-PSA alone.59 Naked DNA vaccines are generally thought to elicit weaker antitumour immunity than vector-based appro - aches, owing to the absence of a concomitant antiviral inflammatory response. However, early dose-escalation trials encompassing multiple injections of a naked DNA vaccine encoding PAP alongside GM -CSF have demon - strated effective anti-PAP T -cell responses in selected patients with prostate cancer.60 Booster immunizations induced long-term PAP-specific T -lymphocyte responses in a subset of patients achieving a PSA doublin g time of >200%.61 This strategy is now under review in phase II clinical trials in combination with sipuleucel -T and/ or GM -CSF.62,63 In a phase I-IIa study, antigen-specific T-cell responses were reported in 26 of 33 (79%) patients with mCRPC following immunization with mRNAs (CV9103, CureVac) four prostate- specific TAAs.64 Phase IIb of CV910365 and a closely related mRNA vaccine (CV9104)66 are ongoing. GV AX vaccine for prostate cancer (GV AX-PCa) is an active immunotherapy comprising two irradiated allo - geneic prostate cancer cell lines, which constitutively express GM -CSF. Despite early indications of clinical safety and efficacy in patients with mCRPC,67-69 two phase III trials were prematurely terminated owing to lack of therapeutic effect (VITAL -1 trial) and increased mortality (VITAL -2 trial).70,71 Breast cancer A number of HER2-derived peptides have been investi - gated in clinical trials in combination with additional immunostimulatory agents, such as GM -CSF, cyclo - phosphamide or poly-ICLC (also known as Hiltonol; formulation polyriboinosinic polyribo - cytidylic acid [poly I:C]). Active immunotherapy directed against HER2 might have a great benefit only in women with breast tumours that expressed HER2 at low levels. Administration of HER2-derived peptide E75 (also known as NeuVax) alongside GM -CSF in patients at high risk for relapse was shown to prolong disease-free survival (DFS) in a subset of patients who expressed low levels of HER2.72 A phase III clinical trial is currently underway to test the efficacy of E75 with GM -CSF in preventing recurrence in patients with early-stage, node- positive breast cancer and low-to-intermediate HER2 expression.73 A phase II study is also currently ongoing to test the efficacy of combination immunotherapy using the E75 vaccine added to passive immunotherap y with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab.74 REVIEWS \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A single, low dose of cyclophosphamide was administered before the first immunization. Tecemotide failed to signifi cantly prolong survival in the overall popu - lation (with median overall survival of 25.6 months with tecemotide versus 22.3 months with placebo; HR 0.88, P = 0.123).79 However, in a preplanned subgroup analysis for stratification variables, tecemo tide improved survival in patients who had received concurrent chemoradio - therapy (30.8 months versus 20.6 months; HR 0.78, P = 0.016), but not in patients who had received chemo - therapy and radio therapy sequentially.79 A similar phase III trial of tecemotide, INSPIRE,80 is ongoing in Asian patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC81 and a further phase III trial is being initiated in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who have completed c oncurrent c hemoradiotherapy (START2).82 TG4010 vaccine also targets MUC1, but consists of a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding MUC1 and IL2. In a phase II study in 148 patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC, PFS at 6 months was 43% with TG4010 combined with chemotherapy versus 35% with chemotherapy alone (P = 0.3).83 Median overall survival did not differ signifi - cantly between the treatment arms (10.7 months versus 10.3 months; P = 0.59), but there was evidence for a late separation in the survival curves favouring TG4010.83 A phase IIB-III study of TG4010 added to chemo - therapy in around 1,000 patients with stage IV NSCLC is ongoing.84 GSK1572932A is a vaccine that combines a melanoma- associated antigen -3 (MAGE -A3) peptide with the immune adjuvant AS15. Results of a phase II study in 182 patients with resected stage IB-II MAGE -A3-positive NSCLC suggested a trend towards improved outcomes with GSK1572932A compared with placebo, although none of the changes were statistically significant.85 However, a large (around 2,200 patients) phase III study of GSK1572932A after adjuvant chemotherapy for resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (the MAGRIT trial)86 has recently been terminated after it failed to meet its primary end point of extending DFS, as well as proving impossible to identify gene signatures predictive of which patients might benefit from the vaccine therapy.87 Immunization with GV1001\u2014a 16-amino-acid pep - tide vaccine corresponding to the active site of human telo merase reverse transcriptase\u2014and GM -CSF induced specific immune responses in up to 80% of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.88 In a phase II trial, median PFS for patients with a GV1001-specific immune response was 371 days compared with 182 days for non- responders ( P = 0.2). Median overall survival was signifi - cantly longer among immune responders (19.0 months versus 3.5 months for immune nonresponders; P <0.001) in a phase I-II study in which GV1001 was combined with a second telomerase peptide (I540). A phase III study is in development.89 The CIMAvax EGF vaccine is designed to induce an antibody-mediated rather than cell-mediated immune response.

PFS was also significantly longer with the vaccine and IL-2 combina - tion (2.2 months versus 1.6 months; P = 0.008). Median overall survival was 17.8 months with the gp100 vaccine and IL-2 compared with 11.1 months with IL-2 alone (P = 0.06).103 A phase III study of the MAGE -A3 vaccine 2132231A noma (the DERMA trial)100 failed to meet one of its co- primary end points, a prolongation of DFS in the overall MAGE -A3-positive population. The study will continue until the second co-primary end point of DFS in a subset of patients with a gene signature shown to be predictive of response to MAGE -A3 immunotherapy is assessed.104 Adoptive cell therapy with autologous engineered T cells transduced with an anti-MAGE -A3 TCR induced substantial clinical regression in five out of nine patients with late-stage cancer (seven of whom had metastatic melanoma). Three patients experienced neurologi - cal toxicity, which resulted in death of two of them.105 Further investigation suggested that the neurological toxicity is related to previously unrecognized expres - sion of MAGE family antigens in brain tissue. Absence of toxicity with the vaccines might suggest existence of tolerance mechanisms that prevent the presence of high- avidity TCR, such as those used in the adoptive T -cell therapy trial. In patients with metastatic melanoma treated with dendritic cells pulsed and KLH, survival was longer for patients who responded to immunization with a positive CTL response than for non-responders (21.9 months versus 8.1 months) and was longer for immunized patients than non-immunized matched control patients (13.6 months versus 7.3 months).106 In a study of 29 patients with stage III-IV melanoma, loading of both MHC class I and class II epitopes of gp100 and tyrosinase onto dendritic cells enhanced the induction of antitumour responses, which suggested that activation of CD4+ T helper cells could be used to increase cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses.107 Survival was improved compared with matched control patients (PFS of 5.0 months versus 2.8 months, P = 0.0089; overall s urvival of 15.0 months versus 8.3 months, P = 0.089).107 Phase III evaluation of an allogeneic whole-tumour- cell vaccine administered with Bacillus Calmette- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) as adjuvant after resection of metastatic melanoma was terminated early owing to lack of effi - cacy.108 Studies of other allogeneic tumour-cell vaccines are ongoing in this setting.109,110 A study comparing an irradiated, whole-tumour-cell vaccine with a dendritic- cell-based strategy for metastatic melanoma showed significantly longer survival for dendritic-cell-vaccine loaded with autologous antigens compared with immu - nization with the irradiated whole tumour cells (2-year survival of 72% and 31%, P = 0.007).111 In a phase II study of 25 patients with stage III-IV m elanoma, the efficacy of a prime-boost strategy with recombinant NY -ESO -1-expressing poxviruses (vaccinia followed by fowlpox) was of patients with NY -ESO -1-specific CD8+ T cell responses increased from 40% pretreatment to 88% after vaccina - tion. Median overall survival was significantly longer for patients with a post-vaccination immune response than for those without (82 months versus 15 months, P = 0.007). Pancreatic cancer The active immunotherapies that are commonly investi - gated in pancreatic cancer include the telomerase GV1001 and the allogeneic tumour-cell vaccine algenpantucel which is an irradiated combination of two allogeneic pancreatic cancer cell lines transduced with murine alpha -1,3-galatosyltransferase. Two phase III studies with GV1001 were initiated based on promising early-phase trials,112,113 but both studies had disappointing results. One of the studies was terminated early owing to lack of benefit112 and in the other one, no significant sur - vival benefit was seen when GV1001 was given with either concurrent or sequential chemotherapy and the overall response rate with sequential chemo- immunotherapy was lower than that for chemotherapy alone (8.9% versus 17.6%; P = 0.001).113 In a phase II study of a lgenpantucel - L added to adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus 5 - fluorouracil) for resected pancreatic cancer, the overall survival of patients at 1, 2 and 3 years were 86%, 51% and 42%, respectively, suggesting an improvement in survival on the basis of comparison with historical control data.114 Of note, the putative survival benefit with immunotherapy seemed to increase over time, rising from a 37% increase over the expected survival based on historical control data at 1 year to a 121% increase at 3 years. Phase III studies of algenpantucel -L added to the standard of care (chemo - therapy or chemoradiotherapy) for borderline resectable and/or unresectable pancreatic cancer115 and following surgical resection116 are ongoing.

In a phase I-II trial, immunization with synthetic mutant RAS peptides and GM-CSF was assessed in patients with advanced-stage pancreatic cancer ( n = 38) and survival was longer for immune responders compared with non-responders (148 days versus 61 days).117 In a later study of long-term follow-up of 23 patients vaccinated against mutant KRAS following surgical resection for pancreatic adenocarci - noma, an immune response rate of 85% was reported.118 The 10-year survival was 20% in vaccinated patients compared with 0% for a cohort of patients treated without vaccination.118 Colorectal cancer The most widely studied TAA in colorectal cancer (CRC) is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A new adenoviral gene delivery platform encoding the CEA antigen, Ad5 [E1 -, E2b -]-CEA(6D), was shown to induce cell- mediated immunity in 61% of patients with advanced- stage CRC.119 The efficacy of Ad5 vaccines is sometimes limited by pre-existing or induced Ad5-specific neutral - izing antibodies;119 however, overall survival (48%) at 12 months was similar across patients regardless of their pre-existing Ad5 neutralizing antibody titres. Whole-cancer-cell immunotherapies have also shown some promise in CRC. Phase III trials with Onco - VA X\u00ae (Vaccinogen Inc., Maryland, USA), an irradiated, autologous tumour-cell vaccine with BCG adjuvant, in patients with stage I-IV colon cancer, found improve - ments in recurrence-free and overall survival, but largely limited to the patients with stage II disease.120,121 A con - firmatory phase IIIb trial has been requested by the FDA and is due to begin in patients undergoing resection of stage II-CRC.122 In a new phase II trial, survival was assessed in patients who were disease-free after CRC metastasectomy and perioperative chemotherapy, and who received autolo - gous dendritic cells modified with a poxvector encoding CEA and MUC1 (known as PANV AC).123 Recurrence- free survival of 47% at 2 years was similar to that in patients receiving PANV AC plus GM -CSF (55%). Survi - val for all vaccinated patients was longer than survival for a comparator group of patients who did not receive active immunotherapy.123 Renal cell carcinoma Active immunotherapies in development for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) include AGS -003, a personalized therapy comprising autologous dendritic cells trans - fected with patient-specific tumour and a synthetic, truncated human CD40 ligand (CD40L). In a phase II study in patients with newly diagnosed meta - static RCC with an unfavourable prognosis, AGS -003 therapy was combined with the tyrosine kinase inhibi - tor sunitinib.124 Median PFS was 11.2 months and median overall survival was 30.2 months, exceeding the values expected from historical data.124 A phase III clinical trial is currently assessing AGS -003 when added to standard of care treatment with sunitinib for advanced RCC.125 IMA901 vaccine consists of nine peptides derived from antigens overexpressed in RCC. In a phase II study, overall survival of patients with metastatic RCC who had not responded to previous therapy with cytokines or VEGF-inhibitors was 67% when receiving a combi - nation treatment of cyclophosphamide and IMA901 plus GM -CSF, and GM-CSF cyclophosphamide - istered 3 days before IMA901 plus GM -CSF was shown to reduce the number of TREGS and improve overall sur - vival in patients with multiepitope T -cell responses to IMA901, but had no survival benefit in patients with no immune response.12 In a phase III trial of IMA901 in combination with sunitinib in metastatic RCC, scien - tists have completed recruiting patients and the study is c urrently in follow-up.126Box 2 | Key issues in implementing active immunotherapy in clinical practice Clinical trial end points Clinical studies should take into account that the relation of dose to efficacy and safety might not be proportional, and that the optimal therapeutic dose might not be the maximum tolerated dose Trial design needs to reflect that clinical effects might take substantially longer to develop than with established anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and might not involve substantial reductions in tumour size Immunotherapeutic trials should incorporate new measures of antitumour effects on the basis of assessment of immune response patterns Multimodality treatment Rationale exists for combinations of active immunotherapies with debulking surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, signal transduction inhibitors, adoptive Tcell therapy, cytokines, antivascular agents, immunostimulatory antibodies and inhibitors of immunosuppression Studies of active immunotherapy in combination with other treatment modalities should be pursued as a high priority, given the potential for synergistic enhancements Careful consideration of safety is essential before combining treatments in clinical studies, particularly the potential role for complex interactions in shaping an immune response Patient selection Active immunotherapy might be most effective in early stage or indolent disease and when tumour growth is controlled Diagnostic assessments that provide detailed information of immune functions should be identified and their correlations with clinical responses to active immunotherapy should be determined Preliminary evidence suggests that parameters that might act as markers of immune responsiveness relevant to active immunotherapy including tumour specific T cells and autoantibodies as well as immune cell subpopulations (such as dendritic cells, T cell subsets including TREG cells, macrophages) and chemokines in the circulation and tumour microenvironment should be included Treatments to overcome tumour associated immunosuppression and restore responsiveness to active immunotherapy should be pursued Use of suitable adjuvants Identification of the optimal combinations of antigens, adjuvants and delivery vehicles is an important priority to maximize the effectiveness of active immunotherapy Immunotherapy development must consider that adjuvant effects can vary according to factors including dose, immunization schedule, antigen, route of administration and host immune status Prime boost strategies should be assessed when developing active immunotherapies Abbreviation: TREG, regulatory T cell.

In a phase II study, in which a WT1 peptide was administered with GM -CSF and KLH as adjuvants, 10 of 17 patients with untreated, relapsed, or refrac - tory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) had an objec - tive response of stable disease, and four more patients had a clinical response after an initial period of disease progression.127 High blast levels were associated with reduced immunogenicity, suggesting that efficacy is greater in patients with minimal residual disease. In a phase I-II study of 10 patients with AML in haema - tological remission after chemotherapy, five patients had normalization of WT1 mRNA expression levels follow ing immunization with dendritic cells loaded with full-length WT1 protein.128 Two of these five patients improved from partial to complete remission following vaccination, and clinical responses were correlated with induction of WT1 -specific CD8+ T cell responses.128 Anti-idiotype vaccines have been successful in some studies of follicular lymphoma, despite demonstrating weak immunogenicity in multiple adjuvant prolonged median DFS by 13.5 months ( P = 0.047) in a phase III study of patients with follicular lymphoma with a complete response after chemotherapy.130 Specific immune responses in most patients (61%) following anti-idiotypic vacci nation correlated with improved DFS in a series of 33 patients with a complete second response to chemotherapy after first relapse of follicular lymphoma. The dura - tion of the second complete response was longer than the first complete response for immune responders, but was shorter than the first complete response for non- responders.131 Other phase III multicentre trials that have not yet been published have yielded negative results. The apparent minimal efficacy of anti-idiotype vaccines and the develop ment of next-generation B -cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies have reduced the interest in anti-idiotype approaches for indolent lymphoma. MUC1-specific immunotherapy with tecemotide was assessed in a phase II trial in 34 patients with previously untreated, slowly-progressive, asymptomatic multiple myeloma or stage II-III myeloma in stable or plateau phase following antitumour therapy.132 Induction of MUC1-specific immune responses was seen in nearly half of the patients. No objective clinical response was noted, but the paraprotein concentration was reduced over time in 13 of 29 patients, predominantly in those patients with early-stage disease. Implications for clinical practice The experience from clinical trials of active immuno - therapies highlights the potential efficacy of this therapy in the treatment of cancer and identifies a number of key issues that need to be addressed if this potential is to be achieved (Box 2). Firstly, active immunotherapies are recog nized to work in different ways from chemothera - pies and this difference needs to be taken into account in the design and interpretation of clinical studies.133 Whereas chemotherapy has an essentially immedi - ate onset of action, a full immune response to active immunotherapy can take several months to develop. Furthermore, chemotherapy usually involves the direct action of an agent on its target, whereas active immuno - therapy acts indirectly by engaging an immune system, in which many components can have different effects in differ ent situ ations. Consequently, the proportional pharmacodynamic relationships among the treatment dose, efficacy and toxi city, which are typical of chemo - therapy, do not apply to many immunotherapies, and the optimal biological dose is often not the maximum tolerated dose. Patient selection As with other targeted therapies, only a minority of patients currently benefit from active immunotherapy but, for some patients, the benefits might be substantial. Patient selection is therefore an important issue. Initial assessments of active immunotherapies have generally Box 3 | Rationale for combination of active immunotherapy with other treatments Combination with debulking surgery Reduce tumour mediated immunosuppression183 and quantity of malignant tissue to eradicate Active immunotherapy likely to be more effective in patients with minimal residual disease184 Combination with radiotherapy Modify the tumour microenvironment185 Induce immunogenic cell death and release of tumour antigens Enhance tumour infiltration by effector T cells186 Immune activating activity of local radiotherapy might contribute to abscopal effects187 Combination with chemotherapy cell death188 frequencies147 Enhance Tcell signal transduction inhibitors (such as rapamycin) Potentiate vaccine induced generation of memory T cells190 Increase susceptibility to cytotoxic effector cells191 Combination with adoptive Tcell transfer Prime T cells and amplify antitumour immune responses192 Combination with cytokines Enhance cellular immune responses through a variety of mechanisms Can include combination with GMCSF, IL 2, IL12, IL 15, IL 21 Combination with monoclonal antibody antagonists of immune checkpoints (such as antiCTLA4, anti PD1) Block key mechanisms that downregulate T cell immune responses193 Combination with monoclonal antibody agonists of co stimulatory pathways Promote Tcell survival and proliferation (such as OX40 or CD137) Enhance antigen presentation and Tcell activation (such as CD40)181 Combination with small molecule inhibitors of tumour mediated immunosuppression Reversal of tumour induced immunosuppression mediated by transforming growth factor .

However, rapid tumour growth and extensive tumour-related immunosuppression suggest that these patients might be least likely to benefit from this treatment. In a number of clinical studies in which active immunotherapy failed to prolong survival in the intention-to-treat population, subgroup analyses suggested clinical benefits in patients with early-stage or relatively indolent disease.120,134-136 The potential benefit of using predictive biomarkers for patient selection is discussed below, but with regards to treatment with single active immunotherapies, patients with less-advanced disease are more likely to benefit.137 Immunotherapy in multimodal treatment People with more-advanced malignancies might require active immunotherapy to be combined with chemo - therapies, other immunotherapies and/or other immune- enhancing interventions in order to gain meaning ful benefit (Box 3). Repeated exposure to tumour antigens is necessary, but not sufficient, to demonstrate therapeu - tic benefit. Through the combination of active immuno - therapy with other antitumour and immune-modulating treatments, other immune-activating mechanisms such as appropriate dendritic-cell maturation, T -cell e xpansion and relief of tumour-associated immune suppression, which are key events to mount a robust antitumour immune response, could be possible.Many investigators have proposed a beneficial effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy on immune response func - tions. Studies have shown that tumour cell death eliciting endoplasmic reticulum stress and release of molecules such as alarmins during unprogrammed cell death is immunogenic.138 This mechanism might depend on pro- inflammatory effects and the release of a wide range of tumour-specific antigens amenable to cross- presentation by dendritic cells. Furthermore, mouse experiments sug - gest that immune-mediated effects are important to the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and data in humans support this hypothesis.139-141 Chemo - therapy can modify the phenotype and function of T -cell populations; for example, by decreasing the number of TREG or depleting the existing Chemotherapy-induced enhances static antigen-independent proliferation of naive lympho - cytes by removing competition for survival factors such as IL7 and IL15.144 Chemotherapy also affects the MDSC pool,145 modifying the profile of chemokines and/or growth factors in the vicinity of the tumour.146 Clinical evi - dence shows that chemotherapy could suppress immune inhibitory mechanisms in the tumour microenviron - ment.147,148 Combinations of immunotherapies together with tumour-specific chemotherapies are currently being evaluated,149,150 and combinations of radiotherapy and immunotherapy have shown promising results in early -phase clinical studies.151,152 Monoclonal antibodies neutralizing inhibitory -417,45 and anti- PD-1/PDL -142,46,48 are in phase III clinical development either as monotherapy or in combination with standard of care. Such antibodies have shown evidence of synergy with cancer vaccines in mouse models,153,154 and clinical results155,156 suggest a potential for the combinations. Other potential approaches to enhancing responses to active immunotherapy include ablation or reprogram - ming of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), which have a key role in maintaining the immunosuppressive milieu of the tumour microenvironment. CSF -1 seems to be a key mediator of tumour invasion and metastasis.157 Elevated circulating levels of CSF -1 and high levels of expression of CSF -1 have been correlated with poor sur - vival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer,158 and breast adenocarcinomas,159 respectively. In a new study, CSF -1-positive macrophage stromal responses were associated with high tumour grade and lymphovascu - lar invasion of endometrial carcinomas.160 Monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block signal ling through the CSF -1 receptor, and thus deplete macrophages,161 have been shown to enhance antitumour immunity and infiltration of CTLs in response to chemo - therapy in preclinical models.162 Depletion of TAMs in human mammary adenocarcinoma tissue was shown to promote CD8+ cytotoxic cell infiltration and enhance anti - tumour immunity. Monoclonal antibodies against CSF -1 and CSF-1R are under clinical investigation in a range of different tumour types.163 Chemokine receptor antago - nists might also have potential as anticancer therapies to prevent tumour i nfiltration by cells.164Biobank from /uni25A0 Others Retrospective tests in patients treated with immunotherapy Predictive biomarker candidates /uni25A0 Unique biomarker /uni25A0 Algorithm Prospective validation in clinical trial Routine use in patient selection and validation Figure 3 | Roadmap to the development of predictive biomarkers for active immunotherapy. The goal of developing predictive biomarkers is to select the patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular intervention. Potential biomarkers might be identified through a rationale or discovered serendipitously. For cancer immunotherapy, parameters measured in tumour biopsies might be of particular importance in predicting responses to immunotherapy, given the importance of the tumour microenvironment in modifying immune responses. Any potential biomarker must first be validated retrospectively. Promising candidates, either unique biomarkers or algorithms incorporating multiple predictive parameters, can then be optimised. Only after predictive power has been prospectively demonstrated in clinical trials can the biomarker be reliably applied to routine clinical practice.

All rights reserved520 | SEPTEMBER 2014 | VOLUME 11 www.nature.com/nrclinoncPredictive biomarkers As mentioned earlier, patient selection is an important issue and biomarkers that provide an early indication of response or are predictive of clinical benefit are needed as a priority. Possibly, no single immune biomarker will prove adequate and algorithms that incorporate multi - ple biomarkers will be needed (Figure 3). The RAIDs (Rational molecular Assessment Innovative Drug Selec - tion) project,165 for example, is taking a multidisci plinary approach genomic studies, protein arrays, viral genotyping and immunohistochemical investiga - tions in an attempt to identify the best option of targeted therapy for patients with cervical cancer. A diverse variety of potential biomarkers exists. Pre - treatment circulating levels of proteins, DNA, tumour cells and immune cells are easy to assess, but levels in the tumour microenvironment are likely to be better predic - tors of response. Assessments of immune responses both before and on-treatment might also prove valuable in predicting long-term outcomes. Pretreatment screening of patients for the presence of target TAAs is clearly important. However, it should be considered that\u2014owing to epitope spreading\u2014antigens other than the specified TAA might be important deter - minants of efficacy.166 Sequencing of the whole genome of each tumour to identify unique, mutation-derived antigens could allow a choice of tumour antigens that is truly personalized for optimal immunogenicity and clinical efficacy.167 Circulating biomarkers that correlate with tumour burden might predict response to immuno - therapy, given that immunotherapy seems to be most effective in patients with early-stage or indolent disease. For example, lower baseline PSA levels have been shown to correlate with greater survival in patients with prostate cancer treated with sipuleucel -T.136 Gene and immune signatures are likely to be more insightful in assessing the function of a complex network such as the immune system, and would be expected to be more effective in predicting outcomes than single parameters. For example, a newly identified signature of 84 genes mostly associated with immune-related func - tions can predict response to MAGE -A3 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma.104 Conclusions Active immunotherapy is emerging as an important addi - tion to conventional cancer treatments, but many impor - tant questions remain. Optimal combinations of antigens, adjuvants and delivery vehicles need to be determined and effective strategies for overcoming tumour-associated immunosuppression should be developed. Combinations of complementary immunotherapies are clearly needed to induce robust and sustained antitumour responses, and this progress needs to be reflected in both industry- sponsored and investigator-initiated clinical develop - ment programmes. Extensive efforts must be made in the identifi cation of new predictive biomarkers and their prospective validation in the real-life clinical setting. Review criteria A search for original articles published between 2000 and 2014 and focusing on therapeutic cancer vaccines was carried out in MEDLINE and PubMed. The search terms used were \"cancer\" and \"vaccine\" and \"immunotherapy\", alone and in combination. All articles identified were English language, full text papers. We also searched the abstracts for key scientific congresses (such as ASCO and ESMO) over the past 5 years. References were also supplemented with key references from the authors' personal libraries. We would to like to apologize to colleagues for not including interesting research in early clinical trials and preclinical models, but this was outside the intended scope of the paper and was not possible given limitations on space. 1.
