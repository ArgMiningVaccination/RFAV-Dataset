The book exposes the underlying rational of somatic art therapy, covering art therapy effectiveness, Levine's somatic dissociation, van der Kolk's somatic memory, and Scaer's procedural memory concepts.

It's like reading a love story in which there are multiple encounters between \"Theory\" and \"Practice\". Johanne Hamel is extremely successful in creating a connection between \"Theory\" and \"Practice\", using her own examples from her art psychotherapy practice of many years. -Jo Sughondhabirom, MD, RCAT, International Program of Art Therapy in Thailand Johanne Hamel has expanded the healing potential of Art Therapy by incorporating somatic processing, providing her students and clients with the opportunity to gain a deeper awareness about the mind-body connection in emotional healing and wellbeing. As a somatic art therapist, Johanne Hamel developed a 6-days intensive workshop in Somatic art therapy and now she has provided us with this valuable text on Somatic art therapy, first published in French and now in English. Although, releasing trauma from the body may not be a new concept in the field of mental health, blending art therapy interventions with somatic processing in trauma treatment is a promising new concept in the field of Art Therapy. -From the Foreword, Lucille Proulx, MA, ATR, RCAT, executive director, CiiAT- The Canadian International Institute of Art Therapy.
