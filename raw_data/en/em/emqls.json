In addition, the Metabolic syndrome is now also highly correlated to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), the leading cause of cirrhosis today. Overwhelming epidemiological and physiological evidence exists that correlate an elevated serum uric acid to every aspect of the Metabolic Syndrome (Blood pressure, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity). The mechanism of how uric acid induces fatty liver, insulin resistance, and all the metabolic sequelae is biochemically related to sugar consumption. Historically the rise of the obesity rates parallels the rise in the consumption of sugar and has accelerated with the addition of high fructose corn syrup. Humans and primates are the only mammals that suffer from metabolic syndrome and also have 5- 10 times higher uric acid levels than other mammals. The genetic origin of this difference originated 15 million years ago in the Miocene period astonishingly as a genetic mutation that during that period was the survival advantage for our biological ancestors. Dark cherries have been used to treat gout for decades. There is now abundant evidence using dark cherry extract, from specific cultivars, that significantly normalize blood pressure, lipids and glucose. Dark cherries show great promise as a natural alternative for treating these common conditions. We will review the current evidence including dosage and pharmacokinetics.

Many people sustain complex pains for many years with no relief. Hypothesis: Using three models to treat pain, conventional medicine uses the understanding of the nervous system, and modern Chinese medicine uses the understanding of the meridian system. The third system uses the understanding of the path of least resistance. Since Qi flows or migrates in the body, an electrical system was used. Having two parallel resistors in a low voltage circuit with one resistor slightly larger than the other, the current would flow more in the circuit with lesser resistance. When one of the resistance is very much larger than the other, the circuit with the larger resistance becomes an open circuit i.e. no current flows through that circuit. Depending on the variance of the pain, the corrective Qi/energy would find the path of least resistance. Objective: To use a non-invasive method to reduce/eliminate pain in any part of the body, by targeting the brain using specific points on the head. Methods: Experimental Procedure 1: The administer applies pressure on a point on the head of the subject to remove pain from a distal part of the body of that subject. This is done by randomly using different points until the right point is used, and then, the pain would reduce instantly. Experimental Procedure 2: A continuity monitor was used with the negative probe on the site of injury, and the positive probe was close to the specific point on the head of the subject. The positive probe was moved around within an area called the module until the specific point to the injury was reached. The pain would reduce instantly. Conclusion: This kind of treatment requires knowledge of the landscape of the head, and precision with two millimeters tolerance.

The main reason is usually the slowness of material passing through the colon or problem in excretion. One particular method is through lifestyle changes - including dietary changes that can help alleviate symptoms. The aim of the present study was to treat constipation by combining the extract of medicinal plants of Plantago, Roses, and Manna of Hedysarum in a short period of time and without complications after treatment. This quasi-experimental study was performed on 30 women aged 20-50 years old who referred to the Iranian Institute of Colorectal Research, which had functional constipation. After diagnosis, patients were treated with constipation. Patients with chronic constipation, who were not -treated with a common diet and who were long-term dependent on laxative chemical pills. In this article, laxatives and laxatives of medicinal plants and medicinal plants are defined according to the characteristics mentioned in the sources of traditional medicine, such as Ibn Sina's Law. By identifying the effective ingredients of Plantago, Roses and Manna of Hedysarum, including glucose and tannins, comarins, flavonoids, quercetin, determining the appropriate dosage, and combining and extracting these three herbs according to the traditional text and oral administration of 30 women 20 to 50 years old. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the extracts of Plantago, Rose, and Manna of Hedysarum, due to their chemical compounds, are effective in improving the constipation of 90% of patients.

However, its protective effect against Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) has not been fully clarified. The study was planned to elucidate the possible protective mechanisms of MF20 and its nano-formulation (NMF10) against mesenteric I/R-induced MODS. Methodology: Male Wister rats were allocated into 2 sets. In the first set, animals were treated with MF (20 mg/kg, i.p) or NMF (10 mg/kg, i.p), or the vehicle for 3 days before I/R, which was induced by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 30 minutes followed by declamping for 60 minutes. In the second set, animals were treated with NMF (10 mg/kg, i.p or MLA and NMF or atropine and NMF or the vehicle for 3 days before I/R. Results: MF20 and NMF10 antioxidant effect was evidenced by increasing contents of TAC and normalizing that of MDA while NMF10 elevated m-RNA levels of NRF-2 and HO-1 as well as GST. The mechanistic studies revealed that both forms protected the 3 organs studied, viz., liver, kidney and intestine partly via increasing the content of -catenin along with decreasing that of GSK-3, whereas NMF10 decreased the phosphorylated NF- B-p65 along the anti-inflammatory effect, MF20 and NMF10 reduced IL-1, effect that were mirrored on the tissue contents of MPO, IL-6 and MMP-9. Moreover, NMF10 possessed anti-apoptotic character evidenced by elevating Bcl-2 content and reducing that of caspase-3. In the serum, intestinal I/R increased the activity of ALT, AST, and CK. In all the measured parameters, NMF10 showed promise over MF20, however, these protective effects were deterred by the presence of atropine but not MLA. Conclusion: The intimated protective mechanisms of MF20 and NMF10 against MODS progression are mediated via the involvement of Wnt/-catenin/NF-/ PPAR- and Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathways with contribution of muscarinic receptors.

A prospective clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of a topical cream containing 0.5% Aleppo oak oil in the treatment of chronic anal fissures, in patients who were not treated with common anti-fissure creams. The Aleppo oak cream was applied by the patients to the wound site 3 times per day for 6 weeks following the instructions of a physician. The pain was assessed with a visual analog scale before treatment and at the end of each week of treatment. Wound healing and the amount and severity of bleeding were examined and evaluated before and at the end of each week of treatment. There were statistically significant differences in chronic anal fissure pain, hemorrhaging upon defection and wound healing before and at the end of the first week of treatment also in comparison with control group (p < 0.0001). In this study, a topical cream containing Aleppo oak oil was an effective treatment for chronic anal fissures. This is a promising result indicating that further comparative studies are justified.

Researches have supported that women with great physical and mental stress have disturbed menses. Female life is divided into 3 phases. Firstly, birth to puberty, secondly, puberty to adult, thirdly, menopause or climacteric. Hence girls should be given proper diet, routine health checkups. Women suffering with acne, dysmenorrhoea, PCOD, regular U.T.I need proper treatments. Majority of the females don't visit a doctor due to ignorance, or unawareness of the disease, some cannot afford the expenses, in some families women health is not taken seriously. The purpose of this study is to provide awareness about women's health and the homeopathic treatment that helps in curing the disease. When a women experience no relief from external treatments, a homeopathic remedy, to balance the vital force will help the particular infection. But if the symptoms tend to reoccur or seem to be part of poor health or low immunity than a constitutional remedy based on totality of symptoms is to be considered. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: The study was done to find the utility of homeopathic medicines in patients suffering from menorrhagia, UTI, pcod, hot flushes etc. some of the women suffering from mental stress were counseled. Case taking was done on the basis of principles of homeopathy through repertorization. Findings: Many patients were treated and cured. Homoeopathic tox, causticum cured cases of fibroid uterus, PCOD, dysmennorhoea, etc. 47% patients showed history of stress while 20% had family history. Constitutional remedies like tuberculinum, Natrum Mur etc were given. Conclusion & Significance: Women suffering with health problems need help. Homeopathic medicines help in curing them both physically and also the mental symptoms were considered in each case taking. Repolarization help in finding the most simillimum medicine that cures a patient completely. 0.5% of the patients remained untreated as they discontinued their treatments. Biography Sandhya Khanna is a homeopathic doctor practicing since 2011. She has her expertise in treating cases through homeopathic case taking and repertorization. She has made this data after years of hard work and research while treating patients. She has good clinical and therapeutic knowledge, providing assistance to the patient through homeopathic medicine. She has good communication skill that helped in collecting proper and correct data from the patients and this helped in curing cases. Hence a different approach was made to diagnose a disease and treating them. sandhyakapoor999@gmail.comSandhya Khanna, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 & Integrative Medicine | ISSN: 2327-5162 | Volume 7Natural, Traditional & Alternative Medicine September 24-25, 2018 | Montreal, Canada3rd International Conference and Expo onBody wisdom: Partnership of humanity, nature and the global brain Mary Elizabeth Swaine Intuitive Energetics, Canada Statement of the Problem: Most people do not understand the wisdom of their bodies. When the body experiences pain or disease, most people hit the panic button, instead of realizing that the body is trying to make them aware of something they need to know to both evolve and be happier. They make decisions about treatments based on fear, the desire to avoid the experience rather than benefit from it, or on the mistaken idea that getting rid of the symptoms gets rid of the underlying cause. Mary's presentation will clarify the following aspects of body wisdom: Multi-level awareness 35 senses Physical sensations Body is evolution's bottom line The wisdom of disease Body is hologram of all human beings, groups, the planet itself The humor of the body Why do so many of us not listen to our body's wisdom?

The concentration of glucose in blood and perfused solution was determined with picric acid method by intensity of colour reaction on spectrofotometer. Concentration of hormones (insulin, C-peptide) was defined by immunoenzyme method with standard sets on tablet spectrofotometer. The morphological structure of a pancreas was studied by a method of light microscopy. Content of glycogen in a liver was measured by means of SHICK-reaction on the Mac-Manus method with measurement of colouring intensity on spectrofotometer. The intake of the turmeric rhizomes in rats with diabetes, as compared with the same animals on a standard diet, resulted in the lower increasing of the glucose concentration in blood, the decrease of glucose absorption in the gut, higher concentration of the insulin and C-peptide in plasma and significant increase of glycogen level in the liver. The microstructure of pancreatic tissue samples of experimental animals using turmeric was characterized by the better preservation of the islet apparatus in comparison with a group of animals on a standard diet. The results indicate the positive effect of the Curcuma longa rhizomes on the homeostatic mechanisms of the carbohydrate metabolism regulation in the alloxan-induced diabetic rats.

Hypothesis: Regulation of the prefrontal cortex can eliminate pain-belief, and memory. When the prefrontal cortex is regulated, positive and corrective energy/Qi can be sent from the brain to the site of injury and returning it to homeostasis. Their several paths this energy/Qi can take. Method: Experimental Procedure: Path of least resistance. In this study, 128 subjects of diverse backgrounds and pains were used. Step 1: Regulation of the prefrontal cortex. Since test subjects are all different, the objective is to get the subject into a hypo/ relaxed state. Several ways are used. Step 2: Next, the most efficient and effective pathway(s) from the brain to the site of injury was located. A continuity monitor was used for this purpose.Step 3: An augmented was applied to the head, and this allowed the energy stimulated by the former to flow to the site of pain. This energy released the pain and reduced inflammation. Conclusion: Since the brain is the control tower of the body, the most effective pathway for brain/ pain connection is a definitive way to resolve most pain.

TM should be subjected to rigorous research for their efficacy and safety for better health care. When developing novel drugs using TM candidates it is essential to consider novel standard parameters. Quality control of TM is also prerequisite of standard clinical trials. It is necessary to follow current standard quality controlling methods viz Good Laboratory Practice (GLP); Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP); Good Clinical Practice (GCP); Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) or Pharmaceutical Quality. World Health Organization (WHO) has published guidelines for safety issues in herbal product development. According to this categorization it is required to be addressed safety and toxicity before clinical usage of TM. In general research on TM should be followed by the same ethical requirements as all research related to human participants. According to WHO Operational Guidance, Information Needed to Support Clinical Trials of Herbal Products (OG-CTHP) declared that Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers are generally unnecessary for most herbal medicines if their substantial prior human use conveys reasonable confidence that these regimens can safely be administered to small numbers of carefully monitored clinical participants in phase 2 trials. Crucial stipulation of the OG-CTHP is that, notwithstanding historical evidence of safety, in both phase 2 clinical trials with small numbers of participants and large phase 3 trials, safety of participants should be assured by a comprehensive literature review as well as by specified protocol provisions.
