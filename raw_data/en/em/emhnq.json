Plant-derived agents in specific doses affect the body's non-specific, antigen-independent defense system. They have immunostimulatory effects on the entire immune regulatory system. They can enhance the immune response through various factors such as macrophages, leukocytes, and granulocytes, as well as through mediators released by the cellular immune system. This paper was inspired by the threats caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proper functioning of the immune system is important in limiting the effects of viral infection and restoring the normal functioning of the body. This paper also emphasizes the importance of the skillful use of plant immunostimulants by potential patients, but also by those who prescribe drugs. It is important not only to choose the right plant drug but above all to choose the correct dose and duration of treatment.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-25", "cleaned_text": "Use of 12 Medicinal Plant Species and Their Bioactive Compounds Affecting the Immune System [https://doi.org/10.3390/app13116477](https://doi.org/10.3390/app13116477) [Bioactive Compounds from Natural Products - Volume II]( /journal/applsci/special_issues/Bioactive_Product )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-applsci-13-06477), [2](#B2-applsci-13-06477)]. In the past 30 years, a significant increase in new \"natural\" medicines developed as very effective drugs has been observed [ [3](#B3-applsci-13-06477)]. Plant constituents, due to their great biological and structural diversity, are a unique and renewable source for the discovery of new natural medicines. Identified phytochemicals, including polysaccharides, lactones, glycosides, terpenoids, and alkaloids, have been reported to be primarily responsible for the immunomodulation activity of plants. The stimulation of the body's defense mechanism has been proven to be an effective approach to counteracting viral and bacterial infections [ [1](#B1-applsci-13-06477)]. Herbal preparations, including those using plant extracts, are widely known and increasingly used due to their significant immunostimulant properties [ [4](#B4-applsci-13-06477)]. Immunomodulators, defined as helpful compounds which are derived naturally from plants, have been proven to fight against invaders by producing antibodies as well as by maintaining the homeostasis of the immune system [ [5](#B5-applsci-13-06477)]. The most common and important causes of reduced immunity are chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy, cooling of the organism, alcohol abuse, recurrent infections, poor diet, and recurrent COVID-19 [ [6](#B6-applsci-13-06477), [7](#B7-applsci-13-06477), [8](#B8-applsci-13-06477)]. The terms immunostimulants and immunomodulators are used interchangeably in phytotherapy for plant materials that affect the immune system. Both define non-specific stimulatory therapy, which consists of stimulation of the defense system, manifested by a specific humoral response (stimulation of B lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulins) and the so-called cellular response (stimulation of T lymphocytes to produce macrophages and granulocytes, among others) and/or modulation of the autonomic nervous system to restore the normal, natural functions of the body [ [9](#B9-applsci-13-06477), [10](#B10-applsci-13-06477)]. Its central element is the activation of macrophages\u2014cells produced by the bone marrow that primarily stimulate the process of phagocytosis [ [11](#B11-applsci-13-06477)]. They are also responsible for releasing numerous substances with vast biological properties affecting the immune system, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) and interleukins (IL). TNF- (tumor necrosis factor) is a protein substance involved in the immune response and inflammatory process [ [12](#B12-applsci-13-06477)]. Essential biological functions of the factor are stimulation of B, T, and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes, stimulation of the immune response to the presence of tumor cells by affecting apoptosis (programmed cell death process), and inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells [ [13](#B13-applsci-13-06477)]. The stimulus for its production is also provided by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, interleukin 1, and -interferon (IFN). More recently, the possibility of TNF influencing the regeneration of nerve cells in the brain has been identified. However, it should be noted that negative aspects of this factor\u2014induction of tumor cell proliferation and enhancement of the inflammatory process\u2014are also suggested. For this reason, great caution should be exercised against compounds that contribute to increased secretion of the TNF factor [ [14](#B14-applsci-13-06477)]. Interleukins (IL) are cytokines involved in the inflammatory process, with a broad spectrum of action. IL-1 affects the formation of B and T lymphocytes (specific immune response). IL-6 stimulates B lymphocytes formation and inhibits TNF reflux. anti-inflammatory cytokine, quinquefolii radix. Polysaccharides in these plant raw materials increase the number of lymphocytes and sensitize foreign substances to the effect of phagocytosis (opsonization) [ [19](#B19-applsci-13-06477)]. [20](#B20-applsci-13-06477)]. They affect the division and stimulation of the activity of B and T lymphocytes, the phagocytic activity of leukocytes, and the synthesis of immunoglobulins and interferon [ [21](#B21-applsci-13-06477), [22](#B22-applsci-13-06477)]. The immunostimulatory effect of parenterally administered glycoproteins occurs after minimal doses\u20141 ng/kg body weight. Larger doses can cause an immunosuppressive effect and are used in transplants to prevent rejection by the immune system [ [23](#B23-applsci-13-06477)]. Some anti-tumor raw materials and plant compounds have an immunostimulatory mechanism of action. Among them, alkaloids) [ [24](#B24-applsci-13-06477)] species of fungi, such as Schizophyllan commune [ [25](#B25-applsci-13-06477)], can be mentioned. 2. Materials and Methods 3. Plant Raw Materials and Compounds with Proven Immune-Enhancing Effects the postulated molecular mechanisms of action of plant-derived immunomodulators is presented. 3.1.1. Pharmacological Properties [26](#B26-applsci-13-06477), [40](#B40-applsci-13-06477)]. The juice of fresh purple coneflower herb at a concentration of 5 to 500 g/mL stimulated the incorporation of labeled 1H-thymidine, whereas the concentration exceeding 2500 g/mL caused its suppression. The same preparation inhibited the intrusion of influenza, Herpes-type viruses, and oral mucosal viruses into isolated animal cells. Moreover, the increased globulin levels after intraperitoneal administration as well as the stimulated leukocytosis and granulocytosis by 55% were observed in vivo [ [27](#B27-applsci-13-06477)]. [41](#B41-applsci-13-06477)]. [42](#B42-applsci-13-06477)]. [43](#B43-applsci-13-06477)]. However, it should be noted that coneflower herb can be contaminated with mold and common mycotoxins, which has been recently reported [ [44](#B44-applsci-13-06477)]. [45](#B45-applsci-13-06477)]. 3.1.2. Safety of Use [26](#B26-applsci-13-06477), [39](#B39-applsci-13-06477)]. Preparations of purple coneflower herb are well tolerated, but there is a risk of sensitization, triggering an allergic reaction in people with atopic diseases. There may be side effects associated with autoimmune diseases and leukopenia (when used for longer than 8 weeks). Deterioration of disease symptoms or a sudden increase in temperature during treatment with purple coneflower herb preparations should be addressed with a doctor or pharmacist. No adverse effects have been reported during pregnancy in women and born children, but the drug should not be administered without consulting the doctor [ Use [52](#B52-applsci-13-06477)]. The plant material should not be administered for more than 8 weeks during one year [ [53](#B53-applsci-13-06477)]. 3.3. In clinical trials, patients with flu-like symptoms treated with the extract equivalent to 900 mg of dry crude had a statistically significant effect compared to the placebo group on such cold symptoms as shoulder and limb pains, headache, and weakness. In addition, the administration of the extract resulted in a shorter recovery period for patients with the aforementioned cold symptoms. These studies indicate that the raw material can be used as an auxiliary agent in preventing and treating upper respiratory tract infections and the common cold [ [55](#B55-applsci-13-06477)]. 3.3.2. Safety of Use [29](#B29-applsci-13-06477)]. [56](#B56-applsci-13-06477)]. The raw material should be used for at least 8 weeks in the year [ [57](#B57-applsci-13-06477)]. Mill. 3.5.1. Pharmacological Properties [61](#B61-applsci-13-06477)]. In another animal study, various parameters of immune, cellular, and humoral responses were investigated in mice following the administration of an aqueous extract originating from the greenhouse cultivation of Aloe arborescens in Poland. The preparation exerted a stimulatory effect on the migratory activity of mouse splenocytes, the chemiluminescent activity of mouse blood granulocytes, and the production of anti-SRBC antibodies. It stimulated the cutaneous angiogenesis response induced in mice by leukocytes isolated from healthy humans and patients with oral infections. The most beneficial effects of the extract were obtained after its oral administration at the doses of 2 and 4 L. The administration of an 8 L dose produced the placebo-level effect [ [62](#B62-applsci-13-06477)]. [63](#B63-applsci-13-06477)]. L. Pharmacological Properties [64](#B64-applsci-13-06477)]. This was probably due to the high molecular weight of the polysaccharides that triggered the immunomodulatory response characterized by a net Th1 immune response in PBMC. It has been proven that the induction of the Th1 transcriptional profile is triggered Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the polysaccharides increased the nitric oxide (NO) and TNF- production in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells (in vitro) and rat alveolar macrophages (ex vivo) [ [65](#B65-applsci-13-06477)]. It has been shown that the NO and TNF- plasma levels were significantly elevated in adult Sprague Dawley rats, orally administered with used in pediatrics as antipyretics and diaphoretics, recommended for colds and flu [ [74](#B74-applsci-13-06477), [81](#B81-applsci-13-06477)]. 3.11.2. Safety of Use [81](#B81-applsci-13-06477)]. [82](#B82-applsci-13-06477), [83](#B83-applsci-13-06477)]. It is recommended to use the preparations in the form of divided doses in a maximum hot (drinkable) infusion [ [82](#B82-applsci-13-06477)]. 4.
