Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) is a 28 modern acupuncture therapy based on basic medicine commonly used in patients with pain. 29 However, evidence of its effectiveness in treating cancer pain has not been systematically 30 proven. Objective:The purpose of this practical randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the 31 effectiveness and safety of FSN for cancer pain treatment. 32 Methods and Analysis: In total, 78 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly divided into 33 two groups through block randomization. Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs 34 according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The treatment group will 35 receive FSN therapy once a day for 6 days. We will assess analgesic consumption as the primary 36 outcome and the numerical rating scale, outbreak pain, symptom assessment, and adverse 37 events as secondary outcomes to evaluate the effect and safety of FSN in the treatment of 38 cancer pain. The incidence of adverse events will be monitored to assess the safety of FSN. 39 Strengths and limitations of this study: The results of this study will indicate whether FSN 40 plays a positive role in cancer pain treatment,and may provide strong evidence to validate FSN in 41 patients with cancer pain, thereby promoting its development. However, real-world studies will 42 require a higher quality of data,which require us to strengthen data quality monitoring to 43 compensate for the quality. 44 Study Registration: The ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou 45 University of Chinese Medicine approved this study (approval No: K[2021]096), with registration 46 at Chictr.org.cn (identifier: ChiCTR2200056348) on February 4, 2022. acupuncture, Fu's subcutaneous needling, real-world studyPage 2 of 27 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Cancer pain is a comprehensive 52 symptom, with an overall prevalence of more than 70% in patients [3]. It causes symptoms such 53 as aches, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia [4]. 54 The World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder management is recognized as a 55 framework for the treatment of cancer pain [5], which provides patients with either opioids or non- 56 opioids depending on the intensity of the pain. Nevertheless, opioid-related adverse effects 57 perplex doctors and patients [6]. Moreover, these treatment regimens are insufficient to treat 58 symptoms related to cancer pain. Integrative oncology has been proposed to solve these 59 problems [7]. 60 As an important part of integrative oncology, acupuncture has attracted considerable 61 attention for the treatment of cancer pain. Evidence medicine presents promising effects of 62 acupuncture in reducing cancer pain intensity and decreasing the dosage of analgesics [8, 9]. A 63 meta-analysis has reported reductions in various types of cancer pain, including specific local 64 pain and systemic pain syndromes[10]. However, more rigorous research, including real-world 65 studies, is needed to evaluate these effects and determine ways to integrate acupuncture into 66 clinical practice [11]. 67 Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) therapy serves as a bridge between traditional 68 Chinese acupuncture and modern medical research. FSN operating techniques are inherited from 69 traditional Chinese medicine, but their ideological connotation and theoretical basis are derived 70 from anatomy and physiology. It uses a disposable special needle to sweep the superficial 71 subcutaneous fascia around the localized pain, in combination with reperfusion activities to 72 improve the state of local circulatory ischemia. FSN has a definite therapeutic effect on pain 73 treatment and has been widely used, involving muscle and soft tissue pain, visceral pain, and 74 other kinds of pain [12]. Therapy also plays a unique role in the treatment of cancer pain. A 75 clinical study [13] indicated that after 14 days of treatment, the dosage of Mscontin was 50.67 \u00b1 Page 3 of 27 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

In addition, the 79 quality of life score was improved in the treatment group, including comparison of scores for 80 appetite, pain, mental status, sleep, daily living, and social interaction. Another trial found that 81 adjuvant FSN therapy administered in patients with advanced cancer for the treatment of 82 moderate pain could decrease the dosage of analgesics and the frequency of cancer pain 83 outbreaks, thereby improving the quality of life of patients [14]. 84 However, evidence-based clinical research on cancer pain with FSN therapy is currently 85 limited, with certain flaws in research design and a high risk of bias [15]. All of the above 86 problems are not conducive to FSN's clinical application and promotion of FSN in treating cancer 87 pain. 88 Therefore, we will perform a pragmatic trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FSN 89 therapy in comprehensive cancer pain management. 90Material and methods 91Study Design 92 This study lasting from March 2022 to December 2024 will be conducted at the First Affiliated 93 Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. It will provide reference and high-quality 94 clinical research evidence for the clinical practice of FSN for the treatment of cancer pain. 95 This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Standard 96 Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines. The recruiters will 97 be responsible for screening for eligibility in the inpatient department, and they will assist patients 98 to fill the voluntary informed consent forms. After screening for eligibility, 78 patients will be 99 assigned randomly via block randomization to the treatment and control groups. Both groups will 100 receive basic analgesics according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 101 guidelines. The treatment group will receive FSN therapy once daily for 6 days.

The medicine will be 132 administered every 12 h. Physicians in the cancer department will calculate the dosage of 133 oxycontin based on the patient's pain severity and previous analgesic medication history. 134 In the case of acute outbreak pain, physicians will evaluate the nature of the pain and use 135 related treatments. For pain unrelated to oncologic emergencies, short-acting opioids with a rapid 136 effect (dose: 10%-20% of the daily dose of opioids) will be selected. Preanalgesic treatment 137 (such as dressing or expected activities) should be administered to predict outbreak pain. For 138 outbreak pain caused by bone metastasis, adjuvant drugs, such as non-steroidal anti- 139 inflammatory drugs, should be considered. If pain is caused by oncologic emergencies [16], the 140 physician will take corresponding medical measures and analgesic management after diagnosis 141 and evaluation. For example, it is recommended that new-onset back pain should be evaluated 142 as spinal cord compression until plain radiography or magnetic resonance imaging rules it out 143 [17, 18]. Otherwise, patients should receive other medical measures, such as steroid treatment, 144 surgery, and radiation therapy, to preserve their motor and sensory functions. 145 Acupuncture treatment 146 FSN therapy will be provided by certified acupuncturists with more than three years of 147 acupuncture experience. Acupuncturists will be retrained to ensure the completion of the study. 148 The patient will be asked to point to the most painful position, and the doctor will judge 149 the muscle tension and other abnormal sensations (stiffness and spasm) by palpation. 150 Furthermore, the doctor will check the range of motion of the muscle-related joint and strength of Page 6 of 27 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Then the FSN will be inserted into the subcutaneous tissue at a position of 152 approximately 5 cm around the location of pain, followed by sweeping and dispersing in all 153 directions. In general, the selected acupuncture point will be punctured with FSN once each time, 154 and the needle will be fan-swept in the range of 30\u00b0-45\u00b0 at a frequency of 100 times per min, 155 lasting for 2 min. Based on the theory of reperfusion, the patients will be guided to perform 156 isometric or isotonic muscle contractions for 10 s each time and repeat the reperfusion activities 157 three times. Finally, the doctor will withdraw the needle and leave the tube under the 158 subcutaneous tissue, using a sterile transparent dressing to fix the tube for 3-4 h. To restore the 159 clinical operation, FSN therapy will be administered once a day for 6 days. 160 Apart from FSN, other therapies that may stimulate acupoints, such as transcutaneous 161 electrical nerve stimulation, moxibustion, and acupressure, will not be allowed during this trial. 162 163 Sample Size Calculation 164 Based on a previous study of FSN in the adjuvant treatment of moderate cancer pain in patients 165 with advanced cancer [19], we will calculate the sample size using power analysis and sample 166 size 11.0 (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA). The superiority test of one-sided two samples with 167 a significance level of 0.025 and test efficacy of 80% will be used to compare the difference 168 between the treatment and control groups [20], and the boundary value will be defined as 1. In 169 this study, the numbers of patients in the two groups will be balanced. Considering that the 170 participants will be hospitalized patients with high compliance, we took a 5% dropout rate into 171 account and calculated the required sample size to be 78. 172 173 Randomization and Allocation Concealment 174 The researchers will screen patients for eligibility, and recruiters will be responsible for recruiting 175 78 individuals.

To minimize the bias 184 of subjective outcome reports, the researchers in charge of data collection from participants and 185 statistical analysis will be blinded to the allocation assignment. 186 187Outcomes Measurements 188 The evaluators will detect the outcomes at baseline, the 7th day, and during the follow-up period 189 (Table 1) 190 Primary outcome 191 Analgesics Consumption 192 We will use analgesics consumption as the primary outcome. The use of opioids will be evaluated 193 using morphine equivalents. For patients treated with opioids, 10 mg of opioids is equivalent to 20 194 mg of morphine. The dosage of analgesics at the end of the course of treatment and the total 195 amount of analgesics used during the course of treatment will be compared between these 196 groups. 197 Secondary outcomes 198 Pain degree 199 The NRS is a tool used to evaluate the degree of pain.

Therefore, complementary and 252 alternative therapies have become increasingly popular for symptom control in clinical practice 253 [23, 24], which has accelerated the development of integrative medicine [25]. In contrast to 254 conventional oncology care, integrative oncology aims to add evidence-based complementary 255 and alternative therapies to the daily care of patients, which would solve their physical and mental 256 problems and improve their quality of life [26]. Integrative oncology is developing rapidly via 257 evidence-based medical studies, such as integrative care [27], yoga [28] and massage [29]. 258 Acupuncture is conducive to cancer pain management [30-32]. However, available 259 evidence does not support the use of acupuncture alone in the treatment of cancer pain [9]. 260 Nonetheless, acupuncture remains an indispensable part of cancer pain management. Cancer 261 pain is often accompanied by anxiety and mood disorders [33] and acupuncture is regarded as an 262 effective method to regulate the affective-cognitive aspects of the brain, thereby solving pain and 263 pain-related symptoms [34]. 264 FSN therapy is an innovative method of acupuncture initiated by Dr. Zhonghua Fu in 265 1996. It is based on traditional academic thought of acupuncture and combines the academic 266 achievements of modern medicine. This therapy creatively proposes the concepts of pathological 267 tight muscle and reperfusion activity and attaches importance to the myofascial trigger point 268 (MTrp) [35]. 269 Scholars suggest that the mechanism of FSN analgesia has something to do with 270 drawing, avoidance, and stopped effects [35]. Based on previous studies and the characteristics 271 of the therapy, this type of therapy attaches importance to connective tissue, liquid crystal state 272 theory, MTrp, and reperfusion activity [35, 36]. It has the following characteristics. Therapists 273 select the acupuncture point according to the location and scope of the pain, taking lesions into Page 11 of 27 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Then they use special disposable needling puncture subcutaneously with reperfusion 275 activity to improve the ischemic state around the lesion. Moreover, they indwell the length of the 276 hose to prolong the action time to strengthen the effect. After more than 20 years of clinical 277 practice, it has been found that this therapy works well in the treatment of pain and is widely used 278 in various pain diseases, such as shoulder pain [37, 38], low back pain [39, 40], and knee 279 osteoarthritis [41]. 280 However, most studies on acupuncture are explanatory clinical trials with impoverished 281 extrapolations. Although FSN has been widely used in clinical practice, there is a lack of rigorous 282 practical controlled trials to prove its effect, with its therapeutic mechanism remaining unclear 283 [42]. Therefore, we designed this trial to fill the gap in research in this field. 284 Some researchers agree that setting sham-controlled group in acupuncture trials is 285 appropriate to reduce performance bias and detection bias due to the lack of blinding [43]. 286 However, the design of sham acupuncture remains controversial; some researchers suggest that 287 sham acupuncture indeed has only placebo effect on patients, while others believe that it may 288 cause a certain degree of stimulation and may have a possible therapeutic effect on the 289 outcomes [44, 45]. In recent years, non-blinded pragmatic trials have been recommended as it 290 emphasizes the real-world effects and their results are propitious for application and promotion in 291 clinical practice [46]. 292 This study has the following advantages. First, our pragmatic trial design will be more 293 suitable for real-world clinical practice. In addition, we will design and carry out this trial rigorously 294 to evaluate the effect of FSN in relieving cancer pain. Moreover, according to the NCCN, we can 295 effectively protect the rights and interests of patients by adding FSN therapy on the basis of 296 analgesia management. In addition, we will focus not only on the pain of patients but also on the 297 impact of pain, including the use of analgesics and changes in pain-related symptoms, which will 298 be more conducive to clinical practice. 299 This study will have some limitations, which need to be acknowledged. First, this trial will 300 be carried out in China; therefore, the applicability of the results to other populations will need to 301 be carefully interpreted. Second, real-world studies will require a higher quality of data; otherwise, Page 12 of 27 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) is a modern acupuncture therapy based on basic 27 medicine commonly used in patients with pain. However, evidence of its effectiveness in treating cancer 28 pain has not been systematically proven. Therefore, this pragmatic randomised controlled trial aims to 29 evaluate the effectiveness and safety of FSN for cancer pain management. 30 Methods and analysis: Overall, 120 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned into two 31 groups using block randomisation. Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs according to the 32 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The treatment group will receive FSN therapy once a 33 day for 6 days. Additionally, we will assess analgesic consumption as the primary outcome and the 34 numerical rating scale, outbreak pain, symptom assessment, and adverse events as secondary outcomes to 35 evaluate the effect and safety of FSN in treating cancer pain. The incidence of adverse events will be 36 monitored to assess the safety of FSN. 37 Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated 38 Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (approval No: K[2021]096). The results will be 39 published in a peer-reviewed journal, and trial participants will be informed via email and/or phone calls. 40 Trial registration number Chictr.org.cn (identifier: ChiCTR2200056348) was obtained on 4 February 42 Keywords: cancer pain, acupuncture, Fu's subcutaneous needling, pragmatic study 43 44 Strengths and limitations of this study 45 1. The trial may complement the clinical indications for FSN therapy. 46 2. The trial may furnish a new management method for cancer pain and its related symptom 47 3. The results may have implications for addressing opioid abuse. 48 4. The extrapolation of conclusions may be affected. 49 5. This study requires higher data quality.Page 2 of 24 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

It was estimated that there would be more than 1.9 million new patients with cancer in 2022 in the 53 United States [1], and more than 40% of cancer survivors experience cancer pain [2]. These patients also 54 experience cancer pain-related symptoms, such as aches, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia [3], because cancer 55 pain is a comprehensive symptom. Opioids or non-opioid drugs are provided to the cancer patients by the 56 physicians mainly depending on the intensity of the pain [4]. Nevertheless, opioid-related adverse effects 57 impede the usage of opioids even when necessary [5]. 58 Moreover, these treatment regimens are insufficient to treat symptoms related to cancer pain. Therefore, 59 integrative oncology, which includes acupuncture and its related therapies, has been proposed to solve 60 these problems [6-8]. 61 Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) therapy, which is a modern acupuncture technique [9], is used in cancer 62 pain management. FSN therapy is an innovative method of acupuncture that was initiated by Dr. Zhonghua 63 Fu in 1996. In addition, it is based on traditional academic thoughts of acupuncture and combines modern 64 medical academic achievements. This therapy creatively proposes the concepts of pathological tight 65 muscles and reperfusion activity and gives importance to the myofascial trigger point [10]. It uses a special 66 disposable needle to sweep the superficial subcutaneous fascia around the localised pain, combined with 67 reperfusion activities to improve the state of local circulatory ischaemia. Recently, FSN therapy has 68 become popular in pain treatment [11-13], and it is used in cancer pain management. A case series report 69 indicated that FSN therapy is conducive to analgesic effects [14]. Furthermore, Liu et al. showed that FSN 70 therapy could improve the quality of life of patients with cancer experiencing pain [15]. Another trial found 71 that adjuvant FSN therapy administered to patients with advanced cancer to treat moderate pain can 72 decrease the dosage of analgesics [16]. 73 However, evidence-based clinical research on cancer pain with FSN therapy is currently limited [17], with 74 certain flaws in research design and a high risk of bias, such as inappropriate control, incorrect 75 randomisation allocation, or a lack of sample size calculation. The above problems are detrimental to FSN's 76 clinical application and promotion of FSN in treating cancer pain. Therefore, we aim to perform a Page 3 of 24 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

This study will promote the clinical practise of FSN in treating cancer 83 pain. 84 This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol will be reported 85 based on the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines. The recruiters 86 will be responsible for screening patients for eligibility and assisting them in filling out voluntary informed 87 consent forms in the inpatient department. After screening for eligibility, 120 patients will be randomly 88 assigned to the treatment and control groups using block randomisation. Both groups will receive basic 89 analgesics according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The treatment 90 group will receive FSN therapy once daily for 6 days. Patients will be assessed for analgesic consumption, 91 the numeric rating scale (NRS), outbreak pain, and the Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS) on 92 the 7th day; the follow-up will be performed on the 14th and 21st day after the first treatment.

Patients who meet the eligibility 115 requirement will be informed about the trial to make decisions about whether they would like to participate 116 in this trial. After informed consent, a statistician will randomly assign the patients via block randomisation 117 into the treatment or control groups, with 60 cases in each group. The control group will be treated with 118 only analgesic management, whereas the treatment group will be treated with FSN therapy based on 119 analgesic management. Since FSN may be more effective for local pain treatment, we will limit recruitment 120 to patients with immobilisation pain. 121 122 Sample size calculation 123 Based on our previous study, the opioid dose per day in the treatment group is 64 \u00b1 43.56 mg and 86.15 \u00b1 124 85.78 mg in controlled group.

According to the principle of block randomisation, random numbers will be generated using 131 the STATA 14.0, packaged and concealed in envelopes by a third-party statistician. 132 The participants and practitioners involved in this study will not be blinded. However, the researchers 133 responsible for data collection from participants and statistical analysis will be blinded to the allocation 134 assignment to minimise the bias of subjective outcome reports. 135 136 Intervention 137 Analgesic management 138 Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs according to the NCCN cancer pain guidelines. The 139 medicine will be administered every 12 h. Physicians in the cancer department will calculate the dosage of 140 OxyContin based on the patient's pain severity and previous analgesic medication history. 141 In cases of acute outbreak pain, physicians will evaluate the nature of the pain and use related treatments. 142 For pain unrelated to oncological emergencies, short-acting opioids with a rapid effect (dose: 10%-20% of 143 the daily dose of opioids) will be selected. In addition, preanalgesic treatment (such as dressing or expected 144 activities) will be administered to predict outbreak pain. For outbreak pain caused by bone metastasis, 145 adjuvant drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, will be considered. If pain is caused by 146 oncological emergencies [18], the physician will take corresponding medical measures and analgesic 147 management after diagnosis and evaluation. For example, it is recommended that new-onset back pain 148 should be evaluated as spinal cord compression until plain radiography or magnetic resonance imaging Page 6 of 24 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Otherwise, patients should receive other medical measures, including steroid treatment, 150 surgery, and radiation therapy, to preserve their motor and sensory functions. 151 Acupuncture treatment 152 Certified acupuncturists with more than 3 years of acupuncture experience will provide FSN therapy. In 153 addition, acupuncturists will be retrained to ensure the completion of the study. 154 The patient will be asked to point to the most painful position, and the doctor will judge the muscle tension 155 and other abnormal sensations (stiffness and spasm) by palpation. Furthermore, the doctor will assess the 156 muscle-related joint's range of motion and muscle contraction strength. Subsequently, the FSN will be 157 inserted into the subcutaneous tissue at a position of approximately 5 cm around the location of pain, 158 followed by sweeping and dispersing in all directions. Generally, the selected acupuncture point will be 159 punctured with FSN once each time, and the needle will be fan-swept in the range of 30\u00b0-45\u00b0 at a 160 frequency of 50 times per min, lasting for 2 min. Next, based on the theory of reperfusion, the patients will 161 be guided to perform isometric or isotonic muscle contractions for 10 s each time and repeat the reperfusion 162 activities three times (Figure 2). Finally, the doctor will withdraw the needle and leave the tube under the 163 subcutaneous tissue, using a sterile transparent dressing to fix the tube for 3-4 h. FSN therapy will be 164 administered once a day for 6 days to restore the clinical operation. 165 Apart from FSN, other therapies that may stimulate acupoints, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve 166 stimulation, moxibustion, and acupressure, will not be allowed during this trial. 167 168 Outcomes measurements 169 The evaluators will detect the outcomes at baseline, on the 7th day, and during the follow-up period (Table 170 1) 171 Table 1.

The use of opioids will be evaluated using 181 morphine equivalents. For patients treated with opioids, 10 mg of opioids is equivalent to 20 mg of 182 morphine. The dosage of analgesics at the end of the treatment and the total amount of analgesics used 183 during the treatment will be compared between these groups. 184 Secondary outcomes 185 Pain degree 186 The NRS is a tool used to evaluate the degree of pain. The scale uses numbers from 0 to 10 to represent the 187 degree of pain. A 1-3 score indicates mild pain in patients, which stands for pain that does not considerably 188 affect the quality of life. Notably, when a score of 4-6 is presented, patients experience moderate pain. A 189 score >7 indicates severe pain. 190 Outbreak pain 191 We will record the frequency and number of pain outbreaks. Subsequently, when the treatment is 192 completed, we will extract the patient's daily outbreak pain information from the electronic medical record 193 to calculate the frequency and number of the patients' pain during the outbreak. 194 Symptom assessment 195 Patients will be assessed for symptoms related to cancer pain using the ESAS. The ESAS includes the 196 common symptoms of patients with cancer, such as tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, and drowsiness. 197 It is easy to use, and a higher score indicates worse symptoms. 198 Adverse events 199 In the case of an adverse event, its cause will be analysed to determine whether it is related to FSN or 200 analgesics. The data will be included in the safety analysis if an adverse event is related to FSN or 201 analgesics.Page 9 of 24 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from For peer review only 12 Information Classification: General254 DISCUSSION 255 Approximately 2/3 of the patients experience cancer pain during their illness [20]. Although there are many 256 guidelines for treating cancer pain, more than 30% of patients have uncontrollable symptoms [21]. The 257 serious adverse effects and potential addiction risks of opioids target new challenges in pain management 258 [22, 23]. Therefore, complementary and alternative therapies have become increasingly popular for 259 symptom control in clinical practise [24], which have accelerated the development of integrative medicine 260 [25]. In contrast to conventional oncology care, integrative oncology aims to add evidence-based 261 complementary and alternative therapies to the daily care of patients, which would solve their physical and 262 mental problems and improve their quality of life [26]. 263 As a part of integrative oncology, FSN has been used in pain management to reduce the analgesic dosage of 264 patients with cancer [14] or to adjust their negativity [15]. However, the mechanism of FSN analgesia is 265 insufficient. Chou indicates that myofascial trigger spots are fundamental to FSN, which is a consensus of 266 FSN practitioners [27]. Chiu believes that FSN can relieve pain by improving the skeletal muscle 267 mitochondrial ultrastructure and function [28]; however, the signal pathway is not fully elucidated. It was 268 not until 2021 that Xu proposed the immune hypothesis of the mechanism of action of FSN [9]. When the 269 needle stimulates the subcutaneous tissue, tissue self-repair will awaken the immune system. While 270 participating in the repair of tissue, immune cells (leukocytes and plasma cells) also improve the 271 pathological factors of the original pain (interleukin and tumour necrosis factor, among others) to achieve 272 the effect of pain relief. Nevertheless, this immune hypothesis has not yet been tested. 273 SIO-ASCO integrative medicine on cancer pain management guidelines suggests acupuncture may be 274 offered to patients with cancer experiencing pain, particularly those with musculoskeletal pain. However, 275 the evidence quality is intermediate [29]. Similar to other acupuncture research, the level of evidence from 276 the FSN study is not high because FSN is also confronted with a blinding design ordeal. However, the 277 design of sham acupuncture remains controversial. Some researchers suggest that sham acupuncture indeed 278 has only a placebo effect on patients. In contrast, others believe that it may cause a certain degree of 279 stimulation and may have a possible therapeutic effect on the outcomes [30, 31]. Recently, non-blinded 280 pragmatic trials have been recommended as they emphasise real-world effects and their results are 281 propitious for application and promotion in clinical practise [32, 33]. Therefore, using real-world study Page 12 of 24 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from For peer review only 13 Information Classification: General282 methods may be one of the important directions for future FSN research. Acupuncture or integrative 283 oncology can be promoted by advancing the FSN in this direction. On one hand, innovative acupuncture 284 procedures (battle-filed acupuncture and FSN) do not require doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine 285 knowledge. Relying on their existing knowledge background, they can quickly complete the innovative 286 acupuncture procedure training and start serving cancer patients. On the other hand, developing the 287 innovative acupuncture procedure will also force self-improvement and the evolution of traditional 288 acupuncture and align itself more with current clinical practise. 289 The advantages of our study design include the following: first, our pragmatic trial design will be more 290 suitable for real-world clinical practise. Second, we will design and conduct this trial rigorously to evaluate 291 the effect of FSN in relieving cancer pain. Third, according to the NCCN, we can effectively protect the 292 rights and interests of patients by adding FSN therapy based on analgesia management. Fourth, we will 293 focus on the pain of patients and the impact of pain, including the use of analgesics and changes in pain- 294 related symptoms, which will be more conducive to clinical practise. 295 This study will have some limitations, which should be acknowledged. First, this trial will be conducted in 296 China; therefore, the applicability of the results to other populations need to be carefully interpreted. 297 Second, real-world studies will require a higher quality of data; otherwise, the strength of the evidence will 298 be questionable and would require us to strengthen data quality monitoring to compensate for the quality. 299 300 Acknowledgements 301 The authors thank all involved in the study, including practitioners, assessors and participants. 302 303 Contributors 304 YHH designs this study.

Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) is a modern acupuncture therapy based on basic medicine 27 commonly used in patients with pain. However, evidence of its effectiveness in treating cancer pain has not 28 been systematically proven. Therefore, this pragmatic randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the 29 effectiveness and safety of FSN for cancer pain management. 30 Methods and analysis: Overall, 120 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned into two 31 groups using block randomisation. Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs according to the 32 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The treatment group will receive FSN therapy once a 33 day for 6 days. Additionally, we will assess analgesic consumption as the primary outcome and the 34 numerical rating scale, outbreak pain, symptom assessment, and adverse events as secondary outcomes to 35 evaluate the effect and safety of FSN in treating cancer pain. The incidence of adverse events will be 36 monitored to assess the safety of FSN. 37 Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated 38 Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (approval No: K[2021]096). The results will be 39 published in a peer-reviewed journal, and trial participants will be informed via email and/or phone calls. 40 Trial registration number Chictr.org.cn (identifier: ChiCTR2200056348) was obtained on 4 February 42 Keywords: cancer pain, acupuncture, Fu's subcutaneous needling, pragmatic study 43 44 Strengths and limitations of this study 45 1. This real-world study may complement the clinical indications for FSN therapy. 46 2. This study suggests a new management method for cancer pain and may have implications for 47 addressing opioid abuse. 48 3. The hospital included in this study is not internationally representative; therefore, the findings may not 49 represent practice in other hospitals or countries. 50 4. Our conclusions may be limited due to a single centre design without blinding. 51 5. Other 'real-world' factors may influence the data and its interpretation in this pragmatic study.Page 2 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

It was estimated that there would be more than 1.9 million new patients with cancer in 2022 in the 55 United States [1], and more than 40% of cancer survivors experience cancer pain [2]. These patients also 56 experience cancer pain-related symptoms, such as aches, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia [3], because cancer 57 pain is a comprehensive symptom. Opioids or non-opioid drugs are provided by the physician to patients 58 with cancer primarily depending on the intensity of the pain [4]. However, opioid-related adverse effects 59 can affect the usage of opioids for cancer pain [5]. 60 Medication treatment regimens can be insufficient to treat symptoms related to cancer pain. Therefore, 61 integrative oncology, which includes acupuncture and its related therapies, has been proposed to address 62 these problems [6-8]. 63 Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) therapy, which is a modern acupuncture technique [9], is used in cancer 64 pain management. FSN therapy is an innovative method of acupuncture that was initiated by Dr. Zhonghua 65 Fu in 1996. It is based on traditional academic acupuncture practice combined with modern medical 66 treatment. This therapy is based in concepts of pathologically tight muscles and beneficial reperfusion 67 activity and emphasises the myofascial trigger point [10]. It uses a special disposable needle to sweep the 68 superficial subcutaneous fascia around the localised pain, combined with reperfusion activities to improve 69 local circulation and eliminate ischaemia. Recently, FSN therapy has become popular in China for pain 70 treatment [11-13], and cancer pain management. A case series report indicated that FSN therapy produces 71 analgesic effects [14]. Furthermore, Liu et al. showed that FSN therapy could improve the quality of life of 72 patients with cancer experiencing pain [15]. Another trial found that adjuvant FSN therapy administered to 73 treat moderate pain in patients with advanced cancer can decrease the required dosage of analgesics [16]. 74 However, evidence-based clinical research on cancer pain with FSN therapy is currently limited [17], with 75 certain flaws in research design and a high risk of bias, such as inappropriate control, incorrect 76 randomisation allocation, or improper sample size calculation. The above problems must be addressed to 77 promote FSN's clinical application in treating cancer pain. Therefore, we aim to perform a pragmatic trial 78 with a rigorous design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FSN therapy in comprehensive cancer pain 79 management.

This study will promote the clinical practice of FSN in treating 84 cancer pain. 85 This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol will be reported 86 based on the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines. The recruiters 87 will be responsible for screening patients for eligibility and assisting them in filling out voluntary informed 88 consent forms in the inpatient department. After screening for eligibility, 120 patients will be randomly 89 assigned to the treatment or control groups using block randomisation. Both groups will receive basic 90 analgesics according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The treatment 91 group will also receive FSN therapy once daily for 6 days. Patients will be assessed for analgesic 92 consumption, the numeric rating scale (NRS), outbreak pain, and the Edmonton symptom assessment 93 system (ESAS) on the 7th day; the follow-up will be performed on the 14th and 21st day after the first 94 treatment. A trial flowchart is shown in Figure 1. 95 96 Participants 97 Eligibility criteria 98 Inclusion criteria 99 The inclusion criteria are as follows: 100 (1) Individuals aged 18 years 101 (2) Diagnosis of cancer by pathological examination 102 (3) Moderate to severe pain (NRS 4) at an immobilised location 103 (4) Signed informed consentPage 4 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Patients who meet the eligibility 116 requirement will be informed about the trial before deciding whether they would like to participate.. After 117 informed consent, a statistician will randomly assign the patients via block randomisation into the treatment 118 or control groups, with 60 participants in each group. The control group will have their pain treated with 119 analgesic management alone, whereas the treatment group will have pain treated with FSN therapy in 120 addition to analgesic management. Since FSN may be more effective for local pain treatment, we will limit 121 recruitment to patients with immobilisation pain. 122 123 Sample size calculation 124 Based on our previous study[18], the opioid dose(morphine equivalent doses) per day in the treatment 125 group is 64 \u00b1 43.56 mg and 86.15 \u00b1 85.78 mg in control group. Therefore, we set =0.05 and =0.2; 126 subsequently, we calculated the sample size as 60 per group using power analysis and sample size 11.0 127 (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA). 128Page 5 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

According to the principle of block randomisation, random numbers, generated using the 132 STATA 14.0, will be packaged and concealed in envelopes by a third-party statistician. 133 The participants and practitioners involved in this study will not be blinded. However, the researchers 134 responsible for data collection from participants and statistical analysis will be blinded to the allocation 135 assignment to minimise the bias of subjective outcome reports. 136 137 Intervention 138 Analgesic management 139 Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs according to the NCCN cancer pain guidelines. The 140 medication will be administered every 12 h. Physicians in the cancer department will calculate the dosage 141 of OxyContin based on the patient's pain severity and previous analgesic medication history. 142 In cases of acute outbreak pain, physicians will evaluate the nature of the pain and use related treatments. 143 For pain unrelated to oncological emergencies, short-acting opioids with a rapid effect (dose: 10%-20% of 144 the daily dose of opioids) will be selected. In addition, analgesia will be administered to prevent predictable 145 outbreak pain, such as that elicited by dressing changes or activity. For outbreak pain caused by bone 146 metastasis, adjuvant medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be considered. If pain 147 is caused by oncological emergencies [19], the physician will take corresponding medical measures and 148 intitute analgesic management after diagnosis and evaluation. For example, it is recommended that new- 149 onset back pain should be evaluated as spinal cord compression until plain radiography or magnetic 150 resonance imaging rules it out [20]. Otherwise, patients should receive other medical measures, including 151 steroid treatment, surgery, and radiation therapy, to preserve their motor and sensory functions.Page 6 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

In 154 addition, acupuncturists will be retrained to ensure the completion of the study. 155 The patient will be asked to indicate the most painful point, and the doctor will assess the level of muscle 156 tension and other abnormal sensations (stiffness and spasm) by palpation. Furthermore, the doctor will 157 assess the muscle-related joint's range of motion and muscle contraction strength. Subsequently, the FSN 158 will be inserted into the subcutaneous tissue at a position of approximately 5 cm around the location of 159 pain, followed by sweeping and dispersing in all directions. Generally, the selected acupuncture point will 160 be punctured with FSN once each time, and the needle will be fan-swept in the range of 30\u00b0-45\u00b0 at a 161 frequency of 50 times per min, lasting for 2 min. Next, based on the theory of reperfusion, the patients will 162 be guided to perform isometric or isotonic muscle contractions for 10 s each time and repeat the reperfusion 163 activities three times (Figure 2). Finally, the doctor will withdraw the needle and leave the tube under the 164 subcutaneous tissue, using a sterile transparent dressing to fix the tube for 3-4 h. FSN therapy will be 165 administered once a day for 6 days. 166 Apart from FSN, any other therapies that may stimulate acupoints, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve 167 stimulation, moxibustion, and acupressure, will not be allowed during this trial. 168 169 Outcomes measurements 170 The evaluators will detect the outcomes at baseline, on the 7th day, and during the follow-up period (Table 171 1) 172 Table 1.

The dosage of analgesics at the end of the treatment and the total amount of analgesics used 184 during the treatment will be compared between these groups. 185 Secondary outcomes 186 Pain degree 187 The NRS is a tool used to evaluate the degree of pain. The scale uses numbers from 0 to 10 to represent the 188 degree of pain. A 1-3 score indicates mild pain in patients, indicating pain that does not considerably affect 189 the quality of life. A score of 4-6 indicates moderate pain. A score >7 indicates severe pain. 190 Outbreak pain 191 We will record the frequency and number of pain outbreaks. Subsequently, when the treatment is 192 completed, we will extract the patient's daily outbreak pain information from the electronic medical record 193 to calculate the frequency and degree of the patients' pain during the outbreak. 194 Symptom assessment 195 Patients will be assessed for symptoms related to cancer pain using the ESAS. The ESAS includes the 196 common symptoms of patients with cancer, such as tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, and drowsiness. 197 It is easy to use, and a higher score indicates worse symptoms. 198 Adverse events 199 In the case of an adverse event, its cause will be analysed to determine whether it is related to FSN or 200 analgesics. The data will be included in the safety analysis. 201 Adverse reactions of FSN may include fainting, sticking of the needle, bending of the needle, instrument 202 breakage and haematoma. The side effects of analgesics include constipation, nausea, vomiting, urinary 203 retention, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, opioid overdoses, and poisoning. 204 Serious incidents will be immediately reported to the ethics committee, and the trial will be stopped to 205 protect patients' rights. 206Page 9 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Although 254 there are many guidelines for treating cancer pain, more than 30% of patients have uncontrollable 255 symptoms[22]. The serious adverse effects and potential addiction risks of opioids provide challenges in 256 pain management[23, 24]. Therefore, complementary and alternative therapies have become increasingly Page 11 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from For peer review only 12 Information Classification: General257 popular for symptom control in clinical practice[25], leading to an acceleration in the development of 258 integrative medicine[26]. In contrast to conventional oncology care, integrative oncology aims to add 259 evidence-based complementary and alternative therapies to the daily care of patientsto address their 260 physical and mental problems and improve their quality of life[27]. 261 As a part of integrative oncology, FSN has been used in pain management to reduce the analgesic dosage 262 needed by patients with cancer [14] and to improve quality of life [15]. However, the mechanism of FSN 263 analgesia is not well understood. Chou indicates that myofascial trigger spots are fundamental to FSN, 264 which is a consensus of FSN practitioners[28]. Li believes that FSN can relieve pain by improving the 265 skeletal muscle mitochondrial ultrastructure and function[29]; however, the signal pathway is not fully 266 understood. It was not until 2021 that Xu proposed the immune hypothesis for the mechanism of action of 267 FSN [9]. When the needle stimulates the subcutaneous tissue, tissue self-repair will stimulate the immune 268 system. While participating in the repair of tissue, immune cells (leukocytes and plasma cells) also block 269 the pathological factors of the original pain (interleukin and tumour necrosis factor, among others) to 270 achieve the effect of pain relief. However, this immune hypothesis has not yet been tested. 271 The Society for Integrative Oncology- American Society of Clinical OncologySIO-ASCOmanagement 272 guidelines on integrative medicine cancer pain suggests acupuncture may be offered to patients with cancer 273 experiencing pain, particularly those with musculoskeletal pain. However, the evidence quality is 274 intermediate[30]. Similar to other acupuncture research, the level of evidence from the FSN study is not 275 high because FSN study is also confronted with a blinding design challenge. However, the design of sham 276 acupuncture studies remains controversial. Some researchers suggest that sham acupuncture has only a 277 placebo effect on patients. In contrast, others believe that it may cause a certain degree of stimulation and 278 may have a possible therapeutic effect on the outcomes[31, 32]. Recently, non-blinded pragmatic trials 279 have been recommended as they emphasise real-world effects and their results are propitious for 280 application and promotion in clinical practice[18, 33]. Therefore, using real-world study methods may be 281 one of the important directions for future FSN research. Acupuncture or integrative oncology can be 282 promoted by advancing the FSN in this way. On one hand, innovative acupuncture procedures (battle-filed 283 acupuncture and FSN) do not require doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine. Relying on their 284 existing knowledge background, they can quickly complete the innovative acupuncture procedure training Page 12 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

On the other hand, developing the innovative acupuncture procedure 286 will also force self-improvement and the evolution of traditional acupuncture and align itself more with 287 current clinical practice. 288 The advantages of our study design include the following: first, our pragmatic trial design will be more 289 suitable for real-world clinical practice. Second, we will design and conduct this trial rigorously to evaluate 290 the effect of FSN in relieving cancer pain. Third, according to the NCCN, we can effectively protect the 291 rights and interests of patients by adding FSN therapy to their analgesia management. Fourth, we will focus 292 on the pain of patients and the impact of pain, including the use of analgesics and changes in pain-related 293 symptoms, which will be valuable to clinical practice. 294 This study has some limitations. First, this trial will be conducted in China; therefore, the applicability of 295 the results to other populations needs to be considered carefully. Second, patients may be unintentionally 296 biased when reporting to outcome assessors due to the open-label design. This should be taken into account 297 when interpreting the results of the study. Third, this is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial; therefore, 298 other 'real-world' factors may influence the data and its interpretation. We will interpret our results 299 carefully with these limitations in mind. 300 301 Acknowledgements 302 The authors thank all involved in the study, including practitioners, assessors and participants. 303 304 Contributors 305 YHH designed this study.

For cancer patients, pain is a distressing clinical symptom with an overall prevalence rate more than 70%. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN \u00ae) Guidelines for adult cancer pain indicate that acupuncture and related therapies may be valuable additions to pharmacologic interventions for pain management. A pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of FSN for cancer pain management.

Downloaded from For peer review only The study design will incorporate individualised treatment flexibility in a real- world setting, which will be more appropriate to FSN research and provide realistic estimates of FSN effects. Unlike most traditional randomised controlled trials which test a hypothesis under ideal conditions or determine causes and effects of treatment, pragmatic randomised controlled trials compare treatments under everyday clinical conditions, with the aim of improving practice by inform ing clinical and policy decisions directly. They are characterised by more representative sample s because there is less restriction on eligibility criteria, real-world treatments using flexible protocols and local customization , and brief outcome assess ments so data can be easily collected in clinical settings.

Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) is a modern acupuncture therapy based on basic medicine 27 commonly used in patients with pain. However, evidence of its effectiveness in treating cancer pain has not 28 been systematically proven. Therefore, this pragmatic randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the 29 effectiveness and safety of FSN for cancer pain management. 30 Methods and analysis: Overall, 120 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned into two 31 groups using block randomisation. Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs according to the 32 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The treatment group will receive FSN therapy once a 33 day for 6 days. Additionally, we will assess analgesic consumption as the primary outcome and the 34 numerical rating scale, outbreak pain, symptom assessment, and adverse events as secondary outcomes to 35 evaluate the effect and safety of FSN in treating cancer pain. The incidence of adverse events will be 36 monitored to assess the safety of FSN. 37 Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated 38 Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (approval No: K[2021]096). The results will be 39 published in a peer-reviewed journal, and trial participants will be informed via email and/or phone calls. 40 Trial registration number Chictr.org.cn (identifier: ChiCTR2200056348) was obtained on 4 February 42 Keywords: cancer pain, acupuncture, Fu's subcutaneous needling, pragmatic study 43 44 Strengths and limitations of this study 45 1. This real-world study may complement the clinical indications for FSN therapy. 46 2. This study suggests a new management method for cancer pain and may have implications for 47 addressing opioid abuse. 48 3. The hospital included in this study is not internationally representative; therefore, the findings may not 49 represent practice in other hospitals or countries. 50 4. Our conclusions may be limited due to a single centre design without blinding. 51 5. Other 'real-world' factors may influence the data and its interpretation in this pragmatic study.Page 2 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

It was estimated that there would be more than 1.9 million new patients with cancer in 2022 in the 55 United States [1], and more than 40% of cancer survivors experience cancer pain [2]. These patients also 56 experience cancer pain-related symptoms, such as aches, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia [3], because cancer 57 pain is a comprehensive symptom. Opioids or non-opioid drugs are provided by the physician to patients 58 with cancer primarily depending on the intensity of the pain [4]. However, opioid-related adverse effects 59 can affect the usage of opioids for cancer pain [5]. 60 Medication treatment regimens can be insufficient to treat symptoms related to cancer pain. Therefore, 61 integrative oncology, which includes acupuncture and its related therapies, has been proposed to address 62 these problems [6-8]. 63 Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) therapy, which is a modern acupuncture technique [9], is used in cancer 64 pain management. FSN therapy is an innovative method of acupuncture that was initiated by Dr. Zhonghua 65 Fu in 1996. It is based on traditional academic acupuncture practice combined with modern medical 66 treatment. This therapy is based in concepts of pathologically tight muscles and beneficial reperfusion 67 activity and emphasises the myofascial trigger point [10]. It uses a special disposable needle to sweep the 68 superficial subcutaneous fascia around the localised pain, combined with reperfusion activities to improve 69 local circulation and eliminate ischaemia. Recently, FSN therapy has become popular in China for pain 70 treatment [11-13], and cancer pain management. A case series report indicated that FSN therapy produces 71 analgesic effects [14]. Furthermore, Liu et al. showed that FSN therapy could improve the quality of life of 72 patients with cancer experiencing pain [15]. Another trial found that adjuvant FSN therapy administered to 73 treat moderate pain in patients with advanced cancer can decrease the required dosage of analgesics [16]. 74 However, evidence-based clinical research on cancer pain with FSN therapy is currently limited [17], with 75 certain flaws in research design and a high risk of bias, such as inappropriate control, incorrect 76 randomisation allocation, or improper sample size calculation. The above problems must be addressed to 77 promote FSN's clinical application in treating cancer pain. Therefore, we aim to perform a pragmatic trial 78 with a rigorous design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FSN therapy in comprehensive cancer pain 79 management.

This study will promote the clinical practice of FSN in treating 84 cancer pain. 85 This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol will be reported 86 based on the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines. The recruiters 87 will be responsible for screening patients for eligibility and assisting them in filling out voluntary informed 88 consent forms in the inpatient department. After screening for eligibility, 120 patients will be randomly 89 assigned to the treatment or control groups using block randomisation. Both groups will receive basic 90 analgesics according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The treatment 91 group will also receive FSN therapy once daily for 6 days. Patients will be assessed for analgesic 92 consumption, the numeric rating scale (NRS), outbreak pain, and the Edmonton symptom assessment 93 system (ESAS) on the 7th day; the follow-up will be performed on the 14th and 21st day after the first 94 treatment. A trial flowchart is shown in Figure 1. 95 96 Participants 97 Eligibility criteria 98 Inclusion criteria 99 The inclusion criteria are as follows: 100 (1) Individuals aged 18 years 101 (2) Diagnosis of cancer by pathological examination 102 (3) Moderate to severe pain (NRS 4) at an immobilised location 103 (4) Signed informed consentPage 4 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Patients who meet the eligibility 116 requirement will be informed about the trial before deciding whether they would like to participate.. After 117 informed consent, a statistician will randomly assign the patients via block randomisation into the treatment 118 or control groups, with 60 participants in each group. The control group will have their pain treated with 119 analgesic management alone, whereas the treatment group will have pain treated with FSN therapy in 120 addition to analgesic management. Since FSN may be more effective for local pain treatment, we will limit 121 recruitment to patients with immobilisation pain. 122 123 Sample size calculation 124 Based on our previous study[18], the opioid dose(morphine equivalent doses) per day in the treatment 125 group is 64 \u00b1 43.56 mg and 86.15 \u00b1 85.78 mg in control group. Therefore, we set =0.05 and =0.2; 126 subsequently, we calculated the sample size as 60 per group using power analysis and sample size 11.0 127 (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA). 128Page 5 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

According to the principle of block randomisation, random numbers, generated using the 132 STATA 14.0, will be packaged and concealed in envelopes by a third-party statistician. 133 The participants and practitioners involved in this study will not be blinded. However, the researchers 134 responsible for data collection from participants and statistical analysis will be blinded to the allocation 135 assignment to minimise the bias of subjective outcome reports. 136 137 Intervention 138 Analgesic management 139 Both groups will be administered analgesic drugs according to the NCCN cancer pain guidelines. The 140 medication will be administered every 12 h. Physicians in the cancer department will calculate the dosage 141 of OxyContin based on the patient's pain severity and previous analgesic medication history. 142 In cases of acute outbreak pain, physicians will evaluate the nature of the pain and use related treatments. 143 For pain unrelated to oncological emergencies, short-acting opioids with a rapid effect (dose: 10%-20% of 144 the daily dose of opioids) will be selected. In addition, analgesia will be administered to prevent predictable 145 outbreak pain, such as that elicited by dressing changes or activity. For outbreak pain caused by bone 146 metastasis, adjuvant medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be considered. If pain 147 is caused by oncological emergencies [19], the physician will take corresponding medical measures and 148 intitute analgesic management after diagnosis and evaluation. For example, it is recommended that new- 149 onset back pain should be evaluated as spinal cord compression until plain radiography or magnetic 150 resonance imaging rules it out [20]. Otherwise, patients should receive other medical measures, including 151 steroid treatment, surgery, and radiation therapy, to preserve their motor and sensory functions.Page 6 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

In 154 addition, acupuncturists will be retrained to ensure the completion of the study. 155 The patient will be asked to indicate the most painful point, and the doctor will assess the level of muscle 156 tension and other abnormal sensations (stiffness and spasm) by palpation. Furthermore, the doctor will 157 assess the muscle-related joint's range of motion and muscle contraction strength. Subsequently, the FSN 158 will be inserted into the subcutaneous tissue at a position of approximately 5 cm around the location of 159 pain, followed by sweeping and dispersing in all directions. Generally, the selected acupuncture point will 160 be punctured with FSN once each time, and the needle will be fan-swept in the range of 30\u00b0-45\u00b0 at a 161 frequency of 50 times per min, lasting for 2 min. Next, based on the theory of reperfusion, the patients will 162 be guided to perform isometric or isotonic muscle contractions for 10 s each time and repeat the reperfusion 163 activities three times (Figure 2). Finally, the doctor will withdraw the needle and leave the tube under the 164 subcutaneous tissue, using a sterile transparent dressing to fix the tube for 3-4 h. FSN therapy will be 165 administered once a day for 6 days. 166 Apart from FSN, any other therapies that may stimulate acupoints, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve 167 stimulation, moxibustion, and acupressure, will not be allowed during this trial. 168 169 Outcomes measurements 170 The evaluators will detect the outcomes at baseline, on the 7th day, and during the follow-up period (Table 171 1) 172 Table 1.

The dosage of analgesics at the end of the treatment and the total amount of analgesics used 184 during the treatment will be compared between these groups. 185 Secondary outcomes 186 Pain degree 187 The NRS is a tool used to evaluate the degree of pain. The scale uses numbers from 0 to 10 to represent the 188 degree of pain. A 1-3 score indicates mild pain in patients, indicating pain that does not considerably affect 189 the quality of life. A score of 4-6 indicates moderate pain. A score >7 indicates severe pain. 190 Outbreak pain 191 We will record the frequency and number of pain outbreaks. Subsequently, when the treatment is 192 completed, we will extract the patient's daily outbreak pain information from the electronic medical record 193 to calculate the frequency and degree of the patients' pain during the outbreak. 194 Symptom assessment 195 Patients will be assessed for symptoms related to cancer pain using the ESAS. The ESAS includes the 196 common symptoms of patients with cancer, such as tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, and drowsiness. 197 It is easy to use, and a higher score indicates worse symptoms. 198 Adverse events 199 In the case of an adverse event, its cause will be analysed to determine whether it is related to FSN or 200 analgesics. The data will be included in the safety analysis. 201 Adverse reactions of FSN may include fainting, sticking of the needle, bending of the needle, instrument 202 breakage and haematoma. The side effects of analgesics include constipation, nausea, vomiting, urinary 203 retention, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, opioid overdoses, and poisoning. 204 Serious incidents will be immediately reported to the ethics committee, and the trial will be stopped to 205 protect patients' rights. 206Page 9 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Although 258 there are many guidelines for treating cancer pain, more than 30% of patients have uncontrollable 259 symptoms[22]. The serious adverse effects and potential addiction risks of opioids provide challenges in 260 pain management[23, 24]. Therefore, complementary and alternative therapies have become increasingly 261 popular for symptom control in clinical practice[25], leading to an acceleration in the development of 262 integrative medicine[26]. In contrast to conventional oncology care, integrative oncology aims to add 263 evidence-based complementary and alternative therapies to the daily care of patientsto address their 264 physical and mental problems and improve their quality of life[27]. 265 As a part of integrative oncology, FSN has been used in pain management to reduce the analgesic dosage 266 needed by patients with cancer [14] and to improve quality of life [15]. However, the mechanism of FSN 267 analgesia is not well understood. Chou indicates that myofascial trigger spots are fundamental to FSN, 268 which is a consensus of FSN practitioners[28]. Li believes that FSN can relieve pain by improving the 269 skeletal muscle mitochondrial ultrastructure and function[29]; however, the signal pathway is not fully 270 understood. It was not until 2021 that Xu proposed the immune hypothesis for the mechanism of action of 271 FSN [9]. When the needle stimulates the subcutaneous tissue, tissue self-repair will stimulate the immune 272 system. While participating in the repair of tissue, immune cells (leukocytes and plasma cells) also block 273 the pathological factors of the original pain (interleukin and tumour necrosis factor, among others) to 274 achieve the effect of pain relief. However, this immune hypothesis has not yet been tested. 275 The Society for Integrative Oncology- American Society of Clinical OncologySIO-ASCOmanagement 276 guidelines on integrative medicine cancer pain suggests acupuncture may be offered to patients with cancer 277 experiencing pain, particularly those with musculoskeletal pain. However, the evidence quality is 278 intermediate[30]. Similar to other acupuncture research, the level of evidence from the FSN study is not 279 high because FSN study is also confronted with a blinding design challenge. However, the design of sham 280 acupuncture studies remains controversial. Some researchers suggest that sham acupuncture has only a 281 placebo effect on patients. In contrast, others believe that it may cause a certain degree of stimulation and 282 may have a possible therapeutic effect on the outcomes[31, 32]. Recently, non-blinded pragmatic trials Page 12 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from For peer review only 13 Information Classification: General283 have been recommended as they emphasise real-world effects and their results are propitious for 284 application and promotion in clinical practice[18, 33]. Therefore, using real-world study methods may be 285 one of the important directions for future FSN research. Acupuncture or integrative oncology can be 286 promoted by advancing the FSN in this way. On one hand, innovative acupuncture procedures (battle-filed 287 acupuncture and FSN) do not require doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine. Relying on their 288 existing knowledge background, they can quickly complete the innovative acupuncture procedure training 289 and start serving patients with cancer. On the other hand, developing the innovative acupuncture procedure 290 will also force self-improvement and the evolution of traditional acupuncture and align itself more with 291 current clinical practice. 292 The advantages of our study design include the following: first, our pragmatic trial design will be more 293 suitable for real-world clinical practice. Second, we will design and conduct this trial rigorously to evaluate 294 the effect of FSN in relieving cancer pain. Third, according to the NCCN, we can effectively protect the 295 rights and interests of patients by adding FSN therapy to their analgesia management. Fourth, we will focus 296 on the pain of patients and the impact of pain, including the use of analgesics and changes in pain-related 297 symptoms, which will be valuable to clinical practice. 298 This study has some limitations. First, this trial will be conducted in China; therefore, the applicability of 299 the results to other populations needs to be considered carefully. Second, patients may be unintentionally 300 biased when reporting to outcome assessors due to the open-label design. This should be taken into account 301 when interpreting the results of the study. Third, this is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial; therefore, 302 other 'real-world' factors may influence the data and its interpretation. We will interpret our results 303 carefully with these limitations in mind. 304 305 Acknowledgements 306 The authors thank all involved in the study, including practitioners, assessors and participants. 307Page 13 of 30 For peer review only - http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlBMJ Open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 on September 17, 2023 by guest.

For cancer patients, pain is a distressing clinical symptom with an overall prevalence rate more than 70%. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN \u00ae) Guidelines for adult cancer pain indicate that acupuncture and related therapies may be valuable additions to pharmacologic interventions for pain management. A pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of FSN for cancer pain management.

Downloaded from For peer review only The study design will incorporate individualised treatment flexibility in a real- world setting, which will be more appropriate to FSN research and provide realistic estimates of FSN effects. Unlike most traditional randomised controlled trials which test a hypothesis under ideal conditions or determine causes and effects of treatment, pragmatic randomised controlled trials compare treatments under everyday clinical conditions, with the aim of improving practice by inform ing clinical and policy decisions directly. They are characterised by more representative sample s because there is less restriction on eligibility criteria, real-world treatments using flexible protocols and local customization , and brief outcome assess ments so data can be easily collected in clinical settings. This research has been initiated by the researcher Dr. Yihan H e. This research has been funded by Guangdong Provincial Key L aboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture (06), National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 82004447), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (no. 2021A1515011597), and the Specific Research Fund for TCM Science and Technology (no. YN2018QL04) from the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine. This research is being conducted in the oncology department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine . 3 What does participation in this research involve? If you decide to take part in the research project, you will first be given a questionnaire asking about your pain degree ; this will determine if you are eligible to take part.
