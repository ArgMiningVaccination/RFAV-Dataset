COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions Additional doses, booster shots What's the difference between an additional doses and a booster shot? Additional dose: When someone with a weakened immune system gets an additional dose of vaccine, it is not a booster. It is part of the first series of shots needed for the person to be fully vaccinated. Many people with impaired immunity did not have a full response to their first doses. Booster shot: An additional dose is a booster when someone had a full response to vaccination, but effectiveness wanes over time. The booster re-energizes their immune response.

Get vaccinated: If you are 6 months and over, getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19. All approved vaccines have been proven safe and effective. Vaccines are highly effective against severe disease and hospitalization. Wear a mask or face covering: Masks continue to be recommended in crowded spaces and for those who are not vaccinated or who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. Wash your hands often: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If you don't have soap and water, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick: If you have symptoms of respiratory infection, stay home until you are feeling better. If you test positive for COVID-19, stay home for at least 5 days and follow CDC's isolation recommendations. When possible, avoid contact with people who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Cover coughs and sneezes: Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Throw the tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Move activities outside and consider distancing: The closer you are to a greater number of people, the more likely it is to be exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. If cases or hospitalizations are increasing in our community, you may want to avoid crowded areas, keep distance between yourself and others, and move indoor activities outdoors when possible.
