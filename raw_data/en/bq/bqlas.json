We never use synthetic fragrances or preservatives. You know they are genuinely natural as every Weleda beauty product bears the internationally recognised NATRUE seal of quality. The NATRUE seal guarantees the highest standards. This means products contain only natural and organically sourced ingredients, have not been tested on animals, do not contain silicone oils nor ingredients from petrochemicals and are made by a truly authentic brand. Always the highest quality As a pharmaceutical company we control our whole supply chain, sometimes even down to the field or tree the ingredient comes from, so you can be assured a Weleda product is of the highest quality available. Our teams of scientists carefully process the ingredients, using their expertise and insights into 'nature's wisdom', ensuring the purest plant essence is extracted as a whole and activated to realise its potential. Our healthcare experts create holistic formulations to work with you on a physical and an emotional level. Every ingredient provides a health benefit, not as a cheap filler or to make a fashionable marketing claim. For always We have been doing all of this since 1921, so it's certainly not a bandwagon we have jumped on recently. Weleda is still owned by the 'not-for-profit' organisations created by our founders Rudolf Steiner and Dr Ita Wegman, just one more way in which Weleda is unique in the world of natural health and well being. 2 3With so many brands claiming to be natural, organic and sustainable it is important to know exactly what you are buying. At Weleda, we have been growing and creating natural medicines and body care products for almost a hundred years - often to the same original, authentic recipes we know work and have stood the test of time. Weleda pioneered the way for others to follow - through our sustainable business practises, the way we farm and grow our plants, our fair-trade values, and our pharmaceutical standards which produce the highest quality natural cosmetics you can buy today*. We are the No 1 producer of certified natural skin and health care products globally, supplying across five continents and over fifty countries. All our cosmetics are natural and organic, with over 80% of our plant-based ingredients grown organically - all independently certified by NATRUE. We are one of a few cosmetic companies to be accepted for the Union for Ethical Bio Trade certification through which we have verified over 1000 of our supply chains as 'Sourced with Respect' for people, biodiversity and the environment.

Steiner viewed the human body as having the capacity to heal using gifts from nature and he called his approach anthroposophy - meaning 'a wisdom of man'. Weleda grew out of this work. It is this understanding of the connections between man and nature which makes Weleda's skincare products unique. When you use a Weleda product you can see, smell and feel this for yourself. Our potent all-natural ingredients give targeted support to the body's own processes. They enhance the body's ability to heal and to bring the skin into balance. Weleda products promote the vitality of the skin, rather than simply replacing what it lacks.Steiner named the company Weleda, inspired by the Celtic word Veleda or Veleta for a female healer or wise woman. He also designed the company logo himself, using the ancient Greek symbol for medicine and health - the rod and serpent - being embraced by the arms of humanity. Weleda is owned by the not-for-profit organisations of its founders and our profits fund their work into holistic medical research and education. We are proud to say many of our products produced today are the original formulations, created when our company was founded. That's true sustainability. 2020 Purifying Gel Cleanser Refining Lotion S.O.S Spot TreatmentSkin Food Light, Skin Food Lip Balm, Skin Food Body Butter 2019 1955 Sea Buckthorn ElixirNO ANIMAL TESTING100% CERTIFIED NATURAL CAREFREE FROM MINERAL OIL, PARABENS, SILICONES AND PEGS FREE FROM SYNTHETIC FRAGRANCES, GENETICALL Y MODIFIED INGREDIENTS AND MICROPLASTIC INGREDIENTS 80% BOT ANICALS CERTIFIED ORGANICETHICAL SOURCING WITH RESPECT FOR PEOPLE AND BIODIVERSITY 6 7With the advent of cleaner living there has never been a better time to switch to all-natural skincare, but how do we, as consumers, know what we are buying and which brand should we trust? Sadly, there is no legal definition for natural cosmetics and a product may be labelled as 'organic' when it contains as little as 5% certified ingredients. How do we know a product is authentic rather than a 'conventional' synthetic product re-badged with a green leaf and a few selected natural ingredients, supported by clever marketing to make the product look more natural than it really is? This is known as 'green-washing' and sadly, it really does happen. Today it is even more important for skincare brands to be honest and transparent about the business practises they operate - are they doing the right thing for people and the planet or simply chasing sales and profit? Look for a respected certification seal on the packaging as this means it has been independently tested and verified as natural/ organic, is not tested on animals or is made in a more sustainable way. We are also members of the Union for Ethical Bio Trade and our ingredients and business practices are certified under the 'Sourcing Being responsible to you and the planet Clean beauty you can trust Jayn Sterland, MD of Weleda UK, was recently awarded the top spot in the 'Who's Who of Natural Beauty' list of movers and shakers for the fourth year running. She is a member of the influential British Beauty Council. with Respect' label. For clarity, Weleda has also created a series of icons denoting our business practices which will begin to appear on our packaging and in our marketing. Weleda's commitment can be shown in the 12 clear statements below. Being an ethical company requires a huge amount of commitment, costs money and isn't easy, but it is essential, we are honest and transparent about the ingredients we are using. Beauty products, including the vast majority of everyday washes, deodorants and toothpastes - contain a cocktail of ingredients - often over twenty in every product, each being there to serve a purpose - but not all are for your benefit. Preservatives are added to extend shelf life, foaming agents are used to make the product easier to use, inert fillers are added to bulk out the more expensive actives, liquid plastics are added to make skin and hair feel silky soft, synthetic nano-particles are created in the lab to penetrate the deeper layers of the skin for increased effectiveness. Our commitment to you Guaranteed 100% certified natural care 80% of our botanicals are certified as organic Our plant oils, extracts, waxes and fragrances come from protected natural origin Our sourcing is both ethical and sustainable across our supply chains, with respect to nature, the environment and the human being. The fragrances used by our in-house perfumers are 100% natural We operate transparent, sustainable business practises, with targets aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)We believe in nature's ability to help you feel healthy, balanced and beautiful. Our products are thoughtfully crafted to harness the vitality of nature and work in harmony with your body's own restorative abilities. We are committed to building farming partnerships that honour the human spirit and respect the natural world.Weleda gains new UEBT certification and label for sourcing with respect Weleda is one of two leading beauty brands worldwide (the first in Europe) to obtain the new UEBT certification for sourcing with respect. UEBT (Union for Ethical Biotrade) is a non-profit organisation that provides a globally recognised standard for sustainable sourcing and the use of raw materials. UEBT certification will help consumers tell that they are buying products from a company that treats people and biodiversity with respect. Weleda has a responsibility for the environments in which it operates, and for the people involved in manufacturing Weleda products. Bas Schneiders, Head of International Strategic Sourcing at Weleda, commented: \"With certification we are taking the next step: creating a significant impact for the growers, collectors and producers working for us.\" In order for a brand to be certified, UEBT looks at its entire sourcing system. One part of the process is to validate that the brand has incorporated the requirements from the UEBT standard into its systems for sourcing and processing natural ingredients. Another part of the certification requirements concerns sourcing practices: certified companies need to verify that they have implemented these throughout the supply chains for their natural ingredients. \"We have received many awards in recent years for our efforts to achieve sustainability in our supply chains\", explained Annette Piperidis, Manager of Sustainable Sourcing at Weleda. \"Sustainability is not a goal for us, but rather a process which we constantly strive to optimize. For this reason, it was important to us to take our efforts to the next level and to tackle further challenges.\" Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT's Executive Director and a global expert on ethical sourcing of natural ingredients, added: \"We are so proud that Weleda has achieved ethical sourcing system certification by the UEBT and will be one of the first brands to place the UEBT trust mark on its products. By meeting our internationally recognised standard, a company assures customers that, when sourcing raw materials, biodiversity is conserved and sourced sustainably , and that all partners along the supply chain are treated equitably and paid fairly .\"Weleda became a full member of the Union for Ethical BioTrade in 2011. With its membership, Weleda reaffirmed its traditional principles of ethical business practice and applied the UEBT standard to its raw material procurement. UEBT values such as conservation, the sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair compensation of all partners in the supply chain, correspond with Weleda's own long-held principles. Jayn Sterland, managing director of Weleda UK, added: \"Weleda has pioneered sustainable business practices and Steiner's approach is inspiring a new generation of green entrepreneurs. At Weleda we believe, for instance, that value must be shared equally across the supply chain otherwise winners and losers are created and the system fails. Truly sustainable business practice is something which takes vision, dedication and daily commitment from everyone in the business.\" Each year Weleda publishes its annual Sustainability Report which highlights other efforts the company continues to make year on year to meet targets and reduce its impact on the planet. Here is just a snapshot of some of these latest updates:Weleda consists of 23 companies in over 50 countries across 5 continents. Weleda manages approximately 248 square km worldwide organically - the equivalent of 35,000 football pitches. Weleda has the largest medicinal plant gardens in Europe, home to over 1,000 different species of plant growing on 23 hectares, around 50 different types of bird and more than 30 species of wild bee. Over 120 plants are used, freshly picked, in tinctures for Weleda products. 30 tonnes of fresh arnica flowers generate 5 tonnes of dried flowers from which oil is extracted for use in Weleda's Arnica Massage Oil and Stretch Mark Massage Oil. Weleda is one of the world's largest buyers of organic raw materials. Over 1,000 natural ingredients go into Weleda products each year. Around 81% of all the plant ingredients Weleda uses are certified organic (over 2,000 tonnes). Weleda has over 50 long-term organic farming partnerships around the world. Weleda manufactures over 120 natural and organic cosmetics, and more than 1,000 pharmaceuticals. Weleda employs over 2,440 people worldwide. Weleda has 8 medicinal herb gardens around the world, all managed to strict biodynamic standards. 99% of the company's electricity used at the production facilities for manufacture of the Weleda range comes from renewable energy and continues to rise year on year. Over 98% of all waste produced during the manufacturing process is reused - either composted, repurposed, recycled or recovered (including thermal recovery). 85% of the glass used in Weleda's 100% recyclable glass bottles comes from recycled glass - the highest share of recycled glass possible. Weleda's product cartons are printed using mineral-oil-free colour inks. 250,000 fewer pack inserts were printed following the switch to peel-back labels on the body oils which provide additional product information on the reverse side. Energy intensity reduced by 4.5%, chiefly due to improved efficiency. Our target for a further reduction of water intensity by 2.5% was met. 8 9HG Skin FoodSkin Food Skin Food 10 11 Skin Food For everybody for everywhere.

Acne is caused by a bacterium called Propionibacterium acnes, which infects the skin pore and then forms a pimple. Currently, the most common treatments for acne are antibiotics or a topical cream or wash containing the chemical benzoyl peroxide. These treatments are often associated with side-effects, for example benzoyl peroxide often causes a burning sensation on the skin and irritation.

In 2009 Pablo Borboroglu founded the Global Penguin Society (GPS) - the world's first coalition for the protection of penguins. Using a multi-faceted approach that combines science, management and education, GPS protect penguins across the Southern Hemisphere and use them as a flagship for wider conservation of the marine environment.

Threatened by poor fisheries management, pollution and climate change in the oceans, penguins also face pressure on land from coastal development, irresponsible tourism and introduced predators. Pablo is spearheading large-scale action to address these threats; balancing local guardianship with strengthening national and international protection.ACCEPTED WASTE 32 33Weleda teams up with TerraCycle\u00ae At Weleda we are working hard behind the scenes to make our recyclable packaging even more sustainable with less waste, and using more recycled materials for packaging. Weleda's recyclable glass bottles are made from 85% recycled glass (the highest % possible). Weleda's roll-on deodorant bottles are made using 70% PCR (post consumer waste. Weleda's recyclable cartons are printed using mineral-oil-free colour inks on 100% FSC certified card. All Weleda's outer packing boxes are made from 100% recycled board. Four tonnes of material were saved in 2017 by optimising the weight of the screw caps for our recyclable aluminium tubes, and we've also recently reduced the amount of aluminium used in packaging and have introduced ABL (Aluminium Barrier Laminate) tubes for some new-launch products, a material which uses less aluminium. New packaging is currently in design using 100% recycled plastic. As detailed in Weleda's annual Sustainability Report, we're working towards a sustainability goal for 2022 that 65% of the weight of all primary packaging produced must come from bioplastics or recycled plastic sources. Achieving more through TerraCycle\u00ae We've teamed up with recycling experts TerraCycle\u00ae to ensure that all Weleda packaging can be recycled within the UK, even if some county council kerbside collection schemes don't accept certain mixed plastics. Whilst Weleda's glass bottles, aluminium tubes and plastic bottles are widely recyclable via local council kerbside collection schemes, some regions may not offer kerbside collection for the mixed plastics used in Weleda's 'soft touch' plastic tubes, even if they are technically recyclable, because sorting machinery and recycling facilities vary from county to county. Our soft touch tubes are made from a partially recycled mixed plastic, which is mainly 50% recycled HDPE (high density polyethylene). Through our partnership with TerraCycle\u00ae, customers can now return their empties to their local Weleda Wellbeing Advisor or collection point. TerraCycle\u00ae also awards points for the waste collected, which can then be redeemed for a charitable donation to charities and non-profit organisations. Downstream, the recycled plastics are then made into new products such as garden furniture.Working towards more sustainable packaging solutions All Weleda soft touch plastic tubes See the picture below for what you can recycle through this programme.

Weleda's organic pomegranate comes from the fertile valleys in the coastal region of Icel in southern Turkey. This thriving fair trade farming partnership ensures Weleda has a top quality supply of organic pomegranate, and guarantees the farmers a reliable income. Harvesting begins just after dawn, the crop is hand picked, carefully and laboriously, to ensure the best quality fruit. The juice is extracted for the food industry, and the seeds are then dried before they are cold pressed to extract the valuable oil for skincare. To produce just 1kg of the precious oil requires 500kg of pomegranates.

See our website for more information or call us and we'll send you a leaflet. Birch is renowned for its detoxification power. Full of flavonoids which encourage the body to flush out toxins, birch leaf extract helps to restore skin radiance from both inside and out. Weleda uses 500 tons of organic birch leaves a year, collected by our fair trade partners in the Czech Republic. A dermatological study* confirmed that when using Birch Cellulite Oil twice daily over 28 days in combination with Birch Juice, testers' skin was on average noticeably 35% firmer and skin elasticity improved by 20%. *The latest efficacy tests for Birch Cellulite Oil were conducted independently by Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte, Dermatologische Forschung GmbH, Hamburg, over 12 weeks, using Birch Juice for the first three weeks of the study.PURIFYING BIRCHBirch Skin Care Betula pendula Birch Cellulite Oil From a holistic standpoint, an increase in cellulite can indicate a build-up in toxins within the body - most of which are stored within the body's adipose (fatty) tissue. Regular massage and the use of specific cleansing and stimulating oils, can significantly improve the appearance of these areas - and support the body in its own process of internal cleansing. Weleda's Birch Cellulite Oil is a completely natural massage oil for areas of visible cellulite anywhere on the body such as thighs and buttocks. Extracts from organically grown birch, rosemary and butcher's broom stimulate the skin's metabolism, and are blended with active carrier oils, including vitamin rich wheat germ and nourishing jojoba. Invigorating essential oils of grapefruit and cypress provide the fragrance, and also work to uplift the mind, and energise the body. And it really works. A dermatological study confirmed that after using Birch Cellulite Oil twice daily over 28 days, testers' skin was on average noticeably 22% firmer, visibly 21% smoother and cellulite significantly reduced. 106112 100ml Ve \u00a325.95Birch Body Scrub Containing the gentlest of exfoliators - tiny beeswax pearls, with round, soft edges, Birch Body Scrub loosens dead skin cells without disturbing the healthy layers below. Healthy skin exfoliates naturally, so there's no need to use a scrub every day when your skin is in great condition. Birch Body Scrub is ideal for use weekly, to give your skin a boost and a glow. Our exfoliator pearls are suspended in a rich, creamy cleanser made from moisturising sesame seed oil, with birch extract to purify and tone the skin, citrus to refresh, and rosemary to stimulate the circulation. Recommended use: Once weekly 104021 150ml V \u00a39.95 Birch Juice A certified organic drink with birch leaf extract to gently cleanse the entire system - thereby restoring vitality and a healthy glow to skin. Organic lemon juice completes the tonic effect. Simply mix a tablespoonful with a glass of water, or add to pure apple juice. The Czech growers enjoy it for breakfast, stirred into yogurt! A dermatological study confirmed Birch Cellulite Oil used twice daily over 28 days in combination with Birch Juice, noticeably improved testers' skin, which appeared on average 35% firmer and skin elasticity improved by 20%. Visible improvement of skin-structure was recorded in 85% of cases, and testers' skin showed a healthy 20-25% increase in blood circulation/ microcirculation. 203000 250ml Ve \u00a310.95Body Brush Dry-brushing daily is a simple way to stimulate circulation and assist your body in flushing away toxins - a wonderful and very effective complement to daily massage. This beautiful wooden body brush is made from the Asian tree Schima superba, and has an organic cotton strap. Synthetic bristles make it vegan-friendly too. Start from the soles of your feet to promote optimal circulation and toxin-release - then brush up over the tops of the feet, over ankles, up the legs and dry-brush thighs, bottom and backs of legs with long upward strokes towards your heart. Circular clockwise strokes over your tummy and long brush strokes shoulders to fingertips (always towards the heart) complete a deeply invigorating daily pick- me-up. 408201 \u00a34.95Birch Cellulite Oil 49 48Edelweiss is a rare beauty. This small, noble plant, with its snow-white leaves and star-shaped inflorescence, grows at an altitude of 1,500 to 3,000 metres above sea level, under intense sunlight and on rocky ground. The plant's elongated leaves are completely covered with woolly white hairs. These tiny fluffy hairs carry thousands of tiny air bubbles that reflect the light. They are designed to absorb the precise wavelength of harmful UV radiation. The remaining sunlight can pass through so that the plant can undergo photosynthesis. The Edelweiss must also draw very strong vital forces out of the soil, which is very nutrient-poor at such altitude, in order to survive these intense conditions of cold, snow and intense sunlight. What a truly fascinating plant!Sun CareEDELWEISS SUN CARE Edelweiss Suncare Range 100 % MINERAL NON-NANO UV FILTERS 51 50The new Edelweiss Sun Care range offers instant and the highest possible protection for the whole family whilst safeguarding skin health and the environment. Containing non-nano mineral UV filters and inspired by the edelweiss flower and they way in which it protects itself from extreme conditions in the Swiss mountains. All products are NATRUE certified natural. Mineral based sunscreens The Edelweiss range is made with non-nano mineral UV filters. These physical UV filters offer immediate protection, reflecting the sun's harmful rays, and providing an alternative to conventional chemical sunscreens which can take some minutes to become effective. Not only skin-friendly, the Edelweiss range is also environmentally-friendly, something which is especially important when bathing in the sea or natural pools. The non- nano UV filters mean that the skin is left with a subtle white sheen, something that many parents find helpful when applying the creams to their children's skin as it's easy to spot areas that are not yet covered. With protection for baby, kids and adults, face or body, as well as after sun care, it's a complete range offering effective sun care for the whole family. These countless small mirrors - the mineral non-nano UV filters that reflect sunlight - are larger than 1 nanometre, and therefore visibly reflect sunlight. Weleda has deliberately refrained from using chemical or nano-sized UV filters and has developed mineral NATRUE-certified sunscreens to offer an alternative. So when mineral-based sunscreen is applied, it leaves a whitish sheen. The higher the sunscreen formulation's sun protection factor (SPF), the more prominently it whitens the skin. For babies and toddlers - who should wear sunscreen with a high SPF - this effect is not necessarily a drawback: parents can immediately see whether their children still have enough sunscreen on their skin and spot the areas of the skin that have not yet been covered. Weleda sunscreens are active immediately upon application, are waterproof and offer reliable and high UV protection - even for sensitive skin types and delicate baby skin. Effective mineral suncare Natural protection inspired by natureSun Care Nano vs Non-Nano exactly are mineral-based sunscreens? Mineral-based sunscreens reflect the sun's rays, like countless small mirrors, to protect the skin from sunburn. They contain minerals such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which can be used in different sizes to physically block the sun's UV rays. When the average size of these mineral particles is between 1 and 100 nanometres (1 nanometre = 1 billionth of a metre), they are referred to as nanoparticles. Do nanoparticles have harmful side effects? Nanoparticles should not be inhaled. Although nanoparticle- based sunscreens are classified as safe by the European Commission, many consumers have reservations about their use. There are also no conclusive results yet as to the influence of nanoparticles on our own organism, the human being. At Weleda in order to be able to offer a suitable alternative, we have deliberately decided to develop sunscreen products without nano-sized sunscreen ingredients. Weleda Edelweiss extract edelweiss, moisture preserving plant- based oils and non-nano mineral UV filters for reliable and skin-friendly protection for the whole family. Edelweiss Sunscreen Lotion - Factor 30 Sensitive This Baby & Kids Factor 30 sunscreen lotion cares for children's skin whilst protecting instantly.

Today no cosmetic sold in the EU can claim to be 'cruelty-free' on the packaging. We do test our products on real people, through extensive in-use monitored studies. We first test each ingredient for toxicology prior to use, and then test our formulations on human volunteers for skin tolerability. Animal testing is fundamentally against the underlying values and ethics of the NATRUE certification standard. The NATRUE criteria also extends the animal testing ban on finished cosmetic products to countries outside the EU. You will find the NATRUE seal on every one of our natural and organic cosmetics.CRUEL TY FREEAnimal testing We get asked all the time about animal testing and whether our natural and organic cosmetics are cruelty free. The answer is yes they most certainly are! Weleda has never tested any of its individual cosmetics ingredients nor finished beauty products on animals. We don't carry any cruelty free symbols on our packs because we have the NATRUE seal on every single one of our cosmetics. NATRUE is against animal testing; their criteria stipulates: \"Products must comply first and foremost with the basic requirements of Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, particularly with regard to their composition, safety, efficacy and labelling requirements. Furthermore, animal testing is fundamentally against NATRUE's underlying values and ethics. It is for this reason that the NATRUE criteria extends the animal testing ban on finished cosmetic products as regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 to countries outside the EU.\" Today thankfully it is against the law in Europe for any beauty cosmetics to be tested on animals so it goes without saying that, as a European beauty brand, our range is cruelty-free. But maybe it doesn't go without saying, as we hear some of you asking, what about mainland China where current regulation requires even imported European cosmetics to be tested on animals before they can be sold in China?The term 'cosmetics' in China is considered to be skincare, makeup, perfume, hair care, sun care, nail care, deodorants and whitening products. Strangely enough toothpastes and bars of soap are exempt, and as such they are not required to be tested on animals. So Weleda toothpaste and soaps may be found in China. But rest assured they are still cruelty-free. Cosmetics bought in China via an overseas e-commerce website also avoid the animal testing requirement, so increasingly Chinese customers are buying from online stores in Hong Kong and further afield in order to get hold of European green beauty brands. We do not sell our other products in mainland China because of the current cosmetics regulation, and there is no plan to do so until China changes its requirement regarding animal testing. Hopefully consumer pressure in China will bring about change before too long.Some of our products do contain animal products and their derivatives like beeswax, lanolin, goat's milk and lactose as well as honey in the elixirs which is why we do not say we are a Vegan company. If you wish to avoid any animal product here is our wide range of products that are suitable for Vegans. We make 100% certified natural and organic cosmeticsMember A contact of these products and their raw materials to material of animal origin during the manufacturing process cannot be ruled out entirely.Body Care Almond Sensitive Skin Hand Cream Arnica Massage Oil Arnica Cooling Gel Birch Cellulite Oil Citrus Refreshing Body Oil Citrus Hydrating Body Lotion Lavender Relaxing Body Oil Pomegranate Regenerating Body Oil Pomegranate Regenerating Body Lotion Pomegranate Regenerating Hand Cream Sea Buckthorn Replenishing Body Oil Sea Buckthorn Replenishing Body Lotion Skin Food Body Butter Wild Rose Pampering Body Lotion Deodorants Citrus 24h Roll-On Deodorant Citrus Deodorant Roll-On Deodorant Sea Buckthorn 24h Roll-On Deodorant Sage Deodorant Wild Rose Deodorant Hair Care Millet Nourishing Shampoo Oat Replenishing Shampoo Oat Replenishing Conditioner Revitalising Hair Tonic Wheat Balancing ShampooBath & Shower Almond Sensitive Skin Body Wash Arnica Muscle Soak Arnica Sports Shower Gel Calendula Soap Citrus Creamy Body Wash Citrus Refreshing Bath Milk Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo & Body Wash Happy Orange Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo & Body Wash Lively Lime Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo & Body Wash Mighty Mint Lavender Creamy Body Wash Lavender Relaxing Bath Milk Men Active Shower Gel Pine Reviving Bath Milk Pomegranate Creamy Body Wash Rosemary Invigorating Bath Milk Sea Buckthorn Creamy Body Wash Wild Rose Creamy Body Wash Wild Rose Cream Bath Sun Care Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion - Factor 50 Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion - Factor 30Facial Care Aknedoron Purifying Lotion Aknedoron Spot Treatment Aknedoron Refining Lotion Aknedoron Purifying Gel Cleanser Almond Soothing Cleansing Lotion Almond Soothing Facial Oil Evening Primrose Age Revitalising Day Cream Evening Primrose Age Revitalising Concentrate Gentle Cleansing Foam Gentle Cleansing Milk Pomegranate Firming Day Cream Pomegranate Firming Eye Cream Pomegranate Firming Face Serum Pomegranate Firming Night Cream Refining Toner Baby & Mum Calendula Baby Oil Calendula Bath Calendula Cream Bath Calendula Shampoo & Body Wash Children's Tooth Gel Nursing Oil Nursing Tea Perineum Massage Oil Stretch Mark Massage Oil Dental Children's Tooth Gel Calendula Toothpaste Plant Gel Toothpaste Ratanhia ToothpasteNatural Medicines Arnica Bumps & Bruises Spray Arnica Massage Balm Avena Sativa Comp Drops Calendula Cuts and Grazes Spray Cold Relief Oral Spray Copper Ointment Digestion Calming Drops Hayfever Relief Oral Spray Insect Bites Spray Muscular Pain Relief Oral Spray Rhinodoron Nasal Spray Skin Tone Lotion Stress Relief Oral Spray Wellbeing Birch JuiceVegan friendly 61 60HG * Always read the label Sports TherapySports Therapy Arnica Muscle Soak Arnica Cooling Gel Arnica Sports Shower GelArnica Massage OilArnica Massage Oil This oil is ideal for massage before and after sports, to keep muscles warm and flexible.

This concept is based on the link between the lead plant and the needs of the body. Hair and grains have many similarities, such as the way they grow, their surface and their structure. And just as grains can only grow in fertile earth, shiny hair can only grow on a healthy scalp. Tailored to the individual requirements of the respective hair type, Weleda provides the scalp and hair with exactly what it needs. The ingredients in our formulations all contribute to the effectiveness of the product. The unique fragrances derived from pure essential oils make our hair care an experience for all the senses. Our mild cleansing and caring products revitalise your scalp and give you naturally beautiful hair.HAIRCARE Oat Replenishing ShampooOat Replenishing Conditioner Rosemary Nourishing Hair Oil Rosemary Revitalising Hair Tonic HG \"Heavenly aroma, the Oat Replenishing Shampoo and Conditioner is brilliant for protecting dry hair .

Baby DermaBaby Skin Care Naturally soothing for hyper-sensitive baby skin As far back as ancient times, white mallow was highly regarded as a medicinal plant. Unlike many other plants, it feels warm and soft to the touch. It radiates softness and sensitivity, which is why it is well suited to skin that is sensitive or affected by baby eczema, an allergic skin condition characterised by dry, red and itchy skin. The anti-irritant properties of white mallow help calm and protect hypersensitive skin, relieving itching and promoting healthy skin development. The polysaccharides in its roots are particularly effective and, combined with water, form an organic gel which provides moisture, alleviates irritation and envelopes the skin in a soothing cocoon. Organic coconut oil, sourced sustainably from the Philippines, is a source of vitamin E which is essential for healthy skin growth and repair, keeping skin smooth and protecting against cracking. Recent research has shown its effectiveness in treating atopic dermatitis in paediatric patients.Made with ingredients traditionally used for treating childhood eczema, including wild pansy extract, white mallow and coconut oil.

One of the highest levels in the world.\" Annual & Sustainability Report 2017\"The harvest is a special time every year . Especially when you have followed the calendula growth from the very beginning. Each year we have new seasonal workers with very different personalities. The garden becomes the sum of every person who has worked here.\" Claire Hattersley Garden Development ManagerWe ensure the eco-system is balanced, planting in line with the biodynamic calendar; odd at first until you realise that the moon, sun and planets all affect the way a plant grows. Farming in this way isn't easy but it is well worth the extra effort we go to as our plants make potent tinctures from which we make your medicines. Weleda has the largest medicinal plant gardens in Europe, home to over 1,000 different species of plant growing on 23 hectares, around 50 different types of bird and more than 30 species of wild bee. Over 120 plants are used, freshly picked, in tinctures for Weleda products. We hand pick our gardeners too: Our gardeners are special folk. Their job is to nurture, ensuring the plant itself and its environment is healthy. We use our own seed bank as we believe this makes for plants most suited to our environment here in Derbyshire. We use traditional farming methods as it makes sense to rotate our growing beds annually and we combine wisdom from our many seasons of gardening, creating active composts to feed the soil from our own plant materials; we make our own biodynamic garden preparations from our natural materials which we spray in the Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Our aim is to grow the healthiest of plants, always.To ensure the best quality ingredients we grow our own plants in herb gardens in Derbyshire. There we grow to biodynamic\u00ae standards, which is a form of farming we call \"super-organic\" - it isn't just about how the plants are grown it's also about where and when we grow them.

Our Weleda gardeners meet and greet Duncan early doors and take delivery of his precious cargo. Every member of staff at Weleda knows when it's 'Arnica Day' and are ready to chip in as and when they are required. It is critical the arnica plants are processed as soon as possible in order to capture the plant's vitality. Arnica soon passes from the outside world of the garden to a cleaner world of tincture production and manufacturing , outdoor clothing is exchanged for whites and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) rules. Our gardeners keenly check each plant, before shredding ensues and the moisture content is measured. Organic grain alcohol and purified water quantities are calculated and then gradually mixed with the shredded arnica. The gardeners then ensure that the fresh macerate is allowed to infuse for two weeks with occasional stirring. The vessel is emptied, contents pressed and 50% arnica tincture is created and is now ready to use. The large guisti is primed, ready to receive potassium olivate, birch leaf extract, lavender and rosemary essential oils and fresh arnica tincture, all vital ingredients in our award-winning Arnica Muscle Soak. The same active ingredients with their synergistic effect, are combined together to create medicinal Arnica Massage Balm and warming Arnica Massage Oil, firm favourites of rugby teams, mountaineers, ballet dancers and enthusiastic gardeners. Arnica is a welcome sight post marathon running or any physical activity that renders the muscle a little weary. Ideally, for the full arnica effect, opt for an oral preparation together with external application so arnica can work from the inside out and the outside in. Arnica is an alpine plant and for this reason it does not thrive in our lowland Derbyshire soil at 'The Field'. Instead, Weleda obtains Scottish-grown and biodynamically cultivated arnica from the grower, Duncan Ross. Each year Duncan makes a ten-hour drive with a freshly-harvested crop. The day before the crop arrives, Duncan and four other gardeners are busy, carefully lifting each arnica plant, roots and all (planta tota), washing the roots and removing any discoloured and broken leaves. The plants are then placed upright in boxes, with their roots in fresh water, ready for the journey to Weleda Head Office. In the cool twilight hours, he sets off transporting around 100 kilos of whole fresh plants. Our gardeners scrub-down and gown-up to meet the stringent rules we work to in our pharmaceutical laboratories. 92 93You'll be able to experience Skin Food first hand as our Nice Cream Van tours the country - look out for it at a multitude of music, food and family festivals and outdoor gatherings, then come and say hello for free samples and special offers.

Once a year in July we open up our Derbyshire gardens to the public and give our friends and families guided tours and a sneak peek behind the scenes. There is always a fantastic 'festival' feel and lots to see and do, at the time of the year when our gardens are looking truly resplendent. We also hold plant study days, soil workshops and educational sessions with our experts that are designed to give attendees an introduction to biodynamic gardening.

As well as planting a tree with every purchase, we've done our very best to minimise the carbon impact of the whole project. The board is made with a large element of post- consumer recycled material, the remainder being FSC compliant, printed with solvent free vegetable inks and is of course fully and easily recyclable... we even arranged for a printer local to our UK head office to complete the work so even the delivery impact was minimal. We hope you agree, we have reconciled the challenge of creating desirable gifts that are a pleasure to give and receive, but also leave everyone with a clear conscience. 104 105Price List Code DESCRIPTION PAGE SIZE CAT RRSP Almond Facial Care 102201 Almond Soothing Cleansing Lotion P21 75ml Ve \u00a311.95 Soothing Facial Cream Soothing Facial Oil Almond Soothing Facial Lotion V \u00a317.95 Facial Care \u00a317.95 Wild Rose Facial Care 102221 Smoothing Facial Lotion P25 30ml 10ml V \u00a323.50 Pomegranate Facial Care Pomegranate Firming Day Cream P27 30ml Ve \u00a328.95 Firming Night Firming Facial 50 P52 50ml Ve 101993 Sunscreen Lotion P52 150ml Body Almond Body Lotion P37 \u00a316.95Code DESCRIPTION SIZE CAT RRSP Birch Body Scrub Body Wash P77 150ml Ve \u00a35.95 104560 Lively Lime kids Body Wash P77 150ml Ve \u00a35.95 104561 Happy Orange kids 2in1 Shampoo Body Wash P77 150ml Ve \u00a35.95 Bath Milks 104005 P39, P59 Ve Bath Milk P55 50ml Ve \u00a37.95 Intensive Care for Hands, Feet, Lips and Body 106016 Foot Balm P67 75ml V Light 100ml \u00a312.95 V = Vegetarian Ve = Vegan and VegetarianG = Contains Gluten D = Not suitable for diabetics= Hostess Gift HGCode DESCRIPTION PAGE SIZE CAT RRSP \u00a37.95 Skin Food - Starter Kit P101 V \u00a313.00 409406 Skin Food - Trio Well Ve Set Natural 6X Tablets P91 125 tabs or find out more, visit www.weleda.co.uk Speak to us, please call 0115 944 8200 To find your local wellbeing advisor, please visit www.weleda.co.uk/findanadvisor To join us on social, you'll find us at: Weleda UK Ltd, Heanor "}
