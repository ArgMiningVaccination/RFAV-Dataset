Andrea Azc\u00e1rate-Peril, a director at the Microbiome Core Facility at the University of North Carolina. Quite literally. With bacteria and other microbes vastly outnumbering the human cells in our bodies, we're more bacteria than human. Our bodies can't function properly without them. They support our immune system, help us process and absorb nutrients, and [lower the risk many conditions](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-017-1175-y) - obesity - heart disease - diabetes - cancer - mental health and mood conditions Many chronic and autoimmune diseases have also been linked to a microbiotic imbalance \u2014 or [dysbiosis](/health/digestive-health/dysbiosis). This just means: Trust your gut when it's feeling funny and revisit the state of your health. Most people already have an idea of how healthy their gut is, according to Dr. Ami Bhatt, an assistant professor and researcher at Stanford University. She says that the intestinal microbiome \"really does lend itself to people doing experiments on themselves and figuring out what works for them.\" There are roughly [100 trillion bacteria](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-gut-bacteria-improve-your-health) in the digestive system alone. It may seem like a tall order to change them, but the good news is that your microbiome can quickly change. [Research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957428/) So what are you waiting for? Follow this 3-day fix to build and diversify your gut army and support lasting change for the better. When to wake up Let your body wake up naturally Sleeping in line with your body's natural circadian rhythm is important for [good sleep](/nutrition/10-reasons-why-good-sleep-is-important) and a healthy gut. \"The gut microbiota has a circadian rhythm like we do,\" said Azc\u00e1rate-Peril. \"Our gut microbiota will fluctuate in terms of composition and abundance based on our rhythm of when we eat and sleep. If that circadian rhythm is disrupted, we are going to have issues. We don't want to interrupt that cycle.\" What to eat today Ditch the Western diet A diet that's high in animal protein, sugar, and fat, and low in fiber \u2014 like the diets full of [processed foods](/health/food-nutrition/processed-foods-to-avoid) that are popular in the United States \u2014 have been shown to [decrease the amount of bacteria in the gut](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-017-1175-y) [The Western diet](/health-news/has-modern-western-diet-damaged-our-health) has also been linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, and even certain cancers. Go Mediterranean A [recent review](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-017-1175-y) [Mediterranean diet](/health/food-nutrition/Mediterranean-diet-recipes#1), which follows these recommendations? Stick to one glass of red wine or dark chocolate Other types of alcohol [can harm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3362077/) [red wine](/nutrition/red-vs-white-wine) has been shown of polyphenols](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22552027) What are polyphenols? Polyphenols are plant compounds that have been linked to health benefits like and [lowering blood pressure] [cholesterol]. Many polyphenols aren't absorbed by the body and instead end up being [digested by bacteria in the gut]. What to do today Try to stop smoking, if you do [A small study from 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597605/) [vaping](/health-news/new-studies-conclude-e-cigarettes-are-not-healthy) activities too. Go for a 30-minute run or workout Add gut health to the list of reasons you should hit the gym. While the gut-exercise connection isn't yet clear, many researchers believe that [exercise reduces stress](/health/heart-disease/exercise-stress-relief) hormones, which affect the microbes in your gut. A [small study](http://gut.bmj.com/content/63/12/1913) found that exercise alters intestinal bacteria in humans and increases microbial diversity. A [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29166320) When to sleep: 11 p.m. [Sleep deprivation](/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body) has been found to [alter the bacteria in your gut](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945717303179). Go to bed early \u2014 at least 30 minutes before you normally do on a weekday \u2014 for quality sleep. When to wake up: 7:30 a.m. Get up earlier so you're not preparing your body for a late start on Monday. What to eat today Add high-fiber foods to every meal [Fiber is key to a happy gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26757793) [Indigestible fiber](/nutrition/different-types-of-fiber), aka prebiotics, boost the bacteria you already have instead of adding new bacteria, like probiotics. [Feed the bacteria in your gut ](/nutrition/19-best-prebiotic-foods)with: - raspberries - green peas - broccoli - beans - lentils - whole grains They'll help support beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria. Cut added sugar The microbes in your belly love sugar just as much as you do, but the results aren't great. Simple sugars feed bacteria and can lead to overgrowths of less beneficial or harmful bacteria and reduce diversity. Check out the [ingredient list](/nutrition/56-different-names-for-sugar) in breads, sauces, and condiments and keep your daily intake under the [recommended limit](/nutrition/how-much-sugar-per-day) of 37.5 grams (g) for men and 25 g for women. Have a glass of kombucha [Fermented foods](/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods) contain beneficial live bacteria. Some examples include: These probiotic foods can help [improve intestinal health and digestion](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-017-1175-y) [supporting and introducing](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/19490976.2014.983775?src=recsys&) beneficial microbes. When choosing fermented foods, be sure to pick items that are low in sugar like unsweetened yogurt. What to do today \"We live in a society that is too clean,\" said Azc\u00e1rate-Peril. \"We are not exposed to enough microbes during childhood, so we are not properly educating our immune systems.\" Play with a pet [Studies](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/805) have found that exposure to pets as infants and children can: - reduce the risk of developing allergies - support a healthy immune system - encourage a diverse microbiome But that doesn't mean that adults don't benefit from the fuzzy snuggles, too. Get dirty Garden. Play outside. Lounge on the grass. Exposure to the natural microbes around us can help replenish our microbiota and encourage diversity. It's probably not wise to go around licking subway poles or eating undercooked chicken, but most of us could benefit from a little less 'cleanliness.' When to sleep: 11 p.m. Keep the early bedtime to wake up refreshed tomorrow and stay in sync with your circadian rhythm. When to wake up: 6:30 a.m. Try to get up at least 7 hours after you went to bed to bank a full night's rest. What to eat today Try a meatless Monday Diets that are loaded with fruits and veggies and low in meat have been [linked to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3571646/) [increase the abundance](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-017-1175-y) [linked to inflammatory bowel disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957428/) the artificial sweeteners in your coffee [Studies](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-017-1175-y) [artificial sweeteners](/nutrition/artificial-sweeteners-and-gut-bacteria) like [sucralose](/nutrition/sucralose-good-or-bad), [saccharin](/nutrition/saccharin-good-or-bad), and [aspartame](/health/aspartame-side-effects) can change the balance of bacteria and reduce the amounts of beneficial bacteria in the gut. These microbial changes are believed to be the reason why artificial sweeteners [drive glucose intolerance](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13793) Drink two extra glasses of water Proper hydration is key to keeping food moving through your intestines properly, and this movement is vital for a healthy gut. What to do today Throw out your antibacterial toothpaste, dental floss, and mouthwash [Antibacterial chemicals](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/19490976.2014.983775?src=recsys&) can cause antibacterial-resistant microbes and [harm beneficial bacteria](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584909000288?via%3Dihub) in your mouth. A small [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584909000288?via%3Dihub) found that changes in the bacteria in your mouth can impact how well you absorb nutrients like nitrite which has been shown to [lower blood pressure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584909000288?via%3Dihub). Destress Stress [reduces beneficial bacteria and increases harmful bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22314561) Chronic stress is particularly dangerous because it may increase intestinal permeability (also known as [leaky gut](/nutrition/is-leaky-gut-real)) and allows the gut microbiota to go where they shouldn't, causing inflammation. When to sleep: 11 p.m. Keep up a healthy sleep pattern and go to bed early to wake up sharp tomorrow. Even partial sleep deprivation can [alter your microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641593) [reduce your cognitive function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945717303179). A healthy, low stress lifestyle with an emphasis on sleep, exercise, and plant-based foods is the best way to support a healthy gut. But if you're only going to stick with one thing: Change your diet to include more whole foods and fresh vegetables. This will have the single biggest impact. For the rest of the week: - Mix it up and [try new foods](/health/food-nutrition/ways-to-eat-kelp-or-seaweed). Eating diverse foods leads to a happier gut and . [a more diverse microbiota](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837298/) - Skip harsh, aggressive cleaners like bleach and use natural cleaners like soap and water instead. - Take antibiotics only when absolutely necessary. - Exercise regularly. While your microbiome may change quickly with what you eat, there are no quick fixes or overnight miracle workers for a healthy gut. Instead, it's about sticking to the small changes that add up. \"Our microbiome is a mirror of our lifestyle,\" said Bhatt. \"We need to enact healthy lifestyles over the long term if we are going to see that reflected in our microbiome.\" Mandy Ferreira is a writer and editor in the San Francisco Bay Area.
