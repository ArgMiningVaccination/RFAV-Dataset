Take action to treat rotavirus in your foals and prevent it from spreading in the future. Monitor foals for signs of the virus, which include diarrhea, loss of appetite, and low energy. Always isolate infected foals from the rest of your horses, disinfect contaminated areas, and follow treatment guidelines provided by your veterinarian. Prevention of the virus is your best bet, so consider vaccinating your pregnant mares to stop rotavirus in its tracks. Steps Identifying the Virus - 1Monitor your foals for signs of diarrhea. Diarrhea is the most common and recognizable symptom of rotavirus. Observe your foals' elimination and look for any incidences of soft feces or runny, watery diarrhea. The feces of foals infected with rotavirus are often yellow or green/gray. [[1]](#_note-1)X Research source - You may not notice actual droppings if your horse has very wet diarrhea. Instead, look for wet rears and tails, as well as crusty areas below the tail. - Diarrhea can also be attributed to parasites, lactose intolerance, overfeeding, antibiotics, the ingestion of foreign material, or foal heat diarrhea. - 2Check to see if your foals are eating. Loss of appetite and anorexia are other symptoms of rotavirus that you can look for. If you do not see a foal nursing, check its mother's udder. If the udder is full, the mare's foal is not nursing as it should be. [[2]](#_note-2)X Research source - 3Observe your foals' energy levels. Depending on their age and wellness, foals may be hit differently by the virus. Keep an eye on your foals to see how much they move around, interact, and play. Foals who are several months old may be more resilient when infected, while younger foals (i.e. two weeks old or younger) may lack the strength to cope as well. [[3]](#_note-3)X Research source - Foals may seem lethargic due to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. They may also be seen standing by themselves in the field, refusing to nurse, refusing to play, or showing a lack of interest in their surroundings. - 4Use a human rotavirus test kit. Test kits designed to quickly identify rotavirus in human can also be used to diagnose rotavirus in foals. Ask your veterinarian about the test. If your vet cannot complete the test in a timely manner, you may be able to purchase one yourself online or from a medical supply store. The dipstick test should be applied to fecal matter of the potentially infected foal. However, a vet test should always be your first choice. [[4]](#_note-4)X Research source Advertisement - Results should be evident within fifteen minutes of conducting the test. Treating Infected Foals - 1Contact your veterinarian. While diarrhea caused by rotavirus is often harmless and temporary, young foals may become dehydrated or develop gastrointestinal ulcers if the virus progresses. Have your foals checked by a veterinarian to make sure they make a full recovery. The vet may give your foals I.V. fluids and tube feed them if necessary to build their strength and fight the virus.

Bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol, coats the lining of the stomach and intestines to soothe them and prevent damage caused by the virus. It is prescribed in either suspension or paste form and should be administered to foals orally using a syringe. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source - 3Treat the irritated skin between their hind legs. Foals suffering from diarrhea are likely to suffer skin irritation between their hind legs, which is a sensitive area. Cleanse your infected foals' skin at least once a day with a gentle soap to remove fecal matter and prevent bacterial infection. Apply mineral oil or diaper rash cream to the area as a barrier to prevent sores. [[7]](#_note-7)X Research sourceAdvertisement Preventing the Spread of Rotavirus - 1Separate the infected foals from the healthy ones. If you learn that your foal is infected, keep them away from other young horses. You'll also want to separate them from pregnant females, so they don't transfer the virus to their baby. Place foals suffering from rotavirus in their own paddock to ensure that other horses do not come in contact with their manure. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source - Infected foals may be contagious for as long as ten days, so keep them away for that long to be safe. - Avoid moving infected foals to an entirely different section of your farm, which will simply spread the virus to areas it has not touched yet. - 2Ensure newborns get enough colostrum. Colostrum, which occurs in the early days of lactation, is full of antibodies that help build a newborn foal's immune system. Make sure newborn foals are nursing regularly in their first days to help strengthen their immune systems and build up their resistance to rotavirus. - 3Wear gloves to handle the infected foals. When working with your infected foals, wear gloves at all times. Dispose of the gloves after every interaction. Wash your hands thoroughly as an additional measure. - To fully prevent the spread of the virus, consider wearing shoe coverings and a protective gown (available at medical supply stores) each time you handle infected foals. [[9]](#_note-9)X Research source - To fully prevent the spread of the virus, consider wearing shoe coverings and a protective gown (available at medical supply stores) each time you handle infected foals. - 4Disinfect contaminated areas. To prevent the spread of rotavirus, it is important to disinfect areas, tools, and objects that have come in contact with infected foals (e.g., grooming supplies). Use a phenolic disinfectant soap to thoroughly wash down and rinse contaminated sites. Note that bleach does not kill rotavirus and will be ineffective in ridding your farm of it. - Phenolic disinfectants can be purchased online or from medical and farming supply stores. - Throw away any contaminated bedding or hay. - 5Vaccinate pregnant mares. Consult your veterinarian about vaccinating your mares while they are pregnant to immunize unborn foals against rotavirus. The immunization consists of three shots administered at the eighth, ninth, and tenth months of pregnancy. Your veterinarian can administer the full treatment for about 45-55 dollars per mare, which is likely less expensive than the cost of treating infected foals. [[10]](#_note-10)X Research source Advertisement - Try to get all your pregnant mares vaccinated on the same schedule to provide the most complete protection possible.
