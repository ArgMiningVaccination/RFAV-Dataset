Porcelain bust ofHahnemann, with inscription under left shoulder, copied from a sculpture byGerman artist, Anton Dietrich.31The Hahnemann House future ofhomeopathy, wealso play akey role in preserving the legacy of this remarkable medicine and itsfounder Dr Samuel Hahnemann. Homeopathy UK is trustee of the Hahnemann House Trust (HHT), acharity founded in1967 collection ofletters, books and personal artefacts belonging toDrHahnemann which can be viewed free ofcharge inavirtual museum atwww .hahnemannhouse .org. Most sons ofPeter Stuart, alay homeopath who studied with DrJohn Epps, one ofthe earliest followers ofHahnemann. Peter bought a number of Hahnemann's belongings when they came up for sale in 1878 and the collection has been added toover the years through legacies, or items bought through donation to the HHT. Today, the collection ranges from abook archive toHahnemann's mahogany bed, paintings, photographs and jewellery. Iteven includes adrawing of Hahnemann's death mask -a cast made of his face when he died - aswell as a jewellery chain made from what is believed to be Hahnemann's own hair. Inaddition, the museum houses items owned byother key figures from homeopathy's past, including amachine formaking high potency remedies dated from 1878. Another exhibit isanearly sphygmograph - the precursor tothe modern pressure monitor -invented in1882 byhomeopathic doctor DrRobert Dudgeon . This year, member organisations shared information across social media outlining some ofthe ways homeopathy can help boost physical and emotional wellbeing. Central tothis was anonline campaign topromote aspecially commissioned animation entitled \"This isHomeopathy!\" - animaginative depiction ofthree real patients sharing their positive experiences ofhomeopathy -Atul (family health), Rebecca (eczema and allergies) and Mary (dog health). The film was shared online via 4Hmember organisations, who encouraged their supporters topost itontheir own social media accounts. 4Halso ran adigital advertising campaign toboost the reach ofthe video, which had delivered 66,345 impressions, 563 clicks and 2,914 views bythe end ofthe campaign. 32Our partnerships This year wehave continued tocollaborate with sector colleagues via the 4Homeopathy coalition. Inparticular, wehave worked hard toensure that there isconsistent messaging around Covid -19and the role of homeopathy inthe context ofthe pandemic. 10-16April Homeopathy Awareness Week 2021 Homeopathy Awareness Week isanannual activity which promotes homeopathy toawider audience, aswell asengaging the professional homeopathic community. UKalso invited several homeopaths totake part inshort video messages which were shared extensively across social media. Aswell asoffering tips onmanaging anxiety and stress during lockdown, the videos provided practical advice onarange ofissues, including family First Aid, allergies and the immune system. Homeopathy and Covid -19 Asaresult ofenquiries from the public about homeopathy and Covid -19 during the first lockdown, weproduced ajoint statement with the Faculty ofHomeopathy entitled \"Homeopathy and vaccination are separate issues\". Whilst stressing the importance offollowing UK government guidance, we highlighted that homeopathy has a long history of supporting patients with influenza -like symptoms. Inaddition, we pointed out that doctors around the world were successfully using homeopathy alongside conventional medicine totreat the symptoms ofCovid -19. The statement remains apopular destination page onour website. The ongoing pandemic has also presented some further challenges in the form ofnegative media articles about homeopathy, some ofwhich originated from social posts . Inorder tooffset apotential reputational risk, wewrote toall practitioners involved with our charitable clinics - together with a copy ofour Social Media Policy -urging caution and restraint when posting on social media.34The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) The ASA investigated acomplaint made about the wording inthe Condition Directory ofour website. Itwas very unusual forHomeopathy UKtoreceive such acomplaint and itwas the first time our website became subject toanASA enquiry. We have taken this complaint seriously. The main complaint related to articles inthe Conditions Directory section ofthe Homeopathy UKsite where doctors and other medically trained professionals share their experience ofhow homeopathy can help depression, diabetes, infertility, psoriasis and asthma. The ASA informed usthat the complaint was based onthe premise that the articles \"discouraged essential treatment forconditions forwhich medical supervision should besought\". The idea that, after reading our website, someone might decline essential medical treatment isastroubling asitisunlikely. Not least because weknow the people who visit the site tobediscerning and intelligent people who are able tomake informed choices about their own healthcare. We highlighted the fact that the articles inquestion are all written byhighly trained medical professionals registered with the General Medical Council aswell asadditional registering bodies associated with their specialism. Farfrom discouraging essential treatment, these articles show how registered health professionals used homeopathy alongside conventional medicine tooffer patients additional therapeutic opportunities. Whilst H-UKadhered tothe ASA's ruling, weshared our views publicly viaastatement onour website. The post was read over 1,600 times inthe first 5days following publication. The post closed with the apt words which sums upHomeopathy UK's stance, \"whatever the obstacles, weremain committed tospreading accurate information about homeopathy, defending patients' rights and providing access to treatment where it'smost needed.\"35 36Working with international colleagues The practice of homeopathy by doctors and other health professionals isunder threat inanumber ofcountries around the world, resulting in serious challenges topatient rights. Byworking collaboratively with international partners, we aim to meet the shared objective of supporting nations where homeopathy is under threat and ensure that patients can retain access tohomeopathic medicine. We are members ofEFHPA (European Federation ofHomeopathic Patients' ontheir isthe organisation's liaison with The European Committee forHomeopathy. The European Committee forHomeopathy (ECH) represents organisations across Europe that represent homeopathic doctors. Both Cristal and Margaret Wyllie (H-UKChair) sitonthe ECH Margaret isco-coordinator ofthe ECH's Both organisations have been working hard toimprove homeopathy's reputation in the media. This has been achieved by sharing patient stories, aswell aspromoting new research focusing onthe benefits of anintegrated healthcare approach -One World, One Health -aworld with healthier people integrating natural approaches with mainstream healthcare, creating better health outcomes and being kinder to the planet. The issues ofsustainability and antimicrobial resistance mean that governments need to look at all approaches to healthcare management toachieve the best outcome forall.Homeopathy isan important part ofthe solution and these European bodies are working hard tocommunicate that message.4.3 Supporting research & training38Supporting research &training Since 2016 Homeopathy UKhas awarded grants tosupport research and help build the growing evidence base into homeopathy .Our Grants Committee did not meet toreview applications in2021.
