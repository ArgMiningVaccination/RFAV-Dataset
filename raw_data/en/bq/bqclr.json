During exercise or excitement it may beat a bit faster. However, if you're suffering from cardiac arrhythmia or abnormal heartbeat, you will experience dizziness and vertigo and may even black out. Cardiac arrhythmia may occur in anyone, male or female, at any age. If it goes unnoticed, it may lead to a risk of paralysis. Another heart abnormality is atrial fibrillation (AF)\u2014better known as a heart attack. AF is dangerous and it's hard to rehabilitate the patient back to normal. Internal causes for heart disease include: - Degenerative change (due to the normal aging process), - Electrolyte imbalance, - Structural heart disease such as congenital heart malformation, abnormal heart muscle thickness, etc. - Brugada Syndrome and abnormal thyroid hormone levels. External factors include hot temperatures, stress, over-work, lack of rest, alcohol consumption and smoking. There is a wide range of nutritional supplements available on the market - produced both domestically and abroad - which can have a number of adverse side effects that can contribute to the development of arrhythmia. Consumers must therefore study each product in detail and be sure to understand its potential effects before taking it. "}
