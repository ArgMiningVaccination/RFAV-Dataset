The importance of vaccination programmes for women's health care globally Vaccines are among the most successful and cost-effective health interventions in medical history. Vaccinations save millions of lives every year, yet women and girls often lack access to crucial vaccines. They are an essential part of women's and girls' health care, yet many barriers affecting implementation of vaccination programmes remain. Knowledge gaps, misinformation among women and communities, and research gaps - such as for vaccination in pregnancy - all contribute to women and girls' insufficient access to vaccines. These are exacerbated by inadequate access to health care as well as the persistent inequalities based on gender, lack of trained health providers, or structure of health systems. Strategies for vaccination programme implementation have to be adapted to each setting, as they must be based on cultural, economic, and personnel realities. Significant effort must be put into structuring plans upfront to ensure the success of the strategy as well as its iterative improvement. Six key areas should be considered before introduction or implementation: vaccine availability; vaccine policies; inventory and supply chain; vaccine delivery; procurement; and vaccine acceptability. Global elimination of cervical cancer and saving the lives of pregnant women and their offspring is within our grasp. It is our responsibility as obstetricians and gynaecologists to educate key stakeholders and to advocate for the implementation of sustainable vaccination programmes for women and girls. FIGO will continue to provide global leadership so that we can see a future where all women are immunised. - Dr Eliana Amaral, Chair, FIGO Committee on Infections During Pregnancy The role of FIGO and its members in promoting vaccination for women's health [This supplement](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/18793479/2023/162/S1) explores present knowledge in the areas of implementation and communication strategies to enhance the success of vaccination programmes for women globally, with a particular focus on HPV prevention and vaccination during pregnancy. FIGO member societies can play a significant role in assuring lifelong vaccination success for women's health through research, advocacy, training, curriculum development, and inter- professional collaboration impacting women's health policies. FIGO can act as a connector to support member societies to design plans and serve as a clearing house for resources and experience. FIGO's members have the scientific credibility and community standing to become important partners in the implementation of lifesaving vaccinations in every setting for the lifelong health of women.
