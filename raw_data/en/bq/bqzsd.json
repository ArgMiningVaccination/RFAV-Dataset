Approve the exec ution of interim contracts while the contracts and exhibits to carry over the key provisions from the prior fiscal year to allow for provision of services for the time periods noted above while ACBH is working to negotiate and execute the final contracts in the first part of the new fiscal year in amounts not to exceed those indicated in Recommendation s A and B; and E. Delegate authority to the Agency Director or designee to negotiate and execute the agreements and amendments indicated in Recommendations A , B, and C through the Community -Based Organization master contract process subject to review and approval as to form by County Counsel and submit executed copies to the Clerk of the Board for filing . DISCUSSION/SUMMARY Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBH) is requesting approval to execute interim contracts as needed and/or negotiate exhibits for procurement contracts with the Community -Based Organizations (CBOs) indicat ed above, subject to the adoption of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022-23 Final Budget. This Board letter represents the ACBH Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Continuum of Care which support s local individuals and families who are at increased risk for or experiencing serious issues related to their use or abuse of alcohol and other drugs . Your Board's approval is essential to providing uninterrupted services and continuity of care to clients. Your Board has traditionally approved th ese request s for extension of existing services into a new fi scal year through new contracts and/or modest augmentations to account for higher costs of providing the same level of services to allow the department to negotiate final contracts with the approved budget allocations for the new fiscal year without negatively impacting the members of the community s erved by these CBOs. Your Board approved these contracts identified in Recommendations A and B for Fiscal Year 202 2 on May 25, 2021 (Item No. 9) and on July 13, 2021 (Item No 6) . In addition to the above, y our Board's approval of additional multi -year con tracts will enhance efficiency and is responsive to provider requests for this as a strategy to allow them more time to focus on the provision of quality care to clients. The Honorable Board of Supervisors May 10 , 202 2 Page 3 of 4 The CBOs indicated in Recommendations A and B provide substance use services to over 1,000 clients each month . This includes the provision of outpatient treatment for approximately 800 c lients , residential treatment for approximately 250 clients, recovery residence for nearly 100 clients and sobering center services for nearly 200 clients . These substance use programs serve between 82% and 123% of the clients they are contracted to serve each month, with some variation between the service modalities. Additionally, support services are provided to clients and the broader community through p revention , transition -to-treatment and the Substance Use Access and Referral Helpline. These program s deliver specialized services to adolescents and adults and include tailored programs for special populations such as women who are pregnant and/or parenti ng, and older adults . ACBH also has Services -as-Needed (SAN) contracts with CBOs to provide State -certified opioid treatment services to DMC eligible, opioid dependent clients in Alameda County. Your Board approved to transition a pilot group of provider s, including these opioid treatment providers, to a multi -year contracting period in order to address the administrative burden of the annual contract renewal process on December 21, 2021 (Item No. 7). The utilization of these programs has varied substanti ally in recent years, particularly with Alameda County's entry into the DMC ODS Waiver and the associated requirement for ACBH to establish contractual arrangements with out -of-County opioid treatment programs that may serve eligible DMC beneficiaries resi ding in Alameda County. These SAN contracts allow the ACBH Director or designee to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to changes in utilization across contracted opioid treatment programs and meet emerging requirements related to DMC -ODS. ACBH prov ides opioid treatment to over 1 ,400 clients monthly. Per the regulations under SAGB and DMC funding , ACBH conducts annual site visits and audits of contracted providers. Of the seventeen providers receiving SABG funding (forty -four programs) , 88% were fo und to be in compliance for all quality indicators monitored during the virtual site visits conducted in FY 21 -22. This included quality indicators related to written policies and procedures, personnel files, and accessibility of key materials . Only two pr oviders were placed on a co ntract compliance plan for not meeting the full threshold of quality requirements and those deficient items have since been rectified . The identification and addressing of identified deficiencies support quality of services and the documentation of compliance in future audits. ACBH identified a phase -in plan for multi -year contracts in fall 202 1, and a summary was presented in our December 21, 2021 Board Letter requesting approval for the multi -year pilot involving the opioid tr eatment providers identified in Recommendation C. The phase -in plan for multi -year contracts involves cohorts of more simple contracts with stable allocations being phased in first, with some of the larger and more complex contracts being identified for su bsequent phase -in, with a subset of the most large and complex ACBH contracts likely to continue moving forward on a single -year basis. SELECTION CRITERIA This is a request to continue existing ACBH contracted services into the new fiscal year (s) under n ew contracts or modest augmentations to existing contracts. ACBH released Request for Proposal (R FP) for D rug Med -Cal Organized Delivery System (D MC-ODS ) Waiver services on February 8, 2018. There were 18 separate competitive processes under this RFP. Your Board approved contracts for these services on Ju ly 24, 2018 (Item No. 1 0), on August 7, 2018 (Item No. 8) and on September 18, 2018 (Item No. 14) . ACBH released RFP No. 19 -11 Primary Prevention Services for Youth on December 3, 2019. Your Board app roved contracts for these services on July 14 , 2020 (Item No. 6). ACBH released another RFP No. 20 -06 Primary Prevention Services for Youth and Friday Night Live services on September 29, 2020. Your Board approved contracts for these services on July 1 3, 2021 (Item No. 6). The Honorable Board of Supervisors May 10 , 202 2 Page 4 of 4 The selection of other providers of substance use services occurred under prior competitive procurement processes, such as the RFP for Primary Prevention Services for Older Adults, or for a very small subset of programs the former Alame da County Alcohol and Drug Department which pre-dates the formation of ACBH. ACBH has developed an initial plan for procurement, for programs such as those whose selection pre -dates the formation of ACBH, and is currently in the early stages of an implemen tation process to conduct a dditional competitive bidding procurement process es for these services. It is ACBH's intent to stage the various procurement processes to ensure the least amount of disruption in client care. ACBH acts as a fiscal administrator for DMC funds for opioid treatment services on behalf of the State and was not involved in the original selection of these providers. ACBH requests that Your Board allows these providers to continue service delivery under the SAN pool of contracts with AC BH. The CBOs listed in Recommendation A and B, as well as several of the providers in Recommendation C, are non - profit CBOs providing direct service on behalf of the County or governmental organizations that are exempt from the County's S mall, Local and Emerging Business (S LEB) program requirements . However, a number of these non - profit CBOs or governmental organizations have elected to participate in the SLEB program . The SLEB certification number s and expiration dates are included in Attachment A for the CBOs from Recommendation A who elected to become SLEB Certified . The following CBOs from Recommendation B have elected to obtain SLEB Certification: Eden Youth & Family Center (No. 20-00092; Expires: 10/31/2022) and Roots Community Health Center (No. 13-00111, 09/30/2022) . Alameda County General Services Agency -approved SLEB waivers for the following for-profit agencies from Recommendation C, expirin g 6/30/2 3: ART (No. 8207 ), (No. 8205 will work with substance use providers whose SLEB certifications expire before the end of the contract term in maintaining their SLEB status. FINANCING Appropriat ions for these contracts are offset by Medi -Cal, Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, Co-occurring Substance Abuse and Mental Illness Grant, 2011 Realignment, Measure A, County General Funds and State General Funds requested in the ACBH FY 2022 -23 Budget ($ 55,170,196 ) Federal Financial Participation ($1,596,047) and SABG funding ($1,438,277) are requested as a final budget adjustment. The remaining funding will be requested in future years . There is no increase in net County cost as a result of your approval. VISION 2026 GOAL Substance use prevention and treatment services meet the 10 X goal of Healthcare for All in support of the shared vision s of Safe and Livable Communities and a Thriving and Resilient Population .

Under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7501 -7507) and Board policy, the County has the responsibility to determine whether organizations receiving funds throu gh the County have spent them in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, contract terms, and grant agreements. To this en d, effective with the first fiscal year beginning on and after December 26, 2014, the following are required. I. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS A. Funds f rom Federal Sources: 1. Non-Federal entities which are determined to be subrecipients by the supervising department according to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.330 and which expend annual Federal awards in the amount specified in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501 are required to have a single audit p erformed in a ccordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.514. 2. When a non-Federal entity expends annual Federal awards in the amount specified in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(a) under only one Federal program (excluding R&D) and the Federal program's statutes , regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit condu cted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.507 (Program Specific Audits). 3. Non-Federal entities which expend annual Federal awards less than the amount specified in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(d) are exempt from the single audit requirements for that year except that the County may require a limite d-scope audit in a ccordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.503(c). B. Funds f rom All Sour ces: Non-Federal entities which expend annual funds from any source (Federal, State, Count y, etc.) throu gh the County in an amount o f: 1. $100,000 or more must have a financial audit in accordance with the U.S. Comptroller General's Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) covering all County programs. 2. Less than $100,000 are exempt from these audit requirements except as otherwise noted in the contract. Non-Federal entities that are required to have or choose to do a single audit in accordance with 2 CFR Subpart F, Audit Requirements are not required to have a Page 17 of 28financial audit in the same year. However, Non -Federal entities that are required to have a financial audit may also be required to have a limite d-scope audit in the same year. C. General Requirements for All Audits: 1. All audits must be condu cted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (GAGAS). 2. All audits must be conducted annually, except for biennial audits authorized by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.504 and where specifically allowed otherwise by laws, regulations, or County policy. 3. The audit report must contain a separate schedule that identifi es all funds received from or passed throu gh the County that is covered by the audit. County programs must be identifi ed by contract numbe r, contract amoun t, contract period, and amount expended during the fiscal year by funding source. An exhibit numb er must be in cluded when applicable. 4. If a funding source has more stringent and specific audit requirements, these requirements must prevail over those described above. II. AUDIT REPORTS A. For Single Audits 1. Within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report or nine months after the end of the audit period, the auditee must electronically submit to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) the data collection form described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200 .512(b) and the reporting package described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.512(c). The auditee and auditors must ensure that the reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information. The FAC will make the reporting package and the data collec tion form available on a web site and all Federal agencies, pass -through entities and others interested in a reporting package and data collection form must obtain it by accessing the FAC. As required by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.512(a)(2), unless restricted by Federal statutes or regulations, the auditee must make copies available for public inspection. 2. A notice of the audit report issuance along with two copies of the management letter with its corresponding response should be sent to the County supervising departme nt within ten calendar days after it is submitted to the FAC. The County supervising department is responsible for forwarding a copy of the audit report, management letter, and corresponding responses to the County Auditor within one week of receipt. Page 18 of 28B. For Audits other than Single Audits At least two copies of the audit report package, including all attachments and any management letter with its corresponding response, should be sent to the County supervising department within six months after the end of the audit year, or other time frame as specified by the department. The County supervising department is responsible for forwarding a copy of the audit report package to the County Auditor within one week of receipt. III. AUDIT RESOLUTION Within 30 days of issuance of the audit report, the entity must submit to its County supervising d epartment a corrective action plan consistent with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.511(c) to address each audit findin g included in the current year auditor's report. Question ed costs and disallow ed costs must be resolved according to procedures established by the County in the Contr act Administr ation Manual. The County supervising department will follow up on the implem entation of the corrective action plan as it p ertains to County programs. IV. ADDITIONAL AUDIT WORK The Count y, the State, or Federal agencies may condu ct additional audits or reviews to carry out their r egulato ry responsibilities. To the extent possible, these audits and reviews will rely on the audit wo rk already performed und er the audit requirements listed above.

C.Cost Settlement/Final Payment Provisions A Cost Settlement at the end of the term of this agreement between ACBH and Contractor will be considered an interim settlement until all Federal, State, and County audits and appeals have been completed.

Rate of reimbursement may be subject to renegotiation after ACBH review of Contractor's prior fiscal year Year -End Cost Report. Final reimbursement rates shall be determined by Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. See Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimburs ement to identify which of the following method(s) apply to your contract: 1.Actual Cost Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement shall be made on the basis of Contractor's actual allowable costs less any applicable revenues collected from all other paymen t sources up to the Contract Maximum. Page 51 of 822.Negotiated Rate Reimbursement Method Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplying Contractor's negotiated rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3: Method and Rate of Reimbursement (Rate Sheet), by the actual allo wable units of service provided, less any deductible revenues collected by Contractor from all other payers, subject to the maximum program funding amount. 3.Provisional Rate Reimbursement Method Unless otherwise approved in writing by ACBH, ACBH will base Contractor's final reimbursement on actual cost per unit (CPU) of service up to the County Contract Maximum Rate (CCMR), less any applicable revenues collected from all other payers, or Contractor's usual and customary charges during the contract period su bject to the maximum program funding amount. Contractors final reimbursement is subject to the maximum allowable CPU of service limitations established and subject to revision by the State of California. Should Contractor's actual CPU unit of service e xceed the State's maximum allowable CPU of service, Contractor's reimbursable cost will be reduced to the limits mandated by the State. Should Contractor's actual CPU of service exceed the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap, Contractor's reimbursable cost will b e reduced to the CCMR or other ACBH rate cap times allowable units of service. 4.Fee for Service Final reimbursement shall be determined by multiplying the fee -for-service rate(s), specified in Exhibit B -3 by the actual units of service provided, subject to maximum program funding amount. Any share of cost or revenues collected from all other payers shall be deducted from the net reimbursable cost. Final reimbursement rates shall be determined by Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. Fee-for-service rate(s) may be subject to renegotiation after ACBH's review of Contractor's Year -End Cost Report. For Programs Funded Entirely by Drug Medi -Cal (Opioid Treatment Programs). ACBH will base final reimbursement on actual allowable units of service multiplied by the fee for service rate specified in Exhibit B -3. 5.Final Reimbursement Final reimbursement is made after County's submission of an acceptable Year -End Cost Report to the State. The term \"acceptable\" shall be understood as a Year -End Cost Report that has bee n accepted by the State. Should Contractor's final maximum allowable reimbursement be less than the total interim payments made pursuant to submitted invoices, Contractor agrees to remit said difference to County within 60 calendar days of Contractor's rec eipt of Final Contract Settlement, unless otherwise approved by ACBH.
