{"title": "Healing", "author": null, "url": "https://www.fht.org.uk/therapies/healing", "hostname": "fht.org.uk", "description": "Healing is based upon the principle that the physical body is surrounded by an energy field and when a person becomes unwell physically, emotionally or mentally, the energy field can become unbalanced. Sensitive to energy flow and areas of imbalance, a healer channels energy to help to facilitate the rebalancing of the energy field, which in turn, may help to relieve any physical, mental or emotional symptoms. What to expect Although each session varies according to the client's individual needs, typically you will remain fully clothed and either be sitting or lying down throughout the session. The healer will lightly place their hands on - or just above - different areas of your body, often in sequence but occasionally focusing on areas of imbalance. Although everyone experiences different responses, you may feel the energy moving within your body, a twitching or movement as the energy rebalances, or a change in temperature, and feel heat from your therapist's hands. Benefits of healing Healing can provide an energising and balancing effect on the body and mind, induce relaxation, provide support and help you to achieve a sense of well-being. As emotions can impact on physical health, healing can help to relieve tension and create a peaceful environment that stimulates the body's innate ability to self-heal. Healing can complement conventional medicine, offering a supportive tool for people undergoing conventional medical care, by helping to relieve stress and anxiety, enhance coping, ease pain and discomfort, and alleviate side effects. It is often used in hospitals, hospices and other healthcare settings to support patients having orthodox treatment or receiving end of life care.
