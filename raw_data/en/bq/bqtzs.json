This survey looked at the use of these products and practices in patients attending pediatric cardiology clinics in two Canadian children's hospitals. Of the 176 respondents, almost 60% reported use of complementary and alternative medicine at any time in the child's life. The most common products in use were multi - vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, unspecified cold remedies and fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids. Use of alternative prac - tices was also common (Table). Although almost 45% used these products and practices concurrently with conven - tional medicine, about one-third of these respondents did not disclose this concurrent use to their physician; two- thirds did not inform their pharmacist.

DOI 10.1503/cmaj.141296Highlights Use of Z-drugs rising in Manitoba Concerns have been raised about the long-term use of benzo - diazepines, especially in older people. Although it has been suggested that Z-drugs, a newer class of hypnotic medication, have lower potential for abuse and dependence, concerns remain about their effects on human performance and driving. In this population-based study, researchers looked at the incidence and prevalence of benzodiazepine and Z-drug (zopli - cone and zaleplone) use in Manitoba over a 16-year period, 1996-2012. (Zolpidem was not available on the Canadian mar - ket until end of 2011.) Over the study period, the authors found that benzodiazepines were prescribed less frequently to patients 65 yr (55.5 to 30.3 users per 1000). Use remained stable among the rest of the adult population (18-64 yr). Zopiclone prescribing, however, continued to rise in all age groups studied (7.3 to 20.3 users per 1000) (Figure). Highest rates of use were seen among older women and the low-income population. It is unclear whether the observed drop in benzodiazepine use in older people is limited to the diagnosis of insomnia or whether other medications have replaced benzodiazepines for conditions such as anxiety. Despite recommendations to restrict the use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs for insomnia to a maximum of four weeks, patients of all ages seem to stay on these drugs for extended periods, say the authors.
