There are two different ways to show your Covid-19 vaccination status. The first is with the paper confirmation you received at the vaccination centre (Tatler tip: if you're planning to use this, we recommend you get it laminated so that it stays in good shape). More digital-first options are the government's iAM Smart mobile app or the Leave Home Safe app. To add your vaccination record to either, simply scan your paper vaccination record's QR code when you have the app open. Your vaccination details will then be stored within the app. Philanthropic Vaccination Schemes New World Development Company [Asia's Most Influential](https://hk.asiatatler.com/society/asia-most-influential-impact-list-2020) honoree [Adrian Cheng](https://hk.asiatatler.com/people/adrian-cheng)'s New World Development Company has announced a subsidy programme to help the city's most in-need citizens to get vaccinated.
