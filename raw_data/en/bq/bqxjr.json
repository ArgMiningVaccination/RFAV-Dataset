This awakening and awareness brings with it a great reverence for all of life. Steiner termed this process \"Anthropo-sophia\" or \"wisdom of man.\" He once said that Anthroposophy could be understood as \"awareness of one's humanity.\" The insights and observations offered by Anthroposophy have proved a fertile ground for the outgrowth of new endeavours in a wide range of fields. Waldorf education, bio-dynamic gardening and farming, Camphill communities, work with curative education and community living, and Anthroposophic medicine and pharmacies, such as Weleda, are a few of the ways in which this knowledge has been applied. Although Anthroposophy is not taught in Waldorf schools, its vision of the unfolding human being inspires all of Waldorf education.

It arises in man as a need of the heart, of the life of feeling, and it can be justified only inasmuch as it can satisfy this inner need.\"Rudolf Steiner, Founder of Waldorf Education "}
