Walking in to her home-turned-spa is like taking a sigh of relief and hearing her smooth, soothing voice is enough to put any customer at ease. Trattner is calming, but not too much so that one can't take her seriously. She believes in the power of gemstones, but her interest comes from a love of science and a need to have research to backup all of her claims. In fact, Trattner's entire crisp, white home is covered in gemstones, each with a different chakra, or energy. She has loved gemstones since she was a young child. \"I was one of those crazy kids at my grandmother's house\u2014I would go in and just pile everything on my body,\" she says. \"My grandmother had this beautiful jewelry collection. I was fascinated.\" She may not have lived out her dream of going to jewelry school, but over the course of her career, she has managed to marry her love of medicine and gemstones together. For the past 25 years, Trattner has been practicing Chinese and integrative medicine and acupuncture. Through gemstone facials, Trattner has allowed women to find new ways to remain healthy and beautiful inside and out. She specializes in women's health, weight management, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and environmental illnesses. Just by having one conversation with her, her passion for women's health is clear. She is in on all of the latest trends from matcha tea to crystal therapy. From menstrual cycles to weight loss to herbs and crystals, Trattner has the insight on how to make all women feel their best. But no matter what she is treating her clients for, she wants them to feel comfortable, which is perhaps why her home has become her spa workspace. Trattner studied integrative medicine, a use of both conventional and alternative methods facilitates the body's innate healing response, for 10 years. She was mentored by Andrew Weil, the Harvard graduate who founded integrative medicine and University of Arizona's School of Integrative Medicine, where Trattner studied after graduating from Ohio State University. \"For me it's never been alternative, it's always been integrative,\" she says. \"Everything I do has to be based in science. That's how I was trained.\" She is a contributing author for medical publications and websites on Integrative and Chinese Medicine including \"Cosmetic Dermatology: Principles and Practice,\" the first book written by Dr. Leslie Baumann, director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami. So why choose a life as a healer with all of these medical successes under her belt? Trattner saw the power of integrative medicine as she battled her own illness. She was diagnosed with a rare life-threatening autoimmune disorder and severe asthma. She flatlined twice, and her survival gave her insight on the best ways to heal oneself. As a member of the Global Wellness' Beauty Meets Wellness Initiative Committee, Trattner is helping to redefine beauty standards for all women. Through her work in this committee, Trattner teaches women how to use traditions of the past to thrive in a modern world. \"It's amazing to see my love of this for 40 years kind of coming into its own,\" she says. \"This isn't something I just picked up, this has been a love of mine.\" This story comes from our [November 2018 issue](https://bocamag.com/november-2018) of Boca magazine.
