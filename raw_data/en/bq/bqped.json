This includes washing your hands often, coughing and sneezing into your elbow, and cleaning surfaces. Wash your hands Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. Then dry your hands completely. Use hand sanitizer when you can't use soap and water. It's important to wash your hands: - after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing - after visiting a public place or touching surfaces outside of your home - before and after preparing or eating food - after handling waste, touching dirty laundry or using the bathroom - when your hands look dirty or feel dirty If soap and water are not available, and your hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Use enough to cover the fronts and backs of both hands and between all your fingers. Rub your hands together until they feel dry. Cough and sneeze etiquette Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Throw the used tissue in the garbage and wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer immediately. If you don't have a tissue, cough and sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you need to touch your face, wash your hands first. Washing your hands will help keep the virus off your hands so you don't spread it to other people. Clean and disinfect regularly Viruses can live on surfaces for several days. You can reduce the number of germs and reduce your risk of infection by cleaning and disinfecting every day. You should clean the surfaces and objects you touch most frequently at least once a day, or more if needed. Clean and disinfect things like doorknobs, light switches, railings, toilets and tabletops every day. Wash with soapy water first. Then disinfect with household cleaning products, following the directions on the label. If household cleaning products are not available, you can make a diluted bleach solution following the instructions on the bleach label. Or you can make a solution with 5 mL of bleach per 250 mL of water, or 20 mL per litre. You need to mix a fresh batch of the bleach mixture every day for it to work properly. Disinfect phones, remote controls, computers and other handheld devices with 70% alcohol or wipes. Keep your workplace safe Employers and employees need to work together to maintain a healthy workplace. Occupational health and safety practices (like plexiglass dividers and increased cleaning) help prevent COVID-19 and lessen the risk of many respiratory and other illnesses. You should also watch for [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.nshealth.ca/protecting-myself-and-others) and stay home if you feel sick. "}
