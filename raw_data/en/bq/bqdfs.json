Attitudes towards vaccination: users of complementary and alternative medicine versus non-users. Swiss Medical Weekly, 139(13-14):212.Lettertothe Editor 212 Attitudes towards vaccination: users of complementary and alternative medicine versus non-users MarkusGn\u00e4dinger ,MarkusGassner, GaudenzBachmann Weare grateful to the authors [1] for help- ing elucidate the backgrounds of Swiss people who do not comply with the national vaccination plan.As mentioned by the authors in the discus- sion section,only 13% of the participants openly admitted to not having complied with official vaccination recommendations.This constitutes a discrepancy as 30% (toddlers, MMR) or 39% (adolescents, hepatitis B) have been observed as missing vaccinations in a federal vaccination cov- erage study checking individual documents [1]. Thus it seems possible that the target group of the study done by Zuzak et al. may represent only approximately half of those who actually fail to have a complete vaccination history: i.e.,those who do so willingly as believers in anthropo- sophic medicine or homeopathy .The study, however ,does not depict the other 50% who do not comply with vaccination recommendations. The reasons for this mismatch could be various: pre-selection of cases by directly contacting the university hospital, language problems, accessi- bility of medical services, or simply negligence (factors which possibly also reduced the rate of filling in the survey form!). By the way ,we were amazedtoseethatofthe1007surveyformsfilled in, only 170 children had a known country of birth, while in another publication on the same study population [2] this item accounted for 1039 valid answers! In order to deal with negligence or any so- cial problems that may negatively influence vac-cination coverage, St. Gallen, like other cantons inSwitzerland,hasimplementedaschoolscreen- ing and vaccination programme. Every child is examined and vaccinated (if this is not explicitly refused by the parents) a total of three times dur- ing the basic school years: in kindergarten, the fifth and the eighth grade. This kind of school medical service has often been criticized by Swiss paediatricians as outdated and ineffective. How- ever when the individual documents of children are checked by the school medical service one can frequently find outdated reminders for par- ents who did not go to the next routine appoint- ment with their paediatrician.Therefore we con- sider school-based medical services as an appro- priate measure to reach a higher level of compli- ance with vaccination recommendations. This has been shown in a comparative study of can- tons with school-based vs. private practice-based vaccination systems: the coverage against hepati- tis B was 72% as compared to 53% [3]. It is important to realize that school-based medical services contribute to better vaccination coverage and thus prevention of outbreaks. The recent experience of a major measles outbreak in Switzerland has shown the necessity to improve not only individual protection but also to contain the spreading of measles both within as well as outside our country. 1Zuzak TJ ,Zuzak-Siegrist I, Rist L, Staubli G, Simoes-W\u00fcst AP .Attitudes towards vaccination: users of complementary and alternative medicine versus non-users.

Authors reply Weappreciate the accurate reading of our studies by M. Gn\u00e4dinger et al. and thank them for identifying the wrong counts of country of birth of children in table 1. Correct data are as following: Country of birth - Child: All respon- dents: Switzerland (92%), Europe 114 (94%), Europe 4 (3%), other 3 (3%); received all basic vaccinations: Switzerland 761 "}
