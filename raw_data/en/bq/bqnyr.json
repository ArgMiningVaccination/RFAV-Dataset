Dr. David Johnson Director of the Institute for Sustainable Agricultural Research Webinar: \"Soil Biodiversity: Currency of Survival\" A molecular biologist and brilliant soil scientist, [David Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-johnson-95171542/) is the Director of Institute for Sustainable Agricultural Research at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. More about David He also works with Arizona State University, Texas A&M, USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, and directly with growers \u2014 exploring paths to improve food security, reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and increase productivity and profitability through the development of beneficial soil microbial communities in farm and rangeland soils. David co-created the [Johnson-Su Bioreactor](https://www.csuchico.edu/regenerativeagriculture/bioreactor/index.shtml) that creates fungal-dominated compost for carbon sequestration and improved soil health and crop yields, using a method called BEAM \u2014 Biologically Enhanced Agricultural Management. With this method, soil can recover quickly, leading to dramatically improved crop yields and carbon sequestration. David is part of the [Center for Regenerative Agriculture & Resilient Systems](https://www.csuchico.edu/regenerativeagriculture/)at California State University, Chico. Dr. Tim LaSalle Global champion of regenerative agriculture Webinar: \"Regenerative Agriculture: The Source, Course, and Goal\" About Tim Tim grew up on a dairy farm and worked his way through college and a master's degree milking his cows.

Allan Savory One of the founders of the Savory Institute and developer of the Holistic Management framework to address the cause of global desertification, mega-fires and climate change. Webinar: \"Addressing the Root Cause of Climate Change\" About Allan Born in Zimbabwe, Allan has been an independent scientist working on the cause of global desertification and climate change for many decades. In the 1960s he made a significant breakthrough in understanding what was causing the degradation and desertification of the world's grassland ecosystems and, as a resource management consultant, worked with numerous farmers, ranchers, fellow scientists on four continents to develop the Holistic Management framework to manage complexity. He is the cofounder and president of the [Savory Institute for Holistic Management](https://savory.global). He is the author (with his wife, Jody Butterfield) of [Holistic Management: A New Framework for Decision Making](https://www.amazon.com/Holistic-Management-Framework-Decision-Making/dp/155963488X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1399854843&sr=8-3&keywords=allan+savory), which describes his work to address the universal management and policy development of today that is the cause of desertification and climate change. Long blamed on livestock and fossil fuels, almost all scientists are today agreed that humans are causing climate change. This has only one possible interpretation as Savory points out - management is the cause of climate change. His [2013 TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI) was voted one of the 50 most intriguing TED talks of all time. In 2003, Allan received Australia's International Banksia Award \"for the person or organization doing the most for the environment on a global scale.\" In 2010, Savory and the Africa Centre received the Buckminster Fuller Institute's Challenge award for work that has \"significant potential to solve humanity's most pressing problems.\" Dr. Rattan Lal Pioneering agricultural scientist Webinar: \"Nourish the Soil, Save the World\" About Rattan Lal Dr. Lal has transformed the way the world looks at soil \u2014 and has shown how, in a single stroke, we can address the climate crisis and other major global challenges. Dr. Lal began his life as a refugee growing up on a small subsistence farm in India, where he watched his family use oxen to plow hard soils in an environment of soaring heat. From there he rose to become one of the world's most celebrated scientists. In 1997, Dr. Lal co-authored the first documented scientific report showing how restoring degraded soil could also safeguard against rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. His many subsequent studies demonstrated that by creating healthy soil we can safeguard the planet against carbon emissions as well as address the challenges of food security, water quality, and pollution. In other words, with healthy soil, we can create healthier food, healthier people, and a healthier planet. As part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Last June Dr. Lal was honored with the World Food Prize, known as the \"Nobel Prize for Food and Agriculture.\" He has received eight honorary doctoral degrees and nearly fifty other distinguished awards and prizes. The agricultural practices Dr. Lal has championed \u2014 no-tillage farming, cover crops, agroforestry \u2014 today are among the leading strategies for improving agricultural systems around the world. Dr. Lal is Distinguished University Professor of Soil Science and the director of the recently-renamed Rattan Lal Carbon Management and Sequestration Center at Ohio State University. "}
