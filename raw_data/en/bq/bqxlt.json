As part of their osteopathic medical school studies, DOs receive extra training in manipulating the musculoskeletal system\u2014your body's interconnected system of nerves, muscles and bones that make up two-thirds of your body mass. This training in osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) provides osteopathic physicians with a better understanding of how an injury or illness in one part of the body can affect another. The art and science of OMM pertain to the assessment of the impact of the malfunctioning neuromusculoskeletal systems on health and disease, and designing appropriate interventions which often include some form of OMT. There are approximately 15 major types of OMT and more than 1,000 individual techniques. OMM is incorporated into the training of all osteopathic physicians. With OMM, DOs use their hands to diagnose injury and illness and to encourage your body's natural tendency toward good health. By combining all other medical procedures with OMM, DOs offer their patients the most comprehensive care available in medicine today. "}
