Crestor Dosage and Administration 2.1 General Dosage and Administration Information - - Administer CRESTOR orally as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food. The tablet should be swallowed whole. - - Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 weeks after initiating CRESTOR, and adjust the dosage if necessary. - - If a dose is missed, advise patients not take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose. 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients - - The dosage range for CRESTOR is 5 to 40 mg orally once daily. - - The recommended dose of CRESTOR depends on a patient's indication for usage, LDL-C, and individual risk for cardiovascular events. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients Dosage in Pediatric Patients 8 Years of Age and Older with HeFH The recommended dosage range is 5 mg to 10 mg orally once daily in patients aged 8 years to less than 10 years and 5 mg to 20 mg orally once daily in patients aged 10 years and older. Dosage in Pediatric Patients 7 Years of Age and Older with HoFH The recommended dosage is 20 mg orally once daily. 2.4 Dosing in Asian Patients Initiate CRESTOR at 5 mg once daily due to increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations. Consider the risks and benefits of CRESTOR when treating Asian patients not adequately controlled at doses up to 20 mg once daily [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#ID_149e50ef-0d0b-4f40-b1c3-d8b38843366a), [Use in Specific Populations (8.8)](#ID_8f018e35-3ee2-4090-a9c6-997d4f8c76a6), and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#ID_c0ada22f-7299-4bd7-a1d9-1134fd2612ff)]. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) not on hemodialysis, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg once daily and should not exceed 10 mg once daily [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#ID_149e50ef-0d0b-4f40-b1c3-d8b38843366a) and [Use in Specific Populations (8.6)](#ID_a3054989-2947-4434-9202-7cac8b00d71f)]. There are no dosage adjustment recommendations for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. 2.6 Dosage and Administration Modifications Due to Drug Interactions CRESTOR Dosage Modifications Due to Drug Interactions Table 1 displays dosage modifications for CRESTOR due to drug interactions [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#ID_149e50ef-0d0b-4f40-b1c3-d8b38843366a) and [Drug Interactions (7.1)](#ID_b68001d0-9698-48d8-a06d-15a265894e79)]. | | Concomitantly Used Drug | | CRESTOR Dosage Modifications | | Cyclosporine | | Do not exceed 5 mg once daily. | | Teriflunomide | | Do not exceed 10 mg once daily. | | Enasidenib | | Do not exceed 10 mg once daily. | | Capmatinib | | Do not exceed 10 mg once daily. | | Fostamatinib | | Do not exceed 20 mg once daily. | | Febuxostat | | Do not exceed 20 mg once daily. | | Gemfibrozil | | Avoid concomitant use.

Debossed \"ZD4522\" on one side and \"40\" on the other side of the tablet. 4. Contraindications CRESTOR is contraindicated in the following conditions: - - Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#ID_2d070474-0c2b-41ba-a0a0-2d01988bdddf)]. excipients Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, reported with CRESTOR [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#ID_f810a7d4-640d-42d8-9be5-bad9a6420a0b)]. 5. Warnings and and Rhabdomyolysis CRESTOR may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including CRESTOR. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher CRESTOR dosage. Asian patients on CRESTOR may be at higher risk for myopathy [see [Drug Interactions (7.1)](#ID_b68001d0-9698-48d8-a06d-15a265894e79) and [Use in Specific Populations (8.8)](#ID_8f018e35-3ee2-4090-a9c6-997d4f8c76a6)]. The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg daily compared with lower CRESTOR dosages. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of CRESTOR with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. CRESTOR dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see [Dosage and Administration (2.6)](#ID_f954dfd4-4729-4787-ba58-79814a4fa6a8)]. Niacin, and rhabdomyolysis [see [Drug Interactions (7.1)](#ID_b68001d0-9698-48d8-a06d-15a265894e79)]. Discontinue CRESTOR if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if CRESTOR is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue CRESTOR in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the CRESTOR dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist discontinuation reductase with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue CRESTOR if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of CRESTOR [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#ID_f810a7d4-640d-42d8-9be5-bad9a6420a0b)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking CRESTOR versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with CRESTOR. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including CRESTOR. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.7)](#ID_6f2a4150-06d9-4238-8e34-0870057073e7)]. Consider liver enzyme testing before CRESTOR initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see [Contraindications (4)](#ID_07d6d429-7e43-49f5-b63b-60ffc7e72566)]. If serious hepatic injury with symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue CRESTOR. 5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the CRESTOR clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among CRESTOR treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of CRESTOR or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on CRESTOR therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing. 5.5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including CRESTOR. Based on clinical trial data with CRESTOR, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#ID_f810a7d4-640d-42d8-9be5-bad9a6420a0b)]. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices. 6. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Myopathy Serum Glucose Levels [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.5)](#ID_d2f4af30-908e-4f9f-9477-fcc323906901)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2. These studies had a treatment duration of up to 12 weeks. | | Adverse Reactions | | Placebo N=382 % | | CRESTOR 5 mg N=291 % | | CRESTOR 10 mg N=283 % | | CRESTOR 20 mg N=64 % | | CRESTOR 40 mg N=106 % | | Total CRESTOR 5 mg40 mg N=744 % | | Headache | | 5.0 | | 5.5 | | 4.9 | | 3.1 | | 8.5 | | 5.5 | | Nausea | | 3.1 | | 3.8 | | 3.5 | | 6.3 | | 0 | | 3.4 | | Myalgia | | 1.3 | | 3.1 | | 2.1 | | 6.3 | | 1.9 | | 2.8 | | Asthenia | | 2.6 | | 2.4 | | 3.2 | | 4.7 | | 0.9 | | 2.7 | | Constipation | | 2.4 | | 2.1 | | 2.1 | | 4.7 | | 2.8 | | 2.4 Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies were abdominal pain, dizziness, hypersensitivity (including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema) and pancreatitis. The following laboratory abnormalities have also been dipstick-positive thyroid function abnormalities. In the METEOR study, patients were treated with CRESTOR 40 mg (n=700) or placebo (n=281) with a mean treatment duration of 1.7 years. Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 3. |Adverse Reactions||Placebo | N=281 % |CRESTOR 40 mg | N=700 % | | | | Myalgia | | 12.1 | | 12.7 | | Arthralgia | | 7.1 | | 10.1 | | Headache | | 5.3 | | 6.4 | | Dizziness | | 2.8 | | 4.0 | | Increased CPK | | 0.7 | | 2.6 | | Abdominal pain | | 1.8 | | 2.4 | | ALT greater than 3x ULN | | 0.7 | | 2.2 In the JUPITER study, patients were treated with CRESTOR 20 mg (n=8901) or placebo (n=8901) for a mean duration of 2 years. In JUPITER, there was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking CRESTOR (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in CRESTOR-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in CRESTOR-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#ID_87f36f0e-09d0-4356-8575-7cd6a0114a6a)]. Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 4. | | Adverse Reactions | | Placebo N=8901 % | | CRESTOR 20 mg N=8901 % | | Myalgia | | 6.6 | | 7.6 | | Arthralgia | | 3.2 | | 3.8 | | Constipation | | 3.0 | | 3.3 | | Diabetes mellitus | | 2.3 | | 2.8 | | Nausea | | 2.3 | | 2.4 Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 12week controlled study in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH with CRESTOR 5 to 20 mg daily [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.4)](#ID_c91fae6d-6692-43ae-a53f-011ecc5c7d21) and [Clinical Studies (14)](#ID_87f36f0e-09d0-4356-8575-7cd6a0114a6a)], elevations in serum CK greater than 10 x ULN were observed more frequently in CRESTOR-treated patients compared with patients receiving placebo. Four of 130 (3%) patients treated with CRESTOR (2 treated with 10 mg and 2 treated with 20 mg) had increased CK greater than 10 x ULN, compared to 0 of 46 patients on placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of CRESTOR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood Disorders: thrombocytopenia Hepatobiliary use Nervous System Disorders: peripheral neuropathy, rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, and confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric Disorders: depression, sleep disorders (including insomnia and nightmares) Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: gynecomastia Respiratory Disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), lichenoid drug eruption 7. Drug Interactions 7.1 Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with CRESTOR Rosuvastatin is a substrate of CYP2C9 and transporters (such as OATP1B1, BCRP). Rosuvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP2C9 and transporters. Table 5 includes a list of drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with CRESTOR and instructions for preventing or managing them [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#ID_149e50ef-0d0b-4f40-b1c3-d8b38843366a) and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#ID_c0ada22f-7299-4bd7-a1d9-1134fd2612ff)]. | | Cyclosporine | | Clinical Impact: | | Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure 7-fold.

The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with CRESTOR. | | Intervention: | | Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with CRESTOR outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. | | Niacin | | Clinical Impact: | | Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occurred with concomitant use of lipid-modifying doses (1 g/day) of niacin with CRESTOR. | | Intervention: | | Consider if the benefit of using lipid-modifying doses (1 g/day) of niacin concomitantly with CRESTOR outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. | | Colchicine | | Clinical Impact: | | Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with CRESTOR. | | Intervention: | | Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with CRESTOR outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. 7.2 Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of CRESTOR Table 6 presents drug interactions that may decrease the efficacy of CRESTOR and instructions for preventing or managing them. | | Antacids | | Clinical Impact: | | Concomitant aluminum and magnesium hydroxide combination antacid administration decreased the mean exposure of rosuvastatin 50% [see | | Intervention: | | In patients taking antacid, administer CRESTOR at least 2 hours after the antacid . 7.3 CRESTOR Effects on Other Drugs Table 7 presents CRESTOR's effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them. | | Warfarin | | Clinical Impact: | | Rosuvastatin significantly increased the INR in patients receiving warfarin [see | | Intervention: | | In patients taking warfarin, obtain an INR before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough after initiation, dose titration or discontinuation to ensure that no significant alteration in INR occurs. Once the INR is stable, monitor INR at regularly recommended intervals. 8. Use In Specific Populations 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue CRESTOR when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. CRESTOR decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, CRESTOR may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)](#ID_fd674746-d0e7-4e46-8245-532d76fdb8f0)]. In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with CRESTOR use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered rosuvastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in systemic exposures equivalent to human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day, based on AUC and body surface area (mg/m2), respectively (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders - including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use - using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data In female rats given 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight (female pups) and delayed ossification at 50 mg/kg/day (10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg/day based on AUC). In pregnant rats given 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 (weaning), decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day based body surface area). In pregnant rabbits given 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18, decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on body surface area). Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3% and 20%, respectively, of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg/kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats. In rabbits, fetal tissue distribution was 25% of maternal plasma concentration after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg/kg on gestation day 18. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in published literature indicate that CRESTOR is present in human milk. There is no available information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Statins, including CRESTOR, decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, based on the mechanism of action, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CRESTOR [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.1)](#ID_c80a1e31-4f4c-4332-8d44-f96b9258cb21) and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)](#ID_fd674746-d0e7-4e46-8245-532d76fdb8f0)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of CRESTOR for this indication is based on one 12-week controlled trial with a 40-week open-label extension period in 176 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH and one 2year open-label, uncontrolled trial in 175 pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#ID_87f36f0e-09d0-4356-8575-7cd6a0114a6a)]. In the 1-year trial with a 12-week controlled phase, there was no detectable effect of CRESTOR on growth, weight, BMI (body mass index), or sexual maturation in patients aged 10 to 17 years. The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR as an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with HoFH. Use of CRESTOR for this indication is based on a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 14 pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with HoFH [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#ID_87f36f0e-09d0-4356-8575-7cd6a0114a6a)]. The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 8 years of age with HeFH, younger than 7 years of age with HoFH, or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH or HoFH). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of CRESTOR-treated patients in clinical studies, 3159 (31%) were 65 years and older, and 698 (6.8%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Advanced age (65 years) is a risk factor for CRESTOR-associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving CRESTOR for the increased risk of myopathy [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#ID_149e50ef-0d0b-4f40-b1c3-d8b38843366a)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Rosuvastatin exposure is not influenced by mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Exposure to rosuvastatin is increased to a clinically significant extent in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who are not receiving hemodialysis [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#ID_c0ada22f-7299-4bd7-a1d9-1134fd2612ff)]. Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy. In patients with severe renal impairment not on hemodialysis, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg daily and should not exceed 10 mg daily [see [Dosage and Administration (2.5)](#ID_b5a01c17-299c-44aa-8504-5ec5628ca1f4) and [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#ID_149e50ef-0d0b-4f40-b1c3-d8b38843366a)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. Chronic alcohol liver disease is known to increase rosuvastatin exposure. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Asian Patients Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with White controls. Adjust the CRESTOR dosage in Asian patients [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#ID_3f8a0510-38d1-4e61-9eff-e8bc8324913a) and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#ID_c0ada22f-7299-4bd7-a1d9-1134fd2612ff)]. No specific antidotes for CRESTOR are known. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin. Contact Poison Control (1-800-222-1222) for latest recommendations. 11. Crestor 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl calcium is bis[(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino] pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid] calcium salt with the following structural formula: The empirical formula for rosuvastatin calcium is (C22H27FN3O6S)2Ca and the molecular weight is 1001.14. Rosuvastatin calcium is a white amorphous powder that is sparingly soluble in water and methanol, and slightly soluble in ethanol. Rosuvastatin calcium is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient (octanol/water) of 0.13 at pH of 7.0. CRESTOR tablets for oral use contain rosuvastatin 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg (equivalent to 5.2 mg, 10.4 mg, 20.8 mg, and 41.6 mg rosuvastatin calcium) and yellow ferric oxide. 12. Crestor - Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action CRESTOR is an inhibitor reductase, converts 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl cholesterol. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by rosuvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of CRESTOR is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to CRESTOR dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%. The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration. Effect of food Administration of CRESTOR with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin. Distribution Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations. Elimination Metabolism Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \\ 2C9, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound. Excretion Following oral administration, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%). After an intravenous dose, approximately 28% of total body clearance was via the renal route, and 72% by the hepatic route. The elimination half-life of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age 65 years). Pediatric Patients In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of two pediatric trials involving patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 10 to 17 years of age and 8 to 17 years of age, respectively, rosuvastatin exposure appeared comparable to or lower than rosuvastatin exposure in adult patients. Male and Female Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women. Racial or Ethnic Groups A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian, Hispanic, and Black or Afro-Caribbean groups. However, pharmacokinetic studies, including one conducted in the US, have demonstrated an approximate 2fold elevation in median exposure (AUC and Cmax) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. However, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent (about 3fold) in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy (CLcr >80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Steady-state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50% greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased. In patients with ChildPugh A disease, Cmax and AUC were increased by 60% and 5%, respectively, as compared with patients with normal liver function. In patients with ChildPugh B disease, Cmax and AUC were increased 100% and 21%, respectively, compared with patients with normal liver function. Drug Interactions Studies Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent. Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polyprotein 1B1 (OATP1B1) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Concomitant administration of CRESTOR with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins (e.g. cyclosporine, certain HIV protease inhibitors) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations [see [Dosage and Administration |Dose (mg)| - [*](#footnote-reference-2) - Single dose unless otherwise noted. - [](#footnote-reference-3) - Clinically significant [see [Dosage and Administration (2)](#ID_c0650ff0-6f19-4b9a-be5a-0db2e0d6804a)and [Warnings and Precautions (5)](#ID_8feb70a7-5e35-44a2-bf85-1b10b3e7ebe8)] - Mean ratio with 90% CI (with/without coadministered drug, e.g., 1= no change, 0.7 = 30% decrease, 11=11fold increase in exposure) Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (400 mg-100 mg-100 mg) + Voxilaprevir (100 mg) once daily for 15 days 10 mg, dose 7.39 [](#footnote-3) (6.68-8.18) [](#footnote-4) 18.88 [](#footnote-3) (16.23-21.96) [](#footnote-4) Cyclosporine - stable dose required (75 mg - 200 mg BID) 10 mg, QD for 10 days 7.1 [](#footnote-3) 11 [](#footnote-3) Darolutamide 600 mg BID, 5 days 5 mg, single dose 5.2 [](#footnote-3) ~5 [](#footnote-3) Regorafenib 160 mg QD, 14 days 5 mg, single dose 3.8 [](#footnote-3) 4.6 [](#footnote-3) Atazanavir/ritonavir combination 300 mg/100 mg QD for 8 days 10 mg 3.1 [](#footnote-3) 7 [](#footnote-3) Simeprevir 150 mg QD, 7 days 10 [](#footnote-3) (2.3-3.4) [](#footnote-4) 3.2 [](#footnote-3) (2.6-3.9) [](#footnote-4) Velpatasvir 100 (2.46-2.94) 100 mg + dasabuvir 400 mg BID 5 100 mg QD, 28 days 10 mg, single dose 2.44 3.66 Elbasvir 50 mg/grazoprevir 200 mg once daily 10 mg, 2.26 (1.89-2.69) [](#footnote-4) 5.49 [](#footnote-3) (4.29-7.04) [](#footnote-4) Glecaprevir 400 mg/pibrentasvir BID for 17 days 20 mg, QD for 7 days 2.1 [](#footnote-3) (1.7-2.6) [](#footnote-4) 5 [](#footnote-3) (3.4-6.4) [](#footnote-4) days 1.9 [](#footnote-3) (1.5-2.5) [](#footnote-4) 2.1 [](#footnote-3) (1.8-2.6) [](#footnote-4) Gemfibrozil 600 [](#footnote-3) (1.6-2.2) [](#footnote-4) 2.2 [](#footnote-3) (1.8-2.7) [](#footnote-4) Tafamidis 61 mg BID on Days 1 & 2, followed by QD on Days 3 to 9 10 [](#footnote-4) 2 (1.8-2.3) [](#footnote-4) Darunavir 600 mg/ritonavir 100 mg BID, 7 days 10 mg, QD for 7 days 1.5 (1.0-2.1) [](#footnote-4) 2.4 (1.6-3.6) [](#footnote-4) Tipranavir/ritonavir combination 500 mg/200 mg BID for 11 10 mg 1.4 (1.2-1.6) [](#footnote-4) 2.2 (1.8-2.7) [](#footnote-4) Dronedarone 400 mg BID 10 mg 1.4 Itraconazole 200 mg QD, 5 days 10 mg or 80 mg 1.4 (1.2-1.6) QD, 14 days 10 mg, QD for 14 days - - 1.2 - - (0.9-1.6) [](#footnote-4) 1.2 (0.8-1.6) [](#footnote-4) Fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700 mg/100 mg BID for 7 days 10 mg 1.1 1.5 Fenofibrate 67 mg TID for 7 days 10 mg 1.2 (1.1-1.3) [](#footnote-4) Rifampicin 450 mg QD, 7 days 20 mg Aluminum & magnesium hydroxide combination antacid Administered simultaneously Administered 2 hours apart 40 mg 40 mg 0.5 [](#footnote-3) (0.4-0.5) Ketoconazole BID 80 mg 1.0 (0.8-1.2) [](#footnote-4) 1.0 (0.7-1.3) [](#footnote-4) Fluconazole 200 mg QD (1.0-1.3) [](#footnote-4) 1.1 (0.9-1.4) [](#footnote-4) Erythromycin 500 mg QID (0.7-0.9) [](#footnote-4) 0.7 (0.5-0.9) [](#footnote-4) QD= Once daily, BID= Twice TID= Three QID= Four times daily |Rosuvastatin Dosage Regimen||Coadministered Drug| and Dose||Change in AUC||Change in Cmax| | | | | 40 mg QD for 10 days | | Warfarin 25 mg single dose | | R-Warfarin 1.0 (1.0-1.1) S-Warfarin 1.1 (1.0-1.1) | | R-Warfarin S-Warfarin 1.0 (0.9-1.1) | | 40 mg QD for 12 days | | Digoxin 0.5 mg single dose | | 1.0 (0.9-1.2) | | 1.0 (0.9-1.2) | | 40 mg QD for 28 days | | Oral Contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol mg & norgestrel 0.180, 0.215 and 0.250 for 21 Days | | EE 1.3 (1.2-1.3) NG 1.3 (1.3-1.4) | | EE 1.3 (1.2-1.3) EE = norgestrel, Once daily 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Disposition of rosuvastatin, involves OATP1B1 and other transporter proteins. Higher plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin have been reported in very small groups of patients (n=3 to 5) who have two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1 521T > The frequency of this (i.e., SLCO1B1 521 C/C) is generally lower than 5% in most racial/ethnic groups. The impact of this polymorphism on efficacy and/or safety of CRESTOR has not been clearly established. 13. Nonclinical Toxicology 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2, 20, 60, or 80 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 80 mg/kg/day at systemic exposure 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses. In a 107week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10, 60, or 200 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma was observed at 200 mg/kg/day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses. Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the mouse lymphoma assay, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5, 15, 50 mg/kg/day, males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg/kg/day for one month, spermatidic giant cells were seen. Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6month treatment at 30 mg/kg/day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium. Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on body surface area. Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class. 14. Clinical Studies Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of CRESTOR on the occurrence of major cardiovascular (CV) disease events was assessed in 17,802 men (50 years) and women (60 years) who had no clinically evident cardiovascular disease, LDLC levels <130 mg/dL and hsCRP levels 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDLC levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDLC of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n=8901) or CRESTOR 20 mg once daily (n=8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in CRESTOR-treated subjects. The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial or an arterial revascularization procedure. CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p<0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 1). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDLC, HDLC, and hsCRP levels. Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in JUPITER The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the CRESTOR and placebo groups for death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina. CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in CRESTOR-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in CRESTOR-treated subjects). In a post-hoc subgroup analysis of JUPITER subjects (rosuvastatin=725, placebo=680) with a hsCRP 2 mg/L and no other traditional risk factors (smoking, BP 140/90 or taking antihypertensives, low HDLC) other than age, after adjustment for high HDLC, there was no significant treatment benefit with CRESTOR treatment. Figure 2. Major CV Events by Treatment Group in JUPITER At one year, CRESTOR increased HDLC and reduced LDLC, hsCRP, total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels (p<0.001 for all versus placebo). CRESTOR TotalC, LDLC, ApoB, nonHDLC, and in hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In a multicenter, doubleblind, placebocontrolled study in patients with hyperlipidemia, CRESTOR given as a single daily dose (5 to 40 mg) for 6 weeks significantly reduced TotalC, LDLC, nonHDLC, and ApoB, across the dose range (Table 10). |Dose||N||TotalC||LDLC||Non-HDLC||ApoB||TG||HDLC| | | Placebo | | 13 | | -5 | | -7 | | -7 | | -3 | | -3 | | 3 | | CRESTOR 5 mg | | 17 | | -33 | | -45 | | -44 | | -38 | | -35 | | 13 | | CRESTOR 10 mg | | 17 | | -36 | | -52 | | -48 | | -42 | | -10 | | 14 | | CRESTOR 20 mg | | 17 | | -40 | | -55 | | -51 | | -46 | | -23 | | 8 | | CRESTOR 40 mg | | 18 | | -46 | | -63 | | -60 | | -54 | | -28 | | 10 CRESTOR was compared with the simvastatin, patients with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. After randomization, patients were treated for 6 weeks with a single daily dose of either CRESTOR, atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin (Figure 3 and Table 11). Figure 3.

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study 984 adult patients were randomized (of whom 876 were analyzed) in a 5:2 ratio to CRESTOR 40 mg or placebo once daily. Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the annualized rate of change per patient from baseline to two years in mean maximum cIMT of 12 measured segments. The estimated difference in the rate of change in the maximum cIMT analyzed over all 12 carotid artery sites between patients treated with CRESTOR and was -0.0145 mm/year (95% CI -0.0196, -0.0093; p<0.0001). The annualized rate of change from baseline for the placebo group was +0.0131 mm/year (p<0.0001). The annualized rate of change from baseline for the group treated with CRESTOR was -0.0014 mm/year (p=0.32). At an individual patient level in the group treated with CRESTOR, 52.1% of patients demonstrated an absence of disease progression (defined as a negative annualized rate of change), compared to 37.7% of patients in the placebo group. HeFH in Adults In a study of adult patients with HeFH (baseline mean LDL of 291 mg/dL), patients were randomized to CRESTOR 20 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg. The dose was increased at 6-week intervals. Significant LDL-C reductions from baseline were seen at each dose in both treatment groups (Table 12). |CRESTOR (n=435) | LS Mean |Atorvastatin (n=187) | LS Mean1 (95% CI) | | | | Week 6 | | 20 mg | | -47% (-49%, -46%) | | -38% (-40%, -36%) | | Week 12 | | 40 mg | | -55% (-57%, -54%) | | -47% (-49%, -45%) | | Week 18 | | 80 mg | | NA | | -52% (-54%, -50%) HeFH multicenter, placebo-controlled, 12-week study, 176 (97 male and 79 female) children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg or placebo daily. Patients ranged in age from 10 to 17 years (median age of 14 years) with approximately 30% of the patients 10 to 13 years and approximately 17%, 18%, 40%, and 25% at Tanner stages II, III, IV, and V, respectively. Females were at least 1 year postmenarche. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 233 mg/dL (range of 129 to 399). The 12week double-blind phase was followed by a 40 week open label dose-titration phase, where all patients (n=173) received 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg rosuvastatin daily. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced LDL-C (primary end point), total cholesterol and ApoB levels at each dose compared to placebo. Results are shown in Table 13 below. |Dose (mg)||N||LDLC||HDLC||TotalC||TG| Placebo two-year openlabel, uncontrolled, titration-to-goal trial that included 175 children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who were 8 to 17 years old (79 boys and 96 girls). All patients had a documented genetic defect in the LDL receptor or in ApoB. Approximately 89% were White, 7% were Asian, 1% were Black, and fewer than 1% were Hispanic. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 236 mg/dL. Fifty-eight (33%) patients were prepubertal at baseline. The starting rosuvastatin dosage for all children and adolescents was 5 mg once daily. Children 8 to less than 10 years of age (n=41 at baseline) could titrate to a maximum dosage of 10 mg once daily, and children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age could titrate to a maximum dosage of 20 mg once daily. The reductions in LDLC from baseline were generally consistent across age groups within the trial as well as with previous experience in both adult and pediatric controlled trials. HoFH in Adult and Pediatric Patients In an open-label, forced-titration study, HoFH patients (n=40, 863 years) were evaluated for their response to CRESTOR 20 to 40 mg titrated at a 6week interval. In the overall population, the mean LDLC reduction from baseline was 22%. About one-third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDLC lowering of greater than 6%. In the 27 patients with at least a 15% reduction in LDLC, the mean LDLC reduction was 30% (median 28% reduction). Among 13 patients with an LDLC reduction of <15%, 3 had no change or an increase in LDLC. Reductions in LDLC of 15% or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status. HoFH in Pediatric Patients CRESTOR was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, cross-over study in 14 pediatric patients with HoFH. The study included a 4week dietary leadin phase during which patients received CRESTOR 10 mg daily, a crossover phase that included two 6week treatment periods with either CRESTOR 20 mg or placebo in random order, followed by a 12week openlabel phase during which all patients received CRESTOR 20 mg. Patients ranged in age from 7 to 15 years of age (median 11 years), 50% were male, 71% were White, 21% were Asian, 7% were Black, and no patients were of Hispanic ethnicity. Fifty percent were on apheresis therapy and 57% were taking ezetimibe. Patients who entered the study on apheresis therapy or ezetimibe continued the treatment throughout the entire study. Mean LDLC at baseline was 416 mg/dL (range 152 to 716 mg/dL). A total of 13 patients completed both treatment periods of the randomized cross-over phase; one patient withdrew consent due to inability to have blood drawn during the cross-over phase. CRESTOR 20 mg significantly reduced LDL-C, total cholesterol, ApoB, and non-HDL-C compared to placebo (Table 14). | | Placebo (N=13) | | CRESTOR 20 mg (N=13) | | Percent difference (95% CI) | | LDL-C (mg/dL) | | 481 | | 396 | | (-33.5, -9.1) | | Total-C (mg/dL) (-29.7, -9.1) | | Non-HDL-C (mg/dL) | | 505 | | 412 | | -22.9% (-33.7, 10.3) | | ApoB (mg/dL) | | 268 | | 235 | | -17.1% (-29.2, -2.9) | | % Difference estimates are based on transformations of the estimated mean difference in log LDL measurements between CRESTOR and placebo using a mixed model adjusted for study period. Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia in Adults In a randomized, multicenter, double-blind crossover study, 32 adult patients (27 with 2/2 and 4 with apo E mutation [Arg145Cys] with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia entered a 6week dietary lead-in period on the NCEP Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC) diet. Following dietary lead-in, patients were randomized to a sequence of treatments for 6 weeks each: rosuvastatin 10 mg followed by rosuvastatin 20 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg followed by rosuvastatin 10 mg. CRESTOR reduced non-HDLC (primary end point) and circulating remnant lipoprotein levels. Results are shown in the table below. |Median at Baseline (mg/dL)||Median percent change from baseline (95% CI) | CRESTOR 10 mg |Median percent change from baseline (95% CI) | CRESTOR 20 mg | | TotalC | | 342.5 | | -43.3 (-46.9, - 37.5) | | -47.6 (-51.6,-42.8) | | Triglycerides | | 503.5 -33.6) | -57.3 (-59.4, -52.1) | | HDLC | | 35.5 | | 10.2 (1.9, 12.3) | | 11.2 (8.3, 20.5) | | RLPC | | 82.0 | | -56.4 -64.9 (-74.0, -33.3) | In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult patients with baseline TG levels from 273 to 817 mg/dL, CRESTOR given as a single daily dose (5 to 40 mg) over 6 weeks significantly reduced serum TG levels (Table 16). |Dose||Placebo | (n=26) |CRESTOR mg (n=25) |CRESTOR mg (n=23) |CRESTOR | 20 mg (n=27) |CRESTOR | 40 mg (n=25) | | Triglycerides | | 1 (-40, 72) | | -21 (-58, 38) | | -37 (-65, 5) | | -37 (-72, 11) | | -43 (-80, -7) | | Non-HDL-C | | 2 (-13, 19) | | -29 (-43, -8) | | -49 (-59, -20) 12) | | -51 (-62, -6) | | Total-C | | 1 (-13, 17) | | -24 (-40, -4) | | -40 (-51, -14) | | -34 (-61, -11) | | -40 (-51, -4) | | LDL-C | | 5 (-30, 52) | | -28 (-71, 2) | | -45 (-59, 7) | | -31 (-66, 34) | | -43 (-61, -3) | | HDL-C | | -3 (-25, 18) | | 3 (-38, 33) | | 8 (-8, 24) | | 22 (-5, 50) | | 17 (-14, 63) 16.
