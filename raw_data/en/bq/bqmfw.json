These delivery devices have included microbial cells engineered to trigger a strong and directed immune response. This project is linked to a theme within our group focused upon vaccine delivery and design. Long-term goals include effective and cost-effective vaccine production for broad distribution. In this work, we have designed a hybrid delivery vector composed of two components: a cationic polymer (termed a poly (beta-amino ester)) and an E. coli cell (capable of packaging diverse antigen content). The project cross-sects materials, biotech, medicine, and engineering. "}
