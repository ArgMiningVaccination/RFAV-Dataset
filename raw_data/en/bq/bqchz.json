Factors such as metabolism, meal timing and fasting, carbohydrate and fat consumption, ketosis, mitochondrial energy production and wasting, autophagy, and others will be discussed. By way of introducing the topic, it must be stated that my orientation is that of the medical system as it is practiced in the U.S.A. where a genuine healthcare system hardly exists. The large majority of allopathic M.D.s. do not practice \"healthcare\". Instead, they are part of a very large and elaborate disease management and maintenance system run primarily by huge, for-profit corporations. Their protocols and methodologies are specifically designed to rake in maximum profits, frequently to the detriment of patients. For instance, whistleblowers from within the specialty of Oncology allege that oftentimes a chemotherapeutic regimen is selected for a cancer patient based on the drug's patent status and its high price rather than on what might be most beneficial for the patient, particularly if the choice is between a very cheap off-patent drug and the latest offering with a price tag of perhaps more than $200,000 for the course of treatment. If this sounds like a major conflict of interest that shouldn't be allowed, that would be correct, but nevertheless it is common practice. And what transpired inside of many U.S. hospitals during COVID made these egregious behaviors in the cancer specialty seem almost saintly by comparason. How did we get to this state of affairs? By letting Big Money take over our medical system, and it all started with John D. Rockefeller and his Standard Oil money in the early twentieth century. Between bribes and coercion he took control of the medical schools and ended up putting the non-cooperative ones out of business. The schools' curricula became focused on a new model of medicine: don't cure people; only treat symptoms to suppress them so that the patient never gets well and becomes a life-long consumer of toxic petroleum-based pharmaceutical drugs, the newest industrial specialty that the oil companies were expanding into. To further support this business model, Rockerfeller used his enormous wealth to influence medical journals and medical associations to promote only his pharmaceutical drug use and suppress all competing modalities of healing: Osteopathic, Homeopathy, Naturopathic, Herbal, Nutritional, etc. Because of this philosophy of treating everything with symptom-suppressing drugs, many health conditions became fixed in the public's mind as chronic and incurable. Type 2 diabetes, for instance IS completely preventable and fairly easy to put into remission and even cure with the right dietary regimen. And yet even today many doctors are not aware of this fact, and certainly not their patients, who often remain in poor health for years. T2DM is not actually even a \"disease\"! It is the body's natural and normal response to a very abnormal diet and lifestyle. Lifestyle health issues cannot be fixed with pharmaceutical drugs! Only changes in the lifestyle factors that caused it in the first place will reverse the problem, and a terrible problem it is! Even with \"expert\" symptomatic treatment (remember\u2014 this just suppresses symptoms but doesn't change the underlying \"disease\") the ravages of diabetes continue. In the U.K., one in eight diabetics ends up having a limb amputated! Many others go blind or end up on kidney dialysis or needing a kidney transplant\u2014 which also creates a life-long customer for anti-rejection drugs! Money, money, money! But curing diabetes is NOT good for business, so the status quo continues! Likewise, heart disease and strokes are almost entirely preventable. Atherosclerosis\u2014plaque in the arteties\u2014 is at least partially reversible, too. Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans, a cause of death that was extremely rare only a little over a century ago. Cancer, considered the number two cause of death in the U.S. is highly preventable and often curable IF the actual cause is addressed and corrected. The \"elephant in the room\" here is that almost no regular Oncologists understand the cause of cancer, and their rate of actual recovery is abysmal except for the non-solid tumor types. No, cancer is not a genetic disease or caused by damaged chromosomes. Researchers have been \"barking up that wrong tree\" for decades, which explains the billions upon billions of dollars down the research drain with so little to show for it, including genetic \"therapies\" that kill people quicker than if they did nothing at all. But that is actually \"par for the course\" with cancer treatments \u2014 the majority of cancer patients actually are killed by their \"trestments\" and not by the cancer! And the cancer \"experts\" love to play with the statistics. If you live one day past five years you get entered as a cure (or remission) even if you die from the cancer the next day! Plus, all standard treatment modalities tend to make you worse! Chemo and radiation both cause cancers, and biopsies and surgeries spread cancers. And all of the \"big three\" treatments damage the immune system, often irreparably. Perhaps even worse is the psychological trauma. Because standard treatments have such a high failure rate, many people assume they were just handed a death sentence upon being given the diagnosis of cancer. But survivors can be so damaged by \"treatment\" that they later wish that had not done it at all: a form of \"buyers' remorse\". Surgeries mutilate. Chemo (and sometimes radiation) causes widespread and brutal damage to many bodily systems, often causing lifelong impairments and disabilities, including pain, permanently affecting their quality of life for the worse. These treatments are a terrible problem because no drugs or radiation can actually cure cancer. NONE! It is only the person's immune system that finishes off cancer cells. All chemotherapy or radistion can do is \"debulk\" or shrink the tumor. They almost never actually kill off all of the cancer cells. It is the IMMUNE system that swings into action and kills the cancer, but both chemo and radiation seriously damage immunity. And stress and fear very effectively shut down the immune system, just when it is needed the most! Newly diagnosed cancer patients often are rushed into starting these treatments before they can research alternatives or get another opinion, and rushing is seldom justified \u2014 if the cancer is so advanced that there is \"no time to waste\", it is probably too late for allopathic treatments to help, anyway, and to survive, the patient must seek out therapeutics that deliver better results. Cancer is a problem of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired energy metabolism. It is a metabolic disease and requires metabolic treatment. Allopathic modalities have a high failure rate for anything but early, non-metastasized tumors and the non-solid-tumor blood and lymphatic cancers. The main problem is that \"standard of care\" treatments don't treat the real cause, and they hardly ever effectively treat cancer stem cells, the actual source of the tumor. Instead they usually only kill off the inconsequential \"daughter cells\" that make up the bulk of tumors but are not the dangerous real problem that spreads and kills people. Patients go through treatment and are relieved to be told, \"The tumor is shrinking\", but it didn't actually kill the resistant stem cells, and soon after the treatment is over, the cancer \"explodes\" into growth with chemo-resistant mutations and the patient dies. The most important question any cancer patient can ask the Oncologist is, \"Will this treatment target the stem cells\"? If that doctor doesn't know, go find another doctor! Also, if that doctor knows nothing about nutrition and cancer, and he/she still thinks its okay for you to eat anything you want, especially sugar (that feeds cancer cells)\u2014 go find another doctor IMMEDIATELY! All the details will be covered in the forthcoming article on cancer, as will diabetes and cardiovascular diease prevention and treatment be covered in the future. If what I will present is information with which your doctor is already aware, you are very lucky, because most doctors are just too busy to stay up to date on the research. The disturbing truth is that it takes ten or even twenty years for pure biochemical/biomedical research to filter down into clinical practice and be applied to patient care. On the whole, doctors are practicing outdated \"Dark Ages\" medicine, even mostly what they were taught 'way back in medical school, and their patients are suffering because of it. It is the rare doctor in this age of running patients through the office like cattle who takes sufficient time to really dig into the source of a problem, and rare for a doctor to do the necessary background research (with their often corporate-mandated fifteen-minutes-per patient schedule). All this is why so many patients just get outdated and useless treatments. Cholesterol-lowering Stain drugs are a prime example. Their doctors are hopelessly behind the times and have not yet learned that Statins do much more harm than good. In fact, they do almost no good at all! Statistically, someone has to be treated with a Statin drug for about five years to extend their life by an additional four days! And in the meantime that treatment with highly toxic and dangerous Statins can cause cognitive difficulties, memory loss, dementia, peripheral neuropathies, permanent muscle damage, and even Parkinson's, and seriously increase the risk of cancer. And on top of all that, they can cause heart failure! But guess what? People with higher cholesterol live longer! Cholesterol is a very vital substance that is good for you. The body is not stupid. It knows you need it. But does your doctor know it (and all this)? Probably not! Medicine (as in the Medical IndustrialComplex) has turned out to be among the biggest scams on the planet, and the pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable (of mostly-legal enterprises, that is\u2014but human and child trafficking net even more). And now the Chinese Communist-run World Health Organization, the WHO, is jockying to force its Pandemic Treaty on the world. This will dissolve national sovereignty and make all nations and all people on Eath subservient to it: a group of unelected, stupid, megalomaniac control freaks who are committed to mass population reduction through mass genocide with bioweapon shots, sterilization, energy reduction and starvation, and who wants to control all medical systems, food, transportation, and censor communications, track and trace the populations with \"Vaccine Passports\", CBDCs, microchips, and \"social credit scores\"! Every country needs to throw out any politician who is in favor of this nightmare Globalist takeover! Defund the WHO and PULL OUT of it! Likewise: get OUT of the U.N.! It was never designed to help humanity, but rather to control and depopulate us. "}
