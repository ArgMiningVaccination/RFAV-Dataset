They are not strict protocols, and they do not replace the judgement of a senior clinician. Clinical common-sense should be applied at all times. These clinical guidelines should never be relied on as a substitute for proper assessment with respect to the particular circumstances of each case and the needs of each patient. Clinicians should also consider the local skill level available and their local area policies before following any guideline. [Read the full CAHS Clinical disclaimer.](http://pch.health.wa.gov.au/For-health-professionals/Emergency-Department-Guidelines/CAHS-disclaimer) Aim To guide PCH Emergency Department (ED) staff in the appropriate use of analgesia in the ED. Background - Painful medical conditions and injuries in children are a common presentation to the ED. - Pain is more challenging to diagnose and assess in children in comparison to adults and as a result, is often untreated or under treated in children. - Sub-optimal analgesia can result in delaying a child's recovery and increasing their risk of developing chronic pain. Assessment - Older children can use numerical or visual analogue scales to self-report pain. - Physiological and behavioural parameters can be used in patients of all ages to assess pain. - It is important to obtain an accurate history from the parent/carer on the child's pain. - Reassessment of pain is important after providing analgesia. - Refer to Assessment of [Acute Pain in infants, Children, and Adolescents](https://healthpoint.hdwa.health.wa.gov.au/policies/Policies/CAHS/PCH.CPM.PainAssessment.pdf) - Clinical Practice Manual (internal WA Health only) or [Pain Assessment and Management](https://www.cahs.health.wa.gov.au/-/media/HSPs/CAHS/Documents/Health-Professionals/Neonatology-guidelines/Pain-Assessment-and-Management.pdf) - Neonatology Guidelines (internal WA Health only) Management - Non-pharmacological strategies, including psychological and physical techniques, are an important adjunct to medications. - Consider KKIND principles (Keeping Kids in No Distress) e.g. distraction techniques such as blowing bubbles, singing and storytelling are a useful adjunct to analgesic medications, especially during painful procedures. - Analgesics should be prescribed according to pain intensity. - Opioids should rarely be given without a simple analgesic such as paracetamol which provides adjunctive pain relief. - Local anaesthetic and nerve blocking agents provide effective analgesia in suitable patients. Femoral nerve block should be used early and before transport of any child with a fractured femur. Refer to [Femoral Nerve Block](http://pch.health.wa.gov.au/For-health-professionals/Emergency-Department-Guidelines/Femoral-nerve-block) - ED Guideline - Painful lacerations may be managed with topical local anaesthetic preparations such as adrenaline (epinephrine) + tetracaine (amethocaine) + lidocaine (lignocaine) Laceraine\u00ae gel or local anaesthetic infiltration. - Painful oral stomatitis can be managed with lidocaine (lignocaine) viscous. Options for commonly used analgesics for children in the ED Mild to moderate pain Sucrose1 - For minor procedures like immunisation, removal of adhesive tapes and blood tests. Dosage: - Preterm infant (postmenstrual age 32-40 weeks), oral 0.2-0.5 mL per procedure; maximum 2.5 mL in 24 hours. - Birth (at term) - 1 month, oral 0.5-1 mL per procedure; maximum 5 mL in 24 hours. - 1-18 months, oral 1-2 mL per procedure; maximum 5 mL in 24 hours if aged <3 months, or 10 mL in 24 hours if >3 months. Administration: Only effective when placed on the tongue. Drop one-quarter (or less) of the total dose onto the anterior of the tongue 2 minutes before starting the procedure, give the remainder of the dose incrementally throughout the procedure as required. Onset: Give 2 minutes prior to commencing the procedure. Peak effect: Time to maximal effect is approximately 2 minutes, duration of effect is approximately 5-10 minutes.2 Efficacy data in preterm infants <32 weeks postmenstrual age or infants >12 months are limited. Monitoring: Pre-administration and ongoing pain assessment. Paracetamol Precautions: - Use adjusted body weight when calculating paracetamol dose.
