Naturopathic doctors (NDs) teach their patients to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes and cutting edge natural therapies to enhance their bodies' ability to ward off and combat disease. NDs view the patient as a complex, interrelated system (a whole person), not as a clogged artery or a tumor. Naturopathic physicians craft comprehensive treatment plans that blend the best of modern medical science and traditional natural medical approaches to not only treat disease, but to also restore health. Naturopathic physicians get a rigorous medical education with the same basic sciences as allopathic physicians and base their practice on six timeless principles founded on medical tradition and scientific evidence. - Let nature heal Our bodies have such a powerful, innate instinct for self-healing. By finding and removing the barriers to this self-healing\u2014such as poor diet or unhealthy habits\u2014naturopathic physicians can nurture this process. - Identify and treat causes Naturopathic physicians understand that symptoms will only return unless the root illness is addressed. Rather than cover up symptoms, they seek to find and treat the cause of these symptoms. - First, do no harm Naturopathic physicians follow three precepts to ensure their patients' safety: - Use low-risk procedures and healing compounds\u2014such as dietary supplements, herbal extracts and homeopathy\u2014with few or no side effects. - When possible, do not suppress symptoms, which are the body's efforts to self-heal. For example, the body may cook up a fever in reaction to a bacterial infection. Fever creates an inhospitable environment for the harmful bacteria, thereby destroying it. Of course, the naturopathic physician would not allow the fever to get dangerously high. - Customize each diagnosis and treatment plan to fit each patient. We all heal in different ways and the naturopathic physician respects our differences. - Educate patients Naturopathic doctors believes that doctors must be educators, as well as physicians. That's why naturopathic physicians teach their patients how to eat, exercise, relax and nurture themselves physically and emotionally. They also encourage self-responsibility and work closely with each patient. - Treat the whole person We each have a unique physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, sexual and spiritual makeup. The naturopathic physician knows that all these factors affect our health. That's why he or she includes them in a carefully tailored treatment strategy. - Prevent illness \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" has never been truer. Proactive medicine saves money, pain, misery and lives. That's why naturopathic physicians evaluate risk factors, heredity and vulnerability to disease. By getting treatment for greater wellness, we're less likely to need treatment for future illness. Your health is an investment The cost of Naturopathic Medicine can cause hesitation for some who would like to make an appointment. Is it worth the cost? Absolutely!! Let's consider the cost of conventional medical care. Insurance may cover a 5-10 minute visit with a doctor at a cost of $25-$125 copay and the monthly cost of insurance, minimum of $800 monthly. Without insurance, a visit to the doctor may still be 5-10 minutes and average cost of $90 which works out to be an average of $540/hour. The initial visit with a naturopathic doctor can be anywhere from $120-$250 but the doctor will be working with you for an hour and sometimes longer. If needed, the doctor may do some research outside your visit so you get a treatment plan that is specific to your case. The doctors in our office take the time to find out what has worked for you in the past, works with you to come up with a plan and that you understand your condition and the treatment. Naturopathic Medicine is an investment in your future health. Our visits address your concerns of today but we don't stop there. We consider your risk factors for other health concerns. We want to see you at your absolute best health so you can do the things you love. Take a look at our principles above and see if they resonant with you. Please don't misunderstand.
