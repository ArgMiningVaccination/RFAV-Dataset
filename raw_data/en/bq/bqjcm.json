Current Clinical Trials | | An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 2 Doses of 100g BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, given to a Population of Adults in Good General Health Who have Received 3 doses of 300g BG505 SOSIP.GT1.1 gp140 Vaccine, Adjuvanted This research study tests an experimental vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The purpose of this study is to find out if the study vaccine, BG505 SOSIP.GT1.1 gp140, is safe and how your immune system responds to it. BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 is a protein that is man-made. It was created to look and behave like the envelope protein, the protein that sits on top of the outer surface of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In testing, BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 has been shown to be safe and able to make antibodies against HIV. Participation in the study will last for about 15.25 months after the first vaccination. The study as a whole will last about 29 months.

For phase 1, two cohorts will be explored (18-64 age group and 65+ age group) for a total of 72 subjects. The subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either placebo or JCXH-221. A low dose of JCXH-221 will be explored vs placebo for each age group first. A high dose for those 2 cohorts will be explored once all safety data is reviewed. Once all of Phase 1 data has been reviewed, Phase 2 enrollment will open. In this portion of the trial, subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either JCXH-221 or a FDA approved Active comparator (Pfizer, Moderna, etc.). A total of 190 patients will be enrolled. ENROLLMENT OPEN ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: | | A Phase 1/2 Randomized, Observer-Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Modified RNA Vaccine Against Varicella Zoster Virus in Healthy Individuals The purpose of this clinical study is to learn about the safety, extent of the side effects (reaction to vaccine), and immune response (your immune system's reaction) of the study vaccine called Varicella Zoster Virus modRNA (VZV modRNA). We are seeking for healthy participants who are between 50 and 69 years of age. This study will be conducted in 2 substudies: Substudy A (Phase 1) and Substudy B (Phase 2). In substudy A, participants will receive 1 of 3 VZV modRNA vaccine candidates (different construct, different dose levels and different formulation [frozen or freeze dry powder]) or the approved shingles vaccine intramuscularly. Participants will be assigned in 1 of 9 groups and will receive 2 doses of vaccine at different intervals. In substudy B, participants will receive either VZV modRNA vaccine at selected dose level/schedule/formulation or approved shingles vaccine. This selection will be determined from Substudy A. ENROLLMENT OPEN ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: | | Hookworm Vaccine Trial - Experimental Infection Hookworm-na\u00efve Adults With Dermally-applied Infectious Necator Americanus Hookworm Larvae Necator americanus hookworm larvae. An experimental hookworm infection model is being developed to provide early proof-of-concept that a hookworm vaccine targeting the blood-feeding pathway of adult hookworms is feasible and efficacious. The proposed model consists of vaccinating healthy, hookworm-na\u00efve adults with a candidate hookworm vaccine, followed by challenging them with the investigational product, Necator americanus Larval Inoculum to assess the effect of vaccination on infection. The first proposed study will be a feasibility study that will consist of administering different doses of the Necator americanus Larval Inoculum to healthy adult volunteers to determine the optimal dose (i.e., number of infectious larvae) that is safe, well-tolerated and results in consistent infection. ENROLLMENT OPEN ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: | | A Phase 2 Randomized Multisite Trial to Inform Public Health Strategies Involving the Use of MVA-BN Vaccine for Mpox This study is a Phase 2 randomized, open-label, non-placebo controlled, multi-site clinical trial that will evaluate two ID regimens for MVA-BN vaccine compared to the standard SC regimen in healthy, vaccinia-na\u00efve adults 18 to 50 years of age, inclusive, (Stage 1). In Stage 2 of the study, the standard SC regimen will be evaluated in adolescents ages 12 through 17 years, inclusive, and compared to the standard SC regimen in adults ages 18 to 50, inclusive.

ENROLLMENT COMPLETE ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: | | Monkeypox Vaccine Trial - A Phase 2 Randomized, Open-Label, Multisite Trial to Evaluate the Immunogenicity of Dose Reduction Strategies of the MVA-BN Vaccine (DMID 22-0020) This phase 2 multisite clinical trial will evaluate two intradermal (ID) regimens for Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine compared to the standard subcutaneous (SC) regimen in healthy, vaccinia-na\u00efve adults 18 to 50 years of age. ENROLLMENT COMPLETE ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: | | Schistosomiasis Vaccine Trial - Sm-TSP-2 Schistosomiasis Vaccine in Healthy Ugandan Adults Two-part clinical trial of a vaccine to protect against schistosomiasis caused by infection with S. mansoni. Two formulations of the Sm-TSP-2 vaccine will be tested; one using Alhydrogel\u00ae plus AP 10-702, each at 3 different doses of antigen: 10mcg, 30mcg, and 100mcg. The first part of the study will be a Phase 1 dose-escalation safety and immunogenicity study followed by a Phase IIb trial in which a large number of adults will be enrolled to assess the impact of the vaccine on infection with S. mansoni. The impact of the vaccine on infection with S. haematobium will also be assessed although this will be exploratory given that potential cross-protection against this species is only hypothetical at this point.
