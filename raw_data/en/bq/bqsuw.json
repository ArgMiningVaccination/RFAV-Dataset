With this in mind we have employed a colour coded format that divides the county and city into different coded colours so that each local area has it's own colour. The Directory begins with a list of health services that are provided in the Cork area. Following this are two sections on key statutory and voluntary services. The vast majority of community and voluntary services will be listed in the local community sections, which forms the main body of the Directory.Each colour coded section will have a comprehensive summary of eldercare services and groups that are located in that area.The Directory also contains a 'Useful Number' section that we hope will be invaluable in steering readers to information that may not be available in their own areas such as relevant national organisations. We sincerely hope this document will be of assistance to you. ______________ ______________ ____________ _______________ Tony Fitzgerald Brendan Scahill Tr\u00edona Healy Stephen Murphy (HSE, Steering Group for this Project) 5CONTENTS: Health Services in Cork City & County 7 Key Regional Services 34 Key Regional Voluntary Services 41 North and East Cork Mitchelstown / Fermoy / Rathcormac / Kilworth / Charleville / Buttevant 68 Northside May eld / The Glen / Montenotte / Ballyvolane 76 Farranree / Fairhill 78 Gurranabraher / eld 79 Knocknaheeny / Hollyhill 81 Shandon / Blackpool / North City Centre 82 Blarney / Tower 85 Southside Bishopstown / Ballincollig / Ovens / Farran 90 Ballyphehane / Togher / Turners Cross 94 South City Centre / The Lough / South Parish 97 Douglas / Grange / Frank eld 99 Ballinlough / Blackrock / Mahon 101 Monkstown / / / / / Islands Dunmanway Bantry Drimoleague Glengarriff / Coachford / Ballyvourney / Crookstown 130 Useful Numbers 1 3 4 In developing this directory, the Community Work Department liaised with other key groupings and local community Network groups in order to ensure that all local eldercare groups are included.
