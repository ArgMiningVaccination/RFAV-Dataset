The company has tied up with Ambootia or the Darjeeling Organic Tea Estates Private Ltd, which is one of the oldest organic tea producers in the country. According to Ameve Sharma, Founder, Kapiva, atleast four different flavours of tea would be launched next month. The company currently offers a range of juices, ghee and honey and a few other wellness products. \"The pilot was launched about six months ago and now we are set to go for the commercial launch. Ambootia will provide their green teas and we will infuse the herbs,\" Sharma told BusinessLine . While initially it would be available in tea bag format, however, the company is also working on launching loose tea. Growing demand The rising awareness about the ill-effects of processed food and switch among consumers towards healthy food has led to increasing acceptance for functional foods. This has contributed to a steady growth in the company's turnover, which grew by over 12 times this year over last year. Kapiva is hopeful of clocking a turnover of Rs 100 crore by end of FY-20 and achieving close to Rs 200-300 crore revenues in the next two-to-three years. The company, which was initially also offering products in personal care category, is now more focused on the foods segment. \"We had one or two personal care products, but now our entire focus in on the foods segment and we are growing it in a significant manner,\" he said. Sourcing Sourcing of raw material is the most vital part of its strategy as it helps ensure quality. Hence the company has tied up with over 100 farmers for sourcing different varieties of herbs and natural produce. Kapiva claims to sell 100 per cent A2 cow ghee or those procured from the milk of desi cows. Its honey is also collected from dense forest. \"Having the Baidyanath heritage helped us get the backward integration in place. We have been tying up with farmers across the country for various raw materials,\" he said. In fact, Sharma, who is also the President of Baidyanath Group, said that the group is exploring possibility of acquiring an agri company for backward integration and sourcing of raw material. The company is likely to invest close to $2-5 million over the next three-to-four years in acquiring and scaling up the agri supply chain venture. \"We are currently in talks to invest in a company, which is purely in agri space. The plan is to buy around 1000 acres of land in a place, which is near the Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra border, and start growing herbs in that area. We will then extend training to farmers around that area thereby extending the coverage,\" he said. "}
