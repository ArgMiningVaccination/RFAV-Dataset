It is important for an adult to get vaccinated regularly, else there are always chances that some virus or infection may attack you in a severe way. Let's look at some of the vaccines adults should get for a healthy and ensured life:Pneumococcal Vaccine - This vaccine protects the human body from diseases like Pneumonia and Meningitis. Who should get this vaccine? How many vaccine shots should I get? PCV 13 and PPSV23 is prescribed to the elderly over the age of 60. PCV13 is to be taken at first and PPSV23 to be taken one year after the first shot. Hepatitis Vaccine - Strains of Hepatitis Viruses like A, B and C attack the Liver and can cause Liver failure in adults. There are vaccines to prevent the human body from Type A and Type B. However, there's no vaccine for hepatitis C yet. Who can get it? When to get it? Hepatitis vaccine can be taken during any time of the year. Vaccine options for Flu: Vaccine options for Typhoid: Vaccine options for Pneumococcal: Vaccine option for Hepatitis A: Vaccine for Hepatitis B: Human body is vulnerable throughout its life. Deadly viruses can attack our body anytime, and we must stay prepared and ahead of them. The vaccines mentioned above would help in avoiding some of the common but dangerous diseases. The immune system is extremely important in an individual's system. A strong immune system helps to combat the invasion of foreign particles and consequently resists the diseases. Vaccination is such a context becomes imperative as it strengthens an individual's immunity. In vaccination, antigens or germs are given in very small doses. They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to fight against that particular infection. Vaccinations are provided to both children to protect them from a number of diseases. However, different vaccinations are provided at different ages according to the susceptibility to diseases. Some of the vaccinations that are provided to newborns are: 1. Hepatitis B vaccine: This vaccination is given in order to prevent the child from having Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a liver disease that if persists can lead to liver failure or even liver cancer. This vaccine must be injected immediately after the birth of the baby. The first dose must be followed by administering a second dose within a span of a month or two. 2. Rotavirus Vaccine (RV): This vaccine, taken orally, prevents the infant from Rotavirus. This virus causes vomiting and diarrhoea in children that often leads to severe dehydration. This vaccine is administered within two to four months of the baby's birth. Sometimes, on a doctor's prescription, a second dose may be necessary for the sixth month. 3. Acellular Pertussis Vaccine and Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids: This is a combination of various vaccines that protects the child from tetanus and diphtheria. Newborns are extremely prone to diphtheria that causes fatal illness and sometimes even deaths in children. This vaccination thereby, is extremely important and must be administered within two or four months and must be followed up with secondary doses later under the doctor's supervision.

Vaccinations do not end with childhood. In many cases adults too need to be vaccinated against certain diseases. Some of them are: Human Papillomavirus ( [HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv)) is a group of 200 viruses. 40 of these are transmitted through direct sexual contact. The infections from papillomavirus can cause [penile cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-penile-cancer) and anal cancer, [oropharyngeal cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-oropharyngeal-cancer), vaginal cancer in women. The Human Papillomavirus is used to prevent such diseases. Transmission and [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection) from HPV The symptoms of the HPV infection usually develop years after the first contact. Therefore, there is a huge possibility of transmission of the virus during intimate. HPV virus may be of a high-risk variety or a low-risk variety. The high-risk HPV produces two proteins. These deactivate the tumour suppressing genes. This leads to abnormal growth of cells that causes cancer. Cervical cancer is the most common form of HPV infection. In India over 1,22,000 women are diagnosed annually from HPV related cancers. Of them, 67,000 women die annually. Thus, India has the highest HPV related deaths in the world. Using [HPV vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/doctors-for-hpv-vaccination) when a person becomes sexually active is the only preventive method. HPV Vaccine HPV vaccine is used to produce [antibodies](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/torch-screen-antibodies/health-feed) against the virus that prevent them from infecting the cells. It contains virus-like particles. These are not [infectious](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/infectious-panel/health-feed) despite having the structure of a virus. The vaccine promotes antibody production and prevents future infections. HPV vaccine is quite effective if an individual is immunised before becoming sexually active. The [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) requires three shots given over a period of 6 months if you are beetween age 13-26. All girls before marriage should take this vaccine. It is single best vaccine which can prevent genital cancer in women. [HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv) refers to Human Papillomavirus. This is a common virus, which has got more than 100 different types and over 40 of these types are transmitted sexually. This virus may cause [cervical cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cervical-cancer) and cases of [genital warts](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/genital-warts). It is likely to occur in people who are sexually active to contract genital HPV, and it is not accompanied by any signs or symptoms. The virus is transmitted via skin to skin contact and is severely [infectious](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/infectious-panel/health-feed) in nature. Using condoms may reduce the risk of spreading of this virus, but is not always successful. There are two major vaccines for HPV. Reasons for [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) against HPV HPV vaccines are recommended to girls between 11 and 12 years. It is also given to girls and women between the age of 13 and 26 years, who have never been vaccinated against HPC before. These vaccines should be given to females before they start being active sexually and get exposed to the HPV virus. Sexually active females benefit from these vaccines as well, but the effect is less. Here are three reasons why you should vaccinate against HPV: HPV vaccines are a series of effective vaccines, which prevent the occurrence of cervical cancer and other cancers which are sexually transmitted. They are generally given to women before getting sexually active to prevent transmission of HPV viruses. Some HPV vaccines are prescribed to males as well. If you wish to discuss about any specific problem, you can [consult a doctor](https://www.lybrate.com/pune/doctor/dr-ramesh-maheshwari-sexologist-1) and ask a free question. [Flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu) is caused by a virus known as influenza and is a common respiratory disease. It is typically caused from the month of October to May. Some of the common symptoms include [fatigue](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fatigue), runny nose, [fever](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fever), [cough](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cough), muscle ache, [sore throat](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/sore-throat), [body ache](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-body-ache), etc. The flu [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) helps to protect from influenza. The effect generally lasts for a year. It is recommended that an individual takes this vaccination once in a year since the strain of the virus keeps changing every year. Flu vaccine comprises of an egg-based technology. Who Can catch flu? Anyone can get a flu vaccination. Children above the age of 6 months or more are eligible to get a flu vaccination. In addition, the person who has a severe outbreak of [allergic reaction](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/allergic-reaction) due to the flu vaccination should also stay away from this. Pregnant women can also get this vaccination without any worry about the baby. They not only safeguard the mother, but protect the child from influenza too. Adults who are more than 65 years old can take this vaccination without worrying. Patients with an acute [allergy](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/allergy) should consult their doctors before taking a flu shot. Are there any side effects? Although most people do not feel a thing after the flu shot, some might experience mild symptoms, such as redness of the area where the vaccine has been injected, mild body aches, soreness, redness and fever. Other serious side effects include allergic reaction resulting in soreness and very high fever. A doctor or healthcare personnel should be immediately contacted in such an instance. Can flu shot cause flu? This is totally a myth. A flu vaccine doesn't result in the flu. The virus content of the flu vaccine doesn't contain any live virus that can potentially trigger an outbreak of flu in the body. They are noninfectious in every sense of the word. It takes a couple of weeks for the flu vaccine to build immunity in the body. A person might get affected during this time if he comes in contact with an infected person. Confusing flu with similar symptoms: Common symptoms of flu such as [nausea](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/nausea), [vomiting](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vomiting), [sneezing](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-sneezing), body ache and fever can be symptoms of an entirely different disease such as [diarrhoea](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/diarrhoea). Until the tests are conducted and the doctor gives an assured verdict of flu, it is unwise to take a flu vaccination based on gut feel and mere speculation. When is an ideal time to take flu vaccine? There is no right or wrong time of taking a flu shot. It is seriously [infectious](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/infectious-panel/health-feed) and can catch hold of a person at any time. The right time to take a flu shot is now. It is readily available over the counter and can be injected at any time of the year. Many animals receive \"kennel cough\" vaccines that include bordetella and cpi and cav-2 every 6 to 9 months without evidence that this frequency of [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) is necessary or beneficial. In contrast, other dogs are never vaccinated for kennel [cough](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cough) and diseases are not seen. Cpi immunity lasts at least 3 years when given intranasally and cav -2 immunity lasts a minimum of 7 years parenterally for cav-i. These two virus in combination with bordetella bronchiseptica are the agents, which are often associated with kennel cough, however, other factors play an important role in diseases (eg. [Stress](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/stress-disorder), dust, humidity, molds, [mycoplasma](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/mycoplasma-culture-urine), etc.). Thus, kennel cough is not a vaccine preventable disease because of the complex factors associated with this disease. Furthermore, this is often a mild to moderate self limiting disease. It's just like [common cold](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-of-common-cold) in humans. A course of antibiotics usually is enough to treat the condition. I generally do not recommend kennel cough vaccines unless dogs are staying in a boarding facility that requires them. [HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv) refers to Human Papillomavirus. This is a common virus, which has got more than 100 different types and over 40 of these types are transmitted sexually. This virus may cause [cervical cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cervical-cancer) and cases of [genital warts](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/genital-warts).

During [pregnancy](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pregnancy), [flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu) (influenza) can impose serious health implications for both the mother and the child. Due to pregnancy, the risk of developing complications like [pneumonia](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pneumonia) are very high, which can pose as a problem during childbirth. [Miscarriage](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/miscarriage), low birth weight, premature birth are some of the major issues, which might develop if the mother has suffered from flu during her pregnancy. Although flu [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) during pregnancy has certain risks, it has been observed that in most cases the benefits of [inactivated](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/inactivated-influenza-vaccine) influenza vaccine outweigh the risks. However, Live attenuated influenza vaccine is not recommended at all during pregnancy. Recommendations across the world suggest that prevention of influenza by administration of inactivated influenza vaccine is the best intervention in pregnancy. The vaccine for Flu should be administered before the onset of flu season. RANZCOG, NHS UK, RCOG, FOGSI recommends inactivated flu vaccine for all the pregnant women unless there are any contraindications. Taking inactivated influenza vaccine can be beneficial in multiple ways: Some concerns Often, one [fear](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fear) about the vaccine, is the development of Gullain Barre syndrome. This is very rare and the risk of GBS are higher following influenza like illness. Also, if the patient is allergic to eggs they are advised to consult a physician. Flu vaccines have traces of egg [protein](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/protein-benefits-sources-and-side-effects) in it. Certain precautions are taken after studying the patient's medical history. The doctor may keep the patient under observation. Or in certain instances the physician might suggest alternative flu vaccine, which do not contain egg protein. Physicians decide it after studying any prior [allergic reaction](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/allergic-reaction). As per the WHO SAGE position paper, from 1990 to 2009 the vaccine adverse event reporting system database in USA reported only 20 serious adverse events following administration of trivalent influenza vaccine to an estimated 11.8 million pregnant women.
