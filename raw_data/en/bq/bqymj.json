It is not an illness and there is no cure. If you're autistic, a GP or local autism team may suggest approaches that can help you to: - develop daily living skills - develop communication skills - manage other physical or mental health conditions, such as pain or anxiety - manage harmful behaviours But there are also treatments and approaches that are not recommended because either: - they're fake - there's evidence that they're harmful - the research and evidence show no benefit to autistic people - or there's no good research into them Treatments for autism that are fake or can be harmful Some products or services, claiming to be cures or treatments for autism, are fake or can be harmful. Examples of these include: - GcMAF - an unlicensed injection made from blood cells - bleaching - also called chlorine dioxide (CD) or Mineral Miracle Solution (MMS) - CEASE, which discourages vaccinations and recommends potentially dangerous levels of nutritional supplements - chelation - removing heavy metal toxins from the blood - secretin - a hormone found in the body - some vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements - raw camel's milk Do not use any of these to treat autism. How to spot fake treatments There are some warning signs that may suggest a treatment is fake: - it claims to \"cure\" or help people \"recover from\" autism - it claims to cure lots of different conditions - it claims to work in most people and have quick results - personal stories are used to claim it works, rather than medical evidence - words like \"miracle\", \"faith\" and \"trust\" are used - it can be done by anyone without any training or qualifications - it costs a lot of money - it is not available on the NHS How to report fake treatments You can help stop people selling dangerous treatments by reporting anything you think might be fake. For a product bought in England or Wales, call the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 0808 223 1133 or [contact the Citizens Advice consumer service using an online form](https://ssl.datamotion.com/form.aspx?co=3438&frm=general&to=flare.fromforms). For a medicine you think might be fake, visit the [FakeMeds campaign on the GOV.UK website](https://fakemeds.campaign.gov.uk/). For an advert for a fake treatment in the media, on a website or on social media, [make a complaint using the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) website](https://www.asa.org.uk/make-a-complaint.html). Other treatments that are not recommended The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will only recommend something if there is good evidence that it benefits autistic people. Research into the following approaches has not shown any benefit for autistic people and they are not recommended: - hyperbaric oxygen therapy - treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber - neurofeedback for speech and language problems - trying to change brain activity - auditory integration training for speech and language problems - therapy using music - omega-3 fatty acids - for sleep problems - exclusion diets - such as gluten-free or casein-free diets and ketogenic diets - oxytocin - a hormone If you're considering a treatment that is not recommended by NICE, speak to a GP or local autism team to discuss the risks.
