Therapy With Hers Mental Health Therapy on Hers Mental Health is intended for women, 18 years and older, experiencing anxiety, depression, stress, or burnout. Sessions are 50 minutes long and held by video. All of the therapists on the platform are licensed and hold either a doctorate or master's degree in psychology, counseling or a related field. When you sign up for the service, you are automatically matched with a therapist. If you are unhappy with your assigned therapist, you can select a new one and are able to browse through the directory of providers. The directory can be a bit difficult to navigate compared to other platforms and the therapist profiles do not give you much information about the provider's treatment approach. Some therapists are able to accommodate evening or weekend appointments. Generally, it can take a few days to meet with a therapist. In my experience, I was able to schedule an appointment within four days. One of the unique features of Hers Mental Health is that you will have access to videos on mental health topics, like \"ease for anxiety\" and \"relief for depression.\" These videos are only available through the app and cannot be accessed through the website. There is also a progress tracker available on the website where you can track your anxiety and depression symptoms over time and monitor your progress. I found the videos and progress tracker helpful, but it was a bit confusing that certain activities could only be accessed through the app and others only on the website. Therapists Credentials All of the therapists on the Hers platform have met all of the qualifications of licensure in the state(s) that they practice. Their therapists include doctorate-level psychologists and masters-level therapists. All of the therapists on the platform are trained to treat anxiety, depression, stress, and burnout.

Once you find a therapist that appears to be a good fit, you can view their availability and schedule an appointment.

Final Verdict on Hers Mental Health Hers Mental Health offers medication, therapy, and wellness supplements for adult women. This platform is ideal for women experiencing anxiety or depression who would like fast and convenient service. You can get prescribed medication for anxiety or depression without ever speaking with a psychiatrist. Therapy with Hers Mental health is cost effective, especially for anyone without insurance. In my opinion, the service is affordable and convenient, but is not right for everyone. This is why Hers earned 3 out of 5 stars overall during our independent review of its platform. Being prescribed medication for depression or anxiety without meeting with a psychiatrist can be risky for some people. If you have never been prescribed psychiatric medication before, I would recommend having a full evaluation with another provider first. Hers Mental Health's medication services can then be used for refills if you are already established on a medication. Overall, this platform may be good for some people, but if you are new to psychiatric medication or have any mental health issues other than anxiety and depression, I would caution against using this service.
