So, you may already be familiar with the fact that \"detoxing\" is the act of our body and skin ridding itself of toxins or any other harmful and potentially damaging substances. But while a lot of us are vaguely familiar with what it is, you may still be asking yourself why do I need to detox in the first place? One of the main sources of skin damage stems from environmental pollution that typically comes from the everyday air we breathe and are surrounded by. And whether you live in a highly congested city or a more widely-spaced neighborhood with more greenery, your skin will still undergo some kind of environmental damage either way. With that exposure to pollution, skin damage will manifest itself in two ways. The first, is that our DNA can actually be altered and damaged through air pollution and environmental aggressors. And second, pollution and aggressors can stimulate chronic inflammation and stress that not only causes internal damage but also manifests itself visibly in the skin, resulting in premature signs of aging. So in short, we have pollution and environmental aggressors to thank for causing our skin to age faster than we'd like, which in turn leads to us looking more haggard and fatigued. Fortunately, that's where the practice of detoxing comes to the rescue. However, in the vast world of the cosmetic industry, there are an overwhelming variety of instant detoxing treatments out there and an underwhelming amount of natural and effective choices to help us practice daily detoxification which is ultimately safer and healthier for our skin and body long-term.
