Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 7/3/2023 First time user and now a believer. So relaxing, almost fell asleep. Felt better immediately after - 5/13/2023 dr peng is amazing and he's a good friend of mine. He is also a professor at a local acupuncture university. I have gone to him so many times and my son has gone to him and we had a crisis with his finger and he had to play in a band in less than a week, I have many friends who have gone to him too, and it has gone very well for them. - 6/12/2023 Love Dr. Peng. This review has been way overdue. Dr Peng is a very knowledgeable and kind soul. I was having back issues due to bone on bone on my L4-5. His acupuncture helped me both before surgery, and after, speeding up my recovery. I still go to him for an overall health 'tune-up' to improve blood flow, open channels/pressure points and sleep! 10 stars!!! - 1/14/2022 If you want the sweetest kind man to put needles into your soul for healing this is the man. He couldn't be any more gentle. - 6/22/2022 I have tried other acupuncture locations that have helped with a preexisting condition but this place blows them out of the park! I had reluctantly participated on hikes and other physical activities because of the pain that accompanied them. Coming here, I was able to go on a 15 mile backpacking trip and there was no pain. Some discomfort several days later which is to be expected with my injury, but no pain. This isn't a cure but it is a tool to effectively manage pain, in my experience. I appreciate that he takes the time to explain why he is placing the needles where he places them since I have never had that before. Overall, he is professional and great at his job! - 2/2/2022 Dr. Peng is simply the best. He is so gentle and patient and knowledgeable. He doesn't try to push an agenda. He works with your insurance. He doesn't try to diagnose or pressure you into any unnecessary treatments. He is super brilliant and explains everything about the process and why we feel the way we do from a TCM perspective. The acupuncture is on point! No pun intended. It did wonders for my back and my overall tension and mood. It's worth mentioning that Dr. Peng is also a professor at a TCM school in So Cal. He knows what he is doing and you won't be disappointed. - 12/5/2020 I just went in for my first session of \"cupping\" along with acupuncture. It was a good experience and I am hopeful after a series of cupping sessions my neck pain might be remedied. Dr. Peng is very patient and takes the time to explain everything to you; he really makes you feel unrushed and informed. Looking forward to my next session. Thank you Dr. Peng. - 9/12/2020 Been going here on and off for years. Always able to get in quickly and the treatments have always helped with my back and hip pains. - 6/15/2020 I love coming to see Dr Peng for any or all ailments. He's helped me with an entire spectrum of pain from shoulder muscle tension, back pain, and pulled muscles. He listens to your concerns thoroughly and ensures that your concerns are put to ease. He's an amazing acupuncturist and the results are there! Last week I had tense pain in my shoulders and he was able to get them to release tension and the pain was eased within the day!!! He's great!! - 4/20/2019 I like this clinic. The doctor is really nice, and it is clean and smells good. He works great with insurances and is willing to work with you financially if needed. I recommend this place.
