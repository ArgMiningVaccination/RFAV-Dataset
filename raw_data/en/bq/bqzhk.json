We examine the role of city planning, food policy, and civic engagement in creating spaces for urban agriculture in cities across the United States, and whether (and how) these spaces promote food justice and food security. Bringing together multidisciplinary literature on access to urban agriculture and the distribution of urban-produced foods in a thematic, systematic review, we point out gaps in the academic research that would benefit from further study. The review integrates academic literature generated from Web of Science searches with gray literature identified through Google Alerts. We find that while there is a strong focus on elucidating the multiple benefits of urban agriculture, there are few studies that robustly measure the impact of urban farms on improving food security in low-income communities. Much of the literature is theoretical, focused on the production potential of urban agriculture, while more work is needed to understand and overcome barriers to access and distribution among communities in need. We conclude with a set of recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who seek to create spaces in cities for food justice, equity, access, and sovereignty.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-08-22", "cleaned_text": "Does Urban Agriculture Improve Food Security? Examining the Nexus of Food Access and Distribution of Urban Produced Foods in the United States: A Systematic Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/su10092988](https://doi.org/10.3390/su10092988) [Local Food Initiatives Over the past 10 years, there has been a proliferation of articles citing the multifaceted array of benefits attributed to urban agriculture. These span city greening and beautification to improved nutrition; public, and mental health; community food security; climate change mitigation; community [11](#B11-sustainability-10-02988), [12](#B12-sustainability-10-02988)]. Those highlighting the beneficial environmental and ecological impacts of urban agriculture cite reduced urban heat island effect, improved local air quality, improved stormwater quality (and reduced quantity), increased pollinator populations, and climate mitigation services, such as carbon sequestration [ [13](#B13-sustainability-10-02988), [14](#B14-sustainability-10-02988), [15](#B15-sustainability-10-02988)]. [1](#B1-sustainability-10-02988), [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988)]. In fact, there are few robust analyses that measure the actual social, economic and health impacts of urban agriculture, or the policy and governance environments and civic engagement frameworks in which UA models are effective in reducing food insecurity. Without understanding the actual links between UA and food security or which specific characteristics, models or approaches reduce insecurity, urban policymakers and advocates risk backing policies that could have unintended consequences or negative impacts on vulnerable individuals and communities. [17](#B17-sustainability-10-02988)]); for the purposes of city planning, the American Planning Association defines it as the \"production, marketing, and distribution of food and other products in metropolitan areas and at their edges, beyond what is strictly for home consumption or educational purposes\" (American Planning Association 2011). In its simplest form, UA is \"growing food in cities\" [ [2](#B2-sustainability-10-02988)]. For our purposes, we define UA broadly to encompass the full range of activities involved in urban food production including self-production and subsistence agriculture. In doing so, we follow scholars who have sought to measure the contributions of a wide range of UA activities [ [3](#B3-sustainability-10-02988), [6](#B6-sustainability-10-02988), [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988)]. [18](#B18-sustainability-10-02988)] and backyard gardens in Chicago [ [2](#B2-sustainability-10-02988)], predicting yield, to illustrate the production potential of UA. Others demonstrate, through case studies, the productivity of urban gardens and the value of the food they produce in meeting nutritional needs of low-income communities, particularly households involved in gardening directly (The benchmark productivity rate for urban agriculture used in Altieri's 2016 study of Eastern Bay Area urban farms is 10 kg/m2, the production level reached by intermediate Cuban farmers when they became international leaders in UA after separation from the Soviet Union.) [ [19](#B19-sustainability-10-02988), [20](#B20-sustainability-10-02988), [21](#B21-sustainability-10-02988), [22](#B22-sustainability-10-02988), [23](#B23-sustainability-10-02988)]. Robust theoretical analyses have emerged critiquing the risks of UA when approached without an equity lens, potentially reinforcing structural injustices and racism and negatively impacting the communities they purportedly serve (see [ [24](#B24-sustainability-10-02988)] and [ [25](#B25-sustainability-10-02988)] for specific examples of critiques of the hidden neoliberal ideology of urban food movements). [1](#B1-sustainability-10-02988), [26](#B26-sustainability-10-02988), [27](#B27-sustainability-10-02988)]. Designating land for agricultural use in urban areas may conflict with other city planning priorities around affordable housing, gentrification, and living. Because of the persistent legacy of systemic discrimination, it is neither inevitable nor guaranteed that urban agriculture will redress food system inequities; in fact, urban farms can sometimes lead to displacement through eco-gentrification [ [26](#B26-sustainability-10-02988), [28](#B28-sustainability-10-02988), [29](#B29-sustainability-10-02988), [30](#B30-sustainability-10-02988), [31](#B31-sustainability-10-02988)]. This is a particularly acute concern in areas experiencing housing pressures and population growth, such as the San Francisco Bay area and New York City. UA can also perpetuate positions of privilege within the food system by benefiting those who already hold power [ [1](#B1-sustainability-10-02988)]. [7](#B7-sustainability-10-02988), [24](#B24-sustainability-10-02988), [27](#B27-sustainability-10-02988), [32](#B32-sustainability-10-02988)]. These studies draw attention to agricultural history; complex historical relationships between minority communities and farming; land theft; and structural dynamics of power and privilege, critiquing those who uncritically accept the multiple benefits of urban agriculture. They question, \"who really benefits, and who loses in specific efforts to promote urban farms in the 'sustainable city' landscape?\" [ [24](#B24-sustainability-10-02988), [33](#B33-sustainability-10-02988), [34](#B34-sustainability-10-02988)] and, \"how can white food activists reframe their work so as not to fuel displacement of residents of color?\" [ [34](#B34-sustainability-10-02988)]. [Table 1](#sustainability-10-02988-t001)). In the food access literature, we review spatial analyses and other studies that identify challenges and opportunities for expanding healthy food access in low-income communities, with a particular focus on urban produced foods. Next, we explore what is understood about the distribution of urban-produced foods especially the challenges and tradeoffs urban farmers face between securing a viable income and meeting the food needs of low income customers. Lastly, we bring together the literatures on access to and distribution of urban produced foods to identify effective strategies urban farms employ to meet food access needs of urban communities. Our analysis reveals three key factors mediating the effect of UA on food security: the economic realities of achieving an economically viable urban farm, ( [Section 5.1](#sec5dot1-sustainability-10-02988)), the role of city policy and planning ( [Section 5.2](#sec5dot2-sustainability-10-02988)), and the importance of civic engagement in the urban food system ( [Section 5.3](#sec5dot3-sustainability-10-02988)). We seek to highlight examples from both the scholarly and gray literatures that demonstrate how UA can improve food access, distribution, and justice, in a way that supports both consumers and producers of food in cities. 2. Materials and Methods [Figure 1](#sustainability-10-02988-f001), and Web of Science added small numbers of articles to our systematic review. Terms were chosen based off keyword lists from articles in the database and results were screened for geographic relevance (U.S.) and mention of urban produced foods. These terms and search results bring up important questions of who prefers and uses which terms, and why. The struggle over terminology mirrors broader struggles for control, power, and self-determination. Going beyond 'food security', the term \"food sovereignty\" originates from La Via Campesina and the predominantly rural small producers movement in the 1990s; it is applied to the urban space by scholars such as Alkon and Mares [ [35](#B35-sustainability-10-02988)] and Block et al. [ [36](#B36-sustainability-10-02988)] as a distinctly political concept that is \"a transformative process ... to recreate the democratic realm and regenerate a diversity of autonomous food systems based on equity, social justice, and ecological sustainability\" [ [36](#B36-sustainability-10-02988)]. Those who use \"food apartheid\" aim to directly implicate the segregation that is reproduced in the modern food system and food movements with respect to who can access healthy, locally produced food along racial lines [ [37](#B37-sustainability-10-02988)]. These scholars foreground issues of race in their analyses in effort to name and dismantle racist legacies in the food system. Food apartheid, according to community organizer and cofounder of the Black Urban Growers organization, Karen Washington, \"brings us to the more important question: 'What are some of the social inequalities that you see, and what are you doing to erase some of the injustices?'\" [ [38](#B38-sustainability-10-02988)]. The term 'apartheid' demands an intersectional approach incorporating race, class, education, geography and the environment. [39](#B39-sustainability-10-02988), [40](#B40-sustainability-10-02988)]), \"alternative food networks\", \"informal food distribution\" and \"short food supply chains\", (a term more commonly used in Europe) in order to track down missing literature from our collection investigating the transfers of food produced in cities. This iterative search process on the distribution side reveals the difficulties in tracking informal food distribution networks, but also the importance of doing so to better understand the real impact of urban agriculture on food insecurity in cities. 3. Food Access: Do Low-Income Urban Consumers Access Urban Produced Food? [33](#B33-sustainability-10-02988)], expanding urban agriculture operations across cities \"does not guarantee that people experiencing food insecurity will access that food...Distribution and access matter\". Food access, closely related to the term food security, constitutes the process of obtaining certain foods (in this case urban-produced) and includes educational, cultural, geographic, and economic dimensions. [27](#B27-sustainability-10-02988), [43](#B43-sustainability-10-02988), [44](#B44-sustainability-10-02988), [45](#B45-sustainability-10-02988), [46](#B46-sustainability-10-02988)]. Other literature studies efforts to bring in fresh food through farmers markets locating in underserved communities, or through offering fresh produce (not necessarily urban produced) in corner stores [ [47](#B47-sustainability-10-02988), [48](#B48-sustainability-10-02988), [49](#B49-sustainability-10-02988)]. Both efforts have met with limited success [ [50](#B50-sustainability-10-02988), [51](#B51-sustainability-10-02988), [52](#B52-sustainability-10-02988)]. Less is known about the actual consumption of urban produced foods by low-income communities. When certain literature reviews (e.g., [ [3](#B3-sustainability-10-02988), [6](#B6-sustainability-10-02988)]) claim that urban agriculture improves food access among food insecure households and communities, it is often from a productivist conceptualization of \"access.\" This productivist focus in the literature conflates existence of urban farms (and thus increase in urban food supply) with increased access, without examining where the food actually goes and who consumes it. [36](#B36-sustainability-10-02988)]. Below we outline barriers to accessing urban produced foods, including physical proximity, cost of food, cost of land, cultural acceptability, and nutrition education, identified from an interdisciplinary body of literature spanning urban agroecology, public health, development economics and food geography. We then describe several successful examples of UA increasing food access, drawing on food sovereignty perspectives, summarized in [Box 1](#sustainability-10-02988-box001). This body of literature stands to benefit from more robust data on actual consumption of urban produced foods, requiring innovative data collection methods and household observations to determine if access (obtaining food) and consumption (eating it) are in fact closely matched. 3.1. Spatial Analyses Highlight Productive Potential and Uneven Distribution of UA [2](#B2-sustainability-10-02988), [18](#B18-sustainability-10-02988), [53](#B53-sustainability-10-02988), [54](#B54-sustainability-10-02988)]. Spatial analyses such as those cited above provide insights into theoretical access, while not addressing the policy, governance and practical barriers that would need to be overcome in order to realize the potential. [55](#B55-sustainability-10-02988), [56](#B56-sustainability-10-02988)]. From a global quantitative mapping analysis done with Google Earth Engine, urban agriculture was found to \"positively influence food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation, and the biological control of pests, services that are worth, as a whole, as much as $160 billion\" [ [53](#B53-sustainability-10-02988)]. This study suggests the ability of urban agriculture to improve food security on a global scale (acknowledging significant country-to-country variability). [18](#B18-sustainability-10-02988)] to 30% of seasonal vegetable demand in Detroit [ [57](#B57-sustainability-10-02988)], to 100% of nutritional needs in Southeastern Minnesota [ [54](#B54-sustainability-10-02988)]. However, very few studies directly quantify how much urban produced food is actually being consumed by low-income food insecure communities, requiring observational and qualitative research methods. Furthermore, these and other studies focus strictly on the productive capacity of UA, while there is much more being produced by UA than food alone (community empowerment, educated food consumers, city green space, etc.), and the products of UA may not perfectly align with existing consumer taste and food purchasing behaviors [ [58](#B58-sustainability-10-02988)]. [2](#B2-sustainability-10-02988)] finds access to urban agriculture and urban-produced foods to be unevenly distributed, and household gardens correlate spatially with patterns of gentrification in Portland [ [59](#B59-sustainability-10-02988)]. In Taylor and Lovell's analysis, they attempt to quantify production and spatial area of urban agriculture using both manual interpretation of high-resolution images and ground-truthing data from walking the city. They find production from residential gardens to be a threefold increase in food production over community gardens, and find both home and community gardens to be highly unevenly distributed: most home gardens are in Chinese and single-family-home neighborhoods, and most community gardens are in the south and west side due to higher land availability, meaning many urban core, low-income census tracts lack access to community or residential gardens. They advocate for better networking of community garden sites to increase access, strategic location of future community gardens among neighborhoods in need, and an emphasis on creating and encouraging home gardens as a key food production strategy available to many city residents. Mack et al. [ [56](#B56-sustainability-10-02988)] find that 68 urban gardens in Phoenix, AZ are currently serving just 8.4% of \"food desert\" residents, and through spatial analysis, 53 gardens sited strategically could serve 96.4% of such residents. From these studies, it is clear that UA projects are not necessarily occurring where they are most needed. [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988)]. The sections below address these other factors influencing access. 3.2. Cost of Urban Produced Foods [60](#B60-sustainability-10-02988)]. Despite claims that vertical farms can \"feed the world in the 21st century\" [ [61](#B61-sustainability-10-02988)], it remains to be seen if vertical farms can address food access and food justice. Such farms are often following a corporate food system model of profit maximization and resource use efficiency, subscribing to capitalist logics rather than alternative, social-justice-oriented practices. Among for-profit farms, \"the few profitable operations tend to be those selling to high-end restaurants and consumers, not to lower-income residents\" [ [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988)]. [62](#B62-sustainability-10-02988)]. Food banks and food pantries fill important \"access gaps\" that urban farms could better supplement or address if cost of urban produced food was made more affordable, or through donations to food banks (as food banks often cite fresh fruits and vegetables as particularly needed donations; [ [62](#B62-sustainability-10-02988)]). [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988)].), and enhance food security through improved healthy food access [ [8](#B8-sustainability-10-02988), [63](#B63-sustainability-10-02988), [64](#B64-sustainability-10-02988), [65](#B65-sustainability-10-02988), [66](#B66-sustainability-10-02988)]. As Kortright and Wakefield [ [63](#B63-sustainability-10-02988)] demonstrate, studies employing qualitative methods are particularly well suited to examine actual impact of urban gardening activities on low-income households. Access via UA participation is certainly enabled when urban farms and gardens are physically proximate to low income neighborhoods, demonstrating the intersection of cost and geography in expanding access. 3.3. Cost of Land and Labor [2](#B2-sustainability-10-02988), [67](#B67-sustainability-10-02988), [68](#B68-sustainability-10-02988), [69](#B69-sustainability-10-02988), [70](#B70-sustainability-10-02988)]. High cost of land prevents community gardens from being established in the urban core in Chicago, leads to hundreds of community gardens in NYC slated for redevelopment annually, and drives gentrification and displacement in neighborhoods around urban farms. Land tenure insecurity directly contributes to lack of access as many urban farms formerly serving minority and immigrant populations have been forcibly closed due to development priorities for privately owned lots (i.e., La Finquita in Philadelphia, PA; South Central Farm serving predominantly Latino households in L.A.; Free Farm in San Francisco; Brooklyn Community Farm in NYC). A recent article on land security indicators among California urban farmers showed that farms with higher land security also had \"more financial and institutional support, and are located in census tracts with higher economic opportunity\" [ [71](#B71-sustainability-10-02988)]. This highlights the necessity of devoting publicly owned lands to urban agriculture in low income and minority neighborhoods, as private lands are highly vulnerable to development pressures, thus jeopardizing any gains realized by social justice oriented urban farms (explored further in [Section 5.2](#sec5dot2-sustainability-10-02988)below). [72](#B72-sustainability-10-02988), [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. This speaks to the \"unattainable trifecta of urban agriculture,\" that is the idea that UA can simultaneously achieve community food security, provide on-the job training and fair living wages, and generate revenue through sales to cover these costs without substantial outside investment [ [72](#B72-sustainability-10-02988)], as well as the tension between farm security and food security [ [74](#B74-sustainability-10-02988), [41](#B41-sustainability-10-02988)], a theme expanded on in [Section 5.1](#sec5dot1-sustainability-10-02988)below reviewing economic viability of urban agriculture. In examples such as City Growers and Higher Ground Farms in Boston, and Dig Deep Farms and Planting Justice in California, organizational efforts to provide jobs and job training lead to marketing of produce to high-end restaurants, retail food establishments, farmers markets, and CSAs at prices unaffordable to food insecure households [ [37](#B37-sustainability-10-02988), [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. 3.4. Culture, Education, and Innovative Urban Food Sources [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988), [35](#B35-sustainability-10-02988), [37](#B37-sustainability-10-02988)]. Access to culturally appropriate foods is known to be an important factor [ [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988), [75](#B75-sustainability-10-02988), [76](#B76-sustainability-10-02988)], yet little is understood about the effects of urban farms growing culturally relevant foods and its relation to food access. More qualitative research is needed on the cultural acceptability of urban produced foods. There is increasing evidence of the importance of culturally relevant educational materials (in multiple languages) around nutrition, food literacy, and culinary skills for improving access and actual consumption of healthy, fresh, urban-produced foods among low income, minority, or immigrant households [ [75](#B75-sustainability-10-02988), [77](#B77-sustainability-10-02988), [78](#B78-sustainability-10-02988)]. Culinary skills and food literacy are becoming focal points of school garden programs (National Farm to School Network), and innovative organizations such as the Green Bronx Machine show how urban agriculture embedded into high-needs schools can directly improve food education, which translates into increased access and consumption [ [79](#B79-sustainability-10-02988)], but additional research is needed to quantify the impact of educational school gardens on community food security. [80](#B80-sustainability-10-02988), [81](#B81-sustainability-10-02988), [82](#B82-sustainability-10-02988)]. From Mien immigrants gathering dandelion bud-shoots in urban parks [ [83](#B83-sustainability-10-02988)], to informal urban foragers helping maintain trees and parks in Seattle, WA ranging in age from 23 to 83 [ [80](#B80-sustainability-10-02988)], to the value of edible weeds [ [84](#B84-sustainability-10-02988)] urban foraging is an activity that recognizes certain agroecosystems as \"commons\" for public access and management (ref. [ [81](#B81-sustainability-10-02988)]; see [Section 5.3](#sec5dot3-sustainability-10-02988)below for a full summary of \"commons\" literature). Urban forest justice scholars \"recognize the rights of local people to have control over their own culturally appropriate wild food and health systems, including access to natural resources and to the decision-making processes affecting them\" [ [80](#B80-sustainability-10-02988)]. The potential to address food insecurity with foraging and gleaning activities is being explored by organizations such as Ample Harvest (national) and The Urban Farmers in Northern California; Ample Harvest's online platform supports over 42 million backyard and community gardeners in ending food waste by channeling excess produce to 1 out of every 4 food banks across the country [ [85](#B85-sustainability-10-02988)]. More research is needed on these innovative forms of urban forestry as a culturally relevant mode of food access. |Diversified revenue streams are key to the success of urban agriculture initiatives providing access to food insecure communities. Additional evidence of success in the literature includes examples of sustained operations over time (allowing sustained access), and evaluations (both internal and external) that demonstrate food access in underserved communities.| |Sustained operations over time: ||Multiple revenue streams: (grants, donations, and in-kind contributions, allows farms to provide a substantial percentage of the food they grow to low-income households, via donations or discounted sales).||Evaluations demonstrating food access:| |These organizations do not rely on produce sales to cover production expenses, but rather cross-subsidize operating expenses and salaries with revenues from grants, donations, educational activities, or other services offered [|[7](#B7-sustainability-10-02988)], the examples above illustrate successful alliances of food justice advocates and local government working to enable sustainable, healthy food access for all urban residents. Through strategic planning and policy design, it may be possible to move beyond ad-hoc successes in linking urban agriculture with food access. The articles reviewed in this section provide a mix of academic studies, theoretical arguments, and policy literature. Additional empirical evidence and longitudinal studies are needed to demonstrate the ability of UA to significantly improve nutrition and food insecurity among urban low-income households over time. Furthermore, consumer preference surveys of urban produced foods are a conspicuous absence in the reviewed access literature. We turn next to food distribution, and the question of how urban produced foods get from the farm to the consumer through various distribution mechanisms. 4. Food Distribution: How Do Urban Farmers Get Their Produce to The Consumer? [16](#B16-sustainability-10-02988)]. As such, very little is understood about where and how urban farmers distribute their food including modes of transportation delivery, either individually or in aggregate, and to whom (retail, institution, anti-hunger programs). It is important to focus on the means through which food produced by different types of farm operations travels from farm to consumer, and the processes through which that food is exchanged (both monetary and nonmonetary), as this directly impacts access and consumption. The scholarly literature as well as media stories describe various modes by which fresh produce is distributed in the city to address fresh food access including both formal (CSA, farm to institution, farm stand, farm to retail, farmers' market) and informal distribution channels (crop swaps, mobile food markets, online food hubs, volunteers taking food home, household production) barriers and challenges farmers face in practice around distributing their produce to those in need while maintaining their operations [ [72](#B72-sustainability-10-02988), [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. None, in our search, focus analysis on distribution flows of urban produced foods across a city. Rather, a more common focus is on which distribution channels are best for getting produce, not necessarily urban produced, into the hands of food insecure households or residents of \"food deserts\" [ [88](#B88-sustainability-10-02988), [90](#B90-sustainability-10-02988)]. Is it a corner store, a large supermarket, or a small local farm stand within a mile radius that such households need in order to access fresh produce? 4.1. Distribution via Corner Stores and Supermarkets [50](#B50-sustainability-10-02988)], but others showing no increase and even resistance from corner store operators who feel that this produce will not sell and therefore become a waste disposal issue [ [50](#B50-sustainability-10-02988), [91](#B91-sustainability-10-02988), [92](#B92-sustainability-10-02988)]. Small neighborhood groceries and mobile markets were found to be promising distribution outlets for expanding access to fresh produce in some Oakland, San Francisco, Erie County NY, and New Orleans communities [ [90](#B90-sustainability-10-02988), [93](#B93-sustainability-10-02988), [94](#B94-sustainability-10-02988), [95](#B95-sustainability-10-02988), [96](#B96-sustainability-10-02988), [97](#B97-sustainability-10-02988)]. However, they are unevenly distributed and conflicting in terms of providing culturally appropriate foods to all minority groups (see [ [90](#B90-sustainability-10-02988)]). In most cases, (a) additional trust and consumer education as well as (b) lower costs and better infrastructure (e.g., refrigeration space) are needed in order to make small groceries and corner stores reliable, accessible, affordable, and sustainable in their operations over the long term. The effects of providing urban produce in neighborhood food retail sites is an area that stands to benefit from additional empirical research. [28](#B28-sustainability-10-02988), [43](#B43-sustainability-10-02988), [46](#B46-sustainability-10-02988), [98](#B98-sustainability-10-02988), [99](#B99-sustainability-10-02988)]. Critical scholarship in the food desert literature finds that revealing food access inequities \"often leads to a public response that focuses on only food stores themselves [or creation of new sites for market transactions], rather than a broader focus upon the inequities in economic investment, political and economic power, and health that the food desert issue highlights\" [ [36](#B36-sustainability-10-02988)]. Innovative distribution efforts for fresh produce, especially urban produced foods, ideally tie in with public education, public health, participatory research, food marketing, and cultural awareness in order to understand and meet the behaviors, preferences, and barriers to purchasing healthy food in at-risk communities. 4.2. Distribution via Farmers Markets [100](#B100-sustainability-10-02988)]. She theorizes the promise and limitations of the \"green economy\" and chronicles the food movement's anti-capitalist roots yet ultimate manifestation as reproducing capitalist inequalities. Lucan et al.'s study of farmers markets in the Bronx took issue with limited hours of operation, seasonality, affordable common produce, and availability of predominantly healthy foods among farmers markets [ [29](#B29-sustainability-10-02988)] compared to nearby stores [ [49](#B49-sustainability-10-02988), [51](#B51-sustainability-10-02988)]. Accepting Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT, or Food Stamps) payments is a basic prerequisite for farmers markets to be considered accessible to low-income consumers, a concept pioneered by the GrowNYC's Greenmarket program [ [101](#B101-sustainability-10-02988)]. While farmers markets in all 50 states now accept food stamps (3200 markets and counting), the price of offerings such as a bunch of kale still exceeds the price of nearby fast food options that may offer a more filling but less nutritious meal option. Some states (including Oregon, Massachusetts, Michigan, California, Washington, Illinois and New York) are moving in the direction of matching EBT funds through various \"market match\" policies, a step towards improving food distribution and access at farmers markets [ [102](#B102-sustainability-10-02988)]. 4.3. Theorizing the Distribution \"Foodshed\" via Alternative Distribution Channels [103](#B103-sustainability-10-02988)]. Foodshed analysis \"provides a way to assess the capacity of regions to feed themselves\" through proximate location of food production, distribution and consumption [ [104](#B104-sustainability-10-02988)]. Applying this concept, Peters et al. [ [40](#B40-sustainability-10-02988)] found that 34% of New York State's total food needs could be met within an average distance of 49 miles, (data skewed by New York City, which depends upon procuring foods from greater distances; most areas of the state were able to rely completely on in-state production). The foodshed, embedded in the local food systems and short food supply chain concepts, is a useful organizing principle for city planners to consider when designing effective food distribution networks, such as the example highlighted in [ [103](#B103-sustainability-10-02988)]: integrating a farm into a housing development project in the South under the title of a \"civic agriculture community\" [ [103](#B103-sustainability-10-02988)], facilitating proximate, affordable distribution channels. This exemplifies planning with a foodshed or systems thinking lens by specifying areas at the neighborhood scale for semi-commercial agriculture, neighborhood CSA, residential kitchen gardens, and residential development in order to build food access and ease of distribution into the neighborhood fabric. [42](#B42-sustainability-10-02988), [105](#B105-sustainability-10-02988), [106](#B106-sustainability-10-02988), [107](#B107-sustainability-10-02988)]. Mobile food distribution options are modeled and shown to increase access in Buffalo, NY, in Widener et al.'s theoretical analysis [ [107](#B107-sustainability-10-02988)]. Agri-hoods have gained increasing mention in local news outlets as a real estate trend in \"Development Supported Agriculture (DSA), and as many as 200 currently exist or are under construction across the country\" [ [106](#B106-sustainability-10-02988)]. They facilitate distribution by co-locating food producers and consumers on strategically planned sites, providing shared infrastructure resources, and making land access affordable for farmers by cross-subsidizing with real estate development. Cooper's report on food hubs in the south, a form of aggregating supply to enable expanded market access, highlights grassroots solutions developed by and for farmers of color, yet \"major challenges [remain] associated with developing and maintaining food hubs within a racial equity framework\" [ [105](#B105-sustainability-10-02988)]. 5. Access and Distribution 5.1. Economic Viability [108](#B108-sustainability-10-02988)] that prevents many operations from meeting all the social and environmental benefits of urban agriculture within a for-profit or capitalist-oriented production scheme. The urban food justice and food sovereignty movements in the U.S. are limited in practice in achieving their more radical or transformative goals due to the fact that they are operating within \"a broader framework of [capitalist] market neoliberalism\" [ [109](#B109-sustainability-10-02988)]. The challenge has not been growing enough food per se, but rather \"producing and distributing food in ways accessible and affordable for the growing urban poor\" [ [109](#B109-sustainability-10-02988)] while sustaining UA operations in a capitalist, production- and profit-oriented society. [72](#B72-sustainability-10-02988)] declare that an urban farm cannot simultaneously (1) provide jobs to vulnerable individuals, (2) provide healthy food to low-income households and (3) generate sustainable income and/or profits from sales. Therefore, what forms of urban agriculture are economically viable in today's political economy? Operations that provide jobs, job training and professional development but sell mostly to high-end consumers (e.g., Planting Justice, Homeless Garden Project, Dig Deep Farms, City Growers), operations that are volunteer-driven or publicly funded (New York City's GreenThumb program or Berkeley Community Gardening Collaborative) and operations that cross-subsidize healthy food donations with revenues generated from other services besides food production (primarily educational) or from crowd-sourced funding (e.g., The Food Project, Urban Adamah, Food Shift Kitchen, Planting Justice) [ [37](#B37-sustainability-10-02988), [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988), [87](#B87-sustainability-10-02988), [110](#B110-sustainability-10-02988)]. |Case Study 1: Growing Power| |Growing Power in Milwaukee, WI, was a leader in the community or \"good food\" movement [|[89](#B89-sustainability-10-02988)]. Allen, who considers farming a form of personal therapy and has always been growing \"more than food,\" continues to grow, now under the for-profit enterprise \"Will Allen's Roadside Farm.\" While now a for-profit business, Allen continues to prioritize serving underserved communities, teaching kids and young people with disabilities, and centering the social impact of his work. While he has said that operating a commercially viable urban farm as a nonprofit \"cannot be done,\" there are others who still maintain that \"a nonprofit, structured properly, or a co-op can be successful in larger-scale urban agriculture projects\" [ [112](#B112-sustainability-10-02988)]. [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. They pride themselves on going beyond \"mere food access\" with their Real Food Hub model, combining TFP's expertise in sustainable agriculture cultivation and youth development with partner organizations' education, family services, and community development expertise to \"give families the tools, skills, and resources to define healthy food options and practices that build physical, social, and cultural well-being\" [ [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. Compared to other \"good food\" organizations in Boston that struggle to provide living wage jobs, speaking to the significant challenges to economic viability that any urban agriculture initiative faces, TFP's \"economic viability and sustainability rest squarely upon its ongoing ability to convince donors (of both money and time) that it is engaging in practices and achieving outcomes that are worthy of their ongoing support\" [ [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. However, the question of wealth transfers across economic class lines (wealthy to lower income), rather than truly reciprocal economic transfers, continues to plague the organization's quest for increased economic equity in the food system at large. Along with many organizations that rely on volunteer and unpaid food work, the question of whether this is non-exploitative and anti-capitalist rests on the nature of the work, degree of choice involved among participants, who can afford the time and ability to volunteer, and ultimate goals of the organization [ [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988), [105](#B105-sustainability-10-02988), [113](#B113-sustainability-10-02988)]. Food hubs are reframed as both tools for provision of market access (enabling economic viability) and self-determination for black farm cooperatives in the South in Cooper's report [ [105](#B105-sustainability-10-02988)] with potential to subvert historic racism and economic marginalization of black farmers. Key to this and other food policy reports in the gray literature is elevating voices and fostering dialogue led by communities of color. [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]. Merging or uniting such AFIs may lead to enclaves outside the traditional capitalist political economy and create new terms of \"economic viability\". 5.2. Policy and Planning Models [114](#B114-sustainability-10-02988)] or \"puzzling omissions\" from American Planning Association resources prior to the early 2000s [ [115](#B115-sustainability-10-02988)], there has been an increase in academic work in the past 10 years dealing with urban food systems planning. In this section we consider the policy landscape of various city and state efforts to incentivize and create space for urban agriculture. Policy is needed to (1) lower costs for low income consumers and urban farmers seeking land, (2) provide strategic location of distribution sites, and (3) encourage year-round produce supply, often enabled by greenhouse systems in urban farms. [33](#B33-sustainability-10-02988)] would argue no; rather, an explicit commitment to food justice and an \"equity lens\" is needed for policymakers and planners to create UA spaces that benefit low income and minority communities equally if not more than already advantaged groups [ [33](#B33-sustainability-10-02988)]. Due to the current landscape of \"disparities in representation, leadership and funding, and insecure land tenure,\" unless these problems are explicitly addressed, \"even the most well-intentioned initiatives will perpetuate or even reinforce the injustices that practitioners and supporters aim to address\" [ [33](#B33-sustainability-10-02988)]. This sentiment is echoed in Morales' chapter in Cultivating Food Justice [ [7](#B7-sustainability-10-02988)], which calls for \"applied research to discover and advance policy objectives related to the antiracist and economic objectives espoused by the Growing Food and Justice Initiative\" [ [111](#B111-sustainability-10-02988)]. This suggests that only by foregrounding issues of race and economic inequality can cities create UA spaces that address food insecurity. [116](#B116-sustainability-10-02988)] find that, in a best-case scenario, the City of Cleveland can achieve almost 100% self-reliance in fresh produce needs, poultry and eggs, and honey, but only with huge amounts of planning support (to devote necessary commercial rooftop space as well as vacant lots to food production). Blum-evitts puts forth a foodshed assessment tool to allow planners to assess local farm capacity in relation to local food needs [ [117](#B117-sustainability-10-02988)]. Theoretical work such as this is important to advance ideas of what is possible and motivate efforts to make change, although it must constantly stay in dialogue with what is happening in practice and expand beyond a production-specific focus on local food systems. Urban farms are, after all, producing a lot more than food, and \"increasing food production in cities does not guarantee that people experiencing food insecurity will access that food\" [ [33](#B33-sustainability-10-02988)]. As such, urban farms can be valued as a secondary food source for large populations, but primary forces for social integration, food-related education, and environmental justice [ [118](#B118-sustainability-10-02988)]. UA is re-valued along a broader spectrum of \"products\" or outputs in [Figure 3](#sustainability-10-02988-f003)below. [119](#B119-sustainability-10-02988)]. Policies such as California's AB 551, the Urban Agriculture Incentive Zone act, have come under criticism for not going far enough to build a just food system, relying on private rather than public spaces to support UA. It is unclear whether incentive zones will be widely adopted by cities and counties in California, and whether they will meaningfully address food access or food sovereignty, especially when the length of time required to devote a piece of land to urban agriculture is only 5 years. In cases where tax incentives are used to promote urban agriculture, primary beneficiaries of the policy are often the privileged class of property owners rather than low-income households or non-property-owning urban farmers. [120](#B120-sustainability-10-02988)], City of Somerville, Detroit, Portland, Madison, Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Milwaukee, Boston, and Chicago. Many policies allow for commercial sales of urban-produced food within the city as \"approved sources\" (food can be sold or donated, e.g., [ [121](#B121-sustainability-10-02988)]); allow for value-added processing and sale of urban produced foods in people's home kitchens (bringing an important revenue generation option to many low-income urban farmers; e.g., California Cottage Food Act); create tax incentives for property owners to convert land into urban farms (e.g., California Urban Agriculture Incentive Zones); amend zoning regulations (e.g., Chicago Urban Agriculture Zoning Amendment); or set up urban beekeeping pilot projects (increasingly part of Google Alerts for UA; see Canada's \"Bee City\" designation or Toronto's \"Pollinator Protection Strategy\" adopted by the city council for relevant policy examples). The Baltimore example is especially noteworthy for its long-term planning approach to structuring urban agriculture into the landscape of the city, with considerations for equity in place. For an extensive review of city urban agriculture policies, see the American Planning Association magazine special issue on The Food Factor [ [122](#B122-sustainability-10-02988)]. [29](#B29-sustainability-10-02988), [30](#B30-sustainability-10-02988), [31](#B31-sustainability-10-02988)], policy and planning has the power to subvert this process by proactively designing policy and zoning ordinances to benefit rather than hurt residents of low-income communities. Another promising policy direction pioneered by the City of Seattle is to dedicate public lands in low-income neighborhoods to UA, which Seattle does through its P-Patch program [ [123](#B123-sustainability-10-02988)]. [124](#B124-sustainability-10-02988)]. [87](#B87-sustainability-10-02988)]. Recognizing this reality and responding to civic activism, NYC public departments and officials have made some efforts (i.e., transfer of properties to the GreenThumb program) to save urban gardens slated for development. NYC provides funding and other support for a variety of urban agriculture initiatives that have strengthened its foundations within the city landscape, from jobs training initiatives (e.g., Farm School NYC and GreenThumb), to community gardens in housing developments (e.g., Via Verde housing development), to school-based greenhouse projects (e.g., NY Sun Works' Greenhouse Project) to commercial farms (e.g., Brooklyn Grange). However, there is room for better coordination across bureaucratic silos; primarily, \"urban agriculture policies should be integrated with affordable housing policies, neighborhood planning and zoning initiatives to more systematically design gardens and farms into new residential developments\" [ [87](#B87-sustainability-10-02988)]. In a policy brief explicitly addressing gentrification, Cohen outlines a series of strategies for resisting displacement: forging alliances with housing organizations, aligning \"just green enough\" and \"just food enough\" strategies [ [125](#B125-sustainability-10-02988)], and civic engagement in negotiating terms for new development projects such as community benefits agreements. [69](#B69-sustainability-10-02988)]) policies with city Climate Action Plans to promote both urban agriculture and alternative food waste management (Composting and anaerobic digestion were found in [ [126](#B126-sustainability-10-02988)] to be the most effective component of reducing urban food systems' Greenhouse gas or GHG emissions) alongside climate benefits; devote public lands to urban farms and gardens in perpetuity; \"retrofit\" affordable housing developments with community gardens (following an affordable home solar installation model); provide public storage, transport, and aggregation options for urban farmers; and convert corner stores into neighborhood groceries offering fresh produce from local farms. Many of these efforts have potential to address many city priorities at once, for example: food access, nutrition and fitness, transportation, community development and crime reduction [ [97](#B97-sustainability-10-02988)]. Providing land access for low-income and minority farmers is an important step towards ensuring a food supply that is culturally appropriate, desirable, and marketable to food insecure urban communities. Strategic public land grants (or land provided by land trusts) have potential to redress historic exclusions of minority farmers from land access, resources, legal expertise, and opportunities for wealth accumulation. By publicly confronting land insecurity and tenure arrangements, policymakers can directly respond to research on UA's uneven development [ [1](#B1-sustainability-10-02988), [25](#B25-sustainability-10-02988), [71](#B71-sustainability-10-02988)]. Overall, there are multifaceted criteria in creating a balanced, equitable city food system (See [ [127](#B127-sustainability-10-02988)] for consideration of justice and sustainability at all scales and the mix of solutions needed for food system reform). 5.3. Civic Engagement and Advocacy [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)]). Existing literature states, \"'participants in a community garden continually express a heightened sense of self-esteem gained from sharing knowledge and skills with each other.' Such community connections can, in some cases, lead towards participation at the larger [policy] level\" [ [36](#B36-sustainability-10-02988)]. By expanding civic engagement into the local policy realm, it is more likely that sites designated, set aside, or incentivized for urban agriculture development will be strategically located, address food insecurity and food justice concerns, and provide long-term access for UA [ [87](#B87-sustainability-10-02988)]. Civic engagement can take many forms, including participating in neighborhood organizations, contacting elected officials and city councilmembers to communicate multiple values of UA, aligning UA with existing city plans/ordinances, or participating in food policy councils. [73](#B73-sustainability-10-02988)] for a discussion of exploitative vs. non-exploitative unpaid work). Civic engagement advances the idea of creating \"public commons\" through urban agriculture, an idea related to ecological economics and explored in David Bollier's book Think Like a Commoner: A Short Introduction to the Life of the Commons. A commons \"integrates economic production, social cooperation, personal participation, and ethical idealism into a single package;\" it is a paradigm of \"self-help and collective gain\" and an \"alternate self-governance structure for resource management and 'living well'\" [ [128](#B128-sustainability-10-02988)]. The commons paradigm espouses a political philosophy grounded in grassroots civic activism, and proposes different \"foundational premises for a new political economy\" based on social connections and rediscovering \"people's knowledge\" of natural systems in their local contexts [ [128](#B128-sustainability-10-02988)]. Simply put, a commons is a resource + a community + a set of social protocols. There is no \"standard formula or blueprint... nor is the commons some panacea or utopia;\" rather it is an evolving model of self-provisioning and local stewardship. [34](#B34-sustainability-10-02988)]. By centering black food geographies, Ram\u00edrez argues such historical traumas can be overturned and re-envisioned, reclaiming urban farm spaces as centers of black liberation.), Who participates, in both policy and urban farming as an activity, is a crucial factor in determining whether outcomes will subvert or reinforce existing power, privilege and structural inequities. As Ram\u00edrez states, \"While recreating neglected urban spaces into 'productive' spaces to grow food is inspiring and beneficial on one level, the prevalence of white bodies inhabiting garden spaces reifies uneven geographies and catalyzes gentrifying forces\" [ [34](#B34-sustainability-10-02988)]. It is the role of inclusive policy processes and watchdog citizen activists to counteract this retrogressive tendency of UA projects. [129](#B129-sustainability-10-02988)]. They were thus motivated to publicize some of that history and provide a means of addressing it directly through their mapping project by supporting \"those who have borne the brunt of labor exploitation, land theft, and discriminatory agricultural policy\" [ [129](#B129-sustainability-10-02988)]. This project has already led to funding for several farmers' projects, as well as land gifts to create several minority-owned farms. While the founders recognize the need to continue litigation and action through formal policy channels, they honor the urgency of needing to \"start right away\" by facilitating \"transfers of wealth.\" They are also contributing to a more updated database of farmers of color, often underrepresented in USDA farm censuses. [130](#B130-sustainability-10-02988)]). This will allow for data to be shared and transferred more easily, and for the network of UA and food justice participants to strengthen through ties to research institutions and each other. Researchers have an important role to play in addressing data gaps and strengthening the network of urban farmers who have clearly identified needs and are ready to work towards appropriate, measurable solutions (see [Table 2](#sustainability-10-02988-t002)for recommendations broken down by actor). Engagement cannot be siloed in individual organizations or projects; it must extend and connect with larger progressive social movements to create policies enabling economic equality. 6. Reframing UA as A Public Good: Using an Equity and Systems Lens to Integrate UA into Municipal Planning and Policy Efforts [72](#B72-sustainability-10-02988)] make a compelling case for building coalitions to provide the necessary political and financial support to fund UA, as well as tackling the \"root causes\" of food insecurity through social services. From what limited studies exist, it seems clear that economic viability of urban farms is largely dependent on income far beyond sales capacity of the urban farm. Public and private investment in UA is necessary to allow urban farms to focus on equity & inclusion rather than sales. Civic engagement elevates UA priorities within city government and has an impact-evidence from New York shows that civic engagement in an advisory capacity to city council meetings holds elected officials accountable and achieves better results when it comes to preserving urban farms threatened by development [ [87](#B87-sustainability-10-02988)]. [33](#B33-sustainability-10-02988)]. Urban agriculture is part of the solutions portfolio to improve food justice and food access, but must be complemented and reinforced by other policy, planning and civic engagement efforts to provide affordable, healthy food through neighborhood groceries, food hubs, cooperative markets, culinary and nutrition education programs, farm to school programs or other means of addressing structural causes of food insecurity (e.g., poverty and job access). Civic engagement from food justice advocates, critical scholarship from multidisciplinary perspectives, and alliances between housing, transportation, and food policy are all necessary components of an urban agriculture landscape that improves access and meets the needs of both producers and consumers. [111](#B111-sustainability-10-02988)]. A food system that advances food justice, access, and economic equality contains many components, among them the opportunity to cultivate and distribute local produce to those lacking adequate nutrition. Thus, urban farms have an important role to play in localized, just food systems.
