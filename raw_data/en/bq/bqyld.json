The University of Southern Mississippi USE OF DIETARY AND HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS IN OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS by Sharon Denise McDonald Abstract of a Dissertation Submitted to the Graduate School of The University of Southern Mississippi in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy May 2015 ii ABSTRACT USE OF DIETARY AND HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS IN OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS by Sharon Denise McDonald May 2015 Over the past several decades, older adults with Osteoarthritis (OA) have increasingly used more natural products in an effort to manage chronic pain. The theoretical framework for this study was the Lazarus and Folkman transact ional theory of stress and coping. This framework was chosen based on the belief that older adults wi th OA are taking natural products as an active problem solving coping strategy to manage the pain, disability, and alterations they experience in their health related qua lity of life including functional status, physical symptoms, emotional health, and social functioni ng. Older adults also take prescription medications for Osteoarthritis and a vari ety of other medical conditions and may not report them to their health care provider, which puts them at a significant risk for drug interactions. The sample of 204 participants diagnosed with OA resided in Southern Mississippi and had visited one of three rheumatology clinics or had participate d in local community activities. The participants completed the questionnaire and returned it by mail. The questionnaire was a consolidation of demographic questions and questions related to the types of natural products and prescription medications taken, visual ana log scale (VAS) for pain, the Pain Disability Index (PDI), and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 Short Form (AIMS2 - SF). iii Data analysis revealed the majority of participants were female s aged 61 to 80 who were White, Non-Hispanic, married and had a High School or GED level of education, and rated their health as being good. Forty-nine per cent of the partici pants reported taking natural products and prescription medications concurrently to relie ve pain. Thirty-five per cent of the participants reported only taking natural product s. Findings indicate participants with higher levels of pain, pain disability, and lowe r HRQOL are continuing to seek treatments to manage their chronic pain, pain disabil ity, and HRQOL. The majority of the participants (65.7%) did not report use to health care providers, underscoring the need for health care providers to question their patients about use of natural products and to educate them on potential adverse side effects with prescription medications.

Conceptual Model of Arthritis and Coping with CAM .........................................16 1 CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used to prevent illness, promote general well-being, treat painful disorders, and supplement conventional medical treatments (AARP & NCCAM, 2011). An increasing number of older adults us e CAM for health promotion, disease prevention, and management of chronic illness. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM, 2013a, para . 3) defines CAM as an array of health care approaches with a history of use or origins outside of mainstream medicine, they are actually hard to define and may mean different things to different people. \"Complementary\" generally refers to using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine. \"Alternative\" refers to using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) found that 44% of older adults aged 50 to 59 reported using CAM in the past 12 months. The NHIS also revealed that 53% of older adults age 50 or above reported using CAM during their lifetime. The interest and use of natural products (dietary, herbal, vitamin, and mineral) suppleme nts has greatly increased in the past few decades. Of all types of CAM therapies , older adults (17.7 %) reported using natural products more than other CAM therapies (NCCAM, 2008). Older adults take prescription medications and over the counter medications t o treat a variety of conditions which puts them at greater risk for drug interac tions and adverse effects. The NHIS revealed 77% of respondents aged 50 and over had used 2 CAM and taken prescription medications, although only 42% of older adults reported it to their physician (AARP & NCCAM, 2011). Failure to report use of supplements is of particular concern because of possible interactions and risk of adverse effect s with prescribed medications (Brownie, 2006; Johnson, 1999). Health care providers define chronic pain as pain lasting past the normal time for healing to have occurred and may last weeks, months, or years (Gureje, Korff, S imon, & Gater, 1998; Tse, Pun, & Benzie, 2005). Back pain and arthritis are common types of chronic pain. Freedman (2002) noted that older adults' most frequent reason to seek medical care is to relieve pain. Patients living with chronic pain experienc e emotional suffering, grief, and loss (Dysvik, Kvaloy, & Furnes, 2013). According to Fre eman (2002), an estimated 9% of the adult population in the United States suffers from noncancerous- related pain. Freedman (2002) also has reported that the prevalence of chronic pain in older adults is 36% to 80%. Chronic pain is one of the most costly and disabling afflictions in the United States. The estimation of financial burden is as high as $100 billion, of which two-thirds is attributed to lost time in work productivity (Miaskowski, 2004). Understanding more about the use of CAM in the older adult population with chronic pain, particularly arthritis pain, is necessary for nurse l eaders to build systems to prevent interactions and integrate safe use of supplements wi th prescription medicine. Arthritis is one of the nation's most prevalent chronic health problems and is a leading cause of disability among adults. It is a chronic progressiv e disease of the joints causing inflammation, stiffness, pain, and limitation of movement and may affect the joints in the hands, knees, hips, and spine (Kee & Epps, 2001; Minor & Sanford, 1999). 3 Arthritis currently affects 50 million American adults (Arthritis Foundat ion, 2012). The prevalence of Arthritis in the 2010-2012 National Health Interview Survey (NH IS) was 29.6% for ages 45 to 64, and increased to 49.4% for ages 65 and above (Blackwell, Lucas, & Clarke, 2014). Individuals living with the chronic pain of arthritis report having a lower health related quality of life (HRQOL) than individuals that do not ha ve arthritis (Khanna et al., 2011). HRQOL is an individual's perception of their own physical and emotional well-being as it relates to their ability to perf orm daily activities and social functions while managing their chronic pain (Cooley, 1998). Individuals living with the chronic pain and disability of arthritis may be using CAM to help r elieve their pain and improve their HRQOL. Problem Statement Chronic Pain Chronic pain is a multidimensional condition with sensory, emotional, and behavioral components contributing to its etiology and severity (McCarberg, 2004). The person often has trouble sleeping, working, or participating in social activitie s. Chronic pain's impact on lifestyle, daily activities, relationships, and financial wel l-being can be overwhelming (Davis & White, 2001). In fact, unrelieved pain has been associated w ith depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, impaired ambulation, increased stre ss, decreased immune response and delayed wound healing (Curtiss, 2001; Ferrell et al., 2002; Freedman, 2002; Kee & Epps, 2001). Common chronic pain complaints include headache, low back pain, cancer pain, and arthritis pain (NINDS, 2007). The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and the European Federati on of IASP Chapters (EFIC) reported osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis ac counts for 4 approximately 40% of chronic non-cancer pain (International Association for the S tudy of Pain and European Federation IASP Chapter [IASP and EFIC], n.d.). Older adults with untreated chronic pain become immobile and must rely on help from others to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Pain, immobility, anxiety, and depr ession lead to social isolation, loss of appetite and malnutrition in the elderly (Battista , n.d.). Arthritis The Arthritis Foundation (2013) defines arthritis as an umbrella term encompassing more than 100 diseases that affect the joints and surrounding tissues. Types of arthritis include but are not limited to osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoi d arthritis (RA), gout, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile arthritis, systemic lupus erythem atosus, scleroderma, and fibromyalgia. Traditionally, clinicians classify joint disease as noninflammatory or inflammatory. Arthritis is an inflammatory joint diseas e. According to McCance and Huether (2006), \"Inflammatory joint disease is characterized b y inflammatory damage in the synovial membrane or articular cartilage a nd systemic symptoms of inflammation\" (p. 1525). One type of arthritis most commonly affecti ng adults as they age is OA. Osteoarthritis is an inflammatory and degener ative joint disease. Osteoarthritis may occur at any age but it occurs most commonly i n people older than age 65 (Arthritis Foundation, n.d.). Pain Disability Joint pain and stiffness result in limited range of motion for people with arthritis and often lead to major disability. More than 7 million adults with arthritis expe rience limitations of daily living such as walking, dressing, or bathing (Arthritis Founda tion, 2012). The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that 43.2% of adults with arthrit is 5 have limitations in activities such as walking, bending, stooping, and kneeling. The CDC (2014) reported medical costs for arthritis was 128 billion dollars and lost earnin gs were 47 billion in 2003. Older adults with arthritis visit their physician more, use more prescription medications, have more hospitalizations, and use services such as transportation, rehabilitation, and meals on wheels significantly more than olde r adults that do not have arthritis. Patients are less able to work, earn less, and are less financially stable which places an economic burden on families. Older adults with arthritis a re more likely to have publicly financed Medicaid and Medicare, Disability and take early retirement due to arthritis pain (National Academy on an Aging Society, 2010). Health Related Quality of Life Individuals living with chronic pain experience physical and psychological difficulties, described as an alteration in health related quality of life (HRQOL). Health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a multidimensional concept defined as t he patient's perception of their health including functional status, physical symptoms, emotiona l health, and social functioning (Cooley, 1998). Individuals with chronic pain reported having a decrease in their HRQOL (Elliott, Renier, & Palcher, 2003). In fact, p eople in chronic pain have a lower HRQOL than individuals with other medical conditions (Fanciullo, Jamison, Chawarski, & Baird, 2001). Adults with arthritis report a lowe r health related quality of life than adults without arthritis (Khanna et al., 2011). Specifically, older adults with OA have poorer HRQOL in all areas (physical health, mental health, sleep, pain management) than those without arthritis (Dominick, Aher n, Gold, & Heller, 2004). The Center for Disease Control (CDC) confirms individuals wit h arthritis have significantly worse HRQOL than individuals without arthrit is. 6 Furthermore, adults with arthritis also report two to four times as many unhea lthy days than individuals without arthritis (CDC, 2014). Older adults' state lack of ability to drive, do housework, and shop alone and lack of money for basic needs negatively effec ts their quality of life (Gabriel & Bowling, 2004). Stress and Pain The theoretical underpinning for this study is Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) transactional framework for stress and coping. Central to this framework i s the premise that individuals use both active (problem solving) and defensive (emotion-focused) coping patterns to manage the demands of stressors that exceed a person's ability t o cope (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). It is imperative that older adults with arthritis c ope with the stressors of the disease because stress exacerbates pain (Curtis, Groar ke, Coughlan, & Gsel, 2004; Melanson & Downe-Wamboldt, 2003). Coping with the stressors associated with arthritis may help reduce pain and improve health related quality of life . The chronic pain of arthritis produces stressors such as loss of function, decreased mobility, and fatigue. Further, those with arthritis have significant continuo us stress that affects the immune system and sympathetic nervous system, which contribute to the physiological stress response (Tsai, Tak, Moore, & Palencia, 2003). The freque ncy and severity of daily stressors related to living with arthritis contributes to i ncreased joint swelling, stiffness, tenderness and fatigue (Crosby, 1988). Individuals with ar thritis must cope with the stress associated with a major chronic illness and the occurrenc e of minor daily stressors. Individuals with arthritis may deal with the pain and stres s of the disease by using active problem-solving strategies that include ingestion of dietary and herbal supplements. 7 Treatment goals for those with arthritis typically include (a) improveme nt in health status (physical, emotional, and social well-being), (b) reduction of stre ss levels, joint pain and inflammation, and (c) restoration or maintenance of function by means of medication, education, prescribed exercise, rest, joint protection, and/or surgery (Hochberg et al., 1995), and complementary and alternative medicine (Fautrel e t al., 2002; Kaboli, Doebbeling, Saag, & Rosenthal, 2001). Patients with chronic pain experience restored function and improved quality of life when they effectively m anage their pain (Curtis, 2001; Ferrell, et al., 2002; Secor, Blumberg, Markow, MacKenzie, & Thrall, 2004). The World Health Organization (WHO) published a guide for the management of chronic pain by health care providers. The WHO protocol advocates use of a pain management ladder. The first step of the ladder begins with administration of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The second step is the addition of opioids for mild to moderate pain. The third step, for persistent pain, is the prescription of opioid analgesics for moderate to serve pain in addition to previous medications from steps one and two (WHO, 2014). Pain management and stress reduction have focused on traditional medications, including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and opioids. Older adults are often sensit ive to opioid analgesics leaving health care providers more reluctant to prescribe anal gesics for fear of side effects or addiction (Culberson et al., 2011; Ferrell et al., 2002; Smi th & Bruckenthal, 2010; Tse et al., 2005), and may recommend CAM therapies, which are widely available, to treat pain. Patients may view herbal and dietary supplem ents as being natural, and they can obtain them without a prescription or approval of their healt h 8 care provider. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medi cine (NCCAM, 2008) reported that approximately 38% of Adults in the United States are using some form of CAM and they are most likely using CAM for musculoskeletal a nd joint pain. The NCCAM's Strategic plan for 2011-2015 outlines the need for further scientific evidence regarding the usefulness of CAM interventions (NCCAM, 2011). One goal of NCCAM is to continue to support research to determine the safety and efficacy of natural products including interactions of supplements and medicati ons. Individuals who delay seeking care from conventional medicine practitioners are more likely to use CAM (Ayers & Kronenfeld, 2012). Types of CAM The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM , 2008) has identified many types of CAM: Natural Products, Mind and Body Medicine, Manipulative and Body-Based Practices, and Other CAM therapies. Herbal and di etary supplements are types of Natural Products, which is the focus of this study. Table 1 displays the NCCAM Classifications of CAM.

Dietary supplements most often used by people with OA, include glucosamine and chondroitin, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) (NCC AM, 2014). Two comprehensive research reviews discussing the use of herbal therapy in arthritis were located in the Cochrane Library (Little, Parsons, & L ogan, 2009; Cameron, Gagnier, & Chrubasik, 2011). These reviews reported the use of specific herbs used i n patients with arthritis. Twenty-two studies of patients with RA that used herbs, a nd five studies of patients with OA that used herbs were reviewed. Of the 27 studies evaluat ed, nine included adults less than age 50 yrs. old. The remaining 18 studies reported use of herbs in older adults age 50 years and above. None of the studies reported HRQOL. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of natural products (herbal and dieta ry supplements) in older adults with OA and determine impact on pain and HRQOL. Natural Products and Prescription Medications Patients taking both herbal or dietary supplements and prescription medications are in danger of experiencing an adverse drug-drug interaction (Brownie, 2006). T he Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider herbal supplements as medications so they are not required to approve them as being safe or effective for consumers (United States National Library of Medicine [NLM], 2013). The vari ous manufacturers of herbal supplements are not required to follow uniform guidelines for producing supplements. Health care providers and consumers should question the safety 11 and purity of herbal supplements (NCCAM, 2014). In a national telephone survey conducted in 1997 of 2055 adults of which 68% were 35 years or older, only 377 (38.5%) of the survey respondents in the study who used one or more alternative therapies stated they had informed their health care provider of their use (Eis enberg et al., 1998). A telephone survey of over 1000 people aged 50 and older conducted in 2010 by AARP and NCCAM revealed more than half of the participants reported using CAM a nd had not reported use to their health care provider. More than a third of the participants reported taking a dietary or herbal supplement and had not reported use to their healt h care provider. These findings underscore the need for health care providers to a sk their patients about the use of CAM at every visit and the importance of older adults reporti ng CAM use to their health care provider (AARP & NCCAM, 2011). Health care provi ders must be aware of the use of supplements to monitor for adverse effects (NCCAM , 2011). Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine if older adults aged 40 and above with OA (a) use natural products and prescription medications either alone or concurre ntly to manage chronic pain; (b) self- report if the use of the natural products (dietary and herbal supplements) decreases pain and pain disability; (c) had higher health relate d quality of life if they used natural products than those who did not use natural products; and (d) report the use of natural products, if they used them, to their health care providers. Research Questions The research questions for this descriptive comparative study are: 1. What are the specific types of natural products (dietary and herbal supplement s) and prescription medications that older adults with OA take? 12 2. Is there a difference in pain between 4 groups of patients with OA (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products)? 3. Is there a difference in pain disability between 4 groups of patients with OA (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products)? 4. Is there a difference in health related quality of life between 4 groups of pa tients with OA (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products)? 5. Are there differences by the 4 groups (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products) on demographics? 6. Do the individuals with OA that are taking natural products (dietary and herbal supplements) concurrently with prescription medications report the use of natural products to the health care provider? Definition of Terms The terms defined for this study are older adults with arthritis, chronic pain disability, health related quality of life, and natural products. Older Adults with Arthritis is defined as adults aged 40 or over diagnosed with osteoarthritis. For the purpose of this study, older adults with arthritis will be operationalized by participants self-report of age, type of arthritis, a nd length of time with arthritis from less than one year to greater than 40 years as reported on t he demographic portion of the questionnaire. 13 Chronic Pain Disability is defined as a persistent, recurring, unpleasant discomfort the individual describes as interrupting activities of daily life re sulting in physical and emotional disability for 6 months or longer. For the purpose of this stud y, pain will be operationalized by the participant's self-reported rating of the ir chronic pain on the Visual Analog Scale (0 to 10). Disability will be operationalized by the pati ent's self-reported disability using the Pain Disability Index (summed scores of the degree pain interferes with seven life activities) (family and home responsibiliti es, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and life support activity). Health Related Quality of Life is defined as the physical, psychological, and social domains of health that influences a person's perceptions of their health and their experiences. For the purpose of this study, HRQOL will be operationalized by the participants self-report using the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scal e 2 -Short Form (AIMS2- SF) self-report of the individual's (physical functioning, symptoms , social interaction, role functioning, affect, and perception of overall health). Natural products are defined as herbal and/or dietary supplements utilized by individuals to relieve pain. For the purpose of this study, natural products will be the participants self-report of the types of supplements they are taking on the dem ographic portion of the questionnaire. Assumptions 1. The participants with arthritis desire relief of pain. 2. The participants with arthritis desire improved health-related quality of life. 3. The participants with arthritis are able to answer questions regarding thei r use of natural products and their functional abilities. 14 4. The participants with arthritis will self-report answers to questions hone stly and accurately. Theoretical Framework The researcher is using Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) transactional model of stress and coping as the theoretical framework for this study. Lazarus and Folkman defined psychological stress as \"a particular relationship between the pe rson and the environment that is appraised by the person as taxing or exceeding his or her resour ces and endangering his or her well-being\" (p. 19). Chronic pain, loss of functional ability, financial concerns, and lack of interaction with family and friends, and fatigue experienced by people with arthritis leads to depression, decreased satisfa ction in life, which in turn can be physically manifested by further exacerbations of pain (Tak, 2006) . According to Lazarus and Folkman, people must cognitively evaluate or appra ise their situation in order to determine that stress is present. A person's evaluation or appr aisal of their stressful situation is the primary and secondary appraisal. A person eva luating the significance or meaning of an event is conducting a primary appraisal. If t he person feels threatened or challenged by the event, the person then evaluates what they might or can do, which is the secondary appraisal. The authors then defined coping as a \"cognitive and behavioral effort to manage specific external and/or internal demands\" (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, p. 141). The forms of coping identified are emotion-focused and problem-focused coping. Emotion- focused coping strategies such as avoidance, putting aside thoughts about the event for a time, meditating, exercise, venting anger, and seeking emotional support are an individual's effort to lessen their emotional distress. Problem-focused coping st rategies 15 center on efforts to alleviate the problem causing the stress. A person's abil ity to cope with situations depends on their \"health and energy, beliefs, problem-solving skills, s ocial skills, social support and material resources\" (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, p.179). Laz arus and Folkman further noted that the importance of appraisal and coping is to effect adaptational outcomes. The three adaptive outcomes are: (a) functioning in work and social living, (b) morale or life satisfaction, and (c) somatic health. Fundam ental to this study is the belief that older adults with unacceptable levels of pain from arthrit is will use both problem and emotion-focused coping strategies including using CAM as a means of reducing pain and pain disability. The individual in chronic pain experiences an increase in psychological stress. The individual must cognitively evaluate their situation referred to as primary appraisal; and, if threatened, evaluates an action they can take which is referred to as sec ondary appraisal. The decision to cope with the stress of the illness and other stressors l eads the individual to choose emotion-focused strategies and/or problem- focused strategies to deal with the stress. The decision to use CAM is a problem- focused strategy. The desired outcome is to decrease pain and to improve health related quality of life. T he conceptual model for this study is based on Lazarus and Folkman 's Transactional theory of stress and coping shown in Figure 1. Arthritis and Coping Model Significance The increasing use of herbal and dietary supplement s to relieve pain may have a serious or life- threatening consequence for those with of CAM in older adults with arthritis is virtually unstudied. The lack of scientific evidence is a concern given the fact that usage of supplements may be harmful. and dietary supplements are readily available a the health care providers' knowledge. Herbal or di etary supplements taken with prescription medications may result in bleeding, ca rdiac instability, hypoglycemia, and immunosuppression (Brownie, 2006; Capriotti, 2 and their health care providers may be unaware of t he safety concerns and the potential for adverse effects of natural products. Researche rs need to conduct more studies FiFFFig Figure 1. Conceptual Model of Arthritis and Coping with CAM Arthritis and Coping Model The increasing use of herbal and dietary supplement s to relieve pain may have a threatening consequence for those with arthritis (Brownie, 2006).

The lack of scientific evidence is a concern given the fact that usage of supplements may be harmful. and dietary supplements are readily available a nd patients often taken take them without the health care providers' knowledge. Herbal or di etary supplements taken with prescription medications may result in bleeding, ca rdiac instability, hypoglycemia, and immunosuppression (Brownie, 2006; Capriotti, 2 004; Ernst, 2000). Arthritis sufferers and their health care providers may be unaware of t he safety concerns and the potential for adverse effects of natural products. Researche rs need to conduct more studies Conceptual Model of Arthritis and Coping with CAM 16 The increasing use of herbal and dietary supplement s to relieve pain may have a arthritis (Brownie, 2006).

Herbal take them without the health care providers' knowledge. Herbal or di etary supplements taken with prescription medications may result in bleeding, ca rdiac instability, hypoglycemia, and Arthritis sufferers and their health care providers may be unaware of t he safety concerns and the potential for adverse effects of natural products. Researche rs need to conduct more studies 17 examining the prevalence of use and specific types of supplements taken by older adults (Ananthanarayan & Urbach, 2000; Cheung, Wyman, & Halcon, 2007; Ernst, 2000; Gleeson, Lancaster, & Bishop, 2001). The National Institute of Health (NIH) more recently convened an expert panel in April of 2013 to determine the future direction of research for CAM modalities inc luding natural products. The panel reported a need for researchers to continue to investigat e the prevalence and patterns of use by specific populations such as those with chronic conditions to help establish which products have the highest priority for research int o the safety and efficacy of natural products to promote general health (NIH, 2013) . 18 CHAPTER II REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE Introduction This literature review illustrates research findings about adults with arthritis, and the related concepts in this study: stress, coping, and health related qualit y of life and the use of complementary and alternative medicines. The researcher conducted an e xtensive search of the empirical literature using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Pub Med, and Cochrane electronic databases. The search was limited to English-language reports. Currently, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has 223 arthritis and CAM citations; 31 arthritis and herbal suppl ement citations; 469 arthritis and dietary supplement citations; 415 arthritis and HRQO L citations but only 15 citations of arthritis, CAM , and HRQL. Initially, a search was conducted using the key words arthritis, complementary and alternative medicine, osteoarthritis, health related quality of life, coping, and stress . The researcher conducted subsequent searches using the key words herbs and dietary supplements. Additional searches were conducted using OA combined with the type of herbal or dietary modality. Lastly, searches were conducted using the key words arthritis and specific herbal or dietary supplements associated with pain, inflammation a nd pain relief: Reumalex, Gamma-linolenic acid, Fever Few, Triptergium F, Saw Palmetto, Green Tea, Flaxseed oil, Ginkgo, Ginger, Ginseng, Thunder god vine, Boswellia and Valerian. 19 CAM Use in Arthritis Studies were included for review if they focused on adults diagnosed with any type of arthritis and used CAM treatments. Seventeen of the studies focused on the prevalence of CAM use in those with arthritis, the effectiveness of specific CAM modalities and the patient's beliefs concerning CAM therapies. Six resear chers discussed the use of various CAM modalities other than natural products, which the researcher excluded from the review. The researcher identified 12 studies regarding preva lence of CAM use, particularly natural products and beliefs about CAM presented in Table 2. 20 Table 2 Studies of CAM use in Adults with Arthritis Author(s)/Date of Publication Focus of Study Design, Sample, Data Collection Method Types of CAM Used General Findings Hoerster et al.

The prevalence of arthritis for adults residing i n Mississippi is 647,000 adults or 31% of the adult population (Center for Disease Control [CDC], 2011). Many researchers have conducted studies on patients with OA but fe w of these studies have included the use of herbal and dietary supplements as a complementary or alternative treatment. Yet, conventional medicine does not a lways relieve the pain these individuals suffer, leaving them to search for alte rnative pain relief methods. Since the 1990's there has been an increase of people seeking use of alternat ive therapies to help them cope with their chronic pain (Breen, 2002). Arthritis and Stress Older adults with arthritis experience both physiological and psychologica l stress related to managing their disease symptoms. Mahat (1997) revealed that the pri mary stressors to individuals with arthritis were pain, limited mobility, and diffic ulty with activities of daily living, disruption of relationships, dependency, and restrict ed life-style. This descriptive comparative study of 53 older adults with arthritis set the gr oundwork for other studies that followed. Several other researchers reached similar findings identifying stressors to those that live with arthritis (Melanson & D owne-Wamboldt, 2003; Tak, 2006). Melanson and Downe-Wamboldt conducted a descriptive longitudinal study of 48 older adults aged 60 years or greater with arthritis since midl ife. Researchers interviewed participants at 6-month intervals for one year using the Jal owiec's, Coping Scale. The participants stated loss of functional ability, chronic pain, decrea sed mobility, decreased energy, and fatigue were stressors for them, and in addition, these pa rticipants 27 reported uncertainty and troubled marriages as stressors. A qualitative et hnographic study by Tak (2006) revealed similar findings, but also identified financial pr oblems, lack of social relationships, family difficulties and living conditions as additional sour ces of stress. The chronic pain of arthritis may lead to psychological distress manifest ed as depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance (Freedman, 2002). Two studies supported the theory that those with higher pain disability also had increased psychological dis tress (James, Miller, Brown, & Weaver, 2005; Tak & Laffrey, 2003). James et al., exam ined the degree to which pain disability interferes with activities of daily li ving in older people with arthritis (2005). The descriptive cross-sectional research study incl uded 141 people aged 50 years or older diagnosed with arthritis. The researchers used the Pai n Disability Index, (PDI), Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS), and the Ar thritis Self Efficacy Scale (ASES) in their study. The researchers found that partic ipants with high pain disability also had increased psychological distress (James et al ., 2005). A descriptive correlational study with similar findings by Tak and Laffre y (2003) contained 107 participants aged 60 years or older diagnosed with arthritis. Researcher s collected data using the AIMS, Chronic Daily Stress for Elderly Scale (CDSES), Ja lowiec Coping Scale, Health Locus of Control, and Life Satisfaction Index questionnaires . The researchers concluded that those participants reporting a higher pain disabilit y also had increased levels of psychological distress (Tak & Laffrey, 2003). The daily stress experienced by people with arthritis depresses their i mmune system and exacerbates their condition (Crosby 1988; Curtis, Groarke, Coughl an, & Gsel, 2004; Tak, 2006). Hans Seyle (1952) developed a theory of adaptation to biological 28 stress that he named the General Adaptation Syndrome. The exposure to prolonged stre ss activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system (HPA). The the anterior pituitary to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex t o produce glucocorticoids, primarily cortisol. Prolonged or excessive producti on of ACTH is associated with depression, decreased immune response, infections, and tumors. Se yle proposed disorders, such as arthritis, are one of several diseases related to m aladaptation to stress. Psychological distress also affects the immune system by increasing cytokines that increase inflammation (Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glas er 2002). Crosby (1988) explored the effects of stress on the immune system by conducting a study of 101 adults aged 18 to 75 years to determine the relationship between stre ss factors, emotional stress, and arthritis. Crosby found a significant rela tionship between emotional stress and disease activity stating excessive emotional stre ss initiated release of catecholamine and cortisol that are damaging to the immune system. The harmf ul effect of stressors exacerbates disease activity and depresses the immune sy stem. It is imperative for individuals with arthritis to find strategies to reduce or eli minate their pain and immobility (Crosby, 1988). Arthritis and Coping Individuals with the chronic pain and stress of arthritis must cope with the pain and immobility associated with their disease. A person's ability to cope wi th stressors can influence their adaptation to their illness (Curtis et al., 2004; Mahat, 1997; Tsai et al., 2003). Five studies in the literature reported problem solving coping strategi es reduced pain and depression in participants with arthritis (Curtis et al., 2004; Mahat, 1997; 29 Melanson & Downe-Wamboldt, Tsai et al., 2003). Mahat's (1997) descriptive correlational study of 53 participants with arthritis aged 65 or older found that the use of problem solving coping strategies reduced pain, anxiety, and depression in the participants. Curtis et al. (2004) in a longitudinal study exami ned the impact of psychological stress, social support, and coping on 52 individuals' adjustment to having arthritis. Participants completed a two-hour semi-structured inter view. Researchers used the Perceived Stress Scale, COPE Social Support Survey and the AIMS instruments to collect data. The researchers found that individuals who used problem solving coping had less psychological distress and depression than those who did not use problem solving coping. Similarly, Downe-Wamboldt and Melanson (1998) conducted a descriptive longitudinal study to test a model of relationships between socioeconomic status (SES), gender, severity of impairment, stress, emotions, coping strategies, and psyc hological well-being in individuals with arthritis. Researchers interviewed seve nty-eight participants aged 60 years or older in their home and re-interviewed them again 12 months later. The researchers used The AIMS, Index of Social Status, and St ress questionnaire, Jalowiec Coping Scale and the Mental Health Inventory to collec t data. Data analyses included path analysis and a repeated measure ANOVA to test for changes over time among the variables. The results showed SES influenced coping strateg ies and well-being and that the degree of severity of impairment affected emot ional well-being. Optimistic and self-reliant coping strategies were the most frequently used coping strategies by the elderly to manage the stress associated with arthrit is. Additional studies also support the findings that an individual's ability to cope with chronic pain influe nces 30 health status (Tsai et al., 2003). Tsai and colleagues employed secondary anal ysis of an original study to test a middle range theory of chronic pain. The original stud y was a descriptive, correlational design that examined relationships among functional disability, chronic daily stress, social support, and depression in older adults with arthritis. I n the original study, seventy - one older adults age 60 years or older and diagnosed with arthritis longer than one year participated in the study. Participants compl eted the AIMS questionnaire, Personal Resource questionnaire, Elderly Daily Stress Sca le and the CESD Depression Scale. Researchers used path analysis to test the hypothesize d model and multiple regression to create the path model. The researchers reported usin g Chi-square and other goodness-of-fit indices in their study. Statistical analysis of t he Chi-square and goodness-of-fit values indicated a good fit between the model and the data. The researchers found participants used problem-focused strategies to moderate the relationship between daily stress and health status. Coping skills, particul arly problem- focused coping impacted health status of the participants. Tak and Laffrey (2003) bel ieve people can manage their stress by using emotion- focused and problem solving st rategies to deal with stressful events. Lastly, a study of stressors and coping strategies by Melanson and Down e- Wamboldt (2003) identified physical limitations and pain as stressors in people wi th arthritis. Adding to previous findings in the literature, the authors discussed types of problem solving strategies identified by participants. The researchers stated the participants' decision to use rest or take medications to manage symptoms was a problem- solving coping strategy. 31 Health Related Quality of Life Several studies have used health related quality of life (HRQOL) measure ments with various disorders such as with gastrointestinal bleeding (Sousa & Will & Fridlund, 2003; Cooley, 1998) and chronic pain in general (Elliott et al., 2003; Fanciullo et al., 2001; Secor et al., 2004). Although many studies have been conducted with arthritis and HRQOL, only four studies have been located concerning arthritis, use of natural products and HRQOL & Eaton, 2012). Findings of previous research of non-arthritic pain confirm that people in chronic pain have a lower HRQOL than individuals with other medical conditions (Elliott et al., 2003; Fanciullo et al., 2001). Fanciullo et al. (2001) used a software program to assess 20 categories of qua lity of life and administered the tool to 103 adults (53 males and 50 females) aged 18 years or older with various types of chronic pain. Researchers classified patie nts in the study as having spinal, neuropathic, somatic, and chronic pain. Researchers classifie d patients with vertebral pain as spinal pain. Researchers classified patients with ne uralgia and neuropathy as neuropathic pain. Researchers classified patients with osteoar thritis, sprains, strains, osteoporosis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and arthropathies a s having somatic pain. Lastly, researchers classified patients wit h fibromyalgia, phantom pain, arthritis, and lupus as having chronic pain. Results showed patients with chronic pain have consistently lower ratings of perceived QOL than patients that do not ha ve chronic pain (Fanciullo et al., 2001). 32 A study by Secor et al., (2004) examined the use of CAM in relation to pain and quality of life. The researchers conducted a prospective study of 94 subjects at an urban- based Holistic Wellness Center in Connecticut. The participants were exper iencing various types of spinal pain including Cervicalgia, Lumbago, Sciatica, mus cle spasms, and fatigue. The researchers used the SF-12 Health Survey to measure HRQOL a nd the Numeric Pain Analog Scale to measure pain. Participants reported they used acupuncture, chiropractic, and naturopathy treatments. There was a significa nt reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life in the participants (Secor et al., 2004). Another study by (Elliott et al., 2003) examined the use of the Short Form-36 (SF- 36) to measure chronic pain, depression, and quality of life. Researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey of 242 individuals with chronic pain using the SF-36. The stud y participants were 160 women and 82 men whose mean age was 46 years. Researcher s identified patients with all types of diagnoses and chronic pain in their study. The researchers examined the type of pain, level of pain, medical diagnoses, and pati ent demographics of participants. All individuals in chronic pain had a very low SF-36 score. The researchers concluded that the SF-36 might be a useful clinical tool to measure health-related quality of life in people with chronic pain (Elliott et al., 2003) Researchers conducted a similar study to describe and compare HRQOL in two groups of people with cancer (Bostrom et al., 2003). Researchers used the SF-36 to evaluate HRQOL and pain intensity levels in 47 patients. Individuals had low scores of the SF-36 dimensions of physical functioning, physical and bodily pain. There were statistically significant positive correlations between pain items and ne gative correlations 33 between pain and the SF-36 dimensions. The researchers concluded that pain has a negative impact on HRQOL, especially on physical health (Bostrom et al., 2003). The following two studies investigated the use of CAM and HRQOL in patients with arthritis. The first study by (Hunnicutt et al., 2008) explored the use of CA M and HRQOL in patients with Scleroderma. Researchers interviewed patients e nrolled in the Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcomes Study (GENISOS) in South Texas over a two-year time. The researchers placed nineteen patients in t he CAM User group and seventeen patients into the non-CAM user group. Researchers used the SF-36 to assess perceived functioning. The researchers reported the most frequent C AM modalities used were mineral supplements (44%), large doses of vitamins (39.9%) and herbal therapies (39.9%). Patients stated they used CAM to treat pain (N = 12) and arthritis/ arthralgia (N = 11) symptoms. The researchers concluded that at year 2 the CAM user group had significantly higher scores in perceived mental and physical functioning than the non-CAM user group. The second study by Lapane et al., (2012) examined the use of CAM among patients with OA of the knee. The researchers interviewed 2,679 participants of the Osteoarthritis Initiative. They asked participants if they used any of t he CAM therapies in the past 30 days and in the past six months. Researchers placed participants into four groups (conventional medication users only, CAM users only; users of both and; users of neither). Researchers used the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 (SF-12) to assess general physical health status and the Knee Outcomes Osteoarthritis Surve y (KOOS) as an indicator of quality of life. Biologically based supplements were the most often used method of CAM (68%). The researchers reported that participants with higher scor es on 34 the SF-12 (physical summary) and the KOOS-QOL were less likely to rece ive any treatments. The researcher has identified few studies of HRQOL and us e of natural products by older adults with OA. This study will add to the body of knowledge about health related quality of life and the use of natural products in individuals with O A. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research involving the many types of CAM to treat various types of arthriti s is extensive. Few studies have specifically targeted the use of natural products (herbal and dietary supplements) in OA as a problem solving coping strategy to decrease pain and improve HRQOL. People may try different types of CAM to treat their arthrit is although researchers have determined many types of CAM have little to no benefit a nd may have serious side effects (NCCAM, 2013b). Cherniack et al., (2001) reported researche rs have not conducted many studies on the use of CAM by the elderly. Cherniack and colleagu es (2001) conducted a cross-sectional survey in two urban populations of older adults to examine the patterns of use of complementary therapies. Researchers interv iewed a convenience sample of 423 older adults in New York City. Researchers questioned individuals regarding their intake of vitamins, minerals, herbal medicines and supplements as well as other alternative treatments such as massage, ac upuncture, biofeedback, and spiritual healing. Researchers found that 72.2% of the participants use d complementary and alternative medicine. Females with a higher education wer e most likely to use CAM. The researchers found a higher prevalence of CAM use compared t o previous reports in large national surveys. Arthritis was a common reason for use of CAM in the participants. A limitation to the study was the use of a convenience sam ple of older ambulatory adults in an ethnically and diverse area rather than a random sample. 35 The researcher may not be able to generalize the results to older adults a cross more homogenous populations across the nation. Prevalence of CAM Use Twelve of the studies reviewed reported the prevalence of CAM use (Chandola, Young, McAlister, & Axford,1999; Cherniack, Senzel, & Hoerster, Butler, Rolinak et al., 2005) . These studies reported wide variations in utilization rates (29% to 90%) and types of CAM usage. In genera l, White adults with arthritis used CAM more frequently than Blacks, Mexican Ameri cans, and Chinese Americans (Kronenberg et al., 2006; Mikuls et al., 2003). Two studies reported prevalence of CAM use among people exclusively with arthritis (Herman e t al., 2004; Rao et al., 1999). In both studies, patients with arthritis used CAM more than patients who did not have arthritis (Herman et al., 2004; Rao et al., 1999). The researcher examined 12 prevalence studies. Of the 12 prevalence studies, five included dietary supplements. Rates of use for dietary supplements such as Glucosamine and Chondroitin ranged from 4 % to 97% (Herman et al., 2004; Mikhail et al., 2004; Mikuls et al., 2003; Rao et al., 1999; Rolniak et al., 2004). Seven of the studies reported the use of herbal supplements such as Garlic, Ginger, Valerian root, Aloe Vera, Mint, Chamomile, and Cat's Claw ranging from 4.2 % to 93% (Herman et al., 2004; Kaboli et al., 2001; Kronenberg et al., 2006; Lewis et al., 2001; Mikhail et al., 2004; Rao et al., 1999; Rolniak et al., 2004). 36 Beliefs about CAM Two studies explored patient beliefs regarding utilization of CAM (Figaro et a l., 2004; Lewis et al., 2001). In both studies, CAM in the form of natural remedies was preferred over traditional treatments such as surgery or prescription medici nes. Additionally, in the Lewis and colleagues study (2001) participants felt that 'na tural home remedies' were a better fit for treatment of their arthritis. Herbal Supplements Of all the CAM modalities studied, researchers have conducted the least amount of studies on adults with arthritis use of herbal and dietary supplements (Haynes , Taylor, & Snow, 1979) (Table 3). Scholars can trace the use of herbs back 2400 years to the Greek physician Hippocrates. The use parts of plants as a medicine to treat me dical conditions is also termed botanical medicine, phytotherapy, or phytomedicine. Her bs are used to treat various minor cuts and wounds MIMS Consumer Health Group, 2006). Many cultures around the world have used herbs for centuries. Even today, Chinese, Eastern Indian, and Amazonian medicine systems rely heavily on he rbs to preserve health and promote healing (Ahmed, Anuntiyo, Malemud, & Haqqi, 2005). Ancient Chinese herbalists were aware of the potential benefit of traditi onal treatments such as herbs, acupuncture, massage, and diet to improve health. They were able t o perceive a person's health imbalance and used their senses to decide the technique or herbs to use to correct the imbalance. Early in the Chinese civilization, Shamans relied on herbs as part of their healing practices. The first written descriptions of herbs and their use was the Classic of the Materia Medica, written during the Han D ynasty. This organized text did not use any references to Shamans and described only the physical 37 actions of herbs and their effects on the individual's sensations and symptoms (Wicke , 1998). Herbalists may use herbs derived from any part of a plant to promote heali ng. The manufacturers of prescription drugs originally derived components from tree s, shrubs, or herbs. Several cultures have used herbs as medicine to foster healing. Native Am erican, Roman, Egyptian, Persian, and Hebrew cultures have written records that show t hey used herbs to cure practically every known illness. Humans have spread the use of herbs as medicine throughout the world from country to country by use of travel and trade (M IMS Consumer Health Group, 2006). Most Western countries including the United States categorize herbal supplements as an alternative or complementary therapy. Herbal supplements re main the primary form of medicine widely available to most of the world's population. There a re an estimated 400,000 plants known today, but only a very small percentage of these have been studied or used medicinally. Many researchers believe that there are p lants yet unrecognized for their healing powers. (MIMS Consumer Health Group, 2006). Herbalists treat people with many chronic conditions including those with skin, hear t, digestion, and arthritic problems (MIMS Consumer Health Group, 2006). People try many different types of CAM for arthritis (National Center for Complem entary and Alternative Medicine, 2008). Several studies have found the use of herbal supplement s to be beneficial to those with arthritis in specific instances (Buckwalter, C allaghan, & Rosier, 2001; Darlington & Stone, 2001; Pinn, 2001). 38 Dietary Supplements Dietary supplements contain herbs, vitamins, minerals and other botanicals to supplement the diet (NCCAM, 2008). According to the 2007, National Health Interview Survey of 23,393 adults aged 18 years and older 17.7 % have used a natural product supplement in the past year (NCCAM, 2008). People take dietary supplements for ma ny health reasons, including to prevent colds, increase energy, and prevent osteoporos is, supplement dietary intake or to improve overall health. These supplements do not require a prescription or a doctor's visit and are readily available to consumers over the counter in grocery stores, discount stores, drug stores, and on the Internet (NCCAM, 2008). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the regulation of medications including dietary and herbal supplements. The FDA does not consider dietary and herbal supplements as medications so they do not hold them to the same stringent manufacturi ng guidelines and safety testing as other medications undergo. The FDA considers dietary supplements as a category of foods (NCCAM, 2008). Congress established the Die tary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) in 1994 to help regulate supplements. The manufacturers of dietary supplements are responsible for making sure the supplements they are providing to consumers is safe according to the DSHEA. The FDA may take action against any manufacturer that provides unsafe supplements only after it is available to consumers. The FDA does not have to approve dietary supplements before manufacturers sell them to the public. Health care providers and consumers must be aware of safety concerns (NCCAM, 2008). The researcher identified studies that named specific herbal or dietary supplements used by or administered to individuals with arthritis. The researc her 39 reviewed studies published in English with humans. See previous list of search engine s used earlier in this Literature Review. The researcher evaluated el even studies of herbal or dietary supplements utilized in adults with arthritis. The researcher ex cluded articles regarding an experimental design examining effectiveness of supplement s. This study includes summaries of three studies using descriptive designs regarding prevalence, types of supplements utilized and major findings in Table 2. Further, there is evidence to suggest that those with arthritis used more supplements than those without arthriti s (Quandt et al., 2005) 40 Table 3 Studies of Herbal and Dietary Supplements Used in Arthritis Author(s)/Date of Publication Focus of Study Design, Sample, Data Collection Method Types of CAM Used General Findings Brownie (2006) Identify health conditions and symptoms that predict use of herbal supplements and evaluate potential risks associated with use of supplements Descriptive design; N = 1263 participants random sample aged 65 to 98 years; 51% male, 49% female; residing in Australia; completed mailed surveys Glucosamine and fish oil Having arthritis predicted use of supplements; 43% of all participants used supplements Quandt et al (2005) Investigate the prevalence of supplement use by persons who report being told by a doctor they had arthritis Descriptive design; N = 106,000 randomly selected participants aged 45 years and older; N= 1,902 males with arthritis; 3,698 females with arthritis; secondary analysis data from the 2002 National Institute of Health Survey Nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products, megavitamins Use of supplements were higher for persons with arthritis than for persons without arthritis 41 Table 3 (continued). Author(s)/Date of Publication Focus of Study Design, Sample, Data Collection Method Types of CAM Used General Findings Rao et al (1999) To determine use of herbal or dietary supplements in arthritis Descriptive design; N = 232 adults aged 18 and over; outpatients from three university practices and three private practices in Indiana; 72% female; completed telephone survey Herbal supplements, Dietary Supplements, Glucosamine Patients with OA and RA used supplements more often than those with FM; 17% reported using herbal supplements; 16% reported using glucosamine and chondroitin 42 Natural Products and Medication Interactions A vital concern to health care providers is that herbal and dietary supplements c an interact with each other and with other medications causing serious adverse e ffects. There are few rigorous studies available on natural products used for arthrit is pain (NCCAM, 2008). Older adults may believe supplements are 'natural' and may b e unaware of the potential interactions these supplements may cause. Older adult s are receiving treatments for other conditions in addition to arthritis, which puts them a t a high risk for experiencing medication interactions. Many natural products (Evening Primrose Oil, Fish Oil, G.L.A., garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng) are be lieved to potentiate the effects of anticoagulants (used to prevent clots in patients with mechanical heart valves, dysrhythmias , or coronary artery disease) leading to severe blee ding problems (NCCAM, 2012). Ingestion of St. John's Wort or Feverfew activates a receptor, named PXR, in the liver and intestines to induce production of Cytochrome P450, which increases drug metabolism and reduces the effect of many medications, including immunosuppressants and cardiovascular drugs (Spolarich & Andrews, 2007). Thunder God Vine may contribute to osteoporosis in women, suppress the immune system, and increase the effects of immunosuppressant drugs. Health care providers use immunosuppressant medications to treat disorders like arthritis and Crohn's disea se and to prevent organ rejection. Fish Oil may interact to potentiate antihypert ensive medications causing severe hypotension. Valerian, when taken with sedatives or alcohol or other sedative type herbs, may cause over sedation. Individuals with arthritis frequently take the popular natural products Glucosamine and chondroitin, which may 43 cause elevations in blood sugar and insulin levels in individuals with diabetes and may interact with the anticoagulant drug warfarin (NCCAM, 2006; NCCAM, 2012). Reporting Use to Health Care Provider Although it is reported that 60% to 90% of people with arthritis are likely to use CAM (Ahmed et al, 2005), 50% to 60% of them do not report this use to their health care provider (Chao, Wade, & Kronberg, 2008; Fautrel, 2002; Rao et al., Sikka, 2003). A study by Rao et al., (1999) of 232 participants with arthritis reported 55% had not informed their physician of their CAM use. Parti cipants in the study used glucosamine and chondroitin supplements, vinegar preparations, chiropractic manipulation, copper bracelets, and spiritual healers to treat the ir arthritis. Brownie (2006) reported similar result in a study of 2,500 older Australian partic ipants. Forty-three percent of participants used supplements such as gingko, valeria n, St John's Wort, vitamins A, C, E, fish oils, and garlic for arthritis pain. Researcher s reported 18% to 42% of participants did not disclose use of these supplements to their health care provider. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey revealed 77% of respondents age d 50 and over had used CAM and taken prescription medications although only 42% of older adults reported it to their physician (AARP & NCCAM, 2011). Sternberg et al., (2003) reported conflicting results in a study of 102 participa nts attending a community based clinic in Chicago, Illinois. Ninety-seven percent of participants used both ingested CAM supplements and prescription medications. Participants reported taking Vitamin E, C, A, calcium and B complex dietary supplements. Participants also reported taking gingko bilboa, garlic, selenium and omega 44 3 fatty acids. Sixty percent of the participants in this study did report use of C AM to their health care provider. Summary Although researchers have conducted many studies on the use of CAM for various diseases, few studies have focused on the specific herbal and dietary suppl ements used by the elderly with arthritis. Previous authors have discussed the danger s of taking CAM with prescription medications, but few studies have revealed which suppleme nts and prescription medications older adults are taking simultaneously. Many authors s tate that underreporting of CAM use occurs although few studies address the actual re porting by participants in each study. Only two of the studies reviewed addressed the percentages of participants reporting use of biological based therapies to thei r health care providers (Brownie, 2006; Rao et al., 1999). The lack of studies reporting the percentages of participants' use of supplements warrants further investi gation. The researcher proposes to identify the particular herbal and dietary supplement s and prescription medications older adults with arthritis are taking and the i ncidence of reporting use of these supplements to their health care providers. The researcher identified only four studies concerning arthritis, use of natu ral products and HRQOL Lapane, et al., 2012). The researcher wil l investigate the use of natural products (dietary and herbal supplements) by older adul ts with OA to decrease chronic pain and improve HRQOL. 45 CHAPTER III METHODOLOGY Design of the Study The study was a descriptive comparative design using a convenience sample of older adults diagnosed with OA recruited from Rheumatology clinics and community settings (church, community center, wellness center) in Southern Mississi ppi. Participants were compared based on no use of medications or natural products, the use of natural products, the use of medications for OA, and the use of a combination of natural products and medications for OA on pain, pain disability, and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine if older adults aged 40 and above with OA (a) use natural products and prescription medications either alone or concurrent ly to manage chronic pain and pain disability; (b) self- report if the use of the nat ural products (dietary and herbal supplements) decreases pain and pain disability; (c) have hi gher health related quality of life if they used natural products than those who did not use natural products; and (d) report the use of natural products, if they used them, to their health care providers. Methods Using a survey, participants reported their demographic information (gender, age , marital status, race, and educational attainment); length of time with arthri tis, types of natural products they were taking; and prescription medications they were taking on the demographic portion of the questionnaire. The participants self-reported their chroni c pain using the Visual Analog Scales (VAS), degree of pain disability using t he Pain 46 Disability Index (PDI) and their perceived health related quality of life using the Arthritis Impact Measurement - 2 Short Form (AIMS2- SF). Sample This study was limited to a convenience sample of adults aged 40 and over that resided in Southern Mississippi who were being treated for OA in Rheumatology clinics or were older adults in the community that self-reported being diagnosed with OA w ere recruited for the study. Inclusion criteria for this study included having a di agnosis of OA, and the ability to read and write English. Participants who could read the questionnaire and write in answers completed the questionnaire and returned it by postage paid mail. The sample size was calculated with G* power statistica l software with a minimum of 200 participants needed for the study. Setting Participants were recruited from three Rheumatology clinics in Southern Mississippi. The participating clinics were two hospital owned clinics and one ph ysician owned clinic. The Rheumatologists agreed to data collection from their patients visiting their clinics (Appendix B). The physicians treated patients with all types of arthritis at their clinics. In the event that recruitment from the Rheumatology clinics did not get the adequate sample size, participants would be recruited from the community by contac ting local organization leaders, church leaders, and the director of the wellness ce nter to request permission to speak to older adults within their facility. 47 Instrumentation Demographic data and the use of natural products were collected using a survey developed by the researcher. Visual Analog Scales (VAS) of chronic pain seve rity was used to measure pain. The Pain Disability Index (PDI) was used to measure disa bility. The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2-Short Form (AIMS2 - SF) w as used to measure health related quality of life. The instruments can be found in (Appendix C ). Demographics and Natural Products The researcher used the demographic questions to assess the personal characteristics of the participants to describe and compare during data anal yses (Appendix C). The demographic portions of the questionnaire gathered information about age, gender, marital status, race, educational level, income level and infor mation related to medications and supplements participants were taking. A comprehensive list of supplements commonly used by individuals with arthritis was included based on a review of the literature. Participants were asked to i ndicate on the questionnaire how often they have taken the listed supplements in the past year. Participants were asked to list any medications either prescribed or over t he counter or topical, oral, etc. that they were using for their arthritis. Lastly, the pa rticipants were asked if they reported the use of natural products to the health care provider and if thei r perception of overall health was poor, fair, good, or excellent Visual Analog Scale (VAS) The VAS is a Likert scale that measures pain. The pain scales are numeri cal with a range from 0 to 10. The 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain ever. 48 Researchers have used the VAS to measure pain, quality of sleep, anxiety and severity of symptoms (Grove, Burns, & Gray, 2013). The researcher used two VAS questions to measure pain. The researcher asked participants to rate their pa in twice: one rating for pain at the time of completing the questionnaire and one rating of pain in t he previous 3 months. The two scales were averaged together to determine levels of pa in among the participants taking no medications, natural products, prescription medicat ions and both natural products and prescription medications. Lower scores indicated less pai n and higher scores indicated higher levels of pain. The validity and reliability of the VAS has been measured in a study of 101 individuals with complaints of abdominal pain presenting to an emergency department (Gallagher, Bijur, Latimer, & Silver, 2002). There was a strong linear rela tionship between VAS scores taken 1 minute apart. The intraclass correlation betwee n VAS scores 1 minute apart was 0.99 (95% CI 0.989 to 0.992). The mean and median VAS scores increased as the pain descriptors increased. The mean clinically s ignificant change in pain was 16 mm (96% CI: 13, 18) with a median of 14 mm. Gallagher and colleagues concluded the VAS was a reliable and valid instrument of measuring acute abdomina l pain in the emergency department (Gallagher et al., 2002). The Cronbach's alpha in t his study was 0.882, which researchers consider as good and indicates the instrument wa s reliable in this study. Pain Disability Index (PDI) The PDI provides important information on functional disability beyond instrumentation such as the Visual Analog Scale. The PDI (Pollard, 1984) uses seve n Likert scales to measure pain disability. The PDI has been used to assess the degree to 49 which chronic pain interferes with daily activities. Instrument categori es include an overall rating of disability and ratings of disability related to seven l ife activities: family and home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior , self- care, and life support activity. In responding to the PDI questions, individuals rate t heir level of disability using an 11-point numerical response format with anchors of zero = no disability to 10 = total disability for each of the seven life activities. Sc oring is done by summing points for all seven parameters with a minimum score of zero and maximum score of 70. The higher the score of an item indicated more of the person's disability due to pain. The psychometric properties of the PDI have been reported in several studies in diverse samples (James et al., 2005; Jerome & Gross, 1991; & 1987). The Cronbach's alpha reliability for the entire PDI was 0.86 indicating a high internal consi stency. The Cronbach's alpha in this study was 0.94. Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2- Short Form (AIMS2- SF) The AIMS2- Short Form (AIMS2-SF) is an instrument designed to measure health outcomes in patients diagnosed with rheumatic disorders (Guillemin et al ., 1997). The instrument has 26 items that measures health status using specific 5- point s cales for physical, psychological, and social functioning. The AIMS2- SF was developed fr om the original AIMS and AIMS-2 questionnaires to create a shorter version for ease in us e and quicker completion time of approximately 10 minutes (Guillemin et al., 1997). The AIMS2- SF assesses health outcomes of the following five dimensions: physica l functioning (12 items), symptoms (3 items), social interaction (4 items), role ( 2 items), 50 and affect (five items). Illness related stressors are measured in fi ve aggregated dimensions: physical functioning (walking and bending, hand and finger function, sel f- care,), affect (level of tension, mood), symptoms (joint pain), role (work), and soc ial interaction (social activities, support from family and friends). The scal e items in the physical functioning, social interaction, symptoms, and role dimensions are anchore d by 'all days, most days, and some days' to 'few days or no days.' The affect subsca les are anchored by 'always, very often, sometimes' to 'almost never or never. Scores a re summed with a range from zero (best health status) to 100 (poorest health status). Psychometric properties of the AIMS2-SF have been tested and found to be vali d and reliable in several studies (Ten Klooster, Veehof, Taal, VanRiel, Meenan, 1999; Guillemin et al., 1997). The reliability of the AIMS2-SF using Cronbach's alpha coefficients range from 0.74-0.87. Exceptions ha ve been the social interaction subscale (ranging from 0.32-0.67) and the role scale (Gignac, Cao, McAlpine, & Badley, 2011). The convergent validity of the AIMS2-SF (physic al and symptoms components with clinical variables) was r = 0.24-0.59. The test-retest reproducibility was > 0.7 and the sensitivity to change was a mean of 0.36 - 0.8 except for social interaction of 0.08 - all very close to the original AIMS2. The AIMS2-SF had psychometric properties similar to the AIMS2 longer version and the shortened instrument is easier to use for repeated measures (Guillemin et al., 1997). Gignac et al, (2011) reported the AIMS2-SF has comparable criterion validity with other measur es of disability and health status (e.g., modified Health Assessment Questionnair e [MHAQ], Short Form - 36 [SF-36] the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Inde x). A subsequent study was conducted by Ren et al., (1999) using the AIM2-SF with N= 147 51 individuals with OA. AIMS2-SF scales demonstrated a high item-discrimina nt validity and Cronbach's alpha reliability above the 0.70 criterion (except 0.67 for the social function scale). Each of the five scales measures a distinct aspect of he alth status for patients with OA. Researchers concluded it is a reliable and valid instrument t o use to evaluate functional status among patients with OA. These findings support the use of the AIMS2-SF to assess physical, emotional, and social wellbeing in the arthrit ic population. The Cronbach's alpha in this study was 0.933, which researchers consider as exce llent and indicates the instrument was reliable in this study . Protection of Participants The University of Southern Mississippi Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study before data collection began (Appendix A). After not receiving enough participants from the Rheumatology clinics, the researcher obtained a modi fied approval from the IRB to collect data from participants in community settings. Participants were informed in the cover letter that no personal identifying i nformation would be collected and that all health information was confidential and participat ion was voluntary. There were no penalties for declining to participate in the study. The participant's return of the completed questionnaire was their consent to participat e in the study. There was minimal risk to the participants. The participants may have experienced temporary physical discomfort of joint stiffness or muscle te nsion while writing or sitting when completing the questionnaire. The participants may have experienced discomfort similar to what the participant would have experience d in his or her daily life and that should have ceased after completion of the questionnaire. The 52 participants were able to take the questionnaire home to complete it. The questi onnaire was self-administered and the participants were instructed that they mi ght use a highlighter to check boxes and a pen or pencil to fill in the blanks. The use of a highlighter may have been more comfortable for patients with joint stiffness a nd discomfort although no questionnaires were returned that were highlighted. The participants mailed the questionnaire back to the researcher. Participant s recruited in the community also took the survey home to complete it and returned it to the researcher b y postage paid mail. No emotional or economic risks were foreseeable. Partici pants could not be identified by name or other identifiers. Participants were informed that the findings of the study may be disseminated through presentations or publications but would not include any identifying information. Procedure and Data Collection The researcher recruited participants from three different rheumatolog y clinics in Southern Mississippi and in various community settings (church, community center, wellness center) in an effort to obtain a broader representation of the population and to obtain sufficient numbers of participants for analyses. Office staff at the Rheumatology clinics asked the patients at the time they exited from the office visit if they would like to participate in the study. The receptionists at the rheumatology clinics or the researcher in the community settings gave individuals interested in participating in the stud y a packet with a cover letter (Appendix B), the questionnaire (Appendix C), a postage paid self- addressed envelope and a rubber jar opener as an incentive and a thank- you for participating in the study. The receptionist or researcher asked the partic ipants to read the cover letter, complete the questionnaire and return it to the researcher by m ail in a 53 postage paid envelope. The participant's took the survey home to be completed, which allowed the participants the time necessary to complete the questionnaire in a comfortable environment. The expected response rates for mailed questionnaires reported in the literature range from 20% to 60% (Grove et al., 2013; Salant & Dillman, 1994). Using the most conservative return rate of 20%, distribution of 800 questionnaires to clinics and various settings in the community were required in order to achieve a return rate of 200 questionnaires. Research packets were provided to the clinics until there were no f urther questionnaires returned by mail. The rheumatology clinics were contacte d weekly to ascertain how many questionnaires the clinics needed. In order to meet the sample s ize, IRB approval was obtained to recruit participants from community centers, chur ch groups, and older adults attending exercise classes at a wellness center. P articipants were invited to participate in the study and were given packets of information with sur veys to return. Participation was voluntary and there were no threats for not participating . The participants were able to take the survey home to complete it and return it to the researcher in a postage paid envelope. The researcher did not obtain any personal identifying information from participants. Analysis of Data The questionnaires were examined for clearly marked answers, and missing answers. Missing values were checked with the hard copy of the questionnaire a nd missing information was inserted as appropriate. Missing data not answered b y participants was coded as -99. Questions were coded with alphanumerical labels . A codebook was created that identified and defined each variable; each abbreviate d variable 54 name, a descriptive variable label, and the range of possible numerical values of e very variable that the researcher entered into the computer. Data was entered into S PSS 22.0 statistical software program for analysis. Items were randomly re checked for accuracy using every 20 th questionnaire with the database to ensure coding was correct. The researcher dichotomized the participants intake of natural products and prescr iption medications into 'Used or not used'. The researcher categorized them a s 'None', 'prescription only', 'Natural only', and 'both'. The researcher transformed nd recoded the variables pain, pain disability, and HRQOL into single variables. The AIM S2-SF was reverse coded to prepare for input and analyses. The researcher compared the differences between groups of participants w ith OA who did not take any medications, groups of participants who took prescription medications only, groups of participants who took natural products only, and groups of participants who took both and pain, pain disability and HRQOL. Chi square, t-tests, and analysis of variance were used to compare the 4 groups on demographic data, pain, pain disability, and quality of life. ANOVA was used to anal yze variance or differences between groups not taking medications, taking prescri ption medications only, taking natural products only, or taking both prescription medications and natural products. The assumption of normality was examined with histograms, Q -Q plots, and box plots. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test was also used to examine normality. Extreme values or outliers were examined to determine issues re lated to data entry. Outliers were removed to decrease error and to meet the assumption of nor mality. The assumption of homogeneity of variance was tested using Levene's statist ical test. Descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, measures of central tenden cy, and measures 55 of variation) were used to describe the sample and analyze the number of partic ipants that did not take any medications, took natural products only, and took prescription medications only or both to determine the groups. Frequency and percentages were measured of the participant's intake of each specific type of natural product, and t he participant's frequency and percentage of intake of prescription medications. ANOVA was used to determine if pain, pain disability, and HRQOL differed between the 4 groups. Differences of the 4 groups including not taking any medications, taking medications only, taking natural products only or both taking medications with natural products were compared on demographic variables using ANOVA and chi-square analysis. Post-hoc tests with Tukey's HSD were utilized to determine dif ferences in the groups with pain, pain disability, and HRQOL. A significance level of p = 0.05 was used to test statistical significance of the research questions. Frequenci es and percentages were used to determine the participants that did or did not report use of natural products to health care providers. 56 CHAPTER IV ANALYSIS OF DATA Introduction The presentation of the data and analyses of each research question and are provided in this chapter. The purpose of this study was to determine if older adults aged 40 and above with OA (a) use natural products and prescription medications either alone or concurrently to manage chronic pain; (b) self- report if the use of the natural product s (dietary and herbal supplements) decreases pain and pain disability; (c) had hi gher health related quality of life if they used natural products than those who did not use natural products; and (d) report the use of natural products, if they used them, to their health care providers. Analyses of data were completed using SPSS statistical software. Th e demographic data analysis was completed using Descriptive statistics. ANOVA was used to analyze data associated with the research questions. The study met the assumption of independence because the participants were not in more than one group. The Levene's test results were p >.05 indicating variances were homogeneous . Description of Sample The sample for this study consisted of 204 older adults diagnosed with OA who resided in Southern Mississippi. Demographic data collected from particip ants included gender, age, marital status, race, level of education, and income. In addition, participants asked the number of years they had been diagnosed with OA and their general health status. Participants were asked to identify the types of multivitamins and natur al products they are taking and the frequency of intake. The participants indicated if the y had or had 57 not reported use of the natural products to their health care provider. The researcher asked participants to list any prescription medications they were taking t o manage their Osteoarthritis. The participants rated their pain on two pain scales indicati ng level of pain currently and in the last three months. The participants reported the degree to which their pain affected their home life, recreational and social activity, oc cupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and activities of daily living using the Pain Disabili ty Index instrument. The participants HRQOL was reported using the AIMS2-SF to asse ss physical functioning, symptoms, affect, social activity, and work roles. Tabl es 4 thorough 6 presents the finding associated with the participants gender, age and race/ethnicity. Typically the participant, was female (n=156; 76.5%), betwe en the ages of and were White, non-Hispanic (n=186; 91.2%).

What are the specific types of natural products (dietary and herbal supplements) and prescription medications that older adults with OA take? The researcher used descriptive statistics to measure this question. Table 13 illus trates the natural products that participants are taking daily. The most commonly used supplem ents were Multivitamins 97; 47.5%). There were (n = 115) participants that did not take any supplements. 64 Table 13 Frequency Distribution of Natural Products taken Daily Daily Supplements n % Multivitamins 125 61.3 Calcium 108 52.9 Vitamin A 21 10.3 Vitamin B 40 19.6 Vitamin C 53 26 Vitamin D 97 47.5 Vitamin E 35 17.2 Borage Seed Oil 0 0 Boswellia 0 0 Cat's Claw 0 0 Chondroitin 18 8.8 CoQ10 24 11.8 DSM/MSM 5 2.5 Evening Primrose Oil 1 .5 Feverfew 1 .5 Fish Oil 44 21.6 65 Table 13 (continued).

Is there a difference in pain between 4 groups of patients with OA (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products)? Pain is indicated on a 0-10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain. The VAS for current pain and pain in the last 3 months were averaged. Table 15 presents the means and standard deviations between the groups (no medications, natural products only, prescription medications only, both natural products and prescription medications) , 67 and levels of pain. Participants with the highest level of pain used both prescription medication and natural products (M= 4.75; SD= 2.04) followed by participants with the next highest level of pain taking prescription medications only (M= 3.86; SD= 2.28). Participants with lesser pain used natural products only (M= 2.82; SD= 2.19). Participants with the least amount of pain used no medications (M= 1.56; SD= 1.50). According to ANOVA results shown in Table 16, there is a statistically signif icant difference in pain levels among the groups F (3, 197) = 20.021, p < .001. The researcher did not use ANCOVA because the assumptions of ANCOVA were not met, as there were no covariates identified in correlation tests. The researcher used Tukey's HSD to determine the differences in pain betwee n the groups (Table 17). The post-hoc test revealed there was a statistical ly significant difference in pain between participants taking no medications and prescript ion medications only (p = .018), participants taking no medications and both prescription medications and natural products (p = < .001) and participants taking natural products only and both prescription medications and natural products (p = <.001). There were no statistically significant differences between participants taking no m edications and natural products only (p = .079), participants taking prescription medications only and natural products only (p = .411) and participants taking prescription medications only and both prescription medications and natural products (p = .526). This analysis reveals participants with more pain took both natural products and prescription medications. 68 Table 15 Means and Standard Deviations of Participants' Pain Levels Groups n Mean Std.

The majority of women used both natural products and prescription medications (n = 85; 55.6%) while men used either natural products (n = 15; 31.3%) or both (n = 15; n = 31.3%). Lower percentages of men may be related to underrepresentation of men in the study. Data presented in Table 24 demonstrate women take both prescription medications and natural products concurrently (n = 85; M = 55.6%) followed by women taking natural products only (n = 55; M = 35.9). Men were shown to take both prescription medications and natural products and natural products only (n = 15; 31.3%) at the highest levels for men only. Men took prescription medications only the least out of all four categories for men (n = 4; 8.3%). Women took no medications the least (n = 6; 3.9 %) of all four categories for women.

The majority of participants w ith a Graduate Degree (higher education) took both natural products and prescription medications (n = 21; 65.6%). The majority of participants with a less than High School education took natural products only (n = 9; 64.3%). A chi- square test of independence was calculated comparing use of natural products and prescription medication with educational level. A statistically sig nificant difference was found (x2 (15) = 18.11, p < .05) for all levels of education. Table 25 presents data analysis with Chi-square with education level and not taking prescr iption medications, taking prescriptions only, taking naturals only and taking both prescr iption medications and natural products. The participants with Graduate level or Higher education degrees took both prescription medications and natural products more than any other participants with lesser education (n=21; 65.6%). The participants with a les s than high school education took natural products only at a higher percentage (n = 9; 64.3%) than no medications, prescription only or both groups. A chi-square test to compare the higher education level participants with the high school or GED participants could not be computed with an n of less than 5 in the higher education and prescription only group. In order to compute the chi-square, the educational levels were recoded into a college or no college variable. The college variable was participants with a college or higher education degree. The no colle ge variable was participants with a less than high school, high school/GED and vocationa l educational level. The chi-square analysis was then computed for excluding the participants taking prescription medications only in the higher education group. The chi- square was calculated comparing the frequency of the college group with the no college 78 group. No significant difference was found (x 2 (2) = 1.539, p > .05). Having a college degree or not are independent in taking no medications, natural products, or both prescription medication or natural products.

A description of the sample, demographic variables, research ques tions, were presented. The study sample consisted of 204 older adults diagnosed with Osteoarthritis and residing in Southern Mississippi. The researcher re cruited participants from three physicians' offices, community sings, a wellness center, and a loc al church. The majority of the participants were Females aged 61 to 80 who were White, Non- Hispanic, married, and had a High School or GED level of education. The majority of participants has an income of $40,000 or less and has had arthritis for 10 years or less. The participants largely rated their health as being good. Participants with a less than High School education took natural products only whereas those with higher education took both prescription medications and natural products. Participants took vitamins overall more than any other natural products. The participants took more NSAIDS t han all other prescription medications. Participants with higher pain, pain disabil ity, and lower HRQOL took both prescription medications and natural products. The majority of participants did not report use of natural products to their health care provider. Furt her discussion of the research results, conclusions, limitations, and recommendations f or future research are presented in Chapter V. 81 CHAPTER V DISCUSSION, LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATI ONS Introduction This chapter will provide discussions, conclusions, limitations, and future recommendations based on the findings of this research. Summary of Literature Review The literature revealed arthritis is a prevalent condition causing chronic pa in in older adults (Arthritis Foundation, 2012). Patients with arthritis experience di fficulty with daily activities and disability, which leads them to seek out pain relief measures. Older adults with chronic conditions are increasingly using natural products and prescription medications in an effort to relieve their chronic pain (AARP & NC CAM, 2011; NCCAM, 2008). Natural products are readily available at low cost and without a physician's order. Patients are taking both natural products and prescription medi cations without the permission or knowledge of their health care provider, which puts them at higher risk for interactions of medications (Brownie, 2006; Johnson, 1999). Health care providers, particularly nurses must be aware of the types of natural products pat ients are taking so they may educate their patients on possible interactions and help them to sa fely integrate the use of natural products with prescription medications (NCCAM, 2011). The NIH has called for more research into the prevalence and types of natural product s individuals are taking to help determine which natural products have the highest prior ity for research into the safety and efficacy of those products (NIH, 2013). 82 Discussion This research study collected demographic data, the prevalence and specific natural products and prescription medications older adults are taking to manage thei r arthritis and participants perceptions of their pain, pain disability, and HRQOL . Patients suffering with the chronic pain from arthritis seek various modalities and tre atments in an effort to decrease pain and to increase physical and psychological functioni ng. The transactional theory of stress and coping by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) supports the premise that individuals use active problem-solving strategies to help them cope wi th the stress of pain, loss of functional mobility, and psychological distress that further exacerbates pain. Primary appraisal occurs when individuals cognitively appraise their situation as being stressful and endangering their well-being. Partic ipants in this study used primary appraisal when they assessed that their pain was interfer ing with their physical, psychological, and social well-being and their ability to cope w ith their situation. Secondary appraisal occurs when an individual feels threatened or cha llenged and they evaluate what they can do to help them cope with their situation. Partici pants in this study used secondary appraisal when they made the decision to take nat ural products alone or with prescription medications as a problem solving strategy to relieve pai n and improve physical and psychological functioning. Lazarus and Folkman (1984) expla ined the expected outcomes for appraising and coping with stress are to improve phy sical and social functioning, life satisfaction and somatic health. Participants in this study appraised their pain, decreased physical, psychological, and social functioning a s being a threat to their well-being and they used natural products and prescription medicat ions in an effort to improve their physical, psychological and social health outcomes. 83 Research Question One What are the specific types of natural products and prescription medications that older adults with OA take? The most commonly used supplements were Multivitami ns (n = 125, 61.3%), Calcium (n = 108; 52.9%) and Vitamin D (n = 97; 47.5%) The participants in this study largely used natural products only (n = 71; 34.8%) or natural products concurrently with prescription medications (n = 100; 49%) which are simil ar to previous reports (Hoerster et al., 2012). The use of vitamins as a CAM modality is similar to previous studies reporting prevalence of use for arthritis as high a s 97% (Rao et al., 1999). The use of other dietary and herbal supplements was also noted by previous researchers to have a prevalence of use from as little as 2.3 % to higher prevale nce rates of 93% (Rao et al., 1999; Rolniak et al., 2004). The higher use of calcium and vitamin D are related to bone health and is expected in patients with OA. Participants in this study used non-vitamin supplements from 1% up to 22%. Previous studies have reported use of non-vitamin supplements ranging from 2.3% to (Cherniack, Senzel & Pan, 2001) to 93% (Rao et al., 1999). The low percentage of participants taking non vitamin herbal supplements in this study although the same as previous studies is unexpected given the use of herbal supplements has increased nationally in more recent studies of up to 25.26% (Hoerster et al., 2012). The participants in this study reported taking NSAIDs prescribed to them more than opioids or other medications used to treat OA (n = 65; 57.5%). This is an expected finding as NSAIDS are commonly prescribed instead of opioids to treat chronic arthritis pain, as it is a progressive disease that may require treatment with opioids w hen pain 84 becomes unmanageable with other medications (Culberson et al., 2011; Ferrell et a l., 2002; Smith & Bruckenthal, 2010; Tse et al., 2005). Research Question Two Is there a difference in pain between 4 groups of patients with OA (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products)? Forty-nine per cent of the participants reported taking natural products and prescription medications concurrently to relieve pain. Thirty-five per cent of the participants reported only taking natural products. These results are sim ilar to previous findings (Jawahar et al., 2012: Lapane et al., 2012). Although (49%) took both prescription medications and natural products they reported their pain levels as higher than participants not taking medications, taking prescription only or natural products only. The researcher cannot infer causality with intake of natural products a nd prescription medications and participants that are taking both prescription medi cations and natural products but results show they do have higher levels of pain. The effic acy of the use of taking medications and natural products is beyond the scope of this study but findings indicate pain relief is inadequate for these individuals. Findings of this study indicate participants with OA that are taking natural products only are not m anaging their pain and seek out prescription medications in an effort to relieve pain. The participant s with higher levels of pain (n = 100; M = 4.75) also had high levels of pain disability ( n = 100; M= 3.84) and lower HRQOL scores (n = 100; 58.63%). 85 Research Question Three Is there a difference in pain disability between 4 groups of patients with OA (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products)? Forty-nine percent of participants in this study reported taking both prescripti on medications and natural products concurrently to relieve pain. Thirty-five per c ent of the participants reported only taking natural products. These results are simi lar to previous findings (Jawahar et al., 2012, Lapane et al., 2012). Participants with the highest pa in disability took both prescription medications and natural products (M = 25.42; SD = 14.73) followed by participants taking prescription medications only (M = 21.27; SD = 14.04). Participants taking prescription medications only (5.4%) reported more pai n disability than participants taking natural products only. The participants ta king natural products alone had lesser pain disability than participants taking prescription m edications alone or both. These findings while not conclusive of cause and effect indicates participants with lesser pain disability manage their pain disability wi th natural products only. As pain disability increases participants try adding prescription medic ations to manage their pain disability. Participants with the highest pain disability ul timately use both prescription medications and natural products to improve their ability to manage family responsibilities, social activity, and self-care abilities . Research Question Four Is there a difference in health related quality of life between 4 groups of pa tients with OA (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take 86 medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products)? The majority of participants taking both natural products and prescription medications reported worst health (M = 58.63; SD = 13.35). Participants taking prescription medications only (5.4%) have the highest means of HRQOL (M = 59.72; SD = 13.52) indicating the Worst Health Scores. The next highest mean of worst heal th are participants taking both prescription medications and natural products (M= 58.63; SD = 13.35). Participants not taking any medications reported highest scores of HRQO L indicating best health (n = 20; M = 45.83). These findings are supported in previous research (Jawahar et al., 2012; Lapane et al., 2012). The results of this study indi cate that as participants began having difficulty with managing physical functioning, s ymptoms, psychological functioning, social interaction, and work roles, they sought tr eatment with both prescription medications and natural products. Research Question Five Are there differences by the 4 groups (those who take no medications or natural products, those who take medications, those who take natural products, and those who take medications and natural products) on demographics? The majority of participa nts were women (n = 156; 76.5%) with lesser representation by men (n = 48; 23.5%). The results show the majority of women take both prescription medications and natural products concurrently (n = 85; 55.6%) followed by women taking natural products only (n = 55; 35.9%). Men were shown to take both prescription medications and natural products and natural products only (n = 15; 31.3%) at the highest levels for men only. Men took prescription medications only the least out of all four categories for men ( n = 4; 87 8.3%). Women took no medications the least (n = 6; 3.9 %) of all four categories for women. Findings that women take more natural products than men are supported in previous studies (Jawahar et al., 2012; Lapane et al., 2012; Rao et., 1999). The majority of participants had attended college (n = 117; 57.3%). Participants with a high school education or General Education Diploma (GED) (n = 61; 29.9%) reported taking both prescription medications and natural products the most (n=30; 50%). This finding is in contrast to a previous research study by Lapane (2012) and colleag ues that found participants with a High School education took prescription medications only. The participants in this study with a college degree or graduate level or higher education degrees took both prescription medications and natural products more than any other participants with lesser education (n = 19; 50%; n = 21; 65.6%) respectively. These findings differ from Lapane's study (2012) that reported participants with a col lege degree used CAM including natural products only. The participants with a less than hig h school education took natural products only at a higher percentage (n = 9; 64.3%) than no medications, prescription only or both groups. The majority of the participants (n = 58; 28.4%) reported having a yearly income of $20,000 or less. These findings may indica te participants with a lesser education have less income and therefore have les s access to costly health care including prescription medications and may seek out natural produc ts instead. Research Question Six Do the individuals with OA that are taking natural products concurrently with prescription medications report this use to their health care provider? The major ity of participants using natural products did not report use to their health care provider (n = 88 134; 65.7%) which is higher in this study than in previous findings (AARP & NCCAM, 2011). The reasons participants are not reporting use to their health care provider ma y be lack of understanding of the possible interactions that can occur and not being aware t hat even though natural products are dietary supplements they should report their use to the ir health care provider. Limitations A limitation of the study was not being able to determine if the participants use of natural products and medications had an impact on decreasing pain and pain disability and improving health related quality of life. The research questions did inquire about levels of pain, pain disability, and HRQOL but did not specifically ask participa nts to report if the use of natural products and prescription medications produced a decrease i n pain and pain disability and improvement in HRQOL. Another limitation identified is the need to assess the different types of prescription medications participants are taking for conditions other than OA. Participants may have other chronic conditions for which they are taking prescr iption medications, which increases their risk for interactions between natural pro ducts and prescription medications. Many natural products are believed to potentiate the effects of anticoagulants given for cardiovascular diseases. Assessing chronic condit ions and use of all prescription medications will help inform the health care providers of additi onal potential medication interactions. Conclusions Individuals with OA are continuing to experience moderate levels of pain, pain disability, and decreased HRQO and are taking natural products and prescripti on 89 medications to relieve pain. Findings of this study demonstrate individuals with OA a re taking both natural products and several types of prescription medications in an effo rt to decrease pain and pain disability and increase HRQOL. The participants taking both natural products and prescription medications are at increased risk of medica tion interactions and side effects. Health care providers need to be aware of the nat ural products and prescription medications their patients are taking so they may educat e their patients on the risks and benefits of taking natural products. Health care providers will benefit from the knowledge of the current patterns of use of natural products and prescription medications by patients with OA to better inform and guide curr ent practice for treating OA and educating their patients on the need to report use of natural produc ts as well as monitoring them for interactions. Recommendations Further studies need to be conducted to explore the use of particular types of natural products and their efficacy in decreasing pain, pain disability, and impr oving HRQOL. Very few studies address the use of natural products and prescription medications in patients with OA and their perceptions of pain, disability, and HRQOL since they started taking prescription medications only, natural products only, or both. The participant's perception of their pain, pain disability, and HRQOL while ta king natural products should continue to be investigated. 90 APPENDIX A INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD NOTICE OF COMMITTEE ACTION 91 92 APPENDIX B COVER LETTER Dear Sir or Madam: I am a graduate student at the University of Southern Mississippi College of Nursing in Hattiesburg, MS.
