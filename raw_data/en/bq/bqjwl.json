Leventhal At heart, we all have the capacity to heal ourselves and nurture others. Spirit, energy, thought, intention, skillful practice, and belief are available to all people. Yet as individual expressions of the life force, we all have different paths, and not all of us feel called to healing practices. (Note: if you feel like you're called to be a spiritual healer, you might like to learn the art of getting grounded and connected with your root and sacral chakra - this is vital for staying healthy and balanced. I recommend checking out our [Grounding & Cleansing Chakra Bundle](https://shop.lonerwolf.com/product/grounding-cleansing-chakra-bundle/) for further support to supplement this article.) Spiritual Healing and Social Rejection For those of us that do feel \"called\" to [spiritual healing](https://lonerwolf.com/spiritual-healing/), we are often met with some kind of resistance, either from our friends, our family members, or our culture. This is because spiritual healing can be frowned upon as a quasi, scientifically-misguided, charlatan practice by a society that is built on the mind and ego. While there are con artists in every practice, the genuinely beneficial aspects of spiritual healing are largely ignored because they can't be quantified or reasoned with. Unfortunately, this has led to a large percentage of us (particularly in Westernised societies) losing touch with traditional forms of healing. Very few of us were raised around shamans, medicine men or medicine women who could pass on ancient knowledge and holistic healing practices. Instead, as children we were taken to GPs, physicians and doctors who prescribed us with medications of all kinds. And while these medications were useful and helped to fix certain parts of us, they never aided us in healing our whole organism with its many layers. Yet despite the way you were raised, you might still feel a strong pull towards spiritual healing, even if it \"goes against the grain\" of what you were taught. So are you a spiritual healer? Let's find out. 30 Signs You're a Spiritual Healer If you're a spiritual healer, you will sense it deep down. You might feel like an [old soul](https://shop.lonerwolf.com/product/old-souls-ebook/) who doesn't quite belong in this time or place, an [empath](https://lonerwolf.com/empath/) who feels everything too deeply, or quite simply [an outsider](https://lonerwolf.com/outsider-looking-in/) or [lone wolf](https://lonerwolf.com/lone-wolf/) who can't seem to properly integrate into society. On a personal level, I've always known in my blood and bones that I'm a healer. As a child, I was thoughtful, inquisitive, dreamy, and extremely nurturing. I remember caring for the kids at school, caring excessively for my toys, caring for stranded insects that got caught in spider webs, and caring a whole lot about the \"bigger picture\" in life. I also remember playing with energy, having precognitive dreams, being hyper-sensitive to the physical and emotional environments around me and somehow always attracting wounded people into my life.

Spiritual healers are [shamans](https://lonerwolf.com/shaman-signs/) in their own right.

Spiritual Healer Q&A Think you might be drawn toward the role of the spiritual healer, but are still unsure? Here are some commonly asked questions that might help you out: Spiritual healers come in many shapes, forms, and modalities. However, overall, a spiritual healer's focus is on the non-physical realm: the Soul, Spirit, and energetic layers of a person. Most spiritual healers focus on helping a person reconnect with their [Soul](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-a-soul/) by clearing away old energy, identifying inner blockages, and channeling healing energy. They may choose to work with ancestral trauma, past life issues, chakra imbalances, [soul loss](https://lonerwolf.com/soul-loss/), or anything that is causing unhappiness and disharmony. There are many courses out there offered to certify you and sharpen your skills, however, this is not necessary to become a spiritual healer. Spiritual healing is an innate calling that comes from the Soul: it can't be handed to you on a piece of paper. Many people study intensively by themselves - however, with that being said, formal study can help to hone these innate talents. To become a spiritual healer, focus on what subjects and topics you're drawn to - that is your path. Yes and no. Spiritual healing is an inborn gift. If you're a highly sensitive and naturally compassionate person, chances are you are a born healer. But spiritual healing doesn't suit everyone - even those with the innate gift. To be a spiritual healer, you need to have done a lot of [inner work](https://lonerwolf.com/inner-work/) (working through your own wounds), have a high level of integrity, and be a grounded person. Some people find spiritual healing too overwhelming and intense, so keep that in mind when pursuing this path. *** As a healer, the best possible place you could start is with yourself. As the proverb goes, \"Physician, heal thyself!\" Starting from within first is the best way to ensure that you have enough energy, passion, and love to give to others.
