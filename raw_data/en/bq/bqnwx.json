Natural bioactive molecules have also been presumed to be safer than synthesized chemical compounds [2]. Many of these compounds have been identified as potential anticancer agents[3-10]. Physalis angulata L (Solanaceae) is a plant widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Extracts or infusions of this plant have been used in various countries in popular medicine as treatment for a variety of illnesses, such as malaria, asthma, hepatitis, der- matitis and rheumatism [11]. Several studies have investigated the anticancer potential of P angulata, which showed that the organic extracts and some purified compounds possess cyto- toxic activity against several tumor cell lines and sarcoma 180 tumor cells transplanted into mice [12]. The cytotoxicity of this plant has been attributed to the physalins, an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP)[13]. The UPP and autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) are the two major systems for eukaryotic intracellular pro- tein clearance that are functionally coupled to maintain homeo stasis [14, 15]. The UPP is responsible for the degradation * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Methods: Human HCT116 colon cancer cell line was tested. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected, and relevant proteins were measured using Western blot analyses. Autophagosomes were observed in stable GFP-LC3 HCT116 cells. Localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes was evaluated in GFP-LC3/RFP-LAMP1-co-transfected cells. Microtubules and microfilaments were observed with confocal microscope. Mitochondrial ROS (mito-ROS) was detected with flow cytometry in the cells stained with MitoSox dye. Results: Physalin B inhibited the viability of HCT116 cells with an IC 50 value of 1.35 mol/L. Treatment of the cells with physalin B (2.5-10 mol/L) induced apoptosis and the cleavage and caspase-3. Meanwhile, physalin B treatment induced autophagosome formation, and accumulation of LC3-II and p62, but decreased Beclin 1 protein level. Marked changes of microtubules and F-actin microfilaments were observed in physalin B-treated cells, which led the blockage of co-localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Physalin B increased the phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK in cells, Moreover, physalin B treatment dose-dependently increased mito-ROS production in the cells, whereas the ROS scavenger NAC could reverse physalin B-induced effects, including incomplete autophagic response, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, changes of microtubules and F-actin, activation of p38, ERK and JNK, as well as cell death and apoptosis. Conclusion: Physalin B induces mito-ROS, which not only inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway but also induces incomplete autophagic response in Acta Pharmacologica Sinicanpg of short-lived proteins, whereas the ALP is responsible for the degradation of most long-lived proteins and some organelles. Proteasome inhibitors, such as Bortezomib, have high tumors[16, 17], and autophagy inhibi- tors, being evaluated as potential antitumor agents[18]. In addition, the combined inhibition of UPP and ALP would cause more cancer cell death than block-ing either degradation pathway alone [19, 20]. In the present study, we show that in contrast with other reported UPP inhibitors, physalin B induces an incomplete autophagic response along with blocked lysosome degrada-tion. Further analysis shows that the inhibition of the two degradation pathways and apoptosis are dependent on mito- ROS generation.

The cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (negative control), 5 mol/L rapamycin (an autophagy inducer) and 10 mol/L physalin B for 12 h, followed by observation using the Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). observed using an immunocytochem- istry assay [25]. Briefly, the cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h, treated with 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B for 12 h, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with a monoclonal -tubulin antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The cells were then washed three times with 1\u00d7PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 labeled donkey anti-Mouse IgG at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were washed and photographed using the Olym- pus Fluoview FV1000 confocal were phalloidin according to the manufacturer's instruc- tions.

The coverslips were washed and photographed using the Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Measurements of mito-ROS level The level of mito-ROS was measured using the MitoSox TM Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (Cat #M36008, Life Tech- nologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufac- turer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were treated with physa-lin B for 4 h, collected upon trypsin treatment, washed twice with ice cold 1\u00d7PBS, and incubated with 5 mol/L MitoSOX for 20 min in the dark. The level of mito-ROS was measured using a BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer and analyzed using FCS Express V3 software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Sulforhodamine B (SRB) viability assay The SRB assay was used to evaluate the effect of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on the growth of physa- lin B-treated cells. Briefly, the cells (3000 cells per well) were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured at 37 \u00b0C. After 24 h, physalin B at final concentrations ranging from 10 mol/L to 0.31 mol/L at a dilution ratio of 1:2 with or without NAC (final concentration: 10 mmol/L) was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Then, the cells were fixed using 3.3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and stained with 0.4% SRB dissolved in 1% (v/v) acetic acid for 30 min. Unbound dye was removed by four washes with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mmol/L Tris base (pH 10.5) for 5 min. The optical density was deter- mined at 510 nm using a VersaMax Microplate Reader (Molec-ular Devices). The experiments were performed in triplicate. The IC 50 values were derived from a nonlinear regression model (curvefit) based on a sigmoidal dose response curve (variable slope) and computed using GraphPad Prism (Ver- sion 5.02, GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA, USA).

Results Physalin B induces apoptosis and an initial stage of autophagy in human HCT116 colon cancer cells The anticancer activity of physalin B (Figure 1A) was evalu- ated in HCT116 colon cancer cells using the MTT viability assay. Nuclei staining and Western blot analysis were utilized to detect the apoptotic status of HCT116 cells treated with physalin B. Physalin B exerted anticancer activity with an IC 50 value of approximately 1.35 \u00b5mol/L (Figure 1B). Physalin B induced pyknosis and the 1C), PARP cleavage and caspase-3 cleavage (Figure 1D) after a 24 h treatment, suggesting that physalin B induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Others have reported that physalin B could inhibit UPP, but its effect on ALP has not been studied. Here we used GFP-LC3 stably-transfected HCT116 cells to monitor autophago- some formation. After a 12 h treatment, physalin B induced autophagosome formation in GFP-LC3 stably-transfected HCT116 cells (Figure 1E). In addition, Western blot detection of autophagy marker LC3-II showed the accumulation of LC3-II in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 1F), suggest- ing that autophagy was occurring. Beclin 1 and mTOR are not required for the physalin B-induced autophagic response Beclin 1 is a canonical autophagy marker that has a central role in autophagy. The expression level of Beclin 1 is upregulated during the canonical autophagic process. Autophagy can also be induced by the inhibition of TOR (target of rapamycin). mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase that balances diverse anabolic processes such as cell proliferation, cell survival, and protein synthesis, plays a vital role at the interface of the pathways that coordinately regulate the balance between cell growth and autophagy. Here we detected the protein level of Beclin 1 and phosphorylation level of mTOR at Ser-2448 using Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1F, after a 9 h treat- ment, physalin B induced LC3-II accumulation, indicating the initiation of autophagosome formation. Additionally, the protein level of Beclin 1 decreased and the phosphorylation level of mTOR did not change, suggesting that Beclin1 and mTOR are not required for the 1.

Cells were treated with physalin B at doses ranging from 10 \u00b5mol/L to 0.31 \u00b5mol/L for 72 h. The cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. IC 50 value is expressed as the mean\u00b1SEM of four independent experiments. (C) Physalin B induced pyknosis and formation of apoptotic bodies. Cells were treated with 5 and 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B for 24 h and further stained with Hoechst 33342 and observed under microscope. (D) Cells were treated with 2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B. Samples were collected at 12, 24, and 36 h, separately. Levels of PARP and caspase-3 were detected using Western blotting assay. (E) Physalin B induced autophagosome formation in GFP-LC3-expressing HCT116 GFP-LC3-expressing with 10 B, 0.1% DMSO (negative control) and 5 \u00b5mol/L rapamycin (positive control) for 12 h. Autophagosomes were observed under an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). (F) Cells were treated with 2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B. Samples were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 h separately. Levels of LC3, p62, Beclin-1, pSer2448- mTOR, of autophagosomes - somes in the late stage of autophagy p62 accumulates when autophagy is inhibited, and decreased levels can be observed when autophagy is induced. Thus, p62 may be used as a marker to study autophagic flux. Here, p62 levels accumulated within 36 h after treatment, suggesting an inhibition of autophagic degradation (Figure 1F). Once formed, autophagosomes must reach lysosomes to fuse with them for the degradation of the contents[26]. Here, the localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes was fur - ther monitored in GFP-LC3 (autophagosome marker) and RFP-LAMP1 (lysosomal marker) co-transfected cells. The co- localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes was blocked in physalin B-treated cells as shown in Figure 2A. As reported, microtubules appear to be essential for the delivery of autophagosomes to lysosomes for autophagosome/lysosome fusion[27]. In addition, the F-actin network has also been found to stimulate autophagosome/lysosome fusion and substrate degradation[28]. We also evaluated the status of microtubules and F-actin. As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, microtubules and F-actin microfilaments were altered, which may be involved in the blockage of autophagosome/lysosome fusion and conse -quent B-induced autophagy and apoptosis Western blot analysis was used to detect the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK. As shown in Fig - the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK were increased in a time- and dose- dependent man - ner, indicating a sustained activation of the ERK1/2, JNK, and p62 accumulation (Fig - ure 3B), suggesting that the ERK, p38, and JNK Physalin B induces mito-ROS production Previous studies have reported that mitochondrial ROS plays an important role in autophagy[29]. MitoSOX staining was per - formed to detect whether physalin B could induce mito-ROS. As Figure 4 shows, physalin B induced mito-ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner as early as 4 h after treatment. The ROS scavenger NAC effectively reversed the generation Figure 2.

Cells were treated with 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B, 0.1% DMSO (negative control) and 100 ng/mL nocodazole (positive control) for 12 h. Samples were then prepared as mentioned in the \"Materials and methods\" section, and the status of microtubules was observed using an Olympus confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). (C) F-actin microfilaments were changed in physalin B-treated cells. Cells were treated with 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B, 0.1% DMSO (negative control) and 5 \u00b5mol/L rapamycin for 12 h. Samples were then prepared as mentioned in the \"Materials and methods\" section, and the status of F-actin microfilaments was observed using an Olympus confocal microscope (Olympus, 522 www.nature.com/aps Ma YM et al Acta Pharmacologica Sinicanpg of ROS (Figure 4). ROS scavenger NAC reverses UPP inhibition and incomplete autophagic response To evaluate the role of mito-ROS generation in the anticancer effect of physalin B, NAC was used to eliminate mito-ROS in physalin B-treated cells. The effect of mito-ROS formation, cytoskeletal changes, the MAPK pathways, apoptosis, and cellular viability was evaluated. Here, NAC treatment effectively reduced physalin B-induced mito-ROS (Figure 4). The elimination of ROS upon NAC treatment could abrogate UPP inhibition as the poly- ubiquitin level was significantly downregulated (Figure 5A). Mito-ROS elimination reversed the incomplete autophagic response as demonstrated by the increased colocalization of autophagosomes and lysosomes (Figure 5B) and decreased p62 levels (Figure 5E). Changes in microtubules and F-actin microfilaments were also reversed upon NAC treatment, sug - gesting that autophagosome/lysosome fusion process was recovered (Figure 5C and 5D). We also investigated the role of ROS in MAPK pathway activation, which has a close rela - tionship with apoptosis and autophagy. As shown in Figure 5E, the phosphorylation levels of ERK, p38, and JNK were reduced effectively upon NAC treatment, indicating that MAPK pathways were activated via ROS generation. Apop - tosis and impaired viability induced by physalin B can also be reversed upon ROS elimination (Figure 5F-5H), indicating that the anticancer activity of physalin B relied on ROS genera - tion. Discussion The UPP is a major degradation system for short-lived pro - teins[30]. Proteins destined for degradation through the UPP are labeled with ubiquitin and then degraded by the 26S proteasome complex. Precise elimination of these proteins is critical to the accurate regulation of intracellular signaling pathways involved in multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and cell death.Figure 3. ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK were activated in physalin B-treated cells. (A) Cells were treated with 2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B. Samples were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 h, separately. Levels of phosphor-ERK, ERK, phosphor-JNK, JNK, phosphor-p38 MAPK, detected using Western blotting assay. (B) Cells were treated with 10 \u00b5mol/L physalin B or using Western blotting Ma YM et al Acta Pharmacologica Sinicanpg The ALP is another major intracellular degradation system, which is mainly responsible for the degradation of long-lived proteins and other cellular contents[31]. Autophagy is stimu - lated by multiple signals, including nutrient deprivation, oxi - dative stress, hypoxia, DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticu - lum stress. This dynamic process involves autophagosome formation and fusion with lysosomes, followed by lysosomal degradation of the intra-autophagosomal contents. Increasing evidence has demonstrated the crosstalk between the UPP and ALP. For example, upon the inhibition of the UPP, cells activate ALP to facilitate autophagolysosomal pro - tein turnover[14]. Additionally, ALP via excess p62/SQSTM1 accu - mulation, which leads to an inhibition of the clearance of ubiq - uitinated proteins designated for proteasomal degradation by delaying their delivery to the proteases of the proteasome[32]. The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is toxic and can induce apoptosis. Here, physalin B inhibited the UPP and ALP, followed by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, thus accelerating apoptotic cell death. The natural compound physalin B has been reported as an indirect UPP inhibitor[13]. The effect of physalin B on the ALP was investigated here. LC3 exists in two forms, LC3-I and its proteolytic derivative LC3-II. LC3-I is localized in the cyto - plasm and LC3-II is localized in autophagosomal membranes. the of the C-terminal LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form II, which is targeted rapidly to autophagic membranes. Simi - larly, the GFP-LC3 fusion protein, which is in a diffuse pattern (cytoplasmic and nuclear), redistributes to a vacuolar pattern when autophagic vacuoles are formed[33]. The abundance of LC3-II is closely related with autophagosome quantity and can be used as a reliable indicator of autophagosome presence[34]. p62/SQSTM1 is an ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein that is degraded by autophagy and may be probed as a marker for the induction of autophagy, clearance of protein aggregates, and the inhibition of autophagy[35]. Physalin B induced the formation of autophagosomes and upregulation of LC3-II, indicating the initiation of autophagy. Beclin 1, the mamma - lian ortholog of yeast Atg6/Vps30, is a canonical autophagy marker that has a central role in canonical autophagy. During the canonical autophagic process, Beclin 1 is important for the localization of autophagic proteins to a pre-autophagosomal structure[36]. The expression level of Beclin 1 is upregulated during canonical autophagy[37-39]. When apoptosis occurs is cleaved by caspase-3, gener - ating fragments that lose to induce autophagy[40]. Here, non-canonical Beclin 1-independent autophagy was initiated in physalin B-treated cells. After treatment with phy - salin B for 9 h, the protein levels of LC3-II and p62 increased, whereas the protein level of Beclin 1 was not upregulated compared with the control group, indicating that the initiation of the autophagy response was not dependent on Beclin 1. After a 12 h treatment, caspase-3 was activated and the expres - sion level of Beclin 1 was reduced, suggesting that Beclin 1 was cleaved by caspase-3 and its pro-autophagic activity was lost. The ALP can also be induced by nutrient starvation in eukaryotic cells, which is largely due to the inhibition of TOR (target of rapamycin)[41]. mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase that balances diverse anabolic processes such as cell proliferation, cell survival, and protein synthesis, plays a vital role at the interface of the pathways that coordinately regu - late the balance between cell growth and autophagy[42]. Here, autophagosomes were observed after a 12 h treatment with - out a reduction in the phosphorylation of mTOR at the serine 2448, a key determinant of mTOR activity[43], suggesting that the initiation of autophagy is mTOR-independent. Further investigation showed a blockage during the late degradation stage of autophagy in physalin B-treated cells. LC3-II and p62, which should be degraded through the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes during the late stage of autophagy, were not degraded but rather accumulated within a 36 h treatment. This result implied incomplete lysosomal degradation. Additional observation of autophagosomes and lysosomes in GFP-LC3/RFP-LAMP1 cells indi - the co-localization and fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes during late stage of autophagy. The cytoskeleton is a network of protein polymer fibrils that maintains cell shape, compartmentalization and intracellular trafficking or even whole-cell movement[44]. Microfilaments, microtubules, intermediate combine tute the cytoskeletal system. Microtubule and microfilament systems are tightly regulated to facilitate a dynamic organiza - tion and rapid remodeling of the cytoskeleton, and they play Figure 4. Physalin B induced mitochondrial ROS generation. Cells were treated for 4 h with physalin B (5 and 10 \u00b5mol/L), physalin B (10 \u00b5mol/L) with NAC (10 mmol/L), DMSO (0.1%) as negative control, H 2O2 (100 \u00b5mol/L) as positive control.

Microtu - bules facilitate autophagosome trafficking. Intact microtubules contribute to the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, which could be disrupted by microtubule-depolymerizing reagents such as nocodazole. In addition, microfilaments are also found to facilitate autophagosome/lysosome fusion and substrate degradation[45]. Here, the status of microtubules and F-actin microfilaments were altered, a possible mechanism Figure 6. A schematic model of the anticancer mechanism of physalin B in HCT116 cells. Physalin B induces mito-ROS generation resulting in UPP inhibition and incomplete non-canonical autophagy response. Autophagosome/lysosome fusion is blocked due to the inhibition of functions of microtubules and F-actin microfilaments, leading apoptosis.

Interestingly, He et al found that physalin A induced Beclin 1-dependent autophagy, which a Beclin 1-independent autophagic response. As previously reported, ROS-induced activation of ERK and JNK simultaneously induce non-canonical autophagy and apop-tosis in cancer cells [47]. Here, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK were activated via ROS generation. The inhibition of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, separately, partially reversed cleavage and the apoptosis and a autophagic response. In addition, an increase of mito-ROS was observed. As reported, ROS could impact many different cellular pro-cesses [48], including the inhibition of the UPP[49], induction cytoskeleton rearrangement[51], and activation of the MAPK pathways[52]. The ROS scavenger NAC effectively reversed ubiquitinated protein accumulation, autophagosome formation, and cyto- skeletal network changes, indicating that UPP inhibition and the incomplete autophagic response depended on ROS gen- eration. NAC treatment also reversed MAPK pathway activa- tion, apoptosis and cell viability inhibition. In conclusion, our findings reveal the antitumor mechanism of physalin B in HCT116 cells: mito-ROS induction by physa-lin B an incomplete non-canon - ical autophagy response. The incompletion of autophagic degradation might be due to changes in the microtubules and F-actin network, followed by a blockage of autophagosome/lysosome fusion. Physalin B induces sustained activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways, which partially mediates an incomplete autophagic response and apoptosis (Figure 6). Here we report that physalin B is not only a UPP inhibi- tor but also an inducer of an incomplete autophagic response via mito-ROS generation. Because the UPP and ALP are two important potential targets for anticancer therapy, the discov - ery and mechanistic study of the natural compound physalin B with a novel mode of action provides important knowledge for potent anticancer drug discovery and serum .
