One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Evaluate the role of two complementary therapies in contemporary society. - D1 The term complementary medicine is used by conventional medical practitioners to refer to nom-invasive, non-pharmaceutical techniques which are used in conjunction with allopathic medical treatments such as drugs and surgery. The term implies that sometimes conventional medicine is used as a primary tool and also a non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical complementary technique is used as a supplement when needed. Complementary medicine has become an increasing feature of healthcare I have integrated various holistic practices into my treatment plans including acupuncture, yoga, massage, meditation and prayer. I also discuss and recommend the importance of balance in our lives, which is a major philosophy of Ayurvedic Medicine, \"balance between body, mind and spirit\" (What is the philosophy, n.d.). I stress how healthy choices regarding diet, exercise and relationships can impact a patient's physical, emotional and spiritual balance in their life. In modern medicine, alternative therapies are poorly understood and studied. The preference for alternative therapies, and herbal medicine were indicated, and the fear of relinquishing information regarding these practices were almost paralyzing. It seemed as though they were ashamed to admit to cultural healing practices, and did not divulge information to practitioners regarding their usage. The cultural disconnect was present as alternative/complimentary medicines are valued as a culture, and \"modern\" practitioners cast judgment on their usage. This perceived stigma additionally limited the information shared by the cultural participants with modern medical treatments, potentially causing additional harm, as some herbals are potentially toxic. Traditional medicine is regarded as a viable alternative to Western medicine especially among the uninsured and undocumented. It is generally not seen as conflicting with Western medicine among patients and traditional healers. In terms of health awareness, pressures of work and lack of income and time. Eastern vs Western Medicine When the average American catches a cold, they head to their doctor who assesses their condition and prescribes medication to help alleviate their symptoms. The patient then heads to the pharmacy, gets their medicine, starts a course of treatment, and eventually feels better. That is the average cycle of treatment in our society. Someone suffering from a headache will take a painkiller; for a cough, cough syrup; and for a stuffy nose, a decongestant. In the western part of the world, illness is treated with medicine, or more specifically, scientific medicine. At the core of modern western medicine is Germ Theory, which states that certain microorganisms can cause disease (Ritter & Graham, 2017). If someone Native American Medicine \"Native American medicine is based on widely held beliefs about healthy living, the repercussions of disease-producing behavior, and the spiritual principles that restore balance.\" -Ken \"Bear Hawk\" Cohen (Chrisman 1). Holistic Healing Argumentative Dr. James Marcum, a cardiologist at the Chattanooga Heart Institute in Tennessee claims, \"Pharmaceutical drugs don't heal people.\" In fact, he states, \"Much of the time they do more harm than good\"(Milner). U.S. Citizens need to stop taking harmful pills and start using more natural, holistic healing methods. Everyone has probably used a pill before to relieve their pain, but there are healthier ways to feel just as good. According to the results of the National Health Interview Survey, \"In 2012, 33.2% of U.S. adults used complementary health approaches\"(What Complementary and Integrative Approaches Do Americans Use?). While some people believe conventional medicine is a better choice, it is clear that holistic healing can replace prescription drugs because they are more safe and effective than prescription drugs, and they are more practical in many ways. Health Models An Overview Before the advent of microscopes and the technology to see the very small, many people thought that illness was caused by divine intervention, lack of faith, or random and unexplained \"vapors\" or smells. For the most part, there was no understanding that certain organisms caused anything; in fact, while it seems ridiculous to us now, we must remember that for hundreds of years, even many historical figures believed in using leeches or draining blood to help heal the body (Kennedy, 2004, pp. 3-11). After the discovery of bacteria and the use of the microscope, the \"Bio-Medical Model\" (BMM) moved into prominence, believing that specific illness were linked to specific bacteria, viruses, or pathogens. Many of the more common diseases that killed so many in history were mitigated by using the BMM: measles, chicken pox, tuberculosis, etc. Still, many questions even into the 20th century seemed to not really fit with this pathogen-based model (Porter, 1999). For most of the West, the idea of categorizing everything came out of the Enlightenment and was expressed as a \"germ\" model. The European mind could then find, define, analyze and kill the germ therefore healing the person. In fact, the whole idea of vaccination came out of this model, and changed the health of society (James, 1992). Alternative Therapy: Doll Therapy Alternative Medicine is defined as any practice that is not included in traditional medicine care. There are various reasons why hospitals or health care settings include alternative medicine. Some health care facilities are experimenting with different therapies to advance the health care system. One therapy that has been proven to have positive results is the doll therapy for patients with dementia. In \"Doll therapy: Therapeutic or Childish and Inappropriate?\", doll therapy is examined and the ethicality of the medicine is discussed. The qualitative experiment carried out in the article shows the ways that patients, families, and staff feel about using dolls in the care plan of dementia patients. The authors, Julia Heathcote, and Moira Clare, hypothesize that the dolls are positive ways to increase patients' wellbeing because the dolls encourage a childish happiness for many clients (Heathcoat & Clare, 2014). CAM Therapeutic Modalities Florence Gray SCI 201 October 18, 2010 Phil Bellefeuille CAM Therapeutic Modalities The following paper will define alternative medicine, complementary medicine, and integrative medicine. It will describe how conventional medicine plays a role in these three terms. In addition, it will review the philosophy of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and how it is different from conventional Western medicine and a description of the five domains of therapy. Finally, it will show how CAM treatment modality Ayurveda is used as an alternative therapy and a complementary therapy for obesity. Holistic Medicine Most people in the US usually treat their medical problems with prescription drugs, but there are alternative ways to relieve their physical pain. The health care system is making billions of dollars in researching new drugs to treat medical conditions and takes many years of research to find an effective way. Medical professionals have to consider the risk of trying new drugs on patients such as clinical trials to reduce heart disease or other conditions. However, there are other methods that are natural treatments for patients and may be less expensive. This is called holistic medicine can be a successful and a natural way to treat medical conditions in the U.S. by holistic doctors. According to Melinda Ratini, DO, MS Over many years, society has explored options into different varieties and forms of medicine to help people with pain along with other treatment options not prescribed by mainstream medicine. Some options of alternative medicine consist of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, herbal medicine, meditation, massage, aromatherapy, hypnosis, and other medicines not prescribed Basically, we have two choices to make when we develop a condition or disease: Treatment or Detoxification. If we choose treatment, we have two additional choices. The first choice is allopathic (pharmaceutical) medicine, which is the status-quo medical or chemical approach. The second choice is natural (traditional) medicine, which uses products made from natural sources or herbs to treat the symptoms. If we choose the allopathic approach to \"fight\" our disease, it is important to understand that allopathic medicine offers only three types of treatment for any condition: chemical medicines, radiation or surgery. Pharmaceutical companies spend a lot of money developing drugs and training medical (allopathic) doctors in how to use these "}
