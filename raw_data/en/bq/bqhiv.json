It makes use of the best of conventional and alternative medicine, to provide care that is responsive to the needs and health of individual patients. This requires the patient, the patient's primary care provider, and the Integrative physician to work together as a team. It may also include referrals to other health care providers which include Complementary and Alternative Medicine practitioners outside of the MMP practice, if this is found to be in the patient's best interests. This approach may be appropriate for patients who want to focus on preventing illness and taking charge of their health, as well as patients who have been diagnosed with a new problem, or a condition that has not improved with conventional medical care alone, and would like to explore other options. What to expect during an Integrative Medicine visit: - First visits are typically about 50 - 60 minutes. A thorough medical and social history is taken and treatment options are discussed.
