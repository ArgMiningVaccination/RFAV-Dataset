The concept of an epidemic is described in Charaka Samhita, the big treatise of Ayurveda as \"... even though there is dissimilarity in the physical constitution of human beings, still there are such factors which are common to all individuals and disturbance of these factors leads to the concurrent display of diseases having the same set of symptoms leading to the destruction of countries. Factors which are common for all the inhabitants of a country are air, water, location and seasons.\" Epidemic is a situation where the environment - air, water, land and seasons - is disturbed, causing a concurrent display of a disease among large populations (epidemic), destroying human habitations. Ayurvedic ways of boosting immunity Charaka Samhita says that immunity as the ability to prevent and arrest the progression of disease to maintain homeostasis. Ayurveda pays larger emphasis on strengthening the mind and body to cope with various stressors, including infection. Like innate and acquired immunity, the Ayurvedic concept of immunity (Bala or strength) is classified as natural (Sahaja), chronobiologic (Kalaja), and acquired (Yuktikrut). In Ayurveda, numerous treatment options are available for enhancing immunity against respiratory illnesses, these include certain immunomodulators (known as Rasayana), local and systemic intrusions. Local prophylaxis measures such as herbal decoctions, consumptions of hot water, gargling with medicated water, and steam inhalation described in Ayurveda for respiratory illnesses. This is evident that such traditional measures can positively influence mental health and immune function through modulating psycho-neuroimmune pathways. A few effective home remedies Here, we reveal a few home remedies that are very effective in strengthening the immune system. - Drink a glass of milk with 1 teaspoon of turmeric at night before going to bed. Turmeric has potent antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. - Have 1 teaspoon of ginger paste or juice with honey. This anti-inflammatory concoction will stimulate your taste buds and prevent cold and mucus buildup. - Gargle with hot water and salt twice daily to keep your oral cavity clean and free from any mucus accumulation. - Decoction made with cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, dry ginger with honey is beneficial for cold and throat infection.
