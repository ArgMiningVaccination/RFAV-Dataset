A systematic review was conducted to assess the level of evidence for integrative health care research. We searched PubMed, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), BIOSIS Previews, EMBASE, the entire Cochrane Library, MANTIS, Sci, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and NCCAM grantee publications listings, from database inception to May 2009, aswell as searches of the \"gray literature.\" Available studies published in English language were included. Three independent reviewers rated each article and assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN 50). Our search yielded 11,891 total citations but 6 clinical studies, including 4 randomized, met our inclusion criteria. Thereare no available systematic reviews/meta-analyses published that met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed independently using quality checklists of the SIGN 50. Only a small number of RCTs and CCTs with a limited number of patients and lack of adequate control groups assessing integrative health care research are available. Thesestudies provide limited evidence of e ective integrative health care on some modalities. However, integrative health care regimen appears to be generally safe. 1. Introduction In the United States, \"institutional integrative health care (aka integrative medicine) is being developed in a highlyindividualistic manner (page 3)\" [ 1]. Much of this literature refers to integrating CAM into institutional health systemsand involves bringing CAM providers into conventionalhealth centers [ 2]. However, there is another approach to integrative health care emerging within the CAM communityitself, the insurance industry and with what is termed by onewriter as the \"CAM entrepreneurs\" [ 2,3]. There are various denitions and a diversity of terminol- ogy of integrative health care [ 4]. Maizes dene the term\"integrative medicine\" as \"medicine that reemphasizes the relationship between patient and physician, and integratesthe best of complementary and alternative medicine withthe best of conventional medicine\" [ 5]. Boon et al.'s [ 4] study on working denition for integrative health caredenes \"integrative health care\" as the combination of aninterdisciplinary, nonhierarchical blending of both CAM andconventional medicine that employs a collaborative teamapproach guided by consensus building, mutual respect,and a shared vision of health through a partnership of patient and practitioners to treat the whole person by synergistically combining therapies and services in a mannerthat exceeds the collective e ect of the individual practice2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine [4]. Interestingly, at the prestigious IOM conference on integrative health care no formal denition emerged [ 6]. Therefore, the denition of integrative health care can range from simply incorporating CAM into conventionalmedicine to the notion that integrative health care con-stitutes a new form of medical practice. Stumpf, Shapiro, and Hardy refer to the malleable denitions of integrative health care as \"one rst step towards understanding thephenomenon.\" However, a denition is more likely toemerge from key issues that are shaping the future ofintegrative medicine. That is, bilateral integrative medicinemore resembles assimilation of CAM by biomedicine thantrue acculturation [ 7]. It seems that regardless of the denitions, health care practitioners and policy makers have increasingly recognizedthat patients are using integrative health care to improve theirwellness and treat illness [ 8]. Thus, for this paper, a guiding principle to the denition of integrative health care research is the study of the incorporation of CAM with biomedicine as acollaborative and integral part of the health care system. Thatis, the integration of conventional (allopathic) medicine andCAM, involving shared management of the patient, sharedpatient care, shared practice guidelines, and shared commonvalues and goals to treat the well-being of the whole person. There is preliminary theoretical and empirical data to support that integrative health care is not equivalent toCAM [ 9,10]. However, the diversity of denitions, the ranges in levels of integration, and the degree of integrationbetween CAM and biomedicine poses challenges to thepractice, research, education, and policy/guideline decision and development in this evolving eld. We posit that incorporation of CAM into conventional medicine without a joint management does not constituteintegrative health care. In fact, the use of CAM as anadjunctive treatment to conventional care without a unifyingparadigm or joint management may lead to worse outcomesbecause the selected CAM modality may adversely interactwith conventional modality, and vice versa. In essence,integrative health care combines the best products andpractices of CAM and conventional health care to optimizethe body's natural healing processes [ 5,11]. The purpose of this paper is to review and summa- rize literature on Randomized controlled trial (RCT) andControlled clinical (CCT), and systematic reviewson integrative health care as dened above and to makerecommendations for future research on this topic. 2. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review using a web-based, secure, systematic review management program calledTrialStat SRS 4.0 (c/circlecopyrtCopyright 2003-2009 Mobius Analytics Inc, Ottawa, Ontario). TrialStat automates article progres-sion and management, eliminates data transcription andreduces data collation work at the end of a review. Thisapproach di ers from conventional systematic literature review because it allows researchers to deliver results fasterwith improved accuracy and quality, providing a completeaudit trail of all changes made in the systematic review. We searched the following databases from 1965 to Sept 2007:Pubmed, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED),BIOSIS Previews, EMBASE, the entire Library,MANTIS, Psych-Info, CINAHL, and NCCAM grantee publications listings. For the initial search, gray literature was searched using ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and Google ScholarFrom our search strategy the keywords are identied inTable 3 . An updated secondary search was conducted in May 2009 during manuscript development to insure that all articlesmeeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria using the originalsearch terms were included. In addition, hand searches andreference tracking were also performed, and the citation listwas assessed for comprehensiveness by content experts. 2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Our initial search terms were Integrat and Medicine; Integratand Health (for healthcare); multidisciplinary and conventional medicine or health care; anddelivery of health care and integrat . Three investigators (RK, IC, and AH) independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance based on theinclusion criteria for this paper. Any disagreements aboutincluding a study were resolved through discussion andconsensus. T o avoid any misinterpretation, we excludedarticles in languages other than English. This paper reports only on the RCT's, CCTs, and meta- analysis that passed our second level review screening. How-ever, we have collected articles on practice models, models ofintegration, program evaluation, observational studies, cost-eectiveness, healthcare utilization, and so forth, which will be reported at a future date. The initial search retrieved allthe above articles which were coded into their respectivecategories of study design. These were included in thebibliography but excluded from formal evaluation in thispaper (see Figure 1 ). Articles were included in this paper if they met the following criteria: (1) involved human subjects; (2) clinicalstudy designs, including clinical controlled trials (includingRCTs) and systematic reviews or meta-analysis involvedwith integrative health care research; and (3) integrativehealth care treatment as dened by the authors of thispaper (including at least one modality from CAM andone modality from conventional medicine and they are combined using an integrative healthcare paradigm). We limited studies to those published in the English language.We also excluded studies with one of the following criteria:(1) did not present original data or an analysis of origi-nal data (i.e., commentaries, editorials, or expert opinionpieces); (2) were published in other media or in incompleteformats (i.e., abstracts, conference proceedings, posters, orweb postings); (3) exclusively CAM without integrationwith conventional medicine; (4) use of CAM as adjunctivetherapy to conventional medicine without incorporatingan integrative health care paradigm in the design of thestudy; (5) studies that tested herbs and supplements; and (6)not applicable to Western health care setting.

This paper did not involve human or nonhuman experi- mentation and was exempt from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 2.2. Methodological Assessment Process and Quality Rating. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed independently by the reviewers (RK, IC, and AH). Each article was evaluated by type of study design and quality.RCTs, CCTs and meta-analysis were evaluated for study quality and study design bias using the Scottish Intercol-legiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklists [ 12,13] (see Table 1 ). Also, there were independent assessments of the quality of the studies selected, and data extraction compriseddescriptive information of the study population, the typesof interventions, and the relevant outcome measurementsand di erences in ratings were resolved by reconciliation, discussion, and consensus. The outcome measures in each article were extracted and a determination was made regard-ing the direction of evidence for each study as strong, mixed,weak, or inconclusive (see Table 4 ). Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) (i.e., nonrandomized, pilot, single group, and othersmall studies) were qualitatively discussed in this paperregarding outcomes measures and study dropouts but notformally scored for bias such as randomization and blinding(see Table 4 ). To t a l e ect size was not calculated due to the hetero- geneity of the trials identied during the review phase. Allassessments were based on information provided in thepublished manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 1: SIGN checklist [ 1]. Section 1: Internal validity Item Description 1.1 Study addresses appropriate, clearly focused question. 1.2 Treatment group assignment is randomized.1.3 Adequate concealment method is used.1.4 Subjects and investigators are kept \"blind\" about treatment allocation. 1.5 Treatment and control groups are similar at the start of the trial. 1.6 Only di erence between groups is the treatment under investigation. 1.7 Outcomes are measured in a standard, valid, and reliable way.1.8 What percentage of subjects in each treatment arm dropped out before the study was completed (i.e., record %)?1.9 All subjects are analyzed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated (intention to treat analysis). 1.10 If the study is multisite, results are comparable for all sites.

Those criteria that have not been fullled or not adequately described are thought unlikely to alter the conclusions. Few or no criteria fullled. The conclusions of the study are thought likely or very likely to alter. 2.3. Adverse Events Methodology and Reporting. Safety eval- uation and adverse events reporting in all the RCTs wereconducted using a 100 point safety assessment scale (SAS-CT) [ 14]. This scale has six major domains and the sub- domains have di erent weights according to their degree of importance and rate of occurrence. Safety evaluationand adverse events reporting in all the clinical studies wasassessed by two investigators (RK and IC) and checked forconsistency (see Table 2 for scoring information). If all information required is presented in the text, tables, or gures, full points are given. If anything had to beextrapolated or added or half information is missing, halfpoints are given. However, whether or not a conclusion canbe drawn depends on the amount of information available[15] (see Table 4 for SAS-CT scores). 3. Study Selection Our initial search yielded 11,591 citations from database inception to Sept 2007. An additional secondary search wasconducted to capture studies published from September2007-May 2009. This secondary search yielded 300 citations(see Figure 1 ).4. Results on Quality Assessment and Tr ial Homo geneit y Heterogeneity across studies (i.e., outcomes, population, and the small number of studies per therapy) precluded formalmeta-analysis. Therefore, it was only possible to conduct adescriptive analysis of the studies' design (study validity andbias) and outcomes reported. Of the 20 studies included in the qualitative synthesis, a total of 6 articles met the inclusion criteria of this paper.Of these 6 trials, there were 4 RCTs for which data wereextracted in a standardized manner, and three independentinvestigators assessed the methodologically quality of RCTs using the (SIGN) checklist (see Table 1 ).Table 4 describes the main study characteristics and summarizes the ndingsof the 4 RCTs and 2 CCTs. The studies reviewed in this papercould not be combined for a total e ect size because of the 4 RCTs, three (3) were conducted by the same research groupon the same population and heterogeneity across studies.Using the SIGN 50, three of the 4 RCTs (75%) were ratedas high quality \"++\" . was ratedas neutral \"+\" , and no RCT was rated as low quality \" \". Individual SIGN item scores are available on Table 5 .Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Table 2: SAS-CT Adverse Events Scoring. The safety assessment score for controlled clinical trials (SAS-CT) consists of six major domains. Each domain and subgroup has di erent weightings according to its degree of important and rate of occurrence. The maximum subscores of: (i) adverse events denitely not related to the intervention (AEs-NR) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are 27 points, (ii) serious adverse events denitely not related to the intervention (SAEs-NR) and serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) are 13.5 points, (iii) drop-outs due to AE/SAEs-NR and ADRs/ SADRs have a maximum subscore of 9.5 points each. T otal SAS-CT score per control clinical trial equals 100 points. Quality is based on the degree of the importance of the subdomains. The SAS-CT is separated into three quality levels:(i) poor (0 <SAS-CT <28) (ii) medium (28 <SAS-CT <68) (iii) high quality safety reporting (68 <SAS-CT <100) 5. Descriptive Results: Effects of Interventions 5.1. Clinical Trials on Multidimensional Integrative Health Care Interventions ( n=6).Six articles [ 16-21] that were clinical trials of multidimensional integrative healthcare interventions were obtained. These 6 studies includedfour RCTs on integrative health care therapies to improvecardiovascular risk and/or disease symptoms [ 16-19], and two CCTs evaluating integrative health care therapies toimprove quality of life/life satisfaction in women with breastcancer [ 20,21]. Three of these RCTs were multiple reports published from the same research team on similar topicsand populations\u2014the e cacy of Noetic therapies before percutaneous intervention for unstable coronary syndromes[16-18]. The Monitoring and Actualization of Noetic therapy (MANTRA) clinical trials [ 16-18] examined the feasibility and e cacy of applying 4 Noetic therapies\u2014stress relax- ation, imagery, touch therapy, and prayer\u2014to patients in thesetting of acute coronary interventions compared to usualcare. The results of two MANTRA trials, by Kruco et al. [ 16, 17] were not statistically signicant for any treatment out- comes comparisons. However, there was a reduction (25%-30%) in absolute incidence of major adverse cardiovascularevents (i.e., mortality, myocardial infarction, congestive heartfailure, and urgent or repeat revascularization) or adverse clinical events in patients treated with any Noetic therapies compared to usual care (control). Also, in the pilot studyof the 4 individual Noetic therapies, o -site prayer was associated with the lowest absolute mortality in-hospital andat 6 months [ 16]. The parallel randomization to 4 di erent Noetic therapies across 5 study arms limited the assessmentof possible synergy between therapies. When the same research team examined the benecial eects of Noetic therapies on mood assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (V AS) before percutaneous coronary inter-vention for unstable coronary syndromes they found that ofthe eight V AS scales on mood only one, [the V AS for worry],yielded signicant e ects ( P<. 05) in the stress management, imagery, and touch therapy groups compared to with usualtherapy [ 18].The nal RCT on an integrative health care to improve cardiovascular risk was based on multidimensional interven-tion principles [ 19]. Using a relationship-centered, mind- body approach (including mindfulness meditation, relax-ation training, stress management, motivational techniques,and health education and coaching) in supporting behaviorchange, the study reported signicant improvements in the10-year cardiovascular risk as measured by the Framingham risk score (FRS) compared to usual care [ 19]. 5.2. Two CCTs on the Choice of Care for Breast Cancer. Two nonrandomized studies, by Carlsson et al. [ 20,21], compared quality-of-life of women with breast cancer who were treated with anthroposophic therapy (ABCW) after surgery for breast cancer, an individually composed therapies consisting of natural products, Iscador, diets, art therapy, eurhythmic therapy, therapeutic massage, hydrotherapy, compared tousual care. Carlsson et al. [ 20] conducted their rst study to inves- tigate the acceptability and feasibility of an anthroposophictherapy (ABCW) after surgery for breast cancer cared tousual care. They measured the di erences in perceived quality-of-life/life satisfaction and coping strategies betweenthe women receiving ABCW on entering the CCT comparedto usual care alone. There were three primary outcomeinstruments used in this study: (1) the European orga-nization for research and treatment of cancer quality-of- life questionnaire core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), (2) the life satisfaction questionnaire (LSQ), and (3) the di erences in coping measured by the mental adjustment to cancerscale. The results found that women who choose ABCWreported lower quality-of-life and a greater psychosocialdistress compared to the women receiving usual care on allmeasures on entering the study ( P<. 05). The dropout rate was about 13% for the ABCW group and 7% forthe usual care group. The authors examined the possibilitythat perhaps the women in the ABCW group, who choosetheir individualistic care, might have been more independentpersonalities in choosing in their decision of care comparedto the usual care group. A follow-up study reported that the6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 3: Ocial keywords as entered into the databases were as follows: (i) (integrated or integrative) and medicine (ii) (integrated or integrative) and health (iii) multidisciplinary care and alternative medicine(iv) multidisciplinary care and complementary medicine(v) (complementary or alternative) and conventional and (medicine or healthcare)(vi) delivery of healthcare and (integrated or integrative) (vii) (integrated or integrative) and patient evaluation (viii) (integration and medicine) and (complementary or alternative)(ix) (complementary or alternative) and medicine and (mainstream or biomedicine or orthodox). women in ABCW group showed more passive and anxious coping on admission, but this decreased over time [ 22]. This could be one explanation for the ABCW higher dropout rate. A second study from the same team (2004) [ 21], found that women with breast cancer who participated in a 6-month CCT and 1 year follow-up reported LSQ) treatment compared tothe usual care alone. A follow-up study on the samepopulation of women found that after 5 years, there wereimprovements in overall quality of life and in emotional andsocial functioning compared to admission for the womenwho choose ABCW. For these women, improvements tookplace between admission and 1 year, but not further on [ 23]. Table 4 summarizes the methodological details and results of these clinical trials of multidimensional integrativehealth care interventions. 6. Result Summary Our initial search yielded 11,591 citations of which six (4RCTs and 2 CCTs) [ 16-21] were trials of integrative health care interventions. We found that cardiovascular healthand women's health were the two most common topics inintegrative health care research. The total average age of adultsubjects for the trial articles reviewed in this paper was 51.16years. The most recent article in this paper was published in2006, the oldest article was published in 2001. There were nostudies on integrative pediatric care. Four RCTs were scored on internal validity and method- ological bias using the SIGN checklist. Three of the 4 RCTs(75%) were rated as high quality \"++\" . One or (25%) of the RCTs was rated as neutral \"+\" , and no RCT was rated as low quality \" \" . Half (50%) of the total clinical trials included in this paper were unable to report e ectiveness of their intervention (i.e., no outcome measures as positive) despitesucient power to do so. Most of these studies reported limitations such as the lack of credible controls for a placebo e ect, inadequate assessment of long-term treatment benets, and insu cient sample size, it would be di cult to generalize these ndings. Two studies failed to report information on adverse eventsas required to be presented in the manuscript text, tables, orgures, and therefore scored 0 on the SAS-CT (see Tables 4 and5).7. Discussion Two major conclusions can be drawn from this paper. The rst is that there is an increasing, and somewhatextensive, body of literature with key terms Integrat and Health(for healthcare); andconventional health care; and delivery of healthcare and integrat . This search found over 10,000 articles. However, a second conclusion is that there are very few clinical controlled trials testing the e cacy of integrative health care. The large number of articles that were notrelevant to our paper included studies on combining con- ventional services and alternative modalities without the incorporation of a collaborative and integral partnership ofan integrated health care system. That is, the integrationof conventional (allopathic) medicine and CAM, involvingshared management of the patient, shared patient care,shared practice guidelines, and shared common values andgoals to treat the well-being of the whole person. We foundthat the lack of a taxonomy makes searching this eld verydicult. This might reflect that this research topic is an emerging eld. Like any emerging eld integrative health care faces theproblem of how to dene and operationalize itself. That is,transforming the concepts into empirical and measurableen-tities. According to Maizes and Caspi, Integrative HealthCare \"requires a shift from the \"xing\" paradigm that hasbeen central to biomedicine (page 148)\" . More importantly,it \"shifts the paradigm from sickness to health, keeps thepatient in the central focus of care, and multiplies thenumber of strategies available to the patient. It is a new kindof medicine that shifts the experience for both patient andprovider (page 148)\" [ 24]. Some have described Integrative Health Care as a trans- formative process [ 9,25]. Mulkins's and Verhoef's study to identify factors for those patients who seek Integrative Health Care found 4 dimensions of transformation: (1) having access to a range of appropriate therapies to supportindividual journeys, (2) care that focuses on one's overallwell being, (3) control over disease management, and(4) developing healing relationships with care providers[25]. Bell et al. also dene Integrative Health Care as a transformative system represented by a higher-order systemof systems of care that emphasizes wellness and healing ofthe entire person (bio-psycho-socio-spiritual dimensions)Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 Table 4: Descriptive of clinical trials of choice of care (multidimensional) integrative healthcare interventions ( n=7).

While other proposed a continuum for team-oriented health care practice startingfrom the nonintegrative to fully integrative approach [ 26]. Therefore, to date noconsensus has emerged about what constitutes Integrative Health Care. While there have beenattempts to create outcome measures for Integrative HealthCare (i.e., one-item visual analogue Arizona IntegrativeOutcomes Scale (AIOS), which assesses self-rated globalsense of spiritual, social, mental, emotional, and physicalwell-being over the past 24 hours and the past month)[27] and there has been discussion on the importance of patient's perspective on integrative health care outcomes(i.e., physical well-being, change in physiological indicators,improved emotional well-being, personal transformation,feeling connected, global state of well-being, and cure)[10] none about what the important outcome variables are that must be measured. A growing body of literature documents the patient-based outcome assessment (PBOA)instruments that have been used to determine outcomes in CAM research to help practitioners and researchers makeinformed evidence-based decisions [ 28,29]. However, we were unable to indentify similar literature for IntegrativeHealth Care. Thus, the claimed inherent holistic nature ofIntegrative Health Care in which the social, psychological,spiritual, physical, and behavioral components orientedtowards support and the stimulation of healing and theachievement of wholeness (i.e., the whole system) presentspecial challenges with respect to design of clinical studiesand especially with respect to the calculation of a total e ect size. For this paper, we only reviewed clinical studies thatinvolved a blending of both CAM and conventional therapythat provides a seamless continuum of decision-making andpatient-centered care and support. However, heterogeneityacross studies made it impossible to assess a total e ect size. The lack of trials might reflect the fact that for the most part the studies are of already existing programs in which it is not possible to set up controlled trials. Researchers here are for the most part studying programs that are8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 5: Items on internal validity.

The most common situation for program evaluation is for existing programs so that we arecomparing (often retrospectively) outcomes before and afterimplementation of the program [ 31]. Lastly, the lack for trial might also reflect that controlled trials may be an inappropriate research model here and that what are required are methods for whole systems research.\"Thus, unlike biomedical research that typically examinesparts of health care and parts of the individual, one at a time,but not the complete system, integrative outcomes researchadvocates the study of the whole. The whole system includesthe patient-provider relationship, multiple conventional andCAM treatments, and the philosophical context of care asthe intervention. The systemic outcomes encompass thesimultaneous, interactive changes within the whole person(page 133)\" [ 9]. Integrative Health care clearly involves, even allowing for dierences in denition, the bringing together of di ering complex systems of care [ 32]. By their very nature, they are not systems that lend themselves very readily to the type ofresearch design required for controlled trials. In spite of the nascent state of integrative health care research on clinical trials, clinicians may be able to usethis literature review as a guideline for incorporating spe-cic types of integrative health practices that are stronglyevidence-based. There is still insu cient evidence to draw denite conclusions about the e cacy of integrative health care treatments; however, they appear to be generally safe.Available data suggest that some integrative health care therapies may warrant further study. 8. Limitations/Challenges Encountered in R e v i e w i n gt h eF i e l do fI n t e g r a t i v e Health Care It was our goal to identify only published studies having to do with integrative health care. During the initial examinationof key term and primary studies in this paper it wasdiscovered that there was no clear terminology or denitionfor integrative health care. This lack of clarity made itdicult to generate search terms for the paper. For example, IM can turn up under integrated versus integrative medicine,integrated health systems versus holistic health systems. Itmight also appear under such things as traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine. T o make sure we captured all these, the search terms by necessity had to be very broad.The downside of this strategy was that the search generated11,891 total citations. Much additional work was required,therefore, to insure that the studies were truly focused onintegrative health care. This has resulted in a level of reviewthat is not usual when reviewing citations for inclusion.Further limitations included: (1) only studies in the Englishlanguage were reviewed (2) both peer reviewed and nonpeerreviewed studies were reviewed. Nonpeer reviewed journalsare generally considered of being lower quality. The two major limitations however are that we focused on clinical studies and only those that can be termedintegrative health care as dened here. As noted earlier, this excluded most of the eld. However, it is important to showthat in the case of the strongest designs (i.e., RCTs and CCTs)and were it really is integrative, the eld at the moment isvery small. 9. Conclusions There is still insu cient evidence from trials to strongly support the higher e cacy of integrative medicine regimen compared with usual care. However, integrative healthcare regimen appears to be generally safe. Additional highquality RCTs and CCTs are therefore needed to build astronger evidence-based body of knowledge. This is the samerecommendation that has been made for CAM [ 33]. Funding Sources and Conflicts of Interest No conflict of interest exists for any of the authors of this study.
