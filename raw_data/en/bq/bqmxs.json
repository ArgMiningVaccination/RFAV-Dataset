My name is Brandy Falcon. I'm an acupuncturist, energy healer, and shamanic healer in Belmont, CA and I want to share my passion for natural healing with you! Twenty years ago, I made the biggest shift my life that propelled me along my wellness journey. I was in a very financially stable job as a Biotech Researcher. It wasn't enough to keep me happy though. I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown. I was experiencing sleep issues and physical tension. Feelings of shame started to grow in my heart everyday and I was working to create popular household products that added to the toxic soup Americans are now swimming in. I had to stop & ask myself, why did I study Biology in the first place? It was because I loved life. I loved the beauty of the Earth. And I was intrigued about the mystery that animates all living creatures. I needed to reconnect with God & Nature and remove myself from this industrial system I didn't believe in. 180 Degree Turn to Holistic Health & The Healing Arts While I was still working in the lab, I tried to find balance in my life by exploring natural health modalities. I became a Certified Massage Therapist in 2000. I enjoyed it, but knew it wasn't my main calling. Around the same time, I started to practice Yoga and fell in love immediately. The philosophy of Yoga which, similar to Biology, is all about life. I was lucky to begin with a deep, heart-felt practice through The Center for Spiritual Enlightenment. I completed 2 Yoga teacher trainings over the next few years: Yoga Educational Seminars (YES) with Joyce Anue and several talented Bay Area instructors in 2002 and a Yin Yoga teacher training with Sarah Powers and Paul Grilley in 2005. Sarah and Paul shared Taoist philosophy and Traditional Chinese Medicine Meridian Theory as part of their Yin Training practice, which I loved so much and started adopting myself. I finally left Biotech to get my Masters Degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2006. I knew integrating everything I'd previously done would make me a well-rounded practitioner. How did I know I was on the right path? Everything in my life - health, relationships, competency of my skills, etc. - fell into place. When I graduated in 2009 I was a newlywed and also a few months pregnant. After having my son, it became clear that raising this boy to be a highly functioning, compassionate young man would be the most important job I could ever do. It took some time to integrate my healing work into our lives. He's now a teenager and my priorities have shifted again to becoming an authority in the healing arts for my community. My Life Today & How We Can Work Together I am so grateful every day to have a life I love. I've managed to create a work-life balance that suits my family and clients well. These days, I'm focused on empowering women and helping them find balance and resolution to the energetic, emotional, and spiritual roots of their health issues. Through Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, Ahai 7D Energy Healing & Shamanic Healing, in addition to Ear Seeds, Essential Oils, and other Natural Health Tools I have, I'm able to help women heal their lives, not just their bodies. I love that I can do this both in-person at my office in Belmont, CA as well as remotely over video (all except acupuncture and hands-on work).
