Despite being an essential part of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP), few studies assess Doctors of Chiropractic (DCs) clinical opinions and experience regarding the utilization of (PROTS) in practice. In this study, DCs were surveyed regarding utilization of PROTS in practice. The survey was administered to an estimated 50,000 licensed DCs by email. A total of 4301 surveys were completed, of which 3641 were United States (US) DCs. The Clinician Opinion and Experience on Chiropractic Radiography (COECR) scale was designed to analyze survey responses. This valid and reliable scale demonstrated good internal consistency using confirmatory factor analysis and the Rasch model. Survey responses show that 73.3% of respondents utilize PROTS in practice and 26.7% refer patients out for PROTS. Survey responses show that, among US DCs, 91.9% indicate PROTS has value beyond identification of pathology, 86.7% indicate that PROTS is important regarding biomechanical analysis of the spine, 82.9% indicate that PROTS is vital to practice, 67.4% indicate that PROTS aids in measuring outcomes, 98.6% indicate the opinion that PROTS presents very low to no risk to patients, and 93.0% indicate that sharing clinical findings from PROTS studies with patients is beneficial to clinical outcomes. The results of the study indicated that based on clinical experience, the majority of DCs find PROTS to be vital to practice and valuable beyond the identification of red flags.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-10", "cleaned_text": "Examining Clinical Opinion and Experience Regarding Utilization of Plain Radiography of the Spine: Evidence from Surveying the Chiropractic Profession [https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12062169](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12062169) [Spine Rehabilitation in 2022 and Beyond](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm/special_issues/WB57SSGGE8)) Abstract [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B4-jcm-12-02169)], non-pharmaceutical, non-surgical approaches to musculoskeletal conditions that to reduce opioid usage [ [5](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B5-jcm-12-02169), [6](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B6-jcm-12-02169), [7](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B7-jcm-12-02169), [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B8-jcm-12-02169)] and decrease and disability [ [11](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B11-jcm-12-02169), [12](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B12-jcm-12-02169), [13](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B13-jcm-12-02169)] when compared to other therapies. Research shows that when a patient sees a DC first after a low back injury, surgical intervention is reduced to 1.5% compared to 42.7% when initially evaluated by a surgeon even after considering other important variables [ [9](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B9-jcm-12-02169)]. Additionally, chiropractic intervention has been shown to reduce opioid usage by 56% [ [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B8-jcm-12-02169)], and a survey taken in 2012 found \"over 96% respondents with spine-related problems who reported the use of chiropractic manipulation stated that the therapy helped them with their condition\" [ [14](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B14-jcm-12-02169)]. While there are many different methodologies utilized within chiropractic to determine care, plain radiography has a long history of utilization by the profession as a viable tool in assessing spinal dysfunction [ [15](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B15-jcm-12-02169)]. Current chiropractic scope of practice, while varied from state to state, allows DCs to order, perform, and interpret radiographs for various reasons including the evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders, red flags, biomechanical analysis and to aid in patient management [ [16](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B16-jcm-12-02169)]. [17](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B17-jcm-12-02169)]. PROTS has limited ability to detect soft tissue injury, may lead to unnecessary procedures due to incidental findings and only produces single, flat images that lack detailed views of three-dimensional structures [ [18](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B18-jcm-12-02169)]. Despite recognized value, there is debate within the literature regarding red flags [ [19](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B19-jcm-12-02169), [20](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B20-jcm-12-02169)], pathology, safety [ [21](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B21-jcm-12-02169)], [23](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B23-jcm-12-02169), [24](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B24-jcm-12-02169), [25](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B25-jcm-12-02169), [26](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B26-jcm-12-02169), [27](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B27-jcm-12-02169)]. These debates have led to diametrically opposing viewpoints within the chiropractic profession on the risks, ethics and economics of ionizing radiation exposure, as well as the value PROTS provides in cases of mechanical spine pain. As a result, there are efforts to alter clinical guidelines regarding PROTS suggesting plain radiography be limited to only red flags (history of recent trauma, infection, cancer, failure to respond to treatment, neurological deficits, chronicity, etc.) [ [28](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B28-jcm-12-02169)], as well as guidelines suggesting PROTS should be expanded for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the biomechanical components of the spine in addition to red flags [ [29](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B29-jcm-12-02169)]. Currently, individual interpretation and implementation of clinical research have created diversity in clinical opinions regarding PROTS, leading to different clinical experiences throughout the chiropractic profession, which to date have not been explored. [30](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B30-jcm-12-02169)] and has rapidly gained acceptance in the developed world [ [31](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B31-jcm-12-02169)]. The EBP model requires the integration of three factors: robust research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values [ [32](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B32-jcm-12-02169), [33](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B33-jcm-12-02169)]. A doctor's clinical opinion, experience, and expertise, including the knowledge, judgment, and critical reasoning acquired through training and professional experience, are essential for implementing evidence-based practices [ [32](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B32-jcm-12-02169), [33](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B33-jcm-12-02169)]. Despite evidence supporting chiropractic care for mechanical spine pain, there is limited research regarding DCs' clinical opinion and experience regarding the utilization of PROTS, which may be of value in the management of mechanical spine pain. [34](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B34-jcm-12-02169)]. The report states that 47% of respondents took radiographs in their office and that 56.2% of their patients were radiographed. The 53% that did not take radiographs in their office referred 21.9% of their patients out for radiographs. Additionally, DCs that relied on radiographs were asked the frequency at which they performed or referred out for radiographs, as well as for repeat or follow-up radiographs to monitor patient progress or response to care (61.3%); to identify or rule out fracture, dislocation, and other pathology (94.1%); and to review for the possible presence of spinal displacements and (or) vertebral subluxation (66.8%). While this 2020 study had a large sample and included multiple questions regarding use of radiographs in chiropractic practice, the binary nature of the questions limited respondents' ability to convey the extent of their preferences regarding utilization of plain radiography. A 2021 survey suggests that the DCs' preference towards use of radiographs correlated with their view on DCs' role in healthcare; however, the limited response options and few questions related to PROTS are insufficient to conclude the comprehensive opinions and experience of DCs use of PROTS [ [35](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B35-jcm-12-02169)]. Another study from 2017 surveyed a select group of 190 members from the American Chiropractic College of Radiology, known as chiropractic radiologists, and only had 73 respondents [ [36](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B36-jcm-12-02169)]. The study is limited by the small sample size of chiropractors and possible bias from members belonging to a select organization. [28](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B28-jcm-12-02169)], is that the survey results would be heavily weighted against the utilization of PROTS and that we would see conflicting responses. 2. Materials and Methods [Appendix D](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#app4-jcm-12-02169), but these responses are not included in the analysis of this publication and will be reserved for future projects. 2.1. Survey Distribution [Appendix A](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#app1-jcm-12-02169)) on multiple occasions during a period of 18 months between 2019 and 2021. The survey was formatted using SurveyMonkey, a cloud-based software platform developed to support online survey data collection. Although sampling weights were not developed, distribution of emails by state was provided from the database source. [Appendix B](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#app2-jcm-12-02169)shows the distribution numbers and percentages based on the state of residence. [Appendix C](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#app3-jcm-12-02169). 2.2. Statistical Analyses 2.2.1. Procedures and Sample [37](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B37-jcm-12-02169)]. Additionally, by re-coding Q2 and Q10, the overlapping responses were eliminated. The remaining questions were re-coded in a way that higher values represented higher levels of the variable. Specifics about re-coding are detailed in the measures section. 2.2.2. Dependent Variable - (1) - I do NOT take radiographs in my clinic, I refer patients out to another facility (coded as 0); - (2) - I DO have an X-ray machine in my practice, but I still refer patients out to another facility for the majority of my spinal radiographs (coded as 0); - (3) - I have a plain film X-ray system in my practice and use it for the majority of my radiographs (coded as 1); - (4) - I have a DR (digital radiography) digital X-ray system in my practice and use it for the majority of my radiographs (coded as 1); - (5) - I have a CR (computed radiography) digital X-ray system in my practice and use it for the majority of my radiographs (coded as 1). 2.2.3. Predictors [Appendix D](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#app4-jcm-12-02169)provides the full list of survey questions that were used as predictors. 2.3. Clinician Opinion & Experience on Chiropractic Radiography (COECR) Scale [Table 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t001)) establish a set of items that capture the clinical opinions of practicing DCs towards using spinal radiology in chiropractic practices. In an effort to construct a new scale, this study subjected the COECR scale to psychometric evaluation by investigating internal consistency of the scale, performing confirmatory factor analysis, and specifying and testing an Item-Response Theory (IRT) model [ [38](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B38-jcm-12-02169), [39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B39-jcm-12-02169), [40](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B40-jcm-12-02169)]. 2.4. Analytic Plan [41](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B41-jcm-12-02169)] was estimated and tested using the survey data. Binary logistic regression is a regression model where the outcome is following a binomial distribution with predictors of any form including continuous, categorical, or both [ [42](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B42-jcm-12-02169)]. Preference was given to binary logistic regression due to the distribution of the dependent variable (Q7). The descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analyses were conducted in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 [ [43](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B43-jcm-12-02169)]. [44](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B44-jcm-12-02169)] to the data, we were able to evaluate the difficulty of endorsing each item included in the analysis as well as to estimate the relationship of each item with the underlying latent trait [ [45](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B45-jcm-12-02169)]. In this study, the latent trait, denoted by , is the clinical opinion towards DCs' utilization of plain radiography in chiropractic practice. 2.5. Study 1: Predicting the Use of Plain Radiography of the Spine in Chiropractic Practice [46](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B46-jcm-12-02169)]. 2.6. Study 2: COECR Scale Development and Validation [47](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B47-jcm-12-02169)] statistics was used to estimate the internal consistency of the COECR Scale. A one-factor CFA model was applied to responses Q2.1-Q-2.5 and Q10.1-Q10.5 in order to ensure the unidimensionality of the scale. Mplus 8.6 [ [48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B48-jcm-12-02169)] was used to conduct the dimensionality study. To evaluate the statistical fit of the CFA models, we used likelihood ratio tests [ [49](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B49-jcm-12-02169)], chi-square tests, and model fit indices available for latent variable modeling. Following the recommendation of Hu and Bentler [ [50](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B50-jcm-12-02169)], we used the root-mean-square error of approximation [ [51](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B51-jcm-12-02169)], the comparative fit index [ [52](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B52-jcm-12-02169)], and normed fit index [ [53](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B53-jcm-12-02169)]. Rasch Model [54](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B54-jcm-12-02169)] was selected as the framework to test the psychometric qualities of items. Two important assumptions made for IRT models are unidimensionality [ [55](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B55-jcm-12-02169)] and local independence [ [56](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B56-jcm-12-02169), [57](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B57-jcm-12-02169)]. The assumption of unidimensionality was tested with CFA. To test the assumption of local independence, Q3 statistics were estimated [ [58](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B58-jcm-12-02169)]. The Q3 statistics are pairwise residual correlations after fitting the Rasch model for every item pair on a scale. Yen [ [59](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B59-jcm-12-02169)] provided the guidance for the assessment of local independence: \"The expected value of Q3, when local independence holds, is approximately l/(n l)\" (p. 198). The Q3 statistics for COECR ranged from 0.37 to 0.26, indicating that the assumption of local independence was not violated [ [59](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B59-jcm-12-02169), [60](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B60-jcm-12-02169)]. The Rasch model was estimated and graphed in R Statistical Software using irtoys and eRm [ [61](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B61-jcm-12-02169)]. The Q3 statistics were estimated using the mirt package [ [62](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B62-jcm-12-02169)]. 3. Results 3.1. Initial Results [Table 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t002)and [Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t003)). Not all respondents responded to every question. While the survey was intended to focus on US licensed DCs, there were additional respondents from Canada and other countries. The collected data allowed for statistical analysis of US responses, comparative analysis between US and non-US DC responses, and comparative analysis between those respondents with radiographic facilities and those who lack them as described in the methods section. 3.2. Descriptive Statistics, Chi-Square, and Mean Differences [63](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B63-jcm-12-02169)]. The analysis revealed 232 cases with missing responses, which were removed from the dataset. Exclusion of cases with missing data on key variables resulted in an analytic sample of n = 4069. There were no systematic differences between the original and analysis samples. [Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t004). [Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t005)). [Table non-utilizers of plain radiography as a function of continuous variables included in the (Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8, [64](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B64-jcm-12-02169)]. [Table 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t007), DCs in the US are seven times more likely to utilize plain radiography, OR = 7.36, p < 0.01, compared to the rest of the world (outside US and Canada), while DCs practicing in Canada are three times more likely to utilize PROTS, OR = 3.17, p < 0.01. The DCs who utilized PROTS believed that: - (1) - radiographic procedures in a chiropractic office have value beyond the identification of pathology, OR = 1.54, p < 0.05 - (2) - radiographs for biomechanical procedures have significant value, OR = 1.72, p < 0.01 - (3) - radiographic procedures are vital to chiropractic care, OR = 5.93, p < 0.01 - (4) - radiographic procedures aid in the measurement of clinical outcomes, OR = 2.23, p < 0.01 - (5) - that sharing chiropractic clinical findings from radiographic studies with the patient is beneficial to their clinical outcome, OR = 1.18, p < 0.05 - (6) - biomechanical analysis or measurements of spinal alignment are valid reasons for obtaining spinal radiograph, OR = 1.4, p < 0.05 - (7) - and care plan modification consideration is a valid reason to obtain a spinal radiograph, OR = 1.57, p < 0.01. 3.4. Study 2: Scale Construction [65](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B65-jcm-12-02169), [66](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B66-jcm-12-02169)]. The item loadings ranged from 0.71 to 0.97 and were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Initially, item Q2.3 revealed negative loading on the factor, which was consistent with the previous analyses. The item was reverse coded to ensure positive loading. The CFA results are presented in [Table 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t007). [47](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B47-jcm-12-02169)]. The estimate with original coding of Q2.3 was = 0.8. There was an increase in internal consistency after recoding Q2.3: = 0.84. Both coefficients are high and in support of a unidimensional scale. Two Rasch models were specified and tested using R Statistical Software. The first model (M1) was estimated with Q2.3 being originally coded, while the second model (M2) was estimated with Q2.3 being reverse coded. The results for Rasch models are presented in [Table 6](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t006). Two types of fit statistics\u2014infit and outfit indices\u2014were estimated to assess the fit of the derived scale to the data. The infit is sensitive to unexpected responses near the item, whereas the outfit is sensitive to unexpected responses far from the item [ [67](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B67-jcm-12-02169)]. In M1, Q2.3 showed a misfit with Outfit MSQ = 12.6. In M2, the infit/outfit mean square estimates for all COECR items were within their reasonable bounds; thus, the sequence is considered stable and scalable. [Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#fig_body_display_jcm-12-02169-f001)and [Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#fig_body_display_jcm-12-02169-f002)show the item characteristic curves (ICC) for M1 and M2. The ICC is an S-shaped curve that portrays the probability of endorsing an item as a function of the latent trait. For M2, the location characteristic (item difficulty level) was higher for Q2.5 (b = 0.84) and Q10.1 (b = 1.0), while the items that were easiest to endorse were Q10.5 (b = 3.23) and Q10.4 (b = 3.24). 3.5. Item Response Theory [Table 8](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t008)presents the results of the Rasch model fit and [Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#fig_body_display_jcm-12-02169-f001)and [Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#fig_body_display_jcm-12-02169-f002)present the graphical ranking of the items before and after the \"I order radiography for pathology and red flags\" is recorded. Once again, the Rasch model showed that DCs who utilize plain radiography of the spine only to rule out pathology in the presence of red flags are statistical outliers and are significantly inconsistent with the clinical opinion of the chiropractic profession. 3.6.

These doctors believe PROTS to be safe and that the DCs' clinical experience is adequate for recommending PROTS. (Q6) In summary, 77.6% of these US-based DCs indicated that PROTS has value beyond the identification of pathology, 79.1% indicate that PROTS is important regarding biomechanical analysis of the spine, 83.0% noted PROTS to be vital to chiropractic practice and 84.7% believe PROTS aids in measuring Discussion [68](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B68-jcm-12-02169), [69](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B69-jcm-12-02169), [70](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B70-jcm-12-02169), [71](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B71-jcm-12-02169)] to an absolute necessity of X-ray images to determine spine and biomechanical parameters [ [71](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B71-jcm-12-02169), [72](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B72-jcm-12-02169), [73](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B73-jcm-12-02169)]. [34](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B34-jcm-12-02169)] (pp. 106-108). Given the increasing evidence that chiropractic care has a positive impact on spinal health, the clinical experience and opinion of DCs should be considered in any practice guideline development that utilizes EBP as a foundation. Recall that EBP is the equivalent balance of three components: (1) the best research evidence, (2) clinical experience, and (3) the patient's preferences [ [74](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B74-jcm-12-02169)]. The best research evidence is clinically relevant, peer-reviewed research that has been conducted using sound methodology. Clinical experience refers to the clinician's cumulative experience, education, and clinical skills in managing patient care, and patient preference refers to the patient's unique concerns, expectations, and values. These three components should be taken into consideration in the decision-making process for patient care [ [75](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B75-jcm-12-02169)]. [Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t004)). Respondents were disaggregated into two groups, those who owned an X-ray machine in their clinic and those who did not, which served as the dependent variable. The authors of the study analyzed the responses of the two groups on every item in the survey (the analysis of dichotomous items is presented in [Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#fig_body_display_jcm-12-02169-f001), and the analysis of continuous items is presented in [Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#fig_body_display_jcm-12-02169-f002)). The two groups were statistically dissimilar on almost every survey item, which may suggest that the decision of owning a radiograph system in a chiropractic clinic goes above and beyond affordability. Believing that utilization of PROTS is vital to the chiropractic case and these radiographic procedures aid in the measurement of clinical outcomes emerged as the strongest predictors of having a radiographic system in a chiropractic clinic. These analyses (see [Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t004)) confirmed and strengthened previous findings (see [Table 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t002)and [Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#table_body_display_jcm-12-02169-t003)). In addition to analyzing the survey data and reporting the results, the authors of the study utilized the collected survey responses to construct a scale (a measurement instrument) for future use. The authors provided a valid and reliable scale with good internal consistency to assess clinical opinions toward the use of plain radiography in chiropractic clinical management and is so named the Clinician Opinion and Experience on also correlated with many other radiographic parameters, including thoracic and pelvic morphology [ [83](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B83-jcm-12-02169), [84](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B84-jcm-12-02169), [85](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B85-jcm-12-02169), [86](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B86-jcm-12-02169)] Altered spinal balance remains associated with higher mechanical load and dysfunctional movement patterns and is a possible source of increased risk of pain and degeneration care can result in radiographic changes to sagittal lumbar spinal alignment and posture, which is correlated with improved pain scores and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) [ [103](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B103-jcm-12-02169), [104](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B104-jcm-12-02169), Research has demonstrated that abnormal sagittal thoracic spinal alignment can be corrected, which is correlated with improvement in the risk of falls, headaches, forced expiratory volume, demonstrated that conservative correction of cervical lordosis and forward head posture can be associated with increased HRQOL, reduced back pain, and improved nervous system adaptability [ [100](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B100-jcm-12-02169)]. Coincidently, similar studies exist within the orthopedic research suggesting that the utilization of PROTS to measure surgical correction of biomechanical parameters such as sagittal vertical axis, lumbar lordosis, sacral slope, pelvic tilt and pelvic incidence angle have a direct impact on predictive surgical outcome, improved Oswestry Disability Index and improved patient HRQOL [ [116](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B116-jcm-12-02169), [117](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B117-jcm-12-02169), [118](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B118-jcm-12-02169), [119](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B119-jcm-12-02169), [120](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B120-jcm-12-02169)]. The current research suggesting the ability to correct radiographic parameters provides rationale for the clinical opinion of DCs indicated in the survey that more research should be dedicated to radiographic utilization in practice. 4.1. Other Findings [121](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B121-jcm-12-02169)]. The issue was echoed when the initial Rasch model was considered in the estimate of difficulty (the item was the most difficult to endorse) and the values of MSQ. After the item was reverse coded, the fit of the CFA and Rasch models was improved. 4.2. Strengths [122](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B122-jcm-12-02169)], but the model in the study was challenged by the limitations described in the previous sections. For the first time, researchers collected a sizable, national sample surveying clinical expertise of the chiropractic profession toward plain radiograph utilization for chiropractic case management. Although the data from previous studies show systematic dissimilarities in clinical opinions toward the use of PROTS for chiropractic management between DCs who own radiographs in their clinics and those who do not, the items were considered one by one. The predictive model developed by the researchers in this study considered all items at once. This approach allows for predictors to reveal statistical significance while controlling for all other variables in the model. Additionally, our study shows that those who agreed with the statement \"I order radiography for pathology and red flags\" are in the minority, which contradicts current trends in evidence-based practice recommendations. These guidelines tend to dictate the political stance for the rest of the profession using research that is highly susceptible to bias and that does not consider biomechanical analysis, treatment strategies, or patient outcome. This requires further research and visibility in the literature to improve the professional understanding of the value of plain radiography on patient outcome that is evident in the clinical opinion of practicing DCs. 4.3. Limitations [123](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B123-jcm-12-02169)]. The authors did not seek outside expertise in the creation of the survey and did not utilize an initial pilot study; some respondents may have misinterpreted the definition of red flags which could have skewed some of the responses. Additionally, it is possible that some DCs have no interest in the topic of utilization of PROTS, which would have resulted in self-selection bias and a lack of representation from DCs who are not strongly opinionated toward PROTS. When considering the EBP definition of clinical experience [ [75](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B75-jcm-12-02169)], our survey lacked the ability to determine the level of expertise and experience as it did not consider items such as years in practice, practice setting, levels of advanced education, hours of study per week and the financial implications of owning a radiographic unit. The distribution of the survey link to licensed DCs was based on email lists that were purchased from publication distribution lists and organizations that had access to significant national distribution of professionals. Therefore, we did not assign a priori probabilities to all population units to be selected in the sample. Although we attempted to minimize subjectivity, the inference of the findings to the target population may be susceptible to bias [ [124](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B124-jcm-12-02169)]. [124](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/6/2169#B124-jcm-12-02169)]. Additionally, the dependent variable in the predictive analysis (Q7) did not ask DCs directly whether they do or do not support taking spinal radiographs for chiropractic case management, so measuring clinical opinion was captured indirectly. Despite the limitations, this study provides novel information about DCs' clinical opinions toward utilization of PROTS. Researching the opinions and experience of practicing DCs may clarify the utilization of plain radiography in chiropractic. 4.4. Future Research 5.
