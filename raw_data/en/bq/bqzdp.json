Experiments evaluate the healing capabilities of homeopathy and prayer while discussing how everyday people can use energy to positively influence the world. 35,000 first printing. Gary E. Schwartz, Ph.D., is Professor of Psychology, Medicine, Neurology, Psychiatry, and Surgery at the University of Arizona, at the main campus in Tucson. In addition to teaching courses on health and spiritual psychology, he is the Director of the Laboratory for Advances in Consciousness and Health. Gary received his Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University in 1971 and was an assistant professor at Harvard for five years. He later served as a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Yale University, was director of the Yale Psychophysiology Center, and co-director of the Yale Behavioral Medicine Clinic, before moving to Arizona in 1988. In September 2002 he received a $1.8 million dollars award from the National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health to create a Center for Frontier Medicine in Biofield Science at the University of Arizona, which he directed for four years. Gary collaborates with Canyon Ranch on biofield science and energy healing research and serves as the Corporate Director of Development of Energy Healing at Canyon Ranch. Publications and Honors Gary has published more than four hundred and fifty scientific papers, including six papers in the journal Science. Gary has also co-edited eleven academic books, is the author of The Energy Healing Experiments (2007), The G.O.D. Experiments (2006), The Afterlife Experiments (2002), The Truth about Medium (2005), and The Living Energy Universe (1999). His new book The Sacred Promise: How Science is Discovering Spirit's Collaboration with Us in Our Daily Lives was published in January 2011. The Energy Healing Experiments (2007) received the Gold Medial from the Nautilus Book Awards. Gary is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychological Society, the Society for Behavioral Medicine, and the Academy for Behavioral Medicine Research. He received a Young Psychologist Award and an Early Career Award for Distinguished Research from the American Psychological Association. He served as President of the Biofeedback Society of America and the Health Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association. In 2004 he received a Distinguished Scientist Award for Energy Psychology from the Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology, and in 2006 a Distinguished Scientist Award from the United States Psychotronic Association. The Energy Healing Experiments was great. I loved the experiments (except the ones that involved intentionally inflicting pain on mice) and most of the ideas covered in the book were expressed in a straightforward and understandable manner. A couple of things let me down: the animal cruelty, Dr. Schwartz's rants which often took away from the scientific validity of his experiments, the questionable statistical reporting of the outcome of the experiments. If the results of the experiments were as clear and definitive as described then the entire world would be using Energy Healing. I was also left with the feeling that Dr. Schwartz was using this book as a platform to seek more funding as he mentions that if someone had the funding to do this experiment they could or that someone might like to look into this further. Overall I still enjoyed the book and have recommended it two people I know who are interested in the scientific side of energy healing. First off, these are not \"healing\" experiments. The chapters are about energy detection, psychic phenomena [and testing that], but there's no \"healing\" going on in the book with exception as I recall, of one case of cancer. There are several energy healers mentioned. I enjoyed the first few chapters of this book and the illustrative stories. But I expected the book to be experiments that the reader might try. Instead, the chapters are a series of experiments that the author performed to test energy awareness and psychic phenomena, along with results and his interpretation of those results. The book read like a series of articles. Schwartz wrote, in at least two of the chapters, that the experimental findings were published in a journal. The other chapters might have been articles that just didn't get published. Like a lot of these books centered on experiments, that's pretty much what you get and while this author tried to make the technical stuff short and easy...it was still pretty boring. I happily read several chapters before becoming bogged down and began skimming...then skipping..then giving up. If you like reading about experiments you'll like this. I just want the end result,I don't care how you did it or where or how many times. Just tell me what you found out!!! The beginning had some cool stories of healing and such. the author is one of those brilliant guys with a phd in a million different specialties - medicine, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and surgery to name a few - who has had a profound experience with energy healing personally and professionally. he designed and carried out a series of experiments, which were duplicated by other researchers in other labs, that basically prove the efficacy of a varity of energy healing techniques including Reiki. The results of his experiments, went beyond proving that these methods are statistically highly effective, just as much and perhaps more so than many traditional allopathic treatments (and considerably LESS expensive than many western allopathic treatments!). Results also suggest that most people, whether they know it or not, are sensitive to the energies of other people, and that some folks (healers in particular) can be more naturally sensitive to the energetic patterns of others physically and emotionally. Also, results indicate that the stress levels of the practitioner giving the treatment actually have an impact on the person receiving the treatment (the less stress a practioner is under, the more effective the treatment the client will receive) - something to think about when working with any healthcare practioner! This is very interesting technically, and the results of these experiments clearly indicate that energy healing definitely works although we don't fully understand how yet. There are such great implications and questions raised for future research, and hope for other highly effective yet simple healthcare solutions - energy medicine comes in many easily accesible \"user friendly\" forms, and the future of healthcare involves empowering people with easy choices and options for highly affordable self-healthcare. My main takeaway from Schwartz's book is his starting premise, which is that the body is an antenna--it picks up, amplifies, and broadcasts information via certain electromagnetic frequencies. I appreciated the documentation and discussion of repeatable, reproducible experiments by which others can attempt to verify that energy healing both occurs (meaning that some people treated by energy healers get well) and relies on systems by which other things happen in our world (meaning that plants, animals, inert objects and cell phones also have energy fields that communicate with one another). This is important: the book is about establishing that energy healing does happen and considering possible means by which it happens--it's NOT a how-to-do-it-yourself book. It's all woo-woo enough that I doubt it will persuade many hardcore skeptics, but what the hell, it was an intriguing read nonetheless. I felt the last third (with this extended explanation of energy healing via cell phone technology, a very cursory discussion of spirituality, and an \"envisioning\" of a possible future in which energy healing is regularly utilized by western medicine) was less valuable than the rest of the book; I also got tired of Schwartz's aggressively chatty, casual, colloquial diction and tone. But the subject matter overall still fascinated me and gave me some new ways to think about something I have already experienced and hope to explore. A good & mostly lucid introduction to \"energy healing\", including a research-based glance at such techniques as Reiki. For those who are already deep into this stuff, this book might be a little basic. But it could be a good scientific introduction to the topic for your friend who is just starting to get it. The last 3rd or so can be hard to follow in places, but the gist (one important concept examined here is that every human being has as much potential to heal others energetically as they might have to build houses or learn to play a musical instrument; that it's a talent, not a rare mutation, & that to a certain extent it can be learned) is well worth the time spent. in my constant search to the connection between myth, metaphysics, religion, and science, i stumbled upon this book on the same shelf as Matrix Energetics. i skimmed chapter 7, \"sensing the energy of minerals and crystals\" and am more curious about the people bringing up the interest, the actual experimenters, methods, tools and machinery, and the like. this review will evolve as i read through it.
