It requires intimacy. And I worry that the demands of constant communication and infinite information through social media are crowding out intimacy.\" The governor concluded his Commencement address by asking a promise of his listeners: \"Sometime today, put your tablet or smartphone aside, look your Mom and Dad in the eye, and tell them that you love them.

EPIC's 15,000-square-foot space houses a computer-aided design (CAD) studio, demonstration areas, fabrication facilities, materials testing, and project management software. The facility has a flexible design and offers students supply chain management software, 3-D printers, robotics, laser processing, and around-the-clock digital access to the studio's online resources. \"We're hoping to set a standard for the training of engineers for the future manufacturing economy in this country,\" says EPIC Director Gerry Fine, an ENG professor of the practice. 2013 Campus, Community, Global, Learning New Initiative on Urban Life Outgoing Boston Mayor Thomas M.

The total number of Christians worldwide continues to grow, even as the European and North American component of the world church has shrunk to less than one-third of the total. \"The center seeks to address several critical aspects of Christianity's 'shift southward' in the twenty-first century. First, Christianity must be understood as a multi-cultural and global movement, an enduring theological tradition that finds new life in the lived realities of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Second, the dramatic growth of world Christianity begs for analysis of the missionary dimension in all churches, as initiators rather than receptors of mission outreach. Third, growing churches are in need of theologically trained leaders, ranging from seminary professors, to grassroots leaders of indigenous churches. And finally, persons being educated to lead religious communities need to incorporate the understanding of these realities into their ministry and outreach.\"\u2014Dana L. Robert and Prof. M. L.

It seems fitting, then, that the first female graduation speaker in the University's history should also be the first woman to lead her people. And it is with great pride that I announce that the speaker at the University's Commencement exercises in 2001 is Her Excellency Sila M. Calder\u00f3n, governor of Puerto Rico.\" \"Image: a bird is one of the most amazing creatures in the universe. We marvel at its freedom to fly to the most far away places. Yet, we forget that for it to have that sense of unimpeded liberty, this tiny living thing is constantly battling much greater forces than itself: the wind, the rain, all kinds of tempests that threaten every part of its journey...Yet, it goes on...and on...and prevails against great odds. Be not afraid to lift your wings and let your spirits soar. Dream and do. Aspire and accomplish. Let that strength of character shine through. Enjoy life and, above all, be true to your soul.\"\u2014Sila Calder\u00f3n 2001 Research Management of Variability Program The high cost of health care places a great burden on the competitiveness of many major American manufacturing and other businesses. In response to cost-reduction pressures from corporate leaders, health care managers often respond in ways that negatively impact quality of care. Such responses fail to recognize a source of great waste in the health care delivery system: excessive variability in the processes used to provide care. The [Management of Variability Program](http://www.bu.edu/mvp/)develops, implements, and evaluates methods to reduce this type of artificial management variability and better manage \"natural\" variability. The premise is that researching the reduction of process variability has as much potential for reducing costs and improving quality as approaches like cost-effectiveness analyses of new technologies, practice guidelines, and provider profiling. Its importance lies in the fact that individual institutions alone cannot support this type of research, even though its results will be of great benefit to individual institutions and the health care system as a whole. 2001 Campus, Global, Learning, Research International Center for East Asian Archaeology & Cultural History The I [nternational Center for East Asian Archaeology & Cultural History](http://www.bu.edu/asianarc)(ICEAACH) opens to serve an international array of scholars and students pursuing the study of East Asian archaeology, art history, anthropology, history, religion, cultural heritage management, and related fields.
