I would alsolike to especially thank Danielle DiPalma for her editorial expertise and for her steadfastness to this project and Erin Sweeney for gently prodding me tocomplete revisions. They have been ever patient through chapter drafts andrevisions. In addition, I would like to thank Maryann Foley for her professionalcollaboration and attention to detail within the chapters. Her nursing backgroundhas been invaluable from the start. Special thanks to Sarah Kyle for her continueddedication to the vision and format of this textbook, as well as for her expert editing, and to Tom Gibbons for his skillful production of the text. I would like to thank photographer Gus Freedman and photo producer Amy Geller for their dedicated work on the photo shoot.

I'm sure I have overlooked severalother people who played a role in the development of this textbook, so a globalappreciation is extended to the Lippincott Williams & Wilkins vii11223-00_FMrev.qxd viiiix Susan Scott Ricci has a diploma from Washington Hospital Center School of Nursing, with a BSN, MSN, from Catholic University of America in Washington,D.C., an M.Ed. in Counseling from the University of Southern Mississippi, and islicensed as a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) from the University ofFlorida. She has worked in numerous women's health care settings includinglabor and delivery, postpartum, prenatal, and family planning ambulatory careclinics. Susan is a women's health care nurse practitioner, who has spent 30 + years in nursing education teaching in LPN, ADN, and BSN programs. She isinvolved in several professional nursing organizations and holds memberships inSigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing, National Association ofOb/Gyn Nurses, Who's Who in Professional Nursing, American NursesAssociation, and the Florida Council of Maternal-Child Nurses. With Susan Scott Ricci's wealth of practical and educational experience, the time has come for her to concentrate on the \"essential facts\" of nursing instructionand reduce the amount of \"nice to know\" information that is presented to students.As an educator, she recognized the tendency for nursing educators to want to\"cover the world\" when teaching rather than focusing on the facts that studentsneed to know to practice nursing.With this thought, Susan has directed her energyto the birth of this essentials textbook. She recognizes that instructional time is shrinking as the world of health care is expanding exponentially. Therefore, with the valuable instructional time allotted,she has recognized the urgent need to present pertinent facts as concisely as possibleto promote application of knowledge within nursing practice.ABOUT THE AUTHOR11223-00_FMrev.qxd 2:42 PM Page L.

pregnant with her thirdchild, comes to the prenatal clinicfor a routine follow-up visit. Hermother, Betty, accompanies herbecause Sophia's husband is out of town. Sophia lives with herhusband and two children, ages 4and 9. She works part-time as alunch aide in the local elementaryschool. What factors may play arole in influencing the health ofSophia and her family? 311223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 3person's ability to lead a fullling life and to partic- ipate fully in society depends largely on his or her healthstatus. This is especially true for women, who commonlyare responsible for not only their own health but that ofothers: their children and families. Thus, it is importantto focus on the health of women and families. Habits andpractices established during pregnancy and in early child-hood can have profound effects on a person's health andillness throughout life. As a society, creating a populationthat cares about women and their families and promotessolid health care and lifestyle choices is crucial. Maternal and newborn nursing encompasses a wide scope of practice typically associated with childbearing.It includes care of the woman before pregnancy, care ofthe woman and her fetus during pregnancy, care of thewoman after pregnancy, and care of the newborn, usuallyduring the rst 6 weeks after birth. The overall goal ofmaternal and newborn nursing is to promote and main-tain optimal health of the woman and her family. Now more than ever, nurses contribute to nearly every health care experience. Events from birth to death, andevery health care emergency in between, will likely involvethe presence of a nurse. Involvement of a knowledgeable,supportive, comforting nurse often leads to a positive healthcare experience. Skilled nursing practice depends on a solidbase of knowledge and clinical expertise delivered in a car-ing, holistic manner. Nurses, using their knowledge andpassion, help meet the health care needs of their clientsthroughout the life span, whether the client is a pregnantwoman, a fetus, a partner, or a woman with a health-relatedproblems. Nurses ll a variety of roles in helping clients tolive healthier lives by providing direct care, emotional sup-port, comfort, information, advice, advocacy, support, andcounseling. Nurses are often \"in the trenches\" advocatingfor issues, drawing attention to the importance of healthcare for the client, and dealing with the lack of resources,the lack of access to health care, and the focus on acute carerather than education and prevention. This chapter presents a general overview of the health care of women and their families and describes themajor factors affecting maternal, newborn, and women's health. Nurses need to be knowledgeable about theseconcepts and factors to ensure that they provide profes-sional care. Evolution of Maternal and Newborn Nursing The health care of women has changed over the years due in part to changes in childbirth methods, social trends,changes in the health care system, and federal and stateregulations. By reviewing historical events, nurses cangain a better understanding of the current and future sta-tus of maternal, newborn, and women's health nursing.4 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING Early Development Childbirth in colonial America was a difcult and danger- ous experience. During the 17th and 18th centuries,women giving birth often died as a result of exhaustion,dehydration, infection, hemorrhage, or seizures (Cassidy,2006). Approximately 50% of all children died beforeage 5 (Brodsky, 2006; Jolivet, 2006), compared with the0.06% infant mortality rate of today (World Factbook,2007). Centuries ago, \"granny midwives\" handled the nor- mal birthing process for most women. They learned theirskills through an apprenticeship with a more experiencedmidwife. Physicians usually were called only in extremelydifcult cases, and all births took place at home. During the early 1900s, physicians attended about half the births in the United States. Midwives often caredfor women who could not afford a doctor. Many womenwere attracted to hospitals because this showed affluenceand hospitals provided pain management, which was notavailable in home births. In the 1950s, \"natural childbirth\"practices advocating birth without medication and focus-ing on relaxation techniques were introduced. These tech-niques opened the door to childbirth education classes andhelped bring the father back into the picture. Both partnerscould participate by taking an active role in pregnancy,childbirth, and parenting (Fig. 1.1). Current Trends Box 1.1 shows a timeline of childbirth in America. Inmany ways, childbirth practices in the United States havecome full circle, as we see the return of nurse midwivesand doulas. The concept of women helping other womenduring childbirth is not new: women who labored andgave birth at home were traditionally attended to by rel-atives and midwives (see Evidence-Based Practice 1.1).A certied nurse midwife (CNM ) has postgraduate training in the care of normal pregnancy and delivery andis certied by the American College of Nurse Midwives(ACNM). A doula is a birth assistant who provides emo- tional, physical, and educational support to the womanand family during childbirth and the postpartum period.Many nurses working in labor and birth areas today arecredentialed in their specialty so that they can provideoptimal care to the woman and her newborn. Childbirthchoices are often based on what works best for the mother,child, and family. Core Concepts of Maternal, Newborn, and Women's Health Nursing Maternal, newborn, and women's health nursing focuses on providing evidence-based care to the client within thecontext of the family. This care involves the implementa-tion of an interdisciplinary plan in a collaborative mannerA11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM 1 PERSPECTIVES ON MATERNAL , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SHEALTH CARE 5 A B A B FIGURE1.1Today fathers and partners are welcome to take an active role in the pregnancy and childbirth experience. ( A) A couple can participate together in childbirth education classes. (Photo by Gus Freedman) ( B) Fathers and partners can assist the woman through- out her labor and delivery. (Photo by Joe Mitchell) BOX 1.1 Childbirth in America: A Time Line 1700s Men did not attend births, because it was consid- ered indecent. Women faced birth, not with joy and ecstasy, but with fear of death. Female midwives attended the majority of all births at home. 1800s There is a shift from using midwives to doctors among middle class women. The word obstetrician was formed from the Latin, meaning \"to stand before.\" Puerperal (childbed) fever was occurring in epidemic proportions. Louis Pasteur demonstrated that streptococci were the major cause of puerperal fever that waskilling mothers after delivery. The rst cesarean section was performed in Boston in 1894. The x-ray was developed in 1895 and was used to asses pelvic size for birthing purposes (Feldhusen 2003). 1900s Twilight sleep (a heavy dose of narcotics and am- nesiacs) was used on women during childbirthin the United States. The United States was 17th out of 20 nations in infant mortality rates. Fifty to 75% of all women gave birth in hospitals by 1940. Nurseries were started because moms could not care for their baby for several days after receiv-ing chloroform gas. Dr. Grantley Dick-Reed (1933) wrote a book en- titled Childbirth Without Fear that reduced the \"fear-tension-pain\" cycle women experiencedduring labor and birth.Dr. Fernand Lamaze (1984) wrote a book entitled Painless Childbirth: The Lamaze Method that advocated distraction and relaxation techniquesto minimize the perception of pain. Amniocentesis is rst performed to assess fetal growth in 1966. In the 1970s the cesarean section rate was about 5%. By 1990 it rose to 24%, where it standscurrently (Martin, 2002). The 1970s and 1980s see a growing trend to return birthing back to the basics\u2014nonmedicated,nonintervening childbirth. In the late birthing centers\u2014 LDRPs\u2014were and the number ofhome births began to increase. 2000s One in four women undergo a surgical birth (cesarean). CNMs once again assist couples at home, in hos- pitals, or in freestanding facilities with naturalchildbirths. Research shows that midwives arethe safest birth attendants for most women,with lower infant mortality and maternal rates,and fewer invasive interventions such as epi-siotomies and cesareans (Keefe 2003). Childbirth classes of every flavor abound in most communities. According to the latest available data, the United States ranks 21st in the world in maternaldeaths. The maternal mortality rate is approxi-mately 7 in 1000 live births. According to the latest available data, the United States ranks 27th in the world in infant mortalityrates. The infant mortality rate is approximately7 in 1000 live births (United Nations, 2003).11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 5to ensure continuity of care that is cost-effective, quality- oriented, and outcome-focused. It involves family-centered, evidence-based, case-managed care. Family-Centered Care Family-centered care is the delivery of safe, satisfying, high-quality health care that focuses on and adapts to thephysical and psychosocial needs of the family. It is a coop-erative effort of families and other caregivers that recognizesthe strength and integrity of the family. The basic princi-ples of family-centered care are: Childbirth is considered a normal, healthy event in the life of a family. Childbirth affects the entire family, and relationships will change. Families are capable of making decisions about their own care if given adequate information and professionalsupport) (Price, Noseworthy, & Thornton, 2007).6 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING The philosophy of family-centered care recognizes the family as the constant. The health and functioning of thefamily affect the health of the client and other members ofthe family. Family members support one another well be-yond the health care provider's brief time with them, suchas during the childbearing process or during a child's ill-ness. Birth is viewed as a normal life event rather than amedical procedure. With family-centered care, support and respect for the uniqueness and diversity of families are essential,along with encouragement and enhancement of the fam-ily's strengths and competencies. It is important to createopportunities for families to demonstrate their abilitiesand skills. Families also can acquire new abilities and skillsto maintain a sense of control. Family-centered care pro-motes greater family self-determination, decision-makingabilities, control, and self-efcacy, and family's empowerment. When imple-menting family-centered care, nurses seek caregiver input;Hodnett, E. D., Gates, S. Hofmeyr, G. J., & Sakata, C. (2007). Continuous support for women during childbirth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007. Issue 3. Art No.: CD003766.DOI:10.1002/ 14651858.CD003766.pub2.Throughout history, women have been helping other women in labor by providing emotional support, comfortmeasures, information, and advocacy. However, in recentyears this practice has waned, and facilities frequentlyadhere to strict specific routines that may leave womenfeeling \"dehumanized.\" Study A study was done to assess the effects on mothers and theirnewborns of continuous, one-to-one intrapartum care com-pared to usual care. The study also evaluated routine prac-tices and policies in the birth environment that might affect awoman's autonomy, freedom of movement, and ability tocope with labor; who the caregiver was (a staff member ofthe facility or not); and when the support began (early or latein labor). All published and unpublished randomized clinicaltrials comparing continuous support during labor with usualcare were examined. One author and one research assistantused standard methods for data collection and analysis andextracted the data independently. Clinical trial authors pro-vided additional information. The researchers used relativerisk for categorical data and weighted mean difference forcontinuous data. Sixteen trials from 11 countries involving13,391 women were examined. Findings Women receiving continuous intrapartum support had agreater chance of a spontaneous vaginal delivery (includ-ing without forceps or vacuum extraction). They also had a slight decrease in the length of labor and required less analgesia during this time. These women also reported increased satisfaction with their labor and childbirth expe-rience. Overall, the support, when provided by someoneother than a facility staff member and initiated early inlabor, proved to be more effective. Nursing Implications Based on this research, it is clear that women in labor ben- et from one-to-one support during labor. Nurses can usethe information gained from this study to educate womenabout the importance of having a support person duringlabor and delivery. Nurses can also act as client advocatesin facilities where they work to foster an environment thatencourages the use of support persons during the intra-partum period. The focus of nursing needs to be individu-alized, supportive, and collaborative with the family duringtheir childbearing experience. In short, nurses should placethe needs of the mother and her family rst in providing acontinuum of care. Although the study found that support is more effective when provided by someone other than a staff member,support from an individual is the key. Assigning the samenurse to provide care to the couple throughout the birthingexperience also fosters a one-to-one relationship that helpsmeet the couple's needs and promotes feelings of security.By meeting the couple's needs, the nurse is enhancing theirbirthing experience. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 1.1 Women's Response to Continuous Labor Support11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 6these suggestions and advice are incorporated into the client's plan of care as the nurse counsels and teachesthe family appropriate health care interventions. Today, as nurses partner with various experts to provide high-qualityand cost-effective care, one expert partnership that nursescan make is with the client's family. The impact of family-centered care can be seen in the models of care delivery for women. From the 1980s tothe present, increased access to care for all women (regard-less of their ability to pay) and hospital redesigns (labor,delivery, and recovery [LDR] rooms; labor, delivery, re-covery, and postpartum [LDRP] spaces) aimed families the childbirth experience(Fig. 1.2). Evidence-Based, Case-Managed Care Evidence-based nursing practice involves the use of research in establishing a plan of care and implementingthat care. Evidence-based practice is a problem-solvingapproach to making nursing clinical decisions (New-house, 2006). This model of nursing practice includesthe use of the best current evidence in making decisionsabout care. Widespread use of evidence-based practicemay lead to a decrease in variation of care while at thesame time increasing quality. Modern health care focuses on an interdisciplinary plan of care designed to meet a client's physical, devel-opmental, educational, spiritual, and psychosocial needs. This interdisciplinary collaborative type of care is termed case management , a collaborative process involving assessment, planning, implementation, coordination,monitoring, and evaluation. It involves the followingcomponents: Advocacy, communication, and resource management Client-focused comprehensive care across a continuum Coordinated care with an interdisciplinary approach (Foster & Heath, 2007)CHAPTER 1 PERSPECTIVES ON MATERNAL , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SHEALTH CARE 7 When the nurse effectively functions in the role as a case manager, client and family satisfaction is increased,fragmentation of care is decreased, and outcome meas-urement for a homogenous group of clients is possible. FIGURE1.2Providing an opportunity for the \"big brother\" to interact with his new siblings is an important component offamily-centered nursing care.Think back to Sophia and her mother, Betty, who were described at the beginning of the chapter. Sophia and herhusband are planning to use natural childbirth and to havetheir children present for the birth. While Sophia is waitingto be called for her appointment, Betty says, \"Things havechanged so much since I was pregnant. It's amazing whathappens nowadays.\" Explain how things have changed inmaternal and newborn health care, focusing on the concept of family-centered care. Health Status At one time, health was dened simply as the absence of disease; health was measured by monitoring the mortalityand morbidity of a group. Over the past century, however,the focus on health has shifted to disease prevention,health promotion, and wellness. The World Health Or-ganization defines health as \"a state of complete phys-ical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" (WHO, 2008). The def-inition of health is complex; it is not merely the absenceof disease or an analysis of mortality and morbidity statistics. In 1979, the Surgeon General's Report, Healthy Peo- ple,presented a prevention agenda for the nation that iden- tied the most signicant preventable threats to the healthof the United States. Through a series of reports (the cur-rent report is Healthy People 2010: National Health Promo- tion and Disease Prevention Objectives ), the country now has a comprehensive, nationwide health promotion and diseaseprevention agenda that includes emphasis on children'shealth (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services[DHHS], 2000). Ten specic health indicators serve as away to evaluate progress made in the public health arenaand to coordinate the national health improvement efforts.Healthy People 2010 highlights the major health indicatorsof the 21st century that need to be addressed. Physical activity Overweight and obesity Tobacco use Substance abuse Responsible sexual behaviorMental health Injury and violence Environmental quality Immunizations Access to health careHEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Major Health Concerns of the 21st Century11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 78 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING Maternal Mortality The maternal mortality rate is the number of deaths from any cause during the pregnancy cycle per 100,000live births. In the United States, the maternal mortalityrate is 7.5 (UNICEF, 2007). The federal government haspledged to improve maternal-child care outcomes andthus reduce mortality rates for women and children. During the past several decades, mortality and morbid- ity have dramatically decreased as a result of an increasedemphasis on hygiene, good nutrition, exercise, and prena-tal care for all women. However, women are still experienc-ing complications at signicant rates. The United States isone of the most medically and technologically advanced na-tions and has the highest per capita spending on health carein the world, but our current mortality rates indicate theneed for improvement. For example: Two or three women die in the United States every day from pregnancy complications, and more than 30% ofpregnant women (1.8 million women annually) experi-ence some type of illness or injury during childbirth(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],2007a). The United States ranks 21st (in other words, below 20 other countries) in rates of maternal deaths (deaths per100,000 live births). Most pregnancy-related complications are preventa- ble. The most common are ectopic pregnancy, pre-term labor, hemorrhage, emboli, hypertension,infection, stroke, diabetes, and heart disease. Theleading causes of pregnancy-related mortality for theyear 2003 (the last year for which are available)are The maternal mortality and morbidity rates for African-American women have been three to four timeshigher than for whites (NCHS, 2007). Researchers donot entirely understand what accounts for this disparity,but some suspected causes of the higher maternal mortal-ity rates for minority women include low socioeconomicstatus, limited or no insurance coverage, bias among health care providers (which may foster distrust), and quality ofcare available in the community. Language and legal bar-riers may also explain why some immigrant women donot receive good prenatal care. Lack of care during pregnancy is a major factor con- tributing to a poor outcome. Prenatal care is well known toprevent complications of pregnancy and to support thebirth of healthy infants, and not all women receive the samequality and quantity of health care during a pregnancy.More than 40% of African-American, Native American,and Latino women do not obtain prenatal care during theirrst trimester of pregnancy (Hollander, 2006). The CDC has noted that the disparity in maternal mortality rates between women of color and white women Reduce fetal and infant deaths. Reduce maternal deaths. Reduce maternal illness and complications resulting from pregnancy. Increase the proportion of pregnant women who receive early and adequate prenatal care. Increase the proportion of pregnant women who attend a series of prepared childbirth classes. Increase the proportion of very low-birth weight (VLBW) infants born at level III hospitals or subspecialty perinatal centers. Reduce cesarean births among low-risk (full-term, singleton, vertex presentation) women. Reduce low birth weight (LBW) and VLBW. Reduce preterm births. Increase the proportion of mothers who achieve a recommended weight gain during their pregnancies. Increase the percentage of healthy, full-term infants who are laid down to sleep on their backs. Reduce the occurrence of developmental disabilities. Reduce the occurrence of spina bida and other neural tube defects (NTDs). Increase the proportion of pregnancies begun with an optimum folic acid level. Increase abstinence from alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs among pregnant women. Reduce the occurrence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Increase the proportion of mothers who breast-feed their babies. Ensure appropriate newborn bloodspot screening, follow-up testing, and referral to services.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 National Health Goals\u2014Maternal, Infant and Child HealthHealthy People 2010 also outlines major goals intended to increase the quality and years of healthy life and to elim-inate health disparities between ethnic groups by targetingthe lifestyle choices and environmental conditions thatcause 70% of premature deaths in the United States.Healthy People 2010 identifies specific national healthgoals related to maternal, infant, and child health. Measuring health status is not a simple or convenient process. For example, some individuals with chronic ill-nesses do not see themselves as ill if they can control theircondition through self-management. A traditional methodused in this country to measure health is to examinemortality and morbidity data. Information is collected andanalyzed to provide an objective description of the nation'shealth. Mortality Mortality is the incidence or number of individuals who have died over a specic period. This statistic is presentedas rates per 100,000 and is calculated from a sample ofdeath certicates. The National Center for Health Statis-tics, under the DHHS, collects, analyzes, and dissemi-nates the data on America's mortality rates.11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 8represent one of the largest racial disparities among public health indicators. Eliminating racial and ethnic disparitiesin maternal\u2014child health care requires enhanced efforts atpreventing disease, promoting health, and delivering ap-propriate and timely care (CDC, 2007b). The CDC hascalled for more research and monitoring to understandand address racial disparities, along with increased fund-ing for prenatal and postpartum care. Research is neededto identify causes and to design initiatives to reduce thesedisparities, and the CDC is calling on Congress to expandprograms to provide preconception and prenatal care tounderserved women. Fetal Mortality The fetal mortality rate or fetal death rate refers to the intrauterine death of a fetus who is 20 weeks of gestationor more per 1,000 live births. Fetal mortality may be at-tributable to maternal factors (e.g., malnutrition, disease,or preterm cervical dilation) or fetal factors (e.g., chro-mosomal abnormalities or poor placental attachment).Fetal mortality provides an overall picture of the qualityof maternal health and prenatal care. Neonatal and Infant Mortality The neonatal mortality rate is the number of infant deaths occurring in the rst 28 days of life per 1,000 livebirths. The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths occurring in the rst 12 months of life. It also is docu-mented as the number of deaths of infants younger than1 year of age per 1,000 live births. The infant mortality rateis used as an index of the general health of a country. Gen-erally, this statistic is one of the most signicant measuresof children's health. In the United States, the infant mor-tality rate is 6.0 (CDC, 2007b) (Fig. 1.3). The infant mortality rate varies greatly from state to state as well as between ethnic groups. The United Stateshas one of the highest gross national products in the worldand is known for its technological capabilities, but in 2000it ranked 27th in infant mortality rates among industrial-ized nations (U.S. DHHS, 2006). The main causes of earlyCHAPTER 1 PERSPECTIVES ON MATERNAL , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SHEALTH CARE 9 infant death in this country include problems occurring at birth or shortly thereafter. These include prematurity,low birthweight, congenital anomalies, sudden infant death syndrome, and respiratory distress syndrome. shtrib evil 000,1 rep shtaeD 01020304050 1940 1960 1950Infant Neonatal 2000 FIGURE1.3Infant and neonatal mortality, 1940-2003. African-American and American Indian/ Alaska Native infants have consistently had higher infant mortality rates than other ethnicgroups (March of Dimes, 2006).Take NOTE! Congenital anomalies remain the leading cause of in- fant mortality in the United States. Low birthweight andprematurity are major indicators of infant health and sig-nicant predictors of infant mortality (March of Dimes,2008). The lower the birthweight, the higher the risk ofinfant mortality; thus, the high incidence of low birth-weight (<2,500 g) in the United States is a signicant rea-son why its infant mortality rate is higher than that ofother countries (March of Dimes, 2008). After birth, other health promotion strategies can sig- nicantly improve an infant's health and chances of sur-vival. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce rates ofinfection in infants and to improve their long-term health.Emphasizing the importance of placing an infant on his orher back to sleep will reduce the incidence of sudden in-fant death syndrome. Encouraging mothers to join supportgroups to prevent postpartum depression and learn soundchildrearing practices will improve the health of bothmothers and their infants. Morbidity Morbidity and Women Women today face not only diseases of genetic origin butalso diseases that arise from poor personal habits. Eventhough women represent 51% of the population, only re-cently have researchers and the medical community fo-cused on their special health needs. A recent signicantstudy identied an urgent need to improve women's accessto health insurance and health care services, place astronger emphasis on prevention, and invest in more re-search on women's health (National Women's Law Center[NWLC] et al., 2007). It identied indicators of women'saccess to health care services, measuring the degree towhich women receive preventive health care and engage inhealth-promoting activities (Box 1.2). The report card gavethe nation an overall grade of \"unsatisfactory,\" and not asingle state received a grade of \"satisfactory.\" Other sub-standard ndings included the following: No state has focused enough attention on preventive measures, such as smoking cessation, exercise, nutrition,and screening for diseases.11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 9 Too many women lack health insurance coverage: nationally, nearly one in seven women (14%) has nohealth insurance. No state has adequately addressed women's health needs in the areas of reproductive health, mentalhealth, and violence against women. Limited research has been done on health conditions that primarily affect women and that affect womendifferently than men (NWLC et al., 2007). Poor health habits can have a negative impact on all women. Smoking, drug abuse, high cholesterol levels,and obesity lead to high mortality and morbidity ratesin our nation. Major Health Issues for Women Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number-one causeof death of women, regardless of racial or ethnic group.More than 500,000 women die annually in the UnitedStates of CVD\u2014about one death per minute (Alexanderet al., 2007) Women who have a heart attack are morelikely than men to die. Heart attacks in women are oftenmore difcult to diagnose than in men because of theirvague and varied symptoms. Heart disease is still thoughtof as a \"man's disease,\" and thus a heart attack may notbe considered in the differential diagnosis when a womanpresents to the emergency room. Nurses need to look be-yond the obvious \"crushing chest pain\" textbook symp-tom that heralds a heart attack in men. Manifestations ofheart disease differ between men and women in severalother ways\u2014for example, menopause (associated with asignicant rise in coronary events); diabetes, high choles-terol levels, and left ventricular hypertrophy; and repeated10 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING episodes of weight loss and gain (increased coronary mor- bidity and mortality) (Framingham Heart Study [FHS],2007). Cancer is the second leading cause of death among women (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2008a). Women have a one-in-three lifetime risk of developing cancer,and one out of every four deaths is from cancer (Alexanderet al., 2007). Although much attention is focused on can-cer of the reproductive system, lung cancer is the number-one killer of women. This is largely the result of smokingand second-hand smoke. Lung cancer has no early symp-toms, making early detection almost impossible. Thus,lung cancer has the lowest survival rate of any cancer:more than 90% of people who get lung cancer die of it(ACS, 2008b). Breast cancer occurs in one in every seven women in a lifetime. It is estimated that in 2008 about 182,460 newcases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed amongwomen in the United States. Women living in NorthAmerica have the highest rate of breast cancer in the world.At this time there are about 2.5 million breast cancer sur-vivors in the United States. It is the most common malig-nancy in women and second only to lung cancer as a causeof cancer mortality in women (ACS, 2008c). Although apositive family history of breast cancer, aging, and irregu-larities in the menstrual cycle at an early age are major riskfactors, others risk factors include excess weight, not hav-ing children, oral contraceptive use, excessive alcohol con-sumption, a high-fat diet, and long-term use of hormonereplacement therapy (ACS, 2008c). Breast cancer rateshave dropped recently, possibly due to the decreased useof long-term hormone replacement therapy that occurredafter the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) report was re-leased in 2002 (Heiss et al., 2008). However, early detec-tion and treatment continue to offer the best chance for acure, and reducing the risk of cancer by decreasing avoid-able risks continues to be the best preventive plan. Women's health is a complex issue, and no single policy is going to change the overall dismal state ratings.Although progress in science and technology has helpedreduce the incidence of and improve the survival rates forseveral diseases, women's health issues continue to havean impact on our society. By eliminating or decreasingsome of the risk factors and causes for prevalent diseasesand illnesses, society and science could minimize certainchronic health problems. Focusing on the causes andeffects of particular illnesses could help resolve manywomen's health issues of today. Factors Affecting Maternal, Newborn, and Women's Health From conception, children are shaped by a myriad of fac- tors such as genetics and the environment. As members ofa family, they are also members of a specic population,BOX 1.2 The National Indicators of Women's Health Lung cancer death rate Diabetes Heart disease death rate Binge drinking High school completion Poverty Wage gap Rate of AIDS Maternal mortality rate Rate of Chlamydia infection Breast cancer death rate Heart disease death rate Smoking Being overweight No physical activity during leisure time Eating ve fruits and vegetables daily Colorectal screening Mammograms Pap smears First-trimester prenatal care Access to health insurance Adapted from National Women's Law Center, FOCUS/University of Pennsylvania, the Lewin Group.

As they learn and grow, they are affected by multiple, complex, and ever-changinginfluences around them. For example, dramatic demo-graphic changes in the United States have led to shiftsin majority and minority population groups. Globaliza-tion has led to an international focus on health. Accessto and the types of health care available have changeddue to modifications in health care delivery and financ-ing. In addition, the United States is still grappling withissues such as immigration, poverty, homelessness, andviolence. These factors may affect the person positively, pro- moting healthy growth and development, or negatively,increasing the person's health risks. Nurses, especiallythose working with women and their families, need to un-derstand how these influences affect the quality of nurs-ing care and health outcomes. They must examine theimpact of these variables to gain the knowledge and skillsneeded to plan effective care, thereby achieving the bestpossible outcomes. Family The family is considered the basic social unit. The way that families are dened has changed (Table 1.1). TheU.S. Census Bureau (2007) denes family as a group oftwo or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adop-tion and living together. Earlier denitions of family em-phasized the legal ties or genetic relationships of peopleliving in the same household with specic roles. The family greatly influences the development and health of its members. For example, children learn health care activities, health beliefs, and health values fromtheir family. The family's structure, the roles assumedby family members, and social changes that affect thefamily's life can influence the woman's and newborn'shealth status. Families are unique: each one has differ-ent views and requires distinct methods for support(Fig. 1.4). Changes in Parental Roles Over Time Parental roles have evolved over time due to social andeconomic changes as well as family changes. Tradition-ally, the role of provider was assigned to the father. How-ever, with increased numbers of women in the workplaceand more households with two parents working, todayboth parents are often the providers as well as the nurtur-ers. Technological expansion has provided parents withopportunities to work at home, allowing some parents tomaintain the provider role while simultaneously fulllingthe nurturer and health manager roles. Fathers also aretaking on greater responsibilities related to householdmanagement and infant and child care. Additionally, thenumber of single-father parent families and grandparentfamilies is increasing.Genetics Genetics (the study of heredity and its variations) has im-plications for all stages of life and all types of diseases. Thenewborn's or infant's biological traits, including gender,race, some behavioral traits, and the presence of certain dis-eases or illnesses, are directly linked to genetic inheritance.New technologies in molecular biology and biochemistryhave led to a better understanding of the mechanismsinvolved in hereditary transmission, including those asso-ciated with genetic disorders. These advances are leadingto better diagnostic tests and better management options. Gender Gender is established when the sex chromosomes join.A person's gender can influence many aspects, such asphysical characteristics and personal attributes, attitudes,and behaviors. Some diseases or illnesses are more com-mon in one sex; for example, scoliosis is more commonin females and color blindness in males. Race Race refers to the physical features that distinguish mem-bers of a particular group, such as skin color, bone struc-ture, or blood type. Some physical features that are normalin a particular race may be considered a sign of a disorderin other races. For example, epicanthal folds (the verticalfolds of skin that partially or completely cover the innercanthi of the eye) are normal in Asian children but mayoccur with Down syndrome or renal agenesis in otherraces. In addition, certain malformations and diseasesare found more commonly in specic races. For exam- ple, sickle cell anemia occurs more often in African and Mediterranean population groups, and cystic brosis isseen more often in individuals from the NorthwesternEuropean population group. Society Society has a major impact on the health of women and their families. Major influences include social roles, so-cioeconomic status, the media, and the expanding globalnature of society. Each of these may influence a person'sself-concept, where he or she lives, the lifestyle he or sheleads\u2014and thus his or her health. Social Roles Society often prescribes specific patterns of behaviors:certain behaviors are permitted and others are prohibited.CHAPTER 1 PERSPECTIVES ON MATERNAL , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SHEALTH CARE 11 Recall Sophia, the pregnant woman described at the beginning of the chapter.

Similar to single-parent family May lead to family conflict due to different expecta- tions on the part of the child and adults; they mayhave different views and practices related tochildcare and health Need to identify decision-maker and primary care- taker of the children Popular in some cultures, such as Hispanic and Asian cultures May face negative attitudes about their \"different\" lifestyle May face negative attitudes about their \"different\" lifestyle Need to determine the decision-maker and caretaker of the children May include the foster family's children and other foster children in the home Foster children are more likely to have unmet health needs and chronic health problems because theymay have been in a variety of health systems(AAP, 2000).

Social roles influence a person'sideas about himself or herself. Social roles are generallycarried out in groups with which the individual has inti-mate daily contact, such as the family, school, workplace,or peer groups. Socioeconomic Status Another dominant influence is a person's socioeconomic status, his or her relative position in society. This includesthe family's economic, occupational, and educationallevels. Low socioeconomic status typically has an adverseinfluence on an individual's health. Health care costs arecontinuing to rise, as are health insurance premiums. Thefamily may not be able to afford food, health care, andhousing; meals may be unbalanced, erratic, or insuf-cient. Housing may be overcrowded or have poor sanita-tion. These families may not understand the importanceof preventive care or may simply not be able to afford it.As a result, they may be exposed to health risks such aslead poisoning or may not be immunized against commu-nicable diseases. Poverty Poverty is a measurement based on the specic monetaryincome of a family. The poverty threshold is the dollaramount that the U.S. Census Bureau uses to determinewhether a family is living in poverty. If the individual's orfamily's income is below the threshold, then that personor family is said to be living in poverty. Despite the many global economic gains that have been made during the past century, poverty continues togrow and the gap between rich and poor is widening. Majorgaps continue between the economic opportunities andstatus afforded to women and those offered to men. A dis-proportionate share of the burden of poverty rests onwomen's shoulders, and this undermines their health.However, poverty, particularly for women, is more thanmonetary deciency. Women continue to lag behind menin control of cash, credit, and collateral. Other forms ofimpoverishment may include deficiencies in literacy,education, skills, employment opportunities, mobility,and political representation, as well as pressures on timeand energy linked to their responsibilities. These povertyfactors may affect a woman's health (WHO, 2007a, 2007b,2007c). Homelessness Families with children are the fastest-growing segment ofthe homeless population. Homeless families commonlyare victims of violence and may have mental health chal-lenges. Homelessness occurs in large urban areas and mid-size cities as well as suburban and rural areas. Homelessness can have a negative impact on health and well-being in numerous ways, including: Mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, or aggressive behavior A B C FIGURE1.4Nurses must take into account family dynamics when providing health care. There are many different familystructures, and they influence the client's needs. ( A) The traditional nuclear family is composed of two parents andtheir biological or adopted children. ( B) The extended family includes the nuclear family plus other family members, suchas grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. ( C) Gay and lesbian families comprise two people of the same sex sharing acommitted relationship with or without children.11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 13 Chronic health problems and injuries Nutritional deciencies, affecting fetal growth and development Behaviors such as illegal substance use or unprotected sex with multiple partners Limited access to health care services such as preven- tive care, prenatal care, or dental care Violence Violence can occur in any setting and can involve anyindividual. Violence against women is a major healthconcern\u2014it affects thousands of lives and costs the health care system millions of dollars. Violence affects families,women, and children of all ages, ethnic backgrounds,races, educational levels, and socioeconomic levels. Preg-nancy is often a time when physical abuse starts or esca-lates, resulting in poorer outcomes for the mother and thebaby. The nurse is responsible for assessing for and follow-ing up on any abuse. Violence in the home environment, known as domes- tic violence, affects many lives in the United States. TheU.S. Bureau of Justice (2006) estimates that 1 million vio-lent crimes are committed by former spouses, boyfriends,or girlfriends each year; about 85% of the victims arewomen. This violence is known as intimate partner abuse,family violence, wife beating, battering, marital abuse, orpartner abuse, but regardless of the term used, its effectsare widespread. Nurses serve their clients best not by trying to rescue them, but by helping them build on their strengths andproviding support, thereby empowering them to helpthemselves. All nurses need to include \"RADAR\" in everyclient visit (Box 1.3). Community Community encompasses a broad range of concepts, fromthe nation where a person lives down to a particular neigh-borhood or group. The surrounding community affectsmany aspects of a person's health and general welfare. Thequality of life within the community has a great influenceon an individual's ability to develop and become a func-tional member of society. Community influences in-clude the school, which is a community by itself, and peer groups. The support and assistance offered to women andtheir families from other areas of the community, such as14 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING school programs and community centers, can improve the individual's overall health and well-being. Culture Culture is a view of the world and a set of traditions that are used by a specic social group and are transmitted tothe next generation. It plays a critical role with women andtheir families. A person's culture influences not only social-ization but also his or her experiences related to health andspecic health practices (Stanhope & Lancaster, 2008).Culture is a complex phenomenon involving many com- ponents, such as beliefs, values, language, time, personalspace, and view of the world, all of which shape a person'sactions and behavior. Individuals learn these patterns ofcultural behaviors from their family and communitythrough a process called enculturation, which involves ac-quiring knowledge and internalizing values. Culture influ-ences every aspect of development and is reflected inchild-bearing and child-rearing beliefs and practices de-signed to promote healthy adaptation. With today's changing demographic patterns, nurses must be able to assimilate cultural knowledge into theirinterventions so they can care for culturally diverse women, children, and families. Nurses must be aware of the widerange of cultural traditions, values, and ethics. Cultural competence is the ability to apply knowledge about a client's culture so that the health care provided can beadapted to meet her needs. Nurses need to learn aboutgeneral cultural groups, ethnicity, health practices andhow they affect women and their health, and the changingdemographics of the population. This will help them viewculture as a point of congruence rather than as a potentialsource of conflict with clients. Cultural Groups A society typically includes dominant and minority groups. The dominant group, often the largest group, is the groupthat has the greatest authority to control values and sanc-tions of the society (Taylor et al., 2005). As a result, thedominant or majority culture may have the largest impacton health. The minority cultural groups may remain intheir own communities and maintain some of their tra-ditions and values while mainstreaming into Americansociety. A culture may contain many subcultures, andgeographic differences also can occur: for example, Latin Americans living in New York may be quite differentfrom Latin Americans living in Florida. Being aware ofthese differences is essential in providing culturally com-petent care. Nurses need to be aware of the health care values and practices that are passed along from one generation to thenext. For example, the belief in folk healers relates to howthe culture interprets illness and health. Some of theseparts of the culture may have major influences on an indi-vidual's health. Table 1.2 highlights some major culturalgroups and their common health beliefs and practices. BOX 1.3 RADAR R-Routinely screen every patient for abuse.

Nutritional deciencies or excesses are common problems in the United States, as evidenced by the persist-ent problem of iron-deciency anemia and the increasingincidence of obesity. Inadequate food intake, social andcultural food practices or habits that may be nutritionallyunsound, the availability of processed and nutritionallyinadequate foods, lack of nutrition education in homesand schools, and the presence of illness that interferes withthe ingestion, digestion, and absorption of food are factorsthat can affect an individual's nutrition. During pregnancy, a woman needs additional calories to support fetal growth and development as well as to sup-port her own needs, and an adequate intake of folic acidis important to prevent neural tube defects (Fig. 1.5).Nutrition and its effects on health status are integratedthroughout this text. Lifestyle Choices Lifestyle choices that affect an individual's health includeeating, exercise, use of tobacco, drugs, or alcohol, andmethods of coping with stress. Most health problems thatarise today are due to an individual's lifestyle. Poor lifestyle choices made early in life can affect the quality of life as an individual ages. The same concept of making poorchoices can be applied to pregnant women and the healthand well-being of the infant. Maintaining a healthy levelof activity through exercise and hobbies is important foradults and children. Environmental Exposure Some environmental exposures can jeopardize health. Inutero, the fetus can be affected by lack of maternal nutri-16 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING tion, maternal infections, or maternal use of alcohol, to- bacco, and drugs. Nurses caring for pregnant womenshould be aware of the risks to the fetus posed by certaindrugs, chemicals, and dietary agents, as well as mater-nal illnesses. These agents, known as teratogens, may be linked to birth defects in children. Not all drugs or agentshave fetal effects, however, and research is necessary toidentify the correlations between teratogens and othervariables. Stress and Coping Disasters such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the killings at Columbine High School, or Hurri-cane Katrina can have a signicant impact on the well-being of women, children, and families. Stressors suchas war, terrorism, violence, and natural disasters may de-crease a person's coping ability. Exposure to traumaticevents and violence may have long-term effects on anindividual's psychosocial development and status. Exposure to stress is not limited to disasters or trau- matic events, however. Stress can also include areassuch as inadequate finances, family crises, inadequatesupport systems, or domestic violence. Like disasters and traumatic events, the effects of these stressors candramatically affect the health status of a woman or family. FIGURE1.5A pregnant client is eating a healthy meal to ensure adequate nutrition. Nurses can have a lifelong influence on an individual's perceptions of health and use of health services. By understanding how the woman'sand family's culture influences their health practices,nurses can enhance the family's traditional practices,and different cultural practices can become sources ofstrength rather than areas of conflict.Take NOTE! The health status of a newborn may affect his or her long-term health and develop ment.Take NOTE! 11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 16Health Care Cost Containment The health care system functions within a market setting, offering goods and services that carry a cost to health careconsumers and clients. The advent of managed care hasled to a trend of attempting to reduce health care costs.These efforts have led to shorter hospital stays and in-creased awareness on the part of nurses of the costs ofsupplies and services. The overall challenge is to maintainthe quality of care while reducing its cost. For example, ifa pregnant diabetic woman needs to go to an endocrinol-ogist, she has very little choice except to purchase the serv-ices needed or go without care. In today's managed careenvironment, the woman will need to go through her \"pri-mary health care professional\" or \"gatekeeper\" to receivea referral to a specialist. Often she must trust her primaryprovider to make that choice for her instead of making that decision on her own. Although cost containment is important to restrain health care spending, such efforts should not reduce thequality or safety of care delivered. Preventive care (re-member the old saying \"an ounce of prevention is wortha pound of cure\") has been shown to lower costs signi-cantly. Mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, prena-tal care, smoking cessation programs, and immunizationsare a few examples of preventive care that yield positiveoutcomes and reduce overall health care costs. Usingtechnological advances to diagnose and treat diseasesearly saves lives as well as money. Nurses can be leaders in providing quality care within a limited-resource environment by emphasizing to theirclients the importance of making healthy lifestyle and foodchoices, seeking early interventions for minor problems be-fore they become major ones, and learning about health-related issues that affect them so they can select the bestoption for themselves and their families. Prevention serv-ices and health education are the cornerstones of deliveringquality maternal, newborn, and women's health care. Access to Health Care The health care system continues to change. In the United States, changes in the health care system result from pres-sures coming from many directions. These changes reflectshifts in social and economic realities and the results of the biomedical and technological progress that has been madeover the past several decades. The effects are felt byevery individual who seeks health care in any form. Thesystem of providing medical care in a high-tech environ-ment has changed to providing health care in an environ-ment with limited resources and access to services. Waysto allocate our limited health care resources continue tobe the focus. A major factor involved access to care is health insur- ance. People without health insurance typically cannotafford to seek health care for maintenance and preventioninterventions. The \"working poor\" may not earn enoughmoney to afford health insurance or medical care, andpart-time workers do not always receive benets such ashealth insurance. Preventive Care Focus The emphasis on cost reduction has also led to an empha-sis on preventive care and services. Anticipatory guidanceis vital during each health contact with women and theirfamilies. Education of the family includes everything fromkeeping the home safe to ways to prevent illness. The Continuum of Care Emphasis A \"continuum of care\" strategy is cost-effective and pro-vides more efcient and effective services. This continuumextends from acute care settings such as hospitals to out-patient settings such as ambulatory care clinics, primarycare ofces, rehabilitative units, community care settings,long-term facilities, and homes. For example, the hospitalstay is now integrated into a continuum that allows theclient to complete therapy at home or other communitysettings, while re-entering the hospital for short periods forspecic treatments or illnesses. Improvements in Diagnosis and Treatments Because of the tremendous improvements that have been made in technology and biomedicine, disorders and dis-eases are being diagnosed and treated earlier. The 1990switnessed a remarkable and productive connection be-tween genetics and various pathophysiologic processes.For example, female fetuses with congenital adrenal hy-perplasia, a genetic disorder resulting in a steroid enzymedeciency that can lead to disguring anatomic abnor-malities, are beginning to receive treatment before birth.In addition, many genetic defects are being identied socounseling and treatment may occur early. With theseimproved diagnoses and treatments, nurses may now becaring for individuals who have survived situations thatonce would have been fatal, who are living well beyondtheir life expectancy for a specic illness, or who are func-tioning with chronic disabilities. For example, at one timeCHAPTER 1 PERSPECTIVES ON MATERNAL , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SHEALTH CARE 17 Recall Sophia, the 38-year-old pregnant woman who has come to the prenatal clinic for a visit. While talking with thenurse, Sophia mentions that her children are very involvedin activities. She says, \"My husband is busy at work, so I domost of the running around. Sometimes I feel like the peopleat the drive-through know me by name! My husband helpsout on the weekends, but during the week, it's all me.\" Whatfactors may be influencing Sophia's health? How might thesefactors be influencing the health of her family?11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 17women with congenital heart disease did not live long enough to become pregnant. However, with new surgicaltechniques to correct the defects, many of these womensurvive and become pregnant, progressing through theirpregnancy without signicant problems. While positive and exciting, these advances and trends also pose new challenges for the health care commu-nity. For example, as health care for premature new-borns im proves and survival rates increase, the incidence of long-term chronic conditions such as respiratory airwaydysfunction or developmental delays has also increased. Asa result, nurses are faced with caring for clients at all stagesalong the health-illness continuum. Empowerment of Health Care Consumers Due to the influence of managed care, the focus on pre- vention, a more educated population, and technologicaladvances, individuals and families have taken an in-creased responsibility for their own health. Health con-sumers are now better informed, and they want to playa greater role in managing health and illness. Familieswant information about illnesses and they want to par-ticipate in making decisions about treatment options.As client advocates valuing family-centered care, nursesare instrumental in promoting this empowerment. Todo this, the nurse should respect the family's views andconcerns, address all issues and concerns, consider thefamily members as important participants, and alwaysinclude the woman and her family in the decision-makingprocess. Barriers to Health Care Women are major consumers of health care services, inmany cases arranging not only their own care but alsothat of family members. Compared with men, womenhave more health problems, longer life spans, and moresignicant reproductive health needs. Access to care canbe jeopardized by lower incomes and greater responsibil-ities (juggling work and family). Lack of nances or trans-portation, language or cultural barriers, inconvenient clinichours, and poor attitudes by health care workers oftendiscourage clients from seeking health care. Finances Financial barriers are one of the most important factorsthat limit care. Many women have limited or no healthinsurance and cannot afford to pay for care. AlthoughMedicaid covers prenatal care in most states, the paper-work and enrollment process can be so overwhelmingthat many women do not register. Many families do nothave health insurance, do not have enough insurance tocover the services they need, or cannot pay for services.18 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING Transportation Getting to and from appointments can be challenging for clients who do not drive or own a car or cannot use pub-lic transportation (if there is public transportation in thearea). It can be difcult for these clients to attend all rec-ommended prenatal health care visits, especially if thewoman has other small children who must be taken alongon the visit. These challenges can reduce the adherenceto scheduled appointments and follow-up. Language and Culture Language is how people communicate with each otherto increase their understanding or knowledge. If a healthcare worker cannot speak the same language as the clientor does not have a trained interpreter available, a barrieris created. The client's complaints can be misinterpretedor ignored or their significance can be misconstrued.The language barrier might prevent the client from ac-cessing the necessary care, such as prenatal care or pre-ventative care. Sociocultural and ethnic factors also pose barriers to health care. These factors may involve the lack of trans-portation, nancial situations that require both partnersto work, or genetic factors. Knowledge barriers (e.g., lackof understanding of the importance of prenatal care orchild health promotion) and spiritual barriers (e.g., someforms of treatment are proscribed by religions) also crossall ethnic groups. Health Care Delivery System The health care delivery system itself can create barriers. Eighty-ve percent of employed families with insuranceare covered by some type of managed health care plan orhealth maintenance organization (HMO). This prospec-tive payment system based on diagnosis-related groups(DRGs) limits the amounts of health care the family mayreceive. This also includes Medicaid reimbursement.Due to cost-containment efforts, the trend is to discharge clients as soon as possible from the hospital and to de-liver care in the home or through community-based serv-ices. Although overall insurance plans may improve accessto preventive services, they may limit access to specialtycare\u2014which greatly affects clients with chronic or long-term illnesses. Clinic hours must meet the needs of the clients, not the health care providers who work there. Evening orweekend hours might be needed to meet the schedules ofworking clients. Clinic personnel should evaluate theavailability and accessibility of the services they offer. Unfortunately, some health care workers exhibit neg- ative attitudes toward poor or culturally diverse families,and this could deter these clients from seeking healthcare. Long delays, hurried examinations, and rude com-ments by staff discourage clients from returning.11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 18CHAPTER 1 PERSPECTIVES ON MATERNAL , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SHEALTH CARE 19 Medical and surgical modalities are available to ter- minate a pregnancy, depending on how far the pregnancyhas developed. A surgical intervention can be performedup to 14 weeks' gestation; a medical intervention can beperformed up to 9 weeks' gestation (Shannon & Winikoff,2008). All women undergoing abortion need emotionalsupport, a stable environment in which to recover, andnonjudgmental care throughout. Abortion is a complex issue, and the controversy is not only in the public arena: many nurses struggle withthe conflict between their personal convictions and theirprofessional duty. Nurses are taught to be supportiveclient advocates and to interact with a nonjudgmentalattitude under all circumstances. However, nurses havetheir own personal and political views, which may bevery different from those of their clients. Nurses need toclarify their personal values and beliefs on this issue andmust be able to provide nonbiased care before assumingresponsibility for clients who might be in a position toconsider abortion. Their decision to care for or refuse tocare for such clients affects staff unity, influences stafngdecisions, and challenges the ethical concept of duty(Trybulski, 2006). The ANA's Code of Ethics for Nurses upholds the nurse's right to refuse to care for a client undergoing anabortion if the nurse ethically opposes the procedure(ANA, 2005). Nurses need to make their values and beliefsknown to their managers before the situation occurs so thatalternative stafng arrangements can be made. Open com-munication and acceptance of the personal beliefs ofothers can promote a comfortable working environment. Substance Abuse Substance abuse for any person is a problem, but when itinvolves a pregnant woman, substance abuse can causefetal injury and thus has legal and ethical implications. Insome instances, courts have issued jail sentences to preg-nant women who caused harm to their fetuses. Manystate laws require reporting evidence of prenatal drugexposure, which may lead to charges of negligence andchild endangerment against the pregnant woman. Thispunitive approach to fetal injury raises ethical and legalquestions about the degree of governmental control thatis appropriate in the interests of child safety. Fetal Therapy Intrauterine fetal surgery is a procedure that involvesopening the uterus during pregnancy, performing a sur-gery, and replacing the fetus in the uterus. Although therisks to the fetus and the mother are both great, fetal ther-apy may be used to correct anatomic lesions (Chervenak& McCullough, 2007). Some argue that medical technol-ogy should not interfere with nature, and thus this inter-vention should not take place. Others would argue thatthe surgical intervention improves the child's quality ofConsider THIS! I was a 17-year-old pregnant migrant worker needing prenatal care. Although my English wasn't good, I wasable to show the receptionist my \"big belly\" and ask forservices. All the receptionist seemed interested in was asocial security number and health insurance\u2014neither ofwhich I had. She proceeded to ask me personal ques-tions concerning who the father was and commented onhow young I looked. The receptionist then \"ordered\" mein a loud voice to sit down and wait for an answer bysomeone in the back, but never contacted anyone that Icould see. It seemed to me like all eyes were on me whileI found an empty seat in the waiting room. After sittingthere quietly for over an hour without any attention oranswer, I left. Thoughts: Why did she leave before receiving any health care service? What must she have been feelingduring her wait? Would you come back to this clinicagain? Why or why not? Legal and Ethical Issues in Maternal, Newborn, andWomen's Health Care Law and ethics are interrelated and affect all of nursing. Professional nurses must understand their scope of practice,standards of care, institutional or agency policies, and statelaws. All nurses are responsible for knowing current infor-mation regarding ethics and laws related to their practice. Several areas are of particular importance to the health care of women and their families. These includeabortion, substance abuse, fetal therapy, informed con-sent, and condentiality. Abortion Abortion was a volatile legal, social, and political issueeven before Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court deci- sion that legalized abortion. Forty-nine percent of preg-nancies in American women are unintended, and 40%of them are terminated by abortion (Alan GuttmacherInstitute, 2007). Abortion is one of the most common procedures performed in the United States. It has become a hotlydebated political issue that separates people into twocamps: pro-choice and pro-life. The pro-choice groupsupports the right of any woman to make decisions abouther reproductive functions based on her own moral andethical beliefs. The pro-life group feels strongly that abor-tion is murder and deprives the fetus of the basic right tolife. Both sides will continue to debate this very emotionalissue for years to come.11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 19life. For many people, these are the subjects of debates and intellectual discussions, but for nurses, these proce-dures may be part of their daily routine. Nurses play an important supportive role in caring and advocating for clients and their families. As the useof technology grows, situations will surface more fre-quently that test a nurse's belief system. Encouragingopen discussions to address emotional issues and differ-ences of opinion among staff members is healthy and in-creases tolerance for differing points of view. Informed Consent Informed consent has four key components: disclosure,comprehension, competency, and voluntariness (Cressey,2008). It occurs prior to initiation of the procedure orspecic care and addresses the legal and ethical require-ment of informing the client about the procedure. Thephysician or advanced practice nurse is responsible forinforming the client about the procedure and obtainingconsent by providing a detailed description of the proce-dure or treatment, its potential risks and benets, and al-ternative methods available. The nurse's responsibilityrelated to informed consent includes: Ensuring that the consent form is completed with sig- natures from the client Serving as a witness to the signature process Determining whether the client understands what she is signing by asking her pertinent questions Although laws vary from state to state, certain key elements are associated with informed consent (Box 1.4).Nurses need to be familiar with their specic state laws aswell as the policies and procedures of the health careagency where they work. Treating clients without obtain-ing proper consent may result in charges of assault, andthe health care provider and/or facility may be held liablefor any damages. Generally, only people over the age of20 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING majority (18 years of age) can legally provide consent for health care. Most care rendered in a health care setting is covered by the initial consent for treatment signed when the indi-vidual becomes a client at that ofce or clinic or by theconsent to treatment signed upon admission to the hospi-tal or other inpatient facility. Certain procedures, how-ever, require a specic process of informed consent: majorand minor surgery; invasive procedures such as amnio-centesis or internal fetal monitoring; treatments placingthe client at higher risk, such as chemotherapy or radia-tion therapy; procedures or treatments involving research;and photography involving the client. If the client cannot provide consent, then the person closest to the client may give consent for emergency treat-ment. In an emergency, a verbal consent, via the telephone,may be obtained. Two witnesses must also be listeningsimultaneously and must sign the consent form, indicat-ing that consent was received via telephone. Refusal of Medical Treatment All clients have the right to refuse medical treatment, based on the American Hospital Association's Bill ofRights. Ideally, medical care without informed consentshould be used only when the client's life is in danger.Clients may refuse treatment if it conflicts with their religious or cultural beliefs. In these cases, it is impor-tant to educate the client and family about the impor-tance of the recommended treatment without coercingor forcing the client to agree. Sometimes common ground may be reached between the family's religious or cul-tural beliefs and the health care team's recommenda-tions. Communication and education are the keys inthis situation. Condentiality With the establishment of the Health Insurance Portabil- ity and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, the con-dentiality of health care information is now mandated bylaw. The primary intent of the law is to protect health in-surance coverage for workers and their families when theychange or lose jobs. Another aspect of the law requiresDHHS to establish national standards for electronictransmission of health information. The plan also ad-dresses the security and privacy of health information. Forexample, no information that clearly identies a client canbe on public display, including information on a client'schart. In maternal and newborn health care, informationis shared only with the client, legal partner, parents, legalguardians, or individuals as established in writing by theclient or the child's parents. This law promotes the secu-rity and privacy of health care and health information forall clients. Client information should always be kept con-dential in the context of the state law, as well as the in-stitution's policies. BOX 1.4 Key Elements of Informed Consent The decision-maker must be of legal age in that state, with full civil rights, and must be competent (have theability to make the decision). Information is presented in a manner that is simple, concise, and appropriate to the level of education andlanguage of the individual responsible for making thedecision. The decision must be voluntary, without coercion or force or under duress. There must be a witness to the process of informed consent. The witness must sign the consent form.11223-01_UT01-CH01.qxd 8/4/08 2:35 PM Page 20Exceptions to condentiality exist. For example, sus- picion of physical or sexual abuse and injuries caused bya weapon or criminal act must be reported to the properauthorities. Abuse cases are reported to the appropriatewelfare authorities, whereas criminal acts are reportedto the police. The health care provider must also followpublic health laws related to reporting certain infectiousdiseases to the local health department (e.g., tuberculo-sis, hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infec-tions). Finally, there is a duty to warn third parties whenthere is a specic threat to an identiable person. Theremust be a balance between condentiality and requireddisclosure. If health care information must be disclosedby law, the client must be informed that this will occur(Brous, 2007). Implications for Nurses The health care system is intricately woven into the po-litical and social structure of our society, and nursesshould understand social, legal, and ethical health care is-sues so that they can play an active role in meeting thehealth care needs of women and their families. Nursesneed to take a proactive role in advocating for and em-powering their clients. For example, nurses can helpwomen to increase control over the factors that affecthealth, thereby improving their health status. A womanmay become empowered by developing skills not only tocope with her environment, but also to change it. Nursesalso can assume this mentoring role with families, thushelping them to improve their overall health status andhealth outcomes. Nurses must have a solid knowledge base about the factors affecting maternal, newborn, and women's healthand barriers to health care. They can use this informationto provide anticipatory guidance, health counseling, andteaching for women and their families. It also is useful inidentifying high-risk groups so that interventions can beinitiated early on, before problems occur. When caring for women and their families, the nurse operates within the framework of the nursingprocess, which is applicable to all health care settings.Maternal, newborn, and women's health nursing isever-changing as globalization and the exchange of infor-mation expands. Nurses must remain up to date aboutnew technologies and treatments and integrate high-quality, evidence-based interventions into the care theyprovide. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Maternal, newborn, and women's health nurses pro- vide care using a philosophy that focuses on the fam-ily and the use of evidence-based practice in a casemanagement environment to provide quality, cost-effective care./H18546Healthy People 2010 presents a national set of health goals and objectives for adults and children that focuson health promotion and disease prevention. /H18546One method to establish the aggregate health status of women and infants is with statistical data, such as mor-tality and morbidity rates. /H18546The infant mortality rate is the lowest in the history of the United States, but it is still higher than that ofother industrialized countries.

Some clients come for their initial prenatalintake appointment and never come back. You real-ize that some just forget their appointments, but mostdon't even call to notify you. Many of the clients arehigh risk and thus are jeopardizing their health andthe health of their future child. a.What changes might be helpful to address this situation? b.Outline what you might say at your next staff meeting to address the issue of clients making oneclinic visit and then never returning. c.What strategies might you use to improveattendance and notication? d.Describe what cultural and customer service techniques might be needed. STUDYACTIVITIES 1.Research a current policy, bill, or issue being debatedon the community, state, or national level that per-tains to the health and welfare of women or theirfamilies. Summarize the major facts and supportingand opposing arguments and prepare an oral reporton your ndings. 2.Within your clinical group, debate the followingstatement: Should access to health care be a right ora privilege? 3.Visit a local community health center that offers serv-ices to women and their families from various cul-tures.

Dur-ing the past several years, the health care delivery systemhas changed dramatically. With a focus on cost contain-ment, people are spending less time in the hospital. Clientsare being discharged \"sicker and quicker\" from theirhospital beds. The health care system has moved fromreactive treatment strategies in hospitals to a proactiveapproach in the community. This has resulted in an increasing emphasis on health promotion and illness pre-vention within the community. Nurses play an important role in the health and well- ness of a community. They not only meet the health careneeds of the individual but also go beyond that to imple-ment interventions that affect the community as a whole.Nurses practice in a variety of settings within a community,such as clinics and physician ofces, shelters, churches,health departments, community health centers, andhomes. They promote the health of individuals, families,groups, communities, and populations and promote anenvironment that supports health. This chapter describes the concepts of community and community-based nursing, addressing the varied set-tings where such care is provided to women and theirfamilies. The chapter also highlights the major roles andfunctions of community-based nurses, emphasizing theirrole as educators in health promotion and maintenance. Family-Centered Care Family-centered cares refers to the collaborative partner- ship among the individual, family, and caregivers to determine goals, share information, offer support, andformulate plans for health care (Chia-Chen & Thompson,2007). Key elements in the provision of family-centeredcare include demonstrating interpersonal sensitivity, pro-viding general health information and being a valuableresource, communicating specic health information, andtreating people respectfully (Mullen et al., 2007). Thephilosophy of family-centered care recognizes the familyas the constant: the health of all the family members andtheir functional abilities influence the health of the clientand other members of the family. Family-centered careworks well in all arenas of health care, from preventivecare to long-term care. Family-centered care enhances thecondence of all those involved about their skills andhelps to prepare individuals for assuming responsibilityfor their own health care needs. It is vital for the nurse toassess how much knowledge the family already has aboutthe client's health or illness. Using a family-centered approach is associated with positive outcomes such as decreased anxiety, improvedpain management, shorter recovery times, and enhancedcondence and problem-solving skills. Communicationbetween the health care team and the family is also im-proved, leading to greater satisfaction for both health care providers and health care consumers (families). Practic-ing true family-centered care may empower the family,strengthen family resources, and help the woman or childfeel more secure throughout the process. Community-Based Care Community may be dened as a specic group of people, often living in a dened geographical area, who share com-mon interests, who interact with each other, and who func-tion collectively within a dened social structure to addresscommon concerns (Clark, 2008). The common featuresof a community may be common rights and privileges asmembers of a certain city or common ties of identity, val-ues, norms, culture, language, or social support. Womenare caregivers to children, parents, spouses, and neighborsand provide important social support in these roles. A person can be a part of many communities during the course of daily life. Examples might include area ofresidence (home, apartment, shelter), gender, place ofemployment (organization or home), language spoken(Spanish, Chinese, English), educational background orstudent status, culture (Italian, African-American, In-dian), career (nurse, businesswoman, housewife), place ofworship (church or synagogue), and community member-ships (garden club, YMCA, support group, school PTA,youth organizations, athletic teams). In community-based care, the community is the unit of service. The providers of care are concerned not onlywith the clients who present for service but also with thelarger population of potential or at-risk clients. Community Health Nursing Community health nursing focuses on preventing illness and improving the health of populations and communities.Population is dened as a group of people who may or maynot interact with each other within a dened geographicallocation (Clark, 2008). Community health nurses work ingeographically and culturally diverse settings. They ad-dress current and potential health needs of the populationor community. They promote and preserve the health of apopulation and are not limited to particular age groups ordiagnoses. Public health nursing is a specialized area ofcommunity health nursing. Epidemiology (the study of the causes, distribution, and control of disease in populations) can help determinethe health and health needs of a population and assist inplanning health services. Community health nurses per-form epidemiologic investigations to help analyze anddevelop health policy and community health initiatives.Community health initiatives can be focused on thecommunity as a whole or a specic target population withspecic needs. Healthy People 2010 (HP 2010) is an exam- ple of national health initiatives developed using the epi-demiological process. HP 2010 ensures that health careW11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 25professionals evaluate the individual as well as the com- munity. It emphasizes the ever-present link between theindividual's health and the health of the community(Clark, 2007; Zahner & Block, 2006). HP 2010 identiestwo major goals: to increase the quality of life and the lifeexpectancy of individuals of all ages and to decrease healthdisparities among different populations. Relevant HP 2010objectives are highlighted throughout this text, and HP2010 is available online at www.healthypeople.gov. The focus of health care initiatives today is on peo- ple and their needs, strengthening their abilities to shapetheir own lives. The emphasis has shifted away from de-pendence on health professionals toward personal in-volvement and personal responsibility, and this givesnurses the opportunity to interact with individuals in a variety of self-help roles. Nurses in the community canbe the primary force in identifying the challenges and implementing changes in women's and newborn's healthfor the future. Community-Based Nursing In the past, the only community-based roles for nurses were community health nurses or public health nurses.This is now a subset of what is considered community-based nursing. The health needs of the society and con-sumer demand brought about community-based andcommunity-focused services. The movement from an illness-oriented \"cure\" perspective in hospitals to afocus on health promotion and primary health care incommunity- based settings has dramatically changed em- ployment opportunities for today's nurses. This shift inemphasis to primary care and outpatient treatment andmanagement will likely continue. As a result, employmentgrowth in a variety of community-based settings can beexpected for properly educated nurses. The 2004 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services[USDHHS], Bureau of Health Professions, 2004) foundthe following trends in registered nurse (RN) employ-ment settings: 44% of RNs work outside the hospital setting. The number of RNs employed in community-based settings showed a 35% increase between 2000 and2004; this was largely the result of an increase innurses working in home health care and managed careorganizations. Community-based nursing settings include ambula- tory care, home health care, occupational health, schoolhealth, and hospice settings (Table 2.1). Clinical practicewithin the community may also include case manage-ment, research, quality improvement, and discharge plan-ning. Nurses with advanced practice and experience maybe employed in areas of staff development, program de-velopment, and community education.26 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING Community-Based Nursing Interventions Nursing interventions involve any treatment that the nurse performs to enhance the client's outcome. Nursingpractice in the community uses the nursing process and issimilar to that in the acute care setting, because assessing,performing procedures, administering medications, coor-dinating services and equipment, counseling clients andtheir families, and teaching about care are all part of thecare administered by nurses in the community. Box 2.1highlights the most common nursing interventions usedin community-based nursing practice. Community-Based Nursing Challenges Despite the benefits achieved by caring for families intheir own homes and communities, challenges alsoexist. Clients are being discharged from acute care facilities very early in their recovery course and presentwith more health care needs than in the past. As a result, nursing care and procedures in the home andcommunity are becoming more complex and time-consuming. Consider the example of a woman who Ambulatory care Doctor's ofces settings Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) Day surgery centersFreestanding urgent care centers Family planning clinicsMobile mammography centers Home health care High-risk pregnancy/ services neonate care Maternal/child newborn careSkilled nursing careHospice care Health Department Maternal/child health clinics services Family planning clinics Sexually transmitted infection programs Immunization clinicsSubstance-abuse programsJails and prisons Long-term care Skilled nursing facilities Nursing homesHospicesAssisted living Other community- Parish nursing programs based settings Summer camps Childbirth education programsSchool health Page 26developed a systemic infection, a pelvic abscess, and deep vein thrombosis in her leg after a cesarean birthwho is being discharged from the hospital. The nurse'sprimary focus of care in this situation would be to ad-minister heparin and antibiotics intravenously ratherthan educating her about childcare and follow-up ap-pointments. In the past, this woman would have re-mained hospitalized for treatment, but home infusiontherapy is now less costly and allows the client to be dis- charged sooner. This demand on the nurse's time may limit the amount of time spent on prevention measures, educa-tion, and the family's psychosocial issues. More time maybe needed to help families deal with these issues and con-cerns. With large client caseloads, nurses may nd it dif-cult to spend the time needed while meeting the timerestrictions dictated by their health care agencies. Nursesneed to plan the tasks to be accomplished (Box 2.2). Nurses working in the community have fewer re- sources available to them compared with the acute caresetting. Decisions often have to be made in isolation.The nurse must possess excellent assessment skills and the ability to communicate effectively with the fam-ily to be successful in carrying out the appropriate planof care. Nurses interested in working in community-based settings must be able to apply the nursing process in anenvironment that is less structured or controlled than thatin acute care facilities. Nurses must be able to assimilateinformation well beyond the immediate physical andpsychosocial needs of the client in a controlled acutecare setting and deal with environmental threats, lifestylechoices, family issues, different cultural patterns, nancialburdens, transportation problems, employment hazards,communication barriers, limited resources, and clientacceptance and compliance. Although opportunities for employment in community- based settings are plentiful, many positions require a bac-calaureate degree. Previous medical-surgical expe rience in an acute care setting is typically required by home health agencies because these nurses must function fairlyindependently within the home environment. The nurse must also be familiar with and respectful of many different cultures and socioeconomic levels, remain-ing objective in dealing with such diversity and demon-strating an understanding of and appreciation for culturaldifferences. Interventions must be individualized to ad-dress the cultural, social, and economic diversity amongclients in their own environment (Papadopoulos, 2006). Shift in Responsibilities From Hospital-Based to Community-Based Nursing Community care, especially home care, is a rapidly growing service in the United States. Community-basedcare has been shown to be a cost-effective method forproviding care. An increase in disposable income andthe increased longevity of individuals with chronic anddebilitating health conditions have also contributed tothe continued shift of health care to the community andhome setting. Technology has advanced, allowing forimproved monitoring of clients in community settingsand at home as well as allowing complicated proceduresto be done at home, such as intravenous administrationof antibiotics.BOX 2.1 Community-Based Nursing Interventions Health screening\u2014detecting unrecognized or preclini- cal illness among individuals so they can be referredfor denitive diagnosis and treatment (e.g., mammo-gram or Pap smear, vision and hearing checks) Health education programs\u2014assisting clients in making health-related decisions about self-care, use of healthresources, and social health issues such as smoking bansand motorcycle helmet laws (e.g., childbirth educationor breast self-examination, drug awareness programs) Medication administration\u2014preparing, giving, and evaluating the effectiveness of prescription and over-the-counter drugs (e.g., hormone replacement therapyin menopausal women) Telephone consultation\u2014identifying the problem to be addressed; listening and providing support, informa-tion, or instruction; documenting advice/instructionsgiven to concerns raised by caller (e.g., consultation fora mother with a newborn with colic, interaction with aparent whose child has a fever or is vomiting) Health system referral\u2014passing along information about the location, services offered, and ways to con-tact agencies (e.g., referring a woman for a breastprosthesis after a mastectomy) Instructional\u2014teaching an individual or a group about a medication, disease process, lifestyle changes, com-munity resources, or research ndings concerningtheir environment (e.g., childbirth education class,basic life support classes for parents) Nutritional counseling\u2014demonstrating the direct rela- tionship between nutrition and illness while focusingon the need for diet modication to promote wellness(e.g., Women, Infants, and Children [WIC] program;counselor interviewing a pregnant woman who hasanemia) Risk identication\u2014recognizing personal or group characteristics that predispose people to develop a specic health problem, and modifying or eliminatingthem (e.g., genetic counseling of an older pregnantwoman at risk for a Down syndrome infant; geneticscreening of family members for cystic brosis orHuntington's disease) Dochterman, J.

The emphasis on health care de-livery in community-based settings has moved beyondprimary preventive health care (e.g., well-child checkups,routine physical examinations, prenatal care, and treat-ment of common acute illnesses) and now encompassessecondary and tertiary care. Primary Prevention The concept of primary prevention involves preventingthe disease or condition before it occurs through healthpromotion activities, environmental protection, and spe-cic protection against disease or injury. It encompassesa vast array of areas, including nutrition, good hygiene,sanitation, immunization, adequate shelter, smoking ces-sation, family planning, and the use of seat belts (Fig. 2.1;Stanhope & Lancaster, 2008).Prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), such as anencephaly and spina bida, is an example of primaryprevention. The use of folic acid supplementation daily for3 months before and 3 months after conception reducesthe risk of first occurrence of NTD (American Collegeof Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], 2007). Allwomen of childbearing age should take 0.4 mg folic aciddaily as soon as they plan to become pregnant and shouldcontinue taking it throughout the pregnancy to preventthis devastating condition. Giving anticipatory guidance toparents about poison prevention and safety during play isanother example of primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention is the early detection and treatmentof adverse health conditions. Health screenings are themainstay of secondary prevention. Pregnancy testing,blood pressure evaluations, cholesterol monitoring, fecaloccult blood testing, breast examinations, mammogra-phy screening, hearing and vision examinations, andBOX 2.2 Home Care Visitation Planning Review previous interventions to eliminate unsuccessful ones. Check previous home visit narrative to validate interventions. Communicate with previous nurse to ask questions and clarify. Formulate plan of interventions based on data received (e.g., client preference of IV placement or order of fluids). Prioritize client needs based on their potential to threaten the client's health status. Use Maslow's hierarchy of needs to set forth a plan of care. Address life-threatening physiologic issues rst (e.g., an infectious process would take precedence over anorexia). Develop goals that reflect primary, secondary, and terti- ary prevention levels.Primary prevention \u2014Have the patient consume adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Secondary prevention \u2014Administer drug therapy as prescribed to contain and treat an existing infectiousprocess. Tertiary prevention \u2014Instruct the client on good hand- washing technique to prevent spread and future sec-ondary infections. Bear in mind the client's readiness to accept intervention and education. Ascertain the client's focus and how see sees her needs. Address client issues that might interfere with interven- tion (e.g., if the client is in pain, attempting to teach herabout her care will be lost; her pain must be addressedrst before she is ready to learn). Consider the timing of the visit to prevent interfering with other client activities. Schedule all visits at convenient times per client if possi- ble (e.g., if the client has a favorite soap opera to watch,attempt to schedule around that event if at all possible). Reschedule a home visit if a client event comes up suddenly. Outline nursing activities to be completed during the scheduled visit. Know the health care agency's policy and procedures for home visits. Consider the time line and other visits scheduled that day. Research evidence-based best practices to use in the home (e.g., if the client is fatigued, be flexible to accom-modate her needs and allow for periods of rest so thatshe may conserve her energy). Obtain necessary materials/supplies before making the visit. Assemble all equipment needed for any procedure in advance. Secure any equipment that might be needed if a prob- lem occurs (e.g., bring additional IV tubing and acatheter to make sure the procedure can be carried outwithout delay). Determine criteria to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the home visit. Revisit outcome goals to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Assess the client's health status to validate improvement. Monitor changes in the client's behavior toward health promotion activities and disease prevention (e.g., verify/observe that the client demonstrates correct hand-washingtechnique after instruction and reinforcement during thehome care visit).11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 28Papanicolaou (Pap) smears are examples of this level of prevention. Such interventions do not prevent thehealth problem but are intended for early detection andprompt treatment to prevent complications (Anderson& McFarlane, 2007). Tertiary Prevention Tertiary prevention is designed to reduce or limit the progression of a disease or disability. The purpose of terti-ary prevention is to restore individuals to their maximumpotential (Anderson & McFarlane, 2007). Tertiary preven-tion measures are supportive and restorative. For example,tertiary prevention efforts would focus on minimizing andmanaging the effects of a chronic illness such as cerebro-vascular disease or the chronic effects of sexually transmit-ted infections (e.g., herpes, human immunodeficiencyvirus [HIV], and untreated syphilis). Another examplewould involve working with women who have suffered long-term consequences of violence. The focus of thenurse would be to maximize the woman's strengths, tohelp her recover from the trauma and loss, and to buildsupport systems. The Nurse's Role in Community-Based Preventive Care All health professionals have a special role in health pro- motion, health protection, and disease prevention. Muchof community nursing involves prevention, early identi-cation, and prompt treatment of health problems andmonitoring for emerging threats that might lead to healthproblems. Community-based nurses provide health carefor women and their families at all three levels of preven-tion. This care often involves advocating for services tomeet their needs. Cultural Issues in Community-Based Nursing The United States contains an ever-changing mix of cultural groups. The Yearbook of Immigration Statis- tics(United States Department of Homeland Security [USDHS], 2006) reports that the U.S. immigrant pop-ulation has reached 38 million, with people arrivingfrom every corner of the world. A B CCHAPTER 2 FAMILY-CENTERED COMMUNITY -BASEDCARE 29 FIGURE 2.1Levels of prevention in community-based nurs- ing. ( A) At the primary prevention level, the nurse provides a woman with teaching about breast self-examination. ( B) At the secondary level of prevention, a woman undergoes a mam-mogram for early detection of breast problems. ( C) At the tertiary level of prevention, a nurse assists a client with herstrength exercises. Take NOTE! One million immigrants come to the United States each year, and more than half are of childbearing age. Latin America accountsfor more than 50% of immigrants to the United States.By the year 2050, people of African, Asian, and Latinobackgrounds will make up one half of our population(U.S. Census Bureau, 2007).11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 2930 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING BOX 2.3 Steps to Developing Cultural Competence 1. Cultural Self-Awareness Become aware of, appreciate, and become sensitive to the values, beliefs, customs, and behaviors thathave shaped one's own culture. Engage in self-exploration beyond one's own culture and \"see\" clients from different cultures. Examine personal biases and prejudices toward other cultures. Become aware of differences in personal and clients' backgrounds. 2. Cultural Knowledge Learn about different cultures (e.g., books, continuing education courses, the Internet, culturaldiversity conferences). Become familiar with culturally/ethnically diverse groups, worldviews, beliefs, practices, lifestyles, andproblem-solving strategies. 3. Cultural Skills Learn how to perform a competent cultural assessment. Assess each client's unique cultural values, beliefs, and practices without depending solely on writtenfacts about specic cultural groups. 4. Cultural Encounter Engage in cross-cultural interactions with people from culturally diverse backgrounds, such as attend-ing religious services or ceremonies and participatingin important family events. Participate in as many cultural encounters as possible to avoid cultural stereotyping.This growing diversity has signicant implications for the health care system. For years nurses have struggledwith the issues of providing optimal health care that meetsthe needs of women and their families from varied culturesand ethnic groups. In addition to displaying competencein technical skills, nurses must also become competentin caring for clients from varied ethnic and racial back-grounds. Adapting to different cultural beliefs and practicesrequires flexibility and acceptance of others' viewpoints.Nurses must listen to clients and learn about their beliefsabout health and wellness. To provide culturally appro-priate care to diverse populations, nurses need to know, understand, and respect culturally influenced health be-haviors. Chapter 1 provides a more detailed discussion ofculture and its impact on the health of women, children,and families. Nurses must research and understand the cultural characteristics, values, and beliefs of the various peopleto whom they deliver care so that false assumptions andstereotyping do not lead to insensitive care. Time orien-tation, personal space, family orientation (patriarchal,matriarchal, or egalitarian), and language are importantcultural concepts. Culturally Competent Nursing Care Cultural competence is dened as the knowledge, will- ingness, and ability to adapt health care to enhance itsacceptability to and effectiveness with clients from diversecultures (Clark, 2007). Cultural competence is a dynamicprocess during which nurses obtain and then apply cul-tural information. Nurses must look at clients throughtheir own eyes and the eyes of clients and family members.Nurses must develop nonjudgmental acceptance of cul-tural differences in clients, using diversity as a strength thatempowers them to achieve mutually acceptable health caregoals (Kersey-Matusiak, 2006). This cultural awarenessallows nurses to see the entire picture and improves thequality of care and health outcomes. Cultural competence does not appear suddenly; it must be developed through a series of steps (Box 2.3). Barriers to Cultural Competence Barriers to cultural competence can be grouped into twocategories: those related to providers and those related tosystems (Godfrey, 2006). When a health care providerlacks knowledge of a client's cultural practices and beliefsor when the provider's beliefs differ from those of theclient, the provider may be unprepared to respond whenthe client makes unexpected health care decisions. System-related barriers can occur if agencies that have not beendesigned for cultural diversity want all clients to conformto the established rules and regulations and attempt to teveryone into the same mold. Cultural competence does not mean replacing one's own cultural identity with another, ignoring the variabilitywithin cultural groups, or even appreciating the culturesConsider THIS! Our medical mission took a team of nurse practitioners into the rural mountains of Guatemala to offer med-ical services to people who had never had any. Oneday, a distraught mother brought her 10-year-olddaughter to the mission clinic, asking me if there wasanything I could do about her daughter's right wrist.She had sustained a fracture a year ago and it had nothealed properly. As I looked at the girl's malformedwrist, I asked if it had been splinted to help with align-ment, knowing what the answer was going to be. Theinterpreter enlightened me by saying that this younggirl would never marry and have children because ofthis injury. I appeared puzzled at the interpreter's pre-diction of this girl's future. It was later explained to methat if the girl couldn't make tortes from corn meal forher husband because of her wrist disability, she would (continued)11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 30of life and in all areas of the community use CAM. Over- all, CAM use is seen more in women than men, and inpeople with higher educational levels. The annual out-of-pocket costs for CAM are estimated to exceed $27 billion.Prayer specically for health reasons is the most com-monly used CAM therapy (NCCAM, 2007). Researchindicates that more than 43% of adults use some form ofalternative practice, and one in three pregnant womenuse CAM therapies, some of which may be potentiallyharmful (Daniel, 2006). CAM includes diverse practices, products, and health care systems that are not currently considered to be partof conventional medicine (NCCAM, 2007). Complemen- tarymedicine is used together with conventional medi- cine, such as using aromatherapy to reduce discomfortafter surgery or to reduce pain during a procedure or dur-ing early labor. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine, such as eating a special naturaldiet to control nausea and vomiting or to treat cancer in-stead of undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, or radiationthat has been recommended by a conventional doctor. In- tegrative medicine combines mainstream medical thera- pies and CAM therapies for which there is some scienticevidence of safety and effectiveness (NCCAM, 2007).These include acupuncture, reflexology, th erapeutic touch, meditation, yoga, herbal therapies, nutritional supple-ments, homeopathy, naturopathic medicine, and manymore used for the promotion of health and well-being(Pearson & Chesney, 2007). Table 2.2 describes selectedCAM therapies and treatments. The theoretic underpinnings of complementary and alternative health practices propose that health and ill-ness are complex interactions of the mind, body, andspirit.

I reminded myself during the week of the medical mission not to impose my cultural values on the women for whom I was caring and to accept their culturalmores without judgment. These silent self-remindersserved me well throughout the week, for I was open tolearning about their lifestyles and customs. Thoughts: What must the young girl be feeling at the age of 10, being rejected for a disability that wasn'ther fault? What might have happened if I had imposed my value system on this patient? How effective wouldI have been in helping her if she didn't feel accepted?This incident ripped my heart out, for this young girlwill be deprived of a fullling family life based on awrist disability.

Instead, nurses skilled at cultural compe- tence show a respect for difference, an eagerness to learn,and a willingness to accept multiple views of the world(Streltzer & Tseng, 2008). Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is not unique to a specic ethnic or cultural group:interest in CAM therapies continues to grow nationwideand will affect care of many clients. People from all walks11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 3132 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING methods. This eld does not lend itself readily to scien- tic study or to investigation and therefore is not easilyembraced by many hard-core scientists (Tryens et al.,2007). Much of what we consider to be alternative med-icine comes from the Eastern world, folk medicine, andreligious and spiritual practices. There is no unifyingbasic theory for the numerous treatments or modalities,except (as noted previously) that health and illness areconsidered to be complex interactions among the body,mind, and spirit. Because of heightened interest in complementary treatments and their widening use, anecdotal efcacy, andgrowing supporting research evidence, nurses need to besensitive to and knowledgeable enough to answer manyof the questions clients ask and to guide them in a safe,objective way (Fowler & Newton, 2006). Nurses havea unique opportunity to provide services that facilitatewholeness. They need to understand all aspects of CAM,including costs, client knowledge, and drug interactions,if they are to promote holistic strategies for clients andfamilies. Many patients who use complementary or alternative therapies do not reveal this fact to their health careprovider. Therefore, one of the nurse's most importantroles during the assessment phase of the nursing processis to encourage clients to communicate their use of thesetherapies to eliminate the possibility of harmful inter-actions and contraindications with current medical thera-pies. When assessing clients, ask specic questions aboutany nonprescription medications they may be taking, in-cluding vitamins, minerals, or herbs. Clients should alsobe asked about any therapies they are taking that have notbeen ordered by their primary health care provider. When caring for clients and their families who prac- tice CAM, nurses need to: Be culturally sensitive to nontraditional treatments Acknowledge and respect different beliefs, attitudes, and lifestyles Keep an open mind, remembering that standard medical treatments do not work for all clients Accept CAM and integrate it if it brings comfort without harm Provide accurate information, not unsubstantiated opinions Advise clients how they can best monitor their condition using CAM Discourage practices only if they are harmful to the client's health Instruct the client to weigh the risks and benets of CAM use Avoid confrontation when asking clients about CAM Be reflective, nonjudgmental, and open-minded about CAM The use of complementary therapies is widespread, especially by women desiring to alleviate the nausea andvomiting of early pregnancy. Ginger tea, Sea-Bands, and vitamin B6 are typically used to treat morning sickness(Northrup, 2006). Although these may not cause any illeffects during the pregnancy, most substances ingestedcross the placenta and have the potential to reach thefetus, so nurses should stress to all pregnant women thatit is better to be cautious when using CAM. Women at risk for osteoporosis are seeking alterna- tives to hormone replacement therapy since the Women'sHealth Initiative (WHI) study raised doubts about thebenet of estrogen. Some of the alternative therapies forosteoporosis include soy isoflavones, progesterone cream,magnet therapy, tai chi, and hip protectors (Kessenich,2007). In addition, menopausal women may seek CAMtherapies for hot flashes. Once again, despite many claims,most of these therapies have not undergone scientic test-ing and thus could place the woman at risk. If clients are considering the use of or using CAM therapies, suggest they check with their health care pro-vider before taking any \"natural\" substance. Offer clientsthe following instructions: Do not take for granted that because a substance is a natural herb or plant product, it is benecial or harmless. Seek medical care when ill. Always inform the provider if you are taking herbs or other therapies. Avoid taking herbal remedies if you are pregnant or lactating. Be sure that any product package contains a list of all ingredients and amounts of each. Be aware that frequent or continual use of large doses of a CAM preparation is not advisable, and harm mayresult if therapies are mixed (e.g., vitamin E, garlic,and aspirin all have anticoagulant properties). Research CAM through resources such as books, web- sites, and articles (Clark & Collins, 2007). All nurses, especially nurses working in the commu- nity, must educate themselves about the pros and cons ofCAM and be prepared to discuss and help their clientsmake sense of it all. Expanding our consciousness by un-derstanding and respecting diverse cultures and CAMwill enable nurses to provide the best treatment for clientsand their families receiving community-based care. Community-Based Nursing Care Settings Community-based nursing takes place in a variety of set- tings, including physician's ofces, clinics, health depart-ments, urgent care centers, hospital outpatient centers,churches, shelters, and clients' homes. Nurses providewell care, episodic ill care, and chronic care. They work topromote, preserve, and improve the health of the womenand their families in these settings.11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 32CHAPTER 2 FAMILY-CENTERED COMMUNITY -BASEDCARE 33 Due to technological advances, cost containment, and shortened hospital stays, the home is a common care set-ting for women and families today. Home care is gearedtoward the needs of the client and family. Private-dutynursing care is used when more extensive care is needed;it may be delivered hourly (several hours per day) or on afull-time, live-in basis. Periodic nursing visits may be usedfor intermittent interventions, such as IV antibiotic admin-istration, follow-up client teaching, and monitoring. Thegoals of nursing care in the home setting include promot-ing, restoring, and maintaining the health of the client. Home care focuses on minimizing the effects of the illness or disability along with providing the client withthe means to care for the illness or disability at home.Nurses in the home care setting are direct care providers,educators, advocates, and case managers. Prenatal Care Early, adequate prenatal care has long been associated with improved pregnancy outcomes (March of Dimes,2008). Adequate prenatal care is a comprehensive processin which any problems associated with pregnancy are iden-tied and treated. Basic components of prenatal care areearly and continuing risk assessment, health promotion,medical and psychosocial interventions, and follow-up.Within the community setting, several services are avail- able to provide health care for pregnant women (Box 2.4). Not all women are aware of the community resources available to them. Most public health services are avail-able for consultation, local hospitals have \"hotlines\" forquestions, and public libraries have pregnancy-related re-sources as well as Internet access. Nurses can be a veryhelpful link to resources for all women regardless of theireconomic status. Technologically advanced care has been shown to im- prove maternal and infant outcomes. Regionalized high-risk care, recommended by the American Academy ofPediatrics in the late 1970s, aimed to promote uniformitynationwide, covering the prenatal care of high-risk preg-nancies and high-risk newborns. The advanced technol-ogy found in level III perinatal regional centers andcommunity-based prenatal surveillance programs have re-sulted in better risk-adjusted mortality rates (Britt, Edean,& Evans, 2006; Martin & Foley, 2006). For example, fetalmonitoring and ultrasound technology have traditionallybeen used in acute care settings to monitor the progress ofmany high-risk pregnancies. However, with the increasedcost of hospital stays, many services were moved to out-patient facilities and into the home. The intent was toreduce health care costs and to monitor women with com-plications of pregnancy in the home rather than in the BOX 2.4 Maternal Community Health Care Services State public health prenatal clinics provide access to care based on a sliding scale payment schedule or haveservices paid for by Medicaid. Federally funded community clinics typically offer a variety of services, which may include prenatal, pediatric,adult health, and dental services. A sliding scale paymentschedule or Medicaid may cover costs. Hospital outpatient health care services offer maternal- child health services. Frequently they are associated witha teaching hospital in which medical school students, in-terns, and OB/GYN residents rotate through the clinicservices to care for patients during their education process. Private OB/GYN ofces are available for women with health insurance seeking care during their pregnancies.Some physicians in private practice will accept Medicaidpatients as well as private patients. Community free clinics offer maternal-child services in some communities for women with limited economic resources (homeless, unemployed). Freestanding birth centers offer prenatal care for low- risk mothers as well as childbirth classes to educate couples regarding the birthing process. Most centers ac-cept private insurance and Medicaid for reimbursementservices. Midwifery services are available in many communities where midwives provide women's health services. Theyusually accept a multitude of payment plans from privatepay to health insurance to Medicaid for reimbursementpurposes. WIC provides food, nutrition counseling, and access to health services for low-income women, infants, andchildren. WIC is a federally funded program and is ad-ministered by each state. All persons receiving Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children (AFDC), foodstamps, or Medicaid are automatically eligible for WIC.An estimated 45% of the infants born in the UnitedStates are served by WIC (USDA Food and NutritionService, 2004). Childbirth classes offer pregnant women and their part- ners a series of educational classes on childbirth prepara-tion. Women attend them during their last trimester ofpregnancy. Some classes are free and some have a fee. Local La Leche League groups provide mother-to-mother support for breast-feeding, nutrition, and infant careproblem-solving strategies. All women who have an in-terest in breast-feeding are welcome to participate in themeetings, which are typically held in the home of a La Leche member.11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 3334 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING hospital. Examples of services offered in the home setting might include: Infusion therapy to treat infections or combat dehydration Hypertension monitoring for women with gestational hypertension Uterine monitoring for mothers who are at high risk for preterm labor Fetal monitoring to evaluate fetal well-being Portable ultrasound to perform a biophysical prole to assess fetal well-being As a result, home care has the potential to produce cost savings compared to inpatient care. Labor and Birth Care Pregnancy involves numerous choices: cloth or dispos- able diapers, breastfeeding or bottle feeding, doctor ormidwife, and where to give birth\u2014at a birthing center, athome, or at a hospital. Deciding where to give birth de-pends on the woman's pregnancy risk status. For the pregnant woman who is at high risk as a result of medicalor social factors, the hospital is considered the safestplace for birth. Potential complications can be addressedbecause medical technology, skilled professionals, andneonatal services are available. For low-risk women, afreestanding birthing center or a home birth is an option. The choice between a birthing center, home birth, or hospital depends on the woman's preferences, her riskstatus, and her distance from a hospital. Some womenchoose an all-natural birth with no medications and nomedical intervention, whereas others would feel morecomfortable in a setting in which medications and trainedstaff are available if needed. Presenting the facts to women and allowing them to choose in collaboration with theirhealth care provider is the nurse's role. Safety is para-mount, but at the same time nurses must protect thewoman's right to select birth options and should pro-mote family-centered care in all maternity settings (see Evidence-Based Practice 2.1). Hodnett, D. D., Downe, S., Edwards, N., & Walsh, D. (2005). Home-like versus conventional institu- tional settings for birth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005. Issue 1. Art. No.: CD000012. DOI:10.1002/14651858.CD000012.pub2.Women have been giving birth to newborns in the home setting since the beginning of time; giving birth in an insti-tution has been the norm only since the early 20th century.These institutions continue to be the primary setting forbirth, but with the growing emphasis on the client as aconsumer of health care and the desire for family-centeredcare, greater numbers of facilities are attempting to incorporate some of the home birth components into their delivery of care. Study A study was done to compare the effect of care in ahome-like institutional birth setting versus a conventionalinstitutional birth setting. Two researchers using standardmethods for data collection and analysis compiled informa-tion from all randomized and quasi-randomized controlledtrials involving a comparison of home-like institutional and conventional institutional birth settings. In addition, the re-searchers evaluated eight journals and two published con-ference proceedings. Six trials that involved 8,677 womenwere included. The researchers were unable to include information related to freestanding birthing centers be-cause they found no trials on this topic. The researchersreported the results using relative risk and 95% con-dence intervals.Findings Women giving birth in home-like institutional birth settings were less likely to receive or require intrapartum analgesiaor anesthesia, less likely to have an episiotomy, and morelikely to experience a spontaneous vaginal birth. They weremore likely to choose the same setting for future births,they were more satised with intrapartum care, and theywere more likely to initiate breastfeeding and continue it forthe next 6 to 8 weeks. However, they also had an increasedrisk for vaginal or perineal tears and the risks for perinatalmortality were increased. Nursing Implications This study identied several important benets that nursescan integrate into their practice when counseling andteaching pregnant women about birthing options. How-ever, nurses need to stress the increased risk for perinatalmortality with this option so that women can make in-formed decisions about their choice of birth setting. Nurses also can provide input about incorporating a more \"home-like\" atmosphere when their facilities are designingnew birthing areas. In addition, nurses can advocate forthe pregnant woman in labor to ensure that she has free-dom to move about the birthing area, allowing her to feelmore \"at home.\" EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 2.1 Home-Like Institutional Birth Settings Conventional Institutional Birth Settings11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 34Birthing Center A birthing center is a cross between a home birth and a hospital. Birthing centers offer a homelike setting but withclose proximity to a hospital in case of complications.Midwives often are the sole care providers in freestandingbirthing centers, with obstetricians as backups in case ofemergencies. Birthing centers usually have fewer restric-tions and guidelines for families to follow and allow formore freedom in making decisions about labor. The ratesof cesarean birth and the costs are much lower than thoseof a hospital (Davey & Forrester-King, 2008). The nor-mal discharge time after birth is usually measured in hours(4 to 24 hours), not days. Birthing centers aim to provide a relaxing home envi- ronment and promote a \"culture of normalcy.\" Birth isconsidered a normal physiologic process, and most centersuse a non-interventional view of labor and birth. The rangeof services for the expectant family often includes pre- natal care, childbirth education, intrapartum care, andpostpartum care, including home follow-up and familyplanning (Fig. 2.2). One of the hallmarks of the free-standing birthing center is that it can provide truly family-centered care by approaching pregnancy and birth as anormal family event and encouraging all family mem-bers to participate. Education is often provided by suchcenters, encouraging families to become informed andself-reliant in the care of themselves and their families(Bainbridge, 2006). Birthing centers provide an alternative for women who are uncomfortable with a home birth but who do notwant to give birth in a hospital. Advantages of birthingcenters include a non-interventional approach to obstetriccare, freedom to eat and move around during labor, abilityto give birth in any position, and the right to have any CHAPTER 2 FAMILY-CENTERED COMMUNITY -BASEDCARE 35 FIGURE2.2Birthing centers aim to provide a re- laxing homelike environment and promote a cul-ture of normality while offering a full range ofhealth care services to the expectant family.(Photos by Gus Freedman.)11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 3536 INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING number of family and friends attend the birth. Disadvan- tages are that some centers have rigid screening criteria,which may eliminate healthy mothers from using birthcenters; many have rigid rules concerning transporting the mother to the hospital (e.g., prolonged labor, ruptured membranes); and many have no pediatrician on staff if thenewborn has special needs after birth (Lyndon, 2008). Home Birth For centuries women have been giving birth to babies in their home. Many feel more comfortable and relaxedwhen giving birth in their own environment. Women whowant no medical interventions and a very family-centeredbirth often choose to have a home birth. Home births arerecommended for pregnant women who are consideredto be at low risk for complications during labor and birth.Home birth is advantageous because it: Is the least expensive Allows the woman to experience labor and birth in the privacy, comfort, and familiarity of home whilesurrounded by loved ones Permits the woman to maintain control over every aspect affecting her labor (e.g., positions, attire, support people) Minimizes interference and unnecessary interventions, allowing labor to progress normally Provides continuous one-on-one care by the midwife throughout the childbirth process Promotes the development of a trusting relationship with the nurse midwife (American Pregnancy Associa-tion [APA], 2007) A home birth does have some disadvantages, includ- ing the limited availability of pain medication and dangerto the mother and baby if an emergency arises (e.g., pla-cental abruption, uterine rupture, cord prolapse, or a dis-tressed fetus). Delay in getting to the hospital couldjeopardize the life of the child or the mother. A backupplan for a health care provider and nearby hospital onstandby must be established should an emergency occur(Ramsey, 2007). Postpartum and Newborn Care Recent reforms in health care nancing have reduced hospital stays signicantly for new mothers. As a result,community-based nurses play a major role in extendingcare beyond the hospital setting. When new mothers aredischarged from the hospital, most are still experiencingperineal discomfort and uterine cramping. They maystill have pain from an episiotomy. They are fatiguedand may be constipated. They may feel uncertain aboutfeeding and caring for their newborn. These new moth-ers need to be made aware of community resources suchas telephone consultation by nurses, outpatient clinics, and home visits.Telephone Consultation Many hospitals offer telephone consultation services bytheir maternity nurses. The discharged mother is giventhe phone number of the nursing unit on the day of dis-charge and is instructed to call if she has any questions orconcerns. Because the nurses on the unit are familiar withher birth history and the newborn, they are in a good po-sition to assist her in adjusting to her new role. Althoughthis service is usually free, not all families recognize aproblem early or use this valuable informational resource. Outpatient Clinics Outpatient clinics offer another community-based sitewhere the childbearing family can obtain services. Usuallythe mother has received prenatal care before giving birthand thus has established some rapport with the nursingstaff there. The clinic staff is usually willing to answer anyquestions she may have about her health or that of hernewborn. Appointments usually include an examinationof the mother and newborn and instructions about umbil-ical cord care, postpartum and infant care, and nutritionfor both mother and infant. Postpartum Home Visits Home visits offer services similar to those offered at a scheduled clinic visit, but they also give the nurse an op-portunity to assess the family's adaptation and dynamicsand the home environment. During the past decade, hos-pital stays have averaged 24 to 48 hours or less for vaginalbirths and 72 to 96 hours for cesarean births (Centers forDisease Control [CDC], 2007a). Federal legislation wentinto effect in 1998 that prohibited insurers from restrict-ing hospital stays for mothers and newborns to less than 2 days for vaginal births or 4 days for cesarean births(CDC, 2007a). These shortened stays have reduced thetime available for educating mothers about caring forthemselves and their newborns. Postpartum care in the home environment usually includes: Monitoring the physical and emotional well-being of the family members (Fig. 2.3) Identifying potential or developing complications for the mother and newborn Bridging the gap between discharge and ambulatory follow-up for mothers and their newborns (Goulet,D'Amour, & Pineault 2007). High-Risk Newborn Home Care With the reduced lengths of stay, high-risk newborns are also being cared for in community settings. High-tech careonce was provided only in the hospital. Now, however,the increasing cost of complex care and the influences ofmanaged care have brought high-tech care into the home.Families have become \"health care systems\" by providingphysical, emotional, social, and developmental home 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 36CHAPTER 2 FAMILY-CENTERED COMMUNITY -BASEDCARE 37 for their technology-dependent infants. Suitable candidates for home care may include preterm infants who continueto need oxygen, low-birthweight infants needing nutritionalor hypercaloric formulas or adjunct feeding methods (e.g.,tube feedings), or infants with hydrocephalus or cerebralpalsy. A wide range of equipment may be used, includingmechanical ventilation, electronic apnea monitors, homeoxygen equipment, intravenous infusions, respiratory neb-ulizers, phototherapy, and suction equipment. All family members must work together to provide 24-hour care. The parents must negotiate with insurersfor reimbursement for durable medical equipment, mustbe able to troubleshoot equipment problems, and mustbe able to manage inventories of supplies and equipment.In addition, they must be able to assess the infant forproblems, determine the problem, decide when to callthe nurse, pharmacist, or physical therapist, and interpretand implement prescriptions. Technology in the homerequires nurses to focus on the family \"home care sys-tem\" to provide total care to the infant. Nurses can play a key role in assisting families by preparing them for and increasing their condence in car-ing for their infants at home. This adaptation begins beforedischarge from the hospital. Family members are activeparticipants in the transition-to-home plan. Recognition ofparental needs and addressing each area in the dischargeplan will ease the transition to home. Assessment of the family's preparedness is essential. The following questions can provide valuable informa-tion in this area: How well prepared are you to take care of your infant's physical, emotional, and equipment needs? How well prepared are you to obtain the home services you need for your infant? How well prepared are you to manage the stress of home care? These questions convey the nurse's concern for the infant and family while obtaining a thorough assessmentof the family's learning needs. Once preparedness has been assessed, the nurse can intervene as necessary. For example, if the caretakers donot think they are prepared to maintain machinery, tech-nology, medication, or developmental therapy, then thenurse can demonstrate the care to the family. The nurseprovides instructions and hands-on experience in a sup-portive environment until the family's condence in-creases. The nurse can also assist the family to anticipatethe common problems that might occur (e.g., advisingthem to avoid running out of supplies, to have enoughmedication or special formula mixture to last throughoutthe weekend, and to keep backup batteries for poweringmachines or portable oxygen). The outcome of the pre-paredness assessment and intervention is that the safetyof the infant is established and maintained. Nursing for families who are using complex home care equipment requires caring for the infant and family mem-bers' physical and emotional well-being as well as provid-ing solutions to problems they may encounter. Homehealth nurses need to identify, mobilize, and adapt a myr-iad of community resources to support the family in givingthe best possible care in the home setting. Preparing fam-ilies before hospital discharge, with home health nursescontinuing and reinforcing that focus, will ease the burdenof managing high-tech equipment in the home. Women's Health Care A woman's reproductive years span half her lifetime, on average. This is not a static period, but rather one that en-compasses several signicant stages. As her reproductivegoals change, so do a woman's health care needs. Becauseof these changing needs, comprehensive community-centered care is critical. Community-based women's health services have re- ceived increased emphasis during the past few decadessimply because of economics. Women use more healthcare services than men, they make as many as 90% ofhealth care decisions, and they represent the majority ofthe population (CDC, 2007b). Women spend 66 centsof every health care dollar, and 7 of the 10 most frequentlyperformed surgeries in the United States are specic towomen (Alexander et al., 2007). Examples of community-based women's health care services that can be freestand-ing or hospital-based include: Screening centers that offer mammograms, Pap smears, bone density assessments, genetic counseling, FIGURE2.3The nurse makes a postpartum home visit to assess the woman and her newborn.

Client- and family-centered communication increases satisfaction with nursing care and aids in im-proving knowledge and health care skills (Clark, 2008). Verbal and Nonverbal Communication Nurses use verbal communication continuously through-out the day when interacting with their clients. Goodverbal communication skills are necessary for excellentnursing assessment and teaching. Nonverbal communica-tion, also referred to as body language, includes attendingto others and active listening. When clients and familiesfeel they are being heard, trust and rapport are established.ultrasound, breast examinations, complete health risk appraisals, laboratory studies (complete blood count,cholesterol testing, thyroid testing, glucose testing fordiabetes, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels),and electrocardiograms Educational centers that provide health lec- tures, instruction on breast self-examinations and Papsmears, and computers for research Counseling centers that offer various support groups: genetics, psychotherapy, substance abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence Wellness centers that offer stress reduction techniques, massage therapy, guided imagery, hypnosis, smokingcessation, weight reduction, tai chi, yoga, andwomen's tness/exercise classes Alternative/wholeness healing centers that provide acupuncture, aromatherapy, biofeedback, therapeutictouch, facials, reflexology, and herbal remedies Retail centers that offer specialty equipment for rental and purchase, such as breast prostheses Women have multiple choices regarding services, set- tings, and health care providers. In the past most womenreceived health care services from physicians such as ob-stetricians, gynecologists, and family physicians, but todaynurse midwives and nurse practitioners are becomingmore prevalent in providing well-women care. Nurses who work in community-based settings need to be familiar with the many health issues commonly en-countered by women within their communities. All nurseswho work with women of any age in community-basedsettings, including the workplace, schools, practitioners'ofces, and clinics, should possess a thorough under-standing of the scope of women's health care and shouldbe prepared to intervene appropriately to prevent prob-lems and to promote health. Roles and Functions of the Community-Based Nurse Many nurses nd the shift from acute care to community settings a challenge. With the shift in responsibilities fromhospital care to community care, changes in nursing carehave resulted. Nurses working in community-based set-tings share many of the same roles and responsibilities astheir colleagues in acute care settings, but there are somedifferences. For example, in the community or home caresetting the nurse will provide direct client care but willspend more time in the role of educator, communicator,and manager than the nurse in the acute care setting. Inhome care the nurse will spend a signicant amount oftime in the supervisory or management role. Communicator Effective therapeutic communication with women, chil-dren, and families is critical to the provision of qualityRecall Maria, who recently was discharged from the hospital with her newborn son. How did the nurse communicate withMaria? Did the nurse's actions during the visit promote thedevelopment of trust between Maria and the nurse? Whatmight have been done differently to foster trust? People of all ages desire to be listened to without interruption (Brunner, 2008).Take NOTE! Active listening is critical to the communication process. Listening may uncover fears or concerns that thenurse may not have discovered through questioning. Bynot listening, critical information may be missed. Theclient or family may sense that the nurse is not listeningand thus may be reluctant to share further information.During the interaction, determine whether the client'sverbal communication is congruent with his or her non-verbal communication. Communication With Families When communicating with families, be honest. Familiesdesire to be valued and should be equal partners in thehealth care team. Allow family members to verbalize con-cerns and questions. Explain the use of equipment andthe correct sequence of procedures. Help the membersunderstand the long-term as well as short-term effects ofthe health treatment. Working With an Interpreter Attempting to communicate with a family who does notspeak English can be a highly frustrating situation forhealth care providers. Interpreters are an invaluable aidand an essential component of client and family educa-tion. Working with an interpreter, whether in person orover the phone, requires coordination of efforts so thatboth the family and the interpreter understand the infor-mation to be communicated. Working as a team, thenurse questions or informs and the interpreter conveys11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 38CHAPTER 2 FAMILY-CENTERED COMMUNITY -BASEDCARE 39 the information completely and accurately. Box 2.5 pres- ents tips for working with an interpreter to maximizeteaching efforts. Healthy People 2010 also addresses the topic of lan- guage differences (see Healthy People 2010). In addition,many health care facilities subscribe to Language Line(http://www.languageline.com/), which offers telephoneaccess to interpretation of 150 languages. Numerousother interpreters, translators, and language resources areavailable online. Communicating With Deaf or Hearing-Impaired Clients and Families For hearing-impaired clients, determine the method of communication they use: lip reading, American SignLanguage (ASL), another method, or some combina-tion. If the nurse is not proficient in ASL and the clientor family uses it, then an ASL interpreter must be avail-able if another adult family member is not present fortranslation. According to federal law, deaf clients anddeaf family members must be given the ability to com-municate effectively with health care providers (Chong-Hee Lieu et al., 2007). Direct Care Provider The community-based nurse typically performs less directphysical care than the nurse in the acute care setting.Many times the nurse may observe the client or caregiverperforming physical care tasks. Excellent assessment skillsare especially important in the community care setting.The nurse often is functioning in a more autonomousrole, and after data collection, the community-basednurse will often decide whether to initiate, continue, alter,or end physical nursing care. Assessment extends beyondphysical assessment of the client to include the environ-ment and the community. The nurse provides direct care to the perinatal client, beginning with the woman's rst visit to the health careprovider and extending through the pregnancy and birth.BOX 2.5 Tips for Working With Interpreters Help the interpreter prepare and understand what needs to be done ahead of time. A few min- utes of preparation may save a lot of time and helpcommunication flow more smoothly in the long run. Remember, the interpreter is the \"communica- tion bridge\" and not the \"content expert.\" The nurse's presence at teaching sessions is vital. Be patient. The interpreter's timing may not match that of others involved. It often takes longer to say in some languages what has already been said in English;therefore, plan for more time than you normally would. Speak slowly and clearly. Avoid jargon. Use short sentences and be concise. Avoid interrupting the interpreter. Pause every few sentences so the interpreter can translate your information. After 30 seconds of speaking, stop and let the interpreter express the infor-mation. Talk directly to the family, not the interpreter. Give the family and the interpreter a break. Ses- sions that last longer than 20 or 30 minutes are toomuch for anyone's attention span and concentration. Express the information in two or three different ways if needed. There may be cultural barriers as well as language and dialect differences that interferewith understanding. Interpreters may often know thecorrect communication protocols for the family. Use an interpreter to help ensure the family can read and understand translated written materi-als.The interpreter can also help answer questions and evaluate learning. Avoid side conversations during sessions. These can be uncomfortable for the family and jeopardizeclient-provider relationships and trust. Remember, just because someone speaks another language doesn't mean that he or she will make agood interpreter. An interpreter who has no medical background may not understand or interpret correctly,no matter how good his or her language skills are. Do not use children as interpreters. Doing so can affect family relationships, proper understanding, andcompliance with health care issues. Adapted from Weech, W. A. (1999). Tips for using interpreters. Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State.Recall Maria, the woman with the newborn who is receiving home care. On the second visit to Maria's home,the nurse brought a Spanish-speaking interpreter whoexplained the reason for the \"back to sleep\" position anddemonstrated to Maria several other useful positions forfeeding and holding. Maria was smiling when the nurse left and asking when she would be back. What made thedifference in their relationship during the second visit? What interventions demonstrate culturally competent care?Increase the proportion of local health departments thathave established culturally appropriate and linguisticallycompetent community healthpromotion and disease preven-tion programs.Work with professionals and individuals from variouscultures to develop materialsand programs for health pro-motion that are culturallycompetent. Ensure teaching materials are provided in the appropri-ate language.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Objective Signicance11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 39In addition, the nurse provides direct care involving the following areas: Contraception Abortion Infertility Screening for sexually transmitted infections Preconceptual risk assessment and care Educator Due to shortened hospital stays and decreased admissions, providing client and family education is a key role fornurses in the community. Many times teaching begins in the community setting, especially the home. In thecommunity-based setting, client teaching is often focusedon assisting the client and family to achieve independence. Regardless of the type of setting, nurses are in a unique position to help clients and families manage their ownhealth care. Clients and families need to be knowledgeableabout areas such as their condition, the health care man-agement plan, and when and how to contact health careproviders. With the limited time available in all health carearenas, nurses must focus on teaching goals and beginteaching at the earliest opportunity (Clark, 2008).40 UNIT ONE INTRODUCTION TO MATERNITY , NEWBORN , ANDWOMEN'SNURSING Steps of Client and Family Education The steps of client and family education are similar to the steps of the nursing process: the nurse must assess, plan,implement, evaluate, and nally document education.Once the nurse achieves a level of comfort and experiencewith each of these steps, they all blend together into oneharmonious whole that becomes an everyday part ofnursing practice. Client education begins with the firstclient encounter and proceeds through discharge and beyond. Reassessment after each step or change in theprocess is critical to ensuring success. Intervening to Enhance Learning Nurses are in an excellent position to foster an environ-ment that is conducive to learning. For example, it is en-tirely appropriate to say to the client, \"Many people havea problem reading and remembering the information onthis paper (booklet, manual). Is this ever a problem foryou?\" Once a problem is acknowledged, the nurse is freeto adjust verbal communication techniques and writtenmaterials to assist with learning and to communicate thisneed to the entire interdisciplinary health care team. Nurses implement individualized teaching techniques based on the assessment information and identied goals.In general, the following techniques can facilitate learning: Slow down and repeat information often. Speak in conversational style using plain, nonmedical language. \"Chunk\" information and teach it in small bits using logical steps. Prioritize information and teach \"survival skills\" rst. Use visuals, such as pictures, videos, and models. Teach using an interactive, \"hands-on\" approach. If the client or family has poor health literacy skills, learning can be fostered by the use of pictures or illustra-tions, videos or audio tapes, or color coding (such asmedication bottles or steps of a procedure). In addition,teaching can include a \"back-up\" family member.Increase the proportion of per- sons appropriately counseledabout health behaviors. (De-velopmental) Increase the proportion of health care organizations that provideclient and family education;increase the proportion ofclients who report that theyare satised with the clienteducation they receive fromtheir health care organization.Assess health learning needs of women, children, andtheir families. Plan health care education in collaboration with clientsand their families. Provide health education at each client encounter. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Objective Signicance Client education occurs when nurses share informa- tion, knowledge, and skills with clients and families, thusempowering them to take responsibility for their healthcare. Through client education, clients and families canovercome feelings of powerlessness and helplessness andgain the condence and capability to be active membersin their plan of care. Overall, client and family education allows clients and families to make informed decisions, ensures the presenceof basic health care skills, promotes recognition of prob-lem situations, promotes appropriate responses to prob-lems, and allows for questions to be answered (Clark,2008). Client and family education is a priority and is ad-dressed in Healthy People 2010. There is no prescription more valuable than knowledge. (C. Everett Koop, MD, Former Surgeon General ofthe United States)Take NOTE! To cope effectively with illness, to under- stand and participate in decisions about treat- ment plans, and to maintain and improve health after treatment, clients and their families must have knowledgeand skills relevant to their conditions (JCAHO, 2008).Take NOTE! 11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 40Documenting Teaching and Learning Documenting client care and education is part of everynurse's professional practice and serves four main pur-poses. First and foremost, the client's medical recordserves as a communication tool that the entire interdisci-plinary team can use to keep track of what the client andfamily has learned already and what learning still needsto occur. Next, it serves to testify to the education thefamily has received if legal matters arise. Thirdly, it veri-es standards set by the JCAHO, Centers for Medicareand Medicaid Services (CMS), and other accreditingbodies that hold health care providers accountable forclient education activities. And lastly, it informs third-party payers of the goods and services that were providedfor reimbursement purposes. Documentation of client and family education is im- perative. It is the only means available to ensure that theeducational plan and objectives have been completed. Discharge Planner and Case Manager Due to the short length of stays in acute settings andthe shift to community settings for clients with complex health needs, discharge planning and case managementhave become an important nursing role in the community.Discharge planning involves the development and imple-mentation of a comprehensive plan for the safe dischargeof a client from a health care facility and for continuingsafe and effective care in the community and at home.Case management focuses on coordinating health careservices while balancing quality and cost outcomes. Oftenclients requiring community-based care, especially homecare, have complex medical needs that require an inter-disciplinary team to meet their physical, psychosocial,medical, nursing, developmental, and education needs.The nurse plays an important role in initiating and main-taining the link between team members and the client toensure that the client and family are receiving comprehen-sive, coordinated care. Advocate and Resource Manager Client advocate is another important role of the community-based nurse to ensure that the client's and family's needsare being met. Advocacy also helps ensure that the clientand family have available resources and appropriatehealth care services. For example, the pregnant woman onbed rest at home may need help in caring for her otherchildren, maintaining the household, or getting to her ap-pointments. Women with complex medical needs may re-quire nancial assistance through Medicaid or Medicaidwaivers (state-run programs that use federal and statemoney to pay for the health care of individuals with cer-tain medical conditions). They may also need assistancein obtaining needed equipment, additional services, andtransportation. Community-based nurses need a basicunderstanding of community, state, and federal resourcesCHAPTER 2 FAMILY-CENTERED COMMUNITY -BASEDCARE 41 to ensure that clients and their families have access to those necessary for them. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Family-centered care recognizes the concept of the fam- ily as the constant. The health and functional abilities ofthe family affect the health of the client and other mem-bers of the family. Family-centered care recognizes andrespects family strengths and individuality, encouragesreferrals for family support, and facilitates collaboration.It ensures flexible, accessible, and responsive health caredelivery while incorporating developmental needs andimplementing policies to provide emotional and nan-cial support to women and their families. /H18546Health care delivery has moved from acute care settings out into the community, with an emphasis on healthpromotion and illness prevention. Community healthnursing focuses on preventing health problems andimproving the health of populations and communities,addressing current and potential health needs of thepopulation or community, and promoting and preserv-ing the health of a population regardless of age or diag-nosis. Community health nurses perform epidemiologicinvestigations to help analyze and develop health policyand community health initiatives. /H18546Community-based nurses focus on providing personal care to individuals and families in the community.They focus on promoting and preserving health as wellas preventing disease or injury. They help women andtheir families cope with illness and disease. Community-based nurses are direct care providers as well as advo-cators and educators. They focus on minimizing barri-ers to allow the patient to develop to his or her fullpotential. /H18546Community-based nursing uses the nursing process in caring for clients in community settings and involvesprimary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels.Nursing interventions in community-based settingsinclude health screening, education, medication ad-ministration, telephone consultation, health systemreferral, instruction, nutritional counseling, and riskidentication. /H18546Nurses working in the community need to develop cul- tural competence. Steps to gaining cultural competenceinclude cultural self-awareness, cultural knowledge, cul-tural skills, and cultural encounters. /H18546Settings for community-based nursing including physi- cians' ofces, clinics, health departments, urgent carecenters, clients' homes, churches, and shelters (e.g., do-mestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, and disastershelters). Nurses provide wellness care, episodic ill care,and chronic care to women and their families. /H18546There has been an increase in home health care due to shorter hospital stays and cost containment along withan increase in income and longevity of individuals with11223-02_CH02.qxd 8/4/08 2:36 PM Page 41chronic and debilitating health conditions. Technology also has improved, which allows clients to be monitoredand to undergo complicated procedures at home. /H18546Roles and functions of the community-based nurse in- clude communicator, direct care provider, educator,discharge planner and case manager, and advocate andresource manager. /H18546Open, honest communication is essential for community- based nurses. The use of an interpreter may be neces-sary to ensure effective communication. Maintainingcondentiality and providing privacy are key. /H18546A family's knowledge related to the client's health or illness is vital. Nurses working in the community playa major role in educating women and their families. /H18546Discharge planning provides a comprehensive plan for the safe discharge of a client from a health care facilityand for continuing safe and effective care in the com-munity. Case management focuses on coordinatinghealth care services while balancing quality and cost.Both contribute to improved transition from the hos-pital to the community for women, their families, andthe health care team. /H18546Community-based nurses act as advocates and resource managers to help ensure that the client and family havethe necessary resources and appropriate health careservices available to them.

The female reproductivesystem produces the female reproductive cells (the eggs,or ova) and contains an organ (uterus) in which develop-ment of the fetus takes place; the male reproductive systemproduces the male reproductive cells (the sperm) and con-tains an organ (penis) that deposits the sperm within thefemale. Nurses need to have a thorough understanding ofthe anatomy and physiology of the male and female repro-ductive systems to be able to assess the health of thesesystems, to promote reproductive system health, to carefor conditions that might affect the reproductive organs,and to provide client teaching concerning the reproduc-tive system. This chapter will review the female and malereproductive systems and the menstrual cycle as it relatesto reproduction. Female Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology The female reproductive system is composed of both external and internal reproductive organs. External Female Reproductive Organs The external female reproductive organs collectively are called the vulva (which means \"covering\" in Latin). The vulva serves to protect the urethral and vaginal openingsand is highly sensitive to touch to increase the female'spleasure during sexual arousal (Coad & Dunstall, 2005).The structures that up the the labia majora and minora, the (Fig. 3.1). Mons Pubis The mons pubis is over the symphysis pubis. This fatty tissue and skin48 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN is covered with pubic hair after puberty. It protects the symphysis pubis during sexual intercourse. Labia The labia majora (large lips), which are relatively large andfleshy, are comparable to the scrotum in males. The labiamajora contain sweat and sebaceous (oil-secreting) glands;after puberty, they are covered with hair. Their functionis to protect the vaginal opening. The labia minora (smalllips) are the delicate hairless inner folds of skin; they canbe very small or up to 2 inches wide. They lie just insidethe labia majora and surround the openings to the vaginaand urethra. The labia minora grow down from the ante-rior inner part of the labia majora on each side. They arehighly vascular and abundant in nerve supply. They lubri-cate the vulva, swell in response to stimulation, and arehighly sensitive. Clitoris and Prepuce The clitoris is a small, cylindrical mass of erectile tissue andnerves. It is located at the anterior junction of the labiaminora. There are folds above and below the clitoris. Thejoining of the folds above the clitoris forms the prepuce,a hood-like covering over the The external female reproductive organs. ( B) Normal appearance of external structures. (Photo by B. Proud.) The hood-like covering over the clitoris is the site for female circumcision, which is still practiced in some countries by some cultures.Take NOTE! A rich supply of blood vessels gives the clitoris a pink color. Like the penis, the clitoris is very sensitive to touch,stimulation, and temperature and can become erect. Forits small size, it has a generous blood and nerve supply.11223-03_UT2-CH03.qxd 8/4/08 2:39 PM Page 48There are more free nerve endings of sensory reception located on the clitoris than on any other part of the body,and it is, unsurprisingly, the most erotically sensitive partof the genitalia for most females. Its function is sexualstimulation (Katz, 2007).CHAPTER 3 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 49 episiotomy has decreased over the past 25 years. The procedure should be applied selectively rather than rou-tinely. An episiotomy can add to postpartum discomfortand perineal trauma and can lead to fecal incontinence(Cunningham et al., 2005). Internal Female Reproductive Organs The internal female reproductive organs consist of the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Thesestructures develop and function according to the spe-cific hormone influences that affect fertility and child-bearing (Fig. 3.2). Vagina The vagina is a highly distensible musculomembranous canal situated in front of the rectum and behind the blad-der. It is a tubular, bromuscular organ lined with mucousmembrane that lies in a series of transverse folds calledrugae. The rugae allow for extreme dilatation of the canalduring labor and birth. The vagina is a canal that connectsthe external genitals to the uterus. It receives the penis andthe sperm ejaculated during sexual intercourse, and itserves as an exit passageway for menstrual blood andfor the fetus during childbirth. The front and back wallsnormally touch each other so that there is no space inthe vagina except when it is opened (e.g., during a pelvicexamination or intercourse). In the adult, the vaginalcavity is 3 to 4 inches long. Muscles that control its diam-eter surround the lower third of the vagina. The uppertwo thirds of the vagina lies above these muscles and canbe stretched easily. During a woman's reproductive years,the mucosal lining of the vagina has a corrugated appear-ance and is resistant to bacterial colonization. Beforepuberty and after menopause (if the woman is not taking estrogen), the mucosa is smooth due to lower levels ofestrogen (Dorland, 2007). The vagina has an acidic environment, which protects it against ascending infections. Antibiotic therapy, douch-ing, perineal hygiene sprays, and deodorants upset the acidbalance within the vaginal environment and can predisposewomen to infections. Uterus The uterus is a pear-shaped muscular organ at the top of the vagina. It lies behind the bladder and in front ofthe rectum and is anchored in position by eight ligaments,although it is not rmly attached or adherent to any partof the skeleton. A full bladder tilts the uterus backward;a distended rectum tilts it forward. The uterus alters itsposition by gravity or with change of posture, and is thesize and shape of an inverted pear. It is the site of men-struation, implantation of a fertilized ovum, developmentof the fetus during pregnancy, and labor. Before therst pregnancy, it measures approximately 3 inches long,2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. After a pregnancy, theuterus remains larger than before the pregnancy. Aftermenopause, it becomes smaller and atrophies. The word \"clitoris\" is from the Greek word for key; in ancient times the clitoris was thought to be the key to a woman's sexuality.Take NOTE! Heavy physical exertion, use of tampons, or injury to the area can alter the appear- ance of the hymen in girls and women who have notbeen sexually active.Take NOTE! Vestibule The vestibule is an oval area enclosed by the labia minora laterally. It is inside the labia minora and outside of thehymen and is perforated by six openings. Opening intothe vestibule are the urethra from the urinary bladder, thevagina, and two sets of glands. The opening to the vaginais called the introitus, and the half-moon-shaped areabehind the opening is called the fourchette. Through tiny ducts beside the introitus, Bartholin's glands, when stim-ulated, secrete mucus that supplies lubrication for inter-course. Skene's glands are located on either side of theopening to the urethra. They secrete a small amount of mucus to keep the opening moist and lubricated for thepassage of urine (Schuiling & Likis, 2006). The vaginal opening is surrounded by the hymen (maidenhead). The hymen is a tough, elastic, perforated,mucosa-covered tissue across the vaginal introitus. In avirgin, the hymen may completely cover the opening, butit usually encircles the opening like a tight ring. Becausethe degree of tightness varies among women, the hymenmay tear at the rst attempt at intercourse, or it may be sosoft and pliable that no tearing occurs. In a woman whois not a virgin, the hymen usually appears as small tags oftissue surrounding the vaginal opening, but the presenceor absence of the hymen can neither conrm nor rule outsexual experience (Mattson & Smith, 2004). Perineum The perineum is the most posterior part of the externalfemale reproductive organs. This external region is locatedbetween the vulva and the anus. It is made up of skin, mus-cle, and fascia. The perineum can become lacerated orincised during childbirth and may need to be repairedwith sutures. Incising the perineum area to provide morespace for the presenting part is called an episiotomy.Although still a common obstetric procedure, the use of11223-03_UT2-CH03.qxd 8/4/08 2:39 PM Page 49The uterine wall is relatively thick and composed of three layers: the endometrium (innermost layer), the my-ometrium (muscular middle layer), and the perimetrium(outer serosal layer that covers the body of the uterus). Theendometrium is the mucosal layer that lines the uterine cavity in nonpregnant women. It varies in thickness from0.5 mm to 5 mm and has an abundant supply of glandsand blood vessels (Cunningham et al., 2005). The my-ometrium makes up the major portion of the uterus and iscomposed of smooth muscle linked by connective tissuewith numerous elastic bers. During pregnancy, the uppermyometrium undergoes marked hypertrophy, but there islimited change in the cervical muscle content. Anatomic subdivisions of the uterus include the con- vex portion above the uterine tubes (the fundus); the50 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN central portion (the corpus or body) between the fundus and the cervix; and the cervix, or neck, which opens intothe vagina. Cervix The cervix , the lower part of the uterus, opens into the vagina and has a channel that allows sperm to enter theuterus and menstrual discharge to exit. It is composed ofbrous connective tissue. During a pelvic examination,the part of the cervix that protrudes into the upper endof the vagina can be visualized. Like the vagina, this partof the cervix is covered by mucosa, which is smooth,rm, and doughnut-shaped, with a visible central open-ing called the external os (Fig. 3.3). Before childbirth,the external cervical os is a small, regular, oval opening. Fundus of uterus Fallopian tube Abdominal opening of fallopian the female reproductive organs. ( A) Lateral view. ( B) Anterior view. (Source: Anatomical Chart Company[2001]. Atlas of 8/4/08 2:39 PM Page 50After childbirth, the opening is converted into a transverse slit that resembles lips (Fig. 3.4). Except during menstru-ation or ovulation, the cervix is usually a good barrieragainst bacteria. The cervix has an alkaline environment,which protects the sperm from the acidic environment inthe vagina. The canal or channel of the cervix is lined with mucus- secreting glands. This mucus is thick and impenetrable tosperm until just before the ovaries release an egg ( ovula- tion). At ovulation, the consistency of the mucus changes so that sperm can swim through it, allowing fertilization. Atthe same time, the mucus-secreting glands of the cervixactually become able to store live sperm for 2 or 3 days.These sperm can later move up through the corpus andinto the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg; thus, intercourse1 or 2 days before ovulation can lead to pregnancy. Becausesome women do not ovulate consistently, pregnancy canoccur at varying times after the last menstrual period. Thechannel in the cervix is too narrow for the fetus to passthrough during pregnancy, but during labor it stretches tolet the newborn through. Corpus The corpus, or the main body of the uterus, is a highlymuscular organ that enlarges to hold the fetus during preg-nancy. The inner lining of the corpus (endometrium) un-dergoes cyclic changes as a result of the changing levels of hormones secreted by the ovaries: it is thickest duringthe part of the menstrual cycle in which a fertilized eggwould be expected to enter the uterus and is thinnest just after menstruation. If fertilization does not take placeCHAPTER 3 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 51 during this cycle, most of the endometrium is shed and bleeding occurs, resulting in the monthly period. If fertil-ization does take place, the embryo attaches to the wall of the uterus, where it becomes embedded in the en-dometrium (about 1 week after fertilization); this processis called implantation (Heffner & Schust, 2006). Men-struation then ceases during the 40 weeks (280 days) of pregnancy. During labor, the muscular walls of the cor- pus contract to push the baby through the cervix and intothe vagina. Fallopian Tubes The fallopian tubes are hollow, cylindrical structures that extend 2 to 3 inches from the upper edges of theuterus toward the ovaries. Each tube is about 7 to 10 cmlong (4 inches) and approximately 0.7 cm in diameter.The end of each tube flares into a funnel shape, providinga large opening for the egg to fall into when it is releasedfrom the ovary. Cilia (beating, hair-like extensions on cells)line the tube and the muscles in the tube's wall.The fallopian tubes convey the ovum from the ovary to theuterus and sperm from the uterus toward the ovary. Thismovement is accomplished via ciliary action and peristal-sis. If sperm is present in the fallopian tube as a result ofsexual intercourse or articial insemination, fertilizationof the ovum can occur in the distal portion of the tube. Ifthe egg is fertilized, it will divide over a period of 4 dayswhile it moves slowly down the fallopian tube and intothe uterus. Ovaries The ovaries are a set of paired glands resembling unshelled almonds set in the pelvic cavity below and to either sideof the umbilicus. They are usually pearl-colored andoblong. They are homologous to the testes. Each ovaryweighs from 2 to 5 grams and is about 4 cm long, 2 cmwide, and 1 cm thick (Speroff & Fritz, 2005). The ovariesare not attached to the fallopian tubes but are suspendednearby from several ligaments, which help hold them inposition. The development and the release of the ovum andthe secretion of the hormones estrogen and progesteroneare the two primary functions of the ovary. The ovaries link AB FIGURE3.3 Appearance of normal cervix. Note: This is the cervix of a multipara female. (Photo by B. Proud.)FIGURE3.4 (A) Nulliparous cervical os.

After an ovum matures, it passes into thefallopian tubes. Breasts The two mammary glands, or breasts , are accessory organs of the female reproductive system that are special-ized to secrete milk following pregnancy. They overlie thepectoralis major muscles and extend from the secondto the sixth ribs and from the sternum to the axilla. Eachbreast has a nipple located near the tip, which is surroundedby a circular area of pigmented skin called the areola. Eachbreast is composed of approximately 9 lobes (the numbercan range between 4 and 18), which contain glands (alve-olar) and a duct (lactiferous) that leads to the nipple andopens to the outside (Fig. 3.5). The lobes are separated bydense connective and adipose tissues, which also help sup-port the weight of the breasts (Ramsay, Kent, Hartmann& Hartmann, 2005). During pregnancy, placental estrogen terone stimulate the development of the mammary glands.Because of this hormonal activity, the breasts may dou-ble in size during pregnancy. At the same time, glandulartissue replaces the adipose tissue of the breasts. Following childbirth and the expulsion of the placenta, levels of placental hormones (progesterone and lactogen)fall rapidly, and the action of prolactin (milk-producinghormone) is no longer inhibited. Prolactin stimulates theproduction of milk within a few days after childbirth, but inthe interim, a dark yellow fluid called colostrum is secreted.Colostrum contains more minerals and protein, but lesssugar and fat, than mature breast milk. Colostrum secre-tion may continue for approximately a week after child-birth, with gradual conversion to mature milk. Colostrumis rich in maternal antibodies, especially immunoglobulinA (IgA), which offers protection for the newborn againstenteric pathogens.52 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Female Sexual Response With sexual stimulation, tissues in the clitoris and breasts and around the vaginal orice ll with blood and the erec-tile tissues swell. At the same time, the vagina begins toexpand and elongate to accommodate the penis. As partof the whole vasocongestive reaction, the labia majoraand minor swell and darken. As sexual stimulation inten-sies, the vestibular glands secrete mucus to moisten andlubricate the tissues to facilitate insertion of the penis. Hormones play an integral role in the female sexual response as well. Adequate estrogen and testosterone mustbe available for the brain to sense incoming arousal stim-uli. Research indicates that estrogen preserves the vascularfunction of female sex organs and affects genital sensa-tion. It also is believed to promote blood flow to theseareas during stimulation. Testosterone is thought tobe the hormone of sexual desire in women (McKinney,2007). The zenith of intense stimulation is orgasm, the spas- modic and involuntary contractions of the muscles inthe region of the vulva, the uterus, and the vagina thatproduce a pleasurable sensation to the woman. Typi-cally the woman feels warm and relaxed after an orgasm. Within a short time after orgasm, the two physiologic mechanisms that created the sexual response, vasocon-gestion and muscle contraction, rapidly dissipate. The Female Reproductive Cycle The female reproductive cycle is a complex process that encompasses an intricate series of chemical secretionsand re actions to produce the ultimate potential for fertility and birth. The female reproductive cycle is a general termencompassing the ovarian cycle, the endometrial cycle,the hormonal changes that regulate them, and the cycli-cal changes in the breasts. The endometrium, ovaries,pituitary gland, and hypothalamus are all involved inthe cyclic changes that help to prepare the body for fer-tilization. Absence of fertilization results in menstruation,the monthly shedding of the uterine lining. Menstruation Alveoli Ducts Areola Nipple Lymph nodes FIGURE3.5 Anatomy of the breasts. (Photo by B.

Menopause is the naturally occurring cessation of regu-lar menstrual cycles. Menstruation Menstruation is the normal, predictable physiologic process whereby the inner lining of the uterus (endo-metrium) is expelled by the body. Typically, this occursmonthly. Menstruation has many effects on girls andwomen, including emotional and self-image issues. In theUnited States, the average age at menarche (the start of menstruation in females) is 12.8 years, with a rangebetween 8 and 18. Genetics is the most important factor in determining the age at which menarche starts, but geo-graphic location, nutrition, weight, general health, nutri-tion, and psychological factors are also important (Shelby& Ruocco, 2007). Pubertal events preceding the firstmenses have progression: thelarche, the devel-opment of breast buds; adrenarche, the appearance ofpubic and then axillary hair, followed by a growth spurt;and menarche (occurring about 2 years after the start ofbreast development). In healthy pubertal girls, the men-strual period varies in flow heaviness and may remain irreg-ular in occurrence for up to 2 years following menarche.After that time, the regular menstrual cycle should beestablished. Most women will experience 300 to 400 men-strual cycles within their lifetime (Diaz, Laufer & Breech,2006). Normal, regular menstrual cycles vary in frequencyfrom 21 to 36 days (with the average cycle lasting 28 days),bleeding lasts 3 to 7 days, and blood loss averages 20 to80 mL (Schuiling & Likis, 2006). Irregular menses canbe associated with irregular ovulation, stress, disease, andhormonal imbalances (Cunningham et al., 2005). Think back to Linda, who was introduced at the beginning of the chapter. What questions might need to be asked toassess her condition? What laboratory work might beanticipated to validate her heavier flow? Although menstruation is a normal process, various world cultures have taken a wide variety of attitudes towardit, seeing it as everything from a sacred time to an uncleantime. In a society where menstruation is viewed negatively,nurses can help women develop a more positive image ofthis natural physiologic process.Reproductive Cycle The reproductive cycle, also referred to as the menstrual cycle, results from a functional hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and a precise sequencing of hormones that leadto ovulation. If conception doesn't occur, menses ensues.The ranges of normal menstrual cycles are as follows: Cycle length: 21 to 36 days Duration of flow: 3 to 7 days Amount of flow: 20 to 80 mL The female reproductive cycle involves two cycles that occur simultaneously: the ovarian cycle, during whichovulation occurs, and the endometrial cycle, during whichmenstruation occurs. Ovulation divides these two cyclesat midcycle. Ovulation occurs when the ovum is releasedfrom its follicle; after leaving the ovary, the ovum enters thefallopian tube and journeys toward the uterus. If spermfertilizes the ovum during its journey, pregnancy occurs.Figure 3.6 summarizes the menstrual cycle. Ovarian Cycle The ovarian cycle is the series of events associated with adeveloping oocyte (ovum or egg) within the ovaries. Whilemen manufacture sperm daily, often into advanced age,women are born with a single lifetime supply of ova thatare released from the ovaries gradually throughout thechildbearing years. In the female ovary, 2 million oocytesare present at birth, and about 400,000 follicles are stillpresent at puberty. The excess follicles are depleted duringthe childbearing years, with only 400 follicles ovulatedduring the reproductive period (Speroff & Fritz, 2005).The ovarian cycle begins when the follicular cells (ovumand surrounding cells) swell and the maturation processstarts. The maturing follicle at this stage is called a graaanfollicle. The ovary raises many follicles monthly, but usu-ally only one follicle matures to reach ovulation. The ovar-ian cycle consists of three phases: the follicular phase,ovulation, and the luteal phase. Follicular Phase This phase is so named because it is when the follicles inthe ovary grow and form a mature egg. This phase starts onday 1 of the menstrual cycle and continues until ovulation,approximately 10 to 14 days later. The follicular phase isnot consistent in duration because of the time variations infollicular development. These variations account for thedifferences in menstrual cycle lengths (Hackley, Kriebs &Rousseau, 2007). The hypothalamus is the initiator levels of estrogen secreted from the ma-turing follicular cells and the continued growth of the dom-inant follicle cell induce proliferation of the endometriumand myometrium. This thickening of the uterine lining sup-ports an implanted ovum if pregnancy occurs. Prompted by the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland re- leases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimu-lates the ovary to produce 5 to 20 immature follicles. Eachfollicle houses an immature oocyte or that11223-03_UT2-CH03.qxd 8/4/08 2:39 PM Page 53is targeted to mature fully will soon rupture and expel a mature oocyte in the process of ovulation. A surge inluteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitarygland is actually responsible for affecting the nal devel-opment and subsequent rupture of the mature follicle. Ovulation At ovulation, a mature follicle ruptures in response to asurge of LH, releasing a mature oocyte (ovum). This usu-ally occurs on day 14 in a 28-day cycle. When ovulationoccurs, there is a drop in estrogen. Typically ovulation takesplace approximately 10 to 12 hours after the LH peakand 24 to 36 hours after estrogen levels peak (Speroff& Fritz, 2005). The distal ends of the fallopian tubesbecome active near the time of ovulation and create cur-rents that help carry the ovum into the uterus. The life-span of the ovum is only about 24 hours; unless it meetsa sperm on its journey within that time, it will die. During ovulation, the cervix produces thin, clear, stretchy, slippery mucus that is designed to help the spermtravel up through the cervix to meet the ovum for fertil-54 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Luteal Phase The luteal phase begins at ovulation and lasts until themenstrual phase of the next cycle. It typically occursday 15 through day 28 of a 28-day cycle. After the folli-cle ruptures as it releases the egg, it closes and forms acorpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes increasingamounts of the hormone progesterone, which interactswith the endometrium to prepare it for implantation. Atthe beginning of the luteal phase, progesterone inducesization. The one constant, whether a women's cycle is 28 days or 120 days, is that ovulation takes place 14 daysbefore menstruation (Shelby & Ruocco, 2007).

Some women can feel a pain on one side of the abdomen around the time the egg is released. This midcycle pain is called mittelschmerz.Take NOTE! 11223-03_UT2-CH03.qxd 8/4/08 2:39 PM Page 54CHAPTER 3 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 55 the endometrial glands to secrete glycogen, mucus, and other substances. These glands become tortuous and havelarge lumens due to increased secretory activity. The pro-gesterone secreted by the corpus luteum causes the tem-perature of the body to rise slightly until the start of thenext period. A signicant increase in temperature, usually0.5 to 1 degrees Fahrenheit, is generally seen within aday or two after ovulation has occurred; the temperature remains elevated for 12 to 16 days, until menstruationbegins (Chandran, 2007). This rise in temperature can beplotted on a graph and gives an indication of when ovula-tion has occurred. In the absence of fertilization, the corpusluteum begins to degenerate and consequently ovarian hor-mone levels decrease. As estrogen and progesterone levelsdecrease, the endometrium undergoes involution. In a28-day cycle, menstruation then begins approximately14 days after ovulation in the absence of pregnancy. FSH and LH are generally at their lowest levels during the lutealphase and highest during the follicular phase. Consider THIS! We had been married 2 years when my husband and I decided to start a family. I began thinking back tomy high-school biology class and tried to rememberabout ovulation and what to look for. I also used theInternet to nd the answers I was seeking. As I wasreading, it all started to come into place. During ovu-lation, a woman's cervical mucus increases and sheexperiences a wet sensation for several days midcycle.The mucus also becomes stretchable during this time.In addition, body temperature rises slightly and thenfalls if no conception takes place. Armed with thisknowledge, I began to check my temperature daily before arising and began to monitor the consistency ofmy cervical mucus. I gured that monitoring these twosigns of ovulation could help me discover the best timeto conceive. After 6 months of trying without results, I wondered what I was doing wrong. Did I really understand my body's reproductive activity? What additional suggestions might the nurse offer this woman in her journey to conception? What communityresources might be available to assist this couple? Howdoes knowledge of the reproductive system help nursestake care of couples who are trying to become pregnant? Endometrial Cycle The endometrial cycle occurs in response to cyclic hor- monal changes. The four phases of the endometrial cycleare the proliferative phase, secretory phase, ischemicphase, and menstrual phase. Proliferative Phase The proliferative phase starts with enlargement of theendometrial glands in response to increasing amountsof estrogen. The blood vessels become dilated and theendometrium increases in thickness dramatically from 0.5to 5 mm in height and increases eight-fold in thicknessin preparation for implantation of the fertilized ovum(Heffner & Schust, 2006). Cervical mucus becomes thin,clear, stretchy, and more alkaline, making it more favorableto sperm to enhance the opportunity for fertilization. Theproliferative phase starts on about day 5 of the menstrualcycle and lasts to the time of ovulation. This phase de-pends on estrogen stimulation resulting from ovarian fol-licles, and this phase coincides with the follicular phaseof the ovarian cycle. Secretory Phase The secretory phase begins at ovulation to about 3 daysbefore the next menstrual period. Under the influence ofprogesterone released by the corpus luteum after ovula-tion, the endometrium becomes thickened and more vas-cular (growth of the spiral arteries) and glandular (secretingmore glycogen and lipids). These dramatic changes areall in preparation for implantation, if it were to occur.This phase typically lasts from day 15 (after ovulation) today 28 and coincides with the luteal phase of the ovariancycle. The secretory phase doesn't take place if ovulationhas not occurred. Ischemic Phase If fertilization does not occur, the ischemic phase begins.Estrogen and progesterone levels drop sharply duringthis phase as the corpus luteum starts to degenerate.Changes in the endometrium occur with spasm of the arte-rioles, resulting in ischemia of the basal layer. The ischemialeads to shedding of the endometrium down to the basallayer, and menstrual flow begins. Menstrual Phase The menstrual phase begins as the spiral arteries rupturesecondary to ischemia, releasing blood into the uterus,and the sloughing of the endometrial lining begins. Iffertilization does not take place, the corpus luteum de-generates. As a result, both estrogen and progesteronelevels fall and the thickened endometrial lining sloughsaway from the uterine wall and passes out via the vagina.The beginning of the menstrual flow marks the end of onemenstrual cycle and the start of a new one. Most womenreport bleeding for an average of 3 to 7 days. The amountof menstrual flow varies, but approximately 6 to 8 ouncesin volume per cycle is average (Alexander et al., 2007). Menstrual Cycle Hormones The menstrual cycle involves a complex interaction of hormones. The predominant hormones include gonadotropin-releasing hormone, FSH, LH, the hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner through-out the reproductive cycle. It pulsates slowly during thefollicular phase and increases during the luteal phase.GnRH induces the release of FSH and LH withovulation. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone is by the anterior pituitary gland and is primarily responsiblefor the maturation of the ovarian follicle. FSH secretionis highest and most important during the rst week of thefollicular phase of the reproductive cycle. Luteinizing Hormone Luteinizing hormone (LH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland and is required for both the nal maturationof preovulatory follicles and luteinization of the rupturedfollicle. As a estrogen production declines and pro-gesterone secretion continues. Thus, estrogen levels fall a day before ovulation, and progesterone levels begin to rise. Estrogen Estrogen is secreted by the ovaries and is crucial for the development and maturation of the follicle. Estrogen ispredominant at the end of the proliferative phase, di-rectly preceding ovulation. After ovulation, estrogen lev-els drop sharply as progesterone dominates. In theendometrial cycle, estrogen induces proliferation of theendometrial glands. Estrogen also causes the uterus to56 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN increase in size and weight because of increased glyco- gen, amino acids, electrolytes, and water. Blood supplyis expanded as well. Progesterone Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum. Pro- gesterone levels increase just before ovulation and peak5 to 7 days after ovulation. During the luteal phase, prog-esterone induces swelling and increased secretion of theendometrium. This hormone is often called the hormoneof pregnancy because of its calming effect (reduces uter-ine contractions) on the uterus, allowing pregnancy tobe maintained. Prostaglandins Prostaglandins are a closely related group of oxygenatedfatty acids that are produced by the endometrium, with avariety of effects throughout the body. Although they haveregulatory effects and are sometimes called hormones,prostaglandins are not technically hormones because theyare produced by all tissues rather than by special glands(Speroff & Fritz, 2005). Prostaglandins increase duringfollicular maturation and play a key role in ovulation byfreeing the ovum inside the graaan follicle. Large amountsof prostaglandins are found in menstrual blood. Researchis ongoing as to the various roles prostaglandins have onthe menstrual cycle (Cunningham et al., 2005). Menopause Perimenopause and menopause are biologic markers of the transition from young adulthood to middle age. Neitherof these is a symptom or disease, but rather a naturalmaturing of the reproductive system. During the perimenopausal years (2 to 8 years prior to menopause) women may experience physical changesassociated with decreasing estrogen levels, which mayinclude vasomotor symptoms of hot flashes, irregular men-strual cycles, sleep disruptions, forgetfulness, irritability,mood disturbances, decreased vaginal lubrication, fatigue,vaginal atrophy, and depression (Shifren & Schiff, 2007). Menopause refers to the cessation of regular menstrual cycles. This naturally occurring phase of every woman's lifemarks the end of menstruation and childbearing capac-ity. The average age of natural menopause\u2014defined as1 year without a menstrual period\u2014is 51 (Alexander et al.,2007). As the average life expectancy for women increases,the number of women reaching and living in menopausehas escalated. Most women can expect to spend more thanone third of their lives beyond menopause. It is usuallymarked by atrophy of the breasts, uterus, fallopian tubes,and ovaries (Curran & Bachmann, 2006). Many women pass through menopause without unto- ward symptoms. These women remain active and in goodhealth with little interruption of their daily routines. Otherwomen experience vasomotor symptoms, which give riseto sensations of heat, cold, sweating, headache, insomnia,BOX 3.1 Summary of Menstrual Cycle Hormones Luteinizing hormone (LH) rises and stimulates the follicle to produce estrogen. As estrogen is produced by the follicle, estrogen levels rise, inhibiting the output of LH. Ovulation occurs after an LH surge damages the estrogen-producing cells, resulting in a decline in estrogen. The LH surge results in establishment of the corpus luteum, which produces estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone levels rise, suppressing LH output. Lack of LH promotes degeneration of the corpus luteum. Cessation of the corpus luteum means a decline in estrogen and progesterone output. The decline of the ovarian hormones ends their negative effect on the secretion of LH. LH is secreted, and the menstrual cycle begins again.11223-03_UT2-CH03.qxd 8/4/08 2:39 PM Page 56CHAPTER 3 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 57 ones, the corpora cavernosa, are side by side. The third sinus, the corpus spongiosum, surrounds the urethra.Erection results when nerve impulses from the autonomicnervous system dilate the arteries of the penis, allowingarterial blood to flow into the erectile tissues of the organ. Scrotum The scrotum is the thin-skinned sac that surrounds andprotects the testes. The scrotum also acts as a climate-control system for the testes, because they need to beslightly cooler than body temperature to allow normalsperm development. The cremaster muscles in the scrotalwall relax or contract to allow the testes to hang fartherfrom the body to cool or to be pulled closer to the bodyfor warmth or protection (Ceo, 2006). A medial septumdivides the scrotum into two chambers, each of whichencloses a testis. Internal Male Reproductive Organs The internal structures include the testes, the ductal system, and accessory glands (Fig. 3.9). ScrotumPenis shaft Glans penis FIGURE3.7 The external male reproductive organs. (Photo by B. Proud.) FIGURE3.8 The urinary meatus. (Photo by B. Proud.)and irritability (Kessenich, 2007). Until recently, hormone therapy was the mainstay of menopause pharmacother-apy, but with the recent results of the Women's HealthInitiative trial, the use of hormone therapy has become con-troversial. Many women have turned to nontraditionalremedies to manage their menopausal symptoms. Com-mon herbal remedies used include Dong Quai, blackcohosh, melatonin, ginseng, and St. John's wort. Researchto validate their efficacy, safety, and potential harmfuleffects is lacking at this time, and much of the efficacyis largely anecdotal (Kessenich, 2007). Nurses can play amajor role in assisting menopausal women by educatingand counseling them about the multitude of options avail-able for disease prevention, treatment for menopausalsymptoms, and health promotion during this time ofchange in their lives. Menopause should be an oppor-tunity for women to strive for a healthy, long life, andnurses can help to make this opportunity a reality. (SeeChapter 4 for more information about menopause.) Recall Linda, who was experiencing changes in her menstrual patterns. Which hormones might be changing, andwhich systems might they affect? What approach should thenurse take to enlighten Linda about what is happening to her? Male Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology The male reproductive system, like that of the female, consists of those organs that facilitate reproduction. Themale organs are specialized to produce and maintainthe male sex cells, or sperm; to transport them, along withsupporting fluids, to the female reproductive system; andto secrete the male hormone testosterone. The organs ofthe male reproductive system include the two testes (wheresperm cells and testosterone are made), the penis, the scro-tum, and the accessory organs (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory duct, urethra, bulbourethralglands, and prostate gland). External Male Reproductive Organs The penis and the scrotum form the external genitalia inthe male (Fig. 3.7). Penis The penis is the organ for copulation and serves as the out- let for both sperm and urine. The skin of the penis is thin,with no hairs. The prepuce (foreskin) is a circular fold ofskin that extends over the glans unless it is removed by cir-cumcision shortly after birth. The urinary meatus, locatedat the tip of the penis, serves as the external opening to theurethra (Fig. 3.8). The penis is composed mostly of erec-tile tissue. Most of the body of the penis consists of threecylindrical spaces (sinuses) of erectile tissue. The two larger11223-03_UT2-CH03.qxd 8/4/08 2:39 PM Page 57Testes The testes are oval bodies the size of large olives that lie in the scrotum; usually the left testis hangs a little lowerthan the right one. The testes have two functions: pro-ducing sperm and synthesizing testosterone (the primarymale sex hormone). Sperm is produced in the seminiferoustubules of the testes. Similar to the female reproductivesystem, the anterior pituitary releases the gonadotro-pins, FSH and LH. These hormones stimulate the testes to produce testosterone, which assists in maintainingspermatogenesis, increases sperm production by the sem-iniferous tubules, and stimulates production of seminalfluid (London, Ladewig, Ball & Bindler 2007). The epi-didymis, which lies against the testes, is a coiled tube al-most 20 feet long. It collects sperm from the testes andprovides the space and environment for sperm to mature(Fig. 3.10). The Ductal System The vas deferens is a cordlike duct that transports spermfrom the epididymis. One such duct travels from eachtestis up to the back of the prostate and enters the urethrato form the ejaculatory ducts. Other structures, such asblood vessels and nerves, also travel along with each vasdeferens and together form the spermatic cord. The ure-thra is the terminal duct of the reproductive and urinarysystems, serving as a passageway for semen (fluid con-taining sperm) and urine. It passes through the prostategland and the penis and opens to the outside.58 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Accessory Glands The seminal vesicles, which produce nutrient seminal fluid, and the prostate gland, which produces alkalineprostatic fluid, are both connected to the ejaculatory ductleading into the urethra. The paired seminal vesicles are Prostate gland Vas deferns FIGURE3.10 Internal structures of a testis.FIGURE3.9 Lateral view of the internal male reproductive organs. (Source: AnatomicalChart Company. [2001]. Atlas of Page 58convoluted pouch-like structures posterior to, and at the base of, the urinary bladder in front of the rectum.They secrete an alkaline fluid that contains fructose andprostaglandins. The fructose supplies energy to the spermon its journey to meet the ovum, and the prostaglandinsassist in sperm mobility. The prostate gland lies just under the bladder in the pelvis and surrounds the middle portion of the urethra.Usually the size of a walnut, this gland enlarges with age.The prostate and the seminal vesicles above it producefluid that nourishes the sperm. This fluid provides mostof the volume of semen, the secretion in which the spermis expelled during ejaculation. Other fluid that makes upthe semen comes from the vas deferens and from mucousglands in the head of the penis. The bulbourethral glands (Cowper's glands) are two small structures about the size of peas, located inferior tothe prostate gland. They are composed of several tubeswhose epithelial linings secrete a mucus-like fluid. It is re-leased in response to sexual stimulation and lubricates thehead of the penis in preparation for sexual intercourse.Their existence is said to be constant, but they graduallydiminish in size with advancing age. Male Sexual Response With sexual stimulation, the arteries leading to the penis di- late and increase blood flow into erectile tissues. At thesame time, the erectile tissue compresses the veins of thepenis, reducing blood flow away from the penis. Blood ac-cumulates, causing the penis to swell and elongate and pro-ducing an erection. As in women, the culmination of sexualstimulation is an orgasm, a pleasurable feeling of physio-logic and psychological release. Orgasm is accompanied by emission (movement of sperm from the testes and fluids from the accessory glands)into the urethra, where it is mixed to form semen. As theurethra fills with semen, the base of the erect penis con-tracts, which increases pressure and forces the sementhrough the urethra to the outside (ejaculation). Duringejaculation, the ducts of the testes, epididymis, and vasdeferens contract, causing expulsion of sperm into the ure-thra, where the sperm mixes with the seminal and prosta-tic fluids. These substances, together with mucus secretedby accessory glands, form the semen, which is dischargedfrom the urethra. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546The female reproductive system produces the female reproductive cells (the eggs, or ova) and contains anorgan (uterus) where the fetus develops. The male reproductive system produces the male reproductivecells (the sperm) and contains an organ (penis) thatdeposits the sperm within the female.CHAPTER 3 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 59 /H18546The internal female reproductive organs consist of the vagina, the uterus, the fallopian tubes, and the ovaries.The external female reproductive organs make up thevulva.

Women today can expect to live well into their80s and need to be proactive in maintaining their ownquality of life. Women need to take steps to reduce theirrisk of disease and need to become active partners withtheir health care professional to identify problems early,when treatment may be most successful (Teaching Guide-lines 4.1). Nurses can assist women in maintaining theirquality of life by helping them to become more attuned totheir body and its clues and can use the assessment periodas an opportunity for teaching and counseling. Common reproductive issues addressed in this chap- ter that nurses might encounter in caring for women include menstrual disorders, infertility, contraception,abortion, and menopause. Menstrual Disorders Many women sail through their monthly menstrual cycleswith little or no concern. With few symptoms to worryabout, their menses are like clockwork, starting and stop-ping at nearly the same time every month. For others, themenstrual cycle causes physical and emotional symptomsthat initiate visits to their health care provider for consul-tation. The following menstruation-related conditions willbe discussed in this syn-drome (PMS), premenstrual disorder (PMDD),and endometriosis. To gain an understanding of men-strual disorders, it is important to know the terms used indescribing them (Box 4.1).AMENORRHEA Amenorrhea is the absence of menses during the repro- ductive years. Amenorrhea is normal in prepubertal,pregnant, and postmenopausal females. The two cate-gories of amenorrhea are primary and secondary amen-orrhea. Primary amenorrhea is dened as either: 1. Absence of menses by age 14, with absence of growth and development of secondary sexualcharacteristics, or 2. Absence of menses by age 16, with normal develop- ment of secondary sexual characteristics (Bielak &Harris, 2006) Ninety-eight percent of American girls (Krantz, 2007a, 2007b). Secondary amenorrhea isthe absence of menses for three cycles or 6 months inwomen who have previously menstruated regularly. Etiology There are multiple causes of primary amenorrhea: Extreme weight gain or loss Congenital abnormalities of the reproductive system Stress from a major life event Excessive exercise Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa or bulimia) Cushing's disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian or adrenal tumors & Heiman, 2006) Causes of secondary amenorrhea might include: Pregnancy BreastfeedingG TEACHING GUIDELINES 4.1 Tips for Being an Active Partner in Managing Your Health Become an informed consumer. Read, ask, and search. Know your family history and know factors that put you at high risk. Maintain a healthy lifestyle and let moderation be your guide. Schedule regular medical checkups and screenings for early detection. Ask your health care professional for a full explanation of any treatment. Seek a second medical opinion if you feel you need more information. Know when to seek medical care by being aware of disease symptoms.BOX 4.1 Menstrual Disorder Vocabulary Meno =menstrual-related Metro =time A =without, Dys or pain 2:40 PM Page 6364 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Emotional stress Pituitary, ovarian, or adrenal tumors Depression Hyperthyroid or hypothyroid conditions Malnutrition Hyperprolactinemia Rapid weight gain or loss Chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the pelvic area Vigorous exercise, such as long-distance running Kidney failure Colitis Use of tranquilizers or antidepressants Postpartum pituitary necrosis (Sheehan syndrome) Early menopause (Bielak & Harris, 2006) Therapeutic Management Therapeutic intervention depends on the cause of theamenorrhea. The treatment of primary amenorrhea in-volves the correction of any underlying disorders and es-trogen replacement therapy to stimulate the developmentof secondary sexual characteristics. If a pituitary tumor isthe cause, it might be treated with drug therapy, surgicalresection, or radiation therapy. Surgery might be neededto correct any structural abnormalities of the genital tract.Therapeutic interventions for secondary amenorrhea mayinclude: Cyclic progesterone, when the cause is anovulation, or oral contraceptives Bromocriptine to treat hyperprolactinemia Nutritional counseling to address anorexia, bulimia, or obesity Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), when the cause is hypothalamic failure Thyroid hormone replacement, when the cause is hypothyroidism (Schuiling & Likis, 2006) Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment for the young girl or woman expe-riencing amenorrhea includes a thorough health historyand physical examination and several laboratory and di-agnostic tests. Health History and Physical Examination A thorough history and physical examination is neededto determine the etiology. The history should includequestions about the women's menstrual history; past ill-nesses; hospitalizations and obstetric over-the-counter drugs; recent orpast lifestyle changes; and history of present illness, withan assessment of any bodily changes. The physical examination should begin with an over- all assessment of the woman's nutritional status and gen-eral health. A sensitive and gentle approach to the pelvicexamination is critical in young women. Height and weightshould be taken, along with vital signs. Hypothermia,bradycardia, hypotension, and reduced subcutaneous fat may be observed in women with anorexia nervosa. Facialhair and acne might be evidence of androgen excess sec-ondary to a tumor. The presence or absence of axillary andpubic hair may indicate adrenal and ovarian hyposecretionor delayed puberty. A general physical examination mayuncover unexpected ndings that are indirectly related toamenorrhea. For example, hepatosplenomegaly, whichmay suggest a chronic systemic disease or an enlarged thy-roid gland, might point to a thyroid disorder as well as areason for amenorrhea (Nelson & Bakalov, 2006). Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory tests that might be ordered to deter-mine the cause of amenorrhea include: Karyotype (might be positive for Turner syndrome) Ultrasound to detect ovarian cysts Pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy Thyroid function studies to determine thyroid disorder Prolactin level (an elevated level might indicate a pitu- itary tumor) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (an elevated level might indicate ovarian failure) Luteinizing hormone (LH) level (an elevated level might indicate gonadal dysfunction) 17-ketosteroids (an elevated level might indicate an adrenal tumor) Laparoscopy to detect polycystic ovary syndrome CT scan of head if a pituitary tumor is suspected (Pagana & Pagana, 2007) Nursing Management Counseling and education are primary interventions andappropriate nursing roles. Address the diverse causes ofamenorrhea, the relationship to sexual identity, possi-ble infertility, and the possibility of a tumor or a life-threatening disease. In addition, inform the woman aboutthe purpose of each diagnostic test, how it is performed,and when the results will be available to discuss with her.Sensitive listening, interviewing, and presenting treatment options are paramount to gain the woman's cooperationand understanding. Nutritional counseling is also vital in managing this disorder, especially if the woman has ndings suggestiveof an eating disorder. Although not all causes can be ad-dressed by making lifestyle changes, emphasize maintain-ing a healthy lifestyle (Teaching Guidelines 4.2). DYSMENORRHEA Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstruation. This condi- tion has also been termed cyclic perimenstrual The term dysmenorrhea is 2:40 PM Page 64the Greek words \"dys,\" meaning difcult, painful, or ab- normal, and \"rrhea,\" meaning flow. It may affect morethan half of menstruating women (Smith, 2006). Uterinecontractions occur during all periods, but in some womenthese cramps can be frequent and very intense. Dysmen-orrhea is categorized as primary or secondary. Etiology Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by increased prosta- glandin production by the endometrium in an ovulatorycycle. This hormone causes contraction of the uterus, andlevels tend to be higher in women with severe menstrualpain than women who experience mild or no menstrualpain. These levels are highest during the rst 2 days ofmenses, when symptoms peak (Doty & Attaran, 2006).This results in increased rhythmic uterine contractionsfrom vasoconstriction of the small vessels of the uterinewall. This condition usually begins within a few years ofthe onset of ovulatory cycles at menarche. Secondary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation due to pelvic or uterine pathology. It may be caused byendometriosis, adenomyosis, broids, pelvic infection, anintrauterine device, cervical or vaginal abnormalities. Adenomyosis involves theingrowth of the endometrium into the uterine muscula-ture. Endometriosis involves ectopic implantation of en-dometrial tissue in other parts of the pelvis. It occursmost commonly in the third or fourth decades of life andaffects 10% of women of reproductive age (Hompes &Mijatovic, 2007). Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea and is associated withpain beyond menstruation, dyspareunia, and infertility(Speroff & Fritz, 2005). Treatment is directed toward re-moving the underlying pathology. Think back to Izzy from the chapter opener. Is her pelvic pain complaint a common one with women? Therapeutic Management Therapeutic intervention is directed toward pain relief and building coping strategies that will promote a produc-tive lifestyle. Treatment measures usually include treatinginfections if present; suppressing the endometrium if en-dometriosis is suspected by administering low-dose oralcontraceptives; administering prostaglandin inhibitors toreduce the pain; administering Depo-Provera; and initiat-ing lifestyle changes. Table 4.1 lists selected treatmentoptions for dysmenorrhea. Nursing Assessment As with any gynecologic complaint, a thorough focused history and physical examination is needed to make thediagnosis of primary or secondary dysmenorrhea. In pri-mary dysmenorrhea, the history usually reveals the typicalcramping pain with menstruation, and the physical exam-ination is completely normal. In secondary dysmenorrhea,the history discloses cramping pain starting after 25 yearsold with a pelvic abnormality, a history of infertility, heavymenstrual flow, irregular cycles, and little response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral contra-ceptives, or both (Harel, 2006). Health History and Clinical Manifestations Note past medical history, including any chronic illnesses and family history of gynecologic concerns. Determinemedication and substance use, such as prescription med-ications, contraceptives, anabolic steroids, tobacco, andmarijuana, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. A detailed sex-ual history is essential to assess for inflammation and scar-ring (adhesions) secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease(PID). Women with a previous history of PID, sexuallytransmitted infections (STIs), multiple sexual partners, orunprotected sex are at increased risk. During the initial interview, the nurse might ask some of the following questions to assess the woman's history ofdysmenorrhea: \"At what age did you start your menstrual cycles?\" \"Have your cycles always been painful, or did the pain start recently?\" \"When in your cycle do you experience the pain?\" \"How would you describe the pain you feel?\"Source: Nelson & Bakalov, 2006.TEACHING GUIDELINES 4.2 Tips for Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle Balance energy expenditure with energy intake. Modify your diet to maintain ideal weight. Avoid excessive use of alcohol and mood-altering or sedative drugs. Avoid cigarette smoking. Identify areas of emotional stress and seek assistance to resolve them. Balance work, recreation, and rest. Maintain a positive outlook regarding the diagnosis and prognosis. Participate in ongoing care to monitor any medical conditions. Maintain bone density through: Calcium intake (1,200 to 1,500 mg daily) Weight-bearing exercise (30 minutes or more daily) Hormone therapyCHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 6511223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 6566 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN \"Are you sexually active?\" \"What impact does your cycle have on your physical and social activity?\" \"When was the rst day of your last menstrual cycle?\" \"Was the flow of your last menstrual cycle a normal amount for you?\" \"Do your cycles tend to be heavy or last longer than 5 days?\" \"Are your cycles generally regular and predictable?\" \"What have you done to relieve your discomfort? Is it effective?\" \"Has there been a progression of symptom severity?\" \"Do you have any other symptoms?\" Assess for clinical manifestations of dysmenorrhea. Af- fected women experience sharp, intermittent spasms ofpain, usually in the suprapubic area. Pain may radiate to theback of the legs or the lower back. Pain usually developswithin hours of the start of menstruation and peaks as theflow becomes heaviest during the rst day or two of thecycle (Edmundson & Erogul, 2006). Systemic symptomsof nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, headache, ordizziness are fairly common. Explore the history for physi-cal symptoms of bloating, water retention, weight gain, headache, muscle aches, abdominal pain, food cravings, orbreast tenderness. Physical Examination The physical examination performed by the health careprovider centers on the bimanual pelvic examination. Thisexamination is done during the nonmenstrual phase ofthe cycle. Explain to the woman how it is to be performed,especially if is her rst pelvic examination. Prepare thewoman in the examining room by offering her a covergown to put on and covering her lap with a privacy sheeton the examination table. Remain in the examining roomthroughout the examination to assist the health careprovider with any procedures or specimens and to offerthe woman reassurance. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory tests that may be ordered to deter-mine the cause of dysmenorrhea might include: Complete blood count to rule out anemia Urinalysis to rule out a bladder infectionTherapy Options Dosage CommentsTABLE 4.1 TREATMENT OPTIONS (42/7 days; 63/7 or 84/7) 150 mg IM every 12 wksTake with meals.

Nursing Management Educating the client about the normal events of the men-strual cycle and the etiology of her pain is paramount inachieving a successful outcome. Explaining the normalmenstrual cycle will teach the woman the correct terms soshe can communicate her symptoms more accurately andwill help dispel myths. Provide the woman with monthlygraphs or charts to record menses, the onset of pain, thetiming of medication, relief afforded, and coping strategiesused. This involves the woman in her care and providesobjective information so that therapy can be modied ifnecessary. The nurse should explain in detail the dosing regimen and the side effects of the medication therapy selected.Commonly prescribed drugs include NSAIDs such asibuprofen (Motrin), Advil.They alleviate by in-trauterine pressure and inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis,thus reducing pain (Skidmore-Roth, 2007). If pain relief isnot achieved in two to four cycles, a low-dose combinationoral contraceptive may be initiated. Client teaching andcounseling should include information about how to takepills, side effects, and danger signs to watch for. Encourage the woman to apply a heating pad or warm compress to alleviate menstrual cramps. Additional lifestylechanges that the woman can make to restore some senseof control and active participation in her care are listed inTeaching Guidelines 4.3. DYSFUNCTIONAL UTERINE BLEEDING Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a disorder that occurs most frequently in women at the beginning andend of their reproductive years. Dened as irregular, ab-normal bleeding that occurs with no identiable anatomicpathology, it affects 33% to 50% of women (Rackow & Arici, 2007). It is frequently associated with anovulatorycycles, which are common for the rst year after menarcheand later in life as women approach menopause. The pathophysiology of DUB is related to a hormone disturbance. With anovulation, estrogen levels rise as usualin the early phase of the menstrual cycle. In the absence ofovulation, a corpus luteum never forms and progesteroneis not produced. The endometrium moves into a hyper-proliferative state, ultimately outgrowing its estrogen sup-ply. This leads to irregular sloughing of the endometriumand excessive bleeding (Aeby & Frattarelli, 2006). If thebleeding is heavy enough and frequent enough, anemiacan result. DUB is similar to several other types of uterine bleed- ing disorders and sometimes overlaps these conditions.They include: Menorrhagia (abnormally long, heavy periods) Oligomenorrhea (bleeding occurs at intervals of more than 35 days) Metrorrhagia (bleeding between periods) Menometrorrhagia (bleeding occurs at irregular inter- vals with heavy flow lasting more than 7 days) Polymenorrhea (too frequent periods) Etiology The possible causes of DUB may include: Adenomyosis PregnancySource: Nasir, 2007.TEACHING GUIDELINES 4.3 Tips to Manage Dysmenorrhea Exercise to increase endorphins and suppress prostaglandin release. Limit salty foods to prevent fluid retention. Increase water consumption to serve as a natural diuretic. Increase ber intake with fruits and vegetables to prevent constipation. Use heating pads or warm baths to increase comfort. Take warm showers to promote relaxation. Sip on warm beverages, such as decaffeinated green tea. Keep legs elevated while lying down or lie on side with knees bent. Use stress management techniques to reduce emotional stress. Practice relaxation techniques to enhance ability to cope with pain. Stop smoking and decrease alcohol use.CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 6711223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 6768 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Hormonal imbalance Fibroid tumors (see Chapter 7) Endometrial polyps or cancer Endometriosis Intrauterine device (IUD) Polycystic ovary syndrome Morbid obesity Steroid therapy Hypothyroidism Blood dyscrasias/clotting disorder Therapeutic Management Treatment of DUB depends on the cause of the bleedingand the age of the client. When known, the underlyingcause of the disorder is treated. Otherwise, the goal oftreatment is to relieve the symptoms so that uterine bleed-ing does not interfere with a woman's normal activities orcause anemia (Dodds & Sinert, 2006). Management of DUB might include medical care with pharmacotherapy or insertion of an IUD. Oral contra-ceptives are used for cycle regulation as well as contracep-tion. They help prevent the risks associated with prolongedunopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium.NSAIDs and the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (Mirena)decrease menstrual blood loss significantly (Lethaby,Cooke & Rees, 2006). The drug categories used in thetreatment of DUB are: Estrogens: cause vasospasm of the uterine arteries to decrease bleeding Progestins: used to stabilize an estrogen-primed endometrium Oral contraceptives: regulate the cycle and salts: replenish iron stores lost during heavy bleeding If the client does not respond to medical therapy, sur- gical intervention might alternative to hysterectomy. A thermalballoon or a laser is used to ablate the tissue, producingimprovement in 90% of women (Speroff & Fritz, 2005). Nursing Assessment A thorough history should be taken to differentiate be-tween DUB and other conditions that might cause vaginalbleeding, such as pregnancy and pregnancy-related condi-tions (abruptio placentae, as Cushing dis-ease, blood dyscrasias, liver disease, renal disease, or thy-roid disease; and genital tract pathology such as infections,tumors, or trauma (Hackley, Kriebs & Rousseau, 2007).Assess for clinical manifestations of DUB, which com- monly include vaginal bleeding between periods, irregularmenstrual cycles (usually less than 28 days between cycles),infertility, mood swings, hot flashes, vaginal tenderness,variable menstrual flow ranging from scanty to profuse,obesity, acne, and diabetes. Signs of polycystic ovary syn-drome might be present, since it is associated with unop-posed estrogen stimulation, elevated androgen levels, andinsulin resistance and is a common cause of anovulation(Torpy, 2007). Measure orthostatic blood pressure and orthostatic pulse; a drop in pressure or pulse rate may occur withanemia. The health care provider, with the nurse assist-ing, performs a pelvic examination to identify any struc-tural abnormalities. Common laboratory tests that may be ordered to determine the cause of DUB include: Complete blood count to detect anemia Prothrombin time (PT) to detect blood dyscrasias Pregnancy test to rule out a spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level to screen for hypothyroidism Transvaginal ultrasound to measure endometrium Pelvic ultrasound to view any structural abnormalities Endometrial biopsy to check for intrauterine pathology D&C for diagnostic evaluation Nursing Management Educate the client about normal menstrual cycles and thepossible reasons for her abnormal pattern. Inform thewoman about treatment options. Do not simply encour-age the woman to \"live with it\": complications such as in-fertility can result from lack of ovulation; severe anemiacan occur secondary to prolonged or heavy menses; andendometrial cancer can occur associated with prolongedbuildup of the endometrial lining without menstrualbleeding (Rackow & Arici, 2007). Instruct her about anyprescribed medications and potential side effects. For ex-ample, if high-dose estrogens are prescribed, the womanmay experience nausea. Teach her to take antiemetics asprescribed and encourage her to eat small, frequent mealsto alleviate nausea. Adequate follow-up and evaluation forwomen who do not respond to medical management is es-sential. See Nursing Care Plan 4.1: Overview of a WomanWith Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB). PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) describes a wide range of recurrent symptoms that occur during the lutealphase or last half of the menstrual cycle and resolve withthe onset of menstruation (Braverman & Neinstein,11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 cologists (ACOG) denes premenstrual of symptoms that are sufciently severeto interfere with some aspects of life, and that appearwith consistent and predictable relationship to menses\" (ACOG, 2000). A woman experiencing PMS may have awide variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms; for that reason, it is difficult to define and more challenging todiagnose. PMS affects millions of women during theirreproductive years: up to 85% of menstruating womenreport having one more premenstrual symptoms, andup to 10% report disabling, incapacitating symptoms Nursing Care Plan 4.1 OVERVIEW OF A WOMAN WITH DYSFUNCTIONAL UTERINE BLEEDING (DUB) Stacy, a 52-year-old obese woman, comes to her gynecologist with the complaint of heavy erratic bleeding. Her periods were fairly regular until about 4 months ago, and since that time they have been unpredictable, excessive, and prolonged.Stacy reports she is tired all the time, can't sleep, and feels \"out of sorts\" and anxious. She is fearful she has cancer. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Fear related to current signs and symptoms possibly indicating a life-threatening condition Outcome Identication and Evaluation The client will acknowledge her fears as evidenced by statements made that fear and anxiety have been lessened after explanation of diagnosis. Interventions: Reducing Fear and Anxiety Distinguish between anxiety and fear to determine appropriate interventions. Check complete blood count and assess for possible anemia secondary to excessive bleeding to determine if fatigue iscontributing to anxiety and fear. Fatigue occurs because the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced. Reassure client that symptoms can be managed to help address her current concerns. Provide client with factual information and explain what to expect to assist client with identifying fears and help in hercoping with her condition. Provide symptom management to reduce concerns associated with the cause of bleeding. Teach client about early manifestations of fear and anxiety to aid in prompt recognition and to minimize escalation ofanxiety. Assess client's use of coping strategies in the past and reinforce use of effective ones to help control anxiety and fear. Instruct client in relaxation methods, such as deep breathing exercises and imagery, to provide her with additionalmethods for controlling anxiety and fear. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Decient knowledge related to perimenopause and its management Outcome Identication and Evaluation The client will demonstrate understanding of her symptoms as evidenced by making health-promoting lifestyle choices, verbalizing appropriate health care practices, and adhering to measures to comply with therapy. Interventions: Providing Patient Education Assess client's understanding of perimenopause and its treatment to provide a baseline for teaching and developing aplan of care. Review instructions about prescribed procedures and recommendations for self-care, frequently obtaining feedback fromthe client to validate adequate understanding of information. Outline link between anovulatory cycles and excessive buildup of uterine lining in perimenopausal women to assist clientin understanding the etiology of her bleeding. Provide written material with pictures to promote learning and help client visualize what is occurring to her body duringperimenopause. Inform client about the availability of community resources and make appropriate referrals as needed to provide additionaleducation and support. Document details of teaching and learning to allow for continuity of care and further education, if needed.CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 6911223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 6970 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN (Campagne & Campagne, 2007). The exact cause of PMS is not known. It is thought to be related to the inter-action between hormonal events and neurotransmitterfunction, specically serotonin. Not all women respond toserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), however, which im-plies that other mechanisms may be involved (Braverman& Neinstein, 2007). As defined by the American Psychological Associa- tion, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a moresevere variant of PMS. Experts compare the differencebetween PMS and PMDD to the difference between amild tension headache and a migraine (Giulio & Reissing,2006). PMDD markedly interferes with work and school,or with social activities and relationships with others. Therapeutic Management Treatment of PMS is often frustrating for both patientsand health care providers. Clinical outcomes can be ex-pected to improve as a result of recent consensus on thediagnostic criteria for PMS and PMDD, data from clin-ical trials, and the availability of evidence-based clinicalguidelines. The management of PMS or PMDD requires a multi- dimensional approach because these conditions are notlikely to have a single cause, and they appear to affectmultiple systems within a woman's body; therefore, theyare not likely to be amenable to treatment with a singletherapy. To reduce the negative impact of premenstrualdisorders on a woman's life, education, along with reassur-ance and anticipatory guidance, are needed for women tofeel they have some control over their condition.Many women use dietary supplements and herbal remedies for their menstrual health and treating theirbleeding disorders, although there has been little researchto demonstrate their efcacy. Some alternative therapiesused might Although research hasn't validated alter-native therapy's efcacy, it is important for the nurse tobe aware of the alternative products that many womenchoose to use. Nursing Assessment Although little consensus exists in the medical literatureand among researchers about what constitutes PMS andPMDD, the physical and psychological symptoms arevery real. The extent to which the symptoms debilitate orincapacitate a woman is highly variable. There are more than 200 symptoms assigned to PMS, but irritability, tension, and dysphoria are the most promi-nent and consistently described (Moreno & Giesel, 2006).To establish the diagnosis of PMS, elicit a description ofcyclic symptoms occurring before the woman's menstrualperiod. The woman should chart her symptoms daily fortwo cycles. These data will help demonstrate symptomsTherapeutic interventions for PMS and PMDD ad- dress the symptoms because the exact cause of this con-dition is still unknown. Treatments may include vitaminsupplements, diet changes, exercise, lifestyle changes, andmedications (Box 4.2). Medications used in treatingPMDD may include antidepressant and antianxiety drugs,diuretics, anti-inflammatory to regulate menses (Pavlovich-Danis, 2007).BOX 4.2 Treatment Options for PMS and PMDD Lifestyle changes: Reduce stress.Exercise three to ve times each week.Eat a balanced diet and increase water intake.Decrease caffeine intake.Stop smoking.Limit intake of alcohol.Attend a PMS/women's support group. Vitamin and mineral supplements Multivitamin dailyVitamin E, 400 units dailyCalcium, 1,200 mg dailyMagnesium, 200 to 400 mg daily Medications NSAIDs taken a week prior to mensesOral contraceptives (low dose)Antidepressants (SSRIs)Anxiolytics (taken during agonists)Danazol (androgen hormone inhibits estrogen production) Take NOTE! Because there are no diagnostic tests that can reliably determine the existence of PMS or PMDD, it is the woman herself who must decidethat she needs help during this time of the month. Thewoman must embrace multiple therapies and becomean active participant in her treatment plan to nd thebest level of symptom relief.11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page around the luteal phase of ovulation, with reso- lution after bleeding starts. Ask the woman to bring her listof symptoms to the next appointment. Symptoms can becategorized using the following: clumsiness C: headache, cravings for sweets, salty foods, chocolate D: depression: feelings of low self-esteem, anger, easily upset H: hydration: weight gain, abdominal bloating, breast tenderness O: other: hot flashes or cold sweats, nausea, change in bowel habits, aches or pains, dysmenorrhea, acnebreakout (Pavlovich-Danis, 2007) The ACOG diagnostic criteria for PMS consist of having at least one of the following affective and somaticsymptoms during the 5 days before menses in each of previous tenderness, abdominal bloating, edema, headache Symptoms relieved from days 4 to 13 of the menstrual cycle (ACOG, 2000) In PMDD, the main symptoms are mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, tension, and persistent angeror irritability. Physical symptoms such as headache, jointand muscle pain, lack of energy, bloating, and breasttenderness are also present (Hsiao & Liu, 2007). It is es-timated that 20% to 40% of reproductive-age womenexperience premenstrual symptoms that meet the ACOGcriteria for PMS and up to 10% meet the diagnostic cri-teria for PMDD (Futterman & Rapkin, 2006). According to the American Psychiatric Association, a woman must have at least ve of the typical symptoms tobe diagnosed with PMDD (Andoisek & Rapkin, 2007).These must occur during the week before and a few daysafter the onset of menstruation and must include one ormore of the rst four symptoms: 1. Affective lability: sadness, tearfulness, irritability 2. Anxiety and tension3. Persistent or marked anger or irritability4. Depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness5. Difculty concentrating6. Sleep difculties7. Increased or decreased appetite8. Increased or decreased sexual desire9. Chronic fatigue 10. Headache11. Constipation or diarrhea12. Breast swelling and tenderness (Htay & Aung, 2006)Nursing Management Educate the client about the management of PMS or PMDD. Advise her that lifestyle changes often result insignicant symptom improvement without pharmaco-therapy. Encourage women to eat a balanced diet thatincludes nutrient-rich foods to avoid hypoglycemia andassociated mood swings. Encourage adolescent girls toparticipate in aerobic exercise three times a week to pro-mote a sense of well-being, decrease fatigue, and reducestress. Administer calcium (1,200 to 1,600 mg/day),magnesium (400 to 800 mg/day), and vitamin B6 (50 to100 mg/day) as prescribed. In some studies, these nutri-ents have been shown to decrease the intensity of PMSsymptoms. NSAIDs may be useful for painful physicalsymptoms and spironolactone (Aldactone) may help withbloating and water retention. Herbs such as Vitex (chastetree berry), evening primrose, and SAM-e may be recom-mended; although not harmful, not all herbs have enough clinical or research evidence to document their safety orefcacy (Schuiling & Likis, 2006). A recent research study proposes calcium (1,600 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day) supplementation inadolescents and women in an effort to prevent PMS(Clayton, 2008). Explain the relationship between cyclic estrogen fluc- tuation and changes in serotonin levels and how the dif-ferent management strategies help maintain serotoninlevels, thus improving symptoms. It is important to ruleout other conditions that might cause erratic or dysphoricbehavior. If the initial treatment regimen does not work,explain to the woman that she should return for furthertesting. Behavioral counseling and stress managementmight help women regain control during these stressfulperiods. Reassuring the woman that support and help areavailable through many community resources/supportgroups can be instrumental in her acceptance of thismonthly disorder. Nurses can be a very calming force formany women experiencing PMS or PMDD. Adolescents and women who experience more extensive emotional symptoms with PMS should be evaluated for PMDD, as they may require antidepressant therapy.Take NOTE! ENDOMETRIOSIS Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecologic diseases, affecting more than 5.5 million women in theUnited States. In this condition, bits of functioning endo-metrial tissue are located outside of their normal site, theuterine cavity. This endometrial tissue is commonly foundCHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 7111223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 7172 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN attached to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, the outer surface of the uterus, the bowels, the area between the vagina andthe rectum (rectovaginal septum), and the pelvic side wall(Fig. 4.1). The places where the tissue attaches are calledimplants, or lesions. Endometrial tissue found outside theuterus responds to hormones released during the men-strual cycle in the same way as endometrial lining withinthe uterus. At the beginning of the menstrual cycle, when the lining of the uterus is shed and menstrual bleeding be-gins, these abnormally located implants swell and bleedalso. In short, the woman with endometriosis experiencesseveral \"mini-periods\" throughout her abdomen, wher-ever this endometrial tissue exists. Think back to Izzy, with her progressive pelvic pain and infertility concerns. After a pelvic examination, her healthcare provider suspects she has endometriosis. Etiology and Risk Factors It is not currently known why endometrial tissue becomes transplanted and grows in other parts of the body. Sev-eral theories exist, but to date none has been scienticallyproven. However, several factors that increase a woman'srisk of developing endometriosis have been identied: Increasing age Family history of endometriosis in a rst-degree relative Short menstrual cycle (less than 28 days) Long menstrual flow (more than 1 week) Young age of menarche (younger than 12) Few (one or two) or no pregnancies (Speroff & Fritz, 2005)Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of the client with endometrio- sis needs to take into consideration the following factors:severity of symptoms, desire for fertility, degree of dis-ease, and the client's therapy goals. The aim of therapy isto suppress levels of estrogen and progesterone, whichcause the endometrium to grow. Treatment can includesurgery or medication (Table 4.2). Nursing Assessment Nurses encounter women with endometriosis in a variety of settings: community health settings, schools, clinics, daysurgical centers, and hospitals. Health care professionalsmust not trivialize or dismiss the concerns of these women,because early recognition is essential to preserve fertility. Health History Obtain a health history and elicit a description of signs and symptoms to determine risk factors. Endometriosis is oftenasymptomatic, but it can be a severe and debilitating con-dition. It typically is chronic and progressive. Assess theclient for clinical manifestations, which include: Infertility Pain before and during menstrual periods Pain during or after sexual intercourse Painful urination Depression Fatigue Painful bowel movements Chronic pelvic pain Hypermenorrhea (heavy menses) Pelvic adhesions Umbilicus Scar on Cul-de-sac andbladder Uterine wall VulvaIleum Pelvic the posterior cul-de-sac (Saul & Dave, 2006). After a thorough history and a pelvic examination, the health care practitioner may suspect endometriosis, butthe only certain method of diagnosing it is by seeing it.Pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound is used to assess pelvicorgan structures. However, a laparoscopy is needed to di-agnose endometriosis. Laparoscopy is the direct visual-ization of the internal organs with a lighted instrumentinserted through an abdominal incision. A tissue biopsy ofthe suspected implant taken at the same time and exam-ined microscopically conrms the diagnosis. Nurses can play a role by offering a thorough explana- tion of the condition and explaining why tests are neededto diagnose endometriosis. The nurse can set up appoint-ments for imaging studies and laparoscopy. Nursing Management In addition to the interventions outlined above, the nurseshould encourage the client to adopt healthy lifestyle habitswith respect to diet, exercise, sleep, and stress manage-ment. Referrals to support groups and Internet resourcesSurgical intervention Conservative surgery Denitive surgery Medication OPTIONS FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS Removal of implants/lesions using laser, cautery, or small surgical instruments. This intervention will reduce painand allows pregnancy to occur in the future. Abdominal hysterectomy, with or without bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy. Will eliminate pain but will leave awoman unable to become pregnant in the future. First-line treatment to reduce pain; taken early when premenstrual symptoms are rst felt Suppresses cyclic hormonal response of the endometrial tissue Used to cast off the endometrial cells and thus destroy themSuppresses a woman's production of estrogen, thus stop- ping the menstrual cycle and preventing further growthof endometrium Suppresses endometriosis by creating a temporary pseudomenopause A synthetic androgen (male sex hormone) used typically as a second-line treatment of endometriosis. Disrupts theaction of the pituitary gland by suppressing the outputof some hormones, thus reducing estrogen, haltingmenstruation, and resulting in the growth of facial hairand acne. Irregular and more frequent menses Premenstrual vaginal spotting (Schuiling & Likis, 2006) The two most common symptoms are infertility and pain. Endometriosis occurs in 38% of infertile women andin 71% to 87% of women with chronic pelvic pain (Aeby& Hraoka, 2006). About 30% to 40% of women with thiscondition are infertile, making it one of the top threecauses of female infertility (NICHD, 2006). W hat are the two most common symptoms experienced by women with endometriosis? Is Izzy's profile typical? As a nurse, what would be your role in Izzy's continuedworkup? Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests The pelvic examination typically correlates with the extent of the endometriosis. The usual nding is nonspecicpelvic tenderness. The hallmark nding is the presenceof tender nodular masses on the uterosacral ligaments,CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 7311223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 7374 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN can help the woman to understand this condition and to cope with chronic pain. A number of organizations pro-vide information about the diagnosis and treatment ofendometriosis and offer support to women and their fam-ilies (Box 4.3). See Evidence-Based Practice 4.1. A fter completing several diagnostic tests, Izzy is diagnosed with endometriosis. She asks you about her chances ofbecoming pregnant and becoming pain-free. What treatmentoptions would you explain to Izzy? What information canyou give about her future childbearing ability? Infertility Infertility is dened as the inability to conceive a child after 1 year of regular sexual intercourse unprotected bycontraception, or the inability to carry a pregnancy toterm (Covington & Burns, 2006). Secondary infertilityis the inability to conceive after a previous pregnancy.Many people take the ability to conceive and produce a Source: Selak, V., Farquhar, C., Prentice, A., & Singla, A. (2006). Danazol for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. Cochrane Library, Retrieved Feb. 14, 2007, from the CINAHL Plus with Full Text database.Study Endometriosis is dened as the presence of endometrial tissue (stromal and glandular) outside the normal uterinecavity. Conventional medical and surgical treatments forendometriosis aim to remove or decrease deposits of ec-topic endometrium. The observation that hyperandrogenicstates (an excess of male hormone) induce atrophy of theendometrium has led to the use of androgens in the treat-ment of endometriosis. Danazol is one of these treat-ments. The efcacy of danazol is based on its ability toproduce a high-androgen/low-estrogen environment (apseudomenopause), which results in the atrophy of en-dometriotic implants and thus an improvement in painfulsymptoms. Only four trials met the inclusion criteria, and two authors independently extracted data from these trials. All four tri-als compared danazol to placebo. Two trials used danazolas sole therapy and two trials used danazol as an adjunctto surgery. Although the main outcome was pain improve-ment, other data relating to laparoscopic scores and hor-monal parameters were also collected.Findings Treatment with danazol was effective in relieving painfulsymptoms related to endometriosis when compared toplacebo. Laparoscopic scores were improved with danazoltreatment when compared with either placebo or no treat-ment. Side effects were more commonly reported in thepatients receiving danazol than those receiving placebo.Thus, danazol is effective in treating the symptoms andsigns of endometriosis. However, its use is limited by theoccurrence of androgenic side effects. Nursing Implications According to the results of the study, danazol is an effectivetreatment for relieving painful symptoms of endometriosis,but it has side effects. As a nurse, it is important to educatethe patient about these; they may include clitoral enlarge-ment and masculinization. In addition, the response to thedrug may take several weeks or months. Women should becautioned to report yellowing of the skin (jaundice), fluid re-tention, shortness of breath, and changes in vaginal bleed-ing. It is important to stress that there are several effectivetherapies to treat endometriosis if the side effects are prob-lematic with danazol. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 4.1 The Effectiveness of Danazol Compared to Placebo or No Treatment in the Treatment of the Symptoms and Signs (Other than Infertility) of Endometriosis in Women of Reproductive AgeBOX 4.3 Organizations and Web Resources to Assist the Client With Endometriosis American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG): www.acog.org or e-mail atresources@acog.org American Society of Reproductive Medicine: www.asrm.org or e-mail at Center Endometriosis Association: Information Resource Center: www.nichd. nih.gov or e-mail at NICHDClearinghouse@mail.nih.gov National Women's Health Information Center (Dept. of Health and Human Services):http://www.4women.gov11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 74child for granted, but infertility affects over 6 million Americans, or 15% of the reproductive-age population,according to the American Society for ReproductiveMedicine (ASRM, 2007). Infertility is a widespread prob-lem that has an emotional, social, and economic impacton couples. Nurses must recognize infertility and under-stand its causes and treatment options so that they canhelp couples understand the possibilities as well as thelimitations of current therapies. Recent studies found that women wished to be treated with respect and dignity andgiven appropriate information and support. They wantedtheir distress recognized and they wanted to feel cared forand to have confidence in health care professionals insituations where outcomes were uncertain. The caringaspect of professional nursing is an essential componentof meeting the special needs of these couples (Redshaw,Hockley & Davidson, 2007). Prevention of infertilitythrough education should also be incorporated into anyclient-nurse interaction. Cultural Considerations Cross-culturally, the expectation for couples to repro-duce is an accepted norm and the inability to conceivemay be considered a violation of this cultural norm. Inthis context, infertility represents a crisis for the couple.The manner in which different cultures, ethnic groups,and religious groups perceive and manage infertility maybe very different. For example, many African-Americansbelieve that assisted reproductive techniques are unnatu-ral and that they remove the spiritual or divine nature ofcreation from conception. For this reason, they may seekspiritual rather than medical assistance when trying toconceive. The Hispanic culture believes that children val-idate the marriage, so families are typically large. Like theAfrican-American culture, Hispanics are very spiritualand may consider infertility a test of faith and seek spiri-tual counseling. Religion often influences cultural factors and for this reason may also be considered when pursuing treatmentfor infertility. In the Jewish religion procreation is felt tobe an obligation and a responsibility. Roman Catholicshave a very restrictive view on the use of assisted repro-ductive technologies since in their view procreation can-not be separated from the relationship between parents.Thus, children must be created by the physical union be-tween husband and wife and conceived through sexualintercourse (Schenker, 2005). Nurses must be cognizantof the client's cultural and religious background and howit may dictate which, if any, reproductive treatment op-tions are chosen. Nurses need to include this awarenessin their counseling of infertile couples. Etiology and Risk Factors Multiple known and unknown factors affect fertility.Female-factor infertility is detected in about 40% of cases,male-factor infertility in about 40% of cases. The re- maining 20% fall into a category of combined (both maleand female factors) or unexplained infertility. In women,ovarian dysfunction (40%) and tubal/pelvic pathology(40%) are the primary contributing factors to infertility(ASRM, 2007). Risk factors for infertility include: For women: Overweight or underweight (can disrupt hormone function) Hormonal imbalances leading to irregular ovulation Fibroids Tubal blockages Reduced oocyte quality Chromosomal abnormalities Congenital anomalies of the cervix and uterus Immune system disorders Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, thyroid disease, asthma STIs Age older than 27 Endometriosis History of PID Smoking and alcohol consumption Multiple miscarriages Psychological stress (Kelly-Weeder & O'Conner, 2006) For men: Exposure to toxic substances (lead, mercury, x-rays) Cigarette or marijuana smoke Heavy alcohol consumption Use of prescription drugs for ulcers or psoriasis Exposure of the genitals to high temperatures (hot tubs or saunas) Hernia repair Frequent long-distance cycling STI Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) Mumps after puberty (Ficorelli & Weeks, 2007) Therapeutic Management The test results are presented to the couple and different treatment options are suggested. The majority of infertilitycases are treated with drugs or surgery. Various ovulation-enhancement drugs and timed intercourse might be usedfor the woman with ovulation problems. The womanshould understand the drug's benefits and side effectsbefore consenting to take them. Depending on the typeof drug used and the dosage, some women may experi-ence multiple births. If the woman's reproductive organsare damaged, surgery can be done to repair them. Stillother couples might opt for the hi-tech approaches of ar-ticial insemination (Fig. 4.2), in vitro fertilization (IVF;Fig. 4.3), and egg donation or contract for a gestationalCHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 7511223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 7576 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN carrier or surrogate (Grainger, Frazier & Rowland, 2006). Table 4.3 lists selected infertility options. Nursing Assessment Infertile couples are under tremendous pressure and often keep the problem a secret, considering it to be verypersonal. The couple is often beset by feelings of inade-quacy and guilt, and many are subject to pressures fromboth family and friends. As their problem becomes morechronic, they may begin to blame one another, with con-sequent marital discord. Seeking help is often a very dif-cult step for them, and it may take a lot of courage todiscuss something about which they feel deeply embar-rassed or upset. The nurse working in this specialty set-ting must be aware of the conflict and problems couplespresent with and must be very sensitive to their needs. A full medical history should be taken from both partners, along with a physical examination. The dataneeded for the infertility evaluation are very sensitive andof a personal nature, so the nurse must use very profes-sional interviewing skills.There are numerous causes of and contributing fac- tors to infertility, so it is important to use the process ofelimination, determining what problems don't exist tobetter comprehend the problems that do exist. At the rstvisit, a plan of investigation is outlined and a completehealth history is taken. This rst visit forces many cou-ples to confront the reality that their desired pregnancymay not occur naturally. Alleviate some of the anxiety as-sociated with diagnostic testing by explaining the timingand reasons for each test. Assessing Male Factors The initial screening evaluation for the male partnershould include a reproductive history and a semen analy-sis. From the male perspective, three things must happenfor conception to take place: there must be an adequatenumber of sperm; those sperm must be healthy and ma-ture; and the sperm must be able to penetrate and fertilize the egg. Normal males need to have more than 20 mil-lion sperm per milliliter with greater than 50% motility(WHO, 2007). Semen analysis is the most importantindicator of male fertility. The man should abstain from B AFIGURE4.2Articial insemination. Sperm are deposited next to the cervix ( A) or injected directly into the uterine cavity ( B).

Eggs or sperm are retrieved from a donor and the eggs are insemi-nated; resulting embryos aretransferred via IVF. Recommended for women older than 40 and those with poor-quality eggs. Laboratory fertilization takes place and embryos are transferred to theuterus of another woman, who willcarry the pregnancy. Medical-legal issues have resulted over the \"true ownership\" of theresulting infant.Nurse can advise the couple to have intercourse every other day for 1 week starting after day 5 of medication. Same as above Nurse needs to advise couple that the procedure might need to be repeated if not successful the rsttime. Nurse advises woman to take med- ication to stimulate ovulation sothe mature ovum can be retrievedby needle aspiration. Nurse needs to inform couple of risks and have consent signed. Nurse needs to inform the male that sperm will be aspirated by a needlethrough the skin into the epididymis. Nurse needs to support couple in their ethical/religious discussionsprior to deciding. Nurse should encourage an open dis- cussion regarding implications ofthis method with the couple. *When other options have been exhausted, these are considered. sexual activity for 24 to 48 hours before giving the sample. For a semen examination, the man is asked to producea specimen by ejaculating into a specimen containerand delivering it to the laboratory for analysis within 1 to2 hours. When the specimen is brought to the labora-tory, it is analyzed for volume, viscosity, number of sperm, sperm viability, motility, and sperm shape. If semen param-eters are normal, no further male evaluation is necessary (Quallich, 2006). The physical examination routinely includes: Assessment for appropriate male sexual characteristics, such as body hair distribution, development of theAdam's apple, and muscle developmentCHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 7711223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 7778 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Examination of the penis, scrotum, testicles, epididymis, and vas deferens for abnormalities (e.g., nodules, irregularities, varicocele) Assessment for normal development of external geni- talia (small testicles) Performance of a digital internal examination of the prostate to check for tenderness or swelling (DeMasters, 2004) Assessing Female Factors The initial assessment of the woman should include athorough history of factors associated with ovulationand the pelvic organs. Diagnostic tests to determine fe-male infertility may include: Assessment of ovarian function Menstrual history: regularity of cycles Ovulation predictor kits used midcycle Urinary LH level Clomiphene citrate challenge test Endometrial luteal phase Assessment of pelvic organs Papanicolaou (Pap) smear to rule out cervical cancer or inflammation Cervical culture to rule out Chlamydia infection Postcoital testing to evaluate sperm-cervical mucus interaction Ultrasound to assess pelvic structures Hysterosalpingography to visualize structural defects Laparoscopy to visualize pelvic structures and diag- nose endometriosis Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The diagnostic procedures that should be done during aninfertility workup should be guided by the couple's history.They generally proceed from less to more invasive tests. Home Ovulation Predictor Kits Home ovulation predictor kits contain monoclonal anti-bodies specic for LH and use the ELISA test to determinethe amount of LH present in the urine. A signicant colorchange from baseline indicates the LH surge and presum-ably the most fertile day of the month for the woman. Clomiphene Citrate Challenge Test The clomiphene citrate challenge test is used to assess awoman's ovarian reserve (ability of her eggs to become fer-tilized). FSH levels are drawn on cycle day 3 and on cycleday 10 after the woman has taken 100 mg clomiphenecitrate on cycle days 5 through 9. If the FSH level isgreater than 15, the result is considered abnormal and thelikelihood of conception with her own eggs is very low(Schuiling & Likis, 2006). Endometrial Biopsy Another assessment of ovulation that indicates whetherthe secretion of progesterone is adequate is an endometrialbiopsy. A strip of endometrial tissue is removed just before menstruation. Histologic documentation of secretory en-dometrial development implies that ovulation has takenplace. An endometrium that does not conform to the nor-mal histologic pattern indicates a defect in the luteal phase. Postcoital Testing Postcoital testing is done to assess the receptivity of thecervical mucus to sperm. Cervical mucus from the womanis examined 2 to 8 hours after intercourse during theexpected time of ovulation, and the number of live,motile sperm present is assessed. Cervical mucus is alsoevaluated for stretchability (spinnbarkeit) and consis-tency (Alexander et al., 2007). The results are describedin Comparison Chart 4.1. Hysterosalpingogram In a hysterosalpingogram, 3 to 10 mL of an opaque con-trast medium is slowly injected through a catheter intothe endocervical canal so that the uterus and tubes can bevisualized during fluoroscopy and radiography. If the fal-lopian tubes are patent, the dye will ascend upward todistend the uterus and the tubes and will spill out into theperitoneal cavity (Fig. 4.4). Laparoscopy A laparoscopy is usually performed early in the menstrualcycle. During the procedure, an endoscope is insertedthrough a small incision in the anterior abdominal wall.Visualization of the peritoneal cavity in an infertile womanmay reveal endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, tubal occlu-sion, broids, or polycystic ovaries (DeSutter, 2006). Nursing Management Nurses play an important role in the care of infertile cou-ples. They are pivotal educators about preventive healthcare. There are a number of potentially modiable risk Normal Normal amounts of sperm are seen in the sample. Sperm are moving for- ward through the cervical mucus. The mucus stretches at least 2 in (5 cm). The mucus dries in a fernlike pattern.Abnormal No sperm or a large percent- age of dead sperm areseen in the sample. Sperm are clumped. Mucus cannot stretch 2 in (5 cm). Mucus does not dry in a fernlike pattern.COMPARISON CHART 8/4/08 2:40 PM Page 78(continued)BOX 4.4 Organizations and Web Resources to Assist the Client With Infertility Resolve: A nationwide network of chapters dedicated to providing education, advocacy, and support for menand women facing infertility.

The nurse is most effective whenhe or she offers care and treatment in a professional man-ner and regards the couple as valued and respected indi-viduals. The nurse's focus must encompass the wholeperson, not just the results of the various infertility studies.Throughout the entire process, the nurse's role is to pro-vide information, anticipatory guidance, stress manage-ment, and counseling. The couple's emotional distress isusually very high, and the nurse must be able to recognizethat anxiety and provide emotional support. The nurse mayneed to refer couples to a reproductive endocrinologist orsurgeon, depending on the problem identied. There is no absolute way to prevent infertility per se because so many factors are involved in conception.Nurses can be instrumental in educating men and womenabout the factors that contribute to infertility. The nursecan also outline the risks and benets of treatments so thatthe couple can make an informed decision. With advances in genetics and reproductive medicine also come a myriad of ethical, social, and cultural issuesthat will affect the couple's decisions. With this in mind,provide an opportunity for the couple to make informeddecisions in a nondirective, nonjudgmental environment.It is important to encourage couples to remain optimisticthroughout investigation and treatment. Through the useof advocacy and anticipatory guidance, assist and supportcouples through the diagnosis and treatment of infertility(Jenkins & Jenkins, 2006). Finances and insurance coverage often dictate the choice of treatment. Help couples decipher their insur-ance coverage and help them weigh the costs of variousprocedures by explaining what each will provide in termsof information about their infertility problems. Assistingthem to make a priority list of diagnostic tests and poten-tial treatment options will help the couple plan their -nancial strategy. Many infertile couples are not prepared for the emo- tional roller coaster of grief and loss during infertilitytreatments. Financial concerns and coping as a couple aretwo major areas of stress when treatment is undertaken. During the course of what may be months or even yearsof infertility care, it is essential to develop a holistic ap-proach to nursing care. Stress management and anxietyreduction need to be addressed, and referral to a peer sup-port group such as Resolve might be in order (Box 4.4). Consider THIS! We had been married for 3 years and wanted to start a family, but much to our dismay nothing happenedafter a year of trying. I had some irregular periods andwas nally diagnosed with endometriosis and put onClomid. After 3 years of taking Clomid on and off, I went to a fertility expert. The doctor lasered the endometriosis tissue, sent air through my tubes to makesure they were patent, and put me back on Clomid,but still with no luck. Finally, 2 years later, we wereput on an IVF waiting list and prayed we would havethe money for the procedure when we were chosen. Bythen I felt a failure as a woman. We then decided thatit was more important for us to be parents than it wasfor me to be pregnant, so we considered adoption. Wetried for another year without any results. We went to the adoption agency to ll out the paperwork for the process to begin. Our blood was FIGURE4.4Insertion of a dye for a hystero- salpingogram.

Table 4.4 provides a detailed summary of each type, including infor-mation on failure rates, advantages, disadvantages, STIprotection, and danger signs. Types of Contraceptive Methods Contraceptives methods can be divided into three types: behavioral methods, barrier methods, and hormonalmethods. Behavioral Methods Behavioral methods refer to any natural contraceptivemethod that does not require hormones, pharmaceuticalcompounds, physical barriers, or surgery to prevent preg-nancy. These methods require couples to take an active rolein preventing pregnancy through their sexual behaviors. Abstinence Abstinence (not having vaginal or anal intercourse) is one of the least expensive forms of contraception and hasbeen used for thousands of years. Basically, pregnancycannot occur if sperm is kept out of the vagina. It also re-duces the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and other STIs,unless body fluids are exchanged through oral sex; how-ever, some infections, like herpes and HPV, can be passedby skin-to-skin contact. There are many pleasurableBOX 4.5 Outline of Contraceptive Methods Reversible Methods Behavioral Abstinence Fertility awareness Withdrawal (coitus interruptus) Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) Barrier Condom (male and female) Diaphragm Cervical cap Sponge Hormonal Oral contraceptives Injectable contraceptive Transdermal patches Vaginal ring Implantable contraceptives Intrauterine systems Emergency contraceptives Permanent Methods Tubal ligation for women Vasectomy for mentaken and we waited for an hour, wondering the whole time why it was taking so long for the results.

Infertility can affect self-esteem, disrupt relationships, and result in depression. This couple experienced many years of frustration intrying to have a family. What help can be offered tocouples during this time? What can be said to comfortthe woman who feels she is a failure? Contraception In the United States, there are approximately 62 millionwomen in their childbearing years, ages 15 to 44. Over-all, 64% of those 60 million women use contraception,but still more than 3 million unintended pregnanciesoccur every year (CDC, 2006). Although numerous fer-tility control methods are available, the United Statescontinues to have a higher unintended pregnancy ratethan other Western countries. Every minute of every day,10 people become infected with HIV, most through hetero-sexual contact; 190 women conceive an unwanted preg- nancy; 1 woman dies from a pregnancy-related cause; and40 women undergo unsafe abortions, as outlined in theUNFPA State of the World Population 2006 Report.Much of this suffering could be prevented by access to safe, efcient, appropriate, modern contraception for everyonewho wants it (UNFPA, 2007). Contraception is any method that prevents con- ception or childbirth. A woman's reproductive life spansalmost 40 years, and throughout those years, a variety ofcontraceptive methods may be used. Oral contracep-tives, sterilization of the female, and the male condomare the most popular methods in the United States (AlanGuttmacher Institute, 2007). Couples must decide which method is appropriate for them to meet their changing contraceptive needs through-out their life cycles. Nurses can educate and assist couplesduring this selection process. This part of the chapter willoutline the most common birth control methods available. In an era when many women wish to delay pregnancy and avoid STIs, choices are difcult. There are numer-ous methods available today, and many more will be of-fered in the near future. The ideal contraceptive methodfor many women would have to have the following char-acteristics: ease of use, safety, effectiveness, minimal sideeffects, \"naturalness,\" nonhormonal method, and imme-diate reversibility (Samra & Wood, 2006). Currently, noone contraceptive method offers everything. Box 4.5 out-Consider THIS!

Many people have strong feelings about abstinence based on religious and moral beliefs. There are many goodand personal reasons to choose abstinence. For some it isa way of life, while for others it is a temporary choice. Somepeople choose abstinence because they want to: Wait until they are older Wait for a long-term relationship Avoid pregnancy or STIs Follow religious or cultural expectations Fertility Awareness Fertility awareness is a natural method of contraception in which no contraceptive devices are used; instead, cer-tain observations, techniques, and calculations are used todetermine the \"fertile\" and the \"safe\" periods in a monthlymenstrual cycle. There are normal physiologic changescaused by hormonal fluctuations during the menstrualcycle that can be observed and charted. This informationcan be used to avoid or promote pregnancy. Fertilityawareness methods rely upon the following assumptions: A single ovum is released from the ovary 14 days before the next menstrual period. It lives approximately24 hours. Sperm can live up to 5 days after intercourse. The \"unsafe period\" during the menstrual cycle is thus approximately 6 days: 3 days before and 3 days afterovulation. Since bodily changes start to occur beforeovulation, the woman can become aware of them andnot have intercourse on these days or use anothermethod to prevent pregnancy. The exact time of ovulation cannot be determined, so 2 to 3 days are added to the beginning and end toavoid pregnancy. Techniques used to determine fertility include the cer- vical mucus ovulation method, the basal body temperature(BBT) method, and the symptothermal method (Hatcheret al., 2004). Fertility awareness methods are moderatelyeffective but are very unforgiving if not carried out as pre-scribed: not following the guidelines might cause a 27%failure or pregnancy rate per cycle (Murphy, Morgan &Likis, 2006). Fertility awareness can be used in combina-tion with coital abstinence or barrier methods during fer-tile days if pregnancy is not desired. Cervical Mucus Ovulation Method The cervical mucus ovulation method is used to assess the character of the cervical mucus. Cervical mucuschanges in consistency during the menstrual cycle andplays a vital role in fertilization of the egg. In the days pre-ceding ovulation, fertile cervical mucus helps draw spermup and into the fallopian tubes, where fertilization usuallytakes place. It also helps maintain the survival of sperm.As ovulation approaches, the mucus becomes more abun- dant, clear, slippery, and smooth; it can be stretched be-tween two ngers without breaking. Under the influenceof estrogen, this mucus looks like egg whites. It is calledspinnbarkeit mucus (Fig. 4.5). After ovulation, the cervi-cal mucus becomes thick and dry under the influence ofprogesterone. The cervical position can also be assessed to conrm changes in the cervical mucus at ovulation. Near ovula-tion, the cervix feels soft and is high/deep in the vagina,the os is slightly open, and the cervical mucus is copiousand slippery (Hatcher et al., 2004). This method works because the woman becomes aware of her body changes that accompany ovulation.When she notices them, she abstains from sexual inter-course or uses another method to prevent pregnancy.Each woman is an individual, so each woman's unsafetime of the month is unique and thus must be individu-ally assessed and determined. Basal Body Temperature The basal body temperature (BBT) refers to the low- est temperature reached upon wakening. The womantakes her temperature orally before rising and records iton a chart. Preovulation temperatures are suppressedby estrogen, whereas postovulation temperatures areincreased under the influence of heat-inducing proges-terone. Temperatures typically rise within a day or twoafter ovulation and remain elevated for approximately2 weeks (at which point bleeding usually begins). If usingthis method by itself, the woman should avoid unprotectedintercourse until the BBT has been elevated for 3 days.Other fertility awareness methods should be used alongwith BBT for better results (Fig. 4.6). FIGURE4.5Spinnbarkeit is the ability of cervical mucus to stretch a distance before breaking.11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 86CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 87 Symptothermal Method The symptothermal method relies on a combination of techniques to recognize ovulation, including BBT, cer-vical mucus changes, alterations in the position and rm-ness of the cervix, and other symptoms of ovulation, suchas increased libido, mittelschmerz, pelvic fullness or ten-derness, and breast tenderness (Dirubbo, 2006). Com-bining all these predictors increases awareness of whenovulation occurs and increases the effectiveness of thismethod. A home predictor test for ovulation is also avail-able in most pharmacies. It measures LH levels to pin-point the day before or the day of ovulation. These testsare widely used for fertility and infertility regimens. The Standard Days Method and the Two-Day Method The Standard Days Method (SDM) and the Two-Day Method are both natural methods of contraception de-veloped by Georgetown University Medical Center's In-stitute for Reproductive Health. Both methods providewomen with simple, clear instructions for identifying fer-tile days. Women with menstrual cycles between 26 and32 days long can use the SDM to prevent pregnancy byavoiding unprotected intercourse on days 8 through 19of their cycles. An international clinical trial of the SDMshowed that the method is more than 95% effective whenused correctly (Sinai, Arevalo & Jennings, 12-day \"fertile window\" of a woman's men-strual cycle. These 12 days takes into account the life-span of the women's egg (about 24 hours) and the viabilityof the sperm (about 5 days) as well as the variation in theactual timing of ovulation from one cycle to another. Forthe Two-Day Method, women observe the presence orabsence of cervical secretions by examining toilet paperor underwear or by monitoring their physical sensations.Every day, the woman asks two simple questions \"Did Inote any secretions yesterday?\" and \"Did I note any se-cretions today?\" If the answer to either question is yes,she considers herself fertile and avoids unprotected inter-course. If the answers are no, she is unlikely to becomepregnant from unprotected intercourse on that day (Sinai, Arevalo & Jennings, 2006). To help women keep track of the days on which they should avoid unprotected intercourse, a string of 32 color-coded beads (CycleBeads) is used, with each bead rep-resenting a day of the menstrual cycle. Starting with thered bead, which represents the rst day of her menstrualperiod, the woman moves a small rubber ring one beadeach day. The brown beads are the days when pregnancyis unlikely, and the white beads represent her fertile days(Arevalo, 2007). This method has been used in under-developed countries for women with limited educationalresources (Fig. 4.7). Withdrawal (Coitus Interruptus) In coitus interruptus , also known as withdrawal, a man controls his ejaculation during sexual intercourse and ejac-ulates outside the vagina.

Theproblem with this method is that the rst few drops of thetrue ejaculate contain the greatest concentration of sperm,and if some pre-ejaculatory fluid escapes from the urethrabefore orgasm, conception may result. This method re-quires that the woman rely solely on the cooperation andjudgment of the man. Lactational Amenorrhea Method The lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) is an ef- fective temporary method of contraception used by breast-feeding mothers. Continuous breastfeeding can postponeovulation and thus prevent pregnancy. Breastfeeding stim-ulates the hormone prolactin, which is necessary for milkproduction, and also inhibits the release of another hor-mone, gonadotropin, which is necessary for ovulation. Breastfeeding as a contraceptive method can be effec- tive for 6 months after delivery only if a woman: Has not had a period since she gave birth Breastfeeds her baby at least six times daily on both breasts Breastfeeds her baby \"on demand\" at least every 4 hours Does not substitute other foods for a breast-milk meal Provides nighttime feedings at least every 6 hours Does not rely on this method after 6 months (Planned Parenthood, 2007) Barrier Methods Barrier contraceptives are forms of birth control that pre- vent pregnancy by preventing the sperm from reaching theovum. Mechanical barriers include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and sponges. These devices are placed overthe penis or cervix to physically obstruct the passage ofsperm through the cervix. Chemical barriers called spermi-cides may be used along with mechanical barrier devices.They come in creams, jellies, foam, suppositories, and vagi-nal lms. They chemically destroy the sperm in the vagina.These contraceptives are called barrier methods becausethey not only provide a physical barrier for sperm, butalso protect against STIs. Since the HIV/AIDS epidemicstarted in the early 1980s, these methods have becomeextremely popular. Many of these barrier methods contain latex. Allergy to latex was rst recognized in the late 1970s, and sincethen it has become a major health concern, with increasingnumbers of people affected. According to the AmericanAcademy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (2007), 6%of the general population, 10% of health care workers, and50% of spina bida patients are sensitive to natural rub-ber latex. Since the late 1980s, with the establishment ofpolicies dictating barrier requirements resulting from theHIV/AIDS epidemic, there has been an exponential in-crease in the use of latex gloves and condoms (Lenehan,2004). Teaching Guidelines 4.4 provides tips for individ-uals with latex allergy. The RED bead marks the first day of your menstrual period. On the day your period starts, move the ring to the red bead. Continue to move the ring one bead each day. All WHITE beads mark the days when you are likely to get pregnant. Do not have unprotected sex on the white bead days if you do not want to get pregnant. All BROWN beads mark the days when you are not likely to get pregnant if you have unprotected sex. The DARK BROWN bead helps you know if your cycle is less than 26 days long. If your period starts before you move the ring to the dark brown bead, your cycle is shorter than 26 days. If your period does not start by the day after you move the ring to the last BROWN bead, your cycle is longer than 32 days. FIGURE4.7CycleBeads help women use the Standard Days Method. TEACHING GUIDELINES 4.4 Tips for Individuals Allergic to Latex Symptoms of latex allergy include: Skin rash, itching, hives Itching or burning eyes Swollen mucous membranes in the genitals Shortness of breath, difculty breathing, wheezing Anaphylactic shock (OSHA, 2006) Use of or contact with latex condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms is contraindicated for men andwomen with a latex allergy. If the female partner is allergic to latex, have the male partner apply a natural condom over the latex one. If the male partner experiences penile irritation after condom use, try different brands or place the latexcondom over a natural condom. Use polyurethane condoms rather than latex ones. Use female condoms; they are made of polyurethane. Switch to another birth control method that isn't made with latex, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine systems, Depo-Provera, fertility awareness, and other non-barrier methods. However, these methods do not protect againstsexually transmitted infections.11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 88CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 89 Condoms Condoms are barrier methods of contraceptives made for both males and females. The male condom is madefrom latex or polyurethane or natural membrane and maybe coated with spermicide. Male condoms are availablein many colors, textures, sizes, shapes, and thicknesses.When used correctly, the male condom is put on overan erect penis before it enters the vagina and is wornthroughout sexual intercourse (Fig. 4.8). It serves as abarrier to pregnancy by trapping seminal fluid and spermand offers protection against STIs. Condoms are not per-fect barriers, though, because breakage and slippage canoccur. In addition, the non-latex condoms have a higherrisk of pregnancy and STIs than latex condoms (Gallo,Grimes, Lopez & Schultz, 2006). The female condom is a polyurethane pouch inserted into the vagina. It consists of an outer and inner ring thatis inserted vaginally and held in place by the pubic bone. Some women complain that the female condom is cum-bersome to use and makes noise during intercourse. Fe-male condoms are readily available, are inexpensive, andcan be carried inconspicuously by the woman. The femalecondom was the first woman-controlled method thatoffered protection against pregnancy and some STIs. Diaphragm The diaphragm is a soft latex dome surrounded by a metal spring. Used in conjunction with a spermicidaljelly or cream, it is inserted into the vagina to cover thecervix (Fig. 4.9). The diaphragm may be inserted up to4 hours before intercourse but must be left in place forat least 6 hours afterwards. Diaphragms are available ina range of sizes and styles. The diaphragm is availableonly by prescription and must be professionally tted by A B C Inner ring Outer ring D FIGURE4.8(A) Male condom. ( B) Applying a male condom.

Women may need to be retted with a different-sized diaphragm after pregnancy, abdomi-nal or pelvic surgery, or weight loss or gain of 10 pounds ormore. As a general rule, diaphragms should be replacedevery 1 to 2 years (Female Contraception, 2006). Thewoman also needs to receive thorough instruction about itsuse and should practice putting it in and taking it out be-fore she leaves the medical ofce (Fig. 4.10). Diaphragmsare user-controlled, nonhormonal methods that are neededonly at the time of intercourse, but they are not effective un-less used correctly. Cervical Cap The cervical cap is smaller than the diaphragm and cov- ers only the cervix; it is held in place by suction. Caps aremade from silicone or latex and are used with spermicide(Fig. 4.11). The Prentif cap and the FemCap are the onlycervical cap devices approved in the United States cur-rently (Gallo, Grimes & Schultz, 2006). The cap may beinserted up to 12 hours before intercourse and providesprotection for 48 hours. The cap must be kept in thevagina for 8 hours after the nal act of intercourse andshould be replaced every 1 to 2 years. A refitting mayalso be necessary when a women experiences pregnancy, abortion, or weight changes. The dome of the cap is lledabout one-third full with spermicide. Spermicide should FIGURE4.9Sample diaphragm used for measuring. BA diaphragm Positioning the diaphragm Removing the diaphragm FIGURE4.10 Application of a diaphragm.

The cap isavailable only by prescription and must be tted by ahealth care professional. Contraceptive Sponge The contraceptive sponge is a nonhormonal, non- prescription device that includes both a barrier and a sper-micide. When it was removed from the market in 1995, itwas the most popular over-the-counter female contracep-tive in America (Brucker, 2006). The manufacturer,Wyeth, stopped making the sponge rather than upgradeits manufacturing plant after the FDA found deciencies,but the device's effectiveness and safety were never ques-tioned. After receiving re-approval from the FDA in 2005,the contraceptive sponge is once again being marketed towomen. The contraceptive sponge is a soft polyurethane con- cave device that prevents pregnancy by covering the cervixand releasing spermicide. While it was less effective thanseveral other methods and does not offer protectionagainst STIs, the sponge achieved a wide following among women who appreciated the spontaneity with which itcould be used and its easy availability. To use the sponge,the woman rst wets it with water, then inserts it into thevagina with a nger, using a cord loop attachment. It canbe inserted up to 24 hours before intercourse and shouldbe left in place for at least 6 hours following intercourse.The sponge provides protection for up to 12 hours, butshould not be left in for more than 30 hours after inser-tion to avoid the risk of toxic shock syndrome (Brucker,2006). The sponge is a contraceptive method but doesnot protect against STIs.Hormonal Methods Several options are available to women who want long-term but not permanent protection against pregnancy.These methods of contraception work by altering thehormones within a woman's body. They rely on estrogenand progestin or progestin alone to prevent ovulation.When used consistently, these methods are a most reli-able way to prevent pregnancy. Hormonal methods includeoral contraceptives, injectables, implants, vaginal rings, and transdermal patches. Oral Contraceptives As early as 1937, scientists recognized that the injectionof progesterone inhibited ovulation in rabbits and pro-vided contraception. Breakthrough bleeding was reportedin early clinical trials in women, and the role of estrogenin cycle control was launched. This established the ratio-nale for modern combination oral contraceptives (OCs) that contain both estrogen and progesterone (Roederer,Blackwell & Blenning, 2006). In 1960 the FDA approvedthe rst combination OC, Enovid-10 (150 mcg estrogenand 9 mg progesterone), for use in the United States.Today, nearly 50 combination OCs are available in theUnited States. The most notable change in over 40 yearsof OC improvement has been the lowering of the estro-gen dose to as low as 20 mcg and the introduction of newprogestins. Oral contraceptives are the most popular method of nonsurgical contraception, used by approximately18 million women in the United States (Dirubbo, 2006)(Fig. 4.12). Unlike the original OCs that women tookdecades ago, the new low-dose forms carry fewer healthrisks. OCs, while most commonly prescribed for contracep- tion, have long been used in the management of a wide range of conditions and have many health benets, such as: Reduced incidence of ovarian and endometrial cancer Prevention and treatment of endometriosis Decreased incidence of acne and hirsutism FIGURE4.11 A cervical cap is placed over the cervix and usedwith a spermicidal jelly, thesame as PM Page 9192 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Decreased incidence of ectopic pregnancy Decreased incidence of acute PID Reduced incidence of brocystic breast disease Decreased perimenopausal symptoms Increased menstrual cycle regularity Lower incidence of colorectal cancer Reduced iron-deciency anemia by treating menorrhagia Reduced incidence of dysmenorrhea (Roederer, Blackwell & Blenning, 2006) OCs work primarily by suppressing ovulation by adding estrogen and progesterone to a woman's body, thus mimicking pregnancy. This hormonal level stiflesgonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turnsuppresses FSH and LH and inhibits ovulation.Cervical mucus also thickens, which hinders sperm trans-port into the uterus. Implantation is inhibited by suppres-sion of the maturation of the endometrium and alterationsof uterine secretions (Trussell, 2004). The combination pills are prescribed as monophasic pills, which deliver xed dosages of estrogen and progestin,or as multiphasic ones. Multiphasic pills (e.g., biphasicand triphasic OCs) alter the amount of progestin and es-trogen within each cycle. To maintain adequate hormonal levels for contraception and enhance compliance, OCsshould be taken at the same time daily. OCs that contain progestin only are called minipills. They are prescribed for women who cannot take estro-gen.They work primarily by thickening the cervical mucus to prevent penetration of the sperm and make the en-dometrium unfavorable for implantation. Progestin-only pills must be taken at a certain time every 24 hours. Break- through bleeding and a higher risk of pregnancy have madethese OCs less popular than combination OCs (Mishellet al., 2007). Extended OC regimens have been used for the man- agement of menstrual disorders and endometriosis foryears but now are attracting wider attention. Surveys ask-ing women about their willingness to reduce their men-strual cycles from 12 to 4 annually were returned with a resounding \"yes!\" (Archer, 2006). Recent studies con-rm that the extended use of active OC pills carries thesame safety prole as the conventional 28-day regimens(Anderson et al., 2006; Edelman et al., 2006; Grimes,2006). The extended regimen consists of 84 consecutivedays of active combination pills, followed by 7 days ofplacebo. The woman has four withdrawal-bleeding episodes a year. Seasonale, a combination OC, is on themarket for women who choose to reduce the number ofperiods that they have. There is no physiologic require-ment for cyclic hormonal withdrawal bleeds while taking OCs (Wysocki, 2007). The balance between the benets and the risks of OCs must be determined for each woman when she isbeing assessed for this type of contraceptive. It is a highlyeffective contraceptive when taken properly but can ag-gravate many medical conditions, especially in women who smoke. Comparison Chart 4.2 lists advantages anddisadvantages of OCs. A thorough history and pelvic ex-amination, including a Pap smear, must be completedbefore the medication is prescribed and yearly thereafter.Women should also be counseled that the effectiveness ofOCs is decreased when the woman is taking antibiotics;thus, the woman will need to use an alternative or sec-ondary method during this period to prevent pregnancy. Nurses need to provide OC users with a great deal of education before they leave the health care facility. Theyneed to be able to identify early signs and symptoms thatmight indicate a problem.

Transdermal Patches A transdermal patch , Ortho Evra, is also available. It is a matchbox-sized patch containing hormones that areabsorbed through the skin when placed on the lowerabdomen, upper outer arm, buttocks, or upper torso(avoiding the breasts). The patch is applied weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a patch-free week during whichwithdrawal bleeding occurs. The patch delivers continu-ous levels of progesterone and estrogen. Transdermal ab-sorption allows the drug to enter the bloodstream directly,avoiding rapid inactivation in the liver known as rst-passmetabolism. Since estrogen and progesterone are metab-olized by liver enzymes, avoiding rst-pass metabolismwas thought to reduce adverse effects. However, recentevidence suggests that the risk of venous thrombosis andembolism is increased with the patch (Courtney, 2006).Additional studies are underway to understand the clin-ical significance of these latest findings, but in the in-terim nurses need to focus on ongoing risk assessmentand should be prepared to discuss current research find-ings with clients. Compliance with combination contraceptive patch use has been shown to be signicantly greater than com-pliance with OCs (Graziottin, 2006). The patch providescombination hormone therapy with a side effect prolesimilar to that of OCs. The manufacturer is currently eval-uating extended regimens for the patch (Stewart et al.,2006) (Fig. 4.14). Vaginal Rings The contraceptive vaginal ring , NuvaRing, is a flexible, soft, transparent ring that is inserted by the user for a3-week period of continuous use followed by a ring-freeweek to allow withdrawal bleeding (Fig. 4.15). The ringcan be inserted by the woman and does not have to beBOX 4.6 Early Signs of Complications for OC Users A: Abdominal pain may indicate liver or gallbladder problems.

It is administered once every 28 to 33 days by intramuscular injection. It provides immediate,very effective contraception if given within 5 days afterthe last normal menses. Its mechanism of action, contra- indications, and side effects are similar to those of OCs(Murphy, Morgan & Likis, 2006). Depo-Provera is the trade name for an injectable form of a progesterone-only contraceptive given every12 weeks. Depo-Provera works by suppressing ovulationand the production of FSH and LH by the pituitary increasing the viscosity of cervical mucus and causingendometrial atrophy. A single injection of 150 mg intothe buttocks acts like other progestin-only products toprevent pregnancy for 3 months at a time (Fig. 4.13). Theprimary side effect of Depo Provera is menstrual cycledisturbance. Recent clinical studies have raised concerns about whether Depo-Provera reduces bone mineral density.This evidence has prompted the manufacturer and theFDA to issue a warning about the long-term use of Depo-Provera and bone loss (Robinson, 2005). It is not entirely11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 9394 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN both insertion and removal. The implants don't offer any protection against STIs. Intrauterine Systems Intrauterine systems are small plastic T-shaped objectsthat are placed inside the uterus to provide contraception(Fig. 4.16). They prevent pregnancy by making the en-dometrium of the uterus hostile to implantation of a fertil- ized ovum by causing a nonspecic inflammatory reaction(Hearton, 2006). Monthly periods become lighter, shorter,and less painful, making this a useful method for womenwith heavy, painful periods. Some implants may containcopper or progesterone to enhance their effectiveness. One or two attached strings protrude into the vagina so that theuser can check for placement. Currently there are three intrauterine systems avail- able in the United States: the copper ParaGard-T-380A;Progestasert, a progesterone device; and the levonorgestrelintrauterine system (LNG-IUS) Mirena, a levonorgestrel-releasing device. The ParaGard-T-380A is approved for10 years of use. The Progestasert may stay in place 1 year,then must be removed and replaced. Mirena providesintrauterine conception for up to 5 years. An advantageof these hormonally impregnated intrauterine systemsis that they are relatively maintenance-free: users mustconsciously discontinue using them to become pregnantrather than making a daily decision to avoid conception(French et al., 2006). Box 4.7 highlights warning signs ofcomplications. Emergency Contraception Unplanned pregnancy is a major health, economic, andsocial issue for women. Approximately half of all un-planned pregnancies end in abortion (CDC, 2006).Emergency contraception (EC) reduces the risk of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or contraceptivefailure such as condom breakage (Lever, 2005). It is usedwithin 72 hours of unprotected intercourse to preventpregnancy. The sooner ECs are taken, the more effective FIGURE4.15 Vaginal ring. FIGURE4.16 (A) Intrauterine system.

The woman compresses the ring and inserts it into the vagina, behind the pubic bone, as far back as possible,but precise placement is not critical. The hormones areabsorbed through the vaginal mucosa. It is left in place for3 weeks and then removed and discarded. Effectivenessand adverse events are similar to those seen with combi-nation OCs. Clients need to be counseled regarding timely insertion of the ring and what to do in case of accidentalexpulsion. This device is also being tested for extendedregimens to reduce menstrual bleeding. Implantable Contraceptives The implant is a subdermal time-release method that delivers synthetic progestin. Once in place, it delivers sev-eral years of continuous, highly effective contraception.Like progestin-only pills, implants act by inhibiting ovula-tion and thickening cervical mucus so sperm cannot pen-etrate. A single-rod progestin implant (Implanon) receivedFDA approval in 2006 (Tolaymat & Kaunitz, 2007). The side effects are also similar to progestin-only pills: irreg- ularbleeding, headaches, weight gain, breast tenderness, and depression. Fertility is restored quickly after it is re-moved. Implants require a minor surgical procedure for11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 94CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 95 Contrary to popular belief, ECs do not induce abor- tion and are not related to mifepristone or RU-486, theso-called abortion pill approved by the FDA in 2000.Mifepristone chemically induces abortion by blocking thebody's progesterone receptors, which are necessary forpregnancy maintenance. ECs simply prevent embryo cre-ation and uterine implantation from occurring in the rstplace. There is no evidence that ECs have any effect onan already-implanted ovum. The side effects are nauseaand vomiting. Sterilization Sterilization is an attractive method of contraception forthose who are certain they do not want any, or any more,children. Sterilization refers to surgical procedures in- tended to render the person infertile. It is one of the mostpopular methods of contraception in the United Statesand worldwide (Swica & Westhoff, 2006). More womenthan men undergo surgical sterilization. According to theBOX 4.7 Warnings for Intrauterine System Users of Potential Complications P: Period late, pregnancy, abnormal spotting or bleeding A: Abdominal pain, pain with intercourse I: Infection exposure, abnormal vaginal discharge N: Not feeling well, fever, chills S: String length shorter or longer or missing Source: Hatcher et al., 2004.

They reduce the risk of pregnancy for a single act of unprotected sex by almost 80% (Cheng et al.,2006). The methods available in the United States areprogestin-only OCs, combination OCs, EC kit (Plan B)(Fig. 4.17), or insertion of a copper-releasing intrauter-ine system up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse(Lever, 2005). The FDA recently approved Plan B (levo-norgestrel) to be sold over the counter to women aged 18and older; it is still available by prescription to womenyounger than 18 years (U.S. Food & Drug Administra-tion, 2006). Table 4.5 lists recommended oral medica-tion and intrauterine regimens. Prime points to stress concerning ECs are: ECs do not offer any protection against STIs or future pregnancies. ECs should not be used in place of regular birth con- trol, as they are less effective. ECs are regular birth control pills given at higher doses and more frequently. ECs are contraindicated during pregnancy because they are considered to be teratogenic Site of vasectomy incisions. (B) The vas deferens is cut with surgical scissors.

CDC, approximately 18% of women undergo female sterilization in comparison to 7% of men in the UnitedStates (CDC, 2006). Sterilization should be considereda permanent end to fertility because reversal surgery isdifcult, expensive, and not highly successful. Tubal Ligation Tubal ligation , the sterilization procedure for women, can be performed postpartum, after an abortion, or as aninterval procedure unrelated to pregnancy. A laparoscopeis inserted through a small subumbilical incision to providea view of the fallopian tubes. They are grasped and sealedwith a cauterizing instrument or with rings, bands, or clipsor cut and tied (Fig. 4.18). A new approach used to visualize the fallopian tubes is through the cervix instead of the abdominal incision.This procedure, called transcervical sterilization, offersseveral advantages over conventional tubal ligation: gen-eral anesthesia and incisions are not needed, thereby in-creasing safety, lowering costs, and improving access tosterilization. A tiny coil (Essure) is introduced and re-leased into the fallopian tubes through the cervix. Thecoil promotes tissue growth in the fallopian tubes, andover a period of 3 months, this growth blocks the tubes(Valle, 2006). This less-invasive technique has becomeincreasingly popular. Vasectomy Male sterilization is accomplished with a surgical procedureknown as a vasectomy . It is usually performed under local anesthesia in an urologist's ofce, and most men can returnto work and normal activities in a day or two. The proce-dure involves making a small incision into the scrotumand cutting the vas deferens, which carries sperm from thetestes to the penis (Fig. 4.19). After vasectomy, semen nolonger contains sperm. This is not immediate, though, andthe man must submit semen specimens for analysis untiltwo specimens show that no sperm is present. When thespecimen shows azoospermia, the man's sterility is thenconrmed (Dassow & Bennett, 2006).Nursing Management of the Woman Choosing a Contraceptive Method The choice of a contraceptive method is a very personal one involving many factors. What makes a woman chooseone contraceptive method over another? In making con-traceptive choices, couples must balance their sexual11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 96CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 97 ceptive method that is efcacious and ts her preferences and lifestyle. Nursing Assessment When assessing which contraceptive method might meetthe client's needs, the nurse might ask: Do your religious beliefs interfere with any methods? Will this method interfere with your sexual pleasure? Are you aware of the various methods currently available? Is cost a major consideration, or does your insurance cover it? Does your partner influence which method you choose? Have you heard anything troubling about any of the methods? How comfortable are you touching your own body? What are your future plans for having children? Although deciding on a contraceptive is a very per- sonal decision between a woman and her partner, nursescan assist in this process by performing a complete healthhistory and physical examination, and by educating thewoman and her partner about necessary laboratory anddiagnostic testing. Areas of focus during the nursing as-sessment are as follows: Medical history: smoking status, cancer of reproductive tract, diabetes mellitus, migraines, hypertension,thromboembolic disorder, allergies, risk factors forcardiovascular disease Family history: cancer, cardiovascular disease, hyper- tension, stroke, diabetes OB/GYN history: menstrual disorders, current contraceptive, previous STIs, PID, vaginitis, sexualactivity Personal history: use of tampons and female hygiene products, plans for childbearing, comfort with touchingherself, number of sexual partners and their involvementin the decision Physical examination: height, weight, blood pres- sure, breast examination, thyroid palpation, pelvicexamination Diagnostic testing: urinalysis, complete blood count, Pap smear, wet mount to check for STIs, HIV/AIDStests, lipid prole, glucose level Figure 4.20 shows an example of a family planning flow record that can be used during the assessment. Aftercollecting the assessment data above, consider the med-ical factors to help decide if she is a candidate for allmethods or whether some should be eliminated. For ex-ample, if she reports she has multiple sex partners and hasa lengthy history of various pelvic infections, she wouldnot be a good candidate for an intrauterine system, basedon her infection history.

The search for a choice that satises all threeobjectives is challenging. A method that works for a sex-ually active teenage girl may not meet her needs later inlife. Several considerations influence a person's choice ofcontraceptives: Motivation Cost Cultural and religious beliefs (Box 4.8) Convenience Effectiveness Side effects Desire for children in the future Safety of the method Comfort level with sexuality Protection from STIs Interference with spontaneity If a contraceptive is to be effective, the woman must understand how it works, must be able to use it correctlyand consistently, and must be comfortable and confi-dent with it. If a patient cannot comply with taking a pilldaily, consider a method used once a week (transdermalpatches), once every 3 weeks (transvaginal ring), or once every 3 months (Depo-Provera injection). Another optionmay be a progesterone intrauterine device that lasts 3 to5 years and reduces menstrual flow signicantly. Regardless of which method is chosen, the client's needs should be paramount in the discussion. The nursecan educate clients about which methods are availableand their advantages and disadvantages, efcacy, cost, andsafety.

Nursing Diagnoses A few nursing diagnoses that might be appropriate basedon the nurse's assessment during the decision-makingprocess include: Decient knowledge related to: Methods available Side effects/safety Correct use of method chosen Previous myths believed Risk for infection related to: Unprotected sexual intercourse Past history of STIs Methods offering protection Nursing diagnoses applicable to the contraceptive would be: Health-seeking behaviors related to: Perceived need for limiting number of children Overall health relative to contraceptives Risk for ineffective health maintenance related to: Not being familiar with the various contraceptive methods Being unaware of high-risk sexual behavior leading to STIs Fear related to: Not understanding the correct procedure to use Unintended pregnancy occurring if not used correctly General health concerning the long-term side effects Nursing Interventions Contraception is an important issue for all couples, andthe method used should be decided by the woman andher partner jointly. Facilitate this process by establishinga trusting relationship with the client and by providingunbiased, accurate information about all methods avail-able. As a nurse, reflect honestly on your feelings towardscontraceptives while allowing the client's feelings to becentral. Be aware of the practical issues involved in con-traceptive use, and avoid making assumptions, makingdecisions on the woman's behalf, and making judgmentsabout her and her situation. To do so, it is important tokeep up to date on the latest methods available and con-vey this information to clients. Encourage female clientsto take control of their lives by sharing information thatallows them to plan their futures. The following guidelines are helpful in counseling and educating the client or couple about contraceptives: Encourage the client/couple to participate in choosing a method. Provide client education. The client/couple must be informed users before the method is agreed upon. Education should be targeted to the client's level so itis understood. Provide step-by-step teaching and an opportunity for practice for certain methods (cervicalcaps, diaphragms, vaginal rings, and condoms). SeeTeaching Guidelines 4.5 and Figure 4.21. Obtain written informed consents, which are needed for intrauterine systems, implants, abortion, or steriliza-tion. Informed consent implies that the client is makinga knowledgeable, voluntary choice; has received com-plete information about the method, including the risks;and is free to change her mind before using the methodor having the procedure (Youngkin & Davis, 2004). Discuss contraindications for all selected contraceptives. Consider the client's cultural and religious beliefs when providing care. Address myths and misperceptions about the methods under consideration in your initial discussion of contraceptives. It is also important to clear up common misconcep- tions about contraception and pregnancy. Clearing upmisconceptions will permit new learning to take hold anda better client response to whichever methods are exploredand ultimately selected. Some common misconceptionsinclude: Breastfeeding protects against pregnancy. Pregnancy can be avoided if the male partner \"pulls out\" before he ejaculates. Pregnancy can't occur during menses. Douching after sex will prevent pregnancy. Pregnancy won't happen during the first sexual experience. Taking birth control pills protects against STIs. The woman is too old to get pregnant. Irregular menstruation prevents pregnancy. When discussing in detail each method of birth con- trol, focus on specic information for each method out-lined. Include information such as how this particularmethod works to prevent pregnancy under normal cir-cumstances of use; the noncontraceptive benets to over-all health; advantages and disadvantages of all methods;the cost involved for each particular method; dangersigns that need to be reported to the health care provider;and the required frequency of ofce visits needed for theparticular method. In addition, outline factors that place the client at risk for method failure. There are several reasons whythere are contraceptive failures. Use Table 4.6 to pro-vide patient education concerning a few of the reasonsfor contraceptive failure. Help clients who have chosenabstinence or fertility awareness methods to define thesexual activities in which they want and don't want to par-ticipate. This helps them set sexual limits or boundaries.Help them to develop communication and negotiationskills that will allow them to be successful. Supporting,encouraging, and respecting a couple's choice of absti-nence is vital for nurses.11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 99100 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Cervical Cap Insertion/Removal Technique It is important to be involved in the tting process. To insert the cap, pinch the sides together, com- press the cap dome, insert into the vagina, andplace over the cervix. Use one nger to feel around the entire circumfer- ence to make sure there are no gaps between thecap rim and the cervix. After a minute or two, pinch the dome and tug gen- tly to check for evidence of suction. The cap shouldresist the tug and not slide off easily. To remove the cap, press the index nger against the rim and tip the cap slightly to break the suction,and gently pull out the cap. The woman should practice inserting and removing the cervical cap three times to validate her pro-ciency with this device. Client teaching and counseling regarding the cervical cap Fill the dome of the cap up about one-third full with spermicide cream or jelly. Do not apply spermicideto the rim, since it may interfere with the seal. Wait approximately 30 minutes after insertion be- fore engaging in sexual intercourse to be sure that aseal has formed between the rim and the cervix. Leave the cervical cap in place for a minimum of 6 hours after sexual intercourse. It can be left inplace for up to 48 hours without additional spermi-cide being added. Do not use during menses due to the potential for toxic shock syndrome. Use an alternative methodsuch as condoms during this time. Inspect the cervical cap prior to insertion for cracks, holes, or tears. After using the cervical cap, wash it with soap and water, dry thoroughly, and store in its container. Diaphragm Insertion/Removal Technique Always empty the bladder prior to inserting the diaphragm. Inspect diaphragm for holes or tears by holding it up to a light source, or ll it with water and checkfor a leak. Place approximately a tablespoon of spermicidal jelly or cream in the dome and around the rim ofthe diaphragm. The diaphragm can be inserted up to 6 hours prior to intercourse. Select the position that is most comfortable for insertion: Squatting Leg up, raising the nondominant leg up on a low stool Reclining position, lying on her back in bed Sitting forward on the edge of a chair Hold the diaphragm between the thumb and ngers and compress it to form a \"gure-eight\" shape. Insert the diaphragm into the vagina, directing it downward as far as it will go. Tuck the front rim of the diaphragm behind the pubic bone so that the rubber hugs the front wall ofthe vagina. Feel for the cervix through the diaphragm to make sure it is properly placed. To remove the diaphragm, insert the nger up and over the top side and move slightly to the side,breaking the suction. Pull the diaphragm down and out of the vagina. Client Teaching and Counseling Regarding the Diaphragm Avoid the use of oil-based products such as baby oil, since this may weaken the rubber. Wash the diaphragm with soap and water after use and dry thoroughly. Place the diaphragm back into the storage case. The diaphragm may need to be retted after weight loss or gain or childbirth. Diaphragms should not be used by women with latex allergies.

The vaginal ring is left in place for 3 weeks, then removed and discarded. The vaginal ring is not recommended for women with uterine prolapse or lack of vaginal muscle tone(Youngkin & Davis, 2004).TEACHING GUIDELINES 4.5 Tips for Cervical Caps, Diaphragms, Vaginal Rings, and Condoms (continued)11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 100CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 101 Abortion Abortion is dened as the expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it is viable (Alexander et al., 2007). Abortioncan be a medical or surgical procedure. The purpose ofabortion is to terminate a pregnancy. Surgical abortion isthe most common procedure performed in the UnitedStates (approximately 1.6 million annually) and might bethe most common surgical procedure in the world (Sper-off & Fritz, 2005). Both medical and surgical abortionsare safe and legal in the United States; an abortion is con-sidered a woman's constitutional right based on the fun-damental right to privacy (Curlin et al., 2007). Since the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in 1973, debate has con- tinued over how and when abortions are provided. Every state has laws regulating some aspects of the provisionof abortion, and many have passed restrictions such asparental consent or notication requirements, mandatedcounseling and waiting periods, and limits on fundingfor abortion. Each state addresses these matters inde-pendently, and the laws that are passed or enforced area legislative decision and a function of the political sys-tem. Although opponents of abortion continue to bevery much a part of the current debates, recently theyhave refocused their attention on \"regulation legisla-tion\" to reduce the number of abortions not medicallynecessary.Male Condom Insertion/Removal Technique and Counseling Always keep the condom in its original package until ready to use. Store in a cool, dry place. Spermicidal condoms should be used if available. Check expiration date before using. Use a new condom for each sexual act. Condom is placed over the erect penis prior to insertion. Place condom on the head of the penis and unroll it down the shaft. Leave a half-inch of empty space at the end to collect ejaculate. Avoid use of oil-based products, because they may cause breakage. After intercourse, remove the condom while the penis is still erect. Discard condom after use.Female Condom Insertion/Removal Technique and Counseling Practice wearing and inserting prior to rst use with sexual intercourse. Condom can be inserted up to 8 hours before intercourse. Condom is intended for one-time use. It can be purchased over the counter\u2014one size ts all. Avoid wearing rings to prevent tears; long nger- nails can also cause tears. Spermicidal lubricant can be used if desired. Insert the inner ring high in the vagina, against the cervix. Place the outer ring on the outside of the vagina. Make sure the erect penis is placed inside the female condom. Remove the condom after intercourse. Avoid spilling the ejaculate.TEACHING GUIDELINES 4.5 Tips for Cervical Caps, Diaphragms, Vaginal Rings, and Condoms (continued) FIGURE4.21 The nurse demonstrates insertion of a vaginal ring during client teaching.After clients have chosen a method of contraception, it is important to address the following: Emphasize that a second method to use as a backup is always needed. Provide both oral and written instructions on the method chosen. Discuss the need for STI protection if not using a barrier method. Inform the client about the availability of ECs.11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 101102 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Surgical Abortion Surgical abortion is usually carried out by vacuum aspi- ration or suction curettage. It is an ambulatory proceduredone under local anesthesia. The cervix is dilated prior tosurgery and then the products of conception are removedby suction evacuation. The uterus may gently be scrapedby curettage to make sure that it is empty. The entire pro-cedure lasts about 10 minutes.Medical Abortion In a medical abortion, the woman takes certain medica- tions to induce a miscarriage to remove the products ofconception. There are two methods currently used to ter-minate a pregnancy during the rst trimester. The rstmethod uses methotrexate (an antineoplastic agent) fol-lowed by misoprostol (a prostaglandin agent) given asa vaginal suppository or in oral form 3 to 7 days later.Methotrexate induces abortion because of its toxicity totrophoblastic tissue, the growing embryo. Misoprostolworks by causing uterine contractions, which helps toexpel the products of conception. This method is 90%to 98% successful in completing an abortion (Hatcheret al., 2004). The second method used to induce first-trimester abortions involves using mifepristone (a progesteroneantagonist) followed 48 hours later by misoprostol (aprostaglandin agent), which causes contractions of theuterus and expulsion of the uterine contents. Mifepris-tone, the generic name for RU-486, is sold under thebrand names Mifeprex and Early Option. Mifepristone isReduce pregnancies among adolescent females.

This method is95% effective when used within 49 days after the lastmenstrual cycle (Hatcher et al., 2004). Abortion is a very emotional, deeply personal issue. Give support and accurate information. If for personal,religious, or ethical reasons you feel unable to actively par-ticipate in the care of a woman undergoing an abortion,you still have the professional responsibility to ensure thatthe woman receives the nursing care and help she requires.This may necessitate a transfer to another area or a stafngreassignment. Menopause The change of life. The end of fertility. The beginning offreedom. Whatever people call it, menopause is a uniqueand personal experience for every woman. Menopause refers to the cessation of regular menstrual cycles. It is theend of menstruation and childbearing capacity. The av-erage age of natural menopause\u2014dened as 1 year with-out a menstrual period\u2014is 51 years old (Alexander et al.,2007). With current female life expectancy at 80, thisevent comes in the middle of a woman's adult life.ova are surrounded by follicles that produce two major hormones: estrogen, in the form of estradiol, and proges-terone. The cyclic maturation of the ovum bythe hypothalamus. The hypothalamus triggers a cascadeof neurohormones, which act through the pituitary andthe ovaries as a pulse generator for reproduction. This hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis begins to break down long before there is any sign that menopauseis imminent. Some scientists believe that the pulse gen-erator in the hypothalamus simply degenerates; othersspeculate that the ovary becomes more resistant to thepituitary hormone FSH and simply shuts down (Krantz,2007b). The nal act in this well-orchestrated process isamenorrhea. As menopause approaches, more and more of the menstrual cycles become anovulatory. This period of time,usually 2 to 8 years before cessation of menstruation, istermed perimenopause (Manson, 2006). In perimeno- pause, the ovary begins to sputter, producing irregular and missed periods and an occasional hot flash. Whenmenopause nally appears, viable ova are gone. Estrogenlevels plummet by 90%, and estrone, produced in fat cells,replaces estradiol as the body's main form of estrogen.The major hormone produced by the ovaries during thereproductive years is estradiol; the estrogen found inpostmenopausal than estrone (Krantz, 2007). In addition, testosterone levels decrease with menopause. Menopause, with its dramatic decline in estrogen, affects not only the reproductive organs, but also otherbody systems: Brain: hot flashes, disturbed sleep, mood and memory problems Cardiovascular: lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease Skeletal: rapid loss of bone density increases the risk of osteoporosis Breasts: duct and glandular tissues are replaced by fat Genitourinary: vaginal dryness, stress incontinence, cystitis Gastrointestinal: less calcium is absorbed from food, increasing the risk for fractures Integumentary: skin becomes dry and thin, and collagen levels decrease Body shape: more abdominal fat; waist size swells relative to hips Therapeutic Management Menopause should be managed individually. In the past,despite the wide diversity of symptoms and risks, the tra-ditional reaction was to reach for the one-size-ts-all ther-apy: hormone therapy. Today the medical community ischanging its thinking in light of the Women's Health Ini-tiative (WHI) study and the Heart and Estrogen/ProgestinReplacement Study Follow-Up (HERS II), which re ported Humans are virtually the only species to outlive their reproductive capacities.Take NOTE! Menopause signals the end of an era for many women. It concludes their ability to reproduce, and some womennd advancing age, altered roles, and these physiologicchanges to be overwhelming events that may precipitatedepression and anxiety (Kessenich, 2007). Menopausedoes not happen in isolation. Midlife is often experiencedas a time of change and reflection. Change happens inmany arenas: children are leaving or returning home, em-ployment pressures intensify as career moves or decisionsare required, elderly parents require more care or thedeath of a parent may have a major impact, and partnersare retrenching or undergoing their own midlife crises.Women must negotiate all these changes in addition tomenopause. Managing these stressful changes can be verychallenging for many women as they make the transitioninto midlife. A woman is born with approximately 500,000 ova, but only 300 to 400 ever mature fully to be released dur-ing the menstrual cycle. The absolute number of ova inthe ovary is a major determinant of fertility. Over thecourse of her premenopausal life there is a steady declinein the number of immature ova. No one understands thisdepletion, but it does not occur in isolation. Maturing11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 103104 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN that long-term hormone therapy (HT) increased the risks of heart attacks, strokes, and breast cancer; in short, theoverall health risks of HT exceeded the benets (WritingGroup, 2002, p. 321). In addition, HT didn't protectagainst the development of coronary artery disease, nordid it prevent the progression of coronary artery disease,as it was previously touted to do (Shelby & O'Hair,2007). As expected, the fallout from this study and othersforced practitioners to re-evaluate their usual therapiesand tailor treatment to each client's history, needs, andrisk factors. There is a universe of treatment options out there, but factors in the client's history should be the drivingforce when determining therapy. Women need to edu-cate themselves about the latest research ndings andcollaborate with their health care provider on the rightmenopause therapy. The following factors should be con-sidered in management: HT is not indicated to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease, according to WHI. Instead, consider lipid-lowering agents and lifestyle changes if risk or diseaseis present. HT should not be taken for more than 5 years for vasomotor symptoms. Use the lowest dose possible for any hormone therapy. HT is acceptable as long as there is a clear indication for use, the woman is under medical supervision, andshe is aware of the risks and benets (North AmericanMenopause Society, 2004). Consider nonhormonal therapies such as bisphospho- nates and selective estrogen receptor modulators(SERMs). Consider weight-bearing exercises, calcium, vitamin D, smoking cessation, and avoidance of alcohol to treat orprevent osteoporosis. Annual breast examinations and mammograms are essential. Local estrogen creams can be used for vaginal atrophy. Consider herbal therapies for symptoms (Krantz, 2007). Although numerous symptoms have been attributed to menopause (Box 4.9), some of them are more closelyrelated to the aging process than to estrogen deciency.A few of the more common menopausal conditions andtheir management will be discussed. Managing Hot Flashes and Night Sweats Hot flashes and night sweats are classic signs of estrogendeciency and the predominant complaint of perimeno-pausal women. A hot flash is a transient and sudden sen-sation of warmth that spreads over the body, particularlythe neck, face, and chest. Hot flashes are caused by vaso-motor instability. Nearly 85% of menopausal women ex-perience them (Alexander et al., 2007). Hot flashes are anearly and acute sign of estrogen deciency. These flashescan be mild or extreme and can last from 2 to 30 minutes (Grady, 2006). There are many options for treating hot flashes. Treat- ment must be based on symptom severity, the client's medical history, and the client's values and concerns.Although the gold standard in the treatment of hot flashesis estrogen, this is not recommended for all women. Thefollowing are suggestions for the management of hotflashes: Clonidine (central alpha-adrenergic agonist) weekly patch Neurontin (anti-seizure) decreased hot flashes Acupuncture reduced frequency of hot (beta-adrenergic shown promise Vitamin E: 100 mg daily (Rubin, 2007) Lifestyle changes Lower room temperature; use fans. Wear clothing in layers for easy removal. Limit caffeine and alcohol intake. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water daily. Stop smoking or cut back. Avoid hot drinks and spicy food. Take calcium (1,200 to 1,500 mg) and vitamin D (400 to 600 IU). Try relaxation techniques, deep breathing, and meditation. Exercise daily, but not just before bedtime.BOX 4.9 Common Symptoms of Menopause Hot flashes or flushes of the head and neck Dryness in the eyes and vagina Personality changes Anxiety and/or depression Loss of libido Weight gain and water retention Night sweats Fatigue Irritability Insomnia Stress 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 104CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 105 Maintain a healthy weight. Identify stressors and learn to manage them. Keep a diary to identify triggers of hot flashes. Alternative therapies Phytoestrogens: isoflavones, ligands, coumenstrols progesterone quai: acts as a form of phytoestrogen Ginseng: purported to improve memory St. John's wort: reduces depression and fatigue Valerian root: induces sleep and relaxation (AAFP, 2006) Many women are choosing alternative treatments for managing menopausal symptoms. Because of their natu- ral origin, women perceive that alternative treatments aresafer. The interest in phytoestrogens came about becauseof the low prevalence of hot flashes in Asian women, whichwas attributed to their diet being rich in phytoestrogens(Manson, 2006). Recent studies have found that black co-hosh, multibotanical herbs, and increased soy intake donot reduce the frequency or severity of menopausal hotflashes or night sweats (ACOG, 2005; Huntzinger, 2006; Seppa, Other remedies foreasing menopausal symptoms might clover,motherwort, ginseng, sarsaparilla root, valerian root, L-tryptophan, calcium-magnesium, and kelp tablets (Haas, 2007). Again, research thus far has been skeptical abouttheir efcacy, but many women report they ease theirsymptoms and their use has skyrocketed. While theremight be some benets to their use, evidence of the ef-cacy of alternative products in menopause is largely anec-dotal. Small, preliminary cli nical trials might demonstrate the safety of some of the nonpharmacologic products.Nurses should be aware of the purported action of theseagents as well as any adverse effects or drug interactions. Managing Urogenital Changes Menopause can be a physically and emotionally challeng-ing time for women. In additional to the psychologicalburden of leaving behind the reproductive phase of lifeand the stigma of an \"aging\" body, sexual difficultiesdue to urogenital changes plague most women but arefrequently not addressed. Vaginal atrophy occurs during menopause because of declining estrogen levels. These changes include thinningof the vaginal walls, an increase in pH, irritation, increasedsusceptibility to infection, dyspareunia, loss of lubrication with intercourse, vaginal dryness, and a decrease in sex-ual desire related to these changes. Decreased estrogenlevels can also influence a woman's sexual function aswell. Delayed clitoral reaction, decreased vag inal lubrica- tion, diminished circulatory response during sexual stim-ulation, and reduced contractions during orgasm have allbeen linked to low estrogen levels (McKinney, 2007). Management of these changes might include the use of estrogen vaginal tablets (Vagifem) or Premarin cream;Estring, and over-the-countermoisturizers and lubricants (Astroglide). A positive outlookon sexuality and a supportive partner are also needed tomake the sexual experience enjoyable and fullling. Sexual health is an important aspect of the human experience. By keeping an open mind, listening to women, and providing evidence-basedtreatment options, the nurse can help improve qualityof life for menopausal women.Take NOTE! Preventing and Managing Osteoporosis Women are greatly affected by osteoporosis after meno-pause. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bone mass declines to such an extent that fractures occur with mini-mal trauma. Bone loss begins in the third or fourth decade of a woman's life and accelerates rapidly after menopause.It affects 8 million women, with millions more at high riskfor developing it. This translates to 1 in 2 women over theage of 50 having an osteoporosis-related fracture in theirlifetime (Alexander et al., 2007). This condition puts manywomen into long-term care, with a resulting loss of inde-pendence. Figure 4.22 shows the skeletal changes associ-ated with osteoporosis. Most women with osteoporosis don't know they have the disease until they sustain a fracture, usually of the wristor hip. Risk factors include: Increasing age Postmenopausal status without hormone replacement Small frame, thin-boned Caucasian or Asian Impaired eyesight Rheumatoid arthritis Family history of osteoporosis Sedentary lifestyle History of treatment with: Antacids with aluminum Heparin Steroids Thyroid replacement drugs11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 105106 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Smoking and consuming alcohol Low calcium and vitamin D intake Excessive amounts of caffeine Anorexia nervosa or bulimia (Hansberger, 2007) Screening tests to measure bone density are not good predictors for young women who might be at risk for de-veloping this condition. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiome-try (DXA or DEXA) is a screening test that calculates themineral content of the bone at the spine and hip. It ishighly accurate, fast, and relatively inexpensive (McNally,Kenny & Smith, 2007). The best management for this painful, crippling, and potentially fatal disease is prevention. Women can modifymany risk factors by doing the following: Engage in daily weight-bearing exercise, such as walking. Increasing calcium and vitamin D intake. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol. Discuss your bone health with your health care provider. When appropriate, have a bone density test and take medication if needed (National OsteoporosisFoundation, 2007). Medications that can help in preventing and manag- ing osteoporosis include: HT (Premarin) Calcitonin (Miacalcin) (Hansberger, 2007)Preventing and Managing Cardiovascular Disease Although cardiovascular disease is still thought of as a \"man's disease,\" it is the major killer of postmenopausalwomen 50 to 75 years of age (Rosano et al., 2007). Halfa million women die annually in the United States ofcardiovascular disease, with strokes accounting for about20% of the deaths (Alexander et al., 2007). This translatesinto approximately one death every minute. Coronaryheart disease accounts for the majority of cardiovasculardeaths in women, with nearly two thirds of these womendying suddenly without any previously recognized symp-toms (Hackley, Kriebs & Rousseau, 2007). For the rst half of a woman's life, estrogen seems to be a protective substance for the cardiovascular systemby smoothing, relaxing, and dilating blood vessels. Iteven helps boost HDL and lower LDL levels, helpingto keep the arteries clean from plaque accumulation. Butwhen estrogen levels plummet as women age and experi-ence menopause, the incidence of cardiovascular diseaseincreases dramatically. Menopause is not the only factor that increases a woman's risk for cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle and med-icalhistory factors such as the following play a major role: Smoking Obesity High-fat diet Sedentary lifestyle High cholesterol levels Family history of cardiovascular disease Hypertension Apple-shaped body Diabetes Two of the major risk factors for coronary heart dis- ease are hypertension and dyslipidemia. Both are mod-ifiable and can be prevented by lifestyle changes and, ifneeded, controlled by medication. This is why preven-tion is essential. In addition, women who experienceearly menopause lose the protection afforded by endoge- nous estrogen to the cardiac system and are at greater riskfor more extensive atherosclerosis. Major preventive strategies include a healthy diet, increased activity, exer-cise, smoking cessation, decreased alcohol intake, andweight reduction. Raising awareness of heart disease in women is an essential role for nurses. Lifestyle interventions are effec-tive in preventing cardiovascular disease in all individ- ualsregardless of their underlying risk (Hackley, Kriebs & Rousseau, 2007). Stressing the importance of lifestylemodications must begin early in life and should be re-inforced from the beginning of a young woman's repro-ductive years through menopause. Nurses are in an idealposition to teach the importance of good nutrition, healthyweight, and daily exercise before cardiovascular diseasebecomes clinically evident. FIGURE4.22 Skeletal changes associated with osteoporosis. (John Radcliffe Hospital/Photo Researcher Inc.)11223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 106Nursing Assessment Menopause is a universal and irreversible part of the overall aging process involving a woman's reproductivesystem. While not a disease state, menopause does placewomen at greater risk for the development of many con-ditions of aging. Nurses can help the woman becomeaware of her risk for postmenopausal diseases, as well asstrategies to prevent them. The nurse can be instrumen-tal in assessing risk factors and planning interventions incollaboration with the client. These might include: Screening for osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer risk Assessment of blood pressure to identify hypertension Blood cholesterol to identify hyperlipidemia risk Mammogram to nd a cancerous lesion Pap smear to identify cervical cancer Pelvic examination to identify endometrial cancer or masses Digital rectal examination to assess for colon cancer Bone density testing as a baseline at menopause to identify osteopenia (low bone mass), which mightlead to osteoporosis Assessing lifestyle to plan strategies to prevent chronic conditions: Dietary intake of fat, cholesterol, and sodium Weight management Calcium intake Use of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine Performance of breast self-examinations Nursing Management There is no \"magic bullet\" in managing menopause.Nurses can counsel women about their risks and help themto prevent disease and debilitating conditions with specichealth-maintenance education. Women should make theirown decisions, but the nurse should make sure they arearmed with the facts to do so intelligently. Nurses can offera thorough explanation of the menopausal process, includ-ing the latest research ndings, to help women understandand make decisions about this inevitable event. If the woman decides to use HT to control her menopausal symptoms, after being thoroughly educated,she will need frequent reassessment. There are no hard-and-fast rules that apply to meeting a woman's individ-ual needs. The nurse can provide realistic expectations ofthe therapy to reduce the woman's anxiety and concern. It is also useful to emphasize the value of friends to gain support and share information and resources. Often justtalking about emotional difculties like a death of a parentor problematic relationships helps solve problems. It alsoshows the woman that her emotional responses are valid. Healthy lifestyles and stress management techniques are vital to health and longevity, and it is important to keepthese on the client's agenda when discussing menopause(Staff of Boston Women's Health Book Collective, 2007).Evidence-based interventions include lifestyle modica- tions, risk management therapies, and preventive druginterventions, such as the following: Participate actively in maintaining health. Exercise regularly. Take supplemental calcium and eat appropriately to prevent osteoporosis. Stop smoking to prevent lung and heart disease. Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake to prevent osteoporosis. Monitor blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes (drug therapy management). Use low-dose aspirin. Reduce dietary intake of fat, cholesterol, and sodium to prevent cardiovascular disease. Maintain a healthy weight for body frame. Perform breast self-examinations to detect breast lesions. Control stress (Dormire & Becker, 2007). These life approaches may seem low-tech, but they can stave off menopause-related complications such ascardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and depression.These tips for healthy living work well, but the clientneeds to be motivated to stick with them. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Establishing good health habits and avoiding risky behaviors early in life will prevent chronic conditionslater on. /H18546There are more than 200 symptoms of PMS, and at least two different syndromes have been recognized:PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). /H18546Endometriosis is a condition in which bits of function- ing endometrial tissue are located outside their normalsite, the uterine cavity. /H18546Infertility is a widespread problem that has an emo- tional, social, and economic impact on couples. /H18546More than half (53%) of all unintended pregnancies occur in women who report using some method of birth control during the month of conception. /H18546Hormonal methods include oral contraceptives, inject- ables, implants, vaginal rings, and transdermal patches. /H18546Recent studies have shown that the extension of active oral contraceptive pills carries the same safety proleas the conventional 28-day regimens. /H18546Currently there are three IUSs available in the United States: the copper ParaGard-T-380A; a levonorgestrel-releasing /H18546Sterilization is the most popular method of contracep- tion in the United States and worldwide. /H18546Menopause, with a dramatic decline in estrogen levels, affects not only the reproductive organs but also otherbodily systems.CHAPTER 4 COMMON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES 10711223-04_CH04.qxd 8/4/08 2:41 PM Page 107108 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN /H18546Most women with osteoporosis do not know they have the disease until they sustain a fracture, usually of thewrist or hip. /H18546Half a million women die annually in the United States of cardiovascular diseases, with strokes accounting forabout 20% of the deaths. /H18546Nurses should aim to have a holistic approach to the sexual health of women from menarche throughmenopause.

STIs pose a serious threat not onlyto women's sexual health but also to the general health andwell-being of millions of people worldwide. STIs consti-tute an epidemic of tremendous magnitude. An estimated65 million people live with an incurable STI, and another15 million are infected each year (CDC, 2006). The inci-dence of STIs continues to rise in the United States. STIs are biologically sexist, presenting greater risk and causing more complications among women than amongmen. Women are diagnosed with two thirds of the esti-mated 15 million new cases of STIs annually in the United States. After only a single exposure, women are twice aslikely as men to acquire infections from pathogens causinggonorrhea, chlamydia infection, hepatitis B, and syphilis(Johnson-Mallard et al., 2007). STIs may contribute tocervical cancer, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronicpelvic pain, and death. Certain infections can be trans-mitted in utero to the fetus or during childbirth to thenewborn (Table 5.1). STIs know no class, racial, ethnic,or social barriers\u2014all individuals are vulnerable if ex-posed to the infectious organism. The problem of STIshas still not been tackled adequately on a global scale,and until this is done, numbers worldwide will continueto increase. A special section on STIs and adolescents is pre- sented below. This is followed by discussion of specificSTIs categorized according to the CDC framework, whichgroups STIs according to the major symptom manifested(Box 5.1). A section on preventing STIs is included at theend of the chapter.114 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Sexually Transmitted Infections and Adolescents An estimated two thirds of all STIs occur among persons under the age of 25 (Waugh, 2007). Each year there are4 million cases of STIs among teenagers. In the UnitedStates, teens who are sexually active experience high ratesof STIs, and some groups are at higher risk, includingAfrican-American youths, abused youths, homeless youths,S Chlamydia (genital herpes) Syphilis Trichomoniasis Venereal wartsSTI Effects on Fetus or Newborn Can be infected during delivery Eye infections (neonatal conjunctivitis), pneumonia, low birthweight, preterm birth, stillbirth Can be infected during delivery Rhinitis, vaginitis, urethritis, inflammation of sites of fetal monitoringOphthalmia neonatorum can lead to blindness and sepsis (including arthritis and meningitis).

For teens who have already had sexualintercourse, the clinician can encourage abstinence at thispoint. If adolescents are sexually active, they should be directed to teen clinics and contraceptive options should be explained. In areas where specialized teen clinics arenot available, nurses should feel comfortable discussingsexuality, safety, and contraception with teens. Encour-age adolescents to minimize their lifetime number of sexual partners, to use barrier methods consistently andcorrectly, and to be aware of the connection between drugand alcohol use and the incorrect use of barrier methods.Table 5.3 discusses barriers to condom use and means toovercome them. Think back to Sandy, who was introduced at the beginning of the chapter. How should the nurse handle Sandy's anxious state? What specic questions should the nurse ask Sandy to determine the source of the possible infection in her genital area? Infections Characterized by Vaginal Discharge Vaginitis is a generic term that means inflammation and infection of the vagina. There can be hundreds of causes for vaginitis, but more often than not the cause is infection by one of three organisms: Candida, a fungus Trichomonas, a protozoan Gardnerella, a bacterium The complex balance of microbiological organisms in the vagina is a key element in the maintenance of health. Subtle shifts in the vaginal environment may allow organ-isms with pathologic potential to proliferate, causing infec-tious symptoms. The nurse's role in managing vaginitis is one of pri- mary prevention and education to limit recurrences ofthese infections. Primary prevention begins with changingthe sexual behaviors that place women at risk for infection.In addition to assessing women for the common signs andsymptoms and risk factors, the nurse can help womento avoid vaginitis or to prevent a recurrence by teachingthem to take the precautions highlighted in TeachingGuidelines 5.2. VULVOVAGINAL CANDIDIASIS Vulvovaginal candidiasis is one of the most common causes of vaginal discharge. It is also referred to as yeast, monilia, and a fungal infection. It is not considered anCHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 115 It is estimated that before graduating from high school, 25% of adolescents will contract an STI (Pickering, 2006).Take NOTE! Biological and behavioral factors place teenagers at high risk. Female adolescents are more susceptible to STIsdue to their anatomy. During adolescence and young adulthood, women's columnar epithelial cells are especially sensitive to invasion by sexually transmitted organisms,such as chlamydia and gonococci, because they extend outover the vaginal surface of the cervix, where they are unpro-tected by cervical mucus; these cells recede to a more pro- tected location as women age. Behaviorally, adolescent andyoung adults tend to think they are invincible and deny therisks of their behavior. This risky behavior exposes them toSTIs and HIV/AIDS. Adolescents frequently have unpro-tected intercourse, they engage in partnerships of limitedduration, and they face many obstacles that prevent them from using the health care system. Nursing Assessment Many health care providers fail to assess adolescent sex- ual behavior and STI risks, to screen for asymptomaticinfection during clinic visits, or to counsel adolescents on STI risk reduction. Nurses need to remember that they play a key role in the detection, prevention, and treat-ment of STIs in adolescents. All states allow adolescentsto give consent to condential STI testing and treatment.Table 5.2 discusses clinical manifestations of common STIs in adolescents. Nursing Management Encourage the client to complete the antibiotic prescrip- tion (specic management for each type of STI is dis-cussed below). Prevention of STIs among adolescents is critical. Health care providers have a unique opportunity to pro- vide counseling and education to their clients. Adapt the style, content, and message to the client's developmentallevel. Identify risk factors and risk behaviors and guide the client to develop specic individualized actions of pre-vention. Your interaction with the client needs to be directand nonjudgmental. Encourage adolescents to postpone initiation of sex- ual intercourse for as long as possible, but if they choose tohave sexual intercourse, explain the necessity of using bar- rier methods, such as male and female condoms (Teaching (text continues on page 120)11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/14/08 12:06 PM Page dia trachomatisCausative Transmission Diagnostic Female Male Disease Organism Mode Testing Symptoms Symptoms Treatment Chlamydia trachomatis(bacteria) inlaboratorycultures More than one test may beused.TABLE 5.2 STISCOMMON IN ADOLESCENTS May be asymptomatic DysuriaVaginal discharge or pus) EndocervicitisMay lead to pelvic ectopicpregnancy, andinfertility Can cause inflammation of the rectum andlining of the eye(conjunctivitis) Can infect the throat from oral sexualcontact with aninfected partner May be asymptomatic or complica-tions as pelvicinflammatory disease DyspareuniaEndocervicitisArthritisMay lead to pelvic inflammatorydisease, andinfertility of thetubular structure thatconnects the testicle with the vas deferens)and sterility Can cause inflammation of the rectum and lin-ing of the eye (con-junctivitis) Can infect the throat from oral sexualcontact with aninfected partner Most produce symptoms but canbe asymptomatic DysuriaPenile discharge (pus)ArthritisMay lead to epididymitis need evaluation, testing, and treatment also.

An estimated 75% of women willhave at least one episode of vulvovaginal candidiasis, and40% to 50% will have two or more episodes in their life time (CDC, 2006). Therapeutic Management Treatment of candidiasis includes one of the followingmedications: Miconazole (Monistat) cream or suppository Clotrimazole (Mycelex) (Terazol) cream or intravaginal suppository Fluconazole (Diflucan) oral tablet (CDC, 2006, p. 55) Most of the above medications are used intravaginally in the form of a cream, tablet, or suppositories used for3 to 7 days. If fluconazole (Diflucan) is prescribed, a150-mg oral tablet is taken as a single dose.120 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Topical azole preparations are effective in the treat- ment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, relieving symptoms andproducing negative cultures in 80% to 90% of women whocomplete therapy (CDC, 2006). If vulvovaginal candidia-sis is not treated effectively during pregnancy, the newborn can develop an oral infection known as thrush during thebirth process; that infection must be treated with a localazole preparation after birth. Nursing Assessment Assess the patient's health history for predisposing factorsfor vulvovaginal candidiasis, which include: Pregnancy Use of oral contraceptives with a high estrogen content Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics Diabetes mellitus Obesity Use of steroid and immunosuppressive drugs HIV infection Wearing tight, restrictive clothes and nylon underpants Trauma to vaginal mucosa from chemical irritants or douching Assess the patient for clinical manifestations of vulvo- vaginal candidiasis. Typical symptoms, which can worsenjust before menses, include: Pruritus Vaginal discharge (thick, white, curd-like) soreness burning Erythema in the vulvovaginal area Dyspareunia External dysuria Figure 5.1 shows the typical appearance of vulvovagi- nal candidiasis. Speculum examination will reveal white plaques on the vaginal walls. The vaginal pH remains within normalrange. Denitive diagnosis is made by a wet smear, whichreveals the lamentous hyphae and spores characteristicof a fungus when viewed under a microscope. Nursing Management Teach preventive measures to women with frequent vulvo- vaginal candidiasis infections, including: Reduce dietary intake of simple sugars and soda. Wear white, 100% cotton underpants. Avoid wearing tight pants or exercise clothes with spandex. Shower rather than taking tub baths. Wash with a mild, unscented soap and dry the genitals gently. Avoid the use of bubble baths or scented bath products. Wash underwear in unscented laundry detergent and hot water.TEACHING GUIDELINES 5.1 Proper Condom Use Use latex condoms. Use a new condom with each act of sexual intercourse. Never reuse a condom. Handle condoms with care to prevent damage fromsharp objects such as ngernails and teeth. Ensure condom has been stored in a cool, dry placeaway from direct sunlight. Do not store condomsin wallet or automobile or anywhere they would beexposed to extreme temperatures. Do not use a condom if it appears brittle, sticky, ordiscolored. These are signs of aging. Put condom on before any genital contact. Put condom on when penis is erect. Ensure it isplaced so it will readily unroll. Hold the tip of the condom while unrolling. Ensurethere is a space at the tip for semen to collect, butmake sure no air is trapped in the tip. Ensure adequate lubrication during intercourse. Ifexternal lubricants are used, use only water-basedlubricants such as KY jelly with latex condoms.Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants, such asbody lotion, massage oil, or cooking oil, can weakenlatex condoms. Withdraw while penis is still erect, and hold condomrmly against base of penis. Adapted from Pickering, L. K. (Ed.) (2006). Red book: 2006 report of the committee on infectious diseases (27th ed.).

Avoid vaginal sprays/deodorants. Avoid wearing pantyhose (or cut out the crotch to allow air circulation). Use white, unscented toilet paper and wipe from front to back. Avoid douching (which washes away protective vaginal mucus). Avoid the use of super-absorbent tampons (use pads instead). TRICHOMONIASIS Trichomoniasis is another common vaginal infection that causes a discharge. The woman may be markedlysymptomatic or asymptomatic. Men are asymptomaticcarriers. Although this infection is localized, there is in-creasing evidence of preterm birth and postpartum en-dometritis in women 2006).Trichomonas vaginalis is an ovoid, single-cell protozoanCHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 121 parasite that can be observed under the microscope mak- ing a jerky swaying motion. Therapeutic Management A single 2-gram dose of oral metronidazole (Flagyl) ortinidazole (Tindamax) for both partners is a commontreatment for this infection. Sex partners of women withtrichomoniasis should be treated to avoid recurrence ofinfection. Nursing Assessment Assess the patient for clinical manifestations of trichomo-niasis, which include: A heavy yellow/green or gray frothy or bubbly discharge Vaginal pruritus and vulvar soreness may bleed on contact Dysuria Colpitis macularis (\"strawberry\" look on cervix) Figure 5.2 shows the typical appearance of tricho- moniasis. The diagnosis is conrmed when a motile flagellated trichomonad is visualized under the microscope.

Decreases spontaneity of sexual activityEmbarrassing, juvenile, \"unmanly\" Poor t (too small or too big, slips off, uncomfortable) Requires prompt withdrawal after ejaculation Fear of breakage may lead to less vigorous sexual activity. Non-penetrative sexual activity Allergy to latexPerceived Barrier Intervention Strategy Encourage patient to try. Put a drop of water-based lubricant or saliva inside the tip of the condom or on the glans of the penis before putting on the condom. Try a thinner latex condom or a different brand or more lubrication. Incorporate condom use into foreplay. Remind patient that peace of mind may enhance pleasure for self and partner. Remind patient that it is \"manly\" to protect himself and others. Smaller and larger condoms are available. Reinforce the protective nature of prompt withdrawal and suggest substitut- ing other postcoital sexual activities. With prolonged intercourse, lubricant wears off and the condom begins to rub. Have a water-soluble lubricant available to reapply. Condoms have been advocated for use during fellatio; unlubricated condoms may prove best for this purpose due to the taste of the lubricant. Other barriers, such as dental dams or an unlubricated condom, can be cut down the middle to form a barrier; these have been advocated for useduring certain forms of non-penetrative sexual activity (e.g., cunnilingusand anolingual sex). Polyurethane male and female condoms are available.

The cause of the microbial alteration isnot fully understood but is associated with having multi-ple sex partners, douching, and lack of vaginal lactobacilli(CDC, 2006). Research suggests that bacterial vaginosisis associated with preterm labor, premature rupture ofmembranes, chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis,and pelvic inflammatory disease (CDC, 2006).

Primary pre-vention begins with changing the sexual behaviors thatplace women at risk for infection. In addition to assessingwomen for common signs, symptoms, and risk factors,Source: G\u00fclmezoglu A. M. (2007). Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD000220. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000220.Study Trichomoniasis is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Symptoms include vaginal itching and discharge.It is not clear whether pregnant women with trichomoniasisare more likely to give birth preterm or to have other preg-nancy complications. The review of trials found that the drugmetronidazole is effective against trichomoniasis when takenby women and their partners during pregnancy, but it mayharm the baby. Of the two clinical trials reviewed, one wasstopped early because women taking metronidazole weremore likely to give birth preterm and have low-birthweightbabies. Further research into trichomoniasis treatments forpregnant women is needed. Findings Metronidazole is effective against a trichomoniasis infectionduring pregnancy but may increase the risk of preterm andlow-birthweight babies.Nursing Implications The nurse's role concerning this study's results is to counselwomen diagnosed with trichomoniasis during pregnancyabout the potential risks of treatment. The woman shouldbe cautioned about taking this medication if she has aprevious history of preterm births, is carrying twins, or isexperiencing preterm contractions. In addition, an ultrasoundshould validate the fetal weight linked to the gestationalage to make sure it is within normal range before thismedication is prescribed.

Infections Characterized by Cervicitis Cervicitis is a catchall term that implies the presence of inflammation or infection of the cervix. It is used to describeeverything from symptomless erosions to an inflamed cervixthat bleeds on contact and produces quantities of purulent discharge containing organisms not ordinarily found in the vagina. Cervicitis is usually caused by gonorrhea orchlamydia, as well as almost any pathogenic bacterial agentand a number of viruses. The treatment of cervicitis in-volves the appropriate therapy for the specic organismthat has caused it. CHLAMYDIA Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the United States. The CDC estimates that there are 4 million newcases each year; the highest predictor for the infection isage. The highest rates of infection are among those ages 15to 19, mainly because their sexual relations are often un-planned and are sometimes the result of pressure or force,and typically happen before they have the experience andskills to protect themselves. The rates are highest amongthis group regardless of demographics or location (CDC,2006). The young have the most to lose from acquiringSTIs, since they will suffer the consequences the longestand might not reach their full reproductive potential. Asymptomatic infection is common among both men and women. Men primarily develop urethritis. In women,chlamydia is linked with cervicitis, acute urethral syn-drome, ectopic and infertility (Marrazzo & Martin,2007). Chlamydia causes half of the 1 million recognizedcases of PID in the United States each year, and treatmentcosts run over $1 billion yearly. Chlamydia trachomatis is the bacterium that causes chlamydia. It is an intracellular parasite that cannot pro-duce its own energy and depends on the host for survival.It is often difcult to detect, and this can pose problems forwomen due to the long-term consequences of untreatedinfection. Moreover, lack of treatment provides more op-portunity for the infection to be transmitted to sexual part-ners. Newborns delivered to infected mothers may developconjunctivitis or pneumonitis and have a 50% to 70% riskof acquiring the infection (Glasier et al., 2006). Therapeutic Management Antibiotics are usually used in treating this STI. The CDC treatment options for chlamydia include doxycy-124 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN cline (Vibromycin) 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days or azithromycin (Zithromax) 1 gram orally in a single dose.Because of the common co-infection of chlamydia andgonorrhea, a combination of ceftriaxone (Ro-cephin) with doxycycline or azithromycin is prescribedfrequently (CDC, 2006). Additional CDC guidelinesfor patient management include annual screening of allsexually active women aged 20 to 25 years old; screen-ing of all high-risk people; and treatment with antibi-otics effective against both gonorrhea and chlamydiafor anyone diagnosed with a gonococcal infection (CDC,2006). Nursing Assessment Assess the health history for signicant risk factors forchlamydia, which may include: Being an adolescent Having multiple sex partners Having a new sex partner Engaging in sex without using a barrier contraceptive (condom) Using oral contraceptives Being pregnant Having a history of another STI (Geisler, 2007) Assess the client for clinical manifestations of chlamy- dia. The majority of women (70% to 80%) are asympto-matic (CDC, 2006). If the client include: Mucopurulent vaginal discharge Urethritis Bartholinitis Endometritis Salpingitis Dysfunctional uterine bleeding The diagnosis can be made by urine testing or swab specimens collected from the endocervix or vagina. Cul-ture, direct immunofluorescence, EIA, or nucleic acid am-plication methods by polymerase chain reaction or ligasechain reaction (DNA probe, such as GenProbe or Pace2)are highly sensitive and specic when used on urethral andcervicovaginal swabs. They can also be used with goodsensitivity and specicity on rst-void urine specimens(Mehta, 2007). The chain reaction tests are the most sen-sitive and cost-effective. The CDC strongly recommendsscreening of asymptomatic women at high risk in whom in-fection would otherwise go undetected (CDC, 2006). GONORRHEA Gonorrhea is a serious and potentially very severe bac- terial infection. It is the second most commonly reportedinfection in the United States. Gonorrhea is highly con-11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 124tagious and is a reportable infection to the health depart- ment authorities. Gonorrhea increases the risk for PID,infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and HIV acquisition andtransmission (CDC, 2007a, 2007b, 2007d). It is rapidlybecoming more and more resistant to cure. In the UnitedStates, an estimated 600,000 new gonorrhea infectionsoccur annually (CDC, 2006). In common with all otherSTIs, it is an equal-opportunity infection\u2014no one is im-mune to it, regardless of race, creed, gender, age, or sex-ual preference. The cause of gonorrhea is an aerobic gram-negative intracellular diplococcus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The of infection is the columnar epithelium of the endocervix.Gonorrhea is almost exclusively transmitted by sexual ac-tivity. In pregnant women, gonorrhea is associated withchorioamnionitis, premature labor, premature rupture ofmembranes, and postpartum endometritis (Peterson et al., 2007). It can also be transmitted to the newborn inthe form of ophthalmia neonatorum during birth by di-rect contact with gonococcal organisms in the cervix.Ophthalmia neonatorum is highly contagious and if un-treated leads to blindness in the newborn. Therapeutic Management The treatment of choice for uncomplicated gonococcalinfections is cexime (Suprex) 400 mg orally in a singledose or ceftriaxone (Rocephine) 125 mg intramuscularlyin a single dose. doxy-cycline (Vibromycin) should accompany all gonococcaltreatment regimens if chlamydial infection is not ruledout (CDC, 2006). Pregnant women should not be treated with quinolones or tetracyclines. Cephalosporins or a sin-gle 2-gram intramuscular dose of spectinomycin prevent gono- coccal ophthalmia neonatorum, a prophylactic agentshould be instilled into the eyes of all newborns; this pro-cedure is required by law in most states. Ery thromycin or tetracycline ophthalmic ointment in a single application is recommended (CDC, 2006). Nursing Assessment Assess the client's health history for risk factors, which mayinclude low socioeconomic status, living in an urban area,single status, inconsistent use of barrier contraceptives,age under 20 years old, and multiple sex partners. Assessthe client for clinical manifestations of gonorrhea, keepingin mind that between 50% and 90% of women infectedwith gonorrhea are totally symptom-free (Glasier et al., 2006). Because women are so frequently asymptomatic,they are regarded as a major factor in the spread of gonor-rhea. If symptoms are present, they might include: Abnormal vaginal discharge Dysuria Cervicitis Abnormal vaginal bleedingCHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 125 Bartholin's abscess PID Neonatal conjunctivitis in newborns Mild sore throat pharyngeal gonorrhea) Rectal infection (asymptomatic) Perihepatitis (Bennett & Domachowske, 2007) Sometimes a local gonorrhea infection is self-limiting (there is no further spread), but usually the organism as-cends upward through the endocervical canal to the en-dometrium of the uterus, further on to the fallopian tubes, and out into the peritoneal cavity. When the peritoneumand the ovaries become involved, the condition is knownas PID. The scarring to the fallopian tubes is permanent.This damage is a major cause of infertility and is a possiblecontributing factor in ectopic pregnancy (Mehta, 2007). If gonorrhea remains untreated, it can enter the blood- stream and produce a disseminated gonococcal infection.This severe form of infection can invade the joints (arthri-tis), the heart (endocarditis), the brain (meningitis), andthe liver (toxic hepatitis). Figure 5.4 shows the typicalappearance of gonorrhea. The CDC recommends screening for all women at risk for gonorrhea. Pregnant women should be screenedat the rst prenatal visit and again at 36 weeks of gesta tion. Nucleic acid hybridization tests (GenProbe) are used fordiagnosis. Any woman suspected of having gonorrheashould be tested for chlamydia also because co-infection(45%) is extremely common (CDC, 2006). Nursing Management of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea The prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea is increasing dramatically, and these infections can have long-termeffects on people's lives. Sexual health is an important part of a person's physical and mental health, and nurses havea professional obligation to address it. Be particularly sen-sitive when addressing STIs because women are oftenembarrassed or feel guilty. There is still a social stigma at-tached to STIs, so women need to be gonor- rhea should include treatment strategies, referral sources,and preventive measures. It is important to be skilled atpatient education and counseling and to be comfortabletalking with, and advising, women diagnosed with theseinfections. Provide education about risk factors for these infec- tions. High-risk groups include single women, womenyounger than 25 years, African-American women, womenwith a history of STIs, those with new or multiple sexpartners, those with inconsistent use of barrier contra-ception, and women living in communities with highinfection rates (Bennett & Domachowske, 2007). As-sessment involves taking a health history that includes acomprehensive sexual history. Ask about the number ofsex partners and the use of safer sex techniques. Reviewprevious and current symptoms. Emphasize the impor-tance of seeking treatment and informing sex partners.The four-level P-LI-SS-IT model (Box 5.2) can be usedto determine interventions for various women becauseit can be adapted to the nurse's level of knowledge, skill,and experience. Of utmost importance is the willingnessto listen and show interest and respect in a nonjudgmen-tal manner. In addition to meeting the health needs of women with chlamydia and gonorrhea, the nurse is responsible for ed-ucating the public about the increasing incidence of theseinfections. This information should include high-riskbehaviors associated with these infections, signs andsymptoms, and the treatment modalities available. Stressthat both of these STIs can lead to infertility and long-term sequelae. Teach safer sex practices to people in non-monogamous relationships. Know the physical and psy-chosocial responses to these STIs to prevent transmissionand the disabling consequences.126 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN BOX 5.2 The P-LI-SS-IT Model P Permission\u2014gives the woman permission to talk about her experience LI Limited Information\u2014information given to the woman about STIs Factual information to dispel myths about STIs Specic measures to prevent transmission Ways to reveal information to her partners Physical consequences if the infections are untreated SS Specic Suggestions\u2014an attempt to help women change their behavior to prevent recurrence andprevent further transmission of the STI IT Intensive Therapy\u2014involves referring the woman or couple for appropriate treatment elsewhere basedon their life circumstances Take NOTE! If the epidemic of chlamydia and gonorrhea is to be halted, nurses must take a major front-line role now. Infections Characterized by Genital Ulcers In the United States, the majority of young, sexually ac- tive patients who have genital ulcers have genital herpes,syphilis, or chancroid. The frequency of each conditiondiffers by geographic area and patient population; how-ever, genital herpes is the m ost prevalent of these diseases. More than one of these diseases can be present in a patient who has genital ulcers. All three of these diseases havebeen associated with an increased risk for HIV infection.Not all genital ulcers are caused by STIs. GENITAL HERPES SIMPLEX Genital herpes is a recurrent, lifelong viral infection. The CDC estimates that 50 million Americans have gen-ital herpes simplex (HSV) infection, with a half millionnew cases (CDC, 2006). Two serotypes of HSVhave been identied: HSV-1 (not sexually transmitted)and HSV-2 (sexually transmitted). Today, approximately10% of genital herpes infections are thought to be causedby HSV-1 and 90% by HSV-2 (Paz-Baily et al., 2007).HSV-1 causes the familiar fever blisters or cold sores onthe lips, eyes, and face. HSV-2 invades the mucous mem-branes of the genital tract and is known as herpes geni-talis. Most persons infected with HSV-2 have not beendiagnosed. The herpes simplex virus is transmitted by contact of mucous membranes or breaks in the skin with visible ornonvisible lesions. Most genital herpes infections are trans- mitted by individuals unaware that they hav e an infection. Many have mild or unrecognized infections but still shedthe herpes virus intermittently. HSV is transmitted pri-marily by direct contact with an infected individual who isshedding the virus. Kissing, sexual contact, and vaginal de-livery are means of transmission. Having sex with an infected partner places the indi- vidual at risk for contracting HSV. After the primary out-break, the virus remains dormant in the nerve cells for life, resulting in periodic recurrent outbreaks. Recurrent geni-tal herpes outbreaks are triggered by precipitating factorssuch as emotional stress, menses, and sexual intercourse,but more than half of recurrences occur without a precip-itating cause. Immunocompromised women have more11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 126frequent and more severe recurrent outbreaks than normal hosts (Paz-Bailey et al., 2007). Living with genital herpes can be difcult due to the erratic, recurrent nature of the infection, the location of thelesions, the unknown causes of the recurrences, and the lackof a cure. Further, the stigma associated with this infection may affect the individual's feelings about herself and herinteraction with partners. Potential psychosocial conse-quences may include emotional distress, isolation, fear ofrejection by a partner, fear of transmission of the disease,loss of condence, and altered interpersonal relationships(Alexander et al., 2007). Along with the increase in the incidence of genital herpes has been an increase in neonatal herpes simplex viral infections, which are associated with a high incidence ofmortality and morbidity. The risk of neonatal infection witha primary maternal outbreak is between 30% and 50%; itis less than 1% with a recurrent maternal infection (CDC, 2006). Therapeutic Management No cure exists, but antiviral drug therapy helps to reduceor suppress symptoms, shedding, and recurrent episodes.Advances in treatment with acyclovir (Zovirax) 400 mgorally three times daily for 7 to 10 days, famciclovir(Famivir) 250 mg orally three times daily for 7 to 10 days,and valacyclovir (Valtrex) 1 gram orally twice daily for7 to 10 days have resulted in an improved quality of lifefor those infected with HSV. However, these drugs neithereradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or sever-ity of recurrences after the drug is discontinued (CDC,2006). Suppressive therapy is recommended for individ-uals with six or more recurrences per year. The naturalcourse of the disease is for recurrences to be less frequentover time. The management of genital herpes includes antiviral therapy. The safety of antiviral therapy has not been estab-lished during pregnancy. Therapeutic management alsoincludes counseling regarding the natural history of thedisease, the risk of sexual and perinatal transmission, andthe use of methods to prevent further spread. Nursing Assessment Assess the client for clinical manifestations of HSV. Clini-cal manifestations can be divided into the primary episode and recurrent infections. The rst or primary episode isusually the most severe, with a prolonged period of viralshedding. Primary HSV is a systemic disease character ized by multiple painful vesicular lesions, mucopurulent dis-charge, superinfection with headache, genital irritation, inguinal tenderness,and lymphadenopathy. The lesions in the primary herpesepisode are frequently located on the vulva, vagina, andperineal areas. The vesicles will open and weep and -nally crust over, dry, and disappear without scar formationCHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 127 (Fig. 5.5 ). This viral shedding process usually takes up to 2 weeks to complete. Recurrent infection episodes are usually much milder and shorter in duration than the primary one. Tingling,itching, pain, unilateral genital lesions, and a more rapidresolution of lesions are characteristics of recurrent infec-tions. Recurrent herpes is a localized disease character ized by typical HSV lesions at the site of initial viral entry. Re-current herpes lesions are fewer in number and less painful and resolve more rapidly (Sharma & Brilliant, 2007). Diagnosis of HSV is often based on clinical signs and symptoms and is conrmed by viral culture of fluid fromthe vesicle. Papanicolaou (Pap) smears are an insensitiveand nonspecic diagnostic test for HSV and should not berelied on for diagnosis. SYPHILIS Syphilis is a complex, curable bacterial infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is a serious sys- temic disease that can lead to disability and death if un-treated. Rates of syphilis in the United States weredeclining, but they remain high among young adults andAfrican-Americans in urban areas and in the south(CDC, 2006). It continues to be one of the most impor-tant STIs both because of its biological effect on HIV ac-quisition and transmission and because of its impact oninfant health (Stoner, 2007). The spirochete rapidly penetrates intact mucous membranes or microscopic lesions in the skin and withinhours enters the lymphatic system and bloodstream toproduce a systemic infection long before the appearanceof a primary lesion. The site of entry may be vaginal, rectal,or oral (Ferguson & Varnado, 2006). The syphilis spiro-chete can cross the placenta at any time during pregnancy.One out of every 10,000 infants born in the United States has congenital syphilis (CDC, 2006). stillbirth, and multisystem failure of the heart, lungs, spleen,liver, and pancreas, as well as structural bone damageand nervous system involvement and mental retardation(Gilbert, 2007). Therapeutic Management Fortunately, there is effective treatment for syphilis. Peni-cillin G, administered by either the intramuscular or intra-venous route, is the preferred drug for all stages of syphilis. For pregnant or nonpregnant women with syphilis of lessthan 1 year's duration, the CDC recommends 2.4 millionunits of benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly in a sin-gle dose. If the syphilis is of longer duration (more than1 year) or of unknown duration, 2.4 million units of ben-zathine penicillin G is given intramuscularly once a weekfor 3 weeks. The preparations used, the dosage, and thelength of treatment depend on the stage and clinical man-ifestations of disease (CDC, 2006). Other medications,such as doxycycline, are available if the client is allergic topenicillin. Women should be re-evaluated at 6 and 12 months after treatment for primary or secondary syphilis withadditional serologic testing. Women with latent syphilisshould be followed clinically and serologically at 6, 12, and24 months (McGregor & Richard, 2007). Nursing Assessment Assess the client for clinical manifestations of syphilis.Syphilis is divided into four stages: primary, secondary,latency, and tertiary. Primary syphilis is characterized bya chancre (painless ulcer) at the site of bacterial entry thatwill disappear within 1 to 6 weeks without intervention(Fig. 5.6). Motile spirochetes are present on darkeld ex-amination of ulcer exudate. In addition, painless bilateraladenopathy is present during this highly infectious period. If left untreated, the infection progresses to the secondarystage. Secondary syphilis appears 2 to 6 months after theinitial exposure and is manifested by flu-like symptoms and128 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN a maculopapular rash of the trunk, palms, and soles. Alope- cia and adenopathy are both common during this stage.In addition to rashes, secondary syphilis may present withsymptoms of fever, pharyngitis, weight loss, and fatigue(Waugh, 2007). The secondary stage of syphilis lasts about 2 years. Once the secondary stage subsides, the latencyperiod begins. This stage is characterized by the absenceof any clinical manifestations of disease, although the serol- ogy is positive. This stage can last as long as 20 years. If nottreated, tertiary or late syphilis occurs, with life-threateningheart disease and neurologic disease that slowly destroysthe heart, eyes, brain, central nervous system, and skin. Clients with a diagnosis of HIV or another STI should be screened for syphilis, and all pregnant women shouldbe screened at their rst prenatal visit. Darkeld micro-scopic examinations and direct fluorescent antibody testsof lesion are the fordiagnosing early syphilis. A presumptive diagnosis can bemade by using Nontreponemal tests (Venereal pallidum particle aggluti- nation [TP-PA]) (CDC, 2006) Nursing Management of Herpes and Syphilis Genital ulcers from either herpes or syphilis can be devas- tating to women, and the nurse can be instrumental inhelping her through this difcult time. Referral to a sup port group may be helpful. Address the psychosocial aspectsof these STIs with women by discussing appropriate cop-ing skills, acceptance of the lifelong nature of the condi- tion (herpes), and options for treatment and rehabilitation. Teaching Guidelines 5.3 highlights appropriate teachingpoints for the patient with genital ulcers. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to an inflammatory state of the upper female genital tract and nearby struc-tures. The fallopian tubes, ovaries, or peritoneum may beinvolved and endometriosis may also be present. PID re-sults from an ascending polymicrobial infection of theupper female reproductive tract, frequently caused by un-treated chlamydia or gonorrhea (Fig. 5.7). An estimated1.5 million cases are diagnosed annually, resulting in over250,000 hospitalizations (CDC, 2006). It is a serioushealth problem in the United States, costing an estimated$10 billion annually in terms of hospitalizations and surgi-cal procedures (Crossma n, 2006). Complica tions include ectopic pregnancy, pelvic abscess, infertility, recurrent orchronic episodes of the disease, chronic abdominal pain,pelvic adhesions, and depression (Glasier et al., 2006). syphilis. 11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 128Because of the seriousness of the complications of PID, an accurate diagnosis is critical. Therapeutic Management Treatment of PID must include empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage of likely pathogens. The client is treatedon an ambulatory basis with oral antibiotics or is hospi-talized and given antibiotics intravenously. The decisionto hospitalize a woman is based on clinical judgment andthe severity of her symptoms (e.g., severely ill with highfever or with protracted vomiting). Frequently, oral anti-biotics are initiated, and if no improvement is seen within72 hours, the woman is admitted to the hospital. Treat-ment then includes intravenous antibiotics, increased oralCHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 129 fluids to improve hydration, bed rest, and pain manage- ment. Follow-up is needed to validate that the infectiousprocess is gone to prevent the development of chronicpelvic pain. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the woman with PID involves acomplete health history and assessment of clinical mani-festations, physical examination, and laboratory and diag-nostic testing. Health History and Clinical Manifestations Explore the client's current and past medical health his tory for risk factors for PID, which may include: Adolescence or young adulthood Nonwhite female Having multiple sex partners Early onset of sexual activity History of PID or STI Sexual intercourse at an early age Alcohol or drug use Having intercourse with a partner who has untreated urethritis Recent insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) Nulliparity Cigarette smoking Engaging in sex during menses (Reyes & Abbuhl, 2007) Lack of consistent condom use Lack of contraceptive use Douching Prostitution Assess the client for clinical manifestations of PID, keeping in mind that, because of the wide variety of clin-ical manifestations of PID, clinical diagnosis can be chal-lenging. To reduce the risk of missed diagnosis, the CDChas established criteria to establish the diagnosis of PID.Minimal criteria (all must be present) are lower abdominaltenderness, adnexal tenderness, and cervical motion ten-derness. Additional supportive criteria that support adiagnosis of PID are: Abnormal cervical or vaginal mucopurulent discharge Oral temperature above 101 \u00b0F Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (inflammatory process) Elevated C-reactive protein level (inflammatory process)N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection documented (causative bacterial organism) White blood cells on saline vaginal smear (CDC, 2006) Prolonged or increased menstrual bleeding Dysmenorrhea Dysuria Painful sexual intercourse Nausea VomitingTEACHING GUIDELINES 5.3 Caring for Genital Ulcers Abstain from intercourse during the prodromal period and when lesions are present. Wash hands with soap and water after touchinglesions to avoid autoinoculation. Use comfort measures such as wearing nonconstrict-ing clothes, wearing cotton underwear, urinating inwater if urination is painful, taking lukewarm sitzbaths, and air-drying lesions with a hair dryer onlow heat. Avoid extremes of temperature such as ice packs orhot pads to the genital area as well as application ofsteroid creams, sprays, or gels. Use condoms with all new or noninfected partners. Inform health care professionals of your condition. Spread of gonorrhea or chlamydia FIGURE5.7Pelvic inflammatory disease. Chlamydia or gonor- rhea spreads up the vagina into the uterus and then to the fal-lopian tubes and ovaries. 11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 129Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Inspect the client for presence of fever (usually over 101 \u00b0F) or vaginal discharge. Palpate the abdomen, noting tender-ness over the uterus or ovaries. However, the only way todiagnose PID denitively is through an endometrial biopsy,transvaginal ultrasound, or laparoscopic examination. Nursing Management If the woman with PID is hospitalized, maintain hydra tion via intravenous fluids if necessary and administer anal gesics as needed for pain. Semi-Fowler's positioning facilitatespelvic drainage. A key element to treatment of PID is ed-ucation to prevent recurrence. Depending on the clinicalsetting (hospital or community clinic) where the nurseencounters the woman diagnosed with PID, a risk assess-ment should be done to ascertain what interventions areappropriate to prevent a recurrence. To gain the woman's cooperation, explain the various diagnostic tests needed.Discuss the implications of PID and the risk factors for theinfection; her sexual partner should be included if possi ble. Sexual counseling should include practicing safer sex,limiting the number of sexual partners, using barrier con-traceptives consistently, avoiding vaginal douching, con-sidering another contraceptive method if she has an IUDand has multiple sexual partners, and completing thecourse of antibiotics prescribed (Reyes & Abbuhl, 2007).Review the serious sequelae that may occur if the condi-tion is not treated or if the woman does not comply withthe treatment plan. Ask the woman to have her partner gofor evaluation and treatment to prevent a repeat infection. Provide nonjudgmental support while stressing the im-portance of barrier contraceptive methods and follow-upcare. Teaching Guidelines 5.4 gives further informationrelated to PID prevention. Human Papillomavirus Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common viralinfection in the United States (CDC, 2007c). Genital warts130 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN or condylomata (Greek for warts) are caused by HPV. Conservative estimates suggest that in the United States,approximately 20 million people have productive HPVinfection, and 5.5 million Americans acquire it annually(CDC, 2007c). Clinical studies have conrmed that HPVis the cause of essentially al l cases of cervical cancer, which is the fourth most common cancer in women in the United States, following lung, bre ast, and colorec tal canc er (ACS, 2007). HPV-mediated oncogenesis is responsible (Gearhart & Randall,2007). More 30 types of HPV can infect the genitaltract. HPV is most prevalent in young women betweenthe ages of 20 and 24 years old, followed closely by the15-to-19-year-old age group (Hackley et al., 2007). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the woman with HPV involves acomplete health history and assessment of clinical mani-festations, physical examination, and laboratory and diag-nostic testing. Health History and Clinical Manifestations Assess the client's health history for risk factors for HPV,which include having multiple sex partners, age (15 to 25), sex with a male who has had multiple sexual partners,and rst intercourse at 16 or younger (Moore & Seybold,2007). Risk factors contributing to the development ofcervical cancer include smoking, few or no screenings forcervical cancer, multiple sex partners, immunosup pressedTEACHING GUIDELINES 5.4 Preventing Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Advise sexually active girls and women to insist their partners use condoms. Discourage routine vaginal douching, as this maylead to bacterial overgrowth. Encourage regular sexually transmitted infectionscreening. Emphasize the importance of having each sexualpartner receive antibiotic treatment.Reduce the proportion of females who have everrequired treatment for pelvicinflammatory disease (PID).Reduce the proportion ofchildless females withfertil ity problems who have had a sexually transmitteddisease or who have everrequired treatment for pelvicinflammatory disease (PID).Educate women that abstinence is the only way to completely avoidcontracting sexually transmittedinfections.Encourage women always to usecondoms if participating in anysexual act.Provide an open and condentialenvironment so women will reportsymptoms and seek treatmentearlier. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Healthy People 2010 Objectives 25-6,7 Signicance Take NOTE! The lifetime risk of HPV infection is estimated to be as high as 80% in sexually active individuals. 11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 130state, long-term contraceptive use (more than 2 years), co-infection with another STI, pregnancy, nutritional de-ciencies, and early onset of sexual activity (Dunne et al.,2007). Assess the client for clinical manifestations of HPV. Most HPV infections are asymptomatic, unrecognized, orsubclinical. Visible genital warts usually are caused by HPVtypes 6 or 11. In addition to the external genitalia, genitalwarts can occur on the cervix and in the vagina, urethra,anus, and mouth. Depending on the size and location, gen- ital warts can be painful, friable, and pruritic, althoughmost are typically asymptomatic (Fig. 5.8). The strains ofHPV associated with genital warts are considered low riskfor development of cervical cancer, but other HPV types(16, 18, 31, 33, and 35) have been strongly associatedwith cervical cancer (CDC, 2006). Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Clinically, visible warts are diagnosed by inspection. The warts are fleshy papules with a warty, granular surface.Lesions can grow very large during pregnancy, affectingurination, defecation, mobility, and descent of the fetus(CDC, 2006). Large lesions, which may resemble cauli-flowers, exist in coalesced clusters and bleed easily. Serial Pap smears are performed for low-risk women. These regular Pap smears will detect the cellular changesassociated with HPV. The FDA has recently approvedan HPV test as a follow-up for women who have an ambigu-ous Pap test. In addition, this HPV test may be a helpfuladdition to the Pap test for general screening of womenage 30 and over. The HPV test is a diagnostic test that candetermine the specic HPV strain, which is useful in dis-criminating between low-risk and high-risk HPV types. Aspecimen for testing can be obtained with a fluid-phasecollection system such as Thin Prep. The HPV test canidentify 13 of the high-risk types of HPV associated withthe development of cervical cancer and can detect high- risk types of HPV even before there are any conclusive visiblechanges to the cervical cells. If the test is positive for theCHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 131 high-risk types of HPV, the woman should be referred for colposcopy. U pon physical examination, it is determined that Sandy has genital warts. The nurse nds out that Sandy engagedin high-risk behavior with a stranger she \"hooked up\" withrecently at college. She couldn't imagine that he would giveher a STI because \"he looked so clean-cut.\" She wondershow she could possibly have genital warts. What informationshould be given to Sandy about STIs in general? Whatspecic information about HPV should be stressed? Therapeutic Management There is currently no medical treatment or cure for HPV.Instead, therapeutic management focuses heavily on pre-vention through the use of the HPV vaccine and educa tion and on the treatment of lesions and warts caused by HPV.In summer 2006, the FDA approved the HPV vaccine(Gardasil) to prevent cervical cancer. The CDC's Advi sory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has rec-ommended the vaccine for routine administration to11- and 12-year-old girls. The ACIP also endorsed the use of Gardasil for girls as young as 9 and recommendedthat women between the ages of 13 and 26 receive thevaccination series, which consists of three injections over 6 months. The vaccine has been f ound 100% effective in preventing precancerous lesions of the cervix and genital warts (Wald, 2007). The duration of protection afforded by this vac cine, as well as its impact on long-term out- comes, is not yet known (Kennedy, 2007). The vaccine is administered intramuscularly in three separate 0.5-mL doses. The rst dose may be given to anyindividual 9 to 26 years old prior to infection with HPV.The second dose is administered 2 months after the rst,and the third dose is given 6 months after the initial dose.The deltoid region of the upper arm or anterolateral areaof the thigh may be used (Leggatt & Frazer, 2007). If the woman doesn't receive primary prevention with the vaccine, then secondary prevention would focus oneducation about the importance of receiving regular Papsmears and, for women over 30, including an HPV test todetermine whether the woman has a latent high-risk virusthat could lead to precancerous cervical changes. Finally,treatment options for precancerous cervical lesions or gen-ital warts caused by HPV are numerous and may in clude: Topical trichloroacetic acid (TCA) 80% to 90% vaporization Client-applied Podolox solution or Simple procedure (LEEP) FIGURE5.8Genital warts. 11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 131 Intralesional interferon therapy (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2007b) The goal of treating genital warts is to remove the warts and induce wart-free periods for the client. Treatment ofgenital warts should be guided by the preference of theclient and available resources. No single treatment hasbeen found to be ideal for all clients, and most treatmentmodalities appear to have comparable efcacy. Becausegenital warts can proliferate and become friable duringpregnancy, they should be removed using a local agent.A cesarean birth is not indicated solely to prevent transmis-sion of HPV infection to the newborn, unless the pelvicoutlet is obstructed by warts (Gearhart & Randall, 2007). Nursing Management An HPV infection has many implications for the woman's health, but most women are unaware of HPV and its rolein cervical cancer. The average age of sexual debut is inearly adolescence; therefore, it is important to target thispopulation for use of the HPV/cervical cancer vaccine. Key nursing roles are teaching about prevention of HPV infection and patient education and promotion ofvaccines and screening tests in order to reduce the morbid-ity and mortality associated with cervical cancer causedby HPV infection. Teach all women that the only way toprevent HPV is to refrain from any genital contact with an-other individual. Although the effect of condoms in pre-venting HPV infection is unknown, latex condom use hasbeen associated with a lower rate of cervical cancer. Teach women about the link between HPV and cervical cancer.Explain that, in most cases, there are no signs or symp toms of infection with HPV. Strongly encourage all youngwomen between 9 and 26 to consider getting Gardasil, the vaccine against HPV. For all women, promote the i mpor- tance of obtaining regular Pap smears and, for womenover 30, suggest an HPV test to rule out the presence ofa latent high-risk strain of HPV. Education and counseling are important aspects of managing women with genital warts. Teach the womanthat: Even after genital warts are removed, HPV still remains and viral shedding will continue. The likelihood of transmission to future partners and the duration of infectivity after treatment for genitalwarts are unknown. The recurrence of genital warts within the rst few months after treatment is common and usually indi cates recurrence rather than reinfection (CDC, 2006). Sandy is being treated for HPV and is anxious for her \"things\" to disappear and never return. What education isneeded to prevent further transmission from Sandy to anyfuture sexual partners?132 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Vaccine-Preventable STIs: Hepatitis A and B Hepatitis is an acute, systemic, viral infection that can be transmitted sexually. The viruses associated with hepatitisor inflammation of the liver are hepatitis A, B, C, D, E,and G. Hepatitis A (HAV) is spread via the gastrointestinaltract. It can be acquired by drinking polluted water, byeating uncooked shellfish from sewage-contaminatedwaters or food handled by a hepatitis carrier with poor hy-giene, and from oral/anal sexual contact. Approximately33% of the U.S. population has serologic evidence of priorhepatitis A infection; the rate increases directly with age(Wasley et al., 2007). A person with hepatitis A can easilypass the disease to others within the same household. Hepatitis B (HBV) is transmitted through saliva, blood serum, semen, menstrual blood, and vaginal se-cretions (Assan & Kraszewski, 2006). In the early 2000s,transmission among heterosexual partners accounted for40% of infections, and transmission among men whohave sex with men accounted for 20% of infections. TheWorld Health Organization (WHO) estimates the preva-lence of hepatitis B worldwide is 350 million chronicallyinfected people. Worldwide, hepatitis B has the highestdeath rate of any STI except HIV (WHO, 2007a). Riskfactors for infection include having multiple sex part-ners, engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse,and having a history of other STIs (CDC, 2006). Themost effective means to prevent the transmission of hep-atitis A or B is pre-exposure immunization. Vaccines areavailable for the prevention of HAV and HBV, both ofwhich can be transmitted sexually. Every person seekingtreatment for an STI should be considered a candidatefor hepatitis B vaccination, and some individuals (e.g.,men who have sex with men, and injection-drug users)should be considered for hepatitis A vaccination(CDC, 2006). Therapeutic Management Unlike other STIs, HBV and HAV are preventablethrough immunization. HAV is usually self-limiting anddoes not result in chronic infection. HBV can result in se-rious, permanent liver damage. Treatment is generallysupportive. No specic treatment for acute HBV infec-tion exists. Nursing Assessment Assess the client for clinical manifestations of hepatitis A and B. Hepatitis A produces flu-like symptoms withmalaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, pruritus, fever, andupper right quadrant pain. Symptoms of hepatitis B aresimilar to those of hepatitis A, but with less fever and skininvolvement. The diagnosis of hepatitis A cannot bemade based on clinical manifestations alone and requiresserologic testing. The presence of IgM antibody to HAV11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 132is diagnostic of acute HAV infection. Hepatitis B is de- tected by a blood test that looks for antibodies and pro-teins produced by the virus and is positively diagnosed bythe presence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAg)(Pyrsopoulos & Reddy, 2007). Nursing Management Nurses should encourage all women to be screened forhepatitis when they have their annual Pap smear, or sooner if high-risk behavior is identied. Nurses should also en-courage women to undergo HBV screening at their rstprenatal visit and repeat screening in the last trimester forwomen with high-risk behaviors (Assan & Kraszewski,2006). Nurses can also explain that hepatitis B vaccine isgiven to all infants after birth in most hospitals. The vac-cination consists of a series of three injections given within 6 months. The vaccine has been shown to be safe and welltolerated by most recipients (CDC, 2006). Hepatitis Avaccine is strongly encouraged for children between 12and 23 months; persons 1 year of age and older travelingto countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A, suchas Central or South America, Mexico, Asia, Africa, andeastern Europe; men who have sex with men; persons whouse street drugs; and persons with chronic liver disease(CDC, 2007c). For others, hepatitis A vaccine series (twodoses 6 months apart) may be started whenever a personis at risk of infection. Ectoparasitic Infections Ectoparasites are a common cause of skin rash and pruri-tus throughout the world, affecting persons of all ages,races, and socioeconomic groups. Overcrowding, delayed diagnosis and treatment, and poor public education con-tribute to the prevalence of ectoparasites in both indus trial and nonindustrial nations. Approximately 300 millioncases of ectoparasitic cases are reported worldwide eachyear (CDC, 2006). These infections include infestationsof scabies and pubic lice. Since these parasites are easilypassed from one person to another during sexual intimacy, clients should be assessed for them when receiving carefor other STIs. Scabies is an intensely pruritic dermatitiscaused by a mite. The female mite burrows under the skinand deposits eggs, which hatch. The lesions start as a small papule that reddens, erodes, and sometimes crusts. Diag-nosis is based on history and appearance of burrows in thewebs of the ngers and the genitalia (Cordoro & Wil son, 2007). Aggressive infestation can occur in immunode-cient, debilitated, or malnourished people, but healthypeople do not usually suffer sequelae. Clients with pediculosis pubis (pubic lice) usually seek treatment because of the pruritus, because of a rashbrought on by skin irritation from scratching, or becausethey notice lice or nits in their pubic hair, axillary hair, ab-dominal and thigh hair, and sometimes in the eyebrows,CHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 133 eyelashes, and beards. Infestation is usually asymptomatic until after a week or so, when bites cause pruritus andsecondary infections from scratching (Fig. 5.9). Diagnosisis based on history and the presence of nits (small, shiny,yellow, oval, dewdrop-like eggs) afxed (a yellowish, oval, wingless insect) (Wolfram, 2007). Treatment is directed at the infested area, using per- methrin cream or lindane shampoo (CDC, 2006). Bed-ding and clothing should be washed in hot water todecontaminate it. Sexual partners should be treated also,as well as family members who live in close contact withthe infected person. Nursing care of a woman infested with lice or scabies involves a three-tiered approach: eradicating the infesta tion with medication, removing nits, and preventing spreador recurrence by managing the environment. Over-the-counter products containing pyrethrins (RID, Triple X,Pronto, and Kwell) are safe for use and kill the active liceor mites. Nurses should provide education about theseproducts (Teaching Guidelines 5.5). The nurse can followthese same guidelines to prevent the health care facilityfrom becoming infested. FIGURE5.9Pubic lice. A small brown living crab louse is seen at the base of hairs ( arrow ). (Source: Goodheart, H. skin disorders. Philadel- phia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.) TEACHING GUIDELINES 5.5 Treating and Minimizing the Spread of Scabies and Pubic Lice Use the medication according to the manufac- turer's instructions. Remove nits with a ne-toothed nit comb. Do not share any personal items with others oraccept items from others. Treat objects, clothing, and bedding and washthem in hot water. Meticulously vacuum carpets to prevent a recurrenceof infestation. 11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 133Human Immunodeciency Virus (HIV) An estimated 1 million people currently live with HIV and an estimated 50,000 new HIV infections have occurredannually in the United States (CDC, 2007b). In terms ofepidemiology, fatality rate, and its social, legal, ethical, andpolitical aspects, HIV/AIDS has become a public health crisis and has generated more concern than any other in-fectious disease in modern medical history (Mullan, 2007).To date, there is no cure for this fatal viral infection. The HIV virus is transmitted by intimate sexual con- tact, by sharing needles for intravenous drug use, frommother to fetus during pregnancy, or by transfusion ofblood or blood products. Men who have sex with men rep-resent the largest proportion of new infections, followed bymen and women infected through heterosexual sex (CDC, 2007b). The number of women with HIV infection and AIDS has been increasing steadily worldwide. WHO estimatesthat over 25 million women are living with HIV/AIDSworldwide, accounting for approximately 50% of the 40 million adults living with HIV/AIDS (National Insti-tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2007a). HIV dis- proportionately affects African-American and Hispanicwomen: together they represent less than 25% of all U.S.women, yet they account for more than 82% of AIDS cases in women (CDC, 2007b). Worldwide, more than 90% ofall HIV infections have resulted from heterosexual inter-course. Women are particularly vulnerable to heterosexualtransmission of HIV due to substantial mucosal exposureto seminal fluids. This biological fact amplies the risk ofHIV transmission when coupled with the high prevalenceof nonconsensual sex, sex without condoms, and theunknown and/or high-risk behaviors of their partners(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,2007a). Therefore, the face of HIV/AIDS is becomingthe face of young women. That shift will ultimately exac-erbate the incidence of HIV because women spread itnot only through sex, but also through nursing andchild birth. AIDS is a breakdown in the immune function caused by HIV, a retrovirus. The infected person develops op-portunistic infections or malignancies that become fatal.Progression from HIV infection to AIDS occurs a medianof 11 years after infection (Mullan, 2007). Twenty years have passed since HIV/AIDS began to affect our society. Since then, 50 million people have beeninfected by the virus, with AIDS being the fourth leadingcause of death globally (CDC, 2007b). The morbidity andmortality of HIV continue to hold the attention of themedical community. While there has been a dramatic im-provement in both morbidity and mortality with the use ofhighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the inci-dence of HIV infection continues to rise.134 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN The fetal and neonatal effects of acquiring HIV through perinatal transmission are devastating and even- tually fatal. An infected mother can transmit HIV infec tion to her newborn before or during birth and through breast- feeding. Most cases of mother-to-child HIV transmission, the cause of more than 90% of pediatric-acquired infec tions worldwide, occur late in pregnancy or during delivery.Transmission rates vary from 25% in untreated non-breastfeeding populations in industrialized countries toabout 40% among untreated breastfeeding populationsin developing countries (National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases, 2007a). Despite the dramatic reduc-tion in perinatal transmission, hundreds of infants will beborn infected with HIV. HIV and Adolescents The effects of HIV and AIDS on adolescents and youngadults is of increasing concern, but it is difcult to get ac-curate data due to varying ways this population seeks health care services. Some adolescents continue to receive carethrough pediatricians and adult services, but many do nothave access to health care. HIV infections are increasingin adolescents and young adults (13 to 24 years). Also,the proportion of adolescents diagnosed with AIDS hasincreased from 4% in 1999 to 6% in 2006 (NIH, 2008).At least one adolescent in the United States is infectedwith HIV each hour. Since it takes an average of 10 yearsfor AIDS symptoms to appear when HIV is left un-treated, it is obvious that many adults with AIDS were in-fected as adolescents. Most HIV-infected adolescents are exposed to the virus though sexual intercourse. Recent data suggest thatthe majority of HIV-infected adolescent males are infected through sex with men. A small number of adolescent males appear to be exposed through injection of drugs or het-erosexual contact. Adolescent females are mostly exposed through heterosexual contact, with a small percentagebecoming infected through injected drug use (www.niaid.hih.gov/factsheets/hivadolescent.htm). African-Americanand Hispanic adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19account for 66% and 21%, respectively, of reported AIDScases in 2003. Because adolescents think they are invin-cible, they may delay testing, and if they test positive, theymay delay treatment or refuse treatment. The inability totrace this population for medical care can lead to increased transmission of HIV. Take NOTE! More than 90% of individuals infected with HIV worldwide do not know they are infected (Dubin, 2007).11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 134Clinical Manifestations When a person is initially infected with HIV, he or she goes through an acute primary infection period for about 3 weeks. The HIV viral load drops rapidly because thehost's immune system works well to ght this initial infec-tion. The onset of the acute primary infection occurs 2 to 6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms include fever, pharyngi-tis, rash, and myalgia. Most people do not associate this flu-like condition with HIV infection. After initial exposure,there is a period of 3 to 12 months before seroconversion.The person is considered infectious during this time. After the acute phase, the infected person becomes asymptomatic, but the HIV virus begins to replicate. Eventhough there are no symptoms, the immune system runsdown. A normal person has a CD4 T-cell count of 450 to1,200 cells per microliter. When the CD4 T-cell countreaches 200 or less, the person has reached the stage ofAIDS. The immune system begins a constant battle to ghtthis viral invasion, but over time it falls behind. A viralreservoir occurs in T cells that can store various stages ofthe virus. The onset and severity of the disease correlatedirectly with the viral load: the more HIV virus that is pres- ent, the worse the person will feel. As profound immunosuppression begins to occur, an opportunistic infection will occur, qualifying the person forthe diagnosis of AIDS. The diagnosis is nally conrmedwhen the CD4 count is below 200. As of now, AIDS willeventually develop in everyone who is HIV-positive.CHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 135 Because HIV over time depletes the CD4 cell popula- tion, infected people become more susceptible to oppor-tunistic infections. Currently, the AIDS virus and responseto treatment are tracked based on CD4 count rather thanviral load. Untreated HIV will progress to AIDS in about11 years, but this progression can be delayed by antiretro-viral therapy (Dubin, 2007). Diagnosis Newly approved quick tests for HIV produce results in20 minutes and also lower the health care worker's risk ofoccupational exposure by eliminating the need to drawblood. The CDC's Advancing HIV Prevention initiative,launched in 2003, has made increased testing a nationalpriority. The initiative calls for testing to be incorporatedinto routine medical care and to be delivered in morenontraditional settings. Fewer than half of adults between the ages of 18 and 64 have ever had an HIV test, according to the CDC.The agency estimates that one fourth of the million HIV-infected people in the United States do not know they areinfected. This means they are not receiving treatment thatcan prolong their lives, and they may be unknowingly in-fecting others. In addition, even when people do get tested, one in three failed to return to the testing site to learn their results when there was a 2-week wait. The CDC hopesthat the new \"one-stop\" approach to HIV testing changesthat pattern. About 50,000 new HIV cases are reportedeach year in the United States, and that number has heldsteady for the past few years despite massive efforts in pre-vention education (CDC, 2007b). The OraQuick Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test detects the HIV antibody in a blood sample taken with a nger stick or from an oral fluid sample. Both can produce results inas little as 20 minutes with more than 99% accuracy (Aaron et al., 2006). The FDA has approved two other rapid blood tests: the Reveal Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test and the Uni- Gold Recombigen HIV Test. Testing for HIV should be offered to anyone seeking evaluation and treatment for STIs. Counseling beforeand after testing is an integral part of the testing proce dure. Informed consent must be obtained before an HIV test isperformed. HIV infection is diagnosed by tests for anti-bodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 (HIV-1/2). Antibodytesting begins with a sensitive screening test (e.g., the en-zyme immunoassay [ELISA]). This is a specific test forantibodies to HIV that is used to determine whether theperson has been exposed to the HIV retrovirus. Reactivescreening tests must be conrmed by a more specic test(e.g., the Western blot [WB]) or an immunofluorescenceassay (IFA). This is a highly specic test that is used to val-idate a positive ELISA test nding. If the supplementaltest (WB or IFA) is positive, it conrms that the personis infected with HIV and is capable of transmitting theConsider THIS! I was thinking of my carefree college days, when the most important thing was having an active sorority lifeand meeting guys. I had been raised by very strict par-ents and was never allowed to date under their watch.Since I attended an out-of-state college, I gured thatmy parents' outdated advice and rules no longer ap plied. Abruptly, my thoughts of the past were interrupted bythe HIV counselor asking about my feelings concerningmy positive diagnosis. What was there to say at thispoint? I had a lot of fun but never dreamed it wouldhaunt me for the rest of my life, which was going to beshortened considerably now. I only wish I could turnback the hands of time and listen to my parents' ad vice, which somehow doesn't seem so outdated now. Thoughts: All of us have thought back on our lives to better times and wondered how our lives would havechanged if we had made better choices or gone downanother path. It is a pity that we have only one chanceto make good, sound decisions at times. What wouldyou have changed in your life if given a second chance? Can you still make a change for the better now? 11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 135virus to others. HIV antibody is detectable in at least 95% of people within 3 months after infection (CDC, 2006). Therapeutic Management The goals of HIV drug therapy are to: Decrease the HIV viral load below the level of detection Restore the body's ability to ght off pathogens Improve the client's quality of life Reduce HIV morbidity and mortality (Cressey & Lallemant, 2007) Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which combines at least three antiretroviral drugs, has dramat-ically improved the prognosis of HIV/AIDS. Often treat-ment begins with combination HAART therapy at the time of the rst infection, when the person's immune system isstill intact. The current HAART therapy standard is a triple combination therapy, but some clients may be given afourth or fth agent. There are obvious challenges involved in meeting these goals. The viral load can be reduced much more quicklythan the T-cell count can be increased, and this disparityleaves the woman vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Current therapy to prevent the transmission of HIV to the newborn includes a three-part regimen of having themother take an oral antiretroviral agent at 14 to 34 weeksof gestation; it is continued throughout pregnancy. Duringlabor, an antiretroviral agent is administered intra venously until delivery. An antiretroviral syrup is administered tothe infant within 12 hours after birth. Dramatic new treatment advances with antiretroviral medications have turned a disease that used to be a deathsentence into a chronic, manageable one for individualswho live in countries where antiretroviral therapy is avail-able. Despite these advances in treatment, however, onlya minority of HIV-positive Americans who take antiretro-viral medications are receiving the full benets because they are not adhering to the prescribed regimen. Successfulantiretroviral therapy requires nearly perfect adherence toa complex medication regimen; less-than-perfect adher-ence leads to drug resistance (Battaglioli-Denero, 2007). Adherence is difcult because of the complexity of the regimen and the lifelong duration of treatment. A typicalantiretroviral regimen may consist of three or more med-ications taken twice daily. Adherence is made even moredifcult because of the unpleasant side effects, such asnausea and diarrhea. Women in early pregnancy alreadyexperience these, and the antiretroviral medication onlyexacerbates them. Nursing Management Nurses can play a major role in caring for the HIV-posi tive woman by helping her accept the possibility of a short ened life span, cope with others' reactions to a stigmatizing ill-ness, and develop strategies to maintain her physical and136 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN emotional health. Educate the woman about changes she can make in her behavior to prevent spreading HIV toothers, and refer her to appropriate community resourcessuch as HIV medical care services, substance abuse, men-tal health services, and social services. See Nursing CarePlan 5.1: Overview for the Woman With HIV. Providing Education About Drug Therapy The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to suppress viral replication so that the viral load becomes undetectable(below 400). This is done to preserve immune function anddelay disease progression but is a challenge because of theside effects of nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, altered taste, anorexia, flatulence, constipation, headaches, anemia, andfatigue. Although not everyone experiences all of the sideeffects, the majority do have some of them. Current re-search hasn't documented the long-term safety of expo sure of the fetus to antiretroviral agents during pregnancy, butcollection of data is ongoing. Help to reduce the development of drug resistance and thus treatment failure by identifying the barriers toadherence; identifying these barriers can help the womanto overcome them. Some of the common barriers existbecause the woman: Does not understand the link between drug resistance and nonadherence Fears revealing her HIV status by being seen taking medication Hasn't adjusted emotionally to the HIV diagnosis Doesn't understand the dosing regimen or schedule Experiences unpleasant side effects frequently Feels anxious or depressed (Dubin, 2007) Depending on which barriers are causing nonadher- ence, work with the woman by educating her about thedosing regimen, helping her nd ways to integrate the pre-scribed regimen into her lifestyle, and making referrals tosocial service agencies as appropriate. By addressing barri-ers on an individual level, the nurse can help the woman toovercome them. Educate the woman about the prescribed drug therapy and stress that it is very important to take the regimenas prescribed. Offer suggestions about how to cope withanorexia, nausea, and vomiting by: Separating the intake of food and fluids Eating dry crackers upon arising Eating six small meals daily Using high-protein supplements (Boost, Ensure) to provide quick and easy protein and calories Eating \"comfort foods,\" which may appeal when other foods don't Promoting Compliance Remaining compliant with drug therapy is a huge chal lenge for many HIV-infected people.

She acquired HIV through unprotected sexual contact. She has been inconsistent in taking her antiretroviral medications and presents today stating she is tired and doesn't feel well. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for infection related to positive HIV status and inconsistent compliance with antiretroviral therapy Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will remain free of opportunistic infections as evidenced by temperature within acceptable parameters and absence of signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections. Interventions: Minimizing the Risk of Opportunistic Infections Assess CD4 count and viral loads to determine disease progression (CD4 counts <500/L and viral loads >10,000 copies/L = increased risk for opportunistic infections). Assess complete blood count to identify presence of infection (>10,000 cells/mm3may indicate infection). Assess oral cavity and mucous membranes for painful white patches in mouth to evaluate for possible fungal infection. Teach client to monitor for general signs and symptoms of infections, such as fever, weakness, and fatigue, to ensure early identication. Provide information explaining the importance of avoiding people with infections when possible to minimize risk of exposure to infections. Teach importance of keeping appointments so her CD4 count and viral load can be monitored to alert the health care provider about her immune system status. Instruct her to reduce her exposure to infections via: Meticulous handwashing Thorough cooking of meats, eggs, and vegetables Wearing shoes at all times, especially when outdoors Encourage a balance of rest with activity throughout the day to prevent overexertion. Stress importance of maintaining prescribed antiretroviral drug therapies to prevent disease progression and resistance. If necessary, refer Annie to a nutritionist to help her understand what constitutes a well-balanced diet with supplements to promote health and ward off infection. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Knowledge decit related to HIV infection and possible complications Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will demonstrate increased understanding of HIV infection as evidenced by verbalizing appropriate health care prac- tices and adhering to measures to comply with therapy and reduce her risk of further exposure and reduce risk of diseaseprogression. Interventions: Providing Patient Education Assess her understanding of HIV and its treatment to provide a baseline for teaching. Establish trust and be honest with Annie; encourage her to talk about her fears and the impact of the disease to provide an outlet for her concerns. Encourage her to discuss reasons for her noncompliance. Provide a nonjudgmental, accessible, condential, and culturally sensitive approach to promote Annie's self-esteem and allow her to feel that she is a priority. Explain measures, including safer sex practices and birth control options, to prevent disease transmission; determine herwillingness to practice safer sex to protect others to determine further teaching needs. Discuss the signs and symptoms of disease progression and potential opportunistic infections to promote early detection for prompt intervention. Outline with the client the availability of community resources and make appropriate referrals as needed to provide additional education and support. Encourage Annie to keep scheduled appointments to ensure follow-up and allow early detection of potential problems.11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 137cult when the same pills that are supposed to thwart the dis- ease are making the person sick. Nausea and diarrhea arejust two of the possible side effects. It is often difcult toincrease the client's quality of life when so much oral med- ication is required. The combination medication therapyis challenging for many people, and staying compliantover a period of years is extremely difcult. Stress the im-portance of taking the prescribed antiretroviral drug ther-apies by explaining that they help prevent replication ofthe retroviruses and subsequent progression of the disease, as well as decreasing the risk of perinatal transmission ofHIV. In addition, provide written materials describingdiet, exercise, medications, and signs and symptoms ofcomplications and opportunistic infections. Reinforce thisinformation at each visit. Preventing HIV Infection The lack of information about HIV infection and AIDS causes great anxiety and fear of the unknown. It is vital totake a leadership role in educating the public about riskybehaviors in the ght to control this disease. The core ofHIV prevention is to abstain from sex until marriage, tobe faithful, and to use condoms. This is all good advicefor many women, but some simply do not have the eco-nomic and social power or choices or control over theirlives to put that advice into practice. Recognize that fact,and address the factors that will give women more con-trol over their lives by providing anticipatory guidance,giving ample opportunities to practice negotiation tech-niques and refusal skills in a safe environment, and en-couraging the use of female condoms to protect againstthis deadly virus. Prevention is the key to reversing thecurrent infection trends. Providing Care During Pregnancy and Childbirth Voluntary counseling and HIV testing should be offered to all pregnant women as early in the pregnancy as possibleto identify HIV-infected women so that treatment can beinitiated early. Once a pregnant woman is identied asbeing HIV-positive, she should be informed about the riskfor perinatal infection. Current evidence indicates that inthe absence of antiretroviral medications, 25% of infantsborn to HIV-infected mothers will become infected withHIV (CDC, 2007b). If women do receive a combinationof antiretroviral therapies during pregnancy, however, therisk of HIV transmission to the newborn drops below 2%(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease,2007a). In addition, HIV can be spread to the infantthrough breastfeeding, and thus all HIV-infected pregnantwomen should be counseled to avoid breastfeeding anduse formula instead. A recent maternal infection with HIVmay raise the risk of transmission through breastfeedingto twice that of a woman with earlier established infection, owing probably to the high viral load associated with re cent infection (WHO, 2007b).138 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN In addition, the woman needs instructions on ways to enhance her immune system by following these guide-lines during pregnancy: Getting adequate sleep each night (7 to 9 hours) Avoiding infections (e.g., staying out of crowds, handwashing) Decreasing stress in her life Consuming adequate protein and vitamins Increasing her fluid intake to 2 liters daily to stay hydrated Planning rest periods throughout the day to prevent fatigue Despite the dramatic reduction in perinatal transmis- sion, hundreds of infants will be born infected with HIV.The birth of each infected infant is a missed preventionopportunity. To minimize perinatal HIV transmission,identify HIV infection in women, preferably before preg-nancy; provide information about disease prevention; andencourage HIV-infected women to follow the prescribeddrug therapy. Providing Appropriate Referrals The HIV-infected woman may have difficulty copingwith the normal activities of daily living because she hasless energy and decreased physical endurance. She maybe overwhelmed by the financial burdens of medical anddrug therapies and the emotional responses to a life-threatening condition, as well as concern about her in-fant's future, if she is pregnant. A case managementapproach is needed to deal with the complexity of herneeds during this time. Be an empathetic listener andmake appropriate referrals for nutritional services, coun-seling, homemaker services, spiritual care, and local sup-port groups. Many community-based organizations havedeveloped programs to address the numerous issues re-garding HIV/AIDS. The national AIDS hotline (1-800-342-AIDS) is a good resource. Preventing Sexually Transmitted Infections Education about safer sex practices\u2014and the resulting increase in the use of condoms\u2014can play a vital role in re-ducing STI rates all over the world. Clearly, knowledge andprevention are the best defenses against STIs. The preven-tion and control of STIs is based on the following con cepts (CDC, 2006): 1. Education and counseling of persons at risk about safer sexual behavior 2. Identication of asymptomatic infected individuals and of symptomatic individuals unlikely to seek diagnosisand treatment 3. Effective diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 1384. Evaluation, treatment, and counseling of sex partners of people who are infected with an STI 5. Pre-exposure vaccination of people at risk for vaccine- preventable STIs Nurses play an integral role in identifying and pre- venting STIs. They have a unique opportunity to educatethe public about this serious public health issue by com-municating the methods of transmission and symptomsassociated with each condition, tracking the updated CDCtreatment guidelines, and offering clients strategic preven-tive measures to reduce the spread of STIs. It is not easy to discuss STI prevention when globally we are failing at it. Knowledge exists on how to preventevery single route of transmission, but the incidence con-tinues to climb. Challenges to prevention of STIs includelack of resources and difculty in changing the behaviorsthat contribute to their spread. Regardless of the challeng- ing factors involved, nurses must continue to educate andto meet the needs of all women to promote their sexualhealth. Successful treatment and prevention of STIs isimpossible without education. Successful teaching ap-proaches include giving clear, accurate messages that areage-appropriate and culturally sensitive. Primary prevention strategies include education of all women, especially adolescents, regarding the risk of earlysexual activity, the number of sexual partners, and STIs.Sexual abstinence is ideal but often not practiced; there-fore, the use of barrier contraception (condoms) should beencouraged (see Teaching Guidelines 5.1). Secondary prevention involves the need for annual pelvic examinations with Pap smears for all sexually ac-tive women, regardless of age. Many women with STIsare asymptomatic, so regular screening examinationsare paramount for early detection. Understanding therelationship between poor socioeconomic conditionsand poor patterns of sexual and reproductive self-care issignificant in disease-prevention and health-promotionstrategies. Every successful form of prevention requires a change in behavior. The nursing role in teaching and renderingquality health care is invaluable evidence that the key toreducing the spread of STIs is through behavioral change. Nurses working in these specialty areas have a responsibil-ity to educate themselves, their clients, their families, andthe community about STIs and to provide compassionateand supportive care to clients. Some strategies nurses canuse to prevent the spread of STIs are detailed in Box 5.3. Behavior Modication Research validates that changing behaviors does result ina decrease in new STI infections, but it must encompass alllevels\u2014governments, community organizations, schools,churches, parents, and individuals (Peterson et al., 2007). Education must address ways to prevent becoming in-fected, ways to prevent transmitting infection, symptomsCHAPTER 5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 139 of STIs, and treatment. At this point in the STI epi- demic, nurses do not have time to debate the relativemerits of prevention versus treatment: both are under-used and underfunded, and one leads to the other. Butbeing serious about prevention and focusing on the strate-gies outlined above will bring about a positive change on everyone's part. Contraception The spread of STIs could be prevented by access to safe,efcient, appropriate, modern contraception for everyonewho wants it. Nurses can play an important role in helpingwomen to identify their risk of STIs and to adopt preven-tive measures through the dual protection that contracep-tives offer. Traditionally, family planning and STI services have been separate entities. Family planning services haveaddressed a woman's need for contraception without con-sidering her or her partner's risk of STI; meanwhile, STIservices have been heavily slanted toward men, ignoringthe contraceptive needs of men and their partners. Many women are at signicant risk for unintended pregnancy and STIs, yet with this separation of services,there is limited evaluation of whether they need dualprotection\u2014that is, concurrent protection from STIs andunintended pregnancy. This lack of integration of serv ices represents a missed opportunity to identify many at-riskwomen and to offer them counseling on dual protection(Hogben, 2007).BOX 5.3 Selected Nursing Strategies to Prevent the Spread of STIs Provide basic information about STI transmission. Outline safer sexual behaviors for people at risk for STIs. Refer clients to appropriate community resources to reduce risk. Screen asymptomatic persons with STIs. Identify barriers to STI testing and remove them. Offer pre-exposure immunizations for vaccine- preventable STIs. Respond honestly about testing results and options available. Counsel and treat sexual partners of persons with STIs. Educate school administrators, parents, and teens about STIs. Support youth development activities to reduce sexual risk-taking. Promote the use of barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms) to prevent the spread of STIs. Assist clients to gain skills in negotiating safer sex. Discuss reducing the number of sexual partners to reduce risk11223-05_CH05.qxd 8/4/08 2:42 PM Page 139140 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Nurses can expand their scopes in either setting by discussing dual protection by use of a male or female con-dom alone or by use of a condom along with a nonbarriercontraceptive. Because barrier methods are not the mosteffective means of fertility control, they have not been typ-ically recommended as a method alone for dual protec tion. Unfortunately, the most effective pregnancy preventionmethods\u2014sterilization, hormonal methods, and in trauter- ine devices\u2014do not protect against STIs. Dual-method useprotects against STIs and pregnancy. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Avoiding risky sexual behaviors may preserve fertility and prevent chronic conditions later in life. /H18546An estimated 65 million people live with an incurable STI, and another 15 million are infected each year. /H18546The most reliable way to avoid transmission of STIs is to abstain from sexual intercourse (i.e., oral, vaginal,or anal sex) or to be in a long-term, mutually monog-amous relationship with an uninfected partner. /H18546Barrier methods of contraception are recommended because they increase protection from contact withurethral discharge, mucosal secretions, and lesions ofthe cervix or penis. /H18546The high rate of asymptomatic transmission of STIs calls for teaching high-risk women the nature of trans-mission and how to recognize infections. /H18546The CDC and ACOG recommend that all women be offered group B streptococcal screening by rectovagi-nal culture at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation, and that col-onized women be treated with intravenous antibioticsat the time of labor or ruptured membranes. /H18546Nurses should practice good handwashing techniques and follow standard precautions to protect themselvesand their patients from STIs. /H18546Nurses are in an important position to promote the sexual health of all women. Nurses should make theirclients and the community aware of the perinatal im-plications and life-long sequelae of STIs. REFERENCES Aaron, E., Levine, A. B., Monahan, K., & Biondo, C. P. (2006).

Women's breasts act as physicalmarkers for transitions from one stage of life to another,and although the primary function of the breasts is lactation, they are perceived as a symbol of beauty andsexuality. This chapter will discuss assessments, screening pro- cedures, and management of specic benign and malignantbreast disorders. Nurses play a key role in helping womenmaintain breast health by education and screening. A goodworking knowledge of early detection techniques, diagno-sis, and treatment options is essential. Benign Breast Disorders A benign breast disorder is any noncancerous breast abnormality. Though not life-threatening, benign disorderscan cause pain and discomfort, and they account for alarge number of visits to primary care providers. Depending on the type of benign breast disorder, treatment might or might not be necessary. Although thesedisorders are benign, the emotional trauma women expe-rience is phenomenal. Fear, anxiety, disbelief, helpless-ness, and depression are just a few of the reactions that awoman may have when she discovers a lump in her breast.Many women believe that all lumps are cancerous, but ac-tually more than 90% of the lumps discovered are benignand need no treatment (Alexander et al., 2007). Patience,support, and education are essential components of nurs-ing care.144 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN The most commonly encountered benign breast dis- orders in women include duct ectasia, and Although are considered benign, brocystic breasts and intraductal papillomas carrya cancer risk, with prolic masses and breasts. Generally speaking, fibroadenomas,mastitis, mammary duct little cancer 6-1 summarizesbenign breast conditions. FIBROCYSTIC BREAST CHANGES Fibrocystic breast changes do not refer to a disease; rather, they represent a variety of changes in the glandularand structural tissues of the breast. Because this conditionaffects many women at some point, it is more accuratelydened as a \"change\" rather than a \"disease.\" The causeof brocystic changes is related to the way breast tissueresponds to monthly levels of estrogen and progesterone.During the menstrual cycle, hormonal stimulation of thebreast tissue causes the glands and ducts to enlarge andswell. One or both breasts can be involved, and any partof the breast can become tender (Hackley, Kriebs, &Rousseau, 2007). Fibrocystic changes do not increasethe risk of breast cancer for most women except when thebreast biopsy shows \"atypia\" or abnormal breast cells. Thecause for concern for many women with brocystic changesis that breast examinations and mammography becomemore difcult to interpret with multiple cysts present,and early cancerous lesions that occur may occasionallybe overlooked (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2007a). Fibrocystic breast changes are most common in women between the ages of 30 and 50. The conditionis rare in postmenopausal women not taking hormonereplacement therapy. According to the ACS, brocysticbreast changes affect at least half of all women at somepoint in their lives and are the most common breast dis-order today (ACS, 2007a). Therapeutic Management Management of the symptoms of brocystic breast changes begins with self-care. In severe cases drugs, includingbromocriptine, tamoxifen, or danazol, can be used toreduce the influence of estrogen on breast tissue. How-ever, several undesirable side effects, including masculin-ization, have been documented. Aspiration or surgicalremoval of breast lumps will reduce pain and swelling byremoving the space-occupying mass. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment consists of a health history, physicalexamination, and laboratory and diagnostic tests.T Consider THIS! It was pouring down rain and I was driving alone along dark wet streets to my 8 a.m. appointment for a breastultrasound. I recently had my annual mammogramand the radiologist thought he saw something suspiciouson my right breast. I was on my way to conrm or re-fute his suspicions, and I couldn't keep focused on theroad ahead. For the past few days I had been a basketcase, fearing the worst. I was playing in my mind,what I would do if . . . ? What changes would I makein my life and how would I react when told? I havebeen through such personal turmoil since that doctorannounced he wanted \"more tests.\" Thoughts: This woman is worrying and is emotion- ally devastated before she even has a conclusive diag-nosis. Is this a typical reaction to a breast disorder?Why do women fear the worst? Many women use denial to mask their feelings and hope against hope thedoctor made a mistake or misread their mammogram.How would you react if you or your sister, girlfriend,or mother were confronted with a breast disorder? 11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 144Health History Ask the woman about common clinical manifestations, which include lumpy, tender breasts, particularly duringthe week before menses. Changes in breast tissue producepain by nerve irritation from edema in connective tissueand by brosis from nerve pinching. The pain is cyclic andfrequently dissipates after the onset of menses. The painis described as a dull, aching feeling of fullness. Masses ornodularities usually appear in both breasts and are oftenfound in the upper outer quadrants. Some women also ex-perience spontaneous clear to yellow nipple dischargewhen the breast is squeezed or manipulated. Physical Examination It is best to examine a woman's breast a week after menses, when swelling has subsided. Observe the breasts for bro-sis, or thickening of the normal breast tissues, which occursin the early stages. Cysts form in the later stages and feellike multiple, smooth, well-delineated tiny pebbles orbumpy oatmeal under the skin (Fig. 6.1). On physicalCHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 145 examination of the breasts, a few characteristics might be helpful in differentiating a cyst from a cancerous lesion.Cancerous lesions typically are fixed and painless andmay cause skin retraction (pulling). Cysts tend to be mo- bile and tender and do not cause skin retraction in the sur-rounding tissue. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Mammography can be helpful in distinguishing bro- cystic changes from breast cancer. Ultrasound is a usefuladjunct to mammography for breast evaluation because ithelps to differentiate a cystic mass from a solid one (Aliotta& Schaeffer, 2006). Ultrasound produces images of thebreasts by sending sound waves through a gel applied tothe breasts. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy can also be doneto differentiate a solid tumor, cyst, or malignancy. A ne-needle aspiration biopsy uses a thin needle guided by ultra-sound to the mass. In a method called stereotactic needlebiopsy, a computer maps the exact location of the massusing mammograms taken from two angles, and the mapis used to guide the Duct ectasia MastitisNipple Characteristics/ Diagnosis & Breast Condition Discharge Site Age of Client Tenderness Treatment +or + + Bilateral; upper outer quadrant Unilateral; nipple area or upperouter quadrant Unilateral; near nipple Unilateral; behind nipple Unilateral; outer quadrantRound, smooth Several lesionsCyclic, palpable30 to 50 years old Round, rm, movable Palpable, rubberyWell delineatedSingle lesion15 to 30 years old Small, wart-like Poorly delineatedNonpalpableCan become large40 to 60 years old Inflammation NonmobileBurning, women Mammogram UltrasoundCultureAntibioticsSurgical excision Antibiotics Warm showerSupportive braBreastfeedingIncrease fluidsTABLE 6.1 SUMMARY OF BENIGN BREAST DISORDERS Pectoralis FIGURE6.1(A) Fibrocystic breast ( B) Cysts.

They are consideredhyperplastic lesions associated with an aberration of nor-mal development and involution rather than a neoplasm.Fibroadenomas can be stimulated by external estrogen,progesterone, lactation, and pregnancy (Sukumvanich &Borgen, 2007). They are composed of both brous andglandular tissue and usually occur in women between20 and 40 years of age (Alexander et al., 2007). Giant bro-adenomas account for approximately 10% of cases. Thesemasses are frequently larger than 5 cm and occur mostoften in pregnant or lactating women. These large lesionsmay regress in size once hormonal stimulation subsides(Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Fibroadenomas arerarely associated with cancer. Therapeutic Management Treatment may include a period of \"watchful waiting\" be- cause many broadenomas stop growing or shrink on theirown without any treatment.

Avoid caffeine, which is a stimulant. This reducesdiscomfort for some women. Take oral contraceptives, as recommended by ahealth care practitioner, to stabilize the monthlyhormonal levels. Eat a low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, andgrains to maintain a healthy nutritional lifestyleand ideal weight. Apply heat to the breasts to help reduce pain viavasodilation of vessels. Take diuretics, as recommended by a health carepractitioner, to counteract fluid retention andswelling of the breasts. Reduce salt intake to reduce fluid retention andswelling in the breasts. Take OTC medications, such as aspirin or ibupro-fen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin), to reduce inflamma-tion and discomfort. Use thiamine and vitamin E therapy. This has beenfound helpful for some women, but research hasfailed to demonstrate a direct benet from eithertherapy. Take medications as prescribed (e.g., bromocriptine,tamoxifen, or danazol). Discuss the possibility of aspiration or surgical re-moval of breast lumps with a health care practitioner. Nursing Management A nurse caring for a woman with brocystic breast changes can teach her about the condition, provide tips for self-care (Teaching Guidelines 6.1), suggest lifestyle changes, and demonstrate how to perform monthly breast self-examination after her menses to monitor the changes.Nursing Care Plan 6.1 presents a plan of care for a woman with brocystic breast changes. FIBROADENOMAS Fibroadenomas are common benign solid breast tumors that occur in about 10% of all women and account for up11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 146surgically removed if they do not regress or if they remain unchanged. Cryoablation, an alternative to surgery, canalso be used to remove a tumor. In this procedure, ex-tremely cold gas is piped into the tumor using ultrasoundguidance. The tumor freezes and dies. The current trendis toward a more conservative approach to treatment aftercareful evaluation and continued monitoring. Nursing Assessment Ask the woman about clinical manifestations of fibro-adenomas. These lumps are felt as firm, rubbery, well-circumscribed, freely mobile nodules that might or might not be tender when palpated.CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 147 Breast broadenomas are usually detected inciden- tally during clinical or self-examinations and are usuallylocated in the upper outer quadrant of the breast; morethan one may be present (Fig. 6.2). Several other breastlesions have similar characteristics, so every woman with abreast mass should be evaluated to exclude cancer. A clin-ical breast examination by a health care professional iscritical. In addition, diagnostic studies include imagingstudies (mammography, ultrasound, or both) and someform of biopsy, most a fine-needle aspiration,core needle biopsy, or stereotactic needle biopsy. The core needle biopsy removes a small cylinder of tissue from thebreast mass, more than the ne-needle aspiration biopsy.Nursing Care Plan 6.1 OVERVIEW OF THE WOMAN WITHFIBROCYSTIC BREAST CHANGES Sheree Rollins is a 37-year-old woman who comes to the clinic for her routine check-up. During the examination, she says, \"Sometimes my breasts feel so heavy and they ache a lot. I noticed a couple of lumpy areas in my breast last week justbefore I got my period. Is this normal? Now they feel like they're almost gone. Should I be worried?\" Clinical breast examination reveals two small (pea-sized), mobile, slightly tender nodules in each breast bilaterally. No skin retractionnoted. Previous mammogram revealed fibrocystic breast changes. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Pain related to changes in breast tissue Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will demonstrate a decrease in breast pain as evidenced by a pain rating of 1 or 2 on a pain rating scale of 0 to 10 and statements that pain is lessened. Interventions: Relieving Pain Ask client to rate her pain using a numeric pain rating scale to establish a baseline. Discuss with client any measures used to relieve pain to determine effectiveness of the measures. Encourage use of a supportive bra to aid in reducing discomfort. Instruct client in use of over-the-counter analgesics to promote pain relief. Advise the client to apply warm compresses or allow warm water from the shower to flow over her breasts to promote vasodilation and subsequent pain relief. Tell client to reduce her intake of salt to reduce risk of fluid retention and swelling leading to increased pain. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Decient knowledge related to brocystic breast changes and appropriate care measures Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will verbalize understanding of condition as evidenced by statements about the cause of breast changes and appropriate choices for lifestyle changes, and demonstration of self-care measures. Interventions: Providing Patient Education Assess client's knowledge of brocystic breast changes to establish a baseline for teaching. Explain the role of monthly hormonal level changes and describe the signs and symptoms to promote understanding of this condition. Teach the client how to perform breast self-examination after her menstrual period to monitor for changes. Encourage client to report any changes promptly to ensure early detection of problems. Suggest client speak with her primary care provider about the use of oral contraceptives to help stabilize monthly hor- monal levels. Review lifestyle choices, such as avoiding caffeine, eating a low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and grains, and adheringto screening recommendations to promote health. Discuss measures for pain relief to minimize discomfort associated with breast changes.11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 147If additional tissue needs to be evaluated, the advanced breast biopsy instrument (ABBI) is used. This instrumentremoves a larger cylinder of tissue for examination by usinga rotating circular knife. The ABBI procedure removesmore tissue than any of the other methods except a surgi-cal biopsy (ACS, 2007b). Nursing Management The nurse should urge the client to return for re-evaluationin 6 months, perform monthly breast self-examinations,and return annually for a clinical breast examination. INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA An intraductal papilloma is a benign, wart-like growth found in the mammary ducts, usually near the nipple. Thisbenign growth is thought to be caused by a proliferationand overgrowth of ductal epithelial tissue. An intraduc-tal papilloma is generally less than 1 cm in diameter andmight not be palpable. It produces a spontaneous serous,serosanguineous, or watery nipple discharge (Graham, 2006). It mostly affects women between the ages of 40148 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN and 60. A single duct or several ducts may be involved. Women with solitary papilloma without atypia carry aminimal increase of developing breast cancer over thegeneral population. These women are not classied as highrisk. However, the risk of subsequent breast cancer isincreased by four- to fivefold in the presence of atypia (Sukumvanich & Borgen, 2007). Therapeutic Management Treatment consists of surgical removal of the papillomaand a part of the duct it is found in, usually through anincision at the edge of the areola. The excised papillomaand duct are sent to the pathology laboratory to rule outcancer (ACS, 2007a). Nursing Assessment The woman might report a feeling of fullness in the breast and may state that she can manually express a serous,serosanguineous, or watery discharge from the nipple.If the papilloma is large enough, it can be palpated inthe nipple area as a soft, nontender, mobile, poorly delin- eated mass. Laboratory and diagnostic testing is important to rule out cancer. The nipple discharge is evaluated forthe presence of occult blood using a Hemoccult card; a blue coloration on the card indicates the presence ofblood. In addition, a sample of the discharge may be sentfor cytologic evaluation to screen for cancer cells. Mam-mography, ultrasound, or ductography (radiographic dye is instilled into a duct; it outlines the breast ductalsystem on radiographs) is used to diagnose or differen-tiate this lesion from a cancerous one. An intraductalpapilloma appears as a smooth, lobulated filling defector a solitary obstructed duct on ductography (Aliotta &Schaeffer, 2006). Nursing Management The nurse should advise the woman to continuemonthly breast self-examinations and yearly clinicalbreast examinations. DUCT ECTASIA Duct ectasia is a dilation and inflammation of the ducts behind the nipple. It is most common in perimenopausalwomen. This benign condition frequently occurs in women who have breastfed their children. The cause is unclear;however, chronic periductal inflammation, brosis, andductal dilatation are associated factors. This condition pain, nipple retraction, This condition frequently improves without any specic treatment, or with warm compresses and antibiotics. Ifsymptoms persist, the abnormal duct is removed througha local incision at the border of the areola. The tissue issent to the pathology laboratory for evaluation. Nursing Assessment Assess the patient for clinical manifestations of duct ecta-sia. If the ducts have been chronically infected, an erythe-matous lesion will be present at the edge of the nipple area(ACS, 2007a). The woman may complain of nipple dis-charge, which can be green, brown, straw-colored, reddish,gray, or cream-colored, with the consistency of toothpaste.In addition, the woman may report a dull nipple pain, sub-areolar swelling, or a burning sensation accompanied bypruritus around the nipple (Richards et al., 2007). Physical examination of the breasts might reveal sub- areolar redness and swelling, with mild to moderate ten-derness on palpation. In addition, palpation will reveal thepresence of tortuous tubular swellings beneath the areola,along with nipple retraction and dimpling in some post-menopausal women (Graham, 2006). Diagnostic and lab-oratory testing includes mammography, ultrasound, andcytology and testing for occult blood on a nipple dischargesample, and ductography may be used to assist in thediagnosis of this lesion. Nursing Management The nurse should reassure the woman that this conditionis benign and should reinforce the importance of monthlyself-examinations as well as annual clinical breast exam-inations by the woman's health care provider. This be-nign breast condition is typically self-limiting; the onlyintervention needed is reassurance. MASTITIS Mastitis is an infection of the connective tissue in the breast that occurs primarily in lactating or engorgedwomen. Mastitis is divided into lactational or nonlacta-tional. The usual organisms for lactational Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Haemophilus and Streptococcus species, the source of which is the baby's flora. One or more of the ducts drain poorlyor become blocked, resulting in bacterial growth in theretained milk (Sukumvanich & Borgen, 2007). Nonlactational mastitis can be caused by duct ecta- sia, which occurs when the milk ducts become congestedwith secretions and debris, resulting in periductal inflam-mation. These women present with greenish nipple dis-charge, nipple retraction, and noncyclical pain.CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 149 Therapeutic Management Management of both types of mastitis involves the use of oral antibiotics (usually a penicillinase-resistant penicillinor cephalosporin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) for painand fever. Nursing Assessment Assess the patient's health history for risk factors for mas- titis, which include poor handwashing, ductal abnormali-ties, nipple cracks and ssures, lowered maternal defensesdue to fatigue, tight clothing, poor support of pendulousbreasts, failure to empty the breasts properly while breast-feeding, or missing breastfeedings. Assess the patient for clinical manifestations of masti- tis, which include flu-like symptoms of malaise, leuko-cytosis, fever, and chills. Physical examination of thebreasts reveals increased warmth, redness, tenderness, andswelling. The nipple is usually cracked or abraded andthe breast is distended with milk (Fig. 6.3). The diagnosis is made based on history and examination. Nursing Management Teach the woman about the etiology of mastitis andencourage her to continue to breastfeed, emphasizing thatthe prescribed medication is safe to take during lactation.Continued emptying of the breast or pumping improvesthe outcome, decreases the duration of symptoms, anddecreases the incidence of breast abscess. Thus, continuedbreastfeeding is recommended in the presence of mastitis(Reddy et al., 2007). Instructions for the woman with mas-titis are detailed in Teaching Guidelines 6.2.

It is the most common cancer in womenand the second leading cause of cancer deaths (lung can-cer is rst) among American women. Breast cancer ac-counts for one of every three cancers diagnosed in theUnited States (ACS, 2007c). A new case is discoveredevery 2 minutes. It is estimated that one out of every sevenwomen will develop the disease at some time during herlife, and the mortality rate of those with breast cancer is 1 in 30 (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2007b). Over 200,000 cases of invasive breast cancer are di- agnosed in the United States each year (ACS, 2007c).Breast cancer can also affect men, but only 1% of all indi-viduals diagnosed with breast cancer annually are men(ACS, 2007). Because men are not routinely screened forbreast cancer, the diagnosis is often delayed. The mostcommon clinical manifestation of male breast cancer is apainless, rm, subareolar breast mass. Any suspiciousbreast mass in a male should undergo diagnostic biopsy.If a malignancy is diagnosed, typical treatment is mastec-tomy with assessment of the axillary nodes. The cause of breast cancer, while not well understood, is thought to be a complex interaction between environ-ment, genetic, and hormonal factors. Breast cancer is aprogressive rather than a systemic disease, meaning thatmost cancers grow from small size with low metastatic po-tential to larger size and greater metastatic potential (Opatt& Chung, 2007). Pathophysiology Cancer is not just one disease, but rather a group of dis-eases that result from unregulated cell growth. Without150 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN regulation, cells divide and grow uncontrollably until they eventually form a tumor. Extensive research has deter-mined that all cancer is the result of changes in DNA orchromosome structure that cause the mutation of specicgenes. Most genetic mutations that cause cancer are ac-quired sporadically, which means they occur by chanceand are not necessarily due to inherited mutations (Law &Alcamo, 2007). Cancer development is thought to beclonal in nature, which means that each cell is derived fromanother cell. If one cell develops a mutation, any daughtercell derived from that cell will have that same mutation,and this process continues until a malignant tumor forms. Breast cancer starts in the epithelial cells that line the mammary ducts within the breast. The growth rate de-pends on hormonal influences, mainly estrogen and pro-gesterone. The two major categories of breast cancer arenoninvasive and invasive. Noninvasive, or in situ, breastcancers are those that have not extended beyond theirduct, lobule, or point of origin into the surrounding breasttissue. Conversely, invasive, or inltrating, breast cancershave extended into the surrounding breast tissue, with thepotential to metastasize. Many researchers believe thatmost invasive cancers probably originate as noninvasivecancers (Underwood, 2006). By far the most common breast cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma, which represents 85% of all cases(ACS, 2007f). Carcinoma is a malignant tumor that oc- curs in epithelial tissue; it tends to inltrate and give rise tometastases. The incidence of this cancer peaks in the sixthdecade of life (>60 years old). It spreads rapidly to axillaryand other lymph nodes, even while small. Infiltratingductal carcinoma may take various histologic forms\u2014well differentiated and slow-growing, poorly differentiatedand infiltrating, or highly malignant and undifferenti-ated with numerous metastases. This common type ofbreast cancer starts in the ducts, breaks through theduct wall, and invades the fatty breast tissue (Aliotta &Schaeffer, 2006). Invasive lobular carcinomas, which originate in the terminal lobular units of breast ducts, account for 10% to15% of all cases of breast cancer. The tumor is frequentlylocated in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, and bythe time it is discovered the prognosis is usually poor(Underwood, 2006). Other invasive types of cancer in-clude tubular carcinoma (29%), which is fairly uncommonand typically occurs in women aged 55 and older. Colloidcarcinoma (2% to 4%) occurs in women 60 to 70 yearsof age and is characterized by the presence of large poolsof mucus interspersed with small islands of tumor cells. Medullary carcinoma accounts for 5% to 7% of malignantbreast tumors; it occurs frequently in younger women(<50 years of age) and grows into large tumor masses.Inflammatory breast cancer (<4%) often presents withskin edema, redness, and warmth and is associated with apoor prognosis. Paget's disease (2% to 4%) originates inthe nipple with invasive ductal carci-noma (Sukumvanich & Borgen, 2007).TEACHING GUIDELINES 6.2 Caring for Mastitis Take medications as prescribed. Continue breastfeeding, as tolerated. Wear a supportive bra 24 hours a day to support the breasts. Increase fluid intake. Make sure infant is positioned correctly on the nipple. Practice good handwashing techniques. Apply warm compresses to the affected breast ortake a warm shower before breastfeeding. Frequently change positions while nursing. Get adequate rest and nutrition to support or improve the immune system. Sources: ACS, Page 150Breast cancer is considered to be a highly variable dis- ease. While the process of metastasis is a complex andpoorly understood phenomenon, there is evidence to sug-gest that new vascularization of the tumor plays an im-portant role in the biological aggressiveness of breastcancer (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau 2007). Breast can-cer metastasizes widely and to almost all organs of thebody, but primarily to the bone, lungs, lymph nodes, liver,and brain. The rst sites of metastases are usually local orregional, involving the chest wall or axillary supraclavicu-lar lymph nodes or bone (ACS, 2007f). Breast cancers are classied into three stages based on: 1. Tumor size 2. Extent of lymph node involvement3. Evidence of metastasis The purposes of tumor staging are to determine the probability the tumor has metastasized, to decide on anappropriate course of therapy, and to assess the client'sprognosis. Table 6.2 gives details and characteristics ofeach stage. The overall 10-year survival rate for a womanwith stage I breast cancer is 80% to 90%; for a woman with stage II, it is about 50%. The outlook is not as good forwomen with stage III or IV disease (Alexander et al., 2007). There is no completely accurate way to know whether the cancer has micrometastasized to distant organs, butcertain tests can help determine if the cancer has spread. Abone scan can be performed to assess the bones. Magneticresonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect metastasesto the liver, abdominal cavity, lungs, or brain. Risk Factors An estimated 80% of women in whom breast cancer de-velops have no documented risk factors (Sukumvanich &Borgen, 2007). Breast cancer is thought to develop in re-sponse to a number of related factors: aging, delayed child-bearing or never bearing children, high breast density,family history of cancer, late menopause, and hormonalfactors (ACS, 2007e). Other factors might contribute tobreast cancer but have not been scientically proven. In 1970, the lifetime risk for developing breast cancer was one in ten; since then, the risk has gradually risenCHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 151 (NCI, 2007b). This slight increase in incidence might be explained in a variety of ways\u2014better detection andscreening tools are available, which have identied morecases; women are living to an older age, when their risk increases; and lifestyle changes in American women (hav-ing their rst pregnancy at an older age, having fewer chil-dren, and using hormonal therapy to treat the symptoms ofmenopause) might have produced the higher numbers. Ageis a signicant risk factor. Because rates of breast cancerincrease with age, estimates of risk at specic ages are moremeaningful than estimates of lifetime risk. The estimatedchances of a woman being diagnosed with breast cancerbetween the ages of 30 and 70 are detailed in Table 6.3. Risk factors for breast cancer can be divided into those that cannot be changed (nonmodiable risk factors)and those that can be changed (modiable risk factors).Nonmodiable risk factors (ACS, 2007e) are: Gender (female) Aging (>50 years old) Genetic mutations (BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes) Personal history of ovarian or colon cancer Increased breast density Family history of breast cancer (mother, sister, daughter, grandmother, or aunt) Personal history of breast cancer (three- to fourfold increase in risk for recurrence) Race (higher in Caucasian women, but African-American women are more likely to die of it) Previous abnormal breast biopsy (atypical hyperplasia) Exposure to chest radiation (radiation damages DNA) Previous breast radiation (12 times normal risk) Early menarche (<12 years old) or late onset of menopause (>55 years old), which represents increasedestrogen exposure over the lifetime Modifiable risk factors related to lifestyle choices (ACS, 2007e) include: Not having children at all or not having children until after age 30\u2014this increases the risk of breast cancer bynot reducing the number of menstrual cycles Postmenopausal use of estrogens and progestins\u2014 the Women's Health Initiative study (2002) reportedincreased risks with long-term (>5 years) use of hormone replacement therapy 0 In situ, early type of breast cancer I Localized tumor <1 inch in diameterII Tumor 1-2 inches in diameter; spread to axillary lymph nodes III Tumor 2 inches or larger; spread to other lymph nodes and tissues IV Cancer has metastasized to other body organsStage CharacteristicsTABLE 6.2 STAGING OF BREAST CANCER Source: ACS, 2007c.Age 30 to 40 1 out of 262 Age 40 to 50 1 out of 68Age 50 to 60 1 out of 35Age 60 to 70 1 out of 27TABLE 6.3 ESTIMATED RISK OF BREAST CANCER ATSPECIFIC AGES Modied from National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Diagnostic tests mayinclude: Diagnostic mammography Magnetic resonance mammography lymph receptor status DNA ploidy status Cell proliferative indices HER-2/neu genetic marker (Opatt & Chung, 2007) Mammography Mammography involves taking x-ray pictures of the bare breasts while they are compressed between two plasticplates. This procedure is performed to identify and char-acterize a breast mass and to detect an early malignancy. Source: Prentice RL, Caan B, Chlebowski RT, et al. (2006). Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of inva- sive breast cancer: The Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modication Trial.JAMA, 295 (6), 629-642.The hypothesis that a low-fat diet can reduce breast can- cer risk has existed for decades but has never been testedin a controlled intervention trial. Study To assess the effects of a low-fat diet on breast cancer inci-dence, a randomized, controlled, primary prevention trialwas conducted at 40 U.S. clinical centers from 1993 to2005. A total of 48,835 postmenopausal women, aged 50to 79 years, without prior breast cancer, including 18.6% ofminority race/ethnicity, were enrolled. Women were dietary modication interventiongroup the comparison group (60% [n =29,294]). The intervention was designed to promote dietary change with the goals of reducing intake of total fatto 20% of energy and increasing consumption of vegeta-bles and fruit to at least ve servings daily and grains to atleast six servings daily. Comparison group participantswere not asked to make dietary changes. Dietary fat intake was signicantly lower in the dietary modication intervention group compared with the com-parison group. Vegetable and fruit consumption washigher in the intervention group by at least one serving perday and a smaller, more transient difference was found forgrain consumption.Findings The number of women who developed invasive breastcancer (annualized incidence rate) over the 8-year averagefollow-up period was 655 (0.42%) in the intervention groupand (0.45%) in the comparison (hazard ratio,0.91; 95% condence interval, 0.83-1.01 for the compari-son between the two groups). Secondary analyses sug-gested a lower hazard ratio among adherent women,provided greater evidence of risk reduction among womenwho ate a high-fat diet at baseline, and suggested a di-etary effect that varies by hormone receptor characteristicsof the tumor. Among postmenopausal women, a low-fatdiet did not result in a statistically signicant reduction ininvasive breast cancer risk over an 8-year average follow-up period. Nursing Implications Although the results didn't conrm that eating a low-fatdiet reduces the risk of breast cancer, nurses need tocounsel their patients about the other benets derivedfrom a low-fat diet: weight loss, lower cholesterol levels,and decreased risk for cardiovascular disease. These addi-tional benets should be emphasized as part of an overallhealthy lifestyle. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 6.1 Can a Low-Fat Diet Reduce Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Women?11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 PM Page 152A B A top-to-bottom view of the breast. ( B) A side view of the breast.A screening mammogram typically consists of four views, two per breast (Fig. 6.4). It can detect lesions as small as0.5 cm (the average size of a tumor detected by a womanpracticing occasional breast self-examination is approxi-mately 2.5 cm) (Kubota et al., 2007). A diagnostic mam-mogram is performed when the woman has suspiciousclinical ndings on a breast examination or an abnormal-ity has been found on a screening mammogram. A diag-nostic mammogram uses additional views of the affectedbreast as well as magnication views. Diagnostic mam-mography provides the radiologist with additional detail torender a more specic diagnosis. A digital mammography,which records images in computer code instead of on x-raylm, can also be used so that images can be transmittedand easily stored. Most women nd the 10-minute mammography pro- cedure uncomfortable but not painful. Teaching Guide-lines 6.3 offers tips for a patient to follow before sheundergoes this procedure. Magnetic Resonance Mammography MRM is a relatively new procedure that might allow forearlier detection because it can detect smaller lesions andprovide finer detail. MRM is a highly accurate (>90%CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 153 sensitivity for invasive carcinoma) but costly tool. Con- trast infusion is used to evaluate the rate at which the dyeinitially enters the breast tissue. The basis of the highsensitivity of MRM is the tumor angiogenesis (vesselgrowth) that accompanies a majority of breast cancers,even early ones. Malignant lesions tend to exhibit increasedenhancement within the first 2 minutes (Preda et al.,2006). Currently MRM is used only as a complement tomammography and clinical breast examination becauseit is expensive, but it may move into the diagnostic arena in the near fu ture (Smith, 2007). Fine-Needle Aspiration Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is done to identify a solid tumor, cyst, or malignancy. It is a simple ofce procedurethat can be performed with or without anesthesia. A small(20- to 22-gauge) needle connected to a 10-cc or largersyringe is inserted into the breast mass and suction isapplied to withdraw the contents. The aspirate is thensent to the cytology laboratory to be evaluated for abnor-mal cells. Stereotactic Needle-Guided Biopsy This diagnostic tool is used to target and identify mammo-graphically detected nonpalpable lesions in the breast. Thisprocedure is less expensive than an excisional biopsy. Theprocedure takes place in a specially equipped room andgenerally takes about an hour. When proper placement ofthe breast mass is conrmed by digital mammograms, thebreast is locally anesthetized and a spring-loaded biopsygun is used to obtain two or three core biopsy tissue sam-ples. After the procedure is nished, the biopsy area iscleaned and a sterile dressing is applied. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy The status of the axillary lymph nodes is an importantprognostic indicator in early-stage breast cancer. The pres-TEACHING GUIDELINES 6.3 Preparing for a Screening Mammogram Schedule the procedure just after menses, when breasts are less tender. Don't use deodorant or powder the day of the pro-cedure, because they can appear on the x-ray lmas calcium spots. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin can relieve anydiscomfort after the procedure. Remove all jewelry from around your neck, becausethe metal can cause distortions on the lm image. Select a facility that is accredited by the AmericanCollege of Radiology (ACR) to ensure appropriatecredentialed staff. 11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 153ence or absence of malignant cells in lymph nodes is highly signicant: the more lymph nodes involved and the moreaggressive the cancer, the more powerful chemotherapywill have to be, both in terms of the toxicity of drugsand the duration of treatment (Teal, Tabbara, & Kelly, 2007). With a sentinel lymph node biopsy, the clinician candetermine whether breast cancer has spread to the axil-lary lymph nodes without having to do a traditional ax- illary lymph node dissection. Experience has shownthat the lymph ducts of the breast typically drain to onelymph node f irst before draining through the rest of the lymph nodes under the arm. The rst lymph node iscalled the sentinel lymph node. This procedure can be performed under local anes- thesia. A radioactive blue dye is injected 2 hours before thebiopsy to identify the afferent sentinel lymph node. Thesurgeon usually removes one to three nodes and sendsthem to the pathologist to determine whether cancer cellsare present. The sentinel lymph node biopsy is usually per-formed before a lumpectomy to make sure the cancer hasnot spread. Removing only the sentinel lymph node canallow women with breast cancer to avoid many of the sideeffects (lymphedema) associated with a traditional axillarylymph node dissection (Underwood, 2006). Hormone Receptor Status Normal breast epithelium has hormone receptors and re-sponds specically to the stimulatory effects of estrogenand progesterone. Most breast cancers retain estrogenreceptors, and for those tumors estrogen will retain prolif-erative control over the malignant cells. It is therefore use-ful to know the hormone receptor status of the cancer topredict which women will respond to hormone manipula-tion. Hormone receptor status reveals whether the tumor isstimulated to grow by estrogen and progesterone. Tumorsthat have estrogen receptors are said to be \"ER positive\"(ER +) and tumors that do not have estrogen receptors are \"ER negative\" (ER ). The same terminology applies to progesterone (PR +or PR ). ER +and PR +tumors have a better than 75% response to endocrine therapy in compar-ison to tumors that are ER +and PR , whose response rate is under 35%. Postmenopausal women tend to be ER +; premenopausal women tend to be ER (Opatt & Chung, 2007). To determine hormone receptor status, a sample ofbreast cancer tissue obtained during a biopsy or a tumorremoved surgically during a lumpectomy or mastectomy isexamined by a cytologist. DNA Ploidy Status DNA ploidy status, which correlates with tumor aggres- siveness, indicates the amount of DNA in cancer cells.Cancer cells that have the correct amount of DNA(diploid) in contrast with too much or too little DNA (ane-uploid) tend not to spread. An aneuploid DNA patterndenotes a greater tendency to metastasize than a diploidone (Sukumvanich & Borgen, 2007). A sample of breastcancer tissue obtained during a biopsy or a tumor removed154 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN surgically during a lumpectomy or mastectomy is exam- ined for abnormal amounts of DNA. Using flow cytome-try (process of counting and measuring cells), it is possibleto measure the DNA content and proliferative activity of atumor. The number of chromosome sets in the nucleus in-dicates the speed of cell replication and tumor growth; ahigh number predicts a poor outcome. Cell Proliferative Indices Research indicates that cell proliferation potential may have prognostic signicance. Cell proliferative indices indirectlymeasure the rate of cell division, which is an indication ofhow fast the cancer is growing. Flow and image cytometrytechniques are used to measure the tumor's cell cycle rate.The percentage of tumor cells in S phase (synthesis stage ofcell division) of the cell cycle is assessed. S-phase percent-ages below 10% are considered low, and the tumor has lessof a chance of spreading than one with a higher percentage.A tumor with high proliferative activity has a more aggres-sive metastatic potential (ACS, 2007f). HER-2/neu Genetic Marker Molecular and biologic factors are increasingly being used as indicators for prognosis and treatment. HER-2 isa human epidermal growth factor receptor whose biolog-ical function is associated with cell growth, resulting inloss of cell regulation and uncontrolled cell proliferation. HER-2/neu oncoprotein is a protein that is signicant, especially in large tumors. Overexpression of this proteinresults from an acquired genetic mutation and occurs inapproximately 30% of women with metastatic breast can-cer. Women whose tumors have high levels of HER-2/neuoncoprotein have a poor prognosis: they have rapid tumorprogression, an increased rate of recurrence, a poor re-sponse to standard therapies, and a lower survival rate(Chernecky & Berger, 2007). The presence or absence ofthis oncoprotein helps determine which chemotherapytreatment will be most effective. A breast tissue sample isobtained by a ne-needle or open biopsy and treated witha material that binds to HER-2/neu oncoprotein. A dye isadded to the tissue sample: the more uptake of the dye, thehigher amount present (Chernecky & Berger, 2007). Therapeutic Management Women diagnosed with breast cancer have many treat- ments available to them. Generally, treatments fall intotwo categories: local and systemic. Local treatments aresurgery and radiation therapy. Effective systemic treat-ments include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, andimmunotherapy. Treatment plans are based on multiple factors, primar- ily on whether the cancer is invasive or noninvasive, thetumor's size and grade, the number of cancerous axillarylymph nodes, the hormone receptor status, and the abilityto obtain clear surgical margins (ACS, 2007f). A combi-nation of surgical options and adjunctive therapy is oftenrecommended.11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 154Another consideration in making decisions about a treatment plan is genetic testing for BRCA-1 andBRCA-2. This genetic testing became available in 1995and can pinpoint women who have a signicantly in creased risk for breast and ovarian cancer: individuals withBRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations have a 75% lifetimerisk of breast cancer and a 30% lifetime risk of ovariancancer. Most cases of breast and ovarian cancer are spo-radic in nature, but approximately 7% of breast cancersand 10% of ovarian cancers are thought to result fromgenetic inheritance (Kell & Burke, 2007). Testing positive for a BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutation can signicantly alter health care decisions. In some cases,before genetic testing was available, lumpectomy withradiation or mastectomy was the treatment most oftenrecommended. However, if the woman is found to havea BRCA-1 mutation, she is most likely to be offered theoption of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and pos-sible bilateral oophorectomy (Kell & Burke, 2007). Severe psychological distress can occur as a result of genetic testing. Also, many women perceive their breastsas intrinsic to their femininity, self-esteem, and sexuality,and the risk of losing a breast can provoke extreme anxi-ety (Alexander et al., 2007). Nurses need to address thephysical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the womenthey care for, as well as their families, since this muta-tion is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Basedon Mendelian genetics, rst-degree relatives of affectedwomen have a 50% risk of having inherited the mutation(Kell & Burke, 2007). Surgical Options Generally, the rst treatment option for the woman diag- nosed with breast cancer is surgery. A few women withtumors larger than 5 cm or inflammatory breast cancermay undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapyto shrink the tumor before surgical removal is attempted(Opatt & Chung, 2007). The surgical options depend onthe type and extent of cancer. The choices are typicallyeither breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy with radi-ation) or mastectomy with or without reconstruction. Theoverall survival rate with lumpectomy and radiation isabout the same as that with modied radical mastectomy(ACS, 2007f). Research has shown that the survival ratesin women who have had mastectomies versus those whohave undergone breast-conserving surgery followed byradiation are the same. However, lumpectomy may not bean option for some women, including those: Who have two or more cancer sites that cannot be removed through one incision Whose surgery will not result in a clean margin of tissue Who have active connective tissue conditions (lupus or scleroderma) that make body tissues especially sensitive to the side effects of radiation Who have had previous radiation to the affected breast Whose tumors are larger than 5 cm (2 inches) (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2007)CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 155 These decisions are made jointly between the woman and her surgeon. If mastectomy is chosen, either by tumorcharacteristics or patient preference, then discussionneeds to include breast reconstruction and regional lymphnode biopsy versus sentinel lymph node biopsy. The mas-tectomy techniques are a simple mastectomy with sentinelnode biopsy or a radical mastectomy with regional nodebiopsy. Removal of numerous lymph nodes places thepatient at high risk for lymphedema. Breast-Conserving Surgery Breast-conserving surgery , the least invasive procedure, is the wide local excision (or lumpectomy) of the tumoralong with a 1-cm margin of normal tissue. A lumpectomyis often used for early-stage localized tumors. The goalof breast-conserving surgery is to remove the suspiciousmass along with tissue free of malignant cells to preventrecurrence. The results are less drastic and emotionallyless scarring to the woman. Women undergoing breast-conserving therapy receive radiation after lumpectomywith the goal of eradicating residual microscopic cancercells to limit locoregional recurrence. In women who donot require adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapytypically begins 2 to 4 weeks after surgery to allow heal-ing of the lumpectomy incision site. Radiation is admin-istered to the entire breast at daily doses over a period ofseveral weeks (Rao et al., 2007). A sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed since the lymph nodes draining the breast are located pri-marily in the axilla. Theoretically, if breast cancer is tometastasize to other parts of the body, it will probably do sovia the lymphatic system. If malignant cells are found in thenodes, more aggressive systemic treatment may be needed. Mastectomy A simple mastectomy is the removal of all breast tissue, the nipple, and the areola. The axillary nodes and pectoralmuscles are spared. This procedure would be used for alarge tumor or multiple tumors that have not metastasizedto adjacent structures or the lymph system. A modied radical mastectomy is another surgical option; survival rates are comparable to those of radicalmastectomy, but it is more conducive to breast reconstruc-tion and results in greater mobility and less lymphedema(Alexander et al., 2007). This procedure involves removalof breast tissue, the axillary nodes, and some chest mus-cles, but not the pectoralis major, thus avoiding a concaveanterior chest (DiSaia & Creasman, 2007). In conjunction with the mastectomy, lymph node sur- gery (removal of underarm nodes) may need to be doneto reduce the risk of distant metastasis and improve awoman's chance of long-term survival. For women with apositive sentinel node biopsy, 10 to 20 underarm lymphnodes may need to be removed. Complications associatedwith axillary lymph node surgery include nerve damageduring surgery, causing temporary numbness down theupper aspect of the arm; seroma formation followed bywound infection; restrictions in 8/4/08 2:44 Page 155need physiotherapy); and lymphedema. In many women lymphedema can be avoided by: Avoiding using the affected arm for drawing blood, inserting intravenous lines, or measuring blood pres-sure (can cause trauma and possible infection) Seeking medical care immediately if the affected arm swells Wearing gloves when engaging in activities such as gardening that might cause injury Wearing a well-tted compression sleeve to promote drainage return Women having mastectomies must decide whether to have further surgery to reconstruct the breast. If thewoman decides to have reconstructive surgery, it ideally isperformed immediately after the mastectomy. The womanmust also determine whether she wants the surgeon touse saline implants or natural tissue from her abdomen(TRAM flap method) or back (LAT flap method). In the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap method, the rectus abdominis muscle istransferred from the abdomen via a tunnel under the skinand brought out through a new excision in the breast area.The blood supply is maintained. This tissue is used toreconstruct the breast that has been removed. In the latis-simus dorsi (LAT) flap method, tissue from the latissimusdorsi muscle in the upper back is tunneled subcutaneouslyup to the chest area. If reconstructive surgery is desired, the ultimate decision regarding the method will be determined by the woman's anatomy (e.g., is there sufficient fat andmuscle to permit natural reconstruction) and her over-all health status. Both procedures require a prolongedrecovery period. Some women opt for no reconstruction, and many of them choose to wear breast prostheses. Some prosthesesare worn in the bra cup and others t against the skin orinto special pockets made into clothing. Whether to have reconstructive surgery is an individ- ual and very complex decision. Each woman must be pre-sented with all of the options and then allowed to decide.The nurse can play an important role here by presentingthe facts to the woman so that she can make an intelligentdecision to meet her unique situation. Adjunctive Therapy Adjunctive therapy is supportive or additional therapy that is recommended after surgery. Adjunctive therapiesinclude local therapy such as radiation therapy and sys-temic therapies using chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,and immunotherapy. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to destroy can-cer cells that might have been left behind in the breast,chest wall, or underarm area after the tumor has been re-moved surgically. Usually serial radiation doses are given156 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN 5 days a week to the tumor site for 6 to 8 weeks post- operatively. Each treatment takes only a few minutes, but the dose is cumulative. Women undergoing breast-conserving therapy receive radiation to the entire breastafter lumpectomy with the goal of eradicating residualmicroscopic cancer cells to reduce the chance of recur-rence (Holcomb, 2006). Side effects of traditional radiation therapy include inflammation, local edema, anorexia, swelling, and heavi- ness in the breast; sunburn-like skin changes in the treatedarea; and fatigue. Changes to the breast tissue and skinusually resolve in about a year (Willett, Czito, & Tyler,2007). This type of therapy can be given several ways:external beam radiation, which delivers a carefully focuseddose of radiation from a machine outside the body, orinternal radiation, in which tiny pellets that contain radio-active material are placed into the tumor. Several advances have taken place in the field of radiation oncology for the treatment of women withearly-stage breast cancer that assist in reducing the sideeffects. The treatment position for external radiationhas changed from supine to prone, with the arm on theaffected side raised above the head, so that the treatedbreast hangs dependently through the opening of thetreatment board. Treatment in the prone position im-proves dose distribution within the breast and allowsfor a decrease in the dose delivered to the heart, lung,chest wall, and other breast (National ComprehensiveCancer Network, 2007). High-dose brachytherapy is another advance that is an alternative to traditional radiation treatment. A ballooncatheter is used to insert radioactive seeds into the breastafter the tumor is removed surgically. The seeds deliver aconcentrated dose directly to the operative site; this isimportant because most cancer recurrences in the breast(67% to 100%) occur at or near the lumpectomy site. Thisallows a high dose of radiation to be delivered to a smalltarget volume with a minimal dose to the surrounding nor-mal tissue. This procedure takes 4 to 5 days as opposed tothe 4 to 6 weeks that traditional radiation therapy takes; italso eliminates the need to delay radiation therapy to allowfor wound healing. Brachytherapy is now used as a primaryradiation treatment after breast-conserving surgery inselected women as an alternative to whole breast irradia-tion (Sanders et al., 2007). Side effects of brachytherapyinclude redness or discharge around catheters, fever, andinfection. Daily cleansing of the catheter insertion site witha mild soap and application of an antibiotic ointment willminimize the risk of infection. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) offers still another new approach to the delivery of treatmentto reduce the dose within the target area while sparing sur-rounding normal structures. A computed tomography scanis used to create a three-dimensional model of the breast.Based on this model, a series of intensity-modulatedbeams are produced to the desired dose distribution to11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 156reduce radiation exposure to underlying structures. Acute toxicity is thus minimized (Willett, Czito, & Tyler, 2007).Research is ongoing to evaluate the impact of all of theseadvances in radiation therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy refers to the use of drugs that are toxic to all cells and interfere with a cell's ability to reproduce.They are particularly effective against malignant cells butaffect all rapidly dividing cells, especially those of the skin,the hair follicles, the mouth, the gastrointestinal tract, andthe bone marrow. Breast cancer is a systemic disease inwhich micrometastases are already present in other organsby the time the breast cancer is diagnosed. Chemothera-peutic agents perform a systemic \"sweep\" of the body toreduce the chances that distant tumors will start growing. Chemotherapy may be indicated for women with tu- mors larger than 1 cm, positive lymph nodes, or cancer ofan aggressive type. Chemotherapy is prescribed in cycles,with each period of treatment followed by a rest period.Treatment typically lasts 3 to 6 months, depending on thedose used and the woman's health status. Different classes of drugs affect different aspects of cell division and are used in combinations or \"cocktails.\" Themost active and commonly used chemotherapeutic agentsfor breast cancer include alkylating agents, anthracyclines,antimetabolites, and vinca alkaloids. Fifty or more chemo-therapeutic agents can be used to treat breast cancer; how-ever, a combination drug approach versus a single drugtreatment appears to be more effective (ACS, 2007f). Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the agents used, the intensity of dosage, the dosage schedule, the typeand extent of cancer, and the client's physical and emo-tional status (Boehmke & Dickerson, 2006). However,typical side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrheaor constipation, hair loss, weight loss, stomatitis, fatigue,and immunosuppression. The most serious is bone marrowsuppression (myelosuppression). This causes an increasedrisk of infection, bleeding, and a reduced red-cell count,which can lead to anemia. Treatment of the side effects cangenerally be addressed through appropriate support med-ications such as antinausea like granisetron hydro-chloride alfa (Pr ocrit) and lgrastim (Neupogen), help keep blood counts fromdropping too low. Counts that are too low would stop ordelay the use of chemotherapy. An aggressive systemic option, when other treatments have failed or when there is a strong possibility of relapseor metastatic disease, is high-dose chemotherapy with bonemarrow and/or stem cell transplant. This therapy involvesthe withdrawal of bone marrow before the administrationof toxic levels of chemotherapeutic agents. The marrow isfrozen and then returned to the client after the high-dosechemotherapy is nished. Clinical trials are still research-ing this experimental therapy (Guarneri et al., 2007).CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 157 Endocrine Therapy One of estrogen's normal functions is to stimulate thegrowth and division of healthy cells in the breasts. How-ever, in some women with breast cancer, this normal func-tion contributes to the growth and division of cancer cells. The objective of endocrine therapy is to block or counter the effect of estrogen. Estrogen plays a centralrole in the pathogenesis of cancer, and treatment with estrogen deprivation has proven to be effective (Bush,2007). Several different drug classes are used to interfere orblock estrogen receptors. They include Current recommenda tions for most women with ER +breast cancer are to take a hormone-like medication\u2014known as a SERM anti-estrogenic agent\u2014daily for up to 5 years after initial treat-ment. Certain areas in the female body (breasts, uterus,ovaries, skin, vagina, and brain) contain specialized cellscalled hormone receptors that allow estrogen to enter thecell and stimulate it to divide. SERMs enter these samereceptors and act like keys, turning off the signal forgrowth inside the cell (Bush, 2007). The best-knownSERM is tamoxifen (Nolvadex, 20 mg daily for 5 years).Although it works well in preventing further spread ofcancer, it is also associated with an increased incidenceof endometrial cancer, pulmonary embolus, deep veinthrombosis, hot flashes, vaginal discharge and bleeding,stroke, and cataract formation (Bush, 2007). A relatively new SERM is the anti-osteoporosis drug raloxifene (Evista), which has shown promising results. Ithas anti-estrogen effects on the breast and uterus. In a re-cent study involving more than 20,000 postmenopausalwomen at high risk for breast cancer, raloxifene worked aswell as tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer, but withfewer serious adverse effects. Both drugs cut the cancerrisk in half (Medical Letter, 2006). It was originally mar-keted solely for the prevention and treatment of osteoporo-sis but is now used as adjunctive breast cancer therapy. Another class of endocrine agents, aromatase in- hibitors, work by inhibiting the conversion of androgens Aromatase inhibitors include letozole 25 mg daily), andanastrozole (Arimidex, 1 mg daily for 5 years), all of whichare taken orally. These are usually given to women withadvanced breast cancer or cancer that recurs despite theuse of tamoxifen (Holcomb, 2006). The side effects associated with these endocrine therapies include hot flashes, bone pain, fatigue, nausea, cough, dyspnea, and headache (Hackley, Kriebs, &Rousseau, 2007). Women with hormone-sensitive cancerscan live for long periods without any intervention otherthan hormonal manipulation, but quality-of-life issuesneed to be addressed in the balance between treatment andside effects.11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 157Immunotherapy Immunotherapy, used as an adjunct to surgery, represents an attempt to stimulate the body's natural defenses to rec-ognize and attack cancer cells. Trastuzumab (Herceptin,2- to 4-mg/kg intravenous infusion) is the rst monoclonalantibody approved for breast cancer (National Compre-hensive Cancer Network, 2007). Some tumors produceexcessive amounts of HER-2/neu protein, which regulatescancer cell growth. Breast cancers that overexpress theprotein HER-2/neu are associated with a more aggressiveform of disease and a poorer prognosis. Trastuzumabblocks the effect of this protein to inhibit the growth of can-cer cells. It can be used alone or in combination with otherchemotherapy to treat clients with metastatic breast disease(Opatt & Chung, 2007). Adverse effects of trastuzumabinclude cardiac toxicity, vascular thrombosis, hepatic fail-ure, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and pain with rst in-fusion (Skidmore-Roth, 2007). NURSING PROCESS FOR THE PATIENT WITHBREAST CANCER When a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, she facestreatment that may alter her body shape, may make her feelunwell, and may not carry a certainty of cure. Nurses cansupport women from the time of diagnosis, through thetreatments, and through follow-up after the surgical andadjunctive treatments have been completed. Allowing pa-tients time to ask questions and to discuss any necessarypreparations for treatment is critical. As our understandingof breast disorders keeps improving, treatments continue tochange. Although the goal of treatment remains improvedsurvival, increasing emphasis is focused on prevention(Stephenson, 2007). Nurses can have an impact on earlydetection of breast disorders, treatment, and symptommanagement (Underwood, 2006). A nurse who is involvedin the woman's treatment plan from the beginning can ef-fectively offer support throughout the whole experience. Teamwork is important in breast screening and caring for women with breast disorders. Treatment is often frag-mented between the hospital and community treatmentcenters, which can be emotionally traumatic for the womanand her family. The advances being made in the diagnosisand treatment of breast disorders mean that guidelines areconstantly changing, requiring all health care professionalsto keep up to date. Informed nurses can provide supportand information and, most importantly, continuity of carefor the woman undergoing treatment for a breast problem. The nurse plays a particularly important role in pro- viding psychological support and self-care teaching to patients with breast cancer. Nurses can influence bothphysical and emotional recovery, which are both importantaspects of care that help in improving the woman's qualityof life and the ability to survive. The nurse's role should ex-158 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN tend beyond helping clients; spreading the word in the community about screening and prevention is a big part inthe ongoing ght against cancer. The community shouldsee nurses as both educators and valued sources of credibleinformation. This role will help improve clinical outcomeswhile achieving high levels of client satisfaction. Remember Nancy from the chapter opener? Is her response typical of many women upon discovering a lump in theirbreast? Nancy condes her discovery of the lump and herworries to you. What advice would you give her? Assessment Early breast cancer has no symptoms. The earliest sign of breast cancer is often an abnormality seen on a screeningmammogram before the woman or the health care pro-fessional feels it. In the woman presenting with a breastdisorder, take a thorough history of the problem and ex-plore the woman's risk factors for breast cancer. Assessthe woman for clinical manifestations of breast cancer,such as changes in breast appearance and contour, whichbecome apparent with advancing breast cancer (ACS,2007d). These changes include: Continued and persistent changes in the breast A lump or thickening in one breast Persistent nipple irritation Unusual breast swelling or asymmetry A lump or swelling in the axilla Changes in skin color or texture Nipple retraction, tenderness, or discharge (Fig. 6.5) Hard Irregularly shapedImmobile, fixed to chest wallSkin dimpling Nipple tumor.11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 158Complete a breast examination to validate the clinical manifestations and ndings of the health history and risk factor assessment. The clinical breast examination involves both inspection and palpation (Nursing Procedure 6.1). Helpful characteristics in evaluating palpable breast massesare described in Box 6.1. If a lump can be palpated, the can-cer has been there for quite some time. Be cognizant of the impact that breast cancer has on a woman's emotional state, coping ability, and quality of life. Women may experience sadness, anger, fear, and guilt asa result of breast cancer. However, despite potential nega-tive outcomes, many women have a positive outlook fortheir futures and adapt to treatment modalities with a goodquality of life (Holcomb, 2006). Closely monitor clients for their psychosocial adjustment to diagnosis and treat- ment and be able to identify those who need further psy-chological intervention. By giving practical advice, thenurse can help the woman adjust to her altered body imageand to accept the changes to her life. Because family members play a signicant role in sup- porting women through breast cancer diagnosis and treat-ment, assess the emotional distress of both partners duringthe course of treatment and, if needed, make a referralfor psychological counseling. By identifying interpersonalstrains, negative psychosocial side effects of cancer treat-ment can be minimized. Nursing Diagnosis Appropriate nursing diagnoses for a woman with a diag- nosis of breast cancer might include: Disturbed body image related to: Loss of body part (breast) Loss of femininity Loss of hair due to chemotherapy Fear related to: Diagnosis of cancer Prognosis of disease Educational decit related to: Cancer treatment options Reconstructive surgery decisions Breast self-examination Nursing Interventions Offer information, support, and perioperative care to women diagnosed with breast cancer who are undergo-ing treatment. Implement health-promotion and disease- prevention strategies to minimize the risk for developing breast cancer and to promote optimal outcomes. Remember Nancy, who discovered a breast lump? You offer to go with her to the doctor. After a full examination and several diagnostic tests, the results come back positive for breast cancer. What treatment options does Nancy have, and what factors need to be considered in selectingthose options?CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 159 Providing Patient Education Help the woman and her partner to prioritize the volumi- nous amount of information given to them so that they canmake informed decisions. Explain all treatment options in detail so the patient and her family understand them. By preparing an individualized packet of information and re-viewing it with the woman and her partner, the nurse canhelp them understand her specic type of cancer, the diag- nostic studies and treatment options she may choose, and the goals of treatment. For example, nurses play an impor-tant role in educating women about the use of endocrinetherapies, observing women's experiences with treatment,and communicating those observations to their primarycare professionals to make dosage adjustments, in addition to contributing to the knowledge base of endocrine ther- apy in the treatment of breast cancer. Providing information is a central role of the nurse in caring for the woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer.This information can be given via telephone counseling,one-to-one contact, and pamphlets. Telephone counsel-ing with women and their partners may be an effectivemethod to improve symptom management and quality oflife (Knobf, 2007). Providing Emotional Support The diagnosis of cancer affects all aspects of life for a woman and her family. The threatening nature of the dis-ease and feelings of uncertainty about the future can lead to anxiety and stress. Address the woman's needs for: Information about diagnosis and treatment Physical care while undergoing treatments Contact with supportive people Education about disease, options, and prevention measures Discussion and support by a caring, competent nurse Reassure the client and her family that the diagnosis of breast cancer does not necessarily mean imminent death, a decrease in attractiveness, or diminished sexual-ity. Encourage the woman to express her fears and worries.Be available to listen and address the woman's concerns inan open manner to help her toward recovery. All aspectsof care must include sensitivity to the patient's personalefforts to cope and heal. Some women will becomeinvolved in organizations or charities that support cancerresearch; they may participate in breast cancer walks toraise awareness or become a Reach for Recovery volunteerto help others. Each woman copes in her own personalmanner, and all of these efforts can be positive motivatorsfor her own healing. To help women cope with the diagnosis of breast cancer, the American Cancer Society launched Reach to Recovery more than 30 years ago. Specially trained breast cancer survivors give women and their families opportu-nities to express their feelings, verbalize their fears, andget answers. Most importantly, Reach to Recovery vol- (text continues on page 162)11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/14/08 12:08 PM Page 159160 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Nursing Procedure 6.1 CLINICAL BREAST EXAMINATION Purpose: To Assess Breasts for Abnormal Findings 1. Inspect the breast for size, symmetry, and skin texture and color. Inspect the nipples and areola. Ask the clientto sit at the edge of the examination table, with herarms resting at her sides. The client then stands, places her hands on her hips, and leans forward. 2. Inspect the breast for masses, retraction, dimpling, or ecchymosis. The client places her hands on her hips. She then raises her arms over her head so the axillae can also be inspected. 3. Palpate the breasts. Assist the client into a supine posi- tion with her arms above her head. Place a pillow ortowel under the client's head to help spread the breasts.Three patterns might be used to palpate the breasts: Spiral 11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 160CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 161 Nursing Procedure 6.1 (continued) Pie-shaped wedges Vertical strip 4.

National contact information is 1-800-ACS-2345. Providing Postoperative Care For the woman who has had surgery to remove a malig- nant breast lump or an entire breast, excellent postopera-tive nursing care is crucial. Tell the woman what to expectin terms of symptoms and when they usually occur dur-ing treatment and after surgery. This allows women toanticipate these symptoms and proactively employ man-agement strategies to improve their cancer experience.Postoperative care includes immediate postoperative care,pain management, care of the affected arm, wound care,mobility care, respiratory care, emotional care, educationalneeds, and referrals. Immediate Postoperative Care Assess the client's respiratory status by auscultating the lungs and observing the breathing pattern. Assess circula-tion; note vital signs, skin color, and skin temperature. Ob-serve the client's neurologic status by evaluating the level ofalertness and orientation. Monitor the wound for amountand color of drainage. Monitor the intravenous lines forpatency, correct fluid, and rate. Assess the drainage tubefor amount, color, and consistency of drainage. Pain Management Provide analgesics as needed. Reassure the woman that her pain will be controlled. Teach the woman how tocommunicate her pain intensity on a scale of 0 to 10, with10 being the worst pain imaginable. Assess the client'spain level frequently and anticipate pain before assistingthe woman to ambulate. Affected Arm Care Elevate the affected arm on a pillow to promote lymph drainage. Make sure that no treatments are performed onthe affected arm, including laboratory draws, intravenouslines, blood pressures, and so on. Place a sign above thebed to warn others not to touch the affected arm. Wound Care Observe the wound often and empty drainage reservoirs as needed. Tell the client to report any evidence of infec-tion early, such as fever, chills, or any area of redness orinflammation along the incision line. Also tell the client toreport any increase in drainage, foul odor, or separation atthe incision site. Mobility Care Perform active range-of-motion and arm exercises as ordered. Encourage self-care activities for successful re-habilitation. Perform dressing and drainage care; explain the care during the procedure.162 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Respiratory Care Assist with turning, coughing, and deep breathing every 2 hours. Explain that this helps to expand collapsed alve-oli in the lungs, promotes faster clearance of inhalationagents from the body, and prevents postoperative pneu-monia and atelectasis. Emotional Care and Referrals Encourage the client to participate in her care. Assess her coping strategies preoperatively. Explain possiblebody image concerns after discharge. Promote the ACSwebsites, which provide the latest cancer therapy news. Encourage the client to attend local support groups for breast cancer survivors, such as Reach to Recovery, anACS program in which trained volunteers provide sup-port and up-to-date information for spouses, children,friends, and other loved ones. Reach to Recovery volun-teers can also, when appropriate, provide a temporarybreast form and give information on types of permanentprostheses, as well as lists of where those items are avail-able in the community. Educational Needs Provide follow-up information about adjunctive therapy. Explain that radiation therapy may start within weeks post-operatively. Discuss chemotherapy, its side effects andcycles, home care during treatment, and future monitor-ing strategies. Explain hormonal therapy, including anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors. Teach progressive armexercises to minimize lymphedema. Explain that ongoingsurveillance is needed to detect recurrence of cancer or anew primary site and that the patient will typically see thehealth care provider every 6 months. Nancy underwent a mastectomy with radiation and chemotherapy. What follow-up care is needed? How can thenurse assist Nancy to cope with her uncertain future? Whatcommunity resources might help her? Implementing Health-Promotion and Disease-Prevention Strategies In the past, most women assumed that there was little they could do to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer.However, research has found that the daily choices womenmake concerning breast cancer screening, diet, exercise,and other health practices have a profound impact oncancer risk. In the fight against cancer, nurses often assume a variety of roles, such as educator, counselor, advocate, and role model. Nurses can offer educationabout the following: Prevention Early detection Screening Dispelling myths and fears11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 162Self-examination techniques Individual risk status and strategies for risk reduction It is important to be knowledgeable about the most current evidence-based practices and cognizant of how themedia presents this information. Offer prevention strate-gies within the context of a woman's life. Factors such aslifestyle choices, economic status, and multiple roles needto be taken into consideration when counseling women.Advocate for healthy lifestyles and making sound choicesto prevent cancer. Nurses, like all health care profession-als, should offer guidance from a comprehensive perspec-tive that acknowledges the unique needs of each individual(Banning, 2007). Breast cancer is a frightening experience for women. Like a black cloud hanging over their heads, with little re-gard for any victim, breast cancer stalks women every-where they go. Many have a close friend or relative whois battling the disease; many have watched their mothersand sisters die of this dreaded disease. Those with riskfactors live with even greater anxiety and fear. No womanwants to hear those chilling words: \"The biopsy is posi-tive. You have breast cancer.\" Provide women with infor-mation about detection and risk factors, inform themabout the new ACS screening guidelines, instruct themon breast self-examination, and outline dietary changesthat might reduce their risk of breast cancer. Awareness is the rst step toward a change in habits. Raising the level of awareness about breast cancer is ofparamount importance, and nurses can play an impor-tant role in health promotion, disease prevention, andeducation. Breast Cancer Screening The three components of early detection are breast self-examination, clinical breast examination, andmammography. The ACS (2007b) has issued breast cancer screening guidelines that, for the rst time, offer specic guidance forthe women and greater clarification of the role of breastexaminations (Table 6.4). ACS screening guidelines arerevised about every 5 years to include new scientic nd-ings and developments. Women are exposed to multiple sources of cancer prevention information, and much of it may not be sound.Discuss the benets, risks, and potential limitations ofbreast self-examination, clinical breast examination, andmammography with each woman and tailor the informa-tion to her specic risk factors (ACS, 2007b). Based onthe new guidelines, make clinical judgments as to the ap-propriateness of recommending breast self-examination,and re-evaluate the need to teach the procedure to allwomen; the focus might instead be on encouraging regu-lar mammograms (depending, of course, on the woman'sindividual risk factors).CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 163 Breast self-examination is a technique that en- ables a woman to detect any changes in her breasts; thiscould result in early cancer detection. The emphasis isnow on awareness of breast changes, not just discovery ofcancer. Research has shown that breast self-examinationplays a small role in detecting breast cancer compared withself-awareness. However, doing breast self-examinationis one way for a woman to know how her breasts normallyfeel so that she can notice any changes that do occur(ACS, 2007g). There are two steps to conducting breast self- examination: visual inspection and tactile palpation.The visual part should be done in three separate posi-tions: with the arms up behind the head, with the armsdown at the sides, and bending forward. Instruct thewoman to look for: Changes in shape, size, contour, or symmetry Skin discoloration or dimpling, bumps/lumps Sores or scaly skin Discharge or puckering of the nipple In the second part, the tactile examination, the woman feels her breasts in one of three specic patterns: spiral,pie-shaped wedges, or up and down. When using any ofthe three patterns, the woman should use a circular rub-bing motion (in dime-sized circles) without lifting thengers. She checks not only the breasts but also betweenthe breast and the axilla, the axilla itself, and the areaabove the breast up to the clavicle and across the shoulder.The pads of the three middle fingers on the right handare used to assess the left breast; the pads of the threemiddle ngers on the left hand are used to assess the right20-39 40 +Woman's Age Screening ActivityTABLE 6.4 AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY BREAST CANCER SCREENING GUIDELINES Source: ACS, 2007c.Breast self-examination (BSE) is optional Clinical breast examination every 3 years BSE every month is optional Clinical breast examination every yearMammogram every year, continuing for as long as the woman is in goodhealth Women at increased risk (e.g., family history, genetic ten- dency, past history of cancer) should discuss with their healthcare professionals the pros and cons of starting mammogra-phy screening earlier, undergoing additional diagnostic tests(e.g., ultrasound or MRI), or increasing the frequency of examinations.11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 163breast. Instruct the woman to use three different degrees of pressure: Light (move the skin without moving the tissue underneath) Medium (midway into the tissue) Hard (down to the ribs) Once the tactile examination has been completed while standing in front of a mirror, it should be repeatedwhile lying down. Teaching Guidelines 6.4 details breastself-examination. Nutrition Nutrition plays a critical role in health promotion and dis- ease prevention (Escott-Stump, 2007). Being overweightor obese is a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausalwomen (Wright, 2007). Healthy People 2010 identified164 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN being overweight or obese as one of the 10 leading health indicators and a major health concern (USDHHS, 2000).Almost 62% of women over the age of 20 years are over-weight; of these, 33.4% are obese (Smith-Warner &Stampfer, 2007). A diet high in fruits, vegetables, and high-ber carbohydrates and low in animal fats seems to offerprotection against breast cancer as well as weight control.Women who followed these dietary guidelines decreasedtheir risk of breast cancer (Escott-Stump, 2007). The Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modication Trial (Prentice et al., 2006) was designed to study a low-fat diet, a nutritional approach to prevention of chronicdiseases. It found a marginally statistically significantreduction in breast cancer incidence among women inthe low-fat dietary pattern group. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR), which conducts extensive research, made the following TEACHING GUIDELINES 6.4 How to Perform Breast Self-Examination Step 1 Stand before a mirror. Check both breasts for anything unusual. Look for discharge from the nipple and puckering, dimpling, or scaling of the skin. The next two steps check for any changes in the contour of your breasts. As you do them, you shouldbe able to feel your muscles tighten.Step 2 Watch closely in the mirror as you clasp your hands behind your head and press your hands forward. Note any change in the contour of your breasts. 11223-06_CH06.qxd 8/4/08 2:44 PM Page 164CHAPTER 6 DISORDERS OF THE BREASTS 165 TEACHING GUIDELINES 6.4 (continued) How to Perform Breast Self-Examination Source: American Cancer Society.

The unique geographicvariability of breast cancer around the world and the lowrate of breast cancer in Asian compared to Western coun-tries prompted this interest. This area of research appearsStep 3 Next, press your hands firmly on your hips and bow slightly toward the mirror as you pull your shoulders and elbows forward. Note any change in the contour of your breasts. Some women perform the next partof the examination in the shower. Your ngers will glide easily over soapy skin, so you can concentrate on feeling for changes inside the breast. Step 4 Raise your left arm. Use 3 or 4 ngers of your right hand to feel your left breast rmly, carefully, and thoroughly. Beginning at the outer edge, press the flat part of your ngers in small circles, moving the circles slowly around the breast. Gradually work toward the nipple. Be sure to cover the whole breast.Pay special attention to the area between the breast and the underarm, including the underarmitself. Feel for any unusual lumps or masses under the skin. If you have any spontaneous discharge during themonth\u2014whether or not it is during your BSE\u2014seeyour doctor. Repeat the examination on your right breast. Step 5 Lie flat on your back with your left arm over your head and a pillow or folded towel under your leftshoulder. (This position flattens your breast andmakes it easier to check.)

Although the mechanismisn't clear, certain foods demonstrate anticancer proper-ties and boost the immune system. Phytochemical-richfoods include: Green tea and herbal teas Garlic Whole grains and legumes Onions and leeks Soybeans and soy products Fruits (citrus, apricots, pumpkin, berries) Green leafy vegetables (spinach, collards, romaine) Colorful vegetables (carrots, squash, tomatoes) Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower) Flax seeds (Escott-Stump, 2007) Adopt a holistic approach when addressing the nutri- tional needs of women with breast cancer. Incorporatenutritional assessment into the general overall assessmentof all women. Culturally sensitive nutritional assessmenttools need to be developed and used to enhance thisprocess. Providing examples of appropriate foods associ-ated with the woman's current dietary habits, relatingcurrent health status to nutritional intake, and placingproposed modications within a realistic personal frame-work may increase a woman's willingness to incorporateneeded changes in her nutritional behavior. Be able tointerpret research results and stay up to date on nutri-tional influences so that you can transmit this key infor-mation to the public. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Many women believe that all lumps are cancerous, but actually more than 90% of the lumps discovered arebenign and need no treatment. /H18546The most commonly encountered benign breast dis- orders in women brocystic suggests that women with brocystic breast disease or other benign breast conditions aremore likely to develop breast cancer later only if a breastbiopsy shows \"atypia\" or abnormal breast cells. /H18546Fibroadenomas are common benign solid breast tumors that can be stimulated by external estrogen, proges-terone, lactation, and pregnancy. /H18546An intraductal papilloma is generally less than 1 cm in diameter, not palpable, and produces a spontaneousserous, serosanguineous, or watery nipple discharge. /H18546Duct ectasia is a dilation and inflammation of the ducts behind the nipple that results in noncyclic breast pain,nipple retraction, and discharge. /H18546Mastitis is an infection of the connective tissue in the breast that occurs primarily in lactating or engorgedwomen; it is divided into lactational or nonlactationaltypes.166 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN /H18546Management of both types of mastitis involves the use of oral antibiotics (usually a penicillinase-resistant peni-cillin or cephalosporin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol)for pain and fever. /H18546Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer deaths (lung canceris rst) among American women. /H18546Breast cancer metastasizes widely and to almost all organs of the body, but primarily to the bone, lungs,lymph nodes, liver, and brain. /H18546The etiology of breast cancer is unknown, but the dis- ease is thought to develop in response to a number ofrelated factors: aging, delayed childbearing or neverbearing children, high breast density, family history ofcancer, late menopause, and hormonal factors. /H18546Breast cancer treatments fall into two categories: local and systemic. Local treatments are surgery and radi-ation therapy. Effective systemic treatments includechemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy. /H18546Women perceive their breasts as intrinsic to their fem- ininity, self-esteem, and sexuality, and the risk of los-ing a breast can provoke extreme anxiety. /H18546Nurses can influence both physical and emotional re- covery, which are both important aspects of care thathelp in improving the woman's quality of life and theability to survive. /H18546Providing up-to-date information and emotional support are central roles of the nurse in caring for the womanwith a diagnosis of breast cancer.

For instance, women may experi-ence pelvic support disorders related to pelvic relaxationor urinary incontinence. These disorders generally developafter years of wear and tear on the muscles and tissuesthat support the pelvic floor\u2014such as that which occurswith childbearing, chronic coughing, straining, surgery,or simply aging. In addition to pelvic support disorders,woman may also experience various benign neoplasms ofthe reproductive tract, such as cervical polyps, uterineleiomyomas (broids), ovarian cysts, genital stulas, andBartholin's cysts. This chapter provides an overview ofvarious pelvic support disorders and benign neoplasms,discussing the assessment, treatment, and preventionstrategies for each. Pelvic Support Disorders Pelvic support disorders such as pelvic organ prolapse(POP) and urinary and fecal incontinence are commonin aging women. The majority of the more than 13 mil-lion people in the United States who experience urinaryincontinence are women with POP (Smith, 2007). Pelvicsupport disorders cause signicant physical and psycho-logical morbidity and can diminish women's social inter-actions, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life.Because pelvic support disorders increase with age, theproblem will grow worse as our population ages. Thesedisorders occur as a result of weakness of the connec-tive tissue and muscular support of pelvic organs due toa number of factors: vaginal childbirth, obesity, lifting,chronic cough, con-stipation, and estrogen deciency (ACOG, 2007). Thebony pelvis has an exaggerated lumbar spine curve anddownward tilt to it. The bladder rests on the symphysisand the posterior organs rest on the sacrum and coccyx.The pelvis holds the organs, but a woman's erect pos-ture causes a funneling effect and constant downwardpressure. PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE Pelvic organ prolapse (from the Latin prolapsus, a slip- ping forth) refers to the abnormal descent or herniationof the pelvic organs from their original attachment sitesor their normal position in the pelvis. POP occurs whenstructures of the pelvis shift and protrude into or outside ofthe vaginal canal. The Egyptians were the rst to describeprolapse of the genital organs. Hippocrates made refer-ence to placing a pomegranate half into the vagina to treat organ prolapse. A disorder exclusive to women, POP rarelyresults in severe morbidity or mortality but can affect awoman's daily activities and quality of life.170 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN It is difcult to determine the incidence of POP, as the disorder is often asymptomatic and many women donot seek treatment. It has been estimated, however, thatup to 75% of all women who have given birth experiencePOP (ACOG, 2007). With the aging of the population,POP and its associated symptoms are becoming increas-ingly common (Bartoletti, 2007). The treatment and diagnosis of POP is challenging and problematic. Types of Pelvic Organ Prolapse The four most common types of genital prolapse are cysto-cele, rectocele, enterocele, and uterine prolapse occurs when the posterior bladder wall protrudes downward through the anterior vaginal wall. Rectocele occurs when the rectum sags and pushes against or into the posterior vaginal wall. Enterocele occurs when the small intestine bulges through the posterior vaginal wall (especially commonwhen straining). Uterine prolapse occurs when the uterus descends through the pelvic floor and into the vaginal canal.Multiparous women are at particular risk for uterineprolapse. The extent of uterine prolapse is described in terms of degree: First degree: prolapse of the organ into the vaginal canal Second degree: cervix descends to the vaginal introitus Third degree: cervix is below the vaginal introitus (Berzuk, 2007) Etiology Anatomic support of the pelvic organs is mainly providedby the levator ani muscle complex and the connective tis-sue attachments of the pelvic organ fascia. Dysfunction ofone or both of these components can lead to loss of sup-port and eventually POP. Weakened pelvic fl oor muscles also prevent complete closure of the urethra, resulting inurine leakage during physical stress. This problem is notlimited to older women: urinary incontinence has beendocumented in women of varying ages, including veryyoung women (Smith, 2007). Many risk factors for POP have been suggested, but the true cause is likely to be multifactorial. Causes mightinclude: Constant downward gravity because of erect human posture Atrophy of supporting tissues with aging and decline of estrogen levels Weakening of pelvic support related to childbirth trauma Reproductive surgery Family history of POP Young age at rst birthT11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 170 Connective tissue disorders Infant birthweight of more than 4,500 g Pelvic radiation Increased abdominal pressure secondary to: -Lifting of children or heavy objects-Straining due to chronic constipation-Respiratory problems or chronic coughing-Obesity (Jelovsek, Maher, & Barber, 2007) Therapeutic Management Treatment options for POP depend on the symptoms and their effect on the woman's quality of life. Impor-tant considerations when deciding on nonsurgical orsurgical options include the severity of symptoms, thewoman's preferences, the woman's health status, age,and suitability for surgery, and the presence of otherpelvic conditions (urinary or fecal incontinence). Whensurgery is being considered, the nature of the procedureand the likely outcome must be fully explained and dis- cussed with the woman and her partner. Treatment optionsCHAPTER 7 BENIGN DISORDERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 171 for POP include Kegel exercises, estrogen replacement therapy, dietary and lifestyle modifications, use of pes-saries or the Colpexin Sphere, and surgery (see Evidence-Based Practice 7.1). Kegel Exercises Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles to support the inner organs and prevent further prolapse.The purpose of pelvic floor exercises is to increase themuscle volume, which will result in a stronger muscularcontraction. Kegel exercises might limit the progressionof mild prolapse and alleviate mild prolapse symptoms,including low back pain and pelvic pressure. They willnot, however, help severe uterine prolapse. Hormone Replacement Therapy Hormone replacement therapy (orally, transdermally, orvaginally) may improve the tone and vascularity of thesupporting tissue in perimenopausal and menopausalwomen by increasing blood perfusion and the elasticity ofthe vaginal wall.

( (D) 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 171Dietary and Lifestyle Modications Dietary and lifestyle modications may help prevent pelvic relaxation and chronic problems later in life. Dietary habitscan exacerbate the prolapse by causing constipation andconsequently chronic straining. The stools of a consti-pated woman are hard and dry, and typically she muststrain while bearing down to defecate. This straining to passa hard stool increases intra-abdominal pressure, which overtime causes the pelvic organs to prolapse. Dietary mod-172 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN ifications can help to establish regular bowel movements without discomfort and eliminate flatus and bloating. Pessaries A pessary is a silicone or plastic device that is placed into the vagina to support the uterus, bladder, and rectum as aspace-lling device, replacing normal pressure on the vagi-nal walls when levator ani support is unreliable (Fig. 7.2).Although there are many types and shapes, the most com-monly used pessary is a rm ring that presses against thewall of the vagina and urethra to help decrease leakageand support a prolapsed vagina or uterus. Pessaries are oftwo main types: Support pessaries, which rest under the symphysis and sacrum and elevate the vagina (e.g., Ring, Gehrung,and Hodge pessaries) Space-occupying pessaries, which are designed to manage severe prolapse by supporting the uterus evenwith a lack of vaginal tone (e.g., cube, doughnut, andinflatable Gellhorn pessaries) Indications for pessary use include uterine prolapse or cystocele, especially among elderly clients for whomsurgery is contraindicated; younger women with prolapseHagen, S., Stark, D., Maher. C., & Adams, E. (2006). Conservative management of pelvic organ pro- lapse in women. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD003882. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003882.pub3.Study Pelvic organ prolapse (protrusion of the uterus, cervix, bladder, or bowel into the vagina because of weakness inthe tissues that normally support them) is common; in fact,some degree of prolapse is seen in 50% of parous women.The symptoms vary depending on the type of prolapse.Treatments include surgery, mechanical devices, and conservative management. Conservative treatments, suchas pelvic floor muscle training or lifestyle change, are com-monly recommended for women with mild or moderateprolapse. A study was done to assess the effects of con-servative management (physical and lifestyle interventions)for women with pelvic organ prolapse in comparison withno treatment or other treatment options (e.g., mechanicaldevices or surgery). Findings This review found three randomized trials of conservativemanagement for pelvic organ prolapse. One relatively large trial of an exercise program for elderly Thai women living in the community was not sufcientlywell conducted or reported to provide reliable ndings.A feasibility study (n =47 women) found that pelvic floor muscle training, delivered by a physiotherapist to sympto-matic women in an outpatient setting, may reduce theseverity of prolapse. The study provided some evidence ofbenet, which was sufcient to justify the large trial that isplanned to follow it. The third trial claimed benets but was reported in a way that could not be used in the analysis. Overall, the evidence found in this review was not sufcient to judge the value of conservative management of pelvicorgan prolapse. Large, better-quality, randomized controlledtrials are still needed. Nursing Implications Pelvic organ prolapse is a signicant clinical issue amongwomen of all ages, and it often results in discomfort, alteredlifestyle, and urinary incontinence. Although this reviewdid not identify a clear-cut first-line treatment, nurses cancontinue to stress lifestyle changes such as weight loss and daily pelvic floor strengthening exercises to improvethe client's quality of life. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 7.1 Is Conservative Management of Pelvic Organ Prolapse Effective in Women? Before hormone therapy is considered, a thorough medical history must be taken to assess her risk for complications (e.g., endometrialcancer, myocardial infarction, stroke, breast cancer,pulmonary emboli, and deep Becauseof these risks, estrogens, with or without progestins,should be given at the lowest effective dose and for theshortest duration consistent with the treatment goalsand risks for the individual woman (ACOG, 2007).Take NOTE! 11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 172who plan to have additional children; and women with marked prolapse who prefer to use a pessary rather thanundergo surgery (Newman, 2007). Many women usepessaries for only a short period of time and become freeof symptoms. Long-term use can lead to pressure necro-sis in some women; in this situation other methods ofsupport should be explored. Pessaries are tted by trial and error; the woman often needs to try several sizes or styles. The largest pessary thatthe woman can wear comfortably is generally the mosteffective. The woman should be instructed to report anydiscomfort or difculty with urination or defecation whilewearing the pessary. Colpexin Sphere A new intravaginal device, the Colpexin Sphere, which became available in 2006, supports the pelvic floor mus-cle and facilitates rehabilitation of the pelvic floor muscles.Although pessaries may support a prolapsed pelvic organ,CHAPTER 7 BENIGN DISORDERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 173 they do not allow for concomitant strengthening of pelvic floor musculature and they do not reduce urine leakage(Smith, 2007). The Colpexin Sphere is a polycarbonatesphere with a locator string that is tted above the hymenalring to support the pelvic floor muscle. The sphere is usedin conjunction with pelvic floor muscle exercises, whichshould be performed daily. Surgical Interventions Surgical interventions for genital organ prolapse are de-signed to correct specic defects, with the goals being torestore normal anatomy and to preserve function (ACOG,2007). Surgery is not an option for all women. Women whoare at high risk of suffering recurrent prolapse after a surgi-cal repair or who have morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or medical conditions in which gen-eral anesthesia would be risky are not good candidates forsurgical repair (Bartoletti, 2007), and noninvasive treat-ment strategies should be discussed with them. Surgical interventions might include anterior or pos- terior colporrhaphy (to repair a cystocele or be effec- tive for a first-degree prolapse. This surgical procedure tightens the anterior and posterior vaginal wall, thus or fascia vagina and bladder) is foldedand sutured to bring the bladder and urethra in properposition (Lazarou & Scotti, 2007). A vaginal hysterectomy is the treatment of choice for uterine prolapse because it removes the prolapsed organthat is bringing down the bladder and rectum with it. Itcan be combined with an anterior and posterior repair ifa cystocele or rectocele is present. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment for women with POP includes athorough health history and physical examination andseveral laboratory and diagnostic tests. Health History and Clinical Manifestations The cause of prolapse is multifactorial, with vaginal child-birth, advancing age, and increasing body mass index as the most consistent risk factors (Jelovsek, Maher, &Barber, 2007). Assessment of risk factors (chronic strain- ing, hysterectomy, normal aging, and abnormalities of con- nective tissue) in the woman's history will assist the health care provider in the diagnosis and treatment of POP. Thehistory should include questions about: The woman's obstetrical history (number of pregnancies, weight of newborns, pregnancy spacing) Chronic respiratory condition (chronic coughing) Menopausal status Weight history (loss or gain) A B FIGURE7.2Examples of pessaries. ( A) Various shapes and sizes of pessaries available.

POP is often asymptomatic, but when symptoms do occur, they areoften related to the site and type of prolapse. Symptomscommon to all types of prolapses are a feeling of drag-ging, a lump in the vagina, or something \"coming down.\"Women with POP can present either with one symptom,such as vaginal bulging or pelvic pressure, or with severalcomplaints, including many bladder, bowel, and pelvicsymptoms. Symptoms associated with POP are summa-rized in Box 7.1. Women present with varying degrees of descent. Uter- ine prolapse is the most troubling type of pelvic relaxation because it is often associated with concomitant defects ofthe vagina in the anterior, posterior, and lateral compart-ments (Lazarou & Scotti, 2007).174 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Physical Examination The pelvic examination performed by the health care provider includes an external genital inspection to visual-ize any obvious protrusion of the uterus, bladder, urethra,or vaginal wall occurring at the vaginal opening. Usu-ally the woman is asked to perform the Valsalva maneu- ver (bearing down) while the examiner notes which organprolapses rst and the degree to which it occurs. Anyurine leakage during the examination is important to note.The woman is asked to contract the pubococcygeal mus-cles (Kegel exercise); the health care provider inserts twongers into the vagina to assess the strength and symme-try of the contraction. Since genital organ prolapse cancause urinary symptoms such as incontinence, bladder function should be assessed by determining postvoid resid-ual with a catheter. If the woman has more than 100 mLof retained urine, she should be referred for further uro-dynamic evaluation and testing. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory tests that may be ordered to deter-mine the cause of POP might include a urinalysis to ruleout a bacterial infection, urine culture to identify the spe-cic organism if present, visualization of urine loss duringthe pelvic examination, and measurement of postvoidurine volume. Nursing Management Help the woman understand the nature of the condition,the treatment options, and the likely outcomes. Nursingconsiderations might include the following: Describe normal anatomy and causes of pelvic prolapse. Assess how this condition has affected the woman's life. Outline the options, with the advantages and disad- vantages of each. Allow the client to make the decision that is right for her. Provide education. Schedule preoperative activities needed for surgery. Reassure the client that there is a solution for her symptoms. Provide community education about genital prolapse. Nursing Care Plan 7.1 provides an overview of care for a woman with POP. Encourage Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Encourage the woman to perform Kegel exercises daily(Teaching Guidelines 7.1). Discuss current research nd-ings and educate the woman about hormone therapy,allowing the woman to make her own decision on whetherto use hormones. Controversy still exists regarding thebenets versus the risks of taking hormones, so the womanmust weigh this option carefully (Luft, 2006). Encourage Dietary and Lifestyle Modications Instruct clients to increase dietary ber and fluids to pre- vent constipation.

Her symptoms increase when she stands for long periods.She hasn't had menstrual cycles for at least a decade. She tells you, \"I'm not taking any of those menopausal hormones.\" NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Pain related to relaxation of pelvic support and elimination difculties Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will report an acceptable level of discomfort within 1 to 2 hours of intervention as evidenced by a rating of less than 4 on a 0-to-10 pain scale. Interventions: Providing Pain Management Obtain a thorough pain history, including ongoing pain experiences, methods of pain control used, what worked, whatdidn't, any allergies to pain medications, and the effect of pain on her activities of daily living to provide a baseline and enable a systematic approach to pain management. Assess the location, frequency, severity, duration, precipitating factors, and aggravating/alleviating factors to identify characteristics of the client's pain to plan appropriate interventions. Educate client about any medications prescribed (correct dosage, route, side effects, and precautions) to increase the client's understanding of the therapy and promote compliance. Assess problematic elimination patterns to identify underlying factors from which to plan appropriate prevention strategies. Encourage client to increase fluids and ber in diet and increase physical activity daily to promote peristalsis. Assist client with establishing regular toileting patterns by setting aside time daily for bowel elimination to promote regular bowel function and evacuation. Urge client to avoid the routine use of laxatives to reduce risk of compounding constipation. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Knowledge decit related to causes of structural disorders and treatment options Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will demonstrate understanding of current condition and treatments as evidenced by identifying treatment options, making health-promoting lifestyle choices, verbalizing appropriate health care practices, and adhering to treatment plan. Interventions: Provide Client Education Assess client's understanding of pelvic organ prolapse and its treatment options to provide a baseline for teaching. Review information provided about surgical procedures and recommendations for healthy lifestyle, obtaining feedback frequently, to validate client's understanding of instructions. Discuss association between uterine, bladder, and rectal prolapse and symptoms to help client understand the etiology of her symptoms and pain. Have client verbalize and discuss information related to diagnosis, surgical procedure, preoperative routine, and post-operative regimen to ensure adequate understanding and provide time for correcting or clarifying any misinformation or misconceptions. Provide written material with pictures to promote learning and help client visualize what has occurred to her body secondary to aging, weight gain, childbirth, and gravity. Discuss pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy, osteoporosis prevention, and cardiovascular events common inpostmenopausal women to promote informed decision making by the client about available menopausal therapies. Inform client about the availability of community resources and make appropriate referrals as needed to provide additional education and support. Document details of teaching and learning to allow for continuity of care and further education, if needed.11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 175fluid intake alleviates constipation by increasing stool bulk and stimulating peristalsis. It is accomplished byreplacing refined, low-fiber foods with high-fiber foods.The recommended daily intake of ber for women is 25 g(Dudek, 2006). In addition to increasing the amount ofber in her diet, also encourage the woman to drink eight8-oz glasses of fluid daily and to engage in regular aero-bic exercise, which promotes muscle tone and stimulatesperistalsis. Educate the client about other lifestyle changes that will assist with prolapse, such as: Achieve ideal weight to reduce intra-abdominal pressure and strain on pelvic organs, including pressure on thebladder. Wear a girdle or abdominal support to support the muscles surrounding the pelvic organs. Avoid lifting heavy objects to reduce the risk of increas- ing intra-abdominal pressure, which can push the pelvicorgans downward. Avoid high-impact aerobics, jogging, or jumping repeatedly to minimize the risk of increasing intra-abdominal pressure, which places downward pressure on the organs. Give up smoking to minimize the risk for a chronic \"smoker's cough,\" which increases intra-abdominalpressure and forces the pelvic organs downward. Provide Teaching for Pessary Use Educate the woman about pessary use. Discuss complica- tions as part of the instruction. Although the pessary is asafe device, it is still a foreign body in the vagina. Becauseof this, the most common side effects of the pessary areincreased vaginal discharge, urinary tract infections, vagini-tis, and odor. This can be reduced by douching with dilute vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. Postmenopausal womenwith thin vaginal mucosa are susceptible to vaginal ulcer-ation with the use of a pessary. Advise the woman to use176 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN estrogen cream to make the vaginal mucosa more resis- tant to erosion and to strengthen the vaginal walls. The woman must be capable of managing use of the pessary, either alone or with the help of a caretaker.The most common recommendations for pessary careinclude removing the pessary twice weekly and clean-ing it with soap and water; using a lubricant for inser-tion; and having regular follow-up examinations every6 to 12 months after an initial period of adjustment.Educate the woman in the care of her pessary so she feelscomfortable with all aspects of care before leaving thehealth care facility. Provide Perioperative Care Prepare the woman for surgery by reinforcing the risksand benefits of surgery and describing the postopera-tive course. Explain that a Foley catheter will be in place for up to 1 week, and that she might not be able to urinatedue to the swelling after the catheter has been removed.Provide home care instructions for the Foley catheter. Sheshould cleanse the perineal area daily with mild soap andwater, especially around where the catheter enters theurinary meatus. If the woman is provided with a leg bagto be worn during waking hours, instruct her to empty itfrequently and keep it below the level of the bladder toprevent backflow. The same principles are applied to theprimary Foley bag when emptying. During the recovery period, instruct the client to avoid for several weeks activities that cause an increasein abdominal pressure, such as straining, sneezing, andcoughing. In addition, advise her to avoid lifting any-thing heavy or straining to push anything. Explain to thewoman that stool softeners and gentle laxatives might beprescribed to prevent constipation and straining withbowel movements. Pelvic rest will be prescribed until theoperative area is healed in 6 weeks. Promote Prevention Strategies Limited data are available on ways to prevent POP. Ap-proaches include lifestyle changes that reduce modiablerisk factors, such as losing weight, avoiding heavy lifting,and relieving constipation. Explore with the woman whatfactors in her lifestyle might be modified to reduce herrisk of developing POP (primary prevention), or improveher quality of life after receiving treatment (secondaryprevention). URINARY INCONTINENCE Urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine suf- cient enough to be a social or hygiene problem (Reena,Kekre, & Kekre, 2007). This disorder affects approx-imately 25 million people in the United States, about12 million of them women (Berzuk, 2007). It has beenTEACHING GUIDELINES 7.1 Performing Kegel Exercises Squeeze the muscles in your rectum as if you are trying to prevent passing flatus. Stop and start urinary flow to help identify thepubococcygeus muscle. Tighten the pubococcygeus muscle for a count ofthree, and then relax it. Contract and relax the pubococcygeus muscle rapidly10 times. Try to bring up the entire pelvic floor and beardown 10 times. Repeat Kegel exercises at least ve times daily.11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 176estimated that one in four women experience urinary in- continence at some time in their life, varying in severityfrom mild to severe (Selby, 2006). It is more common than diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, both of which re-ceive a great deal of press attention. About half the womenwith incontinence have never discussed the problem withtheir health care provider because they feel ashamed, em-barrassed, guilty, or lacking control (Wallace, 2007). Incontinence can have far-reaching effects. Some women experience anxiety, depression, social isolation,and disruptions in their self-esteem and dignity. It cancause the woman to stop working, traveling, socializing,and enjoying sexual relationships. In addition, incon-tinence can create a tremendous burden for caretakersand is a common reason for admission to a long-term carefacility (Lemack, 2007). The three most common types of incontinence are urge incontinence (overactive bladder caused by detrusormuscle contractions), incontinence (inadequate uri-nary sphincter function), and (involvesboth stress and urge incontinence) (Ogundele & Silverberg,2007). Comparison 7.1 details these types. Pathophysiology and Etiology Urinary continence requires several factors, including ef-fective functioning of the bladder, adequate pelvic floormuscles, neural control from the brain, and integrity ofthe neural connections that facilitate voluntary control.CHAPTER 7 BENIGN DISORDERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 177 The bladder neck and proximal urethra function as a sphincter. During urination the sphincter relaxes and thebladder empties. The ability to control urination requiresthe integrated function of numerous components of thelower urinary tract, which must be structurally sound andfunction normally. Incontinence can develop if the blad-der muscles become overactive due to weakened sphinc-ter muscles, if the bladder muscles become too weak tocontract properly, or if signals from the nervous systemto the urinary structures are interrupted. A major factorin women that contributes to urinary continence is the es-trogen level, because this hormone helps maintain bladdersphincter tone. In perimenopausal or menopausal women,incontinence can be a problem as estrogen levels begin todecline and genitourinary changes occur. In simple terms,the bladder is the reservoir, the urethra is the seal, and thelevator ani muscle is the gate that holds pressure againstthe outflow of urine by supporting the urethra and bladderfrom below. When there is a dysfunction of any of the threestructures, incontinence occurs. Contributing factors in urinary incontinence include: Fluid especially alcohol, carbonated drinks, and caffeinated beverages Constipation: alters the position of the pelvic organs and puts pressure on the bladder Habitual \"preventive\" emptying: may result in training the bladder to hold only small amounts of urine Advancing age: age-related anatomic changes provide less pelvic support Pregnancy and childbirth: damage to pelvic structures during childbirth Obesity: increases abdominal pressure (Hines & Miller, 2006) Therapeutic Management Treatment options depend on the type of urinary incon-tinence. In general, the least invasive procedure with the Incontinence is preventable, treatable, and often curable. However, many women believe that loss of bladder function is a normal andexpected part of aging.Take NOTE! Description EtiologySigns and SymptomsUrge Incontinence Precipitous loss of urine, preceded by a strong urge to void, with increased bladder pres-sure and detrusor contraction Causes might be neurologic, idiopathic, or infectious Urgency, frequency, nocturia, and a large amount of urine lossStress Incontinence Accidental leakage of urine that occurs with increased pressure on the bladder fromcoughing, sneezing, laughing, or physicalexertion Develops commonly in women in their 40s and 50s, usually as the result of weakenedmuscles and ligaments in the pelvis following childbirth Involuntary loss of a small amount of urine in response to physical activity that raisesintra-abdominal pressureCOMPARISON CHART 7.1 Urge Incontinence vs. Stress Incontinence11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 177fewest risks is the first choice for treatment. Surgery is used only if other methods have failed. There is a wide-spread belief that urinary incontinence is an inevitableproblem of getting older and that little or nothing canbe done to relieve symptoms or reverse it. Nothing isfurther from the truth, and attitudes must change so thatwomen feel comfortable seeking help for this embarrass-ing condition. For many women with urge incontinence, simple re- assurance and lifestyle interventions might help. However,if more than simple lifestyle measures are needed, effectivetreatments might include: Bladder training to establish normal voiding intervals (every 3 to 5 hours) Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor musculature Pessary ring to support pelvic structures that have weakened Pharmacotherapy to reduce the urge to void. Anti- cholinergic agents such as oxybutynin (Ditropan) ortolterodine (Detrol) might be prescribed. The mostcommon side effects of anticholinergic agents are drymouth, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, dizziness,and headaches (Lemack, 2007). For women with stress incontinence, treatment is not always a cure, but it can minimize the impact of this con-dition on the woman's quality of life. Some treatment op-tions for stress incontinence might include: Weight loss if needed Avoidance of constipation Smoking cessation Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor Pessaries Weighted vaginal cones to improve the tone of pelvic floor muscles Periurethral injection (injecting a bulking agent [collagen] to form a bulge that brings the urethralwalls closer together to achieve a better closure) Medications such as duloxetine (Cymbalta, Yentreve) to increase urethral sphincter contractions during thestorage phase of the urination cycle Estrogen replacement therapy to improve bladder sphincter tone Surgery to correct genital prolapse and improve urethral and bladder tone Nursing Assessment The assessment of the incontinent woman includes a his-tory, physical examination, laboratory tests, and possiblyurodynamic testing. The onset, frequency, severity, andpattern of incontinence should be determined, as well asany associated symptoms such as frequency, dysuria, ur-gency, and nocturia. Incontinence may be quantied byasking the woman if she wears a pad and how often thepad is changed. A review of the woman's current medica-178 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN tions, including over-the-counter medications, should be included in the history. A complete physical examination should be carried out by the health care provider; it should include a neuro-logic assessment and pelvic and rectal examinations. Thepresence of associated POP should be noted because it can contribute to the woman's voiding problems andmay have an impact on diagnosis and treatment. A rec-tal examination is done to evaluate sphincter tone andperineal sensation. A urinalysis is performed to look for hematuria, pyuria, glucosuria, or proteinuria. A urine culture is done thereis pyuria or bacteriuria. Postvoid residual should be mea-sured either with pelvic ultrasound or directly with a catheter. If the residual exceeds the limit set, urodynamic testing is then used to diagnose the incontinence. Nursing Management Incontinence can be devastating and can cause psychoso-cial concerns and isolation. Nurses can encourage womenwith troublesome symptoms to seek help. Discuss the treat-ment options with the client, including benets and poten-tial outcomes, and encourage her to select the continencetreatment best for her lifestyle. Provide education aboutgood bladder habits and strategies to reduce the incidenceor severity of incontinence (Teaching Guidelines 7.2). Pro-vide support and encouragement to ensure compliance.Remember that aging can increase the risk of incontinence, TEACHING GUIDELINES 7.2 Managing Urinary Incontinence Avoid drinking too much fluid (i.e., 1.5 L total dailylimit), but do not decrease your intake of fluids. Reduce intake of fluids and foods that are bladderirritants and precipitate urgency, such as chocolate,caffeine, sodas, alcohol, articial sweetener, hotspicy foods, orange juice, tomatoes, and watermelon(Lemack, 2007). Increase fiber and fluids in your diet to reduceconstipation. Control blood glucose levels to prevent polyuria. Treat chronic cough. Remove any barriers that delay you from reachingthe toilet. Practice good perineal hygiene by using mild soapand water. Wipe from front to back to preventurinary tract infections. Become aware of adverse drug effects. Take your medications as prescribed. Continue to do pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises.11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 178CHAPTER 7 BENIGN DISORDERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 179 POLYPS Polyps are small benign growths. The cause of polyp growth is not well understood, but they are frequently theresult of infection. Polyps might be associated with chronicinflammation, an abnormal local response to increasedlevels of estrogen, or local congestion of the cervical vas-culature (Kaminski & Hoffman, 2007). Single or multiplepolyps might occur. They are most common in multi- parous women. Polyps can appear anywhere but are mostcommon on the cervix and in the uterus (Fig. 7.3). Cervical polyps often appear after menarche. They occur in 2% to 5% of women, and approximately 2% ofthese polyps have cancerous changes (Verga, 2006). Endo-cervical polyps are commonly found in multiparous womenage 40 to 60. Endocervical polyps are more common thancervical polyps, with a stalk of varied width and length.Endometrial polyps are benign tumors or localized over-growths of the endometrium. Most endometrial polypsare solitary, and they rarely occur in women younger than20 years of age. The incidence of these polyps rises steadilywith increasing age, peaks in the fth decade of life, andgradually declines after menopause. They are present inup to 25% of women being seen for abnormal bleeding(Verga, 2006). Therapeutic Management Treatment of polyps usually consists of simple removalwith small forceps done on an outpatient basis, removalduring hysteroscopy, or dilatation and curettage (D&C).The polyp base can be removed by laser vaporization.Because many polyps are infected, an antibiotic may bebut incontinence is not an inevitable part of aging. Review the anatomy and physiology of the urinary system and offer simple explanations to help the woman cope with urinaryalterations. Therapeutic listening is important. Be awareof the courage it takes for a woman to disclose an embar-rassing condition. Consider THIS! Life can be complicated and embarrassing at timeswhen we least expect it. I met a man in church whoseemed interested in me, and he asked me out for coffeeafter Sunday services. I have been alone for 10 yearsand this prospect seemed exciting to me. We talked forhours over coffee and seemed to have a great deal incommon, especially since both of us had lost ourspouses to cancer. He asked me to go square dancingwith him, since that was an activity we both had en-joyed in the past with our spouses. I hadn't been out orphysically active for ages and didn't realize how mybody had changed with age. It was during the rst dance that I noticed a wet sensation between my legs, which I was unable to con-trol. I managed to continue on and pretend that allwas ne, but then realized what many of my friendswere talking about\u2014stress incontinence. Not beingable to control one's urine is very embarrassing and itcomplicates your life, but I made up my mind that itwasn't going to control me! Thoughts: Gravity and childbirth take a toll on women's reproductive organs by bringing them down-ward. This woman is not going to let stress inconti-nence curtail her outside activity, which demonstratesa good attitude. What can be done about her embar-rassing accidents? Were there any preventive strategiesshe could have used at an earlier age? Simple diet and lifestyle alterations, combined with a proper pelvic floor muscle strengthening program, can often produce signicantimprovements for women of all ages.Take NOTE! Benign Growths The most common benign growths of the reproduc-tive tract include cervical, endocervical, and endome-trial PM Page 179ordered after removal as a preventive measure or to treat early signs of infection. Although polyps are rarely cancerous, a specimen should be sent after surgery to a pathology laboratoryto exclude malignancy. A cervical biopsy typically revealsmildly atypical cells and signs of infection. Polyps rarelyreturn after they are removed. Regularly scheduled Papsmears are suggested for women with cervical polyps to de-tect any future abnormal growths that may be malignant. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment for a woman with polyps includesassisting with the physical examination and preparingthe collected specimen to be sent to the cytologist. Clinical Manifestations Assess for clinical manifestations of polyps. Most endo-cervical polyps are cherry red, while most cervical polypsare grayish-white (Verga, 2006). Cervical and endocer- vical polyps are often asymptomatic, but they can produce mild symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding (afterintercourse or douching, between menses) or discharge.The most common clinical manifestation of endometrialpolyps is metrorrhagia (irregular, acyclic uterine bleeding). Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies Typically, cervical polyps are diagnosed when the cervix is visualized through a speculum during the woman's annualgynecologic examination (Kaminski & Hoffman, 2007).Endometrial polyps are not detected on physical exami-nation, but rather with ultrasound or hysteroscopy (intro-duction of a small camera through the cervix to visualizethe uterine cavity). Nursing Management Nursing management of polyps involves explaining thecondition and the rationale for removal and giving follow-up care instructions. The nurse also assists the health care provider with the removal procedure. UTERINE FIBROIDS Uterine broids , or leiomyomas, are benign prolifera- tions composed of smooth muscle and brous connectivetissue in the uterus. Fibroids can occur in the submucouslayer, the intramural layer, or the subserous layer of theuterus (Fig. 7.4). They are estrogen-dependent and thusgrow rapidly during the childbearing years, when estrogenis plentiful, but they shrink during menopause, when estro-gen levels decline. It is believed that these benign tumors develop in up to 50% of all women older than age 30(Thomason, 2007). Fibroids are the most common indi-180 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN cation for hysterectomy in the United States. The peak incidence occurs around the age of 45, and they are twoto three times more prevalent in African-American women(Verga, 2006). Etiology Although the cause of broids is unknown, several pre-disposing factors have been identied, including: Age (late reproductive years) Genetic predisposition African-American ethnicity Nulliparity Obesity (Alexander et al., 2007) Therapeutic Management Treatment depends on the size of the fibroids and thewoman's symptoms. There are several options, fromwatchful waiting to surgery. Medical Management The goals of medical therapy are to reduce symptoms andto reduce the tumor size. This can be mifepristone, a progestin antagonist. Both have pro-duced regression and reduced the size of the tumors without surgery, but long-term therapy is expensive and Subserosal SubmucosalIntramural FIGURE7.4Submucosal, intramural, and subserosal broids.11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 180not tolerated by most women. The side effects of GnRH medications include hot flashes, headaches, mood changes,vaginal dryness, musculoskeletal malaise, bone loss, anddepression (Thomason, 2007). Long-term mifepristonetherapy can result in endometrial hyperplasia, which in-creases the risk of endometrial malignancy. Once eithertherapy is stopped, the fibroids typically recur. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is an option in which polyvinyl alcohol pellets are injected into selectedblood vessels via a catheter to block circulation to the fi-broid, causing it to shrink and producing symptom res-olution. After treatment, most broids are reduced by 50% within 3 months, but they might recur (Edwards et al.,2007). The failure rate is approximately 10% to 15%, andthis therapy should not be performed on women desiringto retain their fertility. Surgical Management For women with large fibroids or severe menorrhagia,surgery is preferred over medical treatment. Surgical man-agement might involve myomectomy, laser surgery, or hysterectomy. Myomectomy involves removing the fibroid alone. A myomectomy is performed via laparoscopy, through anabdominal incision, or through a vaginal approach. Theadvantage is that only the fibroid is removed; fertility isnot jeopardized because this procedure leaves the uter-ine muscle walls intact. Myomectomy relieves symp-toms but does not affect the underlying process; thus,fibroids grow back and further treatment will be neededin the future. Laser surgery (or electrocauterization) involves de- stroying small fibroids with lasers. Laser therapy can bedone using a vaginal approach or laparoscopically. Thelaser treatment preserves the uterus, but the processmay cause scarring and adhesions, thus impairing fertility(Verga, 2006). Fibroids can return after this procedure.Controversy remains as to whether laser treatment weak-ens the uterine wall and thus may contribute to uterinerupture in the future. A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. After cesarean section, it is the second most frequentlyperformed surgical procedure for women in the UnitedStates. Approximately 600,000 hysterectomies are per-formed annually in the United States (CDC, 2007).The top three conditions associated with hysterectomiesare fibroids, endometriosis, and uterine prolapse (CDC,2007). A hysterectomy to remove broids eliminates boththe symptoms and the risk of recurrence, but it also ter-minates the woman's ability to bear children. Three typesof hysterectomy. In a vaginal hysterectomy, the uterus is removed through an incision in the posterior vagina. Advantagesinclude a shorter hospital stay and recovery time and noCHAPTER 7 BENIGN DISORDERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 181 abdominal scars. Disadvantages include a limited oper- ating space and poor visualization of other pelvic organs. In a laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, the uterus is removed through a laparoscope, throughwhich structures within the abdomen and pelvis are visu- alized. Small incisions are made in the abdominal wall to permit the laparoscope to enter the surgical site. Advan-tages include a better surgical eld, less pain, lower cost, and a shorter recovery time. Disadvantages include poten-tial injury to the bladder and the inability to remove en-larged uteruses and scar tissue. In abdominal hysterectomy, the uterus and other pelvic organs are removed through an incision in theabdomen. This procedure allows the surgeon to visualizeall pelvic organs and is typically used when a malignancyis suspected or a very large uterus is present. Disadvan-tages include the need for general anesthesia, a longer hos- pital stay and recovery period, more pain, higher cost, and a visible scar on the abdomen. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment for the woman with uterine broids in-cludes a thorough health history and physical examination. Health History and Clinical Manifestations The history should include questions about the woman'smenstrual cycle, including alterations in the menstrualpattern (e.g., pain or pressure, aggravating and alleviatingfactors), history of infertility, and any history of sponta- neous abortion, which might indicate a space-occupyinguterine lesion. Ask if any female relatives have had broids,as there is a familial predisposition. Assess for clinical man-ifestations of uterine broids. Symptoms of broids depend on their size and location and may include: Chronic pelvic pain Low back pain Iron deciency anemia secondary to bleeding Bloating Infertility (with large tumors) Dysmenorrhea Dyspareunia Urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence Irregular vaginal bleeding (menorrhagia) Feeling of heaviness in the pelvic region Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies The bimanual examination performed by the health care provider typically shows an enlarged, irregular uterus. Theuterus may be palpable abdominally if the broid is verylarge. Ultrasound may be used to conrm the diagnosis. Nursing Management Provide information about surgery so the woman can makean informed decision. Offer a thorough explanation of the11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 181procedure and aftercare (Box 7.2). A woman undergoing a hysterectomy for the treatment of broids often needsspecial care. GENITAL FISTULAS Genital stulas are abnormal openings between a genital tract organ and another organ, such as the urinary tract orthe gastrointestinal tract. A stula can result from a con-genital anomaly, surgical complications, Bartholin's gland abscesses, radiation, or malignancy, but the majority of s-tulas that occur worldwide are related to obstetric trauma(Husain et al., 2007). During normal labor, the bladderis displaced upward into the abdomen and the anteriorvaginal wall, the base of the bladder, and the urethra arecompressed between the fetal head and the posterior pubis.When labor is obstructed or prolonged, this unrelievedcompression causes ischemia, which causes pressure necro-sis and subsequent stula formation.182 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Common types of stulas include: Vesicovaginal: communication between the bladder and genital tract Urethrovaginal: communication between the urethra and the vagina Rectovaginal: communication between the rectum or sigmoid colon and the vagina The direct consequences of this damage include uri- nary incontinence and fecal incontinence if the rectum is involved. This tragic condition has plagued women sincethe beginning of history (Hamilton, Spencer, & Evans,2007). Therapeutic Management Many small stulas will heal without treatment, but largestulas often require surgical repair; surgery may be post-poned until the edema or inflammation in the surround-ing tissues has dissipated. Surgical repair of stulas isassociated with a high success rate if it is done in a timelyBOX 7.2 Nursing Interventions for a Woman Undergoing a Hysterectomy Preoperative Care Instruct the patient and her family about the procedure and aftercare. Provide interventions to reduce anxiety (due to perceived threats to the woman's self-concept and role functioning)and fear of alteration in body image, complications, andpain. Prepare the woman so she knows what to expectthroughout her perioperative experience. Explain post-operative pain management procedures that will be used.Identify the high-risk woman early to reduce her stress. Teach turning, deep breathing, and coughing before surgery to prevent postoperative atelectasis and respiratory complications such as pneumonia. Encourage the woman to discuss her feelings. Some women equate their femaleness with their reproductivecapability, and loss of the uterus could evoke grieving. Complete all preoperative orders in a timely manner to allow for rest. Postoperative Care Provide comfort measures. Administer analgesics promptly or use a PCA pump. Administer antiemetics to control nausea and vomiting per order. Change the client's linens and gown frequently to promote hygiene. Change the client's position frequently and use pillows for support to promote comfort and pain management. Assess the incision, the dressing, and vaginal bleeding and report if bleeding is excessive (soaking perineal padwithin an hour). Monitor elimination and provide increased fluids and ber to prevent constipation and straining. Encourage ambulation and active range-of-motion exercises when in bed to prevent thrombophlebitis andvenous stasis. Monitor vital signs to detect early complications. Be comfortable discussing sexual concerns with the client. Discharge Planning Advise the client to reduce her activity level to avoid fatigue, which might inhibit healing. Advise the client to rest when she is tired and to increase her activity level slowly. Educate the client on the need for pelvic rest (nothing in the vagina) for 6 weeks. Instruct the client to avoid heavy lifting or straining for about 6 weeks to prevent an increase in intra-abdominalpressure, which could weaken her sutures. Teach the client the signs and symptoms of infection. Advise the woman to take showers instead of tub baths to reduce the risk for infection. Encourage the client to eat a healthy diet with increased intake of fluids to prevent dehydration and fluid andelectrolyte imbalance. Instruct the client to change her perineal pad frequently to prevent infection. Explain and schedule follow-up care appointments as needed. Provide information about community resources for support/help.11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 182manner, but larger stulas and those of long duration have a poorer prognosis (Kriplani et al., 2007). Nursing Assessment The history should include questions about any changesin the woman's urinary and bowel patterns. Assess forcommon signs and symptoms of stulas, which are relatedto the type of stula. If the opening involves the rectum,feces and flatus will leak through the vagina. If it involves the bladder, urine will leak from the vagina. Depending onthe location and size of the stula, the woman may or maynot experience discomfort. The health care provider candetect these abnormal openings through inspection andpalpation during the pelvic examination. Diagnostic orlaboratory tests are generally not ordered once this con-dition is found. Nursing Management Provide guidance and support. Offer information to helpthe woman learn about her condition and, with appro-priate intervention, to improve her quality of life. Beginby making sure the woman understands her anatomy andwhy she is having such symptoms. Provide a thorough ex-planation of the treatment options so that she can makean informed decision. Be sensitive to the woman's feelingof shame and fear about her incontinence; these feelingsmay be why she delayed seeking treatment. Address all ofthe woman's needs, both physical and emotional. BARTHOLIN'S CYSTS A Bartholin's cyst is a swollen, fluid-lled, sac-like structure that results when one of the ducts of the Bartholin's glandbecomes blocked. The cyst may become infected and anabscess may develop in the gland. The Bartholin's glandsare two mucus-secreting glandular structures with ductopenings bilaterally at the base of the labia minora near theopening of arousal. cysts are most in the vulva, affecting approximately 2% of womenat some time in their life (Patil, Sultan, & Thakar, 2007). Therapeutic Management Treatment can be conservative or surgical dependingon the symptoms, the size of the cyst, and whether it isinfected or not. Small asymptomatic cysts do not requiretreatment. Sitz baths along with analgesics are used to re-duce discomfort. Antibiotics are prescribed if the gland isinfected. The aim of treatment for a cyst or abscess is tocreate a stulous tract from the dilated duct to the outsidevulva by incision and drainage (I&D). However, cysts orabscesses tend to return if this option is used.CHAPTER 7 BENIGN DISORDERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 183 Other treatment options beyond I&D include place- ment of a Word catheter to prevent closure and to allowdrainage and use of a carbon dioxide laser to removethe cyst. After the Word catheter is inserted, the balloontip is inflated and it is left in place for 4 to 6 weeks. Thisprocedure is a safe and effective alternative to surgery(Haider et al., 2007). Treatment for a pregnant womanwith a Bartholin's cyst depends on the severity of thesymptoms and whether an infection is present. Surgerymay be delayed until after the woman gives birth if thereare no symptoms. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment for the woman with a Bartholin's cystincludes a thorough health history and physical examina-tion and laboratory and diagnostic tests. Health History The history should include questions about the woman'ssexual practices and protective measures used. Assess forcommon signs and symptoms of Bartholin's cysts. Thewoman may be asymptomatic if the cyst is small (less than 5 cm) and not infected. If infection is present, symptomsinclude varying degrees of pain, especially when walkingor sitting; unilateral edema; redness around the gland; anddyspareunia. Extensive inflammation may cause systemicsymptoms. Abscess formation occurs when the cysticfluid becomes infected. An abscess usually develops rap-idly over a 2- to 3-day period and may spontaneously rup-ture. A history of sudden relief of pain following profuse discharge is highly suggestive of spontaneous rupture(Schuiling & Likis, 2006). Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies The diagnosis of Bartholin's cysts or abscesses is primarily made during a physical examination when a protrudingtender labial mass is located. In women over the age of 40,there is an increased risk of malignancy, accounting for2% to 7% of all invasive vulvar of the purulent of the cervix should be obtained for Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis to rule out a sexually transmit- ted infection. Nursing Management Nurses must be aware of and knowledgeable about vulvarcysts and treatment options. The woman may be aware ofa vulvar cyst secondary to the pain or may be unaware of itif it is asymptomatic. A Bartholin's cyst may be an inciden-tal nding during a routine pelvic examination. Explain thecause of the cyst and assist with cultures if needed. Providereassurance and support.11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 183OVARIAN CYSTS An ovarian cyst is a fluid-lled sac that forms on the ovary (Fig. 7.5). These very common growths are benign 90% ofthe time and are asymptomatic in many women (Hackley,Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Ovarian cysts occur in 30% ofwomen with regular menses, 50% of with 6% of postmenopausal women (Verga, 2006).When the cysts grow large and exert pressure on surround-ing structures, women often seek medical help. Types of Ovarian Cysts The most common benign are caused by the failure of the ovarian fol-licle to rupture at the time of ovulation. Follicular cysts sel-dom grow larger than 5 cm in diameter; most regress andrequire no treatment. They can occur at any age but aremore common in reproductive-aged women and are rareafter menopause. They are detected by vaginal ultrasound. Corpus Luteum (Lutein) Cysts A corpus luteum cyst forms when luteumbecomes cystic or hemorrhagic and fails to degenerateafter 14 days. These cysts might cause pain and delay thenext menstrual period. A pelvic ultrasound helps to makethis diagnosis. Typically these cysts appear after ovulation and resolve without intervention. Theca-Lutein Cysts Prolonged abnormally high levels of human chorionicgonadotropin (hCG) stimulate the development of theca-lutein cysts. are and Clomidtherapy.184 Syndrome Polycystic ovary cysts within the ovary with ovarian function. is associated with obe-sity, hyperinsulinemia, elevated luteinizing hormone levels(linked to (viriliza-tion), hirsutism (male-pattern hair growth), follicularatresia (ovarian growth failure), ovarian and cystformation, anovulation (failure to ovulate), and amenor- rhea (absence of menstruation or irregular periods). Re-cent studies also indicate that PCOS is associated with anincrease in the risk of uterine broids (Wise et al., 2007).It is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women, affecting 1 in 15 women in the United States(Panidis & Farmakiotis, 2007). Initially PCOS was called Stein-Leventhal syndrome after its researchers, but it is now recognized to be ananabolic syndrome (Vignesh & Mohan, 2007). Its etiol-ogy is not clearly understood, but studies suggest a genetic(autosomal-dominant) component (Speroff & Mishell,2007). Therapeutic Management Treatment of ovarian cysts focuses on differentiating a benign cyst from a solid ovarian malignancy. Transvagi-nal ultrasound is useful in distinguishing fluid-lled cystsfrom solid masses. Laparoscopy may be needed to removethe cyst, if it is large and pressing on surrounding struc-tures. For smaller cysts, monitoring with repeat ultra-sounds every 3 to 6 months might be in order (Helm,2007). Oral contraceptives are often prescribed to sup-press gonadotropin levels, which may help resolve thecysts. Pain medication is also prescribed if needed. Management of PCOS includes both drug and non- drug therapy, along with lifestyle modications. Goals oftherapy focus on reducing the production and circulatinglevels of androgens, protecting the endometrium againstthe effects of unopposed estrogens, supporting lifestylechanges to achieve ideal body weight, lowering the riskof cardiovascular disease, avoiding the effects of hyper-insulinemia on the risk of cardiovascular disease and di- abetes, and inducing ovulation to achieve pregnancy ifdesired (see Evidence-Based Practice 7.2). Treatmentmodalities for PCOS are highlighted in Box 7.3. FIGURE7.5Ovarian cyst. Careful attention should be given to this condition because affected women are at increased risk for long-term health problems such ascardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia,type 2 diabetes (half of all women), and cancer (endo-metrial, breast, and ovarian) (Lorenz & Wild, 2007).Take NOTE! 11223-07_CH07.qxd 8/4/08 2:45 PM Page 184Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment for the woman with PCOS includes a thorough health history and physical examination andlaboratory and diagnostic tests. Health History The history should include questions about the woman's symptoms, including onset, location, frequency, quality,CHAPTER 7 BENIGN DISORDERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 185 intensity, and aggravating and alleviating factors of her dis- comfort. Note the last menstrual period and whether or nother cycles are regular. Ask about her overall general healthand any changes recently noticed, such as a change in ab-dominal girth without a concomitant weight gain. Assess for common signs and symptoms of ovarian cysts. Findings might include: Hirsutism (face and chin, upper lip, areola, lower abdomen and perineum) Alopecia (frontal region and crown of head) Virilization (clitoral hypertrophy, deepening of voice, increased muscle mass, male-patternbaldness) Menstrual irregularity and infertility (menorrhagia, anovulation) Polycystic ovaries (12 or more follicles on ovaries) Obesity (occurs in more than 50% of women with PCOS; occurs in abdominal region, with an increasein the waist-hip ratio) Insulin resistance (chronic hyperinsulinemia leads to type 2 diabetes) Metabolic syndrome (elevated cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein; risk of cardiovascular disease) Increased risk for endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer Psychological impact (depression, frustration, anxiety, eating disorders) Acne (face and shoulders) (Krantz, 2007)Costello, M., Shrestha, B., Eden, J., Sjoblom, P., & Johnson, N.

They are also at greater risk of developing diabetes,cardiovascular disease, and endometrial cancer. Insulin-sensitizing drugs (ISDs) have recently been advocated as asafer and more effective long-term treatment than the oralcontraceptive pill (OCP) in women with PCOS. A study wasconducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of ISDsversus the OCP (alone or in combination) in improvingclinical, hormonal, and metabolic features of PCOS. Findings In women with PCOS, the OCP is more effective than ISDs inimproving menstrual pattern and reducing serum androgen(male hormone) levels, whereas the ISD metformin is moreeffective than the OCP in reducing fasting insulin levelsand not increasing triglyceride levels. There is insufficientevidence in favor of either metformin or the OCP in treating hirsutism or acne, or in preventing diabetes, heart disease,or endometrial cancer. The limited data available do notsupport the preferential use of either ISDs or the OCP(alone or in combination) for the long-term medical management of PCOS. Nursing Implications Oral contraceptives have been the mainstay of long-termmanagement of PCOS by decreasing LH and FSH secretionand ovarian production of androgens to reduce symptoms.This study compared the ISD metformin to the traditionaltherapy without conclusive results. PCOS is associatedwith increased insulin resistance and increased unbound androgen levels. Since this study was inconclusive, nursescan continue to counsel women to improve their lifestyle(e.g., diet, exercise, weight management) to avoid healthproblems later in life related to diabetes and heart disease. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 7.2 Are Insulin-Sensitizing Drugs More Effective Than the Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill in Minimizing Hirsutism, Acne, Risk of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Endometrial Cancer in PCOS? BOX 7.3 Treatment Modalities for PCOS Oral contraceptives to treat menstrual irregularities and acne Mechanical hair removal (shaving, waxing, plucking, or electrolysis) to treat hirsutism Glucophage (metformin), which improves insulin uptake by fat and muscle cells, to treat hyperinsuline- mia; thiazolinediones (Actos, Avandia) to decrease insulin resistance Ovulation induction agents (Clomid) to treat infertility Lifestyle changes (e.g., weight loss; exercise; balanced, low-fat diet) Referral to support groups to help improve emotional state and build self-esteem Sources: 2:45 PM Page 185Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies The physical examination includes inspection, ausculta- tion, and palpation of the abdomen because large ovar-ian masses may cause visible changes in the abdomen. Acomplete pelvic examination is performed to assess thelocation, size, shape, texture, mobility, and tenderness ofany palpable mass. Diagnostic tests include a pregnancy test to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing iswarranted if an ovarian abscess is suspected. An ultra-sound may be ordered to differentiate between functionalor simple ovarian cysts and a solid tumor. Additional testsmay be performed depending on the ndings. Remember Liz, the client with irregular menses, facial hair, and acne? Her glucose level is elevated, multiple cystswere felt on her ovaries during the pelvic examination, andlaboratory tests found elevated lipid and lipoprotein levels.What education should the nurse provide Liz regarding herPCOS diagnosis? What medications might be prescribed toaddress her abnormal laboratory values? Nursing Management Nursing care should include education about the condi- tion, treatment options, diagnostic test arrangements,and referral for surgery if needed. Provide support and re-assurance during the diagnostic period to allay anxiety inthe client and her family. Reassure the woman that themajority of ovarian cysts are benign, but regardless stressthe importance of follow-up care. Listen to the woman'sconcerns about her appearance, infertility, and facial hairgrowth. Offer suggestions to help the woman feel betterabout herself and her health. Nurses can have a positive impact on women with PCOS through counseling and education. Provide sup-port for women dealing with negative self-image second-ary to the physical manifestations of PCOS. Througheducation, help the woman understand the syndromeand its associated risk factors to prevent long-term healthproblems. Encourage the woman to make positive life-style changes. Make community referrals to local supportgroups to help the woman build her coping skills. Liz returns to the clinic a month later for re-evaluation of her PCOS. She has been taking metformin to reduce herinsulin resistance and has followed her exercise regimen andreduced her caloric intake to lose weight, but she stillcomplains about her facial hair and acne. What interventionsmight be helpful to address this problem? What medicationmight also be prescribed to regularize her menses and relievethe hirsutism?186 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Pelvic support disorders such as pelvic organ prolapse and urinary and fecal incontinence are prevalent condi-tions in aging women.

But when it involves areproductive organ, this fear is often magnied.11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 189ancer is the second leading cause of death for women in the United States, surpassed only by cardiovascular dis-ease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],2007b). Cardiovascular disease is and should continueto be a major focus of efforts in women's health. How-ever, this should not overshadow the fact that many women between the ages of 35 and 74 are developing anddying of cancer (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2007a).Women have a one-in-three lifetime risk of developing cancer, and one out of every four deaths is from cancer(Alexander et al., 2007). African-American women have the highest death rates from both heart disease and cancer(CDC, 2007b). According to the American Cancer Soci-ety (2008), it is estimated that over 39,000 new cases ofuterine cancer (6% of all cancers) and over 22, 000 casesof ovarian cancer (3% of all cancers) will be diagnosedin 2007, with the number of estimated deaths to be over7,000 and 15,000 respectively. It has been estimated that in the United States half of all premature deaths, one third of acute disabilities,and one half of chronic disabilities are preventable (NCI, 2007a). Nurses need to focus their energies on screening,education, and early detection to reduce these numbers.Because cancer risk is strongly associated with lifestyleand behavior, screening programs are of particular impor-tance for early detection. There is evidence that preventionand early detection have reduced cancer mortality ratesand prevented reproductive cancers (CDC, 2007b). This chapter begins with a nursing process overview of the care of women with reproductive cancer. It thendescribes selected cancers of the reproductive system\u2014ovarian, endometrial, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer.The chapter discusses the nurse's role through diagnosis,intervention, and follow-up care. Cancer management re-quires a multidisciplinary approach, including specialists in surgical, medical, and radiation oncology. The nursecan provide guidance and support to the client as she ndsher way through the health care maze. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE WOMAN WITHCANCER OF THE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT The word \"cancer\" is laden with fear and dread. These feelings may be worsened when the cancer involves awoman's reproductive tract. The diagnosis of a reproduc-tive tract cancer can have a profound impact on a woman'ssexuality because it affects the very core of her identityas a female. The loss of the reproductive body part as wellas the possible loss of childbearing ability can have a sig-nicant effect on women and their partners. Nurses needto remember this impact when counseling women andtheir partners about cancer treatment and side effects andchanges in gender roles and sexuality.190 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN When a woman is first diagnosed with a reproduc- tive tract cancer, two primary needs arise: informationand emotional support. When the diagnosis is made,the woman typically has many questions, such as, \"Whatis going to happen to me?\", \"How will this change my life?,\" and \"Will I survive?\" Nurses can play a major rolein helping women nd the answers to their questions anddirecting them to the resources they need. Two reliablesources of general cancer information are the NationalCancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society(ACS). They can be reached via the Internet or by phone. The nurse also plays a key role in offering emotional support, determining appropriate sources of support, andhelping the woman use effective coping strategies. Manyresearch studies have found that social support from thewoman's family, friends, and coworkers is one of thestrongest predictors of how well she will cope (Fieler &Henry, 2007). Women without a social support networkmay need a social work referral or may need to be guidedtoward support groups to receive the emotional supportthey need. In addition, cancer clients have a strong need for hope. Strategies for inspiring hope may include active listening,touch, presence, and helping clients overcome commu-nication barriers. Often it is not what nurses say or do butjust their presence that counts. Assessment Assessment of a woman with cancer of the reproductivetract involves a thorough history and physical examination.In addition, various laboratory and diagnostic tests may bedone to evaluate for a malignancy. Health History and Physical Examination Interview the woman carefully to determine any current orpast factors that might increase her risk of cancer, suchas early menarche, late menopause, sexually transmittedinfections, use of hormonal agents, or infertility. Findout if the woman has a family history of cancer. Be thor-ough in obtaining the woman's past medical history, espe-cially her reproductive, obstetric, and gynecologic history.Ask about her lifestyle and behaviors, including riskybehaviors such as engaging in unprotected sexual inter-course or sexual intercourse with multiple partners. Find out if she has had routine or recommended screeningprocedures. Ask if the woman has had any symptoms, such as abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge or vaginal dis-comfort. Often the symptoms of cancer are vague andnonspecic and the woman may attribute them to anotherproblem, such as aging, stress, or improper diet. Perform a complete physical examination, includ- ing a review of body systems and a pelvic examination.Observe for lesions or masses in the perineal area. Noteany masses when palpating the abdomen or when per-forming the pelvic examination.C11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 190Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Some of the laboratory and diagnostic tests used to help diagnose cancer of the reproductive tract are discussed inCommon Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 8.1. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Decient knowledge Disturbed body image Anxiety Fear Pain Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the woman with a reproductive cancer are based on the nurs-CHAPTER 8 CANCERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 191 Test Clinical breast examination Mammography Pap smear Transvaginal ultrasound CA-125Explanation Assessment of the breast for abnormal ndings; patientmay discover lump herself;high-risk history for breastcancer Screening modality for breast cancer or any distortion inbreast tissue architecture Cervical cytology screening to diagnose cervical cancers Screening for pelvic pathol- ogy to assist in diagnosingendometrial cancers Nonspecic blood test used as a tumor markerIndications Identies palpable mass, skin change, inverted nipple, orunresolved rash Detects calcifications, densi- ties, and nonpalpablecancer lesions Aids in detecting abnormal cells of the cervix (fromsquamocolumnar junctionof the cervix; most cervicalcancers arise here) Allows measurement of endometrial thickness todetermine if endometrialbiopsy is needed for post-menopausal bleeding Elevation of marker suggests malignancy but is not specic to ovarian cancer.Nursing Implications Educate client to perform breast self-examination andreport any abnormalities. Reinforce need for frequent clinical breast examinations ifrisk factors are present. Stress importance of annual mammograms for all womenafter the age of 40 or 50, depending on their risk history. Encourage all sexually active women to receive an annualpelvic examination, includinga Pap smear, to promoteearly detection of cervicalcancer. Review the risk factors for the development of endometrialcancer and reason for thisscreening test. Assist in preparing the patient for this examination. Review risk factors for ovarian cancer and explain that aseries of diagnostic tests maybe performed (transvaginalultrasound, CT scan, CA-125)to assist in the diagnosis andtreatment plan. Elevated marker levels are not specic to ovarian cancer; theycan be elevated in other typesof cancer.COMMON LABORATORY TESTS 8.1ing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 8.1 may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the woman with a re-productive cancer. It should be individualized based onthe woman's symptoms and needs. Nurses have traditionally served as advocates in the health care arena and should continue to be on the fore-front of health education and diagnosis, acting as leaders inthe ght against cancer. Over a half-million women in theUnited States will be diagnosed with cancer this year alone,and more than half will die of it. The public needs to knowthat not only are these deaths preventable, but many of thecancers themselves are preventable. Nurses need to workto improve the availability and quality of cancer-screeningservices, making them accessible to underserved and socio-economically disadvantaged clients. Through a unifiedeffort by health care professionals, health policy experts,government agencies, health insurance companies, the11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 191192 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Nursing Care Plan 8.1 OVERVIEW OF A WOMAN WITH AREPRODUCTIVE TRACTCANCER Molly, a thin 28-year-old woman, comes to the free health clinic complaining of a thin, watery vaginal discharge and spotting after sex. She says she is homeless and has lived \"on the streets\" for years. Molly says she has had multiple sexpartners to pay for her food and cigarettes. She had an abnormal Pap smear \"a while back\" but didn't return to the clinicfor follow-up. She hopes nothing \"bad\" is wrong with her because she just found a job that will allow her to get off thestreets. \"I'm worried that I won't be the same if there is something wrong. I don't know what I'd do if there is a problem,\"she tells you. Cervical cancer is suspected. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to uncertainty of diagnosis, possible diagnosis of cancer, and eventual outcome as evidenced by client's report of signs and symptoms, statements of being worried and not knowing what she would do Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will demonstrate measures to cope with anxiety as evidenced by statements acknowledging anxiety, use of positive coping strategies, and verbalization that anxiety has decreased. Interventions: Reducing Anxiety Encourage client to express her feelings and concerns to reduce her anxiety and to determine appropriate interventions. Assess the meaning of the diagnosis to the client, clarify misconceptions, and provide reliable, realistic information to enhance her understanding of her condition, subsequently reducing her anxiety. Assess client's psychological status to determine degree of emotional distress related to diagnosis and treatment options. Identify and address verbalized concerns, providing information about what to expect to decrease uncertainty about the unknown. Assess the client's use of coping mechanisms in the past and their effectiveness to foster use of positive strategies. Teach client about early signs of anxiety and help her recognize them (e.g., fast heartbeat, sweating, or feeling flushed) to minimize escalation of anxiety. Provide positive reinforcement that the client's condition can be managed to relieve her anxiety. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Decient knowledge related to diagnosis, prevention strategies, disease course, and treatment as evidenced by client's statements about hoping nothing bad is wrong, lack of follow-up for previous abnormal Pap test, and high-risk behaviors Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will demonstrate understanding of diagnosis, as evidenced by making health-promoting lifestyle choices, verbalizing appropriate health care practices, describing condition once diagnosed, and adhering to measures to comply with therapy. Interventions: Providing Client Teaching Assess client's current knowledge about her diagnosis and proposed therapeutic regimen to establish a baseline from which to develop a teaching plan. Review contributing factors associated with development of reproductive tract cancer, including lifestyle behaviors, to foster an understanding of the etiology of cervical cancer. Review information about treatments and procedures and recommendations for healthy lifestyle, obtaining feedbackfrequently to validate adequate understanding of instructions. Discuss strategies, including using condoms and limiting the number of sexual partners, to reduce the risk of transmission of STIs, including human papillomavirus (HPV), which is associated with cervical cancer. Encourage client to obtain prompt treatment of any vaginal or cervical infections to minimize the risk for cervical cancer. Urge the client to have an annual Pap smear to allow screening and early detection. Describe the treatment measures used to provide client with knowledge of what may be necessary. Provide written material with pictures to allow for client review and help her visualize what is occurring in her body. Inform client about available community resources and make appropriate referrals as needed to provide additional education and support. Document details of teaching and learning to allow for continuity of care and further education, if needed.11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 192media, educational institutions, and women themselves, along with consistency and continuity, nurses can offerquality care to all women with cancer. Educating to Prevent Cancer Nurses need to provide clients with information to help prevent disease and enhance quality of life. Educate womenabout the importance of consistent and timely screeningsto identify cancer early. Emphasize the importance of hav-ing an annual pelvic examination. Also stress the need forfollow-up screenings as recommended. Provide clients withinformation if further diagnostic testing is required. Nurses also play a key role in promoting cancer aware- ness, prevention, and control. Advocate to improve the availability of cancer-screening services and work to pro-vide public education about risk factors for cancer. Nurses can be instrumental in helping women to iden- tify and change behaviors that put them at risk for variousreproductive tract cancers (Teaching Guidelines 8.1).Do not limit your interventions to providing preventiveeducation only: inform women about the consequencesof doing nothing about their conditions and what the long-range outcomes might be without treatment. For example,stress the importance of visiting a health care professionalif certain signs and symptoms appear: Blood in a bowel movement Unusual vaginal discharge or chronic vulvar itching Persistent abdominal bloating or constipation Irregular vaginal bleeding Persistent low backache not related to standing Elevated or discolored vulvar lesions Bleeding after menopause Pain or bleeding after sexual intercourseCHAPTER 8 CANCERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 193 Teaching the Client About Her Diagnosis Provide information about tests that may be required to conrm or rule out the diagnosis. Review with the womanwhat she has been told about her diagnosis and her under-standing of her condition. It is not unusual for the womanto hear the diagnosis and then become overwhelmed bythe thought of cancer, blocking out whatever is said afterNursing Care Plan 8.1 (continued) NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Disturbed body image related to suspected reproductive tract cancer and impact on client's sexuality and sense of self as evidenced by statement of being worried about not being the same Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will verbalize or demonstrate a positive self-esteem in relation to body image as evidenced by positive statementsabout self, sexuality, and participation in activities with others. Interventions: Promoting Healthy Body Image Assess client's use of self-criticism to determine client's current state of coping and adjustment. Determine if the client's change in body image has contributed to social isolation to provide a direction for care. Provide opportunities for client to explore her feelings related to issues of sexuality, including past behaviors that may have placed her at risk, to minimize feelings of guilt about her condition. Acknowledge the client's feelings about possible changes in her body and sexuality and her illness to foster trust and allow client to ventilate feelings and concerns. Facilitate contact with other clients with the same type of cancer to promote sharing of feelings and decrease feelings of isolation. Initiate referrals for counseling and community support groups as necessary to assist client in gaining a positive image of herself. TEACHING GUIDELINES 8.1 Reducing Your Risk for Cancer Don't smoke. Drink alcohol only in moderation (no more than one drink daily). Be physically active daily. Eat a healthy diet. Stay current with immunizations. Reach and maintain a healthy weight. Take preventive medicines if needed. Get recommended screening tests: Body mass index (BMI) to identify obesity Mammogram every 1 to 2 years starting at age 40 Pap smear every 1 to 3 years if sexually active, between the ages of 21 and 65 Cholesterol checked annually starting at age 45 Blood pressure checked at least every 2 years Diabetes test if hypertensive or hypercholesterolemic Check for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 2:49 PM Page 193that. Answer any questions she may have. Go slowly and repeat the information as necessary. Use written materi-als to explain and reinforce the teaching. Provide infor-mation about her condition and recommended therapies.For example, if a client is undergoing surgery, discuss post-operative issues such as incision care, pain, and activitylevel. Instruct the client on health maintenance activitiesafter treatment, and inform her and her family about avail-able support resources. Providing Emotional Support Once the diagnosis is made, provide the woman and her family with emotional support. Validate the client's feel-ings and provide realistic hope, using a nonjudgmentalapproach and therapeutic communication skills during allinteractions. Individualize the care based on the client'scultural traditions and beliefs. Ensuring Culturally Competent Cancer Care Cultural diversity in America is increasing, and as diverse cultures interact, conflicts inevitably ensue. These conflictscan affect health care outcomes. Providing culturally com-petent cancer care can improve outcomes and decrease disparities in care. Work to develop cultural competenceby learning about and showing respect for all cultures. Beaware of the client's cultural background, religion, migra-tion history, degree of acculturation, living conditions,educational level, and legal status, because each of thesefactors can affect the client's understanding of her diagno-sis and the eventual outcome (Jenko & Moftt, 2006). In some cultures, sharing news of a serious illness like cancer is considered disrespectful and impolite. For ex-ample, some Europeans view such sharing as inhumane;the Asian culture views a cancer diagnosis as unnecessar-ily cruel. The Chinese, out of respect for aging familymembers, withhold discussions of serious illness to avoidcausing unnecessary anxieties (Surbone, 2006). Integratethis knowledge in your care to ensure a culturally compe-tent approach.194 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Supporting the Pregnant Woman With Cancer Theoretically, changes in the mother's immune system during pregnancy can increase the risk of malignancybecause cell-mediated immunity, which is suppressedin pregnant women, normally protects against canceroustumors (Blackburn, 2007). Some research has hinted atan increased rate of progression and decreased survivaltimes in women who develop breast and cervical cancerand then become pregnant, but this generally has notbeen validated by research studies. Ovarian cancer during pregnancy is rare because the disease typically occurs in older women. Because mostpregnant women receive frequent medical care, includ-ing pelvic examinations, most ovarian cancers in preg-nant women are found at early stages; this carries agood prognosis for both the mother and the newborn(Machado et al., 2007). Since routine screening for en-dometrial cancer is currently not recommended in the general population, few cases would be detected in therelatively young pregnant population (Sonoda & Barakat,2006). Cervical cancer is more common in the pregnantpopulation than other reproductive malignancies, and itcan affect the woman's health status and the pregnancy. Women diagnosed with any malignancy during preg- nancy must confront the reality of the disease and its impact on their future fertility and live with the risk ofrecurrence (Roberts, Rezai, & Edmondson, 2007). Thewishes of the pregnant woman and her family are of para-mount importance when making decisions about contin-uing the pregnancy and undergoing cancer treatment. Some women will decide to terminate the pregnancy forthe sake of their own health; others will undergo treatmentduring the pregnancy to preserve the life of the unbornchild. Regardless of the woman's decision, provide supportand education during treatment, birth, and beyond. Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is malignant neoplastic growth of the ovary (Fig. 8.1). It is the eighth most common canceramong women and the fth most common cause of cancerdeaths for women in the United States. It accounts formore deaths than any other cancer of the reproductivesystem (ACS, 2007c). The ACS estimates that about 23,000 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed inthe United States during 2007 and 15,000 deaths willoccur. A woman's risk of getting ovarian cancer during herlifetime is 1.5%, or about 1 in 67. About 76% of womenwith ovarian cancer survive 1 year after diagnosis; only45% survive longer than 5 years (ACS, 2007c). Olderwomen are at highest risk. Ovarian cancer occurs mostfrequently in women between 55 and 75 years of age, andapproximately 25% of ovarian cancer deaths occur inwomen between 35 and 54 years old (ACS, 2007c). When a diagnosis of cancer is made, assessing an individual's strengths and weaknesses from a cultural perspective will help thenurse to provide culturally competent care.Take NOTE! As life becomes increasingly multilingual, multi- cultural, and multi-faith, learning about clients' valuesand cultural beliefs becomes challenging. Be willing tolearn about client preferences; doing so promotes caringand nurturing.11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 194The most important variable influencing the prog- nosis is the extent of the disease. Survival depends on thestage of the tumor, grade of differentiation, gross find-ings at surgery, amount of residual tumor after surgery,and effectiveness of any adjunct treatment postoperatively.Many women with ovarian cancer will experience recur-rence despite the best efforts of eradicating the cancerthrough surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy to eliminateresidual tumor cells. The likelihood of long-term survivalin the event of recurrence is dismal (Eaton, 2007). The5-year survival rates (the percentage of women who live atleast 5 years after their diagnosis) are shown in Table 8.1according to stage.CHAPTER 8 CANCERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 195 Pathophysiology Ovarian cancer, the cause of which is unknown, can orig- inate from different cell types. Most ovarian cancers orig-inate in the ovarian epithelium. They usually present assolid masses that have spread beyond the ovary and seededinto the peritoneum prior to diagnosis. An inherited geneticmutation is the causative factor in 5% to 10% of cases ofepithelial ovarian cancer. Screening and Diagnosis Seventy-ve percent of ovarian cancers are not diagnoseduntil the cancer has advanced to stage III or IV, primarilybecause there is still no adequate screening test. Two genes,BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, are linked with hereditary breastand ovarian cancers. Blood tests can be performed to assessDNA in white blood cells to detect mutations in the BRCAgenes. These genetic markers do not predict whether theperson will develop cancer; rather, they provide informa-tion regarding the risk of developing cancer: a womanwho is BRCA positive may have up to an 80% chance ofdeveloping breast cancer and a 40% chance of developingovarian cancer (Eaton, 2007). To assist in screening, researchers have been develop- ing an ovarian cancer symptom index that includes pelvicand abdominal pain, urinary frequency and urgency, in-creased abdominal size (bloating), and difculty eating(feeling full) (Goff et al., 2007). The symptom index isconsidered positive if any of these symptoms occur moreFIGURE8.1Ovarian cancer. (The Anatomical Chart Company. [2005]. Atlas of pathophysiology [2nd ed.].

The utility of this symptom index as a general screeningtool remains to be assessed. Specic clinical guidelines for ovarian cancer screen- ing have not been developed, so the disease is often notdiagnosed until it has metastasized. The U.S. PreventiveServices Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against rou-tinescreening for ovarian cancer with serum CA-125 or transvaginal ultrasound because earlier detection wouldhave a small effect, at best, on mortality. CA-125 is abiologic tumor marker associated with ovarian cancer.Although levels are elevated in many women with ovar- ian cancer, CA-125 is not specic for this cancer and lev-els may be elevated with other malignancies (pancreatic,liver, colon, breast, and lung cancers). Currently, it is notsensitive enough to serve as a screening tool (Speroff &Fritz, 2005). The USPSTF concluded that the harm fromthe invasive nature of the diagnostic tests would outweighthe benets (USPSTF, 2006). Therapeutic Management Treatment options for ovarian cancer vary depending onthe stage and severity of the disease. Usually a laparoscopy(abdominal exploration with an endoscope) is performed for diagnosis and staging, as well as evaluation for therapy.In stage I the cancer is limited to the ovaries. In stage IIthe growth involves one or both ovaries, with pelvic ex-tension. Stage III cancer has spread to the lymph nodesand other organs or structures inside the abdominalcavity. In stage IV, the cancer has metastasized to dis-tant sites (Alexander et al., 2007). Figure 8.2 shows thelikely metastatic sites for ovarian cancer.196 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Diaphragm LiverSerosal bowel implants Colon Nodes OvariesPleura Omentum Stomach Pelvic peritoneal implant FIGURE8.2Common metastatic sites for ovarian cancer. (The Anatomical Chart Company. [2005]. Atlas of pathophysiology [2nd ed.]. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams (continued)Surgical intervention remains the mainstay of man- agement of ovarian cancer. Surgery generally includesa total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal biopsies, omentectomy, andpelvic para-aortic lymph node sampling to evaluate cancerextension (Martin, 2007). Because most women are di-agnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, aggressive management involving debulking or cytoreductive surgeryis commonly performed. This surgery involves resect-ing all visible tumors from the peritoneum, taking peri-toneal biopsies, sampling lymph nodes, and removingall reproductive organs and the omentum. This aggres-sive surgery has been shown to improve long-term sur-vival rates. Additional therapy with radiation may be warranted. Chemotherapy is recommended for all stages of ovariancancer. Nursing Assessment Ovarian cancers are considered the worst of all the gy-necologic malignancies, primarily because they developslowly and remain silent and without symptoms until thecancer is far advanced. It has been described as \"the over-looked disease\" or \"the silent killer\" because women andhealth care practitioners often ignore or rationalize earlysymptoms. For example, women may attribute gastro-intestinal problems to stress and midlife changes. How- ever, these vague complaints may precede more obvioussymptoms by months. The most common early symptomsinclude abdominal bloating, early satiety, fatigue, vagueabdominal pain, urinary frequency, diarrhea or consti-pation, and unexplained weight loss or gain. The later symptoms include anorexia, dyspepsia, ascites, a palpableabdominal mass, pelvic pain, and back pain (Wallace &Sanford, 2006). Consider THIS! I felt I was a lucky woman because I had been in remission from breast cancer for 12 years, and I hadbeen given the gift of life to share with my belovedfamily. Recently I became ill with stomach problems:pain, indigestion, bloating, and nausea. My doctortreated me for GERD (acid reflux disease), but thesymptoms persisted. I then was referred to a gastro-enterologist, an urologist, and then a gynecologist, who did an ultrasound, which was negative. I receivedreassurance from all three that there was nothing wrongwith me. As time went by, I experienced more pain,more symptoms, and increased frustration. Six monthsafter seeing all three specialists, a repeat ultrasoundrevealed I had ovarian cancer, and I needed surgery assoon as possible. I underwent a complete hysterectomy 11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 196A small on ultra- sound in an asymptomatic postmenopausal woman should arouse suspicion. Any mass or ovarypalpated in a postmenopausal woman should be considered cancerous until proven otherwise (Cherry,DeGaetano, & Martin, 2007).Take NOTE! CHAPTER 8 CANCERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 197 seemingly innocuous symptoms as \"just a part of aging.\" Encourage women to describe such nonspecic com-plaints at health visits. Assess the woman's family and personal history for risk factors and encourage genetic testing for womenwith affected family members. Outline screening guide-lines for women with hereditary cancer syndrome andinform women at high risk about the appropriate screen-ing strategies. Urge women to have yearly bimanual pelvic examina- tions and a transvaginal ultrasound to allow identicationof ovarian masses in their early stages. After menopause,a mass on an ovary is not a cyst: physiologic cysts can ariseonly from a follicle that has not ruptured or from thecystic degeneration of the corpus luteum. Educating the Client Education is a major focus of nursing care. This teach-ing involves risk reduction and health promotion. Teachthe woman about risk-reduction strategies; for instance,pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives, and breastfeeding reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. Instruct women toavoid using talc and hygiene sprays on their genitals.Review the lifetime risks related to BRCA-1 and BRCA-2genes and options available should the woman test pos-itive for these genes. Help to promote community aware-ness of ovarian cancer by educating the public aboutrisk-reducing behaviors. Instruct the woman about the importance of healthy lifestyles. Stress the importance of maintaining a healthyweight to reduce risk. Encourage women to eat a low-fat diet. For the woman who is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, describe in simple terms the tests, treatment modalities,and follow-up needed. For example, if the woman will behaving surgery, provide thorough teaching about what toexpect before, during, and after surgery. Outline treatmentoptions and the implications of choices. Assist the womanand her family to decipher the myriad of information re-lated to staging, tests, and treatments. Teach the womanabout additional treatment measures, such as radiationtherapy or chemotherapy, including how to handle thecommon adverse effects of treatment.Consider THIS! (continued) and my surgeon found I was in stage 3. Since then, I have undergone chemotherapy and participated in aclinical cancer study that wasn't successful for me, andnow I am facing the fact that I am going to die soon. Thoughts: This woman has tried everything to save her life, but, alas, time has run out for her withadvanced ovarian cancer. Women diagnosed withbreast cancer are at a significant risk for developingovarian cancer later in life. Of the string of doctorsshe saw, one has to ponder why none ordered a CA-125blood test with her history of breast cancer. We arehaunted with the question: If they had and it was elevated, would she be in stage 3 now? I guess we will never know. Obtain a thorough history of the woman's symptoms, including their onset, duration, and frequency. Reviewthe woman's history for risk factors such as: Nulliparity Early menarche (before 12 years old) Late menopause (after 55 years old) Increasing age (over 50 years of age) High-fat diet Obesity Persistent ovulation over time First-degree relative with ovarian cancer Use of perineal talcum powder or hygiene sprays Older than 30 years at rst pregnancy Positive BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations Personal history of breast, bladder, or colon cancer Hormone replacement therapy for more than 10 years Infertility (CDC, 2007c) Perform a complete physical examination. Inspect the abdomen, noting any distention or bloating. Palpate theabdomen. Be alert for a mass or pain on palpation. Antic-ipate further testing to conrm the diagnosis. Nursing Management The complexities of ovarian cancer make a multidiscipli-nary approach necessary for optimal management. Withthe subtle nature and high risk of recurrence and mortalityof this condition, most women nd it an emotionally ex-hausting and devastating experience. Nursing managementfocuses on measures to promote early detection, educatethe woman about the disease and its treatments, and pro-vide emotional support. Nurses should show a positive at-titude that communicates understanding and reassurance. Promoting Early Detection Nurses need to ensure that women are aware of the riskfactors for ovarian cancer. Urge women not to dismiss11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 197Supporting the Client and Family The diagnosis of ovarian cancer, like any cancer, can be overwhelming. In addition, the treatments and their effectscan be highly stressful, both physically and emotionally.Provide one-to-one support for women facing treatmentfor ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer involves the reproduc-tive system, which has a direct impact on the woman'sview of herself. Encourage open discussion of sexuality andthe impact of cancer. Listen and support the woman andher family as they try to cope with this disease. Encouragethe use of appropriate coping strategies to allow for the bestquality of life. Try to restore hope to women with ovariancancer, and stress treatment compliance. If appropriate,encourage participation in clinical trials to offer hope forall women. Continue to offer support to the woman andher family members as they experience sadness and grief. Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer (also known as uterine cancer) is malignant neoplastic growth of the uterine lining. It isthe most common gynecologic malignancy and accounts for 6% of all cancers in women in the United States. TheNCI estimates that there will be over 40,000 new casesin 2007; approximately 8,000 of these women will die(NCI, 2007b). It is uncommon before the age of 40, but as women age, their risk of endometrial cancer increases.Approximately 95% of these malignancies are carcino-mas of the endometrium. Because endometrial cancer isusually diagnosed in the early stages, it has a better prog-nosis than cervical or ovarian cancer (ACS, 2007f). Pathophysiology Two mechanisms are believed to be involved in the devel-opment of endometrial cancer. A history of exposure tounopposed estrogen is the cause in 75% of women. Those that are spontaneous and are unrelated to estrogen orendometrial hyperplasia represent the other 25% of endo-metrial cancers. Endometrial cancer may originate in a polyp or in a diffuse multifocal pattern. The pattern of spread partiallydepends on the degree of cellular differentiation. Well-differentiated tumors tend to limit their spread to the sur-face of the endometrium. Metastatic spread occurs in acharacteristic pattern and most commonly involves thelungs, inguinal and supraclavicular nodes, liver, bones,brain, and vagina (NCI, 2007b). Early tumor growth ischaracterized by friable and spontaneous bleeding. Latertumor growth is characterized by myometrial invasion andgrowth toward the cervix (Fig. 8.3). Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is typically pre- ceded by hyperplasia. Carcinoma in situ is found only on the endometrial surface. In stage I, it has spread to themuscle wall of the uterus. In stage II, it has spread to the cervix. In stage III, it has spread to the bowel or vagina, with metastases to pelvic lymph nodes. In stage IV, it has198 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN invaded the bladder mucosa, with distant metastases to the lungs, liver, and bone (Burke & Gallup, 2007). Type I carcinomas, the most common, begin as en- dometrial hyperplasia and progress to carcinomas. Givingestrogen preparations without progestin for hormone re-placement therapy leads to an increased risk for endome-trial cancer. Type I is generally found at an earlier stage andtreatment results are more favorable. Unlike type I endometrial carcinoma, type II carcino- mas appear spontaneously, are associated with a poorly differentiated cell type, and have a poor prognosis (Burke& Gallup, 2007). They account for less than 10% of allendometrial cancers but contribute to the majority of allendometrial deaths. Screening and Diagnosis Remember Carmella, the woman with postmenopausal bleeding? In postmenopausal women, any bleeding isabnormal and warrants further assessment. What testingwould the nurse anticipate as being ordered to conrm thediagnosis? What would be the nurse's role during this testing? Screening for endometrial cancer is not routinely done because it is not practical or cost-effective. The ACS rec-ommends that women should be informed about the risksand symptoms of endometrial cancer at the onset of meno-pause and strongly encouraged to report any unexpectedbleeding or spotting to their health care provider (ACS,2007f). A pelvic examination is frequently normal in theearly stages of the disease. Changes in the size, shape, orconsistency of the uterus or its surrounding support struc-tures may exist when the disease is more advanced. An endometrial biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice. It can be done in the health care provider's ofcewithout anesthesia. A slender suction catheter is used toobtain a small sample of tissue for pathology. This testcan detect up to 90% of cases of endometrial cancer inwomen with postmenopausal bleeding, depending onthe technique and experience of the health care provider(Wallace & Sanford, 2006). The woman may experiencemild cramping and bleeding after the procedure for about24 hours, but typically mild pain medication will reducethis discomfort. Transvaginal ultrasound can be used to evaluate the endometrial cavity and measure the thickness of the endometrial lining. It can be used to detect endometrial hyperplasia. If the endometrium measures less than 4 mm,then the client is at low risk for malignancy (Sonoda &Barakat, 2006). Therapeutic Management Typically, the stage of the disease directs treatment. Itusually involves surgery with adjunct therapy based onpathologic ndings. Surgery most often involves removal11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 198of the uterus (hysterectomy) and the fallopian tubes and ovaries (salpingo-oophorectomy). Removal of the tubesand ovaries is recommended because tumor cells spread early to the ovaries, and any dormant cancer cells couldbe stimulated to grow by ovarian estrogen. In more ad-CHAPTER 8 CANCERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 199 vanced cancers, radiation and chemotherapy are used as adjuncts to surgery. Routine surveillance intervals forfollow-up care are typically every 3 to 4 months for the rst2 years, since 85% of recurrences occur in the rst 3 yearsafter diagnosis (Burke & Gallup, 2007). Fundus Sarcoma Ovary Late endometrial cancer VaginaEndometrium cells Endometrial cancerAdvanced endometrial cancer FIGURE8.3Progression of endometrial cancer. 199Any episode of bright-red bleeding that occurs after menopause should be investi- gated. Abnormal uterine bleeding is rarely the result of uterine malignancy in a young woman, but in thepostmenopausal woman it should be regarded with suspicion.Take NOTE! Nursing Assessment Obtain a thorough history from the woman, ascertain-ing her primary complaint. Most commonly, the majorinitial symptom of endometrial cancer is abnormal andpainless vaginal bleeding. Also review the woman's history for any risk factors, including: Nulliparity Obesity (more than 50 pounds overweight) Liver disease Infertility Diabetes mellitus Hypertension History of pelvic radiation Polycystic ovary syndrome Infertility Early menarche (before 12 years old) High-fat diet Use of prolonged exogenous unopposed estrogen with an intact uterus Endometrial hyperplasia Family history of endometrial cancer Personal history of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer Personal history of breast or ovarian cancer Late onset of menopause (after age 52 years) Tamoxifen use Chronic anovulation (Tiffen & Mahon, 2006) Assess the woman for additional manifestations, such as dyspareunia, low back pain, purulent genital dis-charge, dysuria, pelvic pain, weight loss, and a change inbladder and bowel habits. These may suggest advanceddisease. Perform a physical examination and assist with or per- form, as appropriate, a pelvic examination. Observe for vaginal discharge. Note any changes in the size, shape,or consistency of the uterus or surrounding structures orclient reports of pain during examination. Anticipate theneed for transvaginal ultrasound to identify endometrialhyperplasia (usually greater than 4 mm) and endometrialbiopsy to identify malignant cells.200 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Nursing Management Ensure that the woman understands all the treatment options. Address any concerns the woman expresses, in-cluding those of a sexual nature. Ensure that follow-upappointments are scheduled appropriately. Refer the clientto a support group. Offer the woman and family explana-tions and emotional support throughout. Educate the client about preventive measures or follow-up care if she has been treated for cancer. Edu-cation may be the most important tool currently avail- able for the early detection of endometrial cancer. Manyrisk factors for endometrial cancer are modiable, includ- ing obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Educating women about risk factors and ways to decrease the risks is essen-tial so that women can learn about their own risk andcan become partners in the fight against the number-one gynecologic cancer (Teaching Guidelines 8.2). TEACHING GUIDELINES 8.2 Preventive and Follow-Up Measures for Endometrial Cancer Schedule regular pelvic examinations after the age of 21. Visit health care practitioner for early evaluation ofany abnormal bleeding after menopause. Maintain a low-fat diet throughout life. Exercise daily. Manage weight to discourage hyperestrogenicstates, which predispose to endometrial hyperplasia. Pregnancy serves as a protective factor by reducingestrogen. Ask your doctor about the use of combination estrogen and progestin pills. When combination oral contraceptives are taken tofacilitate the regular shedding of the uterine lining,take risk-reduction measures. Be aware of risk factors for endometrial cancer andmake modications as needed. Report any of the following symptoms immediately: Bleeding or spotting after sexual intercourse Bleeding that lasts longer than a week Reappearance of bleeding after 6 months or moreof no menses After cancer therapy, schedule follow-up appoint-ments for the next few years. After cancer therapy, frequently communicate withyour health care provider concerning your status. After surgery, maintain a healthy weight. 11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 200Carmella's Her health care provider recommendssurgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. How long willCarmella need to follow up after surgery? What lifestylechanges will the nurse need to stress with Carmella? Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer is cancer of the uterine cervix. The ACS estimates that over 12,000 cases of invasive cervical cancerwill be diagnosed in the United States in 2007; approxi-mately 3,000 of these women will die. Some researchers estimate that noninvasive cervical cancer (carcinoma insitu) is about four times more common than invasive cer-vical cancer. The 5-year survival rate for all stages of cer-vical cancer is 72% (ACS, 2007a). It is ve to eight timesmore common in women affected with HIV or AIDSthan those who do not have this virus. The probability of awoman in the United States developing cervical cancer isapproximately 1 in 120, but this statistic is age-dependent;the highest incidence is in women 40 to 49 years of age(Hopkins & Sawa, 2007). The incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer have decreased noticeably in the past several decades, withmost of the reduction attributed to the Papanicolaou (Pap) test , which detects cervical cancer and precancer- ous lesions. Cervical cancer is one of the most treatablecancers when detected at an early stage (ACS, 2007a).Healthy People 2010 identies two goals that address cervi- cal cancer (Healthy People 2010 8.1; USDHHS, 2000).CHAPTER 8 CANCERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 201 Pathophysiology Cervical cancer starts with abnormal changes in the cellu- lar lining or surface of the cervix. Typically these changesoccur in the squamous-columnar junction of the cervix.Here, cylindrical secretory epithelial cells (columnar) meetthe protective flat epithelial cells (squamous) from the outercervix and vagina in what is termed the transformationzone. The continuous replacement of columnar epithe-lial cells by squamous epithelial cells in this area makesthese cells vulnerable to take up foreign or abnormal ge-netic material (ACS, 2007a). Figure 8.4 shows the patho-physiology of cervical cancer.Reduce the death rate from cancer of the uterine cervixfrom 3 per 100,000 females(1998) to 2 per 100,000 females in 2010.Increase the proportion ofwomen who received a Papsmear within the preceding3 years from 79% to 90% by 2010.Will help improve mortality rates and quality of life forwomen, and reduce health carecosts related to treatment ofmalignancies. Will help to promote screening and early detection. The NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) re-ported that half of women diagnosed with invasive cervicalcancer have never had a Papsmear and 10% have not hadPap smears during the past 5 years (NIH, 2007). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Objective Signicance Normal cells Pre-malignant cells Ectocervical lesionMalignant cells Carcinoma in situ Squamous cell carcinoma FIGURE 8.4Cervical cancer. (The Anatomical Chart Company. [2005]. Atlas of PM Page 201The development of cervical cancer has been linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV) , which is acquired through sexual activity (Torpy, 2007). More than 90% ofsquamous cervical cancers contain HPV DNA, and thevirus is now accepted as a major causative factor in the de-velopment of cervical cancer and its precursor, cervical dysplasia (disordered growth of abnormal cells). Screening and Diagnosis Screening for cervical cancer is very effective because the presence of a precursor lesion, cervical intraepithelial neo-plasia (CIN), helps determine whether further tests areneeded. Lesions start as dysplasia and progress in a pre-dictable fashion over a long period, allowing ample oppor-tunity for intervention at a precancerous stage. Progressionfrom low-grade to high-grade dysplasia takes an years, and progression from high-grade dysplasia to in-vasive cancer takes up to 2 years (Hopkins & Sawa, 2007). Widespread use of the Pap test (also known as a Pap smear), a procedure used to obtain cells from the cervixfor cytology screening, is credited with saving tens ofthousands of women's lives and decreasing deaths fromcervical cancer by more than 70% (ACS, 2007a). Despiteits outstanding record of success as a screening tool forcervical cancer (it detects approximately 90% of earlycancer changes), the conventional Pap smear has a 20%false-negative rate. High-grade abnormalities missed byhuman screening are frequently detected by computer-ized instruments (NCI, 2007a). Thus, many technolo-gies have been developed to improve the sensitivity andspecicity of Pap testing, including: Thin-Prep: In this liquid-based technique, the cervical specimen is placed into a vial of preservative solutionrather than on a glass slide. Computer-assisted automated Pap test rescreening (Autopap): An algorithm-based decision-makingtechnology identies slides that should be rescreenedby cytopathologists by selecting samples that exceed acertain threshold for the likelihood of abnormal cells. HPV-DNA typing (Hybrid Capture): This system uses the association between certain types of HPV(16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, and 56) and the development of cervical cancer. This system canidentify high-risk HPV types and improves detectionand CDS-1000, AutoCyte, AcCell): These detect abnormal cells that are sometimes missedby technologists (Wallace & Sanford, 2006). The high rate of false-negative results may also be due to other factors, including errors in sampling the cervix, inpreparing the slide, and in client preparation. Although professional medical organizations disagree as to the recommended frequency of screening for cervi-202 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN cal cancer, the ACS 2007 guidelines suggest that women should begin annual screening for cervical cancer via aPap test after they initiate sexual activity or at 21 yearsof age, whichever comes first. If three consecutive Papsmears are negative, a trained health care provider may suggest that screening can be performed less frequently.Women ages 65 to 70 with no abnormal tests in the previ-ous 10 years may choose to stop screenings (ACS, 2007a).High-risk women should continue to have annual Papsmears throughout their life (Table 8.2). Pap smear results are classied using the Bethesda Sys- tem ( Box 8.1), which provides a uniform diagnostic ter- minology that allows clear communication between thelaboratory and the health care provider. The informationprovided by the laboratory is divided into three categories:specimen adequacy, general categorization of cytologicndings, and interpretation/result (ACS, 2007b). Therapeutic Management Treatment for abnormal Pap smears depends on the sever-ity of the results and the health history of the woman. Ther-apeutic choices all involve destroying as many affected cellsas possible. Box 8.2 describes treatment options. Using the Bethesda system, the following manage- ment guidelines for abnormal Pap results were developedby the NCI to provide direction to health care providersand clients: ASC-US: Repeat the Pap smear in 4 to 6 months or refer for colposcopy. ASC-H: Refer for colposcopy without HPV testing. Atypical glandular and adenocarcinoma Immediate colposcopy; follow-up isbased on the ndings. Colposcopy is a microscopic examination of the lower genital tract using a magnifying instrument called a colpo-scope. Specic patterns of cells that correlate well with certain histologic ndings can be visualized.

Healing takes up to 6 weeks, and the clientmay experience a profuse, watery vaginal discharge for3 to 4 weeks. Cone Biopsy or conization \u2014removes a cone-shaped section of cervical tissue. The base of the cone is formedby the ectocervix (outer part of the cervix) and thepoint or apex of the cone is from the endocervical canal.The transformation zone is contained within the conesample. The cone biopsy is also a treatment and canbe used to completely remove any precancers andvery early cancers. There are two methods commonlyused for cone biopsies: LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) or LLETZ (large loop excision of the transformationzone)\u2014the abnormal cervical tissue is removed witha wire that is heated by an electrical current. For thisprocedure, a local anesthetic is used. It is performedin the health care provider's ofce in approximately10 minutes. Mild cramping and bleeding may persistfor several weeks after the procedure. Cold knife cone biopsy\u2014a surgical scalpel or a laser is used instead of a heated wire to remove tissue.This procedure requires general anesthesia and isdone in a hospital setting.

Cervical cancer rates have decreased in the United States because of the widespread use of Pap test-ing, which can detect precancerous lesions of the cervixbefore they develop into cancer. Nevertheless, during 2007,an estimated 12,000 new cases will be diagnosed andapproximately 3,800 women will die from cervical cancer(CDC, 2007a, 2007b; Advisory Committee on Immu-nization Practices [ACIP], 2007). Gardasil, the first vaccine developed to protect girls and women from HPV, is now available. The vaccineprevents infection from four HPV types: HPV 6, 11, 16,and 18. Theses types are responsible for 70% of cervicalcancers and 90% of genital warts (Snow, 2007). Clinicaltrials indicate that the vaccine has high efficacy in pre-venting persistent HPV infection, cervical cancer precur-sor lesions, vaginal and vulvar cancer precursor lesions,and genital warts (Bryan, 2007). The vaccine is adminis-tered by intramuscular injection, and the recommended schedule is a three-dose series with the second and thirddoses administered 2 and 6 months after the rst dose.The recommended age for vaccination of females is 11 to12 years old, but the vaccine can be administered to girlsas young as 9 years old (Pichichero, 2007). The long-termefcacy of HPV vaccines remains to be determined. Sus-tained efcacy up to 4.5 years has been documented, butit could be that boosters will be needed (CDC, 2007a).However, the vaccine is not a substitute for routine cervi-206 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN cal cancer screening, and vaccinated women should have Pap smears as recommended. Focus primary prevention education on the following: Identify high-risk behaviors in clients and teach them how to reduce them: Take steps to prevent STIs. Avoid early sexual activity. Faithfully use barrier methods of contraception. Avoid smoking and drinking. Receive the HPV vaccine. Instruct women on the importance of screening for cervical cancer by annual Pap smears. Outline theproper preparation before having a Pap smear(Teaching Guidelines 8.3). Reinforce specific guidelines for screening. Nurses also can advocate for clients by making sure that the Pap smear is sent to an accredited laboratory forinterpretation. Doing so reduces the risk of false-negativeresults. Secondary prevention focuses on reducing or limiting the area of cervical dysplasia. Tertiary prevention focuseson minimizing disability or spread of cervical cancer. Ex-plain in detail all procedures that might be needed.

Thetrials compared the anxiety levels of the intervention groupwith those of a control group. The methods used to reduceanxiety were informational leaflets, counseling, informa-tional videos, video during colposcopy, music, and verbalinformation.Findings Three methods were found to signicantly reduce anxiety during colposcopy: listening to music, watching informa-tional videos, and viewing the video during the procedure.Other methods, such as informational leaflets, counseling,and verbal information, were not found to reduce anxietyvs. control groups. Nursing Implications Nurses can use the information from this study to designappropriate strategies for client teaching and can encour-age women to use these measures to reduce anxiety. Forexample, the nurse can suggest that the client listen to herfavorite music during the procedure to help her relax.Nurses can urge women to seek agencies or settings thatinclude these measures as part of their procedure, andnurses can work with their facilities to ensure that music,informational videos, and videotape equipment are avail-able for use during this procedure.

It is rare, representing less than 3% of all genitalcancers. The ACS estimates that in 2007, over 2,000 newcases of vaginal cancer will be diagnosed in the UnitedStates, and approximately 800 will die of this cancer (ACS,2007d). The peak incidence of vaginal cancer occurs at60 to 65 years of age. The prognosis of vaginal cancer de-pends largely on the stage of disease and the type of tumor.The overall 5-year survival rate for squamous cell carci-noma is about 42%; that for adenocarcinoma is about 78%(NCI, 2007c). Vaginal cancer can be effectively treated,and when found early it is often curable. Pathophysiology The etiology of vaginal cancer has not been identified.Malignant diseases of the vagina are either primary vagi-nal cancers or metastatic forms from adjacent or distant organs. About 80% of vaginal cancers are metastatic, pri-marily from the cervix and endometrium. These cancersinvade the vagina directly. Cancers from distant sitesthat metastasize to the vagina through the blood or lym-phatic system are typically from the colon, kidneys, skin(melanoma), or breast. Tumors in the vagina commonly occur on the posterior wall and spread to the cervix orvulva (NCI, 2007c). Squamous cell carcinomas that begin in the epithe- lial lining of the vagina account for about 85% of vagi-nal cancers. This type of cancer usually occurs in womenover age 50. They develop slowly over a period of years,commonly in the upper third of the vagina. They tendto spread early by directly invading the bladder and rec-tal walls. They also metastasize through blood and lym- phatics. The remaining 15% are adenocarcinomas, which differ from squamous cell carcinoma by an increase inpulmonary metastases and supraclavicular and pelvicnode involvement (ACS, 2007d). Therapeutic Management Treatment of vaginal cancer depends on the type of cellsinvolved and the stage of the disease. If the cancer is local-ized, radiation, laser surgery, or both may be used. If the cancer has spread, radical surgery might be needed, suchas a hysterectomy, or removal of the upper vagina with dis-section of the pelvic nodes in addition to radiation therapy. Nursing Assessment Begin the history and physical examination by review-ing for risk factors. Although direct risk factors for theinitial development of vaginal cancer have not been iden-tied, associated risk factors include advancing age (over60 years old), previous pelvic radiation, exposure todiethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero, vaginal trauma, historyof genital warts (HPV infection), HIV infection, cervicalcancer, chronic vaginal discharge, smoking, and low socio-economic level (ACS, 2007d). Question the woman about any complaints. Most women with vaginal cancer are asymptomatic. Those withsymptoms have painless vaginal bleeding (often after sex-ual intercourse), abnormal vaginal discharge, dyspareu- nia, dysuria, constipation, and pelvic pain (NCI, 2007c).During the physical examination, observe for any obviousvaginal discharge or genital warts, or changes in the appear-ance of the vaginal mucosa. Anticipate colposcopy with biopsy of suspicious lesions to conrm the diagnosis. Nursing Management Nursing management for this cancer is similar to that forother reproductive cancers, with emphasis on sexualitycounseling and referral to local support groups. Womenundergoing radical surgery need intensive counseling aboutTEACHING GUIDELINES 8.3 Strategies to Optimize Pap Smear Results Schedule your Pap smear appointment about 2 weeks (10 to 18 days) after the rst day of yourlast menses to increase the chance of getting thebest sample of cervical cells without menses. Refrain from intercourse for 48 hours before thetest because additional matter such as sperm canobscure the specimen. Do not douche within 48 hours before the test to prevent washing away cervical cells that might beabnormal. Do not use tampons, birth control foams, jellies,vaginal creams, or vaginal medications for 72 hoursbefore the test, as they could cover up or obscurethe cervical cell sample. Cancel your Pap appointment if vaginal bleedingoccurs, because the presence of blood cells interferes with visual evaluation of the sample(Schuiling & Likis, 2006). 11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 207the nature of the surgery, risks, potential complications, changes in physical appearance and physiologic function,and sexuality alterations. Vulvar Cancer Vulvar cancer is an abnormal neoplastic growth on the external female genitalia (Fig. 8.5). It is responsible for0.6% of all malignancies in women and 4% of all femalegenital cancers. It is the fourth most common gynecologiccancer, after endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancers(Naumann & Higgins, 2007). The ACS estimates thatin 2007, about 4,000 cancers of the vulva will be diag-nosed in the United States and over 900 women will dieof this cancer (ACS, 2007e). When detected early, it ishighly curable. Vulvar cancer is found most commonly in older women in their mid-60s to 70s, but the incidence in208 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN women younger than 35 years old has increased over the past few decades. The overall 5-year survival rate whenlymph nodes are not involved is 90%, but it drops to 50%to 70% when the lymph nodes have been invaded (ACS,2007e). Pathophysiology Approximately 90% of vulvar tumors are squamous cellcarcinomas. This type of cancer forms slowly over severalyears and is usually preceded by precancerous changes.These precancerous changes are termed vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia (VIN). major types of VINare classic (undifferentiated) and simplex (differentiated).Classic VIN, the more common one, is associated withHPV infection (genital warts due to types 16, 18, 31, 33,35, and 51) and smoking (Wallace & Sanford, 2006). Ittypically occurs in women between 30 and 40 years old.In contrast to classic VIN, simplex VIN usually Urethral orifice Vulvar FIGURE 208Vulvar pruritus or a lump is present in the majority of women with vulvar cancer. Lumps should be biopsied even if the woman is asymptomatic.Take NOTE! postmenopausal women and is not associated with HPV(Davidson, 2007). Screening and Diagnosis Annual vulvar examination is the most effective way to pre-vent vu lvar cancer. Careful inspection of the vulva during routine annual gynecologic examinations remains the mostproductive diagnostic technique. Liberal use of biopsies ofany suspicious vulvar lesion is usually necessary to makethe diagnosis and to guide treatment. However, manywomen do not seek health care evaluation for months oryears after noticing an abnormal lump or lesion. The diagnosis of vulvar cancer is made by a biopsy of the suspicious lesion, which is usually found on thelabia majora. Therapeutic Management Treatment varies depending on the extent of the disease.Laser surgery, cryosurgery, or electrosurgical incision maybe used. Larger lesions may need more extensive surgeryand skin grafting. The traditional treatment for vulvarcancer has been radical vulvectomy, but more conserva-tive techniques are being used to improve psychosexualoutcomes. Nursing Assessment Typically, no single specic clinical symptom heralds thisdisease, so diagnosis is often delayed signicantly. There-fore, it is important to review the woman's history for riskfactors such as: Exposure to HPV type 16 Age over 50 HIV infection VIN Lichen sclerosus Melanoma or atypical moles Exposure to HSV II Multiple sex partners Smoking History of breast cancer Immune suppression Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Obesity (ACS, 2007e)CHAPTER 8 CANCERS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 209 In most cases, the woman reports persistent vulvar itching that does not improve with the use of creams or ointments. During the physical examination, observefor any masses or thickening of the vulvar area. A vulvarlump or mass most often is noted. The vulvar lesion isusually raised and may be fleshy, ulcerated, leukoplakic,or warty (Naumann & Higgins, 2007). Less commonly,the woman may present with vulvar bleeding, discharge,dysuria, and pain. Nursing Management Women with vulvar cancer must clearly understand their disease, treatment options, and prognosis. To accomplishthis, provide information and establish effective commu- nication with the client and her family. Act as an educatorand advocate. Teach the woman about healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking cessation and measures to reduce risk fac-tors. For example, instruct the woman how to examine hergenital area, urging her to do so monthly between men-strual periods. Tell her to look for any changes in appear-ance (e.g., whitened or reddened patches of skin); changesin feel (e.g., areas of the vulva becoming itchy or painful);or the development of lumps, moles (e.g., changes in size,shape, or color), freckles, cuts, or sores on the vulva. Urgethe woman to report these changes to the health careprovider ( ACS, 2007e). Teach the woman about preventive measures such as not wearing tight undergarments and not using per-fumes and dyes in the vulvar region. Also educate herabout the use of barrier methods of birth control (e.g.,condoms) to reduce the risk of contracting HIV, HSV,and HPV. For the woman diagnosed with vulvar cancer, pro- vide information and support. Discuss potential changesin sexuality if radical surgery is performed. Encourage herto communicate openly with her partner. Refer her to ap-propriate community resources and support groups. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Women have a one-in-three lifetime risk of develop- ing cancer, and one out of every four deaths is fromcancer; thus, nurses must focus on screening and edu-cating all women regardless of risk factors. /H18546The nurse plays a key role in offering emotional sup- port, determining appropriate sources of support, andhelping the woman use effective coping strategies whenfacing a diagnosis of cancer of the reproductive tract.Although reproductive tract cancer is rare during preg-nancy, the woman's vigilance and routine screeningsshould continue throughout. /H18546A woman's sexuality and culture are inextricably inter- woven, and it is essential that nurses working with11223-08_CH08.qxd 8/4/08 2:49 PM Page 209women of various cultures recognize this and remain sensitive to the vast changes that will take place when the diagnosis of cancer is made. /H18546Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer among women and the fourth most common cause ofcancer deaths for women in the United States, ac-counting for more deaths than any other cancer of thereproductive system. /H18546Ovarian cancer has been described as \"the overlooked disease\" or \"silent killer,\" because women and/or healthcare practitioners often ignore or rationalize early symp-toms. It is typically diagnosed in advanced stages. /H18546Unopposed endogenous and exogenous estrogens, obe- sity, nulliparity, menopause after age of 52 years,and diabetes are the major etiologic risk factors associ-ated with the development of endometrial cancer. /H18546The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that women should be informed about risks and symptomsof endometrial cancer at the onset of menopause andstrongly encouraged to report any unexpected bleedingor spotting to their health care providers. /H18546Malignant diseases of the vagina are either primary vagi- nal cancers or metastatic forms from adjacent or distantorgans. Vaginal cancer tumors can be effectively treatedand, when found early, are often curable. /H18546Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have de- creased noticeably in the past several decades, with mostof the reduction attributed to the Pap test, which detectscervical cancer and precancerous lesions. /H18546The nurse's role involves primary prevention of cer- vical cancer through education of women regardingrisk factors and preventive techniques to avoid cervi-cal dysplasia. /H18546Diagnosis of vulvar cancer is often delayed signicantly because there is no single specic clinical symptom thatheralds it.

For all the strides Americanwomen have made in the past 100 years, obliterating vio-lence against themselves isn't one of them. Violence againstwomen is a growing problem. In many countries it is stillaccepted as part of normal behavior. According to the Fed-eral Bureau of Investigation, one third to one half of allwomen in the United States will experience some form ofphysical violence during their lifetime (FBI, 2007). Fortypercent to 60 percent of murders of women in NorthAmerica are committed by intimate partners (FBI, 2007).Federal funding for the problem is trickling down to localprograms, but it isn't reaching victims fast enough. In theUnited States, there are three times more shelters for an- imals than for battered women (Dutton, 2007). In many cases, a victim escapes her abuser only to be turned away from a local shelter because it is full. The number of abusedwomen is stag gering: one woman is being battered every 12 seconds in the United States ( CDC, 2007a). Nurses play a major role in assessing women who have suffered some type of violence. Often, after a woman is victimized, she will complain about physical ailmentsthat will give her the opportunity to visit a health care set-ting. A visit to a health care agency is an ideal time forwomen to be assessed for violence. Because nurses areviewed as trustworthy and sensitive about very personalsubjects, women often feel comfortable in conding ordiscussing these issues with them.battering, and rape. Intimate partner violence affects a distressingly high percentage of the population and hasphysical, psychological, social, and economic conse-quences (Fig. 9.1). A nurse may be the rst health care professional to assess and identify the signs of intimate partner violenceand can have a profound impact on a woman's decisionto seek help. Thus, it is important for nurses to be ableto identify abuse and aid the victim. Intimate partnerviolence can leave signicant psychological scars, and a well-trained nurse can have a positive impact on the vic-tim's mental and emotional health. Incidence Although estimates vary, as many as 6 million womenare abused annually (CDC, 2007a). Even more shocking, 75% of the abused women initially identied in a medicalsetting go on to suffer repeated abuse, including homicide(CDC, 2007a). This may include physical violence, emo-tional abuse, sexual assault, rape, incest, or elder abuse.Each year, intimate partner violence results in an esti-mated 1,200 deaths and 2 million injuries among women(CDC, 2008). Women are at risk for violence at nearly every stage of their lives. Old, young, beautiful, unattractive, mar-ried, single\u2014no woman is completely safe from the riskof intimate partner violence. Current or former husbandsor lovers kill over half of the murdered women in theUnited States. Intimate partner violence against womencauses more serious injuries and deaths than automobileaccidents, rapes, and muggings combined. The medicalcost of intimate partner violence approaches $6 billioneach year to pay for medical and surgical care, counsel-ing, child care, incarceration, attorney fees, and loss ofwork productivity (Kelly, 2007). Abuse occurs in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships. Violence within gay and lesbian relation ships may go unreported for fear of harassment or ridicule. Inaddition, since gay and lesbian partnerships are not seenV FIGURE9.1Intimate partner violence has signi- cant physical, psychological, social, and eco-nomic consequences. An important role of thehealth care provider is to identify abusive or po-tentially abusive situations as soon as possibleand provide support for the victim. Nurses will come in contact with violence and sexual abuse no matter what health care setting they work in. Nurses must be ready to askthe right questions and to act on the answers, becausesuch action could be life-saving.Take NOTE! This chapter will address two types of violence against women: intimate partner violence and sexual abuse. Bothtypes of violence against women have devastating andcostly consequences for all of society. Intimate Partner Violence Intimate partner violence is actual or threatened phys- ical or sexual violence or psychological/emotional abuse.It includes threats of physical or sexual violence when thethreat is used to control a person's actions (CDC, 2007a).Intimate partners include individuals who are currently indating, cohabitating, or marital relationships, or thosewho have been in such relationships in the past. Some ofthe common terms used to describe intimate partner vio-lence are domestic abuse, spouse abuse, domestic violence,11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 215216 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN as legal in many states, there are few statistics gathered on incident rates. Background Until the mid-1970s, our society tended to legitimize aman's power and control over a woman. The U.S. legaland judicial systems considered intervention into familydisputes wrong and a violation of the family's right to pri-vacy. Intimate partner violence was often tolerated andeven socially acceptable. Fortunately, attitudes and lawshave changed to protect women and punish abusers. InHealthy People 2010, two key objectives address violence against women. Characteristics of Intimate Partner Violence Although more research is needed in this area, studies have found certain risk factors for intimate partner violence: Use and abuse of substances such as alcohol (this increases the risk of perpetration and victimization forboth men and women) Negative affect (e.g., hostility and depression) History of childhood abuse History of antisocial behavior Current unemployment Neighborhood norms that accept violence and drug use Traditional gender role expectations (Herrenkohl et al., 2007) Generation-to-Generation Continuum of Violence Violence is a learned behavior that, without interven- tion, is self-perpetuating. It is a cyclical health problem.The long-term effects of violence on victims and chil-dren can be profound. Children who witness one parentabuse another are more likely to become delinquents orbatterers themselves because they see abuse as an inte-gral part of a close relationship. Thus, an abusive rela-tionship between father and mother can perpetuate fu- ture abusive relationships. Research has found that chil-dren who witness intimate partner violence are at riskfor developing psychiatric disorders, developmentalproblems, school failure, violence against others, and lowself-esteem (Paluzzi, 2007). Childhood maltreatment is a major health problem that is associated with a wide range of physical conditionsand leads to high rates of psychiatric morbidity and socialproblems in adulthood. Women who were physically orsexually abused as children have an increased risk of vic-timization and experience adverse mental health condi-tions such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem asadults (Ferris, 2007). In 50% to 75% of the cases when a parent is abused, the children are abused as well (Paluzzi, 2007). Exposureto violence has a negative impact on children's physical,emotional, and cognitive well-being. The cycle contin-ues into another generation through learned responses and violent acting out. While there are always exceptions, mostchildren deprived of their basic physical, psychological, andspiritual needs do not develop healthy personalities. Theygrow up with feelings of fear, inadequacy, anxiety, anger,hostility, guilt, and rage. They often lack coping skills,blame others, demonstrate poor impulse control, and gen-erally struggle with authority. Unless this cycle is broken,more than half become abusers themselves (CDC, 2007a). The Cycle of Violence In an abusive relationship, the cycle of violence com- prises three distinct phases: the tension-building phase, theacute battering phase, and the honeymoon phase (Dutton,2007). The cyclical behavior begins with a time of tension-building arguments, progresses to violence, and settlesinto a making-up or calm period. This cycle of violence in- creases in frequency and severity as it is repeated over andover again. The cycle can cover a long or short period oftime. The honeymoon phase gradually shortens and even-tually disappears altogether. Abuse in relationships typi-cally becomes accelerated and thus more dangerous overtime. The abuser no longer feels the need to apologize andindulge in a honeymoon phase as the woman becomesincreasingly disempowered in the relationship. Phase 1: Tension-Building During the first\u2014and usually the longest\u2014phase of thecycle, tension escalates between the couple. Excessivedrinking, jealousy, or other factors might lead to name-calling, hostility, and friction. The woman might sense that her partner is reacting to her more negatively, that he is onedge and reacts heatedly to any trivial frustration. A womanoften will accept her partner's building anger as legitimatelydirected toward her. She internalizes what she perceives asher responsibility to keep the situation from exploding. Inher mind, if she does her job well, he remains calm. But ifshe fails, the resulting violence is her fault. 1. Reduce the rate of physi- cal assault by current orformer intimate partners. 2. Reduce the annual rate of rape or attemptedrape.Will increase women's quality and years of healthy life Eliminate health disparities for survivors of violence Goal is to have 90% compliance in screening for intimate partnerviolence by health professionals. Meeting these objectives will reflect the importance of earlydetection, intervention, andevaluation.

The batterer loses control both physically andemotionally. This is when the victim may be assaultedor murdered. After a battering episode, most victimsconsider themselves lucky that the abuse was notworse, no matter how severe their injuries. They oftendeny the seriousness of their injuries and refuse to seekmedical treatment. Phase 3: Honeymoon The third phase of the cycle is a period of calm, loving,contrite behavior on the part of the batterer. He may begenuinely sorry for the pain he caused his partner. Heattempts to make up for his brutal behavior and believeshe can control himself and never hurt the woman he loves. The victim wants to believe that her partner really canchange. She feels responsible, at least in part, for causingthe incident, and she feels responsible for her partner'swell-being (Box 9.1). Types of Abuse Abusers may use whatever it takes to control a situation\u2014 from emotional abuse and humiliation to physical assault. Victims often tolerate emotional, physical, nancial, andsexual abuse. Many remain in abusive relationships be-cause they believe they deserve the abuse. Emotional Abuse Emotional abuse includes: Promising, swearing, or threatening to hit the victim Forcing the victim to perform degrading or humiliat- ing acts Threatening to harm children, pets, or close friends Humiliating the woman by name-calling and insults Threatening to leave her and the children Destroying valued possessions Controlling the victim's every movePhysical Abuse Physical abuse includes: Hitting or grabbing the victim so hard that it leaves marks Throwing things at the victim Slapping, spitting at, biting, burning, pushing, choking, or shoving the victim Kicking or punching the victim, or slamming her against things Attacking the victim with a knife, gun, rope, or electrical cord Controlling access to health care for injury Financial Abuse Financial abuse includes: Preventing the woman from getting a job Sabotaging a current job Controlling how all money is spent Failing to contribute nancially Sexual Abuse Sexual abuse includes: Forcing the woman to have vaginal, oral, or anal inter- course against her will Biting the victim's breasts or genitals Shoving objects into the victim's vagina Forcing the victim to perform sexual acts on other people or animals Myths and Facts About Intimate Partner Violence There are many myths about intimate partner violence (Table 9.1). Health care providers should take steps todispel these myths. Abuse Proles Victims Ironically, victims rarely describe themselves as abused.In battered woman syndrome , the woman has experi- enced deliberate and repeated physical or sexual assaultby an intimate partner. She is terried and feels trapped,helpless, and alone. She reacts to any expression of angeror threat by avoidance and withdrawal behavior. Some women believe that the abuse is caused by a personality flaw or inadequacy in themselves (e.g., inabil-ity to keep the man happy). These feelings of failure arereinforced and exploited by their partners. After beingtold repeatedly that they are \"bad,\" some women beginto believe it. Many victims were abused as children andmay have poor self-esteem, depression, insomnia, or ahistory of suicide attempts, injury, or drug and alcoholabuse (Aggeles, 2007). Abusers Abusers come from all walks of life and often feel insecure,powerless, and helpless, feelings that are not in line withthe macho image they would like to project. The abuserBOX 9.1 Cycle of Violence Phase 1: Tension-building: Verbal or minor battery occurs. Almost any subject, such as housekeeping ormoney, may trigger the buildup of tension. The victimattempts to calm the abuser. Phase 2: Acute battering: Characterized by uncontrol- lable discharge of tension. Violence is rarely triggeredby the victim's behavior: she is battered no matterwhat her response. Phase 3: Reconciliation (honeymoon)/calm phase: The batterer becomes loving, kind, and apologetic andexpresses guilt. Then the abuser works on making thevictim UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Frequently the fear of harm to her unborn child will motivate a woman to escape an abusive relationship.Take NOTE! expresses his feelings of inadequacy through violence or aggression toward others (Du Plat-Jones, 2006). Violence typically occurs at home and is usually directed toward the man's intimate partner or the childrenwho live there. Abusers refuse to share power and chooseviolence to control their victims. They often exhibit child-like aggression or antisocial behaviors. They may fail to ac-cept responsibility or blame others for their own problems.They might also have a history of substance abuse prob-lems, mental illness, arrests, troubled relationships, obses-sive jealousy, controlling behaviors, erratic employmenthistory, and nancial problems. Violence Against Pregnant Women Many think of pregnancy as a time of celebration and planning for the unborn child's future, but in a troubledrelationship it can be a time of escalating violence. Thestrongest predictor of abuse during pregnancy is priorabuse (Giardino, 2007). For women who have beenabused before, beatings and violence during pregnancyare \"business as usual\" for them. Women are at a higher risk for violence during preg- nancy. Pregnant women are vulnerable during this time,and abusers can take advantage of it. An estimated325,000 pregnant women are abused by their partnerseach year (CDC, 2007a). Abuse during pregnancy posesspecial risks and dynamics. Various factors may lead to battering during preg- nancy, including: Inability of the couple to cope with the stressors of pregnancy Resentment toward the interference of the growing fetus and change in the woman's shape Doubts about paternity or the expectant mother's delity during pregnancy Perception that the baby will be a competitor Outside attention the pregnancy brings to the woman Unwanted pregnancy The woman's new interest in herself and her unborn baby Insecurity and jealousy about the pregnancy and the responsibilities it brings Financial burden related to expense of pregnancy and loss of income Stress of role transition from adult man to becoming the father of a child Physical and emotional changes of pregnancy that make the woman vulnerable Previous isolation from family and friends that limit the couple's support system Abuse during pregnancy threatens the well-being of the mother and fetus. Physical violence may involve injuriesto the head, face, neck, thorax, breasts, and abdomen(Casanueva & Martin, 2007). The mental health con-sequences are also significant. Several studies have con-rmed the relationship between abuse and poor mentalhealth, especially depression (Giardino, 2007). For thepregnant woman, this most often manifests itself as post-partum depression.Battering of women occurs only in lower socioeconomic classes. Substance abuse causes the violence.Violence occurs to only a small percentage of women.Women can easily choose to leave the abusive relationship.Only men with mental health problems commit violence against women. Pregnant women are protected from abuse by their partners. Women provoke their partners to abuse them.Violent tendencies have gone on for generations and are accepted.Myths FactsTABLE 9.1 all socioeconomic classes.Violence is a learned behavior and can be changed. The presence of drugs and alcohol can make a badproblem worse. One in four women will be victims of violence.Women stay in the abusive relationship because they feel they have no options. Abusers often seem normal and don't appear to suffer from personality disorders or other forms of mental illness. One in ve women is physically abused during pregnancy. The effects of violence on infant outcomes can includepreterm delivery, fetal distress, low birthweight, andchild abuse. Women may be willing to blame themselves for someone else's bad behavior, but nobody deserves to be beaten. The police, justice system, and society are beginning to make domestic violence socially unacceptable.11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 218CHAPTER 9 VIOLENCE AND ABUSE 219 Women assaulted during pregnancy are at risk for: Injuries to themselves and the fetus Depression Chronic anxiety Miscarriage Stillbirth Poor nutrition Insomnia Placental abruption Uterine rupture Excessive weight gain or loss Smoking and substance abuse Delayed or no prenatal care Preterm labor Chorioamnionitis Vaginitis Sexually transmitted infections Urinary tract infections Premature and low-birthweight infants (Sharps, Laughon, & Giangrande, 2007) Signs of abuse can emerge during pregnancy and may include poor attendance at prenatal visits, unrealistic fears,weight fluctuations, difficulty with pelvic examinations,and noncompliance with treatment.Uncovering abuse in pregnant women requires a consistent and direct approach to every client by thenurse. Multiple assessments may enhance reporting byenabling the nurse to establish trust and rapport withthe woman and identify changes in her behavior. Onceabuse is discovered in a pregnant woman, interventionsshould include safety assessment, emotional support,counseling, referral to community services, and ongoingprenatal care (Burgess, 2007). Violence Against Older Women Intimate partner violence affects women of all ages, butoften the literature focuses on women in the childbearingyears, ignoring the problems of aging women experiencingabuse. There are laws in all 50 states requiring health careprofessionals to report elder or vulnerable person abuse.Estimates suggest that 500,000 to 1.5 million cases of elderabuse and neglect occur annually in the United States(Bonomi et al., 2007). Although an injury may bring the older woman into the health care system, the physical and emotional se-quelae of intimate partner violence may be more subtle:they may include depression, insomnia, chronic pain,atypical chest pain, or other kinds of somatic symptoms(Thackeray et al., 2007). Accurate detection and assess- The goal of this randomized controlled trial was to deter- mine whether individualized nursing case management candecrease stress among pregnant women at risk for abuseor in abusive relationships. Study The study was conducted at two prenatal clinics in the Pacific Northwest and rural Midwest. Participantswere 1,000 women who spoke English and were 13 to 23 weeks pregnant at time of recruitment. All interventiongroup women (n =499) were offered an abuse video and had access to a nurse case manager 24/7. Participants at risk for abuse or in abusive relationships also receivedindividualized nursing care management throughout thepregnancy. Findings The most common nursing activities were providing sup-port (38%) and assessing needs (32%). The nursing caremanagement group received an average of 22 contacts,most (80%) by telephone, and had a significant reduction in stress scores as measured by the Prenatal Psycho-social Profile. Compared to the control group, the differ-ences were in the predicted direction but were notstatistically different. A major finding was the choice by abused women to focus on basic needs and theirpregnancies rather than the abuse, although all receivedsafety planning. Nursing Implications Pregnant women at risk for abuse or in abusive relation-ships experience very stressful and complex lives. Nursesneed to focus on the needs they identify, which may not bethe abusive relationship. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 9.1 Nurse Case Management for Pregnant Women Experiencing or at Risk for Abuse Curry, M. A., Durham, L., Bullock, L., Bloom, T., & Davis, J. (2006). Nurse case management for pregnant women experiencing or at risk for abuse. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing, 35 (2), 181-192.11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 219220 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN ment of abuse in elderly women are essential duties of all nurses. Nursing Management Nurses encounter thousands of abuse victims each year in their practice settings, but many victims slip through thecracks. There are many things that nurses can do to helpvictims. Early recognition and intervention can signi-cantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated withintimate partner violence. To stop the cycle of violence,nurses need to know how to assess for and identify vio-lence and implement appropriate actions. The key isastute assessment and identication. Assessment Routine screening for intimate partner violence is the rstway to detect abuse. The nurse should build rapport byshowing an interest in the concerns of the woman, listen-ing, and creating an atmosphere of openness. Communi-cating support through a nonjudgmental attitude, or tellingher that no one deserves to be abused, is the rst step to-ward establishing trust and rapport. Rather than overlook-ing abused women as \"chronic complainers,\" astute nursesneed to be vigilant for subtle clues of abuse. Learning how to assess for abuse is critical. Some basic assessment guidelines follow. Screen for Abuse During Every Health Care Visit Screening for violence takes only a few minutes and canhave an enormously positive effect on the outcome for theabused woman. Any woman could be a victim; no singlesign marks a woman as an abuse victim, but the followingclues may be helpful: Injuries: bruises, scars from blunt trauma, or weapon wounds on the face, head, and neck Injury sequelae: headaches, hearing loss, joint pain, sinus infections, teeth marks, clumps of hair missing,dental trauma, pelvic pain, breast or genital injuries Reported history of injury that is not consistent with the actual presenting problem Mental health problems: depression, anxiety, sub- stance abuse, eating disorders, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts Frequent health care visits for chronic, stress-related disorders such as chest pain, headaches, back or pelvicpain, insomnia, and gastrointestinal disturbances Partner's behavior at the health care visit: appears overly solicitous or overprotective, is unwilling to leaveher alone with the health care provider, answers ques-tions for her, and attempts to control the situation(Aggeles, 2007) Look for the following indicators of abuse: Previous history of assault Previous injuries inflicted by weapons Multiple medical visits for injuries or anxiety symptoms History of depression, substance use, or suicide attempts Tranquilizer or sedative use Sexually transmitted infections or pelvic inflammatory disease Bruises to the upper arm, neck and face, abdomen, or breasts Comments about emotional or physical abuse of \"a friend\" Hovering behavior of male partner during visit (Aggeles, 2007; Giardino, 2007) Dorothy, who you met at the beginning of the chapter, has been frequenting the clinic with vague somatic complaints inrecent weeks and admits she is sometimes afraid at home.She tells the nurse her partner doesn't want her to work,even though he was only sporadically employed at low-paying jobs. What cues in her assessment might indicateabuse? What physical signs might the nurse observe? Isolate Patient Immediately From Family If abuse is detected, immediately isolate the woman toprovide privacy and to prevent potential retaliation fromthe abuser. Asking about abuse in front of the perpetra-tor may trigger an abusive episode during the interviewor at home. Ways to ensure the woman's safety would beto take the victim to an area away from the abuser to askquestions. The assessment can take place anywhere\u2014x-ray area, ultrasound room, elevator, ladies' room,laboratory\u2014that is private and away from the abuser. If abuse is detected, the nurse can do the following to enhance the nurse-client relationship: Educate the woman about the connection between the violence and her symptoms. Help the woman acknowledge what has happened to her and begin to deal with the situation. Offer her referrals so she can get the help that will allow her to begin to heal. Dorothy returns to the prenatal clinic a month later with anemia, inadequate weight gain, bruises on her face andneck, and second-trimester bleeding. This time she isaccompanied by her partner, who stays close to Dorothy.What questions should the nurse ask to assess the situation?Where is the appropriate location to ask these questions?What legal responsibilities does the nurse have concerningher observations? Ask Direct or Indirect Questions About Abuse Questions to screen for abuse should be routine and han-dled just like any other question. Many nurses feel uncom-fortable asking questions of this nature, but broaching thesubject is important even if the answer comes later. Just11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 220CHAPTER 9 VIOLENCE AND ABUSE 221 knowing that someone else knows about the abuse offers a victim some relief. Ask difcult questions in an empathetic and nonthreat- ening manner and remain nonjudgmental in all responsesand interactions. Choose the type of question that makesyou most comfortable. Direct and indirect questions pro-duce the same results. \"Does your partner hit you?\" or\"Have you ever been or are you now in an abusive relation-ship?\" are direct questions. If that approach feels uncom-fortable, try indirect questions: \"We see many womenwith injuries or complaints like yours and often they are being abused. Is that what is happening to you?\" or \"Manywomen in our community experience abuse from theirpartners. Is anything like that happening in your life?\" Witheither approach, nurses need to maintain a nonjudgmentalacceptance of whatever answer the woman offers. The SAVE Model is a screening protocol that nurses can use when assessing women for violence (Box 9.2).Assess Immediate Safety The Danger Assessment Tool helps women and healthcare providers assess the potential for homicidal behaviorin an ongoing abusive relationship. It is based on researchthat showed several risk factors for abuse-related murders: Increased frequency or severity of abuse Presence of rearms Sexual abuse Substance abuse Generally violent behavior outside of the home Control issues (e.g., daily chores, friends, job, money) Physical abuse during pregnancy Suicide threats or attempts (victim or abuser) Child abuse (Kelly, 2007) Document and Report Your Findings If the interview reveals a history of abuse, accurate docu-mentation is critical because this evidence may supportthe woman's case in court. Documentation must includedetails about the frequency and severity of abuse; thelocation, extent, and outcome of injuries; and any treat-ments or interventions. When documenting, use directquotes and be very specic: \"He choked me.\" Describeany visible injuries, and use a body map (outline of awoman's body) to show where the injuries are. Obtainphotos (with informed consent) or document her refusalif the woman declines photos. Pictures or diagrams can beworth a thousand words. Figure 9.2 shows a sample doc-umentation form for intimate partner violence. Laws in many states require health care providers to alert the police to any injuries that involve knives, rearms,or other deadly weapons or that present life-threateningemergencies. If assessment reveals suspicion or actual in-dication of abuse, you can explain to the woman that youare required by law to report it. Nursing Diagnosis When violence is suspected or validated, the nurse needsto formulate nursing diagnoses based on the completedassessment. Possible nursing diagnoses related to violenceagainst women might include the following: Decient knowledge related to understanding the cycle of violence and availability of resources Fear related to possibility of severe injury to self or children during cycle of violence Low self-esteem related to feelings of worthlessness Hopelessness related to prolonged exposure to violence Compromised individual and family coping related to persistence of victim-abuser relationship Interventions If abuse is identied, nurses can undertake interventionsthat can increase the woman's safety and improve herhealth. The goal of intervention is to enable the victim togain control of her life. Provide sensitive, predictable careBOX 9.2 SAVE Model SCREEN all of your patients for violence by asking: Do you feel safe in your home? Do you feel you are in control of your life? Have you ever been sexually or physically abused? Can you talk about your abuse with me now? ASK direct questions in a nonjudgmental way: Begin by normalizing the topic to the woman. Make continuous eye contact with the woman. Stay calm; avoid emotional reactions to what she tells you. Never blame the woman, even if she blames herself. Don't dismiss or minimize what she tells you, even if she does. Wait for each answer patiently. Don't rush to the next question. Do not use formal, technical, or medical language. Use a nonthreatening, accepting approach. VALIDATE the patient by telling her: You believe her story. You do not blame her for what happened. It is brave of her to tell you this. Help is available for her. Talking with you is a hopeful sign and a rst big step. EVALUATE, educate, and refer this patient byasking her: What type of violence was it? Is she now in any danger? How is she feeling now? Does she know that there are consequences to violence? Is she aware of community resources available to help her?

Provide educational materials about vio-lence. Allow the victim to actively participate in her careand have control over all health care decisions. Pace yournursing interventions and allow the woman to take thelead. Communicate support through a nonjudgmentalattitude. Carefully document assessment ndings andnursing interventions. Depending on when in the cycle of violence the nurse encounters the abused woman, goals may fall into threegroups: Primary prevention: aimed at breaking the abuse cycle through community educational initiatives by nurses,physicians, law enforcement, teachers, and clergy Secondary prevention: focuses on dealing with victims and abusers in early stages, with the goal of preventingprogression of abuse Tertiary prevention: activities are geared toward help- ing severely abused women and children recover andbecome productive members of society and rehabili-tating abusers to stop the cycle of violence. These activities are typically long term and expensive. A tool developed by Holtz and Furniss (1993)\u2014the ABCDES\u2014provides a framework for providing sensitivenursing interventions to abused women (Box 9.3). Specic nursing interventions for the abused woman include educating her about community services, provid-ing emotional support, and offering a safety plan.Educate the Woman About Community Services A wide range of support services are available to meet theneeds of victims of violence. Nurses should be preparedto help the woman take advantage of these opportunities.Services will vary by community but might include psy-chological counseling, legal advice, social services, crisisservices, support groups, hotlines, housing, vocationaltraining, and other community-based referrals. Give the woman information about shelters or services even if she initially rejects it. Give the woman the NationalDomestic Violence hotline number: (800) 799-7233. Since1992, guidelines from the Joint Commission on Accredita-tion of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) have requiredemergency departments to maintain lists of communityreferral agencies that deal with the victims of intimate part-ner violence (JCAHO, 2007). Provide Emotional Support Providing reassurance and support to a victim of abuse iskey if the violence is to end. Nurses in all clinical settingscan help victims to feel a sense of personal power and pro-vide them with a safe and supportive environment. Appro-priate action can help victims to express their thoughts andfeelings in constructive ways, manage stress, and move onwith their lives. Appropriate interventions are: Strengthen the woman's sense of control over her life by: Teaching coping strategies to manage her stress Assisting with activities of daily living to improve her lifestyle Allowing her to make as many decisions as she can Educating her about the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and their basis Encourage the woman to establish realistic goals for herself by: Teaching problem-solving skills Encouraging social activities to connect with other people Provide support and allow the woman to grieve for her losses by: Listening to and clarifying her reactions to the trau- matic event Discussing shock, disbelief, anger, depression, and acceptance Explain to the woman that: Abuse is never OK. She didn't ask for it and she doesn't deserve it. She is not alone and help is available. Abuse is a crime and she is a victim. Alcohol, drugs, money problems, depression, or jeal- ousy does not cause violence, but these things cangive the abuser an excuse for losing control andabusing her. The actions of the abuser are not her fault. Her history of abuse is believed. Making a decision to leave an abusive relationship can be very hard and takes time. BOX 9.3 The ABCDES of Caring for Abused Women Ais reassuring the woman that she is not alone. The isolation by her abuser keeps her from knowing thatothers are in the same situation and that health careproviders can help her. Bis expressing the belief that violence against women is not acceptable in any situation and that it is not herfault.

A clear quoted statement about the abuse2. Accurate descriptions of injuries and the history of them 3. Photos of the injuries (with the woman's consent) Eis education about the cycle of violence and that it will escalate. Sis safety, the most important aspect of the interven- tion, to ensure that the woman has resources and aplan of action to carry out when she decides to leave.11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 224CHAPTER 9 VIOLENCE AND ABUSE 225 Offer a Safety Plan The choice to leave must rest with the victim. Nurses can-not choose a life for the victim; they can only offer choices.Leaving is a process, not an event. Victims may try to leavetheir abusers as many as seven or eight times before suc-ceeding. Frequently, the nal attempt to leave may resultin the death of the victim. Women planning to leave anabusive relationship should have a safety plan, if possible(Teaching Guidelines 9.1). Sexual Violence Sexual violence is both a public health problem and ahuman rights violation. More than once every 3 minutes,78 times an hour, 1,871 times a day, girls and women inAmerica are raped (Medicine Net, 2007). Rape has beenreported against females from age 6 months to 93 years, butit still remains one of the most underreported violent crimesin the United States. Estimates suggest that, somewherein the United States, a woman is sexually assaulted every2.5 minutes (RAINN, 2007). The National Center for Pre-vention and Control of Sexual Assault estimates that oneout of three women will be sexually assaulted sometime inher life, and two thirds of these assaults will not be reported(CDC, 2007b). Over the course of their lives, women mayexperience more than one type of violence. Sexual violence can have a variety of devastating short- and long-term effects. Women can experience psycholog-ical, physical, and cognitive symptoms that affect themdaily. They can include chronic pelvic pain, headaches, backache, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy,anxiety, denial, fear, withdrawal, sleep disturbances,guilt, nervousness, phobias, substance abuse, depres-sion, sexual dysfunction, and post-traumatic stress dis-order (CDC, 2007b). A traumatic experience not onlydamages a woman's sense of safety in the world, but itcan also reduce her self-esteem and her ability to con-tinue her education, to earn money and be productive,to have children and, if she has children, to nurture andprotect them (Macy et al., 2007). TEACHING GUIDELINES 9.1 Safety Plan for Leaving an Abusive Relationship When leaving an abusive relationship, take the following items: Driver's license or photo ID Social security number or green card/work permit Birth certicates for you and your children Phone numbers for social services or women'sshelter The deed or lease to your home or apartment Any court papers or orders A change of clothing for you and your children Pay stubs, checkbook, credit cards, and cash Insurance cards (Du Plat-Jones, 2006; Dutton,2007) If you need to leave a domestic violence situationimmediately, turn to authorities for assistance ingathering this material. Develop a \"game plan\" for leaving and rehearse it. Don't use phone cards\u2014they leave a trail to follow. Sexual violence has been called a \"tragedy of youth.\" More than half of all rapes (54%) of women occur before age 18 (Medicine Net, 2007).Take NOTE! Assailants, like their victims, come from all walks of life and all ethnic backgrounds; there is no typical prole.More than half are under 25, and the majority are mar-ried and leading \"normal\" sex lives. Why do men rape?No theory provides a satisfactory explanation. So few as-sailants are caught and convicted that a clear prole re-mains elusive. What is known is that many assailants havetrouble dealing with the stresses of daily life. Such menbecome angry and experience feelings of powerlessness.They commit a sexual assault as an expression of powerand control (Macy et al., 2007). Sexual violence is a broad term that can be used to describe sexual abuse, incest, rape, female genital muti-lation, and human trafcking. Sexual Abuse Sexual abuse occurs when a woman is forced to have sex- ual contact of any kind (vaginal, oral, or anal) without herconsent. Marriage does not constitute a tacit agreement fora spouse to inflict one's demands on the other without per-mission. Childhood sexual abuse is any type of sexual ex-ploitation that involves a child younger than 18 years old;it might include disrobing, nudity, masturbation, fondling,digital penetration, and intercourse (Alekseeva, 2007). Childhood sexual abuse has a lifelong impact on its survivors. Women who were sexually abused during child-hood are at a heightened risk for repeat abuse. This isbecause the early abuse lowers their self-esteem and theirability to protect themselves and set firm boundaries.Childhood sexual abuse is a trauma that influences the wayvictims form relationships, deal with adversity, cope withdaily problems, relate to their children and peers, protecttheir health, and live. Studies have shown that the morevictimization a woman experiences, the more likely it is shewill be re-victimized (Kristensen & Lau, 2007).11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 225226 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Incest Childhood sexual abuse involves any kind of sexual experi- ence between a child and another person that violates thesocial taboos of family roles; children cannot yet under-stand these activities and cannot give informed consent(Alekseeva, 2007). Incest is any type of sexual exploitation between blood relatives or surrogate relatives before the vic-tim reaches 18 years of age. Such sexual abuse is not onlya crime but also a symptom of acute and irreversible fam-ily dysfunction. Survivors of incest are often tricked, co-erced, or manipulated. All adults appear to be powerful tochildren. Perpetrators might threaten victims so that theyare afraid to disclose the abuse or might tell them the abuseis their fault. Often these threats serve to silence victims. Incestual relationships in the home endanger not only the child's intellectual and moral development, but also thehealth of the child. Many children don't ask for help be-cause they don't want to expose their \"secret.\" For this rea-son, just the tip of the iceberg is statistically visible\u2014seriousinjuries, internal damage, sexually transmitted infections,or pregnancy. Incest can have serious long-term effects onits victims, which may include eating disorders, sexualproblems in their adult life, post-traumatic stress disorder,intense guilt and shame, low self-esteem, depression, andself-destructive behavior (NCVC, 2007). Whether an incest victim endured an isolated inci- dent of abuse or ongoing assaults over an extended pe-riod, recovery can be painful and difcult. The recoveryprocess begins with admission of abuse and the recogni-tion that help and services are needed. Resources for in- cest victims include books, self-help groups, workshops,therapy programs, and possibly legal remedies. In addi-tion to listening to and believing incest victims, nursesneed to search for ways to prevent future generationsfrom enduring such abuse and from continuing the cycleof abuse in their own family and relationships.Despite different perceptions as to what constitutes child sexual abuse, there is a consensus among clini-cians and researchers that this is a substantial socialproblem that affects large numbers of children andyoung people worldwide. The effects of sexual abusemanifest themselves in a wide range of symptoms, including fear, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorderand behavior problems such as externalizing or internal-izing, or inappropriate sexual behaviors. Child sexualabuse is associated with an increased risk of psychologi-cal problems in adulthood. Knowing what is most likelyto benefit children already traumatized by these events is important. Study The aim of this review was to assess the efcacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in addressing the immediate and longer-term sequelae of sexual abuse in children. Ten studies comprising 847 children were identi-ed that met the inclusion criteria. Findings The evidence suggests that CBT may have a positive impact on the sequelae of child sexual abuse, but most results were statistically nonsignicant. Nursing Implications The review confirms CBT's potential for addressing the adverse consequences of child sexual abuse buthighlights the tenuousness of the evidence base and the need for more carefully conducted and better reported trials. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 9.2 Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions for Children Who Have Been Sexually Abused Macdonald, G. M., Higgins, J. P. T., & Ramchandani, P. (2006). Cognitive-behavioral interventions for children who have been sexually abused. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD001930. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001930.pub2. Consider THIS! At 53 years old, I stood and looked at myself in the mirror. The image staring back at me was one of afrightened, middle-aged, cowardly woman hiding herpast. I had been sexually abused by my father for manyyears as a child and never told anyone. My motherknew of the abuse but felt helpless to make it stop. I married right out of high school to escape and felt I lived a \"happy normal life\" with my husband andthree children. My children have left home and liveaway, and my husband recently died of a sudden heartattack. I am now experiencing dreams and thoughtsabout my past abuse and feeling afraid again. Thoughts: This woman suppressed her abusive past for most of her life and now her painful experience hassurfaced. What can be done to reach out to her at thispoint? Did her health care providers miss the \"redflags\" that are common to women with a history ofchildhood sexual abuse all those years? 11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 226CHAPTER 9 VIOLENCE AND ABUSE 227 Rape Rape is an expression of violence, not a sexual act. It is not an act of lust or an overzealous release of passion: it is aviolent, aggressive assault on the victim's body and in-tegrity. Rape is a legal rather than a medical term. It de-notes penile penetration of the vagina, mouth, or rectum ofthe female or male without consent. It may or may not in-clude the use of a weapon. Statutory rape is sexual activ- ity between an adult and a person under the age of 18 andis considered to have occurred even if the underage personwas willing (Kandakai & Smith, 2007). Nine out of every10 rape victims are female (Alexander et al., 2007). En-forcement of laws, education, and community empower-ment are all needed to prevent rape. Many people believe that rape usually occurs on a dark night when a stranger assaults a provocativelydressed, promiscuous woman. They believe that rapistsare sex-starved people seeking sexual gratication. Suchmyths and the facts are presented in Table 9.2. Acquaintance Rape In acquaintance rape , someone is forced to have sex by a person he or she knows. Rape by a coworker, a teacher,a husband's friend, or a boss is considered acquaintancerape. Date rape , an assault that occurs within a dating re- lationship or marriage without consent of one of the par-ticipants, is a form of acquaintance rape. Acquaintance and date rapes commonly occur on college campuses.One in four college women has been raped\u2014that is, hasbeen forced, physically or verbally, actively or implicitly,to engage in sexual activity (Elliott, 2008). These forms of rape are physically and emotionally devastating for the victims. Research has indicated thatthe survivors of acquaintance rape report similar levels ofdepression, anxiety, complications in subsequent rela-tionships, and difculty attaining pre-rape levels of sex-ual satisfaction to what survivors of stranger rape report.Acquaintance rape remains a controversial topic becausethere is lack of agreement on the denition of consent(Sampson, 2007). Although acquaintance rape and date rape do not al- ways involve drugs, a rapist might use alcohol or otherdrugs to sedate his victim. In 1996 the federal governmentpassed a law making it a felony to give an unsuspectingperson a \"date rape drug\" with the intent of raping him orher. Even with penalties of large fines and up to 20 yearsin prison, the use of date rape drugs is growing (U.S.DHHS, 2007). Date rape drugs are also known as \"club drugs\" be- cause they are often used at dance clubs, fraternity par-ties, and all-night raves. The most common is Rohypnol(also known as roofies, forget pills, and the drop drug).It comes in the form of a liquid or pill that quickly dis-solves in liquid with no odor, taste, or color. This drug is10 times as strong as diazepam (Valium) and producesmemory loss for up to 8 hours. Gamma hydroxybutyrate(GHB; called liquid ecstasy or easy lay) produces eupho-ria, an out-of-body high, sleepiness, increased sex drive,and memory loss. It comes in a white powder or liquidand may cause unconsciousness, depression, and coma. Childhood sexual abuse is a trauma that can affect every aspect of the victim's life.Take NOTE! Women who are raped get over it quickly. Most rape victims tell someone about it.Once the rape is over, a survivor can again feel safe in her life. If a woman does not want to be raped, it cannot happen.Women who feel guilty after having sex then say they were raped. Victims should report the violence to the police and judicial system. Women blame themselves for the rape, believing they did something to provoke the rape. Women who wear tight, short clothes are \"asking for it.\"Women have rape fantasies and want to be raped.Medication can help women forget about the rape.Myths FactsTABLE 9.2 COMMON MYTHS AND FACTSABOUTRAPE Sources: CDC, 2007b; Dutton, 2007; Medicine Net, 2007.It can take several years to recover emotionally and physically from rape. The majority of women never tell anyone about it. In fact, almost two thirds of victims never report it to the police. The victim feels vulnerable, betrayed, and insecure afterwards. A woman can be forced and overpowered by most men.Few women falsely cry \"rape.\" It is very traumatizing to be a victim. Only 1% of rapists are arrested and convicted.Women should never blame themselves for being the victim of someone else's violence. No victim invites sexual assault, and what she wears is irrelevant. Reality and fantasy are different.Dreams have nothing to do with the brutal violation of rape.Initially medication can help, but counseling is needed.11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 227228 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN The third date rape drug, ketamine (known as Special K, vitamin K, or super acid), acts on the central nervoussystem to separate perception and sensation. Combining ketamine with other drugs can be fatal. Date rape drugs can be very dangerous, and there are a variety of ways that women can protect themselves(Teaching Guidelines 9.2). Rape Recovery Rape survivors take a long time to heal from their trau-matic experience. Some women never heal and neverget professional counseling, but most can cope. Rape is viewed as a situational crisis that the survivor is unpreparedto handle because it is an unforeseen event. Survivors typ-ically go through four phases of recovery following rape (Table 9.3). A signicant proportion of women who are raped also experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress dis- order (PTSD). PTSD develops when an event outside the range of normal human experience occurs that pro-duces marked distress in the person. Symptoms of PTSDare divided into three groups: Intrusion (re-experiencing the trauma, including nightmares, flashbacks, recurrent thoughts) Avoidance (avoiding trauma-related stimuli, social withdrawal, emotional numbing) Hyperarousal (increased emotional arousal, exagger- ated startle response, irritability)TEACHING GUIDELINES 9.2 Protecting Yourself Against Date Rape Drugs Avoid parties where alcohol is being served. Never leave a drink of any kind unattended. Don't accept a drink from someone else. Accept drinks from a bartender or in a closed container only. Don't drink from a punch bowl or a keg. If you think someone drugged you, call 911. Take NOTE! Many rape survivors seek treatment in the hospital emergency room if there are no rape crisis centers available. Unfortunately, manyemergency room doctors and nurses have little trainingin how to treat rape survivors or in collecting evidence.To make matters worse, if they have to wait for hoursin public waiting rooms, survivors may leave the hos-pital, never to receive treatment or supply the evidenceneeded to arrest and convict their assailants. Acute phase (disorganization) Outward adjustment phase (denial)ReorganizationIntegration and recoveryPhase Survivor's ResponseTABLE 9.3 FOURPHASES OF RAPERECOVERY Shock, fear, disbelief, anger, shame, guilt, feelings of uncleanliness; insomnia, nightmares, and sobbing Appears outwardly composed and returns to work or school; refuses to discuss the assault and denies need for counseling Denial and suppression don't work, and the survivor attempts to make life adjust- ments by moving or changing jobs and uses emotional distancing to cope. Survivor begins to feel safe and starts to trust others. She may become an advocate for other rape victims.Providing Supporting Care Establishing a therapeutic and trusting relationship willhelp the survivor describe her experience. Take the womanto a secure, isolated area away from family, friends, andother patients and staff so she can be open and honestwhen asked about the assault. Provide a change of clothes,access to a shower and toiletries, and a private waiting areafor family and friends. Collecting and Documenting Evidence The victim should be instructed to bring all clothing,especially undergarments, worn at the time of the assaultto the medical facility. The victim should not shower orbathe before presenting for care. Typically a speciallytrained nurse will collect the evidence from the victim.Nursing Management Research has found that rape survivors undergo a pro-found and complex trauma. The survivor should be pro-vided with a safe and comfortable environment for aforensic examination. Nursing care of the rape survivorshould focus on providing supporting care, collecting anddocumenting evidence, assessing for sexually transmittedinfections, preventing pregnancy, and assessing for PTSD.Once initial treatment and evidence collection are com-pleted, follow-up care should include counseling, medicaltreatment, and crisis intervention. There is mounting evi-dence that early intervention and immediate counselingspeed a rape survivor's recovery. Nursing Care Plan 9.1highlights a sample plan of care for a victim of rape.11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 228CHAPTER 9 VIOLENCE AND ABUSE 229 Assessing for Sexually Transmitted Infections As part of the assessment, a pelvic examination will bedone to collect vaginal secretions to rule out any sexuallytransmitted infections. This examination is very emotion-ally stressful for most women and should be carried outvery gently and sensitively. Preventing Pregnancy An essential element in the care of rape survivors involvesoffering them pregnancy prevention. After unprotectedintercourse, including rape, pregnancy can be prevented byusing emergency contraceptive pills, sometimes calledpostcoital contraception. Emergency contraceptive pillsinvolve high doses of the same oral contraceptives that mil-lions of women take every day. The emergency regimenconsists of two doses: the rst dose is taken within 72 hoursof the unprotected intercourse and the second dose is taken12 hours after the rst dose or sooner. Emergency contra- ception works by preventing ovulation, fertilization, or im-plantation. It does not disrupt an established pregnancyand should not be confused with mifepristone (RU-486), adrug approved by the Food and Drug Administration forabortion in the first 49 days of gestation. Emergencycontraception is most effective if the first dose is takenwithin 12 hours of the rape; it becomes less effective with every 12 hours of delay thereafter. Assessing for PTSD Nurses can begin to assess the extent to which a sur-vivor is suffering from PTSD by asking the followingquestions: To assess the presence of intrusive thoughts: Do upsetting thoughts and nightmares of the trauma bother you? Nursing Care Plan 9.1 OVERVIEW OF THE WOMAN WHOISAVICTIM OF RAPE Lucia, a 20-year-old college junior, was admitted to the emergency room after police found her when a passerby called 911 to report an assault. She stated, \"I think I was raped a few hours ago while I was walking home through the park.\" As-sessment reveals the following: numerous cuts and bruises of varying sizes on her face, arms, and legs; lip swollen and cut;right eye swollen and bruised; jacket and shirt ripped and bloodied; hair matted with grass and debris; vital signs withinacceptable parameters; client tearful, clutching her clothing, and trembling; perineal bruising and tearing. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Rape-trauma syndrome related to report of recent sexual assault Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will demonstrate adequate coping skills related to effects of rape as evidenced by her ability to discuss the event, verbalize her feelings and fears, and exhibit appropriate actions to return to her pre-crisis level of functioning. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Coping Skills Stay with the client to promote feelings of safety. Explain the procedures to be completed based on facility's policy to help alleviate client's fear of the unknown. Assist with physical examination for specimen collection to obtain evidence for legal proceedings. Administer prophylactic medication as ordered to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Provide care to wounds as ordered to prevent infection. Assist client with hygiene measures as necessary to promote self-esteem. Allow client to describe the events as much as possible to encourage ventilation of feelings about the incident; engage in active listening and offer nonjudgmental support to facilitate coping and demonstrate understanding of the client's situation and feelings. Help the client identify positive coping skills and personal strengths used in the past to aid in effective decision making. Assist client in developing additional coping strategies and teach client relaxation techniques to help deal with the current crisis and anxiety. Contact the rape counselor in the facility to help the client deal with the crisis. Arrange for follow-up visit with rape counselor to provide continued care and to promote continuity of care. Encourage the client to contact a close friend, partner, or family member to accompany her home to provide support. Provide the client with the telephone number of a counseling service or community support groups to help her cope and obtain ongoing support. Provide written instructions related to follow-up appointments, care, and testing to ensure adequate understanding.11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 229230 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN Do you feel as though you are actually reliving the trauma? Does it upset you to be exposed to anything that reminds you of that event? To assess the presence of avoidance reactions: Do you nd yourself trying to avoid thinking about the trauma? Do you stay away from situations that remind you of the event? Do you have trouble recalling exactly what happened? Do you feel numb emotionally? To assess the presence of physical symptoms: Are you having trouble sleeping? Have you felt irritable or experienced outbursts of anger? Do you have heart palpitations and sweating? Do you have muscle aches and pains all over? (Kiump, 2006) Female Genital Mutilation Female genital mutilation , also known as female cir- cumcision, is a cultural practice carried out predominantlyin countries of southern Africa and in some areas of theMiddle East and Asia. The World Health Organization(WHO) defines female genital mutilation as all proce-dures involving the partial or total removal or other in-jury to the female genital organs, whether for cultural or other nontherapeutic purposes (WHO, 2007). More than140 million girls are estimated to have undergone femalegenital mutilation and another 2 million are at risk annu-ally, approximately 6,000 daily (WHO, 2007). This issue has drawn increasing global attention over the past several years. Nongovernmental organizationssuch as Amnesty International are conducting research andcampaign work on the practice. The U.S. government hastaken steps to criminalize the practice in America and nowconsiders asylum applications in light of mutilation prac-tices in the country of origin (WHO, 2007). WHO is ght-ing tirelessly to eradicate this practice through advocacy,policy development, research, and training for health careproviders (Zaidi et al., 2007). In fact, WHO, the UnitedNations Population Fund, and the United Nations Chil-dren's Fund have issued a joint plea for the eradication ofthe practice, saying it would be a major step forward in thepromotion of human rights worldwide (WHO, 2007).consider it a rite of passage into womanhood; others use it as a means of preserving virginity until marriage. In cul-tures where it is practiced, it is an important part of cul-turally dened gender identity. In any case, all the reasonsare cultural and traditional and are not rooted in any reli-gious texts (RAINBO, 2007). Female genital mutilationcauses injury to women and does not benet them. Female genital mutilation is usually performed when the girl is between 4 and 10 years old, an age when she can-not give informed consent for a procedure with lifetimehealth consequences (WHO, 2007). In its mildest form,the clitoris is partially or totally removed. In the ex-treme form, called inbulation, the clitoris, labia minora,labia majora, urethral and vaginal openings are cutaway. The vagina is then stitched or held together, leavinga small opening for menstruation and urination. Cuttingand restitching may be necessary to permit the womanto have sexual intercourse and bear children. Box 9.4 liststypes of female genital mutilation procedures. Untrained village practitioners, using no form of anes- thesia, generally perform the operation. Cutting instru-ments may include broken glass, knives, tin lids, scissors,unspecialized razors, or other crude instruments. In addi-tion to causing intense pain, the procedure carries with ita number of health risks, including: Pelvic infections Hemorrhage HIV infection Damage to the urethra, vagina, and anus Recurrent vaginitis Urinary tract infections Incontinence Post-traumatic stress disorder Panic attacks From a Western perspective, female genital mutilation is hard to comprehend. Because it is not talked about openly in communities that practiceit, women who have undergone it accept it without ques-tion and assume it is done to all girls (Wakabi 2007).Take NOTE! Background Reasons for performing the ritual reflect the ideology and cultural values of each community that practices it. SomeBOX 9.4 Four Major Types of Female Genital Mutilation Procedures Type I: Excision of the prepuce with or without excision of part or all of the clitoris Type II: Excision of the clitoris and part or all of the labia minora Type III (Inbulation): Excision of all or part of the external genitalia and stitching/narrowing of thevaginal opening Type IV: Pricking, piercing, or incision of the clitoris or labia Stretching of the clitoris and/or labiaCauterizing by burning the clitoris and surrounding tissues Scraping or cutting the vaginal orice Introduction of a corrosive substance into the vagina Placing herbs into the vagina to narrow it Sources: WHO, 2007; Keleher & Dysmenorrhea Dyspareunia Psychosomatic illnesses Depression Feelings of betrayal Bitterness and anger towards family members who allowed it Increased morbidity and mortality during childbirth (WHO, 2007) Nursing Management Because of increasing migration, nurses throughout theworld are increasingly exposed to women who have suf-fered these procedures and thus need to know about its impact on women's reproductive health. Helpingwomen who have had one of these procedures requiresgood communication skills and often an interpreter,since many may not speak English. Nurses have the op-portunity to educate patients by providing accurate in-formation and positive health care experiences. Makesure that you are comfortable with your own feelingsabout this practice before dealing with patients. Someguidelines are as follows: Let the client know you are concerned and interested and want to help. Speak clearly and slowly, using simple, accurate terms. Use the term or name for this practice the recipient uses, not \"female genital mutilation.\" Use pictures and diagrams to help the woman under- stand what you are saying. Be patient in allowing the client to answer questions. Repeat back your understanding of the client's statements. Always look and talk directly to the client, not the interpreter. Place no judgment on the cultural practice. Encourage the client to express herself freely. Maintain strict condentiality. Provide culturally competent care to all women. Human Trafcking A girl who was just 14 years old was held captive in a tinytrailer room, where she was forced to have sex with asmany as 30 men a day. On her night stand was a teddybear that reminded her of her childhood in Mexico. This scenario describes human trafcking , the en- slavement of immigrants for prot in America. Humantrafcking is both a global problem and a domestic prob-lem. The United States is a major receiver of trafckedpersons. Human trafcking is a modern form of slaverythat affects nearly 1 million people worldwide and approx-imately 20,000 persons in the United States annuallyCHAPTER 9 VIOLENCE AND ABUSE 231 (U.S. Department of State, 2007). Women and children are the primary victims of human trafcking, many in thesex trade as described above and others through forced-labor domestic servitude. Trafcking persons is hugely protable: one estimate places global prots at approximately $32 billion annu-ally. Among illegal enterprises, trafcking is second onlyto drug dealing and is tied with the illegal arms industryin its ability to generate dollars (Jones et al., 2007). The United States is a protable destination country for trafckers, and these prots contribute to the develop-ment of organized criminal enterprises worldwide. Accord-ing to ndings of the Victims of Trafcking and ViolenceProtection Act of 2000: Victims are primarily women and children who lack education, employment, and economic opportunitiesin their own countries. Trafckers promise victims employment as nannies, maids, dancers, factory workers, sales clerks, or mod-els in the United States. Trafckers transport the victims from their counties to unfamiliar destinations away from their support systems. Once they are here, trafckers coerce them, using rape, torture, starvation, imprisonment, threats, orphysical force, into prostitution, pornography, sextrade, forced labor, or involuntary servitude. These victims are exposed to serious and numerous health risks, such as rape, torture, HIV/AIDS, sexuallytransmitted infections, cervical cancer, violence, haz-ardous work environments, poor nutrition, and drugand alcohol addiction (Hodge & Lietz, 2007). Healthcare is one of the most pressing needs of these victims,and there isn't any comprehensive care available for un-documented immigrants. As a nurse it is important tobe alert for trafficking victims in any setting and to rec-ognize cues (Box 9.5). Human trafficking is a violation of human rights. If you suspect a trafcking situation, notify local law enforce-ment and a regional social service organization that has ex-perience in dealing with trafcking victims. It is imperativeto reach out to these victims and stop the cycle of abuse byfollowing through on your suspicions. Summary The causes of violence against women are complex. Manywomen will experience some type of violence in their lives,and it can have a debilitating affect on their health andfuture relationships. Violence frequently leaves a \"legacyof pain\" to future generations. Nurses can empowerwomen and encourage them to move forward and takecontrol of their lives. When women live in peace and se-curity and free from violence, they have an enormous po- tential to contribute to their own communities and to the11223-09_CH09.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 231232 UNIT TWO WOMEN'SHEALTH THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN national and global society.

For conception to occur, a healthyovum from the woman is released from the ovary, passesinto an open fallopian tube, and starts its journey down-ward. Sperm from the male is deposited into the vaginaand swims approximately 7 inches to meet the ovum at theoutermost portion of the fallopian tube, the area wherefertilization takes place (Gilbert, 2007). When one sperma-tozoon penetrates the ovum's thick outer membrane, preg-nancy begins. All this activity takes place within a 5-hour time span. Nurses caring for the childbearing family need to have a basic understanding of conception and prenatal devel-opment so they can identify problems or variations andcan initiate appropriate interventions should any problemsoccur. This chapter presents an overview of fetal develop-ment, beginning with conception. It also discusses hered-itary influences on fetal development and the nurse's role in genetic counseling. Fetal Development Fetal development during pregnancy is measured in num-ber of weeks after fertilization. The duration of preg-nancy is about 40 weeks from the time of fertilization.This equates to 9 calendar months or approximately 266to 280 calendar days. The three stages of fetal develop-ment during pregnancy are: 1.Preembryonic stage: fertilization through the second week 2.Embryonic stage: end of the second week through the eighth week 3.Fetal stage: end of the eighth week until birth Fetal circulation is a signicant aspect of fetal devel- opment that spans all three stages. Preembryonic Stage The preembryonic stage begins with fertilization , also called conception. Fertilization is the union of ovum and sperm, which is the starting point of pregnancy. Fertiliza-tion typically occurs around 2 weeks after the last normalmenstrual period in a 28-day cycle (Dillon, 2007). Fer-tilization requires a timely interaction between the releaseof the mature ovum at ovulation and the ejaculation ofenough healthy, mobile sperm to survive the hostile vagi-nal environment through which they must travel to meetthe ovum. All things considered, the act of conceptionis difficult at best. To say merely that it occurs when thesperm unites with the ovum is overly simple because thisunion requires an intricate interplay of hormonal prepa-ration and overcoming an overwhelming number of nat-ural barriers. A human being is truly an amazing outcome of this elaborate process.238 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Prior to fertilization, the ovum and the spermatozoon undergo the process of meiosis. The primary oocyte com-pletes its rst meiotic division before ovulation. The sec-ondary oocyte begins its second meiotic division just beforeovulation. Primary and secondary spermatocytes undergomeiotic division while still in the testes (Fig. 10.1). Although each milliliter of ejaculated semen contains more than 200 million sperm, only one is able to enter theovum to fertilize it. All others are blocked by the clear pro-tein layer called the zona pellucida . The zona pellucida disappears in about 5 days. Once the sperm reaches theplasma membrane, the ovum resumes meiosis and formsa nucleus with half the number of chromosomes (23).When the nucleus from the ovum and the nucleus of thesperm make contact, they lose their respective nuclearmembranes and combine their maternal and paternalchromosomes. Because each nucleus contains a haploidnumber of chromosomes (23), this union restores thediploid number (46). The resulting zygote begins the process of a new life. The genetic information from bothovum and sperm establishes the unique physical character-istics of the individual. Sex determination is also deter-mined at fertilization and depends on whether the ovum isfertilized by a Y-bearing sperm or an X-bearing sperm. AnXX zygote will become a female and an XY zygote willbecome a male (Fig. 10.2). Fertilization takes place in the outer third of the ampulla of the fallopian tube. When the ovum is fertil-ized by the sperm (now called a zygote), a great deal of activity immediately takes place. Mitosis, or cleavage, occurs as the zygote is slowly transported into the uterinecavity by tubal muscular movements (Fig. 10.3). After aseries of four cleavages, the 16 cells appear as a solid ballof cells or morula , meaning \"little mulberry.\" The morula reaches the uterine cavity about 72 hours after fertilization(Johnson, 2007). With additional cell division, the morula divides into specialized cells that will later form fetal structures.Within the morula, an off-center, fluid-filled space ap-pears, transforming it into a hollow ball of cells called ablastocyst (Fig. 10.4). The inner surface of the blasto- cyst will form the embryo and amnion. The outer layerof cells surrounding the blastocyst cavity is called a tro- phoblast . Eventually, the trophoblast develops into one of embryonic membranes, the chorion, and helps toform the placenta. At this time, the developing blastocyst needs more food and oxygen to keep growing. The trophoblast attachesitself to the surface of the endometrium for further nourish-ment. Normally, implantation occurs in the upper uterus(fundus), where a rich blood supply is available. This areaalso contains strong muscular bers, which clamp downon blood vessels after the placenta separates from the innerwall of the uterus. Additionally, the lining is thickest hereso the placenta cannot attach so strongly that it remainsH (text continues on page 240)11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 238CHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 239 FIGURE10.1 The formation of gametes by the process of meiosis is known as gametogenesis.

Box 10.1 summarizes preembryonicdevelopment. Despite the intense and dramatic activities going on internally to create a human life, many women are unawarethat pregnancy has begun. Several weeks will pass beforeBOX 10.1 Summary of Preembryonic Development Fertilization takes place in ampulla of the fallopian tube. Union of sperm and ovum forms a zygote (46 chromosomes). Cleavage cell division continues to form a morula (mass of 16 cells). The inner cell mass is called blastocyst, which forms the embryo and amnion. The outer cell mass is called trophoblast, which forms the placenta and chorion. Implantation occurs 7 to 10 days after conception in the endometrium.FIGURE10.4 Blastocyst.

Concurrent with the development of the trophoblast and implantation, further differentiation of the innercell mass occurs. Some of the cells become the embryoitself, and others give rise to the membranes that sur-round and protect it. The three embryonic layers of cellsformed are: 1. Ectoderm\u2014forms the central nervous system, special senses, skin, and glands 2. Mesoderm\u2014forms the skeletal, urinary, circulatory, and reproductive organs 3.

As the embryo grows, the amnion expands until it touches thechorion. These two fetal membranes form the fluid-lledamniotic sac, or bag of waters, that protects the floatingembryo (Creatsas, Chrousos, & Mastorakos, 2007). Amniotic fluid surrounds the embryo and increases in volume as the pregnancy progresses, reaching approxi-mately a liter at term. Amniotic fluid is derived from twosources: fluid transported from the maternal blood acrossthe amnion and fetal urine. Its volume changes constantlyas the fetus swallows and voids. Sufficient amounts ofamniotic fluid help maintain a constant body tempera-turefor the fetus, permit symmetric growth and develop- ment, cushion the fetus from trauma, allow the umbilical cord to be relatively free from compression, and pro mote Week 3 Beginning development of brain, spinal cord, and heart Beginning development of the gastrointestinal tractNeural tube forms, which later becomes the spinal cordLeg and arm buds appear and grow out from body Week 4 Brain differentiatesLimb buds grow and develop more Week 5 Heart now beats at a regular rhythmBeginning structures of eyes and earsSome cranial nerves are visibleMuscles innervated Week 6 Beginning formation of lungsFetal circulation establishedLiver produces RBCsFurther development of the brainPrimitive skeleton formsCentral nervous system formsBrain waves detectable Week 7 Straightening of trunkNipples and hair follicles formElbows and toes visibleArms and legs moveDiaphragm formedMouth with lips and early tooth budsWeek 8 Rotation of intestinesFacial features continue to developHeart development completeResembles a human being (Ratner, 2002) Weeks 9-12 Sexual differentiation continuesBuds for all 20 temporary teeth laid downDigestive system shows activityHead makes up nearly half the fetus sizeFace and neck are well formedUrogenital tract completes developmentRed blood cells are produced in the liverUrine begins to be produced and excretedFetal gender can be determined by week 12Limbs are long and thin; digits are well formedTABLE 10.1 EMBRYONIC AND FETALDEVELOPMENT (continued)even one of the presumptive signs of pregnancy\u2014missing the rst menstrual period\u2014will take place.

Amnio tic fluid is composed of 98% water and 2% organic matter. It is slightly alkaline vernix, ne hair called lanugo(Johnson, 2007). The volume of amniotic fluid is important in deter- mining fetal well-being. It gradually fluctuates throughoutthe pregnancy. Alterations in amniotic fluid volume canbe associated with problems in the fetus. Too little amni-otic fluid (<500 mL at term), termed oligohydramnios, isCHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 243 associated with uteroplacental insufciency and fetal renal abnormalities. Too much amniotic fluid (>2,000 mL atterm), termed hydramnios, is associated with maternal diabetes, neural tube defects, chromosomal deviations,and malformations of the central nervous system and/orgastrointestinal tract that prevent normal swallowing ofamniotic fluid by the fetus (Gilbert, 2007). While the placenta is developing (end of the second week), the umbilical cord is also formed from the amnion.It is the lifeline from the mother to the growing embryo. Itcontains one large vein and two small arteries. Wharton'sjelly (a specialized connective tissue) surrounds these threeblood vessels in the umbilical cord to prevent compres- sion, which would cut off fetal blood and nutrient supply.At term, the average umbilical cord is 22 inches long andabout an inch wide (Johnson, 2007). The precursor cells of the placenta\u2014the trophoblasts\u2014 rst appear 4 days after fertilization as the outer layer ofcells of the blastocyst. These early blastocyst trophoblastsdifferentiate into all the cells that form the placenta . When fully developed, the placenta serves as the interfacebetween the mother and the developing fetus. As early as3 days after conception, the trophoblasts make humanchorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that ensuresthat the endometrium will be receptive to the implantingembryo. During the next few weeks the placenta beginsto make hormones that control the basic physiology of themother in such a way that the fetus is supplied with thenutrients and oxygen needed for growth. The placentaalso protects the fetus from immune attack by the mother,removes waste products from the fetus, induces the motherto bring more food to the placenta, and, near the time ofdelivery, produces hormones that ready fetal organs forlife outside the uterus (Johnson, 2007). Theoretically, at no time during pregnancy does the mother's blood mix with fetal blood because thereis no direct contact between their bloods; layers of fetalFIGURE10.6 Embryonic development.

FIGURE10.7 The embryo is floating in amniotic fluid, surrounded by the protective fetal membranes (amnion and A B 8/4/08 2:51 PM Page 243tissue always separate the maternal blood and the fetal blood. These fetal tissues are called the placental barrier. Materials can be interchanged only through diffusion.The maternal uterine arteries deliver the nutrients to theplacenta, which in turn provides nutrients to the devel-oping fetus; the mother's uterine veins carry fetal waste products away. The structure of the placenta is usuallycompleted by week 12. The placenta is not only a transfer organ but a factory as well. It produces several hormones necessary for normalpregnancy: hCG\u2014preserves the corpus luteum and its progesterone production so that the endometrial lining of the uterusis maintained; this is the basis for pregnancy tests Human placental lactogen (hPL)\u2014modulates fetal and maternal metabolism, participates in the developmentof maternal breasts for lactation, and decreases maternalinsulin sensitivity to increase its availability for fetalnutrition Estrogen (estriol)\u2014causes enlargement of a contractility Progesterone (progestin)\u2014maintains the endometrium, decreases the contractility of the uterus, stimulatesmaternal metabolism and breast development, providesnourishment for the early conceptus Relaxin\u2014acts synergistically with progesterone to maintain pregnancy, causes relaxation of the pelvicligaments, softens the cervix in preparation for birth(Alvero & Schlaff, 2006) The placenta acts as a pass-through between the mother and fetus, not a barrier. Almost everything themother ingests (food, alcohol, drugs) passes through tothe developing conceptus. This is why it is so importantto advise pregnant women not to use drugs, alcohol, andtobacco, because they can be harmful to the conceptus. During the embryonic stage, the conceptus grows rap- idly as all organs and structures are forming. During this critical period of differentiation the growing embryois most susceptible to damage from external sources,including teratogens (substances that cause birth defects, such as alcohol and drugs), infections (such as rubella orcytomegalovirus), radiation, and nutritional deciencies. Fetal Stage The average pregnancy lasts 280 days from the rst dayof the last menstrual period. The fetal stage is the timefrom the end of the eighth week until birth. It is the longestperiod of prenatal development. During this stage, theconceptus is mature enough to be called a fetus. Althoughall major systems are present in their basic form, dramaticgrowth and renement of all organ systems take place dur-ing the fetal period (see Table 10.1). Figure 10.8 depicts a12- to 15-week-old fetus.244 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Fetal Circulation The circulation through the fetus during uterine life differs from that of a child or an adult. Fetal circulation involvesthe circulation of blood from the placenta to and throughthe fetus, and back to the placenta. A properly functioningfetal circulation system is essential to sustain the fetus.Before it develops, nutrients and oxygen diffuse throughthe extraembryonic coelom and the yolk sac from the pla-centa. As the embryo grows, its nutrient needs increase and the amount of tissue easily reached by diffusion in-creases. Thus, the circulation must develop quickly andaccurately (Blackburn, 2007). The circulatory system of the fetus functions much differently from that of a newborn. The most signicantdifference is that oxygen is received from the placenta dur-ing fetal life and via the lungs after birth. In addition, thefetal liver does not perform the metabolic functions that itwill after birth because the mother's body performs thesefunctions. Three shunts also are present during fetal life: 1. Ductus venosus\u2014connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava 2. Ductus arteriosus\u2014connects the main pulmonary artery to the aorta 3. Foramen ovale\u2014anatomic opening between the right and left atriumFIGURE10.8 Fetal develop- ment: 12- to 15-week fetus. Fetal circulation functions to carry highly oxygenated blood to vital areas (e.g., heart, brain) while rst shunting it away from less importantones (e.g., lungs, liver). The placenta essentially takesover the functions of the lungs and liver during fetallife. As a result, large volumes of oxygenated bloodare not needed.Take NOTE! The oxygenated blood is carried from the placenta to the fetus via the umbilical vein. About half of this blood 11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:52 PM Page 244passes through the hepatic capillaries and the rest flows through the ductus venosus into the inferior vena cava.Blood is mostly deflected through theforamen ovale into the left atrium, then to the left ven-tricle, into the ascending aorta, and on to the head andupper body. This allows the fetal coronary circulationand the brain to receive the blood with the highest levelof oxygenation. Deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava flows into the right atrium, the right ventricle, and then the pul-monary artery. Because of high pulmonary vascular resist-ance, only a small percentage (5% to 10%) of the bloodin the pulmonary artery flows to the lungs; the majority isshunted through the patent ductus arteriosus and then tothe descending aorta (Blackburn, 2007). lungsare essentially nonfunctional because they are lled withfluid, making them resistant to incoming blood flow. Theyreceive only enough blood for proper nourishment. Finally,two umbilical arteries carry the unoxygenated blood fromthe descending aorta back to the placenta. At birth, a dramatic change in the fetal circulatory pat- tern occurs. The foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus, vessels are no longer needed. Withthe newborn's rst breath, the lungs inflate, which leads toan increase in blood flow to the lungs from the right ven-tricle. This increase raises the pressure in the left atrium, causing a one-way flap on the left side of the foramen ovale,called the septum primum, to press against the opening,creating a functional separation between the two atria.Blood flow to the lungs increases because blood enteringthe right atrium can no longer bypass the right ventricle.As a result, the right ventricle pumps blood into the pul-monary artery and on to the lungs. The ductus venosus closes with the clamping of the umbilical cord and inhibi-tion of blood flow through the umbilical vein. The ductusarteriosus constricts partly in response to the higher arte-rial oxygen levels that occur after the rst few breaths. Thisclosure prevents blood from the aorta from entering thepulmonary artery (Blackburn, 2007). All of these changesleave the newborn with the typical adult pattern of circu-lation. Figure 10.9 shows fetal circulation. Genetics Genetics is the study of heredity and its variation (Brooks, 2008). According to the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), birth defects and genetic disordersoccur in about 3% of all infants born in the United States(CDC, 2007). Traditionally, genetics has been associatedwith making decisions about childbearing and caringfor chil dren with genetic disorders. Recently, genetic and technologic advances are expanding our understanding ofhow genetic changes affect human diseases such as dia-betes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other multifacto-rial diseases that are prevalent in adults (Dolan, Biermann,& Damus, 2007). Our ability to diagnose genetic condi-CHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 245 Today, nurses are required to have basic skills and knowledge in genetics, genetic testing, and genetic coun-seling so they can assume new roles and provide informa-tion and support to women and their families. Advances in Genetics Recent advances in genetic knowledge and technology haveaffected all areas of health. These advances have increasedthe number of health interventions that can be undertakenwith regard to genetic disorders. For example, genetic di-agnosis is now possible before conception and very earlyin pregnancy (see Evidence-Based Practice 10.1). Genetictesting can now identify presymptomatic conditions inchildren and adults. Gene therapy can be used to replaceor repair defective or missing genes with normal ones. Genetherapy has been used for a variety of disorders, includingcystic fibrosis, melanoma, diabetes, HIV, and hepatitis(Newman & Bettinger, 2007). The potential exists for cre-ation of increased intelligence and size through genetic intervention. Genetic agents may replace drugs, generalsurgery may be replaced by gene surgery, and genetic in-tervention may replace radiation (Erlen, 2006). It may alsobe used to treat many chronic illnesses. The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an inter- national 13-year effort to produce a comprehensive se-quence of the human genome. It was started in 1990 by the Department of Energy and the National Institutes ofHealth and was completed in May 2003. It has broughtadvances to the field of genetics and genetic testing (Jenkins & Calzone, 2007). An individual's genome represents his or her genetic blueprint, which determinesgenotype (the gene pairs inherited from parents; the spe- cic genetic makeup) and phenotype (observed outward characteristics of an individual) (Muzny et al., 2006). A primary goal of the HGP was to translate the nd- ings into new strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, andtreatment of genetic diseases and disorders. Two keyndings from the project were that all human beings are99.9% identical at the DNA level, and approximately 30,000 genes make up the human genome (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2007).

However, accurate diagnosis has led to im-proved treatment and outcomes for those affected withthese disorders.11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:52 PM Page 245informa be accessed at: http:// www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genomehome.shtml #index. Current and potential applications for the HGP in health care include rapid and more specic diagnosis of dis-ease, with hundreds of genetic tests available in research or246 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY clinical practice; earlier detection of genetic predisposition to disease; less emphasis on treating the symptoms of a dis-ease and more emphasis on looking at the fundamentalcauses of the disease; new classes of drugs; avoidance of en-vironmental conditions that may trigger disease; and aug-mentation or replacement of defective genes through geneFIGURE10.9 Fetal circulation. Arrows indicate the path of blood. The umbilical vein carries oxygen-rich blood from the placenta to the liver and through the ductus venosus. Fromthere it is carried to the inferior vena cava to the right atrium of the heart. Some of the bloodis shunted through the foramen ovale to the left side of the heart, where it is routed to thebrain and upper extremities. The rest of the blood travels down to the right ventricle andthrough the pulmonary artery. A small portion of the blood travels to the nonfunctioninglungs, while the remaining blood is shunted through the ductus arteriosus into the aorta tosupply the rest of the body.

Preimplantation genetic screening for abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidies) in in vitrofertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD005291.DOI:10.1002/14651858.CD005291.pub2.Assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertil- ization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) involve the transfer of an embryo to the mother to achievepregnancy. The physician selects the embryos for transferbased on specic criteria related to their structure andform. These \"good-quality\" embryos are then implanted in the mother in the hopes of achieving a pregnancy. Unfortunately, many women do not experience a pregnancy.The reasons for these failures are not known. One beliefis that the embryos being transferred, although they meetthe criteria for structure and form, may have an abnormalnumber of chromosomes, which affects implantation andthe development of a pregnancy. Preimplantation geneticscreening (PGS) is a tool being used to identify embryosof good quality with the normal number of chromosomes.Based on the screening, only these embryos are implanted;in theory, this would increase the rate of pregnancy. How-ever, there are questions as to how effective PGS is in improving the rates of pregnancy and live birth. Study Two independent authors used predetermined qualitycriteria to collect and analyze data from numerous databases, registers, and reference lists of articles. Theresearchers also gathered additional data from other authors as necessary. The researchers selected all relevantrandomized controlled trials dealing with IVF or ICSI with andwithout PGS. The primary outcome was the live birth rate.The researchers reviewed two randomized controlled trials, both involving IVF or ICSI with and without the use of PGS.The group without PGS was considered the control group.The trials also involved women of advanced maternal age(over age 35). Findings Compared with the control group, the PGS group did notshow signicant differences in the live birth rate. Therewere also no signicant differences in the rates of ongoingpregnancy. The researchers noted that these findingswere limited by the small number of trials (two trials), theadvanced maternal age, and the sample size of the one trial (39 women). Based on this study, the researcherscould not nd evidence to support routine use of PGS tofacilitate pregnancy. They recommended more in-depthrandomized trials to evaluate this technology. Nursing Implications Although the study failed to support the effectiveness of PGS, nurses need to be aware of the emerging technologyand techniques associated with genetics so that they canprovide women and their families with the most appropriateinformation about options and therapies. Nurses can incorporate information from this study in their teaching,anticipatory guidance, and counseling about options sothat the couple can make the best-informed decisionpossible. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 10.1 Is Preimplantation Genetic Screening Effective in Promoting Pregnancy With Assisted Reproductive Technologies? therapy. This new genetic knowledge and technology, along with the commercialization of this knowledge, willchange both professional and parental understanding of genetic disorders. The potential benefits of these discoveries are vast, but so is the potential for misuse. These advances chal-lenge all health care professionals to consider the manyethical, legal, and social ramifications of genetics inhuman lives. In the near future, individual risk profil-ing based on an individual's unique genetic makeupwill be used to tailor prevention, treatment, and ongo-ing management of health conditions. This profilingwill raise issues associated with patient privacy andconfidentiality related to workplace discrimination andaccess to health insurance. Issues of autonomy are equally problematic as society considers how to address the injus-tices that will inevitably surface when disease risk can bedetermined years before the disease occurs. Nurses willplay an important role in developing policies and provid- ing direction and support in this arena, and to do so theywill need a basic understanding of genetics, includinginheritance and inheritance patterns.

Inheritance The nucleus within the cell is the controlling factor in all cellular activities because it contains chromosomes, longcontinuous strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) thatcarry genetic information. Each chromosome is made upof genes . Genes are individual units of heredity of all traits and are organized into long segments of DNA that occupy a specic location on a chromosome and determine a par-ticular characteristic in an organism.11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:52 PM Page 247248 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY DNA stores genetic information and encodes the in- structions for synthesizing specic proteins needed to maintain life. DNA is double-stranded and takes theform of a double helix. The side pieces of the double helixare made up of a sugar, deoxyribose, and a phosphate,occurring in alternating groups. The cross-connectionsor rungs of the ladder are attached to the sides and aremade up of four nitrogenous bases: adenine, cytosine,thymine, and guanine. The sequence of the base pairsas they form each rung of the ladder is referred to as thegenetic code (Fig. 10.10; Wright & Hastie, 2007). Each gene has a segment of DNA with a specic set of instructions for making proteins needed by body cellsfor proper functioning. Genes control the types of proteinsmade and the rate at which they are produced (Dolan,Biermann, & Damus, 2007). Any change in gene structureor location leads to a mutation , which may alter the type and amount of protein produced (Fig. 10.11). Genesnever act in isolation; they always interact with other genesand the environment. They are arranged in a specic lin-ear formation along a chromosome. The genotype, the specic genetic makeup of an indi- vidual, usually in the form of DNA, is the internally coded inheritable information. It refers to the particular allele , which is one of two or more alternative versions of geneat a given position or locus on a chromosome that impartsthe same characteristic of that gene. For instance, eachhuman has a gene that controls height, but there are vari-ations of these genes, which are alleles, in accordance with the specic height for which the gene codes. A gene thatcontrols eye color may have an allele that can produceblue eyes or an allele that produces brown eyes. The geno-type, together with environmental variation that influencesthe individual, determines the phenotype, or the observed,outward characteristics of an individual. A human inher-its two genes, one from each parent. Therefore, one allele FIGURE10.10 DNA is made up of four chemical bases. Tightly coiled strands of DNA are packaged in units called chromo-somes, housed in the cell's nucleus. Working subunits ofDNA are known as genes.

These alleles may be the same for the characteristic ( homozy- gous ) or different homozygous dominant; ww stands for homozy-gous recessive. Heterozygous would be indicated as Ww.If the two alleles differ, such as Ww, the dominant one willusually be expressed in the phenotype of the individual. Human beings typically have 46 chromosomes. This includes 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes or autosomesand 1 pair of sex chromosomes (two X chromosomes infemales, and an X chromosome and a Y chromosome inmales). Offspring receive one chromosome of each of the23 pairs from each parent. Regulation and expression of the thousands of human genes is very complex and is the result of many intricateinteractions within each cell. Alterations in gene structure,function, transcription, translation, and protein synthesiscan influence an individual's health (Wright & Hastie,2007). Gene mutations are a permanent change in thesequence of DNA. Some mutations have no significanteffect, whereas others can have a tremendous impact onthe health of the individual. Several genetic disorders suchas cystic brosis, sickle-cell disease, phenylketonuria, orhemophilia, can result from these mutations. The pictorial analysis of the number, form, and size of an individual's chromosomes is termed the karyotype . This analysis commonly uses white blood cells and fetalCHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 249 cells in amniotic fluid. The chromosomes are numbered from the largest to the smallest, 1 to 22, and the sex chro-mosomes are designated by the letter X or Y. A femalekaryotype is designated as 46,XX and a male karyotypeis designated as 46,XY. Figure 10.12 illustrates an exam-ple of a karyotyping pattern. Patterns of Inheritance A genetic disorder is a disease caused by an abnormalityin an individual's genetic material or genome. Diagnosisof a genetic disorder is usually based on clinical signs andsymptoms or on laboratory conrmation of an alteredgene associated with the disorder. Accurate diagnosis canbe aided by the recognition of the pattern of inheritancewithin a family. The pattern of inheritance is also vital tounderstand when teaching and counseling families aboutthe risks in future pregnancies. Some genetic disordersoccur in multiple family members, while others may occurin only a single family member. A genetic disorder is causedby completely or partially altered genetic material, whilea familial disorder is more common in relatives of theaffected individual but may be caused by environmentalinfluences and not genetic alterations. Monogenic Disorders Patterns of inheritance demonstrate how a genetic disordercan be passed on to offspring. Principles of genetic disease FIGURE10.12 Karyotype pattern. ( A) Normal female karyotype. ( karyotype. AB11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:52 PM Page 249inheritance of single-gene disorders are the same principles that govern the inheritance of other traits, such as eye andhair color. These are known as Mendel's laws of inheri- tance, named for the genetic work of Gregor Mendel, an Austrian naturalist. These patterns occur due to a singlegene being defective and are referred to as monogenic orsometimes Mendelian disorders. If the defect occurs onthe autosome, the genetic disorder is termed autosomal; if the defect is on the X chromosome, the genetic disorder istermed X-linked. The defect also can be classied Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Disorders Autosomal dominant inherited disorders occur when a single gene in the heterozygous state is capable of producingthe phenotype. In other words, the abnormal or mutantgene overshadows the normal gene and the individualwill demonstrate signs and symptoms of the disorder.The affected person generally has an affected parent,and an affected person has a 50% chance of passing theabnormal gene to each of his or her children (Fig. 10.13).Affected individuals are present in every generation. Malesand family members who are phenotypically normal (donot show signs or symptoms of the disorder) do not trans-mit the condition to their offspring. Females and males are equally affected and a male can pass the disorder onto his son. This male-to-male transmission is importantin distinguishing autosomal dominant inheritance fromX-linked inheritance. There are varying degrees of pre-250 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY sentation among individuals in a family. Therefore, a par- ent with a mild form could have a child with a more se-vere form. Common types of genetic disorders that followthe autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance includeneurobromatosis (genetic disorders affecting the devel- opment and growth of neural cells and tissues), Hunting-ton's disease (a genetic disorder affecting the nervoussystem characterized by abnormal involuntary move-ments and progressive dementia), achondroplasia (agenetic disorder resulting in disordered growth and abnormal body proportion), and polycystic kidney disease(a genetic disorder involving the growth of multiple, bilat-eral, grape-like clusters of fluid-lled cysts in the kidneysthat eventually replace functioning renaltissue). Autosomal Recessive Inheritance Disorders Autosomal recessive inherited disorders occur when two copies of the mutant or abnormal gene in the homozygous stateare necessary to produce the phenotype. In other words,two abnormal genes are needed for the individual todemonstrate signs and symptoms of the disorder. These disorders are generally less common than autosomal dom- inant disorders (Behrman et al., 2007). Both parents of the affected person must be heterozygous carriers of the gene(clinically normal but carry the gene), and their offspringhave a 25% chance of being homozygous (a 50% chanceof getting the mutant gene from each parent and there-fore a 25% chance of inheriting two mutant genes). If the child is clinically normal, there is a 50% chance thathe or she is a carrier (Fig. 10.14). Affected individuals FIGURE10.13 Autosomal dominant inheritance.

Females and males are equally affected and a male can pass the disorder on to his son. The chance that any twoparents will both be carriers of the mutant gene is in-creased if the couple is consanguineous (having a commonancestor). Common types of genetic disorders that fol-low the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern includecystic fibrosis (a involving generalizeddysfunction of the exocrine glands), phenylketonuria (adisorder involving a deficiency in a liver enzyme thatleads to the inability to process the essential amino acidphenylalanine), Tay-Sachs disease (a disorder due toinsufcient activity of the enzyme hexoaminodase, whichis necessary for the breakdown of certain fatty substancesin the brain and nerve cells), and sickle-cell disease (agenetic disorder in which the red blood cells carry anineffective type of hemoglobin instead of the normal adulthemoglobin). X-linked Inheritance Disorders X-linked inherited disorders are those associated with altered genes present on the X chromosome. They differ fromautosomal disorders. If a male inherits an X-linked altered gene, he will express the condition. Since a male has onlyone X chromosome, all the genes on his X chromosomewill be expressed (the Y chromosome carries no normalallele to compensate for the altered gene). Because females inherit two X chromosomes, they can be either heterozy-gous or homozygous for any allele. Therefore, X-linkeddisorders in females are expressed similarly to autosomaldisorders. Most X-linked disorders demonstrate a recessive pat- tern of inheritance. Males are more affected than females. A male has only one X chromosome and all the geneson his X chromosome will be expressed, whereas a femalewill usually need both X chromosomes to carry the dis-ease. There is no male-to-male transmission (since no Xchromosome from the male is transmitted to male off-spring), but any man who is affected will have carrierdaughters. If a woman is a carrier, there is a 50% chance that her sons will be affected and a 50% chance that herdaughters will be carriers (Fig. 10.15). Common typesof genetic disorders that follow X-linked recessive inher-itance patterns include hemophilia (a genetic disorderinvolving a deficiency of one of the coagulation factorsin the blood), color blindness, and Duchenne musculardystrophy (a disorder involving progressive muscular weak-nessand wasting). X-linked dominant inheritance is present if heterozy- gous female carriers demonstrate signs and symptoms ofthe disorder. All of the daughters and none of the sonsof an affected male have the condition, while both maleand female offspring of an affected woman have a 50%chance of inheriting and presenting with the condition(Fig. 10.16). X-linked dominant disorders are rare. Themost common is hypophosphatemic (vitamin D-resistant)CHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 251 rickets (a disorder involving a softening or weakening of the bones). Multifactorial Inheritance Disorders Multifactorial inherited disorders are thought to be caused by multiple genetic (polygenic) and environmental factors.Many of the Normal FemaleX Y X X Carrier FemaleAffected Normal pyloric stenosis, club- hip dysplasia, and cardiac defects, areattributed to multifactorial inheritance. A combination ofgenes from both parents, along with unknown environ-mental factors, produces the trait or condition. An indi- vidual may inherit a predisposition to a particular anomalyor disease. The anomalies or diseases vary in severity, andoften a sex bias is present. For example, pyloric stenosis isseen more often in males, while developmental hip dys-plasia is much more likely to occur in females. Multifac-torial conditions tend to run in families, but the pattern ofinheritance is not as predictable as with single-gene dis-orders. The chance of recurrence is also less than in single- gene disorders, but the degree of risk is related to thenumber of genes in common with the affected individual.The closer the degree of relationship, the more genes anindividual has in common with the affected family mem-ber, resulting in a higher chance that the individual's off-spring will have a similar defect. In multifactorialinheritance the likelihood that both identical twins will beaffected is not 100%, indicating that there are nongeneticfactors involved. Nontraditional Inheritance Patterns Molecular studies have revealed that some genetic dis-orders are inherited in ways that do not follow the typicalpatterns of dominant, recessive, X-linked, or multifacto-rial inheritance. Examples of nontraditional inheritance252 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY patterns include mitochondrial inheritance and genomic imprinting (Box 10.2). As the science of molecular genet-ics advances and more is learned about inheritance pat-terns, other nontraditional patterns of inheritance may bediscovered or found to be relatively common. Chromosomal Abnormalities In some cases of genetic disorders, the abnormality occurs due to problems with the chromosomes. Chromosomalabnormalities do not follow straightforward patterns ofinheritance. Sperm and egg cells each have 23 unpaired chromosomes. When they unite during pregnancy theyform a fertilized egg with 46 chromosomes. Sometimesbefore pregnancy begins, an error has occurred duringthe process of cell division, leaving an egg or sperm withtoo many or too few chromosomes. If this egg or spermcell joins with a normal egg or sperm cell, the resultingembryo has a chromosomal abnormality. Chromosomalabnormalities can also occur due to an error in the struc-ture of the chromosome. Small pieces of the chromosomemay be deleted, duplicated, inverted, misplaced, or ex-changed with part of another chromosome. Most chro-mosomal abnormalities occur due to an error in the eggor sperm. Therefore, the abnormality is present in everycell of the body. However, some abnormalities can hap-pen after fertilization during mitotic cell division and re-sult in mosaicism . Mosaicism or mosaic form refers to BOX 10.2 Nontraditional Inheritance Patterns Mitochondrial Inheritance Certain diseases result from mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria, which are the part of the cell responsi-ble for energy production, are inherited almost exclusivelyfrom the mother. Therefore, mitochondrial inheritance isusually passed from the mother to the offspring, regardless ofthe offspring's sex (differentiating mitochondrial inheritancefrom X-linked recessive inheritance). These mutations areoften deletions and abnormalities of these disorders and areoften seen in one or more specic organs, such as the brain,eye, and skeletal muscle. They are often associated withenergy decits in cells with high energy requirements, such as nerve and muscle cells. These disorders tend to be pro-gressive, and the age of onset can vary from infancy to adult-hood. There is an extreme amount of variability in symptomswithin a family. Examples of disorders that follow mitochon-drial inheritance include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, which is a neuromuscular disorder, and Leber's hereditary opticneuropathy, which causes progressive visual impairment. Genomic Imprinting Another nontraditional inheritance pattern results from aprocess called genomic imprinting. Genomic imprintingplays a critical role in fetal growth and development and placental functioning. In genomic imprinting, the expres-sion of a gene is determined by its parental origin. In genomic imprinting both the maternal and paternal allelesare present, but only one is expressed; the other is inactive.Genomic imprinting does not alter the genetic sequenceitself but affects the phenotype observed. In these cases the altered genes in a certain region of the genome have verydifferent expressions depending on whether they were inherited from the mother or the father. Several human syndromes are known to be associated with defects in geneimprinting. Disorders that result from a disruption of imprinting usually involve a growth phenotype and includevarying degrees of developmental problems. Common examples include Prader-Willi syndrome (a condition resulting in severe hypotonia and hyperphagia leading to obesity and mental retardation), Angelman syndrome (a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mental retardation, jerky movements, and seizures), and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (characterized by Page 252when the chromosomal abnormalities do not show up in every cell and only some cells or tissues carry the abnor-mality. In mosaic forms of the disorder, the symptoms areusually less severe than if all the cells were abnormal. About 1 in 150 live-born infants is born with a chro- mosomal abnormality (March of Dimes, 2007a). Theseoften cause major defects because they involve added ormissing genes. Congenital anomalies and mental retar-dation are often associated with chromosomal abnormal- ities. These abnormalities occur on autosomal as well assex chromosomes and can result from changes in thenumber of chromosomes or changes in the structure of thechromosomes. Numerical Abnormalities Chromosomal abnormalities of number often result dueto nondisjunction, or failure of the chromosome pair to separate during cell division, meiosis, or mitosis. Fewchromosomal numerical abnormalities are compatiblewith full-term development and most result in sponta- neous abortion. One type of abnormal chromosome num-ber is polyploidy . Polyploidy causes an increase in the number of haploid sets (23) of chromosomes in a cell.Triploidy refers to three whole sets of chromosomes ina single cell (in humans, a total of 69 chromosomes percell); tetraploidy refers to four whole sets of chromosomesin a single cell (in humans, a total of 92 chromosomes percell). Polyploidy usually results in an early spontaneousabortion and is incompatible with life. Some numerical abnormalities do support develop- ment to term because the chromosome on which the ab-normality is present carries relatively few genes (such aschromosome 13, 18, 21, or X). Two common abnormal- ities of chromosome number are monosomies or trisomies.In monosomies there is only one copy of a particular chromosome instead of the usual pair (an entire singlechromosome is missing). In these cases, all fetuses spon-taneously abort in early pregnancy. Survival is seen only inmosaic forms of these disorders. In trisomies , there are three of a particular chromosome instead of the usual two(an entire single chromosome is added). Trisomies maybe present in every cell or may present in the mosaic form.The most common trisomies include trisomy 21 (Downsyndrome), trisomy 18, and trisomy 13. Trisomy 21 Down syndrome is an example of a trisomy. Individualswith Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21(Fig. 10.17). Down syndrome affects 1 in 800 to 1,000 live-born babies. The risk of this and other trisomies increaseswith maternal age. The risk of having a baby with Downsyndrome is about 1 in 1,250 for a woman at age 25, 1 in1,000 at 30, 1 in 400 at 35, and 1 in 100 at age 40 (Marchof Dimes, 2007b). Individuals with Down syndrome havecharacteristic features that are usually identied at birth(Fig. 10.18). These common characteristics include:CHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 253 Small, low-set ears Hyperflexibility Muscle hypotonia Deep crease across palm (termed simian crease) Flat facial prole Small white, crescent-shaped spots on irises Open mouth with protruding tongue Broad, short ngers (Tonkin & Kirk, 2007) The outlook for children with Down syndrome is much brighter now than it was years ago. Most childrenwith Down syndrome have mental retardation in the mildto moderate range. With early intervention and specialeducation, many learn to read and write, and participatein diverse childhood activities (March of Dimes, 2007b).Despite modern medical technology, the individual withDown syndrome has a shortened life span, with an aver-age life expectancy of 55 years (March of Dimes, 2007b). Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13 Two other common trisomies are trisomy 18 and tri-somy 13. Trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 are, respectively, the second and third most commonly diagnosed autosomaltrisomies in live-born infants. These conditions are asso-ciated with a high degree of infant mortality, with mostdying before their rst birthday (March of Dimes, 2007a).Trisomy 18, or Edward syndrome, occurs in 1 of every6,000 newborns (March of Dimes, 2007a), with advanced maternal age as a causative factor. Prenatally, several nd- ings are apparent on growth re- striction (IUGR), hydramnios or oligohydramnios, cardiacmalformations, a single umbilical artery, and decreasedfetal movement. Additionally, trisomy 18 has been asso-ciated with a decrease in maternal levels of mater-nal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and hCG. are female, with a 4:1 ratio to males.Affected newborns have 47 chromosomes (three at chro-mosome 18) and are characterized by severe mental retar-dation, growth deciency of the cranium (microcephaly),low-set ears, small for gestational age, seizures, droopingFIGURE10.17 Karyotype of a child with Down syndrome. 11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:52 PM Page 253eyelids, webbing of fingers, congenital heart defects, rocker-bottom feet, and severe hypotonia (National Orga-nization for Rare Disorders, 2008). Infants with trisomy 18have multiple anomalies that are severe, and life expectancyis greatly reduced beyond a few months. Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome, affects 1 of 10,000 newborns (March of Dimes, 2007a). Forty-seven chro-mosomes (three of chromosome 13) are present. Maternal age is also thought to be a causative factor in this geneticdisorder. The common abnormalities associated with tri-somy 13 are microcephaly, cardiac defects, central nervoussystem anomalies, cleft lip and palate, cryptorchidism,polydactyly (Fig. 10.19), severe mental retardation, se-verehypotonia, and seizures. Life expectancy is only a few months for most infants with trisomy 13. Care is support-ive for these infants. Structural Abnormalities Chromosome abnormalities of structure usually occur when there is a breakage and loss of a portion of one or254 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY more chromosomes, and during the repair process the broken ends are rejoined incorrectly. Structural abnormal-itiesusually lead to having too much or too little genetic material. Altered chromosome structure can take on several forms. Deletions occur when a portion of thechromosome is missing, resulting in a loss of that chro-mosomal material. Duplications are seen when a portion of the chromosome is duplicated and an extra chromoso-mal segment is present. Clinical ndings vary dependingon how much chromosomal material is involved. Inver-sions occur when a portion of the chromosome breaks offat two points and is turned upside down and reattached;therefore, the genetic material is inverted. With inversion,there is no loss or gain of chromosomal material andcarriers are phenotypically normal, but they do have anincreased risk for miscarriage and chromosomally ab-normal offspring. Ring chromosomes are seen when aportion of a chromosome has broken off in two placesand formed a circle. The most clinically significant structural abnormal- ity is a translocation. This occurs when part of one chro-mosome is transferred to another chromosome and anabnormal rearrangement is present. Structural abnormalities can be balanced or unbal- anced. Balanced abnormalities involve the rearrangementof genetic material with neither an overall gain nor loss.Individuals who inherit a balanced structural abnormal-ity are usually phenotypically normal but are at a higherrisk for miscarriages and having chromosomally abnormaloffspring. Examples of structural rearrangements that canbe balanced include inversions, translocation, and ringchromosomes. Unbalanced structural abnormalities aresimilar to numerical abnormalities because genetic material A FIGURE10.18 (A) Typical facial features of an infant with Down syndrome.

Unbalanced structural abnormali- ties can encompass several genes and result in severe clin- ical consequences. Cri du Chat Syndrome Cri du chat syndrome (\"cry of the cat\") is caused by amissing piece of chromosome 5. It was named \"cri duchat\" based on the distinctive cry in newborns, which isdue to a laryngeal defect. The incidence of the disorderis thought to be approximately 1 in 50,000 live births(Chen, 2007a). In addition to the cat-like, high-pitchedcry in infancy, it is also associated with severe mental re-tardation, microcephaly, low birthweight and slow growth,hypotonia, failure to thrive, wide-set eyes, small jaw, low-set ears, and various organ malformations. No specifictreatment is available for this syndrome. With contem-porary interventions, the child may survive to adulthood: 75% of deaths occur during the rst several months of lifeand almost 90% occur in the first year. Death occurs in 6% to 8% of the overall population affected with thesyndrome. Pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, congen-ital heart defects, and respiratory distress are the com-mon causes of death (Chen, 2007a). Parents should be referred for genetic counseling. Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome, also termed Martin-Bell syndrome,is a structural abnormality involving the X chromosome,which demonstrates breaks and gaps. The syndrome isusually diagnosed by molecular DNA studies. Conser-vative estimates report that fragile X syndrome affectsapproximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females(Jewell, 2007). Typically, a female becomes the carrierand will be mildly affected. The male who receives theX chromosome that has a fragile site will exhibit the fulleffects of the syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is character-ized by mental retardation, hyperactivity, short attentionspan, hand flapping, strabismus, speech defensiveness, double-jointedness, and persev-erative speech (continued repetition of words or phrases).It is the most common form of male retardation (Jewell,2007). Aside from the morbidity associated with mentalretardation and cognitive/behavioral/neuropsychologicalproblems, the life span of an individual with fragile X syn-drome is unaffected. There is no cure for this disorder. Speech, occupational, and physical therapy services usuallyare needed, as well as special education and counseling. Sex Chromosome Abnormalities Chromosomal abnormalities can also involve sex chro-mosomes. These cases are usually less severe in their clin-ical effects than autosomal chromosomal abnormalities.Sex chromosome abnormalities are gender-specic andinvolve a missing or extra sex chromosome. They affectsexual development and may cause infertility, growth ab-normalities, and possibly behavioral and learning prob-CHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 255 lems. Many affected individuals lead essentially normal lives. Examples are Turner syndrome (in females) andKlinefelter's syndrome (in males). Turner Syndrome Turner syndrome is a common abnormality of the sexchromosome in which a portion or all of the X chromo-some is missing. It affects about 1 in 2,500 newborn girls (March of Dimes, 2007a). Clinical manifestations includea low posterior hairline and webbing of the neck, shortstature, broad skeletal abnormalities, a shield-like chestwith widely spaced nipples, puffy feet, underdevelopedsecondary sex characteristics, and infertility (Postellon,2007). Only about a third of cases are diagnosed as new-borns; the remaining two thirds are diagnosed in early ado-lescence when they experience primary amenorrhea. Nocure exists for this syndrome. Growth hormone typicallyis given; hormone replacement therapy also may be usedto induce puberty and stimulate continued growth. Mostfemales with Turner syndrome are of normal intelligenceand usually live essentially normal lives (Postellon, 2007). Klinefelter Syndrome Klinefelter syndrome is a sex chromosomal abnormalitythat occurs only in males. About 1 in 500 to 1,000 malesborn have Klinefelter syndrome (Chen, 2007b). There isan extra X chromosome (XXY) present. The extra geneticmaterial causes abnormal development of the testicles,resulting in decreased production of sperm and male sexhormones. Clinical manifestations may include: Mild mental retardation Small testicles Infertility Long arms and legs Enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia) Scant facial and body hair Decreased sex drive (libido) (Chen, 2007b) No treatment can correct this genetic abnormality, but testosterone replacement therapy can improve symp-toms resulting from the deciency. Surgery may be doneto reduce gynecomastia. Most males with Klinefelter syn-drome (XXY) are diagnosed in late puberty. Infertility iscommon and life expectancy is normal (Chen, 2007b). Genetic Evaluation and Counseling Genetic counseling has been dened as an educational process that assists affected and/or at-risk individuals tounderstand genetic disorders, their transmission, and theoptions available to them in management and family plan-ning (Behrman et al., 2007). There are a variety of reasonsan individual should be referred for genetic counseling.Box 10.3 lists those who may benet from genetic coun-seling. In many cases, geneticists and genetic counselorsprovide information to families regarding genetic diseases.11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:52 PM Page 255256 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY BOX 10.3 Those Who May Benet From Genetic Counseling Maternal age 35 years or older when the baby is born Paternal age 50 years or older Previous child, parents, or close relatives with an inherited disease, congenital anomalies, metabolic disorders, developmental disorders, or chromosomalabnormalities Consanguinity or incest Pregnancy screening abnormality, including alpha- fetoprotein, triple screen, amniocentesis, or ultrasound Stillborn with congenital anomalies Two or more pregnancy losses Teratogen exposure or risk Concerns about genetic defects that occur frequently in their ethnic or racial group (for instance, those ofAfrican descent are most at risk for having a child withsickle-cell anemia) Abnormal newborn screening Child born with one or more major malformations in a major organ system Child with abnormalities of growth Child with developmental delay, mental retardation, blindness, or deafness F IGURE10.20 A pedigree is a diagram made using symbols that demonstrates the links between family members and focuseson medical and health information for each relative.59 yr diabetes56 yr hypertension Unaffected male, female62 yr heart attack58 yr 31 yr 3 mo 6 yr Affected male, femaleSiblings, listed left to right by birth order Mating or marriageDeceased9 yr 14 yr 5 yr asthma8 yr 6 yr27 yr 37 yr 32 yr 15 yr drowning42 yr 44 yrHowever, an experienced family physician, pediatrician, or nurse who has received special training in genetics mayalso provide the information. A genetic consultation involves evaluation of an indi- vidual or a family. Its purposes are to conrm, diagnose,or rule out genetic conditions; to identify medical manage-ment issues; to calculate and communicate genetic risks toa family; to discuss ethical and legal issues; and to provideand arrange psychosocial support. Genetic counselors serveas educators and resource persons for other health careproviders and the general public. The ideal time for genetic counseling is before concep- tion. Preconception counseling gives couples the chanceto identify and reduce potential pregnancy risks, plan forknown risks, and establish early prenatal care. Unfor-tunately, many women delay seeking prenatal care untiltheir second or third trimester, after the crucial time oforganogenesis. Therefore, it is important that preconcep-tion counseling is offered to all women as they seek healthcare throughout their childbearing years, especially ifthey are contemplating pregnancy. This requires healthcare providers to take a proactive role. Preconception screening and counseling can raise serious ethical and moral issues for a couple. The re-sults of prenatal genetic testing can lead to the decisionto terminate a pregnancy, even if the results are not con-clusive but indicate a strong possibility that the childwill have an abnormality. The severity of the abnormal- ity may not be known, and some may find the decisionto terminate unethical. Another difficult situation thatprovides an example of the ethical and moral issues sur-rounding genetic screening and counseling involves dis-orders that affect only one gender of offspring. A mothermay nd she is a carrier of a gene for a disorder for which there is no prenatal screening test available. In thesecases the couple may decide to terminate any pregnancywhere the fetus is the affected sex, even though there isa 50% chance that the child will not inherit the disor-der. In these situations, the choice is the couple's andinformation and support must be provided in a non-directive manner. Genetic counseling is particularly important if a con- genital anomaly or genetic disease has been diagnosedprenatally or if a child is born with a life-threatening con-genital anomaly or genetic disease. In these cases familiesneed information urgently so they can make immediatedecisions. If a diagnosis with genetic implications is madelater in life, if a couple with a family history of a geneticdisorder or a previous child with a genetic disorder is plan-ning a family, or if there is suspected teratogen exposure, urgency of information is not such an issue. In these sit-uations, the family needs time to ponder all their op-tions. This may involve several meetings over a longerperiod of time. Genetic counseling involves gathering information regarding birth history, past medical history, and currenthealth status as well as a family history of congenital anom-alies, mental retardation, genetic diseases, reproductive history, general health, and causes of death. A detailedfamily history is imperative and in most cases will include the development of a pedigree, which is like a family tree(Fig. 10.20). Information is ideally gathered on three gen-erations, but if the family history is complicated, informa-11223-10_UT3-CH10.qxd 8/4/08 2:52 PM Page 256tion from more distant relatives may be needed. Families receiving genetic counseling may benet from being toldin advance that this information will be necessary; theymay need to discuss these sensitive, private issues withfamily members to obtain the needed facts. When neces-sary, medical records may be requested for family mem-bers, especially those who have a genetic disorder, to helpensure accuracy of the information. Sometimes a pedi-gree may reveal condential information not known by allfamily members, such as an adoption, a child conceivedthrough in vitro fertilization, or a husband not being thefather of a baby. Therefore, maintaining condentiality isextremely important. After careful analysis of the dataobtained, referral to a genetic counselor when indicatedis appropriate. Medical genetic knowledge has increased dramati- cally over the past few decades. Not only is it possible todetect specic diseases with genetic mutations, but it isalso possible to test for a genetic predisposition to variousdiseases or conditions and certain physical characteristics.This leads to complex ethical, moral, and social issues.Maintaining client privacy and condentiality and admin-istering care in a nondiscriminatory manner are essential while maintaining sensitivity to cultural differences. It isessential to respect client autonomy and present informa-tion in a nondirective manner. Nursing Roles and Responsibilities The nurse is likely to interact with the client in a variety of ways related to genetics\u2014taking a family history, schedul-ing genetic testing, explaining the purposes of all screeningand diagnostic tests, answering questions, and addressingconcerns raised by family members. Nurses are often therst health care providers to encounter women with pre-conception and prenatal issues. Nurses play an importantrole in beginning the preconception counseling processand referring women and their partners for further genetictesting when indicated. An accurate and thorough family history is an essen- tial part of preconception counseling. Nurses in any prac-tice setting can obtain a patient's history during the initialencounter. The purpose is to gather patient and family in-formation that may provide clues as to whether the patienthas a genetic trait, inherited condition, or inherited predis-position (Erlen, 2006). At a basic level, all nurses shouldbe able to take a family medical history to help identifythose at risk for genetic conditions, and then initiate areferral when appropriate. Box 10.4 presents examples offocused assessment questions that can be used. Based onthe information gathered during the history, the nursemust decide whether a referral to a genetic specialist is nec-essary or whether further evaluation is needed. Prenatal testing to assess for genetic risks and defects might be usedto identify genetic disorders. These tests are described inCommon Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 10.1.CHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 257 Remember Robert and Kate Shafer? Based on the information gathered from their genetic history, they werereferred to a genetic specialist. What prenatal tests might beordered to assess their risk for genetic disorders? What wouldbe the nurse's role related to genetic counseling? Nurses working with families involved with genetic counseling typically have certain responsibilities. Theseinclude: Using interviewing and active listening skills to identify genetic concerns Knowing basic genetic terminology and inheritance patterns Explaining basic concepts of probability and disorder susceptibility Safeguarding the privacy and condentiality of patients' genetic information Providing complete informed consent to facilitate decisions about genetic testing Discussing costs of genetic services and the benets and risks of using health insurance to pay for geneticservices, including potential risks of discriminationBOX 10.4 Focused Health Assessment: Genetic History What was the cause and age of death for deceased family members? Does any consanguinity exist between relatives?Do any serious illnesses or chronic conditions exist? If so, what was the age of onset? Do any female family members have a history of miscarriages, stillbirths, or diabetes? Do any female members have a history of alcohol or drug use during pregnancy? What were the ages of female members during childbearing, especially if older than 35? Do any family members have mental retardation or developmental delays? Do any family members have a known or suspected metabolic disorder such as PKU? Do any family members have an affective disorder such as bipolar disorder? Have any close relatives been diagnosed with any type of cancer? What is your ethnic background (explore as related to certain disorders)? Do any family members have a known or suspected chromosomal disorder? Do any family members have a progressive neurologic disorder?

Many timesthe nurse may be the one who has rst contact with theseparents and will be the one to provide follow-up care. Genetic disorders are significant, life-changing, and possibly life-threatening situations. The information ishighly technical and the field is undergoing significanttechnologic advances. Nurses need an understanding ofwho will benet from genetic counseling and must beable to discuss the role of the genetic counselor with fam-ilies. The goal is to ensure that families at risk are awarethat genetic counseling is available before they attempt tohave another baby. Based on the results of their genetic tests, Robert and Kate are placed at moderate risk for having an infant with anautosomal recessive genetic disorder. The couple asks thenurse what all of this means. What information should thenurse provide about concepts of probability and disordersusceptibility for this couple? How can the nurse help thiscouple to make knowledgeable decisions concerning theirreproductive future? Nurses play an essential role in providing emotional support to the family through this challenging time. Thisis especially important with follow-up counseling afterthe couple or family has been to the genetic specialist.CHAPTER 10 FETALDEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS 259 might have. Referral to appropriate agencies, support groups, and resources, such as a social worker, a chap-lain, or an ethicist, is another key role when caring forfamilies with suspected or diagnosed genetic disorders. Consider THIS! As I waited for the genetic counselor to come into the room, my mind was lled with numerous fears andquestions. What does an inconclusive amniocentesis really mean? What if this pregnancy produced an abnormal baby? How would I cope with a special childin my life? If only I had gone to the midwife soonerwhen I thought I was pregnant, but still in denial.Why did I wait so long to admit this pregnancy and getprenatal care? If only I had started to take my folic acidpills when prescribed. Why didn't I research my family'shistory to know of any hidden genetic conditions? Whatabout my sister with a Down syndrome child? Whatmust I have been thinking? I guess I could play the\"what-if\" game forever and never come up withanswers. It was too late to do anything about this preg-nancy because I was in my last trimester. I started topray silently when the counselor opened the door. . . . Thoughts: This woman is reviewing the last several months, looking for answers to her greatest fears. Inconclusive screenings can introduce emotional tormentfor many women as they wait for validating results.Are these common thoughts and fears for many womenfacing potential genetic disorders? What supportiveinterventions might the nurse offer? Nurses need to be actively engaged with patients and their families and help them consider the facts, values, and context in which theyare making decisions. Nurses need to be open andhonest with families as they discuss these sensitive andemotional choices.Take NOTE! The nurse is in an ideal position to help families re- view what has been discussed during the genetic counsel-ing sessions and to answer any additional questions they/H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Fertilization, which takes place in the outer third of the ampulla of the fallopian tube, leads to the formationof a zygote.

When the nurse askedher additional questions about herillness, Marva reported that shehad been sick to her stomach and\"beat tired\" for days. She hadstopped eating to avoid any morenausea and vomiting. When a woman discovers that she is pregnant, she mustremember to protect andnourish the fetus by makingwise choices.11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 263264 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY regnancy is a normal life event that involves considerable physical and psychological adjustments for the mother.A pregnancy is divided into three trimesters of 13 weeks each (Arenson & Drake, 2007). Within each trimester,numerous adaptations take place that facilitate the growthof the fetus. The most obvious are physical changes toaccommodate the growing fetus. However, pregnantwomen also undergo psychological changes as they pre-pare for parenthood. Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy Traditionally, signs and symptoms of pregnancy have beengrouped into the following categories: presumptive, prob-able, and positive (Box 11.1). The only signs that can de- termine a pregnancy with 100% accuracy are positive signs. W hat additional information is necessary to complete the assessment of Marva, the 17-year-old with nausea andvomiting? What diagnostic tests might be done to conrmthe nurse's suspicion that she is pregnant? Subjective (Presumptive) Signs Presumptive signs are those signs experienced by the woman herself. The most obvious presumptive sign ofpregnancy is the absence of menstruation. Skipping aperiod is not a reliable sign of pregnancy by itself, butif it is accompanied by consistent nausea, fatigue, breasttenderness, and urinary frequency, pregnancy would seemvery likely. Presumptive changes are the least reliable indicators of pregnancy because any one of them can be caused byconditions other than pregnancy (Walsh, 2007). For ex-ample, amenorrhea can be caused by early menopause,endocrine dysfunction, malnutrition, anemia, diabetes mellitus, long-distance running, cancer, or stress. Nauseaand vomiting can be caused by gastrointestinal disorders,food poisoning, acute infections, or eating disorders.Fatigue could be caused by anemia, stress, or viral infec-tions. Breast tenderness may result from chronic cysticmastitis, premenstrual changes, or the use of oral con-traceptives. Urinary frequency could have a variety ofcauses other than pregnancy, such as infection, cystocele, structural disorders, pelvic tumors, or emotional tension(Frieden & Chan, 2007). P Consider THIS! Jim and I decided to start our family, so I stopped taking the Pill 3 months ago. One morning when I gotout of bed to take the dog out, I felt queasy and light-headed. I sure hoped I wasn't coming down with theflu. By the end of the week, I was feeling really tiredand started taking naps in the afternoon. In addition,I seemed to be going to the bathroom frequently, despitenot drinking much fluid. When my breasts started totingle and ache, I decided to make an appointmentwith my doctor to see what \"illness\" I had contracted. After listening to my list of physical complaints, the ofce nurse asked me if I might be pregnant. My eyesopened wide: I had somehow missed the link betweenmy symptoms and pregnancy. I started to think aboutwhen my last period was, and it had been 2 monthsago. The ofce ran a pregnancy test and much to mysurprise it was positive! Thoughts: Many women stop contraceptives in an attempt to achieve pregnancy but miss the early signs (continued) Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy Presumptive (Time of Occurrence) Probable (Time of Occurrence) Positive (Time of Occurrence) Braxton Hicks contractions (16-28 wk) of embryo fetus Fetal movement felt by experienced clinician (20 wk) Auscultation of fetal heart tones PM Page 264CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 265 Objective (Probable) Signs Probable signs of pregnancy are those that are apparent on physical examination by a health care professional. Com-mon probable signs of pregnancy include softening of thelower uterine segment or isthmus (Hegar's sign), soften-ing of the cervix (Goodell's sign), and a bluish-purple col-oration of the vaginal mucosa and cervix (Chadwick'ssign). Other probable signs include changes in the shapeand size of the uterus, abdominal enlargement, BraxtonHicks contractions, and ballottement (the examiner pushes against the woman's cervix during a pelvic exam- ination and feels a rebound from the floating fetus). Along with these physical signs, pregnancy tests are also considered a probable sign of pregnancy. Several preg- nancy tests are available (Table 11.1). The tests vary insensitivity, specificity, and accuracy and are influencedby the length of gestation, specimen concentration, pres-ence of blood, and the presence of some drugs (Likes &Rittenhouse, 2007). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the earli- est biochemical marker for pregnancy, and many preg-nancy tests are based on the recognition of hCG or abeta subunit of hCG. hCG levels in normal pregnancyusually double every 48 to 72 hours until they peak approx-imately 60 to 70 days after fertilization; they then decrease to a plateau at 100 to 130 days of pregnancy (Likes &Rittenhouse, 2007). Home pregnancy tests are available over the counter and have become quite popular since their introductionin 1975. These tests are very sensitive, cost-effective, andfaster than traditional laboratory pregnancy tests. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology is thebasis for most home pregnancy tests. Although probable signs suggest pregnancy and are more reliable than presumptive signs, they still are not100% reliable in confirming a pregnancy. For example,uterine tumors, polyps, infection, and pelvic congestioncan cause changes to uterine shape, size, and consistency.And although pregnancy tests are used to establish thediagnosis of pregnancy when the physical signs are stillinconclusive, they are not completely reliable, becauseconditions other than pregnancy (e.g., ovarian cancer,choriocarcinoma, hydatidiform mole) can also elevatehCG levels. Positive Signs Usually within 2 weeks after a missed period, enough sub-jective symptoms are present so that a woman can be reasonably sure she is pregnant. However, an experiencedhealth care professional can confirm her suspicions byof pregnancy. This woman was experiencing several signs of early pregnancy\u2014urinary frequency, fatigue,morning nausea, and breast tenderness.

This elevation of hCG corresponds to the morning sickness period of approximately 6 to 12 weeks during early pregnancy.Take NOTE! 11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 265266 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY identifying positive signs of pregnancy. The positive signs of pregnancy conrm that a fetus is growing in the uterus.Visualizing the fetus by ultrasound, palpating for fetalmovements, and hearing a fetal heartbeat are all signs thatmake the pregnancy a certainty. Once pregnancy is conrmed, the health care profes- sional will set up a schedule of prenatal visits to assess thewoman and her fetus throughout the entire pregnancy.Assessment and education begins at the rst visits andcontinues throughout the pregnancy (see Chapter 12). Remember Marva, who thought she had a stomach virus? Her pregnancy test was positive. On questioning by thenurse, she acknowledged missing two menstrual periods andbeing sexually active with her boyfriend without usingprotection. What is the nurse's role at this point withMarva? What instructions might be given to her while shewaits for her rst prenatal visit? Physiologic Adaptations During Pregnancy Every system of a woman's body changes during pregnancy to accommodate the needs of the growing fetus, and withstartling rapidity. The physical changes of pregnancy canbe uncomfortable, although every woman reacts uniquely. Reproductive System Adaptations Signicant changes occur throughout the woman's bodyduring pregnancy to accommodate the growing humanbeing within her. Many have a protective role for maternalhomeostasis and are essential to meet the demands of boththe mother and the fetus. Many adaptations are reversibleafter the woman gives birth, but some persist for life. Uterus During the rst few months of pregnancy, estrogen stimu-lates uterine growth, and the uterus undergoing a tremen-dous increase in size, weight, length, width, depth, volume,and overall capacity throughout pregnancy. The weight ofthe uterus increases from 70 g to about 1100 g at term;its capacity increases from 10 mL to 5000 mL or more at term (Levano, Cunningham, Alexander, et al., 2007). Theuterine walls thin to 1.5 cm or less; from a solid globe, theuterus becomes a hollow vessel. Uterine growth occurs as a result of both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the myometrial cells, which do notincrease much in number but do increase in size. Blood vessels elongate, enlarge, dilate, and sprout new branchesto support and nourish the growing muscle tissue, and theincrease in uterine weight is accompanied by a large in-crease in uterine blood flow necessary to perfuse the uter-ine muscle and accommodate the growing fetus (Frieden& Chan, 2007).Uterine contractility is enhanced as well. Spontaneous, irregular, and painless contractions, called Braxton Hicks contractions , begin during the rst trimester. These con- tractions continue throughout pregnancy, becoming espe- cially noticeable during the last month, when they function to thin out or efface the cervix before birth (see Chapter 12for more information). Changes in the uterus occurring during the first 6 to 8 weeks of gestation produce some of the typical find-ings, including a positive Hegar's sign . This softening and compressibility of the lower uterine segment resultsin exaggerated uterine anteflexion during the early monthsof pregnancy, which adds to urinary frequency (Arenson& Drake, 2007). The uterus remains in the pelvic cavity for the first 3 months of pregnancy, after which it progressively as-cends into the abdomen (Fig. 11.1). As the uterus grows,it presses on the urinary bladder and causes the increasedfrequency of urination experienced during early pregnancy.In addition, the heavy gravid uterus in the last trimestercan fall back against the inferior vena cava in the supineposition, resulting in vena cava compression, which reducesvenous return and decreases cardiac output and bloodpressure, with increasing orthostatic stress. This occurswhen the woman changes her position from recumbentto sitting to standing. This acute hemodynamic change,termed supine hypotensive syndrome, causes the woman Liver pushed up Stomach compressed Bladder compressed FIGURE11.1 The growing uterus in the abdomen.11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 266CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 267 to experience symptoms of weakness, lightheadedness, nausea, dizziness, or syncope (Fig. 11.2). These changesare reversed when the woman is in the left lateral posi-tion, which displaces the uterus to the left and off thevena cava. The uterus, which starts as a pear-shaped organ, becomes ovoid as length increases over width. By 20 weeks'gestation, the fundus, or top of the uterus, is at the levelof the umbilicus and measures 20 cm. A monthly measure-ment of the height of the top of the uterus in centimeters,which corresponds to the number of gestational weeks, iscommonly used to date the pregnancy.influence of progesterone, a thick mucus plug is formed that blocks the cervical os and protects the opening frombacterial invasion. At about the same time, increasedvascularization of the cervix causes Chadwick's sign . Cervical ripening (softening, effacement, and increaseddistensibility) begins about 4 weeks before birth. Ripeningis an inflammatory process and is not dependent on uter-ine contractions (Blackburn, 2007). Vagina During pregnancy, there is increased vascularity because of the influences of estrogen, resulting in pelvic congestionand hypertrophy of the vagina in preparation for the dis-tention needed for birth. The vaginal mucosa thickens, the connective tissue begins to loosen, the smooth mus-cle begins to hypertrophy, and the vaginal vault begins tolengthen (Frieden & Chan, 2007). Vaginal secretions become more acidic, white, and thick. Most women experience an increase in a whitishvaginal discharge, called leukorrhea, during pregnancy.This is normal except when it is accompanied by itch-ing and irritation, possibly suggesting Candida albicans, a monilial vaginitis, which is glycogen-rich environment (Mashburn, 2006).Monilial vaginitis is a benign fungal condition that is un-comfortable for the woman, but it can be transmitted froman infected mother to her newborn at birth. Neonatesdevelop an oral infection known as thrush, which pres-ents as white patches on the mucous membranes of their mouths. It is self-limiting and is treated with local anti-fungal agents. Ovaries The increased blood supply to the ovaries causes themto enlarge until approximately the 12th to 14th week ofgestation. The ovaries are not palpable after that timebecause the uterus lls the pelvic cavity. Ovulation ceasesduring pregnancy because of the elevated levels of estro-gen and progesterone, which block secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)from the anterior pituitary. The ovaries are very active inhormone production to support the pregnancy until aboutweeks 6 to 7, when the corpus luteum regresses and theplacenta takes over the major production of progesterone. Breasts The breasts increase in fullness, become tender, andgrow larger throughout pregnancy under the influence ofestrogen and progesterone. The breasts become highlyvascular, and veins become visible under the skin. Thenipples become larger and more erect. Both the nipplesand the areola become deeply pigmented, and tuberclesof Montgomery the nipples lubricated forbreastfeeding. Fundal height can be typical of gestational weeks between 18 and 32 weeks, but after 36 weeks' gestation, this measurement is no longer reliable because of the beginning of fetal highest level, at the xiphoid pro- cess, at approximately 36 weeks. Between 38 to 40 weeks, fundal height drops as the fetus begins to descend andengage into the pelvis. Because it pushes against the diaphragm, many women experience shortness of breath.By 40 weeks, the fetal head begins to descend and engagein the pelvis, which is termed lightening. For the woman who is pregnant for the rst time, lightening usually occursapproximately 2 weeks before the onset of labor; for thewoman who is experiencing her second or subsequentpregnancy, it usually occurs at the onset of labor. Although breathing becomes easier because of this descent, the pres-sure on the urinary bladder now increases and women experience urinary frequency again. Cervix Between weeks 6 and 8 of pregnancy, the cervix beginsto soften ( Goodell's sign ) due to vasocongestion. Along with the softening, the endocervical glands increase in sizeand number and produce more cervical mucus. Under the11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 267268 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Changes that occur in the connective tissue of the breasts, along with the tremendous growth, lead to striae(stretch marks) in approximately half of all pregnantwomen (Graham, 2007). Initially they appear as pink topurple lines on the skin, but they eventually fade to a silvercolor. Although they become less conspicuous in time,they never completely disappear. Creamy, yellowish breast fluid called colostrum can be expressed by the third trimester. This fluid providesnourishment for the breastfeeding newborn during thefirst few days of life (see Chapters 15 and 16 for moreinformation). Table 11.2 summarizes reproductive system adap- tations. General Body System Adaptations In addition to changes in the reproductive system, the preg-nant woman also experiences changes in virtually every other body system in response to the growing fetus. Gastrointestinal System The gastrointestinal (GI) system begins in the oral cav-ity and ends at the rectum. During pregnancy, the gumsbecome hyperemic, swollen, and friable and tend to bleed easily. This change is influenced by estrogen and increasedproliferation of blood vessels and circulation to the mouth.In addition, the saliva produced in the mouth becomesmore acidic. Some women complain about excessivesalivation, termed ptyalism, which may be caused by the decrease in unconscious swallowing by the woman whennauseated (Cunningham et al., 2005). Dental plaque,calculus, and debris deposits increase during pregnancy and are all associated with gingivitis. Recent studies havelinked periodontal disease with preterm birth and low-birthweight risk (Pretorius, Jagatt, & Lamont, 2007). Smooth muscle relaxation and decreased peristalsis occur related to the influence of progesterone. Elevatedprogesterone levels cause smooth muscle relaxation, whichresults in delayed gastric emptying and decreased peri-stalsis. Transition time of food throughout the GI tractmay be so much slower that more water than normal isreabsorbed, leading to bloating and constipation. Consti- pation can also result from low-ber food choices, reducedfluid intake, use of iron supplements, decreased activitylevel, and intestinal displacement secondary to a growinguterus. Constipation, increased venous pressure, and thepressure of the gravid uterus contribute to the formationof hemorrhoids. The slowed gastric emptying combined with relax- ation of the cardiac sphincter allows reflux, which causesheartburn. Acid indigestion or heartburn (pyrosis) seemsto be a universal problem for pregnant women. It is causedby regurgitation of the stomach contents into the upperesophagus and may be associated with the generalizedrelaxation of the entire digestive system. Over-the-counterantacids will usually relieve the symptoms, but they shouldbe taken with the health care provider's knowledge andonly as directed. The emptying time of the gallbladder is prolonged secondary to the smooth muscle relaxation from pro-gesterone. Hypercholesterolemia can follow, increasingthe risk of gallstone formation. Other risk factors for Uterus Cervix Vagina OvariesBreastsReproductive Organ Adaptations Size increases 20 times that of nonpregnant size. Capacity increases by 2,000 times to accommodate the developing fetus.Weight increases from 2 oz to approximately 2 lb at term.Uterine growth occurs as a result of both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the myometrial cells.Increased strength and elasticity allow uterus to contract and expel fetus during birth. Increases in mass, water content, and vascularization Changes from a relatively rigid to a soft, distensible structure that allows the fetus to be expelledUnder the influence of progesterone, a thick mucus plug is formed, which blocks the cervical os and protects the developing fetus from bacterial invasion. Increased vascularity because of estrogen influences, resulting in pelvic congestion and hypertrophy Increased thickness of mucosa, along with an increase in vaginal secretions to prevent bacterial infections Increased blood supply to the ovaries causes them to enlarge until approximately the 12th to 14th week of gestation, when the placenta takes over their function. Ovulation ceases during pregnancy because of the elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone. Breast changes begin soon after conception; they increase in size and areolar pigmentation. The tubercles of Montgomery enlarge and become more prominent, and the nipples more erect.The blood vessels become more prominent, and blood flow to the breast doubles.TABLE 11.2 SUMMARY OF REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM ADAPTATIONS11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 268CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 269 gallbladder disease include obesity, Hispanic ethnicity, and increasing maternal age (Ko, 2006). Nausea and vomiting, better known as morning sickness, plagues about 50% to 80% of pregnant women(Lane, 2007). Although it occurs most often in the morn- ing, the nauseated feeling can last all day in some women.The highest incidence of morning sickness is between6 and 12 weeks. The physiologic basis for morning sick-ness is still debatable. It has been linked to the high lev-els of hCG, high levels of circulating estrogens, reduced stomach acidity, and the lowered tone and motility of thedigestive tract (Lane, 2007). Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular changes occur early during pregnancy tomeet the demands of the enlarging uterus and the pla-centa for more blood and more oxygen. Perhaps the moststriking cardiac alteration occurring during pregnancy isthe increase in blood volume. Blood Volume Blood volume increases by approximately 1,500 mL, or50% above nonpregnant levels (Cunningham et al., 2005).The increase is made up of 1,000 mL plasma plus 450 mLred blood cells (RBCs). It begins at weeks 10 to 12, peaksat weeks 32 to 34, and decreases slightly at week 40.and cardiac output. The heart works harder and pumps more blood to supply the oxygen needs of the fetus as wellas those of the mother. Both heart rate and venous returnare increased in pregnancy, contributing to the increasein cardiac output seen throughout gestation. A womanwith preexisting heart disease may become symptomaticand begin to decompensate during the time the blood vol-ume peaks. Close monitoring is warranted during 28 to35 weeks' gestation. Blood Pressure Blood pressure, especially the diastolic pressure, declinesslightly during pregnancy as a result of peripheral vasodila-tion caused by progesterone. It reaches a low point at mid- pregnancy and thereafter increases to prepregnant levels until term (Blackburn, 2007). During the rst trimester,blood pressure typically remains at the prepregnancylevel. During the second trimester, the blood pressuredecreases 5 to 10 mmHg and thereafter returns to rst- trimester levels (Blackburn, 2007). Any signicant rise inblood pressure during pregnancy should be investigatedto rule out gestational hypertension. Blood Components The number of RBCs also increases throughout preg-nancy to a level 25% to 33% higher than nonpregnantvalues, depending on the amount of iron available. Thisincrease is necessary to transport the additional oxygenrequired during pregnancy. Although there is an increasein RBCs, there is a greater increase in the plasma vol-ume as a result of hormonal factors and sodium and waterretention. Because the plasma increase exceeds the increaseof RBC production, normal hemoglobin and hematocritvalues decrease. This state of hemodilution is referredto as physiologic anemia of pregnancy . Changes in RBC volume are due to increased circulating erythro-poietin and accelerated RBC production. The rise inerythropoietin in the last two trimesters is stimulated byprogesterone, prolactin, and human placental lactogen(Blackburn, 2007). Iron requirements during pregnancy increase because of the demands of the growing fetus and the increase inmaternal blood volume. The fetal tissues take predomi-nance over the mother's tissues with respect to use of ironstores. With the accelerated production of RBCs, iron isnecessary for hemoglobin formation, the oxygen-carryingcomponent of RBCs. The rise in blood volume correlates directly with fetal weight.Take NOTE! Many women enter pregnancy with insufficient iron stores and thus need supplementation to meet the extra demands of pregnancy.Take NOTE! This increase in blood volume is needed to provide adequate hydration of fetal and maternal tissues, to sup-ply blood flow to perfuse the enlarging uterus, and to pro-vide a reserve to compensate for blood loss at birth andduring postpartum (Martin & Foley, 2006). This increaseis also necessary to meet the increased metabolic needs of the mother and to meet the need for increased perfusionof other organs, especially the woman's kidneys, becauseshe is excreting waste products for herself and the fetus. Cardiac Output and Heart Rate Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heartrate. It increases from 30% to 50% over the nonpregnantrate by the 32nd week of pregnancy and declines to abouta 20% increase at 40 weeks' gestation. The increase incardiac output is associated with an increase in venous return and greater right ventricular output, especiallyin the left lateral position (Blackburn, 2007). Heart rateincreases by 10 to 15 bpm between 14 and 20 weeks ofgestation, and this persists to term. There is slight hyper-trophy or enlargement of the heart during pregnancy. This is probably to accommodate the increase in blood volume11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 269270 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Both brin and plasma brinogen levels increase, along with various blood-clotting factors. These factorsmake pregnancy a hypercoagulable state. These changes,coupled with venous stasis secondary to venous pooling,which occurs during late pregnancy after long periods ofstanding in the upright position with the pressure exertedby the uterus on the large pelvic veins, contribute to slowedvenous return, pooling, and dependent edema. These fac-tors also increase the woman's risk for venous thrombosis (Martin & Foley, 2006). Respiratory System The growing uterus and the increased production of thehormone progesterone cause the lungs to function dif-ferently during pregnancy. During the pregnancy, theamount of space available to house the lungs decreasesas the uterus puts pressure on the diaphragm and causesit to shift upward by 4 cm above its usual position. Thegrowing uterus does change the size and shape of the tho-racic cavity, but diaphragmatic excursion increases, chestcircumference increases by 2 to 3 in, and the transversediameter increases by an inch, allowing a larger tidal vol-ume, as evidenced by deeper breathing (Blackburn, 2007). Tidal volume or the volume of air inhaled increases grad-ually by 30 to 40% (from 500 to 700 mL) as the p regnancy progresses. As a result of these changes, the women'sbreathing becomes more diaphragmatic than abdominal(Torgersen & Curran, 2006). A pregnant woman breathes faster and more deeply because she and the fetus need more oxygen. Oxygen con-sumption increases during pregnancy as airway resistance and lung compliance remain unchanged. Changes inthe structures of the respiratory system take place toprepare the body for the enlarging uterus and increasedlung volume (Alexander et al., 2007). As muscles andcartilage in the thoracic region relax, the chest broadens,with a conversion from abdominal breathing to thoracicbreathing. This leads to a 50% increase in air volume perminute. All these structural alterations are temporaryand revert back to their prepregnant state at the end ofthe pregnancy. Increased vascularity of the respiratory tract is influ- enced by increased estrogen levels, leading to congestion.This congestion gives rise to nasal and sinus stufness,epistaxis (nosebleed), and changes in the tone and qual-ity of the woman's voice (Martin & Foley, 2006). Renal/Urinary System The renal system must handle the effects of increasedmaternal intravascular and extracellular volume and meta-bolic waste products as well as excretion of fetal wastes. The predominant structural change in the renal systemduring pregnancy is dilation of the renal pelvis and uterus.Changes in renal structure occur from hormonal influ- ences of estrogen and progesterone, pressure from an en-larging uterus, and an increase in maternal blood volume.Like the heart, the kidneys work harder throughout the pregnancy. Changes in kidney function occur to accom- modate a heavier workload while maintaining a stable elec-trolyte balance and blood pressure. As more blood flows to the kidneys, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in-creases, leading to an increase in urine flow and volume,substances delivered to the kidneys, and ltration and ex-cretion of water and solutes (Jeyabalan & Lain, 2007). Anatomically, the kidneys enlarge during pregnancy. Each kidney increases in length and weight as a result ofhormonal effects that cause increased tone and decreasedmotility of the smooth muscle. The renal pelvis becomesdilated. The ureters (especially the right ureter) elongate,widen, and become more curved above the pelvic rimas early as the 10th gestational week (Jeyabalan & Lain, 2007). Progesterone is thought to cause both these changesbecause of its relaxing influence on smooth muscle. Blood flow to the kidneys increases by 50% to 80% as a result of the increase in cardiac output. This in turnleads to an increase in the GFR by as much as 40% to60% starting during the second trimester. This elevationcontinues until birth (Blackburn, 2007). The activity of the kidneys normally increases when a person lies down and decreases on standing. This differ-ence is amplied during pregnancy, which is one reason apregnant woman feels the need to urinate frequently whiletrying to sleep. Late in the pregnancy, the increase in kid-ney activity is even greater when the woman lies on herside rather than her back. Lying on the side relieves thepressure that the enlarged uterus puts on the vena cavacarrying blood from the legs. Subsequently, venous re-turn to the heart increases, leading to increased cardiacoutput. Increased cardiac output results in increasedrenal perfusion and glomerular filtration (Fitzgerald &Graziano, 2007). Musculoskeletal System Changes in the musculoskeletal system are progressive,resulting from the influence of hormones, fetal growth,and maternal weight gain. Pregnancy is characterized bychanges in posture and gait. By the 10th to 12th week ofpregnancy, the ligaments that hold the sacroiliac joints andthe pubis symphysis in place begin to soften and stretch,and the articulations between the joints widen and becomemore movable (Frieden & Chan, 2007). The relaxation ofthe joints peaks by the beginning of the third trimester.The purpose of these changes is to increase the size of thepelvic cavity and to make delivery easier. The postural changes of pregnancy\u2014an increased swayback and an upper spine extension to compensatefor the enlarging abdomen\u2014coupled with the looseningof the sacroiliac joints may result in lower back pain. Thewoman's center of gravity shifts forward, requiring a re-alignment of the spinal curvatures. An increase in thenormal lumbosacral curve (lordosis) occurs area develops11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 270CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 271 to assist her in maintaining her balance (Fig. 11.3). In ad- dition, relaxation and increased mobility of joints occurbecause of the hormones proge sterone and relaxin , which lead to the characteristic \"waddle gait\" that pregnantwomen demonstrate toward term. Increased weight gaincan add to this discomfort by accentuating the lumbar anddorsal curves (Torgersen & Curran, 2006). Integumentary System The skin of pregnant women undergoes hyperpigmenta- tion primarily as a result of estrogen, progesterone, andmelanocyte-stimulating hormone levels. These changesare mainly seen on umbilicus, per-ineum, and axilla. Although many integumentary changesdisappear after giving birth, some only fade. Many preg-nant women express concern about stretch marks, skincolor changes, and hair loss. Unfortunately, little is knownabout how to avoid these changes. Complexion changes are not unusual. The increased pigmentation that occurs on the breasts and genitalia alsodevelops on the face to form the \"mask of pregnancy,\" orfacial melasma. It occurs in up to 70% of pregnant women.There is a genetic predisposition toward melasma, which is exacerbated by the sun; it tends to recur in subsequentpregnancies. This blotchy, brownish pigment covers theforehead and cheeks in dark-haired women. Most fade asthe hormones subside at the end of the pregnancy, butsome may linger. The skin in the middle of the abdomenmay develop a pigmented line called linea nigra , which extends from the umbilicus to the pubic area (Fig. 11.4). Striae gravidarum, or stretch marks, are irregular reddish streaks that appear on the abdomen, breasts, andbuttocks in about half of pregnant women. Striae are A. Early pregnancy B. Late pregnancyFIGURE11.3 Postural changes during ( A) the rst trimester and ( B) the third trimester. FIGURE11.4 Linea nigra.most prominent by 6 to 7 months. They result from re- duced connective tissue strength resulting from the ele-vated adrenal steroid levels and stretching of the structuressecondary to growth (Tunzi & Gray, 2007). They aremore common in younger women, women with larger in-fants, and women with higher body mass indices. Non-whites and women with a history of breast or thigh striaeor a family history of striae gravidarum also are at higherrisk (Osman et al., 2007).11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 271272 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Vascular changes during pregnancy manifested in the integumentary system include varicosities of the legs,vulva, and perineum. Varicose veins commonly are theresult of distention, instability, and poor circulation sec- ondary to prolonged standing or sitting and the heavygravid uterus placing pressure on the pelvic veins, pre- venting complete venous return. Interventions to reducethe risk of developing varicosities include: Elevating both legs when sitting or lying down Avoiding prolonged standing or sitting; changing posi- tion frequently Resting in the left lateral position Walking daily for exercise Avoiding tight clothing or knee-high hosiery Wearing support hose if varicosities are a preexisting condition to pregnancy Another skin manifestation, believed to be secondary to vascular changes and high estrogen levels, is the appear-ance of small blood vessels called vascular spiders. They may appear on the neck, thorax, face, and arms. Theyare especially obvious in white women and typically dis-appear after childbirth (Tunzi & Gray, 2007). Palmarerythema is a well-delineated pinkish area on the palmarsurface of the hands. This integumentary change is alsorelated to elevated estrogen levels (Tunzi & Gray, 2007). Some women also notice a decline in hair growth during pregnancy. The hair follicles normally undergo agrowing and resting phase. The resting phase is followedby a loss of hair; the hairs are then replaced by new ones.During pregnancy, fewer hair follicles go into the rest-ing phase. After delivery, the body catches up with sub-sequent hair loss for several months. Nails typically grow faster during pregnancy. Pregnant women may experienceincreased brittleness and transverse grooves on the nails,but most of these conditions resolve in the postpartumperiod (Tunzi & Gray, 2007). Endocrine System The endocrine system undergoes many changes duringpregnancy because hormonal changes are essential in meet-ing the needs of the growing fetus. Hormonal changes playa major role in controlling the supplies of maternal glu- cose, amino acids, and lipids to the fetus. Although es-trogen and progesterone are the main hormones involved in pregnancy changes, other endocrine glands and hor-mones also change during pregnancy. Thyroid Gland The thyroid gland enlarges slightly and becomes moreactive during pregnancy as a result of increased vascular-ity and hyperplasia. Increased gland activity results in anincrease in thyroid hormone secretion starting during therst trimester; levels taper off within a few weeks after birthand return to normal limits (Poppe, Velkeniers, & Glinoer,2007). With an increase in the secretion of thyroid hor-mones, the basal metabolic rate (BMR; the amount of oxy- gen consumed by the body over a unit of time in millilitersper minute) progressively increases by 25%, along withheart rate and cardiac output (Blackburn, 2007). Pituitary Gland The pituitary gland, also known as the hypophysis, is asmall, oval gland about the size of a pea that is connectedto the hypothalamus by a stalk called the infundibulum.During pregnancy, the pituitary gland enlarges; it returnsto normal size after birth. The anterior lobe of the pituitary is glandular tissue and produces multiple hormones. The release of thesehormones is regulated by releasing and inhibiting hor-mones produced by the hypothalamus. Some of theseanterior pituitary hormones induce other glands to se- crete their hormones. The increase in blood levels of thehormones produced by the nal target glands (e.g., theovary or thyroid) inhibits the release of anterior pituitaryhormones. Changes in levels of pituitary hormones arediscussed in the following paragraphs. FSH and LH secretion are inhibited during preg- nancy, probably as a result of hCG produced by the pla-centa and corpus luteum, and the increased secretion ofprolactin by the anterior pituitary gland. Levels remaindecreased until after delivery. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is reduced dur- ing the rst trimester but usually returns to normal for theremainder of the pregnancy. Decreased TSH is thoughtto be one of the factors, along with elevated hCG levels,associated with morning sickness, nausea, and vomitingduring the rst trimester. Growth hormone (GH) is an anabolic hormone that promotes protein synthesis. It stimulates most body cellsto grow in size and divide, facilitating the use of fats forfuel and conserving glucose. During pregnancy, there isa decrease in the number of GH-producing cells and acorresponding decrease in GH blood levels. The actionof human placental lactogen (hPL) is thought to decreasethe need for and use of GH. During pregnancy, prolactin is secreted in pulses and increases ten-fold to promote breast developmentand the lactation process. High levels of progesteronesecreted by the placenta inhibit the direct influence ofprolactin on the breast during pregnancy, thus suppress-ing lactation. At birth, as soon as the placenta is expelledand there is a drop in progesterone, lactogenesis can begin(Cunningham et al., 2005). Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), another anterior pituitary hormone, increases during pregnancy.For many years, its increase was thought to be respon-sible for many of the skin changes of pregnancy, particu- larly changes in skin pigmentation (e.g., darkening of theareola, melasma, and linea nigra). However, currently itis thought that the skin changes are due to estrogen (andpossibly progesterone) as well as the increase in MSH.11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 272CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 273 The two hormones oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) released by the posterior pituitary are actually syn-thesized in the hypothalamus. They migrate along nerve bers to the posterior pituitary and are stored until stim-ulated to be released into the general circulation. Oxytocin is released by the posterior pituitary gland, and its production gradually increases as the fetus ma-tures (Ochedalski et al., 2007). Oxytocin is responsiblefor uterine contractions, both before and after delivery.The muscle layers of the uterus (myometrium) becomemore sensitive to oxytocin near term. Toward the end ofa term pregnancy, levels of progesterone decline and con-tractions that were previously suppressed by progesterone begin to occur more frequently and with stronger inten-sity. This change in the hormonal levels is believed to beone of the initiators of labor. Oxytocin is responsible for stimulating the uterine contractions that bring about delivery. Contractionslead to cervical thinning and dilation. They also exert pres-sure, helping the fetus to descend in the pelvis for even- tual delivery. After delivery, oxytocin secretion continues,causing the myometrium to contract and helping to con-strict the uterine blood vessels, decreasing the amount ofvaginal bleeding after delivery. Oxytocin is also responsible for milk ejection during breastfeeding. Stimulation of the breasts through suckingor touching oxytocin is being released. Vasopressin (ADH) functions to inhibit or prevent the formation of urine via vasoconstriction, which resultsin increased blood pressure. Vasopressin also exhibits anantidiuretic effect and plays an important role in the reg-ulation of water balance (Fitzgerald & Graziano, 2007). Pancreas The pancreas is an exocrine organ, supplying digestiveenzymes and buffers, and an endocrine organ. The en-docrine pancreas consists of the islets of Langerhans,which are groups of cells scattered throughout, each con-taining four cell types. One of the cell types is the betacell, which produces insulin. Insulin lowers blood glucoseby increasing the rate of glucose uptake and utilizationby most body cells. The growing fetus needs signi cant amounts of glucose, amino acids, and lipids. Even duringearly pregnancy the fetus makes demands on the maternalglucose stores. Ideally, hormonal changes of pregnancyhelp meet fetal needs without putting the mother's metab- olism out of balance. A woman's insulin secretion works on a \"supply- versus-demand\" mode. As the demand to meet the needs of pregnancy increases, more insulin is secreted. Mater-nal insulin does not cross the placenta, so the fetus mustproduce his or her own supply to maintain glucose con-trol (Box 11.2 gives information about pregnancy, glu- cose, and insulin). During the rst half of pregnancy, much of the mater- nal glucose is diverted to the growing fetus, and thus themother's glucose levels are low. hPL and other hormonalantagonists increase during the second half of pregnancy.Therefore, the mother must produce more insulin to over-come the resistance by these hormones. If the mother has normal beta cells of the islets of Langerhans, there is usually no problem meeting thedemands for extra insulin. However, if the woman hasinadequate numbers of beta cells, she may be unable toproduce enough insulin and will develop glucose intoler-ance during pregnancy. If the woman has glucose intol-erance, she is not able to meet the increasing demandsand her blood glucose level increases. Adrenal Glands Pregnancy does not cause much change in the size ofthe adrenal glands themselves, but there are changes insome secretions and activity. One of the key changes isthe marked increase in cortisol secretion, which regu- lates carbohydrate and protein metabolism and is helpfulBOX 11.2 Pregnancy, Insulin, and Glucose During early pregnancy, there is a decrease in maternal glucose levels because of the heavy fetal demand forglucose. The fetus is also drawing amino acids and lipidsfrom the mother, decreasing the mother's ability tosynthesize glucose. Maternal glucose is diverted acrossthe placenta to assist the growing embryo/fetus duringearly pregnancy, and thus levels decline in the mother.As a result, maternal glucose concentrations decline to a level that would be considered \"hypoglycemic\" ina nonpregnant woman. During early pregnancy thereis also a decrease in maternal insulin production andinsulin levels. The pancreas is responsible for the production of insulin, which facilitates entry of glucose into cells. Although glucose and other nutrients easily cross theplacenta to the fetus, insulin does not. Therefore, thefetus must produce its own insulin to facilitate theentry of glucose into its own cells. After the rst trimester, hPL from the placenta and steroids (cortisol) from the adrenal cortex act againstinsulin. hPL acts as an antagonist against maternal insulin, and thus more insulin must be secreted tocounteract the increasing levels of hPL and cortisolduring the last half of pregnancy. Prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone are also thought to oppose insulin. As a result, glucose is less likely toenter the mother's cells and is more likely to cross overthe placenta to the fetus (Cunningham et al., 2005).11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 273274 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY in times of stress. Although pregnancy is considered a nor- mal condition, it is a time of stress for a woman's body. Cortisol increases in response to increased estrogen levelsthroughout pregnancy and returns to normal levels within6 weeks postpartum (Blackburn, 2007). During the stress of pregnancy, cortisol: Helps keep up the level of glucose in the plasma by breaking down noncarbohydrate sources, such as aminoand fatty acids, to make glycogen. Glycogen, stored inthe liver, is easily broken down to glucose when neededso that glucose is available in times of stress. Breaks down proteins to repair tissues and manufacture enzymes Has anti-insulin, anti-inflammatory, and antiallergic actions Is needed to make the precursors of adrenaline, which the adrenal medulla produces and secretes(Cunningham et al., 2005) Aldosterone, also secreted by the adrenal glands, is increased during pregnancy. It normally regulates absorp-tion of sodium from the distal tubules of the kidney. Dur-ing pregnancy, progesterone allows salt to be \"wasted\" (orlost) in the urine. Aldosterone is produced in increasedamounts by the adrenal glands as early as 15 weeks of preg-nancy (Jeyabalan & Lain, 2007). Prostaglandin Secretion During Pregnancy Prostaglandins are not protein or steroid hormones; theyare chemical mediators, or \"local\" hormones. Although hormones circulate in the blood to influence distant tissues,prostaglandins act locally on adjacent cells. The fetal mem-branes of the amniotic sac\u2014the amnion and chorion\u2014 are both believed to be involved in the production ofprostaglandins. Various maternal and fetal tissues, as wellas the amniotic fluid itself, are considered to be sourcesof prostaglandins, but details about their composition andsources are limited. It is widely believed that prostaglandinsplay a part in softening the cervix and initiating and/ormaintaining labor, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Placental Secretion The placenta has a feature possessed by no other endocrineorgan\u2014the ability to form protein and steroid hormones.Very early during pregnancy, the placenta begins to pro-duce the hormones: hCG hPL Relaxin Progesterone Estrogen Table 11.3 summarizes the role of these hormones. Immune System The immune system is made up of organs and special- ized cells whose primary purpose is to defend the bodyfrom foreign substances (antigens) that may cause tissue injury or disease. The mechanisms of innate and adaptiveimmunity work cooperatively to prevent, control, anderadicate foreign antigens in the body. A general enhancement of innate immunity (inflam- matory response and phagocytosis) and suppression ofadaptive immunity (protective response to a specic for- eign antigen) takes place during pregnancy. These im-munologic alterations help prevent the mother's immunesystem from rejecting the fetus (foreign body), increaseher risk of developing certain infections such as urinarytract infections, and influence the course of chronic dis-orders such as autoimmune diseases. Some chronic con- ditions worsen (diabetes) while others seem to stabilize (asthma) during pregnancy, but this is individualizedand not predictable. In general, immune function in preg-nant women is similar to immune function in nonpreg- nant women.

Outline the bodily changesMarva can expect each trimester to help her understandthe adaptations taking place. What guidance can the nurse give Marva to help her understand the changes of pregnancy? Table 11.4 summarizes the general body systems adap- tations to pregnancy. Changing Nutritional Needs of Pregnancy Healthy eating during pregnancy enables optimal ges- tational weight gain and reduces complications, both ofwhich are associated with positive birth outcomes. Dur-ing pregnancy, maternal nutritional needs change to meetthe demands of the pregnancy. Healthy eating can help en-surethat adequate nutrients are available for both mother and fetus. Nutritional intake during pregnancy has a direct ef- fect on fetal well-being and birth outcome. Inadequatenutritional intake, for example, is associated with pretermbirth, low birthweight, and congenital anomalies. Ex-cessive nutritional intake is connected with fetal macro-somia ( >4,000 g), leading to a difficult birth, neonatal hypoglycemia, and continued obesity in the mother(Blackburn, 2007). Since the requirements for so many nutrients increase during pregnancy, pregnant women should take a vitaminand mineral supplement daily. Prenatal vitamins are pre-scribed routinely as a safeguard against a less-than-optimaldiet. In particular, iron and folic acid need to be supple-mented because their increased requirements during preg- nancy are usually too great to be met through diet alone11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 274CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 275 (Blackburn, 2007). Iron and folic acid are needed to form new blood cells for the expanded maternal blood volumeand to prevent anemia. Folic acid is essential before preg-nancy and in the early weeks of pregnancy to prevent neu-ral tube defects in the fetus. For most pregnant women,supplements of 30 mg of ferrous iron and 600 mcg of folicacid per day are recommended by the dietary reference intakes Women history of a fetus with a neural tube defect are often prescribed a higher dose. There is an abundance of conflicting advice about nutrition during pregnancy and what is good or bad toeat. Overall, the following guidelines are helpful: Increase your consumption of fruits and vegetables. Replace saturated fats with unsaturated ones. Avoid hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats. Use reduced-fat spreads and dairy products instead of full-fat ones. Eat at least two servings of sh weekly, with one of them being an oily sh. Consume at least 2 quarts of water daily (Arenson & Drake, 2007). In the months before conception, food choices are key. The foods and vitamins consumed can ensure thatthe woman and her fetus will have the nutrients that areessential for the very start of pregnancy. While most women recognize the importance of healthy eating during pregnancy, some find it challeng-ing to achieve. Many women say they have little timeand energy to devote to meal planning and preparation. Another barrier to healthy eating is conflicting messagesfrom various sources, resulting in a lack of clear, reli-able, and relevant information. Moreover, many womenhCG hPL (also known as human chorionic somatomammotropin[hCS]) Relaxin Progesterone EstrogenHormone Description Responsible for maintaining the maternal corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone and estrogens, with synthesis occurring before implantation Production by fetal trophoblast cells until the placenta is developed sufciently to take over that function Basis for early pregnancy tests because it appears in the maternal bloodstream soon after implantation Production peaks at 8 weeks and then gradually declines. Preparation of mammary glands for lactation and involved in the process of making glucose available for fetal growth by altering maternal carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism Antagonist of insulin because it decreases tissue sensitivity or alters the ability to use insulin Increase in the amount of circulating free fatty acids for maternal metabolic needs and decrease in maternal metabolism of glucose to facilitate fetal growth Secretion by the placenta as well as the corpus luteum during pregnancy Thought to act synergistically with progesterone to maintain pregnancy Increase in flexibility of the pubic symphysis, permitting the pelvis to expand during delivery Dilation of the cervix, making it easier for the fetus to enter the vaginal canal; thought to suppress the release of oxytocin by the hypothalamus, thus delaying the onset of labor contractions (Blackburn, 2007) Often called the \"hormone of pregnancy\" because of the critical role it plays in supporting the endometrium of the uterus Supports the endometrium to provide an environment conducive to fetal survival Produced by the corpus luteum during the rst few weeks of pregnancy and then by the placenta until term Initially, causes thickening of the uterine lining in anticipation of implantation of the fertilized ovum. From then on, it maintains the endometrium, inhibits uterine contractility, and assistsin the development of the breasts for lactation (Graham, 2007). Promotes enlargement of the genitals, uterus, and breasts, and increases vascularity, causing vasodilatation. Relaxation of pelvic ligaments and joints (Blackburn, 2007) Associated with hyperpigmentation, vascular changes in the skin, increased activity of the salivary glands, and hyperemia of the gums and nasal (Tunzi &Gray, 2007) Aids in developing the ductal system of the breasts in preparation for lactation (Graham, 2007)TABLE 11.3 PLACENTAL HORMONES11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 275276 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Gastrointestinal system Cardiovascular system Respiratory system Renal/Urinary system Musculoskeletal system Integumentary system Endocrine system Immune systemSystem Mouth and pharynx: Gums become hyperemic, swollen, and friable and tend to bleed easily. Saliva production increases. Esophagus: Decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and tone, which increases the risk of developing heartburn Stomach: Decreased tone and mobility with delayed gastric emptying time, which increases the risk of gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting. Decreased gastric acidity and histamine output,which improves symptoms of peptic ulcer disease. Intestines: Decreased intestinal tone motility with increased transit time, which increases risk of constipation and flatulence Gallbladder: Decreased tone and motility, which may increase risk of gallstone formation Blood volume: Marked increase in plasma (50%) and RBCs (25% to 33%) compared to nonpregnant values. Causes hemodilution, which is reflected in a lower hematocrit and hemoglobin. Cardiac output and heart rate: CO increases from 30% to 50% over the nonpregnant rate by the 32nd week of pregnancy. The increase in CO is associated with an increase in venous return and greater right ventricular output, especially in the left lateral position. Heart rate increases by10 to 15 bpm between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation, and this increase persists to term. Blood pressure: Diastolic pressure decreases typically 10 to 15 mmHg to reach its lowest point by mid-pregnancy; it then gradually returns to nonpregnant baseline values by term. Blood components: The number of RBCs increases throughout pregnancy to a level 25% to 33% higher than nonpregnant values. Both brin and plasma brinogen levels increase, along with various blood-clotting factors. These factors make pregnancy a hypercoagulable state. Enlargement of the uterus shifts the diaphragm up to 4 cm above its usual position. As muscles and cartilage in the thoracic region relax, the chest broadens, with conversion from ab dominal breathing to thoracic breathing. This leads to a 50% increase in air volume per minute. Tidal volume, or the volume of air inhaled, increases gradually by 30% to 40% (from 500 to 700 mL) as the pregnancy progresses. The renal pelvis becomes dilated. The ureters (especially the right ureter) elongate, widen, and become more curved above the pelvic rim. Bladder tone decreases and bladder capacity doubles by term.GFR increases 40% to 60% during pregnancy.Blood flow to the kidneys increases by 50% to 80% as a result of the increase in cardiac output. Distention of the abdomen with growth of the fetus tilts the pelvis forward, shifting the center of gravity. The woman compensates by developing an increased curvature (lordosis) of the spine. Relaxation and increased mobility of joints occur because of the hormones progesterone and relaxin, which lead to the characteristic \"waddle gait\" that pregnant women demonstrate toward term. Hyperpigmentation of the skin is the most common alteration during pregnancy. The most common areas include the areola, genital skin, axilla, inner aspects of the thighs, and linea nigra. Striae gravidarum, or stretch marks, are irregular reddish streaks that may appear on the abdomen, breasts, and buttocks in about half of pregnant women. The skin in the middle of the abdomen may develop a pigmented line called linea nigra, which extends from the umbilicus to the pubic Melasma (\"mask of pregnancy\") occurs in 45% to 70% of pregnant women. It is characterized by irregular, blotchy areas of pigmentation on the face, most commonly on the cheeks, chin,and nose. Controls the integrity and duration of gestation by maintaining the corpus luteum via hCG secretion; production of estrogen, progesterone, hPL, and other hormones and growth factors via the placenta; release of oxytocin (by the posterior pituitary gland), the and relaxin (by the ovary, uterus, and placenta). A general enhancement of innate immunity (inflammatory response and phagocytosis) and suppression of adaptive immunity (protective response to a specic foreign antigen) takes placeduring pregnancy. These immunologic alterations help prevent the mother's immune systemfrom rejecting the fetus (foreign body), increase her risk of developing certain infections, and influence the course of chronic disorders such as autoimmune diseases.TABLE 11.4 SUMMARY OF GENERAL BODYSYSTEM ADAPTATIONS11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 276CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 277 are eating less in an effort to control their weight, putting them at greater risk of inadequate nutrient intake. Nutritional Requirements During Pregnancy Pregnancy is one of the most nutritionally demanding periods of a woman's life. Gestation involves rapid celldivision and organ development, and an adequate sup-ply of nutrients is essential to support this tremendousfetal growth. Most women are usually motivated to eat properly during pregnancy for the sake of the fetus. The Food andNutrition Board of the National Research Council hasmade recommendations for nutrient intakes for peopleliving in the United States. The DRIs are more compre-hensive than previous nutrient guidelines issued by the board. They have replaced previous recommendationsbecause they are not limited to preventing deciency dis-eases; rather, the DRIs incorporate current concepts about the role of nutrients and food components in reducingthe risk of chronic disease, developmental disorders, and other related problems. The DRIs can be used to plan andassess diets for healthy people (Dudek, 2006). These dietary recommendations also include infor- mation for women who are pregnant or lactating, becausegrowing fetal and maternal tissues require increased quan-tities of essential dietary components. For example, the current DRIs suggest an increase in the pregnant woman'sintake of protein from 60 to 80 g per day, iron from 18to 27 g per day, and folate from 400 to 600 mcg per day,along with an increase of 300 calories per day over therecommended intake of 1,800 to 2,200 calories for non-pregnant women (IOM, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c, 2006d,2006e, 2006f) (Table 11.5). For a pregnant woman to meet recommended DRIs, it is important for her to eat according to the USDA's FoodGuide Pyramid (Fig. 11.5). The 2005 Dietary Guidelinesfor Americans are the basis for federal nutrition policy.The Food Guide Pyramid provides guidance to help im-plement these guidelines. A summary of the new guide-lines is as follows: Eat a variety of food from all food groups using portion control. Increase intake of vitamins, minerals, and dietary ber. Lower intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol. Consume adequate synthetic folic acid from supple- ments or from fortified foods. Increase intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Balance calorie intake with exercise to maintain ideal healthy weight (USDA, 2005). An eating plan that follows the pyramid should pro- vide sufficient nutrients for a healthy pregnancy.

However, a vitamin and mineral supplement is generally prescribed. Fish and shellsh are an important part of a healthy diet because they contain high-quality protein, are low insaturated fat, and contain omega-3 fatty acids. However, nearly all sh and shellsh contain traces of mercury andsome contain higher levels of mercury that may harm adeveloping fetus if ingested by pregnant women in largeamounts. With this in mind, the FDA and the Environ-mental Protection Agency (EPA) are advising womenwho may become pregnant, pregnant women, and nurs-ing mothers to do the following: Avoid eating shark, swordsh, king mackerel, and tilesh. Eat up to 12 ounces (two average meals) weekly of these fish: Shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon Pollock and catsh Check local advisories about the safety of sh caught by family and friends in local lakes, rivers, and coastalareas (Hibbeln et al., 2007)Food Group 1st Trimester 2nd and 3rd TrimestersWhat counts as 1 cup or 1 ounce?

A woman canlose extra weight after a pregnancy, but she can nevermake up for a poor nutritional status during the preg-nancy. Currently, the American College of Obstetricians& Gynecologists (2005) recommends a 25- to 35-poundweight gain during pregnancy. Table 11.6 summarizes thedistribution of weight gain during pregnancy. The best way to assess whether a pregnant woman is consuming enough calories is to follow her pattern ofweight gain. If she is gaining in a steady, gradual manner,then she is taking in enough calories. However, consum-ing an adequate amount of calories doesn't guarantee thather nutrients are sufcient. It is critical to evaluate boththe quantity and the quality of the foods eaten. The IOM has issued recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy based on prepregnancy body massindex (BMI; Box 11.3). A woman who is underweightbefore pregnancy or who has a low maternal weight gainpattern should be monitored carefully because she is atrisk of giving birth to a low-birthweight infant ( <2,500 g or 5.5 pounds). Frequently these women simply need ad-vice on what to eat to add weight. Encourage the womanto eat snacks that are high in calories such as nuts, peanut Fetus 7.5-8.5 pounds Blood 4 poundsUterus 2 poundsBreasts 1 poundPlacenta and umbilical cord 1.5 poundsFat and protein stores 7.5 poundsTissue fluids 2.7 poundsAmniotic fluid 1.8 poundsApproximate total weight gain 29 poundsComponent WeightTABLE 11.6 NORMAL P. (2007). Zinc supplementation for improving pregnancy and infant outcome. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD000230. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub3.Study It has been suggested that low serum zinc levels may be associated with suboptimal outcomes of pregnancysuch as prolonged labor, atonic postpartum hemorrhage,pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm labor, andpost-term pregnancies, although many of these associationshave not yet been established. Many women of childbearing age may have mild to moderate zinc deficiency. Low zinc levels may causepreterm birth or may prolong labor. It is also possiblethat zinc deficiency may affect infant growth. A review of 17 trials, involving over 9,000 women and their babies, found that although zinc supplementationhas a small effect on reducing preterm births, it does nothelp to prevent low-birthweight babies. Finding ways toimprove women's overall nutritional status, particularly inlow-income areas, will do more to improve the health ofmothers and babies than giving pregnant women zincsupplements.Findings The 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily in the group of studiesinvolving women of low income, and this has some relevancein areas of high perinatal mortality. There was no convincingevidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy resultsin other important benets. Since the preterm associationcould well reflect poor nutrition, studies to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of populations inimpoverished areas, rather than focusing on micronutrientand/or zinc supplementation in isolation, should be a priority. Nursing Implications Nurses can dispel any myths associated with the use ofzinc as a preventive measure for preterm births, since re-search doesn't seem to validate this. Encouraging betternutrition, increasing water consumption, and taking restperiods throughout the day are all associated withlongevity of pregnancy. At this point, the exact triggeringmechanism for preterm labor is not known. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 11.1 Effects of Zinc Supplementation in Pregnancy on Maternal, Fetal, Neonatal, and Infant Outcomes butter, milkshakes, cheese, fruit, yogurt, and ice cream. Any woman who has a prepregnancy BMI of less than19.8 is considered to be high risk and should be referredto a nutritionist. These women are encouraged to gain 28to 40 pounds during the pregnancy (IOM, 2006a). Conversely, women who start a pregnancy while overweight (BMI >25 to 29) run the risk of having a high-11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 279280 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY gain should be about 1 pound per week. For underweight women, weight gain should be slightly more than 1 poundper week. For overweight women, weight gain should beabout two thirds of a pound per week (Blackburn, 2007). Nutrition Promotion Through education, nurses can play an important role in ensuring adequate nutrition for pregnant women. Duringthe initial prenatal visit, health care providers conducta thorough assessment of a woman's typical dietary prac-tices and address any conditions that may cause inade- quate nutrition, such as nausea and vomiting or lack of access to adequate food. Assess and reinforce dietary infor-mation at every prenatal visit to promote good nutrition. A normal pregnancy and a well-balanced diet generallyprovide most of the recommended nutrients except ironand folate, both of which must be supplemented in theform of prenatal vitamins. The Food Guide Pyramid, developed in 1992 and re- vised in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is thetypical tool used for nutritional education and is recognizedby the general population as the gold standard for healthyeating patterns (Dudek, 2006). Use this well-known toolas a basis for dietary instruction and tailor it to meet eachwoman's individual needs (Teaching Guidelines 11.1). Special Nutritional Considerations Many factors play an important role in shaping a person's food habits, and these factors must be taken into accountbirthweight infant, with resulting cephalopelvic dispro- portion and, potentially, a surgical birth. Dieting duringpregnancy is never recommended, even for women whoare obese. Severe restriction of caloric intake is associatedwith a decrease in birthweight. Because of the expansionof maternal blood volume and the development of fetaland placental tissues, some weight gain is essential fora healthy pregnancy. Women who gain more than therecommended weight during pregnancy and who fail tolose this weight 6 months after giving birth are at muchhigher risk of being obese nearly a decade later (ACOG,2005). Women who are overweight when beginning a preg-nancy should gain no more than 15 to 25 pounds during the pregnancy, depending on their nutritional status anddegree of obesity (ACOG, 2005). All pregnant women should aim for a steady rate of weight gain throughout pregnancy. During the firsttrimester, for women whose prepregnant weight is within the normal weight range, weight gain should be about3.5 to 5 pounds. For underweight women, weight gainshould be at least 5 pounds. For overweight women,weight gain should be about 2 pounds. Much of the weight gained during the first trimester is caused by growth ofthe uterus and expansion of the blood volume. During the second and third trimesters, the following pattern is recommended. For women whose prepreg-nant weight is within the normal weight range, weightTEACHING GUIDELINES 11.1 Teaching to Promote Optimal Nutrition During Pregnancy Follow the Food Guide Pyramid and select a variety of foods from each group. Gain weight in a gradual and steady manner as follows:a. Normal-weight woman\u201425 to 35 poundsb. prenatal vitamin/mineral supplementationdaily. Avoid weight-reduction diets during pregnancy. Do not skip meals; eat three meals with one or twosnacks daily. Limit the intake of sodas and caffeine-rich drinks. Avoid the use of diuretics during pregnancy. Do not restrict the use of salt unless instructed todo so by your health care provider. Engage in reasonable physical activity daily.BOX 11.3 Body Mass Index Body Mass Index (BMI) provides an accurate estimate of total body fat and is considered a good method to assess overweight and obesity in people. BMI is a weight-to-height ratio calculation that can be determined by dividing a woman's weight in kilograms by her height inmeters squared. BMI can also be calculated by weightin pounds divided by the height in inches squared, multiplied by 704.5.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) categorizes BMI as follows: Underweight: less than 18.5 Healthy weight: 18.5 to 24.9 Overweight: 25 to 29.9 Obese: 30 or higher (CDC, 2007)Use this example to calculate BMI:Mary is 5-foot-5 tall and weighs 150 pounds.1. Convert weight into kilograms 150 divided by 2.2 lb/kg =68.18 kg. 2. Convert height into meters: a. 5-foot-5 inches times 2.54 cm/in =165.1 cm b. 165.1 cm/100 cm =1.65 m 3. Then square the height in meters: 1.65 times 1.65 =2.72 4. Calculate BMI 68.18 2.72 =25 11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 280CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 281 if nutritional counseling is to be realistic and appropriate. Nurses need to be aware of these factors to ensure indi-vidualized teaching and care. Cultural Variations and Restrictions Food is important to every cultural group. It is often part of celebrations and rituals. When working with womenfrom various cultures, the nurse needs to adapt Ameri-can nutritional guidelines to meet their nutritional needswithin their cultural framework. Food choices and vari-ations for different cultures might include the following: Bread, cereal, rice and pasta group: Bolello dairy: Buttermilk Buffalo milk Soybean milk Lactose Intolerance The best source of calcium is milk and dairy products, but for women with lactose intolerance, adaptations arenecessary. Women with lactose intolerance lack an en-zyme (lactase) needed for the breakdown of lactose intoits component simple sugars, glucose, and galactose. With-out adequate lactase, lactose passes through the small intestine undigested and causes abdominal discomfort,gas, and diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is especially com- mon among women of African, Asian, and Middle Easterndescent (Dudek, 2006). Additional or substitute sources of calcium may be necessary. These may include peanuts, almonds, sun- flower seeds, broccoli, salmon, kale, and molasses (Escott- Stump, 2007). In addition, encourage the woman to drink lactose-free dairy products or calcium-enriched orangejuice or soy milk.Vegetarians Vegetarian diets are becoming increasing prevalent in the United States. People choose a vegetarian diet forvarious reasons, including environmental, animal rights,philosophical, religious, and health beliefs (Hughes &Brown, 2006). Vegetarians choose not to eat meat,chicken, and fish. Their diets consist mostly of plant-based foods, such as legumes, vegetables, whole grains,nuts, and seeds. Vegetarians fall into groups dened by thetypes of foods they eat. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians omit redmeat, sh, and poultry but eat eggs, milk, and dairy p rod- ucts, in addition to plant-based foods. Lacto-vegetariansconsume milk and dairy products along with plant-basedfoods; they omit eggs, meat, fish, and poultry. Veganseliminate all foods from animals, including milk, eggs, andcheese, and eat only plant-based foods (Dudek, 2006). The concern with any form of vegetarianism, espe- cially during pregnancy, is that the diet may be inadequatein nutrients. Other risks of vegetarian eating patterns dur-ing pregnancy may include low gestational weight gain,iron-deciency anemia, compromised protein utilization,and decreased mineral absorption (Dudek, 2006). Adiet can become so restrictive that a woman is not gain-ing weight or is consistently not eating enough from one or more of the food groups. Generally, the more restrictivethe diet, the greater the chance of nutrient deciencies. Well-balanced vegetarian diets that include dairy caloric and nutrient intake and donot require special supplementation; however, vegan dietsdo not include any meat, eggs, or dairy products. Preg-nant vegetarians must pay special attention to their intakeof protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin B12. Suggestionsinclude: For protein: substitute soy foods, beans, lentils, nuts, grains, and seeds. For iron: eat a variety of meat alternatives, along with vitamin C-rich foods. For calcium: substitute soy, calcium-fortied orange juice, and tofu. For vitamin B12: eat fortied soy foods and a B12 supplement. The woman may also take a multivitamin prenatal supplement (Hughes & Brown, 2006). Pica Many women experience unusual food cravings dur- ing their pregnancy. Having cravings during pregnancyis perfectly normal. Sometimes, however, women cravesubstances that have no nutritional value and can even bedangerous to themselves and their fetus. Pica is the com- pulsive ingestion of nonfood substances. Pica is derivedfrom the Latin term for magpie, a bird that is known toconsume a variety of nonfood substances. Unlike the bird,however, pregnant women who develop a pica habit typ-ically have one or two specic cravings.11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 281282 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY The exact cause of pica is not known. Many theo- ries have been advanced to explain it, but none has been proven scientically. The incidence of pica is difcult todetermine, since it is underreported. It is more commonin the United States among African-American womencompared to other ethnicities, but the practice of pica isnot limited to any one geographic area, race, creed, or cul-ture. In the United States, pica is also common in womenfrom rural areas and women with a family history of it(Mikkelsen, Andersen, & Olsen, 2007) The three main substances consumed by women with pica are soil or clay (geophagia), ice (pagophagia),and laundry starch (amylophagia). Nutritional implica-tions and causes iron-deciency anemia Clay: produces constipation; can contain toxic substances and cause parasitic infection Ice: can cause iron-deciency anemia, tooth fractures, freezer burn injuries Laundry starch: replaces iron-rich foods, leads to iron deciencies, and replaces protein metabolism, thusdepriving the fetus of amino acids needed for properdevelopment (Blackburn, 2007) Clinical manifestations of anemia often precede the identication of pica because it is rarely addressed by thehealth care provider and the woman does not usuallyvolunteer such information (Cunningham et al., 2005).Secrecy surrounding this habit makes research and di-agnosis difficult because some women fail to view theirbehavior as anything unusual, harmful, or worth report-ing.Because of the clinical implications, pica should be discussed with all pregnant women as a preventivemeasure. The topic can be part of a general discussion ofcravings, and the nurse should stress the harmful effectsoutlined above. Suspect pica when the woman exhibits anemia al- though her dietary intake is appropriate. Ask about herusual dietary intake, and include questions about theingestion of nonfood substances. Consider the potentialnegative outcomes for the pregnant woman and her fetus,and take appropriate action. Psychosocial Adaptations During Pregnancy Pregnancy is a unique time in a woman's life. It is a time of dramatic alterations in her body and her appearance,as well as a time of change in her social status. All thesechanges occur simultaneously. Concurrent with the phys-iologic changes within her body systems are psychosocial changes within the mother and family members as theyface signicant role and lifestyle changes.Maternal Emotional Responses Motherhood, perhaps more than any role in society, has acquired a special significance for women. Women aretaught they should nd fulllment and satisfaction \"ever-bountiful, (Thies & Travers, 2006). With such high expec-tations, many pregnant women experience various emo- tions throughout their pregnancy. The woman's approachto these emotions is influenced by her emotional makeup,her sociologic and cultural background, her acceptanceor rejection of the pregnancy, whether the pregnancy wasplanned, if the father is known, and her support network(Alexander et al., 2007). Despite the wide-ranging emotions associated with the pregnancy, many women experience similar responses.These responses commonly include ambivalence, intro-version, acceptance, mood swings, and changes in bodyimage. Ambivalence The realization of a pregnancy can lead to fluctuating re- sponses, possibly at the opposite ends of the spectrum. For example, regardless of whether the pregnancy wasplanned, the woman may feel proud and excited at herachievement while at the same time fearful and anxious ofthe implications. The reactions are influenced by severalfactors, including the way the woman was raised, her cur-rent family situation, the quality of the relationship withthe expectant father, and her hopes for the future. Somewomen express concern over the timing of the pregnancy,wishing that goals and life objectives had been met beforebecoming pregnant. Other women may question how anewborn or infant will affect their career or their relation-ships with friends and family. These feelings can causeconflict and confusion about the pregnancy. Ambivalence, or having conflicting feelings at the same time, is a universal feeling and is considered normal whenpreparing for a lifestyle change and new role. Pregnantwomen commonly experience ambivalence during therst trimester. Usually ambivalence evolves into accep-tance by the second trimester, when fetal movement is felt. The woman's personality, her ability to adapt to changingcircumstances, and the reactions of her partner will affecther adjustment to being pregnant and her acceptance ofimpending motherhood. Introversion Introversion, or focusing on oneself, is common during theearly part of pregnancy. The woman may withdraw andbecome increasingly preoccupied with herself and herfetus. As a result, her participation with the outside worldmay be less, and she will appear passive to her family andfriends. This introspective behavior is a normal psycholog- ical adaptation to motherhood for most women. Intro-11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 282CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 283 version seems to heighten during the first and third trimesters, when the woman's focus is on behaviors thatwill ensure a safe and health pregnancy outcome. Couplesneed to be aware of this behavior and should be informedabout measures to maintain and support the focus onthe family. Acceptance During the second trimester, the physical changes ofthe growing fetus with an enlarging abdomen and fetalmovement bring reality and validity to the pregnancy.There are many tangible signs that someone separate fromherself is present. The pregnant woman feels fetal move- ment and may hear the heartbeat. She may see the fetal image on an ultrasound screen and feel distinct parts, recognizing independent sleep and wake patterns. Shebecomes able to identify the fetus as a separate individ-ual and accepts this. Many women will verbalize positive feelings about the pregnancy and will conceptualize the fetus. The womanmay accept her new body image and talk about the new lifewithin. Generating a discussion about the woman's feel- ings and offering support and validation at prenatal visitsare important. Mood Swings Emotional lability is characteristic throughout most preg-nancies. One moment a woman can feel great joy, and within a short time she can feel shock and disbelief. Fre-quently, pregnant women will start to cry without any apparent cause. Some women feel as though they areriding an \"emotional roller-coaster.\" These extremes inemotion can make it difcult for partners and family mem-bers to communicate with the pregnant woman without placing blame on themselves for their mood changes.Clear explanations about how common mood swings are during pregnancy are essential. Change in Body Image The way in which pregnancy affects a woman's bodyimage varies greatly from person to person. Some womenfeel as if they have never been more beautiful, whereasothers spend their pregnancy feeling overweight and un-comfortable. For some women pregnancy is a relief fromworrying about weight, whereas for others it only exacer-bates their fears of weight gain. Changes in body image arenormal but can be very stressful for the pregnant woman.Offering a thorough explanation and initiating discussionof the expected bodily changes may help the family tocope with them. Maternal Role Tasks Reva Rubin (1984) identied maternal tasks that a womanmust accomplish to incorporate the maternal role intoher personality. Accomplishing these tasks helps the expec- tantmother to develop her self-concept as a mother andto form a mutually gratifying relationship with her infant. These tasks are listed in Box 11.4. Pregnancy and Sexuality The way a pregnant woman feels and experiences her bodyduring pregnancy can affect her sexuality. The woman'schanging shape, emotional status, fetal activity, changesin breast size, pressure on the bladder, and other discom-forts of pregnancy result in increased physical and emo- tional demands. These can produce stress on the sexualrelationship between the pregnant woman and her partner.As the changes of pregnancy ensue, many partners becomeconfused, anxious, and fearful of how the relationship maybe affected. Sexual desire of pregnant women may change throughout the pregnancy. During the first trimester,the woman may be less interested in sex because of BOX 11.4 Maternal Role Tasks Ensuring safe passage throughout pregnancy and birth Primary focus of the woman's attention First trimester: woman focuses on herself, not on the fetus Second trimester: woman develops attachment of great value to her fetus Third trimester: woman has concern for herself and her fetus as a unit Participation in positive self-care activities related to diet, exercise, and overall well-being Seeking acceptance of infant by others First trimester: acceptance of pregnancy by herself and others Second trimester: family needs to relate to the fetus as member Third trimester: unconditional acceptance without rejection Seeking acceptance of self in maternal role to infant (\"binding in\") First trimester: mother accepts idea of pregnancy, but not of infant Second trimester: with sensation of fetal movement (quickening), mother acknowledges fetus as a separate entity within her Third trimester: mother longs to hold infant and becomes tired of being pregnant Learning to give of oneself First trimester: identies what must be given up to assume new role Second trimester: identies with infant, learns how to delay own desires Third trimester: questions her ability to become a good mother to infant (Rubin, 1984)11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 283284 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY fatigue, nausea, and fear of disturbing the early embry- onic development. During the second trimester, her interest may increase because of the stability of thepregnancy. During the third trimester, her enlarging sizemay produce discomfort during sexual activity (Frieden& Chan, 2007). A woman's sexual health is intimately linked to her own self-image. Sexual positions to increase comfort asthe pregnancy progresses as well as alternative noncoital modes of sexual expression, such as cuddling, caressing,and holding, should be discussed. Giving permission totalk about and then normalizing sexuality can help enhancethe sexual experience during pregnancy and, ultimately,the couple's relationship. If avenues of communicationare open regarding sexuality during pregnancy, any fearsand myths the couple may have can be dispelled. Pregnancy and the Partner Nursing care related to childbirth has expanded from a narrow emphasis on the physical health needs of themother and infant to a broader focus on family-related, social and emotional needs. One prominent feature ofthis family-centered approach is the recent movementtoward promoting the mother-infant bond. To achieve atruly family-centered practice, nursing must make a com-parable commitment to understanding and meeting theneeds of the partner in the emerging family. Recent studiessuggest that the partner's potential contribution to theinfant's overall development has been misperceived ordevalued and that the partner's ability and willingness toassume a more active role in the infant's care may havebeen underestimated. Reactions to pregnancy and to the psychological and physical changes by the woman's partner vary greatly.Some enjoy the role of being the nurturer, whereas othersexperience alienation and may seek comfort or compan-ionship elsewhere. Some expectant fathers may view pregnancy as proof of their masculinity and assume thedominant role, whereas others see their role as minimal, leaving the pregnancy up to the woman entirely. Each ex-pectant partner reacts uniquely. Emotionally and psychologically, expectant partners may undergo less visible changes than women, but mostof these changes remain unexpressed and unappreciated(Thies & Travers, 2006). Expectant partners also experi- ence a multitude of adjustments and concerns. Physically,they may gain weight around the middle and experiencenausea and other GI disturbances\u2014what is termed cou- vade syndrome, a sympathetic response to their partner's pregnancy. They also experience ambivalence during earlypregnancy, with extremes of emotions (e.g., pride and joyversus an overwhelming sense of impending responsibility). During the second trimester of pregnancy, partners go through acceptance of their role of breadwinner, care-taker, and support person. They come to accept the real-ity of the fetus when movement is felt, and they experience confusion when dealing with the woman's mood swingsand introspection. During the third trimester, the expec-tant partner prepares for the reality of this new role and negotiates what the role will be during the labor andbirthing process. Many express concern about being the primary support person during labor and birth and worryhow they will react when faced with their loved one inpain. Expectant partners share many of the same anxietiesas their pregnant partners. However, it is uncommon forthem to reveal these anxieties to the pregnant partner orhealth care professionals. Often, how the expectant part-ner responds during the third trimester depends on thestate of the marriage or partnership. When the marriage orpartnership is struggling, the impending increase in re-sponsibility toward the end of pregnancy acts to drive theexpectant partner further away. Often it manifests as work-ing late, staying out late with friends, or beginning new orsupercial relationships. In the stable marriage or partner-ship, the expectant partner who may have been strugglingto nd his or her place in the pregnancy now nds concretetasks to do\u2014for example, painting the nursery, assem- bling the car seat, attending Lamaze classes, and so on. Pregnancy and Siblings A sibling's reaction to pregnancy is age-dependent. Some children might express excitement and anticipation,whereas others might have negative reactions. A youngtoddler might regress in toilet training or ask to drink froma bottle again. An older school-aged child may ignore thenew addition to the family and engage in outside activitiesto avoid the new member. The introduction of an infantinto the family is often the beginning of sibling rivalry,which results from the child's fear of change in the secu-rity of the relationship with his or her parents (Thies &Travers, 2006). Preparation of the siblings for the antici-pated birth is imperative and must be designed accord- ing to the age and life experiences of the sibling at home.Constant reinforcement of love and caring will help to re-duce the older child's fear of change and worry aboutbeing replaced by the new family member. If possible, parents should include siblings in prepa- ration for the birth of the new baby to help them feel as ifthey have an important role to play (Fig. 11.6). Parentsmust also continue to focus on the older sibling after thebirth to reduce regressive or aggressive behavior towardthe newborn. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Pregnancy is a normal life event that involves consider- able physical, psychosocial, emotional, and relationshipadjustments. /H18546The signs and symptoms of pregnancy have been grouped into those that are subjective (presumptive)11223-11_CH11.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 284CHAPTER 11 MATERNAL ADAPTATION DURING PREGNANCY 285 and experienced by the woman herself, those that are objective ( probable) and observed by the health care professional, and those that are the positive, beyond-the-shadow-of-a-doubt signs. /H18546Physiologically, almost every system of a woman's body changes during pregnancy with startling rapidity to ac-commodate the needs of the growing fetus.

Nursesneed to use touch often.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 288CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 289 regnancy is a time of many physiologic and psychological changes that can positively or negatively affect the woman,her fetus, and her family. Misconceptions, inadequateinformation, and unanswered questions about pregnancy,birth, and parenthood are common. The ultimate goalof any pregnancy is the birth of a healthy newborn, andnurses play a major role in helping the pregnant womanand her partner achieve this goal. Ongoing assessmentand education are essential. This chapter describes the nursing management re- quired during pregnancy. It begins with a brief discussionof preconception care and then describes the assessmentof the woman at the rst prenatal visit and on follow-upvisits. The chapter discusses tests commonly used to assessmaternal and fetal well-being, including specic nursingmanagement related to each test. The chapter also iden- ties important strategies to minimize the common dis-comforts of pregnancy and promote self-care. Lastly, the chapter discusses perinatal education, including childbirtheducation, birthing options, care provider options, prepa-ration for breastfeeding or bottle feeding, and nal prepa-ration for labor and birth. Preconception Care Ideally, couples thinking about having a child shouldschedule a visit with their health care provider for precon-ception counseling to ensure that they are in the best pos-sible state of health before pregnancy. Preconception care is the promotion of the health and well-being of a woman and her partner before pregnancy. The goal ofpreconception care is to identify any areas such as healthproblems, lifestyle habits, or social concerns that might un-favorably affect pregnancy (Dunlop, Jack, & Frey, 2007). Risk Factors for Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Preconception care is just as important as prenatal care to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes such as maternal andinfant mortality, preterm births, and low-birthweight in-fants. Adverse pregnancy outcomes constitute a major pub-lic health challenge: 12% of infants are born premature; 8%are with low birthweight; 3% have major birth defects;and 32% of women suffer pregnancy complications (Cen-ters for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC], 2007b). Risk factors for these adverse pregnancy outcomes are prevalent among women of reproductive age, asdemonstrated by the following statistics: 12% of women smoke during pregnancy, contributing to fetal addiction to nicotine. 13% consume alcohol during pregnancy, leading to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. 70% of women do not take folic acid supplements, increasing the risk of neural tube defects in the newborn.P BOX 12.1 Risk Factors for Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Taking retinoic acid (Accutane) to clear cystic acne Alcohol use Anti-epileptic drugs Autoimmune Smoking 2006) UnderweightTaking folic acid reduces the incidence of neural tube defects by two thirds. 32% of women starting a pregnancy are obese, which may increase their risk of developing hypertension, diabetes, and thromboembolic disease and may increase the need for cesarean birth. 3% take prescription or over-the-counter drugs that are known teratogens (substances harmful to the de-veloping fetus). 5% of women have preexisting medical conditions that can negatively affect pregnancy if unmanaged(CDC, 2007b). All of the factors above pose risks to pregnancy and could be addressed with early interventions if the womansought preconception health care. Specic recognized riskfactors for adverse pregnancy outcomes that fall into oneor more of the above categories are listed in Box 12.1. The period of greatest environmental sensitivity and consequent risk for the developing embryo is betweendays 17 and 56 after conception. The rst prenatal visit,which is usually a month or later after a missed menstrualperiod, may occur too late to affect reproductive outcomesassociated with abnormal organogenesis secondary to poorlifestyle choices. In some cases, such as with unplannedpregnancies, women may delay seeking health care, deny-ing that they are pregnant. Thus, commonly used preven-tion practices may begin too late to avert the morbidity andmortality associated with congenital anomalies and lowbirthweight (Atrash et al., 2006). Therefore, it is best thatthe woman and her partner seek preconception care. What is the purpose of couples like Linda and Rob going for preconception counseling? What are the goals ofpreconception care for this couple? Sources: CDC (2008); NIH of Dimes (2008).11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 289290 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Nursing Management Preconception care involves obtaining a complete health history and physical examination of the woman and herpartner. Key areas include: Immunization status of the woman Underlying medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and respiratory problems or genetic disorders Reproductive health data, such as pelvic examinations, use of contraceptives, and sexually transmitted infec-tions (STIs) Sexuality and sexual practices, such as safer-sex practices and body image issues Nutrition history and present status Lifestyle practices, including occupation and recreational activities Psychosocial issues such as levels of stress, exposure to abuse and violence Medication and drug use, including use of tobacco, alcohol, over-the-counter and prescription medications, and illicit drugs Support system, including family, friends, and community (Fig. 12.1 gives a sample preconceptionscreening tool) This information provides a foundation for planning health-promotion activities and education. For example,to have a positive impact on the pregnancy: Ensure that the woman's immunizations are up to date. Take a thorough history of both partners to identify any medical or genetic conditions that need treatmentor a referral to specialists. Identify history of STIs and high-risk sexual practices so they can be modied. Complete a dietary history combined with nutritional counseling. Gather information regarding exercise and lifestyle practices to encourage daily exercise for well-beingand weight maintenance. Stress the importance of taking folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. Urge the woman to achieve optimal weight before a pregnancy. Identify work environment and any needed changes to promote health. Address substance use issues, including smoking and drugs. Identify victims of violence and assist them to get help. Manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. Educate the couple about environmental hazards, including metals and herbs. Offer genetic counseling to identify carriers. Suggest the availability of support systems, if needed (Graham, 2006). Nurses can act as advocates and educators, creat- ing healthy, supportive communities for women and theirpartners in the childbearing phases of their lives. It is important to enter into a collaborative partnership withthe woman and her partner, enabling them to examinetheir own health and its influence on the health of their future baby. Provide information to allow the woman andher partner to make an informed decision about havinga baby, but keep in mind that this decision rests solelywith the couple. Linda and Rob decide to change several aspects of their lifestyle and nutritional habits before conceiving a baby,based on advice from the nurse-midwife. They both want to lose weight, stop smoking, and increase their intake offruits and vegetables. How will these lifestyle and dietarychanges benet Linda's future pregnancy? What other areas might need to be brought up to date to prepare for afuture pregnancy? The First Prenatal Visit Once a pregnancy is suspected and, in some cases, ten-tatively conrmed by a home pregnancy test, the woman should seek prenatal care to promote a healthy outcome.Although the most opportune window (preconception)for improving pregnancy outcomes may be missed, ap-propriate nursing management starting at conceptionand continuing throughout the pregnancy can have a pos-itive impact on the health of pregnant women and theirunborn children. The assessment process begins at this initial prena- tal visit and continues throughout the pregnancy. Theinitial visit is an ideal time to screen for factors that mightplace the woman and her fetus at risk for problems suchas preterm delivery. The initial visit also is an optimaltime to begin educating the client about changes that willaffect her life. Counseling and education of the pregnant woman and her partner are critical to ensure healthy outcomes formother and her infant. Pregnant women and their partnersfrequently have questions, misinformation, or misconcep-tions about what to eat, weight gain, physical discomforts, drug and alcohol use, sexuality, and the birthing process.The nurse needs to allow time to answer questions andprovide anticipatory guidance during the pregnancy and tomake appropriate community referrals to meet the needsof these clients. To address these issues and foster the \"Preconception care should be integrated into the women's health care continuum to achieve high levels of lifetime wellness for all women\"(Dunlop, Jack, & Frey, 2007).Take NOTE! 11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 290CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 291 Does your family have a history of ___Hemophilia?___Other bleeding disorders?___Tay-Sachs disease?___Blood diseases _______________________ NOTES:Or Your partner's family ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ DATE: / / ___Are you taking prescribed drugs (Accutane, valproic acid, blood thinners)?

Comprehensive Health History During the initial visit, a comprehensive health history is obtained, including age, menstrual history, prior obstetrichistory, past medical and surgical history, family history,genetic screening, medication or drug use, and historyof exposure to infections (STIs) (Frieden & Chan, 2007).Often, using a prenatal history form (Fig. 12.2) is the bestway to document the data collected. The initial health history typically includes questions about three major areas: the reason for seeking care; theclient's past medical, surgical, and personal history, in-cluding that of the family and her partner; and the client'sreproductive history. During the history-taking process,the nurse and client establish the foundation of a trustingrelationship and jointly develop a plan of care for the preg-nancy. Tailor this plan to the client's lifestyle as much as possible and focus primarily on education for overall well-ness during the pregnancy. The ultimate goal is early de-tection and prevention of any problems that occur duringthe pregnancy (Frieden & Chan, 2007).Reason for Seeking Care The woman commonly comes for prenatal care based on the suspicion that she is pregnant. She may report thatshe has missed her menstrual period or has had a positiveresult on a home pregnancy test. Ask the woman for thedate of her last menstrual period (LMP). Also ask aboutany presumptive or probable signs of pregnancy that shemight be experiencing. Typically a urine or blood test tocheck for evidence of human chorionic gonadotropin(hCG) is done to confirm the pregnancy. Past History Ask about the woman's past medical and surgical his-tory. This information is important because conditions that the woman experienced in the past (e.g., urinarytract infections) may recur or be exacerbated during preg-nancy. Also, chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or heart disease, can increase the risk for complications duringpregnancy for the woman and her fetus. Ask about any his-tory of allergies to medications, foods, or environmentalsubstances. Ask about any mental health problems, suchas depression or anxiety. Gather similar information aboutthe woman's family and her partner. The woman's personal history also is important. Ask about her occupation, possible exposure to teratogens,exercise and activity level, recreational patterns (includingthe use of substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs),use of alternative and complementary therapies, sleep pat-terns, nutritional habits, and general lifestyle. Each of thesemay have an impact on the outcome of the pregnancy.For example, if the woman smokes during pregnancy,nicotine in the cigarettes causes vasoconstriction in themother, leading to reduced placental perfusion. As a re-sult, the newborn may be small for gestational age. Thenewborn will also go through nicotine withdrawal soonafter birth. In addition, no safe level of alcohol ingestion inpregnancy has been determined. Many fetuses exposed toheavy alcohol levels during pregnancy develop fetal alco- hol syndrome, a collection of deformities and disabilities. Reproductive History The woman's reproductive history includes a menstrual,obstetric, and gynecologic history. Typically, this historybegins with a description of the woman's menstrual cycle,including her age at menarche, number of days in hercycle, typical flow characteristics, and any discomfortexperienced. The use of contraception also is important,including when the woman last used any contraception. Ask the woman the date of her LMP to determine the estimated or expected date of birth (EDB) or delivery (EDD). Several methods may be used to estimate the dateof birth. Nagele's rule can be used to establish the EDDor EDB. Using this rule, subtract 3 months and then add7 days to the rst day of the LMP. Then correct the yearby adding 1 to it. This date has a margin of error of plus orminus 2 weeks. For instance, if a woman reports that herLMP was Oct. 14, 2007, you would subtract 3 monthsIncrease the proportion of pregnant women who receive early and adequateprenatal care:Increase the number of women receiving maternal prenatal care beginning in the rsttrimester of pregnancyfrom a baseline of 83% to90% of live births. Increase the number of women receiving early andadequate prenatal carefrom a baseline of 74% to90% of live births. Increase the proportion of pregnant women who at-tend a series of preparedchildbirth classes. Increase abstinence from al- cohol, cigarettes, and illicitdrugs among pregnantwomen.Will contribute to reduced rates of perinatal illness, disability, anddeath by helping to identify possible risk factors and imple-menting measures to lessen thesefactors that contribute to pooroutcomes Will contribute to a more pleasant birthing experience becausewomen will be prepared for whatthey will face; also help in reducingpain and anxiety Will help to reduce the wide- ranging effects, such as sponta-neous abortion, low birthweight,and preterm birth, associatedwith prenatal substance use Source: U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2000.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Objective Nursing Implications (text continues on page 295)11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 292CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 293 Patient's name ID.

The woman's EDD or EDB is July 21, 2008. Because of the normal variations in women's men- strual cycles, differences in the normal length of gestationbetween ethnic groups, and errors in dating methods,there is no such thing as an exact due date. In general, abirth 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after the EDD or EDBis considered normal. Nagele's rule is less accurate if thewoman's menstrual cycles are irregular, if the woman conceives while breastfeeding or before her regular men-strual cycle is established, if she is ovulating although sheis amenorrheic, or after she discontinues oral contracep-tives (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). A gestational or birth calculator or wheel can also be used to calculate the due date (Fig. 12.3). Some practi-tioners use ultrasound to more accurately determine thegestational age and date the pregnancy. Typically, an obstetric history provides information about the woman's past pregnancies, including any prob-lems encountered during the pregnancy, labor, deliv-ery, and afterward. Such information can provide cluesto problems that might develop in the current pregnancy. Some common terms used to describe and document anobstetric history include: Gravid: the state of being pregnant Gravida : a pregnant woman; gravida I (primigravida) during the rst pregnancy, gravida II (secundigravida)during the second pregnancy, and so onPara : The number of pregnancies that a woman has, regardless of whether the newborn is born alive or dead.Thus, a primipara is a woman who has given birth onceafter a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks, commonly re-ferred to as a \"primip\" in clinical practice. A multiparais a woman who has had two or more pregnancies re-sulting in viable offspring, commonly referred to as a\"multip.\" Nullipara (para 0) is a woman who has notproduced a viable offspring. Other systems may be used to document a woman's obstetric history. These systems often break down thecategory of para more specifically (Box 12.2). Information about the woman's gynecologic history is important. Ask about any reproductive tract surgeriesthe woman has undergone. For example, surgery on theuterus may affect its ability to contract effectively duringlabor. A history of tubal pregnancy increases the woman's risk for another tubal pregnancy. Also ask about safe-sexpractices and any history of STIs. Physical Examination The next step in the assessment process is the physicalexamination, which detects any physical problems thatmay affect the pregnancy outcome. The initial physicalexamination provides the baseline for evaluating changes during future visits.30 3940383736 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28 27 26252423222120191817161514 13 121110 9 8 7 6 5510152025 30 5 10 15 20 25 30 5 10 20 25 5 10 15 20 25305101520253051015202530510152025JULY AUGUST SEPTEM BER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE 53413122 159 525283236394346 50 53 56 59 62 666770737578AFP AMNIOCENTESIS EARLY AMNIO CVS ASSESSMENT/SCREENING CRL mm WEIGHT WEEKS BPD mm PRENATAL GENETIC RISK OF DELIVERY (\u00b1 5 DAYS) APPROXIMATE DATE PROBABLE DAY OF CONCEPTION FIRST DAY OF LAST MENSTRUAL PERIOD FIGURE12.3 EDB using a birth wheel.

Copyright Marchof Dimes, 2007.)11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 295296 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Preparation Instruct the client to undress and put on a gown. Also ask her to empty her bladder and, in doing so, to collect a urinespecimen. Typically this specimen is a clean-catch urinespecimen that is sent to the laboratory for a urinalysis todetect a possible urinary tract infection. Begin the physical examination by obtaining vital signs, including blood pressure, respiratory rate, tem-perature, and pulse. Also measure the client's height and weight. Abnormalities such as an elevated blood pressuremay suggest pregestational hypertension, requiring fur-ther evaluation. Abnormalities in pulse rate and respira- tion require further investigation for possible cardiac orrespiratory disease. If the woman weighs less than 100pounds or more than 200 pounds or there has been a sud-den weight gain, report these ndings to the primary careprovider; medical treatment or nutritional counseling maybe necessary. Head-to-Toe Assessment A complete head-to-toe assessment is usually performed bythe health care professional. Every body system is assessed.Some of the major areas are discussed here. Throughoutthe assessment, be sure to drape the client appropriatelyto ensure privacy and prevent chilling. Head and Neck Assess the head and neck area for any previous injuries andsequelae. Evaluate for any limitations in range of motion.Palpate for any enlarged lymph nodes or swelling. Noteany edema of the nasal mucosa or hypertrophy of gin-gival tissue in the mouth; these are typical responses to increased estrogen levels in pregnancy. Palpate the thy-roid gland for enlargement is enlargement may indicate hyperthyroidism,requiring further investigation. Chest Auscultate heart sounds, noting any abnormalities. Asoft systolic murmur caused by the increase in blood vol- ume may be noted. Anticipate an increase in heart rateby 10 to 15 beats per minute (starting between 14 and20 weeks of pregnancy) secondary to increases in cardiac output and blood volume. The body adapts to the increasein blood volume with peripheral dilatation to maintain blood pressure. Progesterone causes peripheral dilatation. Auscultate the chest for breath sounds, which should be clear. Also note symmetry of chest movement and tho-racic breathing patterns. Estrogen promotes relaxation ofthe ligaments and joints of the ribs, with a resulting in-crease in the anteroposterior chest diameter. Expect a slight increase in respiratory rate to accommodate the increasein tidal volume and oxygen consumption. Inspect and palpate the breasts. Increases in estrogen and progesterone and blood supply make the breasts feelfull and more nodular, with increased sensitivity to touch.Blood vessels become more visible and there is an increasein breast size. Striae gravidarum (stretch marks) may bevisible in women with large breasts. Darker pigmentationof the nipple and areola is present, along with enlargementof Montgomery's glands. Abdomen The appearance of the abdomen depends on the numberof weeks of gestation. The abdomen enlarges progressivelyas the fetus grows. Palpate the abdomen, which should berounded and nontender. A decrease in muscle tone maybe noted due to the influence of progesterone. Inspectionalso may reveal striae gravidarum (stretch marks) andlinea nigra, depending on the duration of the pregnancy. Typically, the height of the fundus is measured when the uterus arises out of the pelvis to evaluate fetal growth.At 12 weeks' gestation the fundus can be palpated pubis. 16 weeks' symphysis and the umbilicus. At20 fundus can be palpated at the umbilicus andmeasures approximately 20 cm from the symphysis pubis.By 36 weeks the fundus is just below the ensiform cartilageand measures approximately 36 cm. The uterus maintainsa globular/ovoid shape throughout pregnancy (Frieden &Chan, =term P L current pregnancyT\u2014the term P\u2014the number of preterm pregnancies ending >20 weeks or viability but before completion of 37 weeks A\u2014the number of pregnancies ending before 20 weeks or viability L\u2014the number of children currently living Consider this example:Mary Johnson is pregnant for the fourth time.

If edema is present in early pregnancy,further evaluation may be needed to rule out gestationalhypertension. Ask the woman if she has any pain in her calfthat increases when she ambulates. This might indicate adeep vein thrombosis (DVT). High levels of estrogen dur-ing pregnancy place women at higher risk for DVT. Pelvic Examination The pelvic examination provides information about theinternal and external reproductive organs. In addition,it aids in assessing some of the presumptive and proba-ble signs of pregnancy and allows for determination ofpelvic adequacy. During the pelvic examination, remainin the examining room to assist the health care providerwith any specimen collection, xation, and labeling. Alsoprovide comfort and emotional support for the woman,who might be anxious. Throughout the examination, ex-plain what is happening and why, and answer any ques-tions as necessary. External Genitalia After the client is placed in the lithotomy position anddraped appropriately, the external genitalia are inspectedvisually. They should be free from lesions, discharge,hematomas, varicosities, and inflammation upon inspec- tion. A culture for STIs may be collected at this time. Internal Genitalia Next, the internal genitalia are examined via a speculum.The cervix should be smooth, long, thick, and closed.Because of increased pelvic congestion, the cervix will besoftened (Goodell's sign), the uterine isthmus will be soft-ened (Hegar's sign), and there will be a bluish colorationof the cervix and vaginal mucosa (Chadwick's sign). The uterus typically is pear-shaped and mobile, with a smooth surface. It will undergo cell hypertrophy and hyper-plasia so that it enlarges throughout the pregnancy to ac- commodate the growing fetus. During the pelvic examination, a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear may be obtained. Additional cultures, such as forgonorrhea and chlamydia screening and group B strepto-coccus screening, also may be obtained. Ensure that all specimens obtained are labeled correctly and sent to thelaboratory for evaluation. A rectal examination is done lastto assess for lesions, masses, prolapse, or hemorrhoids. Once the examination of the internal genitalia is com- pleted and the speculum is removed, a bimanual exam- ination is performed to estimate the size of the uterus to confirm dates and to palpate the ovaries. The ovariesshould be small and nontender, without masses. At theconclusion of the bimanual examination, the health careprofessional reinserts the index nger into the vagina andthe middle nger into the rectum to assess the strengthand regularity of the posterior vaginal wall. Pelvic Size, Shape, and Measurements The size and shape of the women's pelvis can affect herability to deliver vaginally. Pelvic shape is typically clas-sied as one of four types: gynecoid, android, anthropoid,and platypelloid. Refer to Chapter 13 for an in-depth dis-cussion of pelvic size and shape. Taking internal pelvic measurements determines the actual diameters of the inlet and outlet through which thefetus will pass. This is extremely important if the womanhas never given birth vaginally. Taking pelvic measure-ments is unnecessary for the woman who has given birthvaginally before (unless she has experienced some type oftrauma to the area) because vaginal delivery demonstratesthat the pelvis is adequate for the passage of the fetus. Three measurements are assessed: diagonal conju- gate, true conjugate, and ischial tuberosity (Fig. 12.4). The diagonal conjugate is the distance between the anteriorsurface of the sacral prominence and the anterior surface B A FIGURE12.4 Pelvic measurements. ( A) Diagonal conjugate (solid line) and tuberosity diameter.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 297298 UNIT THREE of the inferior margin of the symphysis pubis (Frieden & Chan, 2007). This measurement, usually 12.5 cm orgreater, represents the anteroposterior diameter of thepelvic inlet. The diagonal conjugate is the most useful mea-surement for estimating pelvic size because a mist with the fetal head occurs if it is too small. The true conjugate, also called the obstetric conju- gate, is the measurement from the anterior surface ofthe sacral prominence to the posterior surface of the infe-rior margin of the symphysis pubis. This diameter cannotbe measured directly; rather, it is estimated by subtract-ing 1 to 2 cm from the diagonal conjugate measurement. The average true conjugate diameter is at least 11.5 cm(Cunningham et al., 2005). This measurement is im-portant because it is the smallest front-to-back diameterthrough which the fetal head must pass when movingthrough the pelvic inlet. The ischial tuberosity diameter is the transverse diam- eter of the pelvic outlet. This measurement is made outside the pelvis at the lowest aspect of the ischial tuberosities.A diameter of 10.5 cm or more is considered adequate forpassage of the fetal head (Blackburn, 2007). Laboratory Tests A series of tests are generally ordered during the initial visit so that baseline data can be obtained, allowing for early de-tection and prompt intervention if any problems occur. Tests that are generally conducted for all pregnant womeninclude urinalysis and blood studies. The urine is analyzedfor albumin, glucose, ketones, and bacteria casts. Bloodstudies usually include a complete blood count (hemoglo-bin, hematocrit, red and white blood cell counts, andplatelets), blood typing and Rh factor, a rubella titer, hep-atitis B surface antibody antigen, HIV, VDRL, and RPRtests, and cervical smears to detect STIs (Common Labo-ratory and Diagnostic Tests 12.1). In addition, most ofcesand clinics have ultrasound equipment available to validatean intrauterine pregnancy and assess early fetal growth. The need for additional laboratory studies is deter- mined by a woman's history, physical examination find-ings, current health status, and risk factors identified inthe initial interview. Additional tests can be offered, butultimately the woman and her partner make the deci-sion about undergoing them. Educate the client and herpartner about the tests, including the rationale. In addi-tion, support the client and her partner in their decision-making process, regardless of whether you agree with the couple's decision. The couple's decisions about theirhealth care are based on the ethical principle of autonomy,which allows an individual the right to make decisionsabout his or her own body.

Ten months after the preconception appointment,Linda calls to make a rst prenatal appointment. What keyareas will be addressed at this rst prenatal visit? Whatinterventions might be suggested for Linda to implement inorder to ensure a healthy newborn? Follow-Up Visits Continuous prenatal care is important for a successfulpregnancy outcome. The recommended follow-up visitschedule for a healthy pregnant woman is as follows: Every 4 weeks up to 28 weeks (7 months) Every 2 weeks from 29 to 36 weeks Every week from 37 weeks to birth At each subsequent prenatal visit the following assess- ments are completed: Weight and blood pressure, which are compared to baseline values Urine testing for protein, glucose, ketones, and nitrites Fundal height measurement to assess fetal growth Assessment for quickening/fetal movement to determine fetal well-being Assessment of fetal heart rate (should be 110 to 160 bpm) At each follow-up visit, answer questions, provide anticipatory guidance and education, review nutritionalguidelines, and evaluate the client for compliance with pre-natal vitamin therapy. Throughout the pregnancy, encour-age the woman's partner to participate if possible. Fundal Height Measurement Fundal height is the distance (in cm) measured with atape measure from the top of the pubic bone to the top ofthe uterus (fundus) with the client lying on her back withher knees slightly flexed (Fig. 12.5). Measurement in thisway is termed the McDonald's method. Fundal height typically increases as the pregnancy progresses; it reflectsfetal growth and provides a gross estimate of the durationof the pregnancy. Between 12 and 14 weeks' gestation, the fundus can be palpated above the symphysis pubis. The fundus reachesthe level of the umbilicus at approximately 20 weeks andmeasures 20 cm. Fundal measurement should approx-imately equal the number of weeks of gestation untilweek 36. For example, a fundal height of 24 cm suggests a fetus at 24 weeks' gestation. After 36 weeks, the fundalheight then drops due to lightening and may no longercorrespond with the week of gestation. It is expected that the fundal height will increase progressively throughout the pregnancy, reflecting fetalgrowth. However, if the growth curve flattens or stays stable, it may indicate the presence of intrauterine growthrestriction (IUGR). If the fundal height measurementis greater than 4 cm from the estimated gestational age,further evaluation is warranted if a multifetal gestation hasnot been diagnosed or hydramnios has not been ruled out(Dillon, 2007). Fetal Movement Determination Fetal movement is usually perceived by the client between 16 and 20 weeks' gestation. Perceived fetal movement ismost often related to trunk and limb motion and rollovers, or flips (Arenson & Drake, 2007). Fetal movement is agross indicator of fetal well-being. Decreased fetal move-ment may indicate asphyxia and IUGR. If compromised,the fetus decreases its oxygen requirements by decreasingactivity (Mangesi & Hofmeyr, 2007). A decrease in fetalmovement may be related to other factors as well, such asmaternal use of central nervous system depressants, fetalsleep cycles, hydrocephalus, bilateral renal agenesis, andbilateral hip dislocation (Arenson & Drake, 2007). Two suggested techniques for determining fetal move- ment, also called fetal movement counts, are the Cardiff technique and the Sadovsky technique (Box 12.3). Fetalmovement is a noninvasive method of screening and canbe easily taught to all pregnant women. Both techniquesrequire client participation. Instruct the client about how to count fetal move- ments, the reasons for doing so, and the significance ofdecreased fetal movements. Urge the client to perform the counts in a relaxed environment and a comfortableposition, such as semi-Fowler's or side-lying. Provide theclient with detailed information concerning fetal move-ment counts and stress the need for consistency in mon-itoring (at approximately the same time each day) and theimportance of informing the health care provider promptlyof any reduced movements. Providing clients with \"fetalkick count\" charts to record movement helps promotecompliance. There is no established number of fetal move-ments that indicates fetal measurement.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 299300 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY woman to report a count of less than three fetal movements within an hour. Further investigation with a nonstress testor biophysical profile is usually warranted (Mangesi &Hofmeyr, 2007). Fetal Heart Rate Measurement Fetal heart rate measurement is integral to fetal surveil-lance throughout the pregnancy. Auscultating the fetal heart rate with a handheld Doppler at each prenatal visithelps conrm that the intrauterine environment is still sup-portive to the growing fetus. The purpose of assessing fetal heart rate is to determine rate and rhythm. Nursing Pro-cedure 12.1 lists the steps in measuring fetal heart rate. Follow-Up Visit Intervals and Assessments Up to 28 weeks' gestation, follow-up visits involve assess- ment of the client's blood pressure and weight. The urineis tested for protein and glucose. Fundal height and fetal heart rate are assessed at every ofce visit. Between weeks24 and 28, a blood glucose level is obtained using a 50-gglucose load followed by a 1-hour plasma glucose deter- mination. If the result is more than 140 mg/dL, furthertesting, such as a 3-hour 100-g glucose tolerance test, is warranted to determine whether gestational diabetesis present. During this time, review the common discomforts of pregnancy, evaluate any client complaints, and answerquestions. Reinforce the importance of good nutritionand use of prenatal vitamins, along with daily exercise. Between 29 and 36 weeks' gestation, all the assess- ments of previous visits are completed, along with as-sessment for edema. Special attention is focused on the presence and location of edema during the last trimester. Pregnant women commonly experience dependent edemaof the lower extremities from constriction of blood ves-sels secondary to the heavy gravid uterus. PeriorbitalBOX 12.3 Techniques for Fetal Movement Counts Maternal perception of fetal movements or counting fetal movements is an inexpensive, noninvasive methodof assessing fetal well-being. Several different techniques,two of which are described below, can be used. Scienticevidence has not shown that one technique is betterthan another. However, the amount of time required for the client to complete the count varies. Additionally,because counts are highly subjective on the mother'spart, consistency is essential when performing fetalmovement counts. Fetal movement counts should bedone at approximately the same time each day, and further testing should be initiated within 12 hours of aclient's perception of decreased activity (Mangesti &Hofmeyr, 2007). Cardiff Technique The woman lies or sits and concentrates on fetal movements until she records 10 movements. She mustrecord the length of time during which the 10 movementsoccurred. She is instructed to notify her health careprovider if she doesn't feel at least 10 movements within1 hour. Further follow-up testing is indicated. Sadovsky Technique The woman lies down on her left side for 1 hour aftermeals and concentrates on fetal movement. Four movements should be felt within 1 hour. If four move-ments have not been felt within 1 hour, then the womanshould monitor movement for a second hour. If after 2 hours four movements haven't been felt, the clientshould contact her health care provider.Nursing Procedure 12.1 MEASURING FETALHEARTRATE Purpose: To assess fetal well-being 1. Assist the woman onto the examining table and have her lie down. 2. Cover her with a sheet to ensure privacy, and then expose her abdomen. 3. Palpate the abdomen to determine the fetal lie, position, and presentation. 4. Locate the back of the fetus (the ideal position to hear the heart rate). 5. Apply lubricant gel to abdomen in the area where the back has been located. 6. Turn on the handheld Doppler device and place it on the spot over the fetal back. 7. Listen for the sound of the amplied heart rate, moving the device slightly from side to side as necessary to obtain the loudest sound. Assess thewoman's pulse rate and compare it to the ampliedsound. If the rates appear the same, reposition theDoppler device. 8. Once the fetal heart rate has been identied, count the number of beats in 1 minute and record the results. 9. Remove the Doppler device and wipe off any remaining gel from the woman's abdomen and the device. 10. Record the heart rate on the woman's medical record. 11. Provide information to the woman regarding fetal well-being based on ndings.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 300CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 301 edema around the eyes, edema of the hands, and pre- tibial edema are abnormal and could be signs of ges-tational hypertension. Inspecting and palpating bothextremities, listening for complaints of tight rings onfingers, and observing for swelling around the eyes areimportant assessments. Abnormal ndings in any of theseareas need to be reported. If the mother is Rh negative, her antibody titer is re-evaluated. RhoGAM is given if indicated. The clientalso is evaluated for risk of preterm labor. At each visit, askif she is experiencing any common signs or symptoms ofpreterm labor (e.g., uterine contractions, dull backache,feeling of pressure in the pelvic area or thighs, increasedvaginal discharge, menstrual-like cramps, vaginal bleed-ing). A pelvic examination is performed to assess the cervixfor position, consistency, length, and dilation. If the womanhas had a previous preterm birth, she is at risk for anotherand close monitoring is warranted. Counsel the woman about choosing a health care provider for the newborn, if she has not selected one yet.Along with completion of a breast assessment, discuss thechoice of breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding. Reinforcethe importance of daily fetal movement monitoring as anindicator of fetal well-being. Re-evaluate hemoglobin andhematocrit levels to assess for anemia. Between 37 and 40 weeks' gestation, the same assess- ments are done as for the previous weeks. In addition,screening for group B streptococcus, gonorrhea, andchlamydia is done. Fetal presentation and position (via Leopold's maneuvers) are assessed. Review the signs andsymptoms of labor and forward a copy of the prenatalrecord to the hospital labor department for future refer-ence. Review the client's desire for family planning afterbirth as well as her decision to breastfeed or bottle-feed.Remind the client that an infant car seat is required by lawand must be used to drive the newborn home from thehospital or birthing center. Teaching About the Danger Signs of Pregnancy It is important to educate the client about danger signs during pregnancy that require further evaluation. Explainthat she should contact her health care provider immedi-ately if she experiences any of the following: During the first trimester: spotting or bleeding (miscarriage), painful urination (infection), severe persistent vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum), feverhigher than 100 \u00b0F (infection), and lower abdominal pain with dizziness and accompanied by shoulder pain(ruptured ectopic pregnancy) During the second trimester: regular uterine contrac- (preterm labor); pain in calf, often increased withfoot flexion (blood clot in deep vein); sudden gush orleakage of fluid from vagina (premature rupture ofmembranes); and absence of fetal movement for more than 24 hours (possible fetal distress or demise) During the third trimester: sudden weight gain; peri- orbital or facial edema, severe upper abdominal pain,or headache with visual changes (pregnancy-inducedhypertension); and a decrease in fetal daily movementfor more than 24 hours (possible demise). Any of theprevious warning signs and symptoms can also bepresent in this last trimester (March of Dimes, 2008c). One of the warning signs that should be emphasized is early contractions, which can lead to preterm birth.All pregnant women need to be able to recognize earlysigns of contractions to prevent preterm labor, which is amajor public health problem in the United States . Approx- imately 12% of all live births\u2014or one out of eight babies\u2014is born too soon (March of Dimes, 2008c). These preterminfants (born at less than 37 weeks' gestation) can sufferlifelong health consequences such as mental retardation,chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, seizure disorders,and blindness, among other problems (March of Dimes,2008c). Preterm labor can happen to any pregnant women at any time. In many cases it can be stopped with med-ications if it is recognized early, before significant cer-vical dilation has taken place. If the woman experiences menstrual-like cramps occurring every 10 minutes accom-panied by a low, dull backache, she should stop what she is doing and lie down on her left side for 1 hour and drinktwo or three glasses of water. If the symptoms worsen ordon't subside after 1 hour, she should contact her healthcare provider. Assessment of Fetal Well-Being During the antepartum period, several tests are performedroutinely to monitor fetal well-being and to detect possi-ble problems. When a high-risk pregnancy is identied,additional antepartum testing can be initiated to promotepositive maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. High- risk pregnancies include those that are complicated by maternal or fetal conditions (coincidental with or uniqueto pregnancy) that jeopardize the health status of themother and put the fetus at risk for uteroplacental insuf- ciency, hypoxia, and death (Gilbert, 2007). However, additional antepartum fetal testing should take place onlywhen the results obtained will guide future care, whether itis reassurance, more frequent testing, admission to the hos-pital, or the need for immediate delivery (Gilbert, 2007). Ultrasonography Since its introduction in the late 1950s, ultrasonography has become a very useful diagnostic tool in obstetrics.Real-time scanners can produce a continuous picture of thefetus on a monitor screen. A transducer that emits high-frequency sound waves is placed on the mother's abdomenand moved to visualize the fetus (Fig. 12.6). The fetal11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 301302 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY heartbeat and any malformations in the fetus can be as- sessed and measurements can be made accurately fromthe picture on the monitor screen. Ultrasound, which is noninvasive, is considered a safe, accurate, and cost-effective tool. It provides importantinformation about fetal activity, growth, and gestationalage, assesses fetal well-being, and determines the need forinvasive intrauterine tests (Valley & Fly, 2006). There are no hard-and-fast rules as to the number of ultrasounds a woman should have during her pregnancy.An ultrasound usually is performed in the rst trimesterto conrm pregnancy, exclude ectopic or molar pregnan-cies, and conrm cardiac pulsation. A second scan may beperformed at about 18 to 20 weeks to look for congenitalmalformations, exclude multifetal pregnancies, and ver-ify dates and growth. A third scan may be done at around34 weeks to evaluate fetal size, assess fetal growth, and ver-ify placental position (Valley & Fly, 2006). An ultrasoundis used to conrm placental location during amniocentesisand to provide visualization during chorionic villus sam-pling. An ultrasound is also ordered whenever an abnor-mality is suspected based on clinical grounds. Nursing management during the ultrasound focuses on educating the woman about the ultrasound test andreassuring her that she will not experience any sensationfrom the sound waves during the test. No special clientpreparation is needed before performing the ultrasound,although in early pregnancy the woman may need to havea full bladder. Inform her that she may experience somediscomfort from the pressure on the full bladder duringthe scan, but it will last only a short time. Tell the clientthat the conducting gel used on the abdomen during thescan may feel cold initially. Doppler Flow Studies Doppler flow studies can be used to measure the veloc-ity of blood flow via ultrasound. Doppler flow studies can detect fetal compromise in high-risk pregnancies. The testis noninvasive and has no contraindications. The color im-ages produced help to identify abnormalities in diastolic flow within the umbilical vessels. The velocity of thefetal red blood cells can be determined by measuringthe change in the frequency of the sound wave reflectedoff the cells. Thus, Doppler flow studies can detect themovement of red blood cells in vessels (Gilbert, 2007).In pregnancies complicated by hypertension or IUGR, di-astolic blood flow may be absent or even reversed (Gilbert, 2007). Doppler flow studies also can be used to evaluatethe blood flow through other fetal blood vessels, suchas the aorta and those in the brain. Research continuesto determine the indications for Doppler flow studies toimprove pregnancy outcomes. Nursing management ofthe woman undergoing Doppler flow studies is similar tothat described for an ultrasound. Alpha-Fetoprotein Analysis Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a substance produced by the fetal liver between weeks 13 and 20 of gestation. About30 years ago, elevated levels of maternal serum AFP or amniotic fluid AFP were first linked to the occur-rence of fetal neural tube defects. This biomarker screen- ing test is now recommended for all pregnant women(Alexander et al., 2007; ACOG, 2007a). AFP is present in amniotic fluid in low concentrations between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation and can be detectedin maternal serum beginning approximately at 12 to 14 weeks of gestation (Gilbert, 2007). If there is a devel- opmental defec t, such as failure of the neural tube to close, more AFP escapes into amniotic fluid from the fetus. AFPthen enters the maternal circulation by crossing the pla-centa, and the level in maternal serum can be measured.The optimal time for AFP screening is 16 to 18 weeks ofgestation (ACOG, 2007a). Correct information about ges-tational dating, maternal weight, race, number of fetuses,and insulin dependency is necessary to ensure the accu-racy of this screening test. If incorrect maternal informa-tion is submitted or the blood specimen is not drawnduring the appropriate time frame, false-positive results A B FIGURE12.6 Ultrasound. ( A) Ultrasound device being applied to client's abdomen. ( B) View of monitor.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 302CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 303 may occur, increasing the woman's anxiety. Subsequently, further testing might be ordered based on an inaccurateinterpretation, resulting in additional nancial and emo-tional costs to the woman. A variety of situations can lead to elevation of mater- nal serum AFP, including open neural tube defect, under-estimation of gestational age, the presence of multiplefetuses, gastrointestinal defects, low birthweight, oligo- hydramnios, &Chan, 2007). Lower-than-expected maternal serum AFPlevels are seen when fetal gestational age is overestimatedor in cases of fetal death, hydatidiform mole, increased ma-ternal weight, maternal type I diabetes, and fetal trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) or trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)(Gilbert, 2007). Measurement of maternal serum AFP is minimally invasive, requiring only a venipuncture for a blood sample.It detects approximately 80% of all open neural tube de-fects and open abdominal wall defects in early pregnancy(Dashe et al., 2006). AFP has now been combined withother biomarker screening tests to determine the risk ofneural tube defects and Down syndrome. Nursing management for AFP testing consists of preparing the woman for this screening test by gathering accurate information about the date of her LMP, weight,race, and gestational dating. Accurately determining thewindow of 16 to 18 weeks' gestation will help to ensurethat the test results are correct. Also explain that the test involves obtaining a blood specimen. Marker Screening Tests Two additional blood screening tests may be used to de-termine the risk of open neural tube defects and Downsyndrome: the triple-marker screen and the addition ofa fourth marker, inhibin A, which is used to enhance theaccuracy of screening for Down syndrome in womenyounger than 35 years of age. Low inhibin A levels indi-cate the possibility of Down syndrome (Frieden & Chan,2007). These tests combine three or four procedures toenhance the ability to make a diagnosis. These biomarkers are merely screening tests and identify women who needfurther definitive procedures (i.e., amniocentesis andgenetic counseling) to make a of neural tubedefects (anencephaly, spina bida, and encephalocele) orDown syndrome in the fetus. Most screening tests areperformed between 15 to 22 weeks of gestation (16 to18 weeks is ideal) (Blackburn, 2007). The triple-marker screening or triple screening test is performed at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation. It uses the lev-els of three maternal serum markers (AFP, unconjugatedestriol, and hCG), in combination with maternal age, tocalculate risk (Frieden & Chan, 2007). With this screen-ing, low maternal serum AFP and unconjugated estriollevels and a high hCG level suggests the possibility ofDown syndrome. Elevated levels of maternal serum AFP are associated with open neural tube defects, ventral walldefects, some renal abnormalities, multiple gestation,certain skin disorders, fetal demise, and placental abnor-mality. The addition of the other two markers enhancesthe detection rate, from 25% using AFP alone to approx-imately 69% using all three (Frieden & Chan, 2007). The screening test using four maternal markers (i.e., quadruple-marker screening) is also used to screen forDown syndrome. It uses maternal age at term and theconcentration of four biomarkers in maternal serum:AFP, unconjugated estriol, hCG, and inhibin A. This testis done at 14 to 22 weeks of pregnancy and is reported todetect 85% of trisomy 21 cases; the triple screen to detect only 69% (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau,2007). AFP and inhibin A levels are decreased in infantswith trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Nursing management related to marker screening tests consists primarily of providing education about the tests.Prenatal screening has become standard in prenatal care.However, for many couples it remains confusing, emotion-ally charged, and lled with uncertain risks. Offer a thor- ough explanation of the test, reinforcing the informationgiven by the health care professional. Provide couples witha description of the risks and benets of performing these screens, emphasizing that these tests are for screening pur-poses only. Remind the couple that a denitive diagnosisis not made without further tests such as an amniocen-tesis. Answer any questions about these prenatal screen-ing tests and respect the couple's decision if they choosenot to have them done. Many couples may choose notto know because they would not consider having an abor-tion regardless of the test results. Nuchal Translucency Screening Nuchal translucency screening (ultrasound) is also done inthe rst trimester between 11 and 14 weeks. This allowsfor earlier detection and diagnosis of some fetal chromo-somal and structural abnormalities. Ultrasound is used toidentify an increase in nuchal translucency, which is dueto the subcutaneous accumulation of thefetal neck. Increased nuchal translucency is associatedwith chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 21, 18,and 13. Infants with trisomies tend to have more collagenand elastic connective tissue, allowing for accumulation(Caughey et al., 2007). Amniocentesis Amniocentesis involves a transabdominal puncture of the amniotic sac to obtain a sample of amniotic fluid foranalysis. The fluid contains fetal cells that are examined todetect chromosomal abnormalities and several hereditarymetabolic defects in the fetus before birth. In addition,amniocentesis is used to conrm a fetal abnormality whenother screening tests detect a possible problem.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:54 PM Page 303304 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Amniocentesis is performed in the second trimester, usually between weeks 16 and 18. It can be done as earlyas week 14 or as late as week 20 (Singh & Singh, 2007).Over 40 different chromosomal abnormalities, inbornerrors of metabolism, and neural tube defects can be diagnosed with amniocentesis. It can replace a geneticprobability with a diagnostic certainty, allowing the womanand her partner to make an informed decision about theoption of therapeutic abortion. Amniocentesis can be performed in any of the three trimesters of pregnancy. An early amniocentesis (per-formed between weeks 11 and 14) is done to detect ge-netic anomalies. However, early amniocentesis has beenassociated with a high risk of ACOG (2004) issued a position state-ment on rst-trimester screening methods, recommend- ing chorionic villus sampling and nuchal translucency to detect Down syndrome rather than amniocentesisbecause of the increased risks associated with the earlyprocedure. However, early screening and diagnosis canprovide the couple with time to make decisions about the pregnancy outcome. In the second trimester the procedure is performed between 15 and 20 weeks to detect chromosomal abnor-malities, evaluate the fetal condition when the woman issensitized to the Rh-positive blood, diagnose intrauterineinfections, and investigate amniotic fluid AFP when thematernal serum AFP level is elevated (Gilbert, 2007). In the third trimester amniocentesis is most com- monly indicated to determine fetal lung maturity afterthe 35th week of gestation via analysis of lecithin-to- sphingomyelin ratios (L/S ratio) and to evaluate the fetalcondition with Rh isoimmunization. Table 12.1 lists am-niotic fluid analysis ndings and their implications. The second trimester is the most common time to have an amniocentesis for any prenatal diagnosis sinceit carries such high risk if done earlier. By week 14 to 16of gestation, there is sufcient amniotic fluid for samplingyet enough time for a safe abortion, if desired. Amniocen-tesis is offered to women who are 35 years of age or older,women who have a child with a neural tube defect, andwomen with elevated maternal serum AFP levels.

Procedure Amniocentesis is performed after an ultrasound exam-ination identifies an adequate pocket of amniotic fluidfree of fetal parts, the umbilical cord, or the placenta(Fig. 12.7). The health care provider inserts a long pu-dendal or spinal needle, a 22-gauge, 5-inch needle, intothe amniotic cavity and aspirates amniotic fluid, whichis placed in an amber or foil-covered test tube to pro-tect it from light. When the desired amount of fluid hasbeen withdrawn, the needle is removed and slight pres-sure is applied to the site. If there is no evidence of bleed-ing, a sterile bandage is applied to the needle site. The specimens are then sent to the laboratory immediatelyfor the cytologist to evaluate. Examining a sample of fetal cells directly produces a definitive diagnosis rather than a \"best guess\" diagno-sis based on indirect screening tests. It is an invaluablediagnostic tool, but the risks include spontaneous abor-tion (1 in 200), maternal or fetal infection, fetal-maternal hemorrhage, leakage of amniotic fluid, and maternal dis- comfort after the procedure. The test results may takeup to 3 weeks. Nursing Management When preparing the woman for an amniocentesis, explainthe procedure and encourage her to empty her bladder justbefore the procedure to avoid the risk of bladder puncture.Inform her that a 20-minute electronic fetal monitoring strip usually is obtained to evaluate fetal well-being andobtain a baseline to compare after the procedure is com-pleted. Obtain and record maternal vital signs. After the procedure, assist the woman to a position of comfort and administer RhoGAM intramuscularly ifthe woman is Rh negative to prevent potential sensi-tization to fetal blood. Assess maternal vital signs andfetal heart rate every 15 minutes for an hour after theprocedure. Observe the puncture site for bleeding ordrainage. Instruct the client to rest after returning homeand remind her to report fever, leaking amniotic fluid,vaginal bleeding, or uterine contractions or any changesin fetal activity (increased or decreased) to the healthcare provider. When the test results come back, be available to offer support, especially if a fetal abnormality is found. Alsoprepare the woman and her partner for the need for ge-netic counseling. Trained genetic counselors can provideaccurate medical information and help couples to inter-pret the results of the amniocentesis so they can make thedecisions that are right for them as a family. Chorionic Villus Sampling Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a procedure for obtaining a sample of the chorionic villi for prenatal eval-uation of chr omosomal disorders, enzyme deficiencies, and fetal gender determination and to identify sex-linkeddisorders such as hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, and Tay-Sachs disease (Blackburn, 2007). Chorionic villi are nger-like projections that cover the embryo and anchor it to theuterine lining before the placenta is developed. Becausethey are of embryonic origin, sampling provides infor-mation about the developing fetus. CVS can be used todetect numerous genetic disorders, with the exception ofneural tube defects (Jenkins et al., 2007). There has been an impetus to develop earlier pre- natal diagnostic procedures so that couples can make anearly decision to terminate the pregnancy if an anomalyis confirmed. Early prenatal diagnosis by CVS was pro-posed as an alternative to routine amniocentesis, which carries fewer risks if done later in the pregnancy. In addi-tion, results of CVS testing are available sooner than thoseof amniocentesis, usually within 48 hours. Procedure CVS is generally performed 10 to 13 weeks after the LMP. Earlier, chorionic villi may not be sufciently developedfor adequate tissue sampling and the risk of limb defectsis increased (Kenner & Lott, 2007). First, an ultrasound isdone to conrm gestational age and viability. Then, undercontinuous ultrasound guidance, CVS is performed using either a transcervical or transabdominal approach. Withthe transcervical approach, the woman is placed in thelithotomy position and a sterile catheter is introduced FIGURE12.7 Technique for amniocentesis: Inserting needle. 11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 305306 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY through the cervix and inserted in the placenta, where a sample of chorionic villi is aspirated. This approach re-quires the client to have a full bladder to push the uterusand placenta into a position that is more accessible to thecatheter. A full bladder also helps in better visualizationof the structures. With the transabdominal approach, an18-gauge spinal needle is inserted through the abdominalwall into the placental tissue and a sample of chorionic villiis aspirated. Regardless of the approach used, the sampleis sent to the cytogenetics laboratory for analysis. Potential complications of CVS include mild vaginal bleeding and cramping, spontaneous abortion, limb abnor-malities, rupture of membranes, infection, chorioamnioni-tis,and fetal-maternal hemorrhage (Blackburn, 2007). The pregnancy loss rate is approximately 1.3%, whichis somewhat higher than with traditional amniocentesis(Walling, 2007). In addition, women who are Rh negativeshould receive immune globulin (RhoGAM) to avoid iso-immunization (Gilbert, 2007). Nursing Management Explain to the woman that the procedure will last about 15 minutes. An ultrasound will be done first to locatethe embryo, and a baseline set of vital signs will be takenbefore starting. Make sure she is informed of the risks re-lated to the procedure, including their incidence. If a transabdominal CVS procedure is planned, ad- vise her to ll her bladder by drinking increased amountsof water. Inform her that a needle will be inserted throughher abdominal wall and samples will be collected. Oncethe samples are collected, the needle will be withdrawnand the samples will be sent to the genetics laboratory forevaluation. For transcervical CVS, inform the women that a speculum will be placed into the vagina under ultra-sound guidance. Then the vagina is cleaned and a small catheter is inserted through the cervix. The sam-ples obtained through the catheter are then sent to thelaboratory. After either procedure, assist the woman to a position of comfort and clean any excess lubricant or secretionsfrom the area. Instruct her about signs to watch for andreport, such as fever, cramping, and vaginal bleeding. Urge her not to engage in any strenuous activity for thenext 48 hours. Assess the fetal heart rate for changes andadminister RhoGAM to an unsensitized Rh-negativewoman after the procedure. Percutaneous Umbilical Blood Sampling Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) permits the collection of a blood specimen directly from the fetalcirculation (Fig. 12.8). This test allows for rapid chromo-somal analysis to achieve a timely diagnosis. It is done specically for women at risk for genetic anomalies and those with potential blood disorders, such as blood in- compatibility or hemoglobinopathies. Procedure Under continuous ultrasound guidance, a ne needle is in- serted through the mother's abdomen and uterine wall intoan umbilical cord vessel. Specimens can be evaluated forcoagulation studies, blood group typing, complete bloodcount, karyotyping, and blood gas analysis (Singh & Singh,2008). Fetal infection, Rh incompatibility, and fetal acid-base status can be determined. The blood sample is usuallydrawn late in the second trimester to assist in medical man-agement, but PUBS can be done anytime after 16 weeks of gestation. Although the information gained from this procedure is valuable and can be life-saving for many fetuses, PUBSis not without risks. Potential complications include leak-age of blood from the puncture site, cord laceration, cordhematomas, transient fetal bradycardia, infection, throm- boembolism in the cord, preterm labor, infection,and premature rupture of membranes (Blackburn, 2007). Nursing Management Explain the procedure thoroughly to the woman. Positionher properly on the examination table and help clean thearea for needle insertion. Monitor vital signs and fetalheart rate throughout the procedure. At the conclusionof the procedure, closely monitor the mother and fetusfor changes. Assess fetal heart rate continuously and per-form external fetal monitoring for up to 2 hours before thewoman is discharged from the outpatient area. A repeatultrasound is usually done within an hour after the proce-dure to rule out bleeding or hematoma formation. Prior to discharge, instruct the woman to report signs of infection, an increase in contractions, or a change in fetal FIGURE12.8 Collecting blood sample for PUBS.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 306CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 307 activity level from normal. Reinforce the need to count fetal movements, and review the technique so she can assessthem when she is discharged home. Nonstress Test The nonstress test (NST) is an indirect measurement of uteroplacental function. Unlike the fetal movementcounting done by the mother alone, this procedure re-quires specialized equipment and trained personnel.The basis for the nonstress test is that the normal fetusproduces characteristic fetal heart rate patterns in re-sponse to fetal movements. In the healthy fetus there isan acceleration of the fetal heart rate with fetal move-ment. Currently, an NST is recommended twice weekly (after 28 weeks of gestation) for clients with diabetes andother high-risk conditions, such as IUGR, preeclampsia,postterm pregnancy, renal disease, and multifetal preg-nancies (Cunningham et al., 2005). NST is a noninvasive test that requires no initiation of contractions. It is quick to perform and there are no knownside effects. However, it is not as sensitive to fetal oxygenreserves as the contraction stress test, and there is a highfalse-positive rate (Gilbert, 2007). Procedure Before the procedure the client eats a meal to stimulatefetal activity. Then she is placed in the left lateral recum-bent position to avoid supine hypotension syndrome. Anexternal electronic fetal monitoring device is applied toher abdomen. The device consists of two belts, each witha sensor. One of the sensors records uterine activity; thesecond sensor records fetal heart rate. The client ishanded an \"event marker\" with a button that she pushesevery time she perceives fetal movement. When the but-ton is pushed, the fetal monitor strip is marked to iden-tify that fetal movement has occurred. The procedureusually lasts 20 to 30 minutes. Nursing Management Prior to the NST, explain the testing procedure and have the woman empty her bladder. Position her in a semi- Fowler's position and apply the two external monitor belts.Document the date and time the test is started, patientinformation, the reason for the test, and the maternalvital signs. Obtain a baseline fetal monitor strip over 15 to 30 minutes. During the test, observe for signs of fetal activity with a concurrent acceleration of the fetal heart rate. Interpretthe NST as reactive or nonreactive. A \"reactive\" NSTincludes at least two fetal heart rate accelerations from thebaseline of at least 15 bpm for at least 15 seconds withinthe 20-minute recording period. If the test does not meetthese criteria after 40 minutes, it is considered nonreactive.A \"nonreactive\" NST is characterized by the absence oftwo fetal heart rate accelerations using the 15-by-15 cri-terion in a 20-minute time frame. A nonreactive test has been correlated with a higher incidence of fetal distressduring labor, fetal mortality, and IUGR. Additional test-ing, such as a contraction stress test or biophysical prole,should be considered (Frieden & Chan, 2007). After the NST procedure, assist the woman off the table, provide her with fluids, and allow her to use the rest-room. Typically the results are discussed with the womanat this time by the health care provider. Provide teachingabout signs and symptoms to report. If serial NSTs arebeing done, schedule the next testing session. Contraction Stress Test Because blood flow to the uterus and placenta is slowedduring uterine contractions, the contraction stress test(CST), formerly called the oxytocin-challenge test, is a di-agnostic procedure performed to determine the fetal heartrate response under stress, such as during contractions.The goal of the test is to achieve three uterine contrac-tions in a 10-minute period. This can occur spontaneously with the aid of nipple stimulation, which causes the re- lease of endogenous oxytocin, or through the use of anoxytocin infusion. Its use has been indicated in preg-nancies in placental insufficiency stillbirth\u2014or when an irregularity of the fetal heart rate has been observed. However, the CST hasgiven way to the biophysical prole 2007). Biophysical Prole A biophysical profile uses a real-time ultrasound to allow assessment of various parameters of fetal well-being: fetal tone, breathing, motion, and amniotic fluid volume.These four parameters, together with the NST, constitutethe biophysical profile. Each parameter is controlled bya different structure in the fetal brain: fetal tone by thecortex; fetal movements by the cortex and motor nuclei;fetal breathing movements by the centers close to the fourthventricle; and the NST by the posterior hypothalamusand medulla. The amniotic fluid is the result of fetal urinevolume. Not all facilities perform an NST unless otherparameters of the profile are abnormal (Gilbert, 2007).The biophysical prole is based on the concept that a fetusthat experiences hypoxia loses certain behavioral param- eters in the reverse order in which they were acquired dur-ing fetal development (normal order of development: toneat 8 weeks; movement at 9 weeks; breathing at 20 weeks;and fetal heart rate reactivity at 24 weeks). Scoring and Interpretation The biophysical prole is a scored test with ve compo- nents, each worth 2 points if present. A total score of 10 is11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 307308 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY possible if the NST is used. Thirty minutes are allotted for testing, although fewer than 10 minutes are usuallyneeded. The following criteria must be met to obtain ascore of 2; anything less is scored as 0 (Gilbert, 2007): Body movements: three or more discrete limb or trunk movements Fetal tone: one or more instances of full extension and flexion of a limb or trunk Fetal breathing: one or more fetal breathing movements of more than 30 seconds Amniotic fluid volume: one or more pockets of fluid measuring 2 cm NST: normal NST =2 points; abnormal NST =0 points Interpretation of the biophysical profile score can be complicated, depending on several fetal and maternalvariables. Because it is indicated as a result of a non-reassuring finding from previous fetal surveillance tests,this test can be used to quantify the interpretation, andintervention can be initiated if appropriate. One of theimportant factors is the amniotic fluid volume, taken inconjunction with the results of the NST. Amniotic fluidis largely composed of fetal urine. As placental functiondecreases, perfusion of fetal organs, such as kidneys, de-creases, and this can lead to a reduction of amniotic fluid.If oligohydramnios or decreased amniotic fluid antepartum or intrapartum fetalcompromise (Gearhart & Sehdev, 2007). Overall, a score of 8 to 10 is considered normal if the amniotic fluid volume is adequate. A score of 6 or belowis suspicious, possibly indicating a compromised fetus;further investigation of fetal well-being is needed. Because the biophysical prole is an ultrasonographic assessment of fetal behavior, it requires more extensiveequipment and more highly trained personnel than othertesting modalities. The cost is much greater than with lesssophisticated tests. It permits conservative therapy andprevents premature or unnecessary intervention. Thereare fewer false-positive results than with the NST aloneor CST (Gearhart & Sehdev, 2007). Nursing Management Nursing management focuses primarily on offering the client support and answering her questions. Expect tocomplete the NST before scheduling the biophysical pro-le, and explain why further testing might be needed. Tellthe woman that the ultrasound will be done in the diag-nostic imaging department. Nursing Management for the Common Discomforts of Pregnancy Most women experience common discomforts during pregnancy and ask a nurse's advice about ways to minimizethem. However, other women will not bring up their con- cerns unless asked. Therefore, the nurse needs to addressthe common discomforts that occur in each trime ster at each prenatal visit and provide realistic measures to helpthe client deal with them (Teaching Guidelines 12.1).Nursing Care Plan 12.1 applies the nursing process tothe care of a woman experiencing some discomforts ofpregnancy. First-Trimester Discomforts During the first 3 months of pregnancy, the woman's body is undergoing numerous changes. Some womenexperience m any discomforts, but others have few. These discomforts are caused by the changes taking place withinthe body and pass as the pregnancy progresses. Urinary Frequency or Incontinence Urinary frequency or incontinence is common in thefirst trimester because the growing uterus compressesthe bladder. This also is a common complaint duringthe third trimester, especially when the fetal head settlesinto the pelvis. However, the discomfort tends to im-prove in the second trimester, when the uterus becomesan abdominal organ and moves away from the bladderregion. After infection and gestational diabetes have been ruled out as causative factors of increased urinary fre-quency, suggest that the woman decrease her fluid in-take 2 to 3 hours before bedtime and limit her intake ofcaffeinated beverages. Increased voiding is normal, butencourage the client to report any pain or burning duringurination. Also explain that increased urinary frequencymay subside as she enters her second trimester, only torecur in the third trimester. Teach the client to performKegel exercises throughout the day to help strengthen perineal muscle tone, thereby enhancing urinary controland decreasing the possibility of incontinence. Fatigue Fatigue plagues all pregnant women, primarily in the rstand third trimesters (the highest energy levels typicallyoccur during the second trimester), even if they get theirnormal amount of sleep at night. First-trimester fatiguemost often is related to the many physical changes (e.g.,increased oxygen consumption, increased levels of pro-gesterone and relaxin, increased metabolic demands) andpsychosocial changes (e.g., mood swings, multiple roledemands) of pregnancy. Third-trimester fatigue can becaused by sleep disturbances from increased weight (manywomen cannot nd a comfortable sleeping position dueto the enlarging abdomen), physical discomforts such asheartburn, and insomnia due to mood swings, multiplerole anxiety, and a decrease in exercise (Trupin, 2006). Once anemia, infection, and blood dyscrasias have been ruled out as contributing to the client's fatigue, advise11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 308CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 309 her to arrange work, childcare, and other demands in her life to permit additional rest periods. Work with the clientto devise a realistic schedule for rest. Using pillows for sup-port in the side-lying position relieves pressure on major blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the fetuswhen resting (Fig. 12.9). Also recommend the use of re-laxation techniques, providing instructions as necessary,and suggest she increase her daily exercise level.Nausea and Vomiting Nausea and vomiting are common discomforts during the rst trimester: at least 50% of women experience nauseaduring pregnancy (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007).The physiologic changes that cause nausea and vomit-ing are unknown, but research suggests that unusuallyhigh levels of estrogen, progesterone, and hCG and avitamin B6 deciency may be contributing factors. Symp-Urinary Frequency or Incontinence Try Kegel exercises to increase control over leakage. Empty your bladder when you rst feel a full sensation. Avoid caffeinated drinks, which stimulate voiding. Reduce your fluid intake after dinner to reduce nighttime urination. Fatigue Attempt to get a full night's sleep, without interruptions. Eat a healthy balanced diet. Schedule a nap in the early afternoon daily. When you are feeling tired, rest. Nausea and Vomiting Avoid an empty stomach at all times. Munch on dry crackers/toast in bed before arising. Eat several small meals throughout the day. Drink fluids between meals rather than with meals. Avoid greasy, fried foods or ones with a strong odor, such as cabbage or Brussels sprouts. Backache Avoid standing or sitting in one position for long periods. Apply heating pad (low setting) to the small of your back. Support your lower back with pillows when sitting. Stand with your shoulders back to maintain correct posture. Leg Cramps Elevate legs above heart level frequently throughout the day. If you get a cramp, straighten both legs and flex your feet toward your body. Ask your health care provider about taking additional calcium supplements, which may reduceleg spasms.Varicosities Walk daily to improve circulation to extremities. Elevate both legs above heart level while resting. Avoid standing in one position for long periods of time. Don't wear constrictive stockings and socks. Don't cross the legs when sitting for long periods. Wear support stockings to promote better circulation. Hemorrhoids Establish a regular time for daily bowel elimination. Prevent straining by drinking plenty of fluids and eating ber-rich foods and exercising daily. Use warm sitz baths and cool witch hazel compresses for comfort. Constipation Increase your intake of foods high in ber and drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid daily. Exercise each day (brisk walking) to promote movement through the intestine. Reduce the amount of cheese consumed. Heartburn/Indigestion Avoid spicy or greasy foods and eat small frequent meals. Sleep on several pillows so that your head is elevated. Stop smoking and avoid caffeinated drinks to reduce stimulation. Avoid lying down for at least 2 hours after meals. Try drinking sips of water to reduce burning sensation. Take antacids sparingly if burning sensation is severe. Braxton Hicks Contractions Keep in mind that these contractions are a normal sensation. Try changing your position or engaging in mild exercise to help reduce the sensation. Drink more fluids if possible.TEACHING GUIDELINES 12.1 Teaching to Manage the Discomforts of Pregnancy11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 309310 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Nursing Care Plan 12.1 OVERVIEW OF THE WOMAN EXPERIENCING COMMON DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY Alicia, a 32-year-old, G1 P0, at 10 weeks' gestation, comes to the clinic for a visit. During the interview she tells you, \"I'm running to the bathroom to urinate it seems like all the time, and I'm so nauseous that I'm having trouble eating.\" She denies any burning or pain on urination. Vital signs are within acceptable limits. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired urinary elimination related to frequency secondary to physiologic changes of pregnancy Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will report a decrease in urinary complaints, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of times she uses the bathroom to void, reports that she feels her bladder is empty after voiding, and use of Kegel exercises. Interventions: Promoting Normal Urinary Elimination Patterns Assess client's usual bladder elimination patterns to establish a baseline for comparison. Obtain a urine specimen for analysis to rule out infection or glucosuria. Review with client the physiologic basis for the increased frequency during pregnancy; inform client that frequency should abate during the second trimester and that it most likely will return during her third trimester. This will promoteunderstanding of the problem. Encourage the client to empty her bladder when rst feeling a sensation of fullness to minimize risk of urinary retention. Suggest client avoid caffeinated drinks, which can stimulate the need to void. Encourage client to drink adequate amounts of fluid throughout the day; however, have client reduce her fluid intake before bedtime to reduce nighttime urination. Urge client to keep perineal area clean and dry to prevent irritation and excoriation from any leakage. Instruct client in Kegel exercises to increase perineal muscle tone and control over leakage. Teach client about the signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection and urge her to report them should they occur toensure early detection and prompt intervention. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to nausea and vomiting Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will ingest adequate amounts of nutrients for maternal and fetal well-being as evidenced by acceptable weight gain pattern and statements indicating an increase in food intake with a decrease in the number of episodes of nausea and vomiting. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Nutrition Obtain weight and compare to baseline to determine effects of nausea and vomiting on nutritional intake. Review client's typical dietary intake over 24 hours to determine nutritional intake and patterns so that suggestions can be individualized. Encourage client to eat ve or six small frequent meals throughout the day to prevent her stomach from becoming empty. Suggest that she munch on dry crackers, toast, cereal, or cheese or drink a small amount of lemonade before arising tominimize nausea. Encourage client to arise slowly from bed in the morning and avoid sudden movements to reduce stimulation of thevomiting center. Advise client to drink fluids between meals rather than with meals to avoid overdistention of the abdomen and subsequentincrease in abdominal pressure. Encourage her to increase her intake of foods high in vitamin B6 such as meat, poultry, bananas, sh, green leafy vegetables, peanuts, raisins, walnuts, and whole grains, as tolerated, to ensure adequate nutrient intake. Advise the client to avoid greasy, fried, or highly spiced foods and to avoid strong odors, including foods such as cabbage,to minimize gastrointestinal upset. Encourage the client to avoid wearing tight or restricting clothes to minimize pressure on the expanding abdomen. Arrange for consultation with nutritionist as necessary to assist with diet planning.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 310CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 311 toms generally last until the second trimester and are generally associated with a positive pregnancy outcome(Cunningham et al., 2005). To help alleviate nausea and vomiting, advise the woman to eat small, frequent meals (five or six a day) toprevent her stomach from becoming completely empty.Other helpful suggestions include eating dry crackers,Cheerios, lemonade, or cheese before getting out of bedin the morning and increasing her intake of foods high invitamin B6, such as meat, poultry, bananas, fish, greenleafy vegetables, peanuts, raisins, walnuts, and wholegrains, or making sure she is receiving enough vitamin B6 by taking her prescribed prenatal vitamins. Other helpfultips to deal with nausea and vomiting include: Get out of bed in the morning very slowly. Avoid sudden movements. Open a window to remove odors of food being cooked. Limit intake of fluids or soups during meals (drink them between meals). Avoid fried foods and foods cooked with grease, oils, or fatty meats, for they tend to upset the stomach. Avoid highly seasoned foods such as those cooked with garlic, onions, peppers, and chili. Drink a small amount of caffeine-free carbonated beverage (ginger ale) if nauseated. Avoid strong smells. Avoid wearing tight or restricting clothes, which might place increased pressure on the expanding abdomen. Avoid stress (Lane, 2007). Breast Tenderness Due to increased estrogen and progesterone levels, whichcause the fat layer of breasts to thicken and the number ofmilk ducts and glands to increase during the rst trimester,many women experience breast tenderness. Offering athorough explanation to the woman about the reasonsfor the breast discomfort is important. Wearing a largerbra with good support can help alleviate this discomfort.Advise her to wear a supportive bra, even while sleeping. As her breasts increase in size, advise her to change her brasize to ensure adequate support. Constipation Increasing levels of progesterone during pregnancy lead to decreased contractility of the gastrointestinal tract,slowed movement of substances through the colon, and a resulting increase in water absorption. All of these fac-tors lead to constipation. Lack of exercise or too little beror fluids in the diet can also promote constipation. Inaddition, the large bowel is mechanically compressed bythe enlarging uterus, adding to this discomfort. The ironand calcium in prenatal vitamins can also contribute toconstipation during the rst and third trimesters. Explain how pregnancy exacerbates the symptoms of constipation and offer the following suggestions: Eat fresh or dried fruit daily. Eat more raw fruits and vegetables, including their skins. Eat whole-grain cereals and breads such as raisin bran or bran flakes. Participate in physical activity every day. Eat meals at regular intervals. Establish a time of day to defecate, and elevate your feet on a stool to avoid straining. Drink six to eight glasses of water daily. Decrease your intake of rened carbohydrates. Drink warm fluids on arising to stimulate bowel motility. Decrease your consumption of sugary sodas. Avoid eating large amounts of cheese. If the suggestions above are ineffective, suggest that the woman use a bulk-forming laxative such as Metamucil. Nasal Stufness, Bleeding Gums, Epistaxis levels of the membranes of the nasal and oral cavities. Advise thewoman to drink extra water for hydration of the mucousmembranes or to use a cool mist humidier in her bedroomat night. If she needs to blow her nose to relieve nasal stuf-ness, advise her to blow gently, one nostril at a time. Adviseher to avoid the use of nasal decongestants and sprays. If a nosebleed occurs, advise the woman to loosen the clothing around her neck, sit with her head tilted for-ward, pinch her nostrils with her thumb and forengerfor 10 to 15 minutes, and apply an ice pack to the bridgeof her nose. If the woman has bleeding gums, encourage her to practice good oral hygiene by using a soft toothbrush andflossing daily. Warm saline mouthwashes can relieve dis-comfort. If the gum problem persists, instruct her to seeher dentist. Cravings Desires for certain foods and beverages are likely to beginduring the rst trimester but do not appear to reflect any FIGURE12.9 Using pillows for support in the side-lying position.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 311312 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY physiologic need. Foods with a high sodium or sugar con- tent often are the ones craved. At times, some women crave non-food substances such as clay, cornstarch, laun-dry detergent, baking soda, soap, paint chips, dirt, ice, or wax. This craving for non-food substances, termed pica,may indicate a severe dietary deficiency of minerals orvitamins, or it may have cultural roots (Lynch, 2007).Pica is discussed in Chapter 11. Leukorrhea Increased vaginal discharge begins during the first tri- mester and continues throughout pregnancy. The phy-siologic changes behind leukorrhea arise from the highlevels of estrogen, which cause increased vascularityand hypertrophy of cervical glands as well as vaginal cells(Cunningham et al., 2005). The result is progressive vagi-nal secretions throughout pregnancy. Advise the woman to keep the perineal area clean and dry, washing the area with mild soap and water dur-ing her daily shower. Also recommend that she avoidwearing pantyhose and other tight-fitting nylon clothesthat prevent air from circulating to the genital area. En- courage the use of cotton underwear and suggest wearinga nightgown rather than pajamas to allow for increasedairflow. Also instruct the woman to avoid douching andtampon use. Second-Trimester Discomforts A sense of well-being typically characterizes the secondtrimester for most women. By this time, the fatigue, nau-sea, and vomiting have subsided and the uncomfortablechanges of the third trimester are a few months away. Notevery woman experiences the same discomforts during thistime, so nursing assessments and interventions must beindividualized. Backache Backache, experienced by many women during the secondtrimester, is due to a shift in the center of gravity causedby the enlarging uterus. Muscle strain results. In addi-tion, a high level of circulating progesterone softens car- tilage and loosens joints, thus increasing discomfort. Upper back pain also can be caused by increased breastsize (ACOG, 2007b). After exploring other reasons that might cause back- ache, such as uterine contractions, urinary tract infection,ulcers, or musculoskeletal back disorders, the followinginstructions may be helpful: Maintain correct posture, with head up and shoulders back. Wear low-heeled shoes with good arch support. When standing for long periods, place one foot on a stool or box. Use good body mechanics when lifting objects. When sitting, use foot supports and pillows behind the back. Try pelvic tilt or rocking exercises to strengthen the back (ACOG, 2007b). The pelvic tilt or pelvic rock is used to alleviate pres- sure on the lower back during pregnancy by stretching thelower back muscles. It can be done sitting, standing, or onall fours. To do it on all fours, the hands are positioned di-rectly under the shoulders and the knees under the hips.The back should be in a neutral position with the headand neck aligned with the straight back. The woman thenpresses up with the lower back and holds this position for afew seconds, then relaxes to a neutral position. This actionof pressing upward is repeated frequently throughout the day to prevent a sore back (ACOG, 2007b). SeeEvidence-Based Practice 12.1. Leg Cramps Leg cramps occur primarily in the second and third trimesters and could be related to the pressure of the graviduterus on pelvic nerves and blood vessels (Arenson &Drake, 2007). Diet can also be a contributing factor ifthe woman is not consuming enough of certain minerals,such as calcium and magnesium. The sudden stretchingof leg muscles may also play a role in causing leg cramps(Trupin, 2006). Encourage the woman to gently stretch the muscle by dorsiflexing the foot up toward the body. Wrappinga warm, moist towel around the leg muscle can also helpthe muscle to relax. Advise the client to avoid stretchingher legs, pointing her toes, and walking excessively. Stressthe importance of wearing low-heeled shoes and supporthose and arising slowly from a sitting position. If the legcramps are due to deciencies in minerals, the conditioncan be remedied by eating more foods rich in these nutri-ents. Also instruct the woman on calf-stretching exercises:have her stand 3 feet from the wall and lean toward it,resting her lower arms against it, while keeping her heelson the floor. This may help reduce cramping if it is donebefore going to bed. Elevating the legs throughout the day will help relieve pressure and minimize strain. Wearing support hose andavoiding curling the toes may help to relieve leg dis-comfort. Also instruct the client to avoid standing in one spot for a prolonged period or crossing her legs. If she must stand for prolonged periods, suggest that she change herposition at least every 2 hours by walking or sitting to re-duce the risk of leg cramps. Encourage her to drink eight8-ounce glasses of fluid throughout the day to ensure ade-quate hydration. Varicosities of the Vulva and Legs Varicosities of the vulva and legs are associated with the in- creased venous stasis caused by the pressure of the graviduterus on pelvic vessels and the vasodilation resulting fromincreased progesterone levels. Progesterone relaxes the veinwalls, making it difficult for blood to return to the heartfrom the extremities; pooling can result. Genetic predispo-11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 312CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 313 sition, inactivity, obesity, and poor muscle tone are con- tributing factors. Encourage the client to wear support hose and teach her how to apply them properly. Advise her to elevate herlegs above her heart while lying on her back for 10 minutesbefore she gets out of bed in the morning, thus promot-ing venous return before she applies the hose. Instruct theclient to avoid crossing her legs and avoid wearing knee-high stockings. They cause constriction of leg vessels andmuscles and contribute to venous stasis. Also encouragethe client to elevate both legs above the level of the heartfor 5 to 10 minutes at least twice a day (Fig. 12.10); to wearlow-heeled shoes; and to avoid long periods of standingor sitting, frequently changing her position. If the client hasvulvar varicosities, suggest she apply ice packs to the areawhen she is lying down. See Evidence-Based Practice 12.2. Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are varicosities of the rectum and may beexternal or internal They a result ofprogesterone-induced vasodilation and from pressure ofthe enlarged uterus on the lower intestine and rectum.Hemorrhoids are more common in women with consti- pation, poor fluid intake or poor dietary habits, smokers,or those with a previous history of hemorrhoids (Arenson& Drake, 2007). Instruct the client in measures to prevent constipa- tion, including increasing fiber intake and drinking atleast 2 liters of fluid per day. Recommend the use of top-ical anesthetics (e.g., Preparation H, Anusol, witch hazelcompresses) to reduce pain, itching, and swelling, if per-mitted by the health care provider. Teach the client aboutlocal comfort measures such as warm sitz baths, witchhazel compresses, or cold compresses. To minimize herrisk of straining while defecating, suggest that she elevate her feet on a stool. Also encourage her to avoid prolongedsitting or standing (ACOG, 2007d). Flatulence With Bloating duced gastrointestinal motility and dilation secondary toprogesterone's influence) also in increasedflatulence. As the enlarging uterus compresses the bowel,it delays the passage of food through the intestines, thusallowing more time for gas to be formed by bacteria inStudy More than two thirds of pregnant women experience back pain and almost one fifth experience pelvic pain. Thepain increases with advancing pregnancy and interfereswith work, daily activities, and sleep. Many women experience back or pelvic pain during pregnancy. Thispain generally increases as pregnancy advances and itinterferes with daily activities (like carrying, cleaning, sitting, and walking), can prevent women from going to work, and sometimes disturbs sleep. Suggestions tohelp manage the pain are varied and include specialpregnancy exercises, frequent rest, hot and cold compresses, a supportive belt, massage, acupuncture,chiropractic, aromatherapy, relaxation, herbs, yoga, andReiki. Sometimes drugs like acetaminophen have alsobeen suggested. No studies were found dealing with theprevention of back and pelvic pain. For treatment, the review of trials found eight studies, involving 1,305 participants, that examined the effects ofvarious pregnancy-specic exercises, physiotherapy programs, acupuncture, and using special pillows addedto usual prenatal care. They were compared to usualpreg nancy care or other treatments. The quality of the studies was not the best, and so the ndings should betreated with caution. Findings The review found that specically tailored strengtheningexercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercise programs, and watergymnastics all reported benecial effects. In addition,acupuncture seemed more effective than physiotherapy.Adverse effects, when reported, appeared minor and transient. More research is needed on this widespreadproblem of pregnancy. Nursing Implications Nurses can apply these ndings to help pregnant womencope with and actively participate in their therapy to relievetheir pelvic and back discomfort. The nurse should offera thorough explanation of the reasons for the discomfort andthen proceed to outline the effective therapies. In addition,the nurse can provide instruction and demonstrate how togo through each exercise.

The woman usually reports increased passage of rectal gas, abdominal bloating, or belching. Instructthe woman to avoid gas-forming foods, such as beans,cabbage, and onions, as well as foods that have a high con-tent of white sugar. Adding more ber to the diet, increas-ing fluid intake, and increasing physical exercise are alsohelpful in reducing flatus. In addition, reducing the swal-lowing of air when chewing gum or smoking will reducegas build-up. Reducing the intake of carbonated beveragesand cheese and eating mints can also help reduce flatu-lence during pregnancy (Trupin, 2006). Third-Trimester Discomforts As women enter their third trimester, many experience a return of the first-trimester discomforts of fatigue,urinary frequency, leukorrhea, and constipation. Thesediscomforts are to the ever-enlarging uteruscompressing adjacent structures, increasing hormone FIGURE12.10 Woman elevating her legs while working. Study Pregnancy is presumed to be a major contributory factor in the increased incidence of varicose veins in women, whichcan in turn lead to venous insufciency and leg edema.The most common symptom of varicose veins and edemais substantial pain, as well as night cramps, numbness,and tingling; also, the legs may feel heavy and achy andthe veins may be unsightly. Varicose veins, sometimes called varicosity, occur when a valve in the blood vessel walls weakens and the bloodstagnates. This leads to problems with the circulation in the veins and to edema or swelling. The vein then becomes distended and its walls stretch and sag, allowingthe vein to swell into a tiny balloon near the surface of theskin. The veins in the legs are most commonly affected as they are working against gravity, but the vulva (vaginalopening) or rectum, resulting in hemorrhoids (piles), can beaffected too. Treatment of varicose veins is usually divided into three main groups: surgery, pharmacological, and non-pharmacologicaltreatments. Treatment for leg edema mostly involvessymptom reduction rather than cure and uses pharmaco-logical and non-pharmacological approaches. The review identied three trials involving 159 women. Although the drug rutoside seemed to be effective in reducing symptoms, the study was too small to be able to say this with real condence. Similarly, with compressionstockings and reflexology, there were insufcient data tobe able to assess benets and harms, but they lookedpromising. More research is needed. Findings Rutoside appears to relieve the symptoms of varicoseveins in late pregnancy. However, this nding is based onone small study (69 women), and there are not enough datapresented in the study to assess its safety in pregnancy. It therefore cannot be routinely recommended. Reflexologyappears to improve symptoms for women with leg edema,but again this is based on one small study (43 women). External compression stockings do not appear to have anyadvantages in reducing edema. Nursing Implications Nurses can use this evidence to instruct women aboutvaricose veins and outline the various therapies availableto treat them. It is not clear that any of the therapies are totally successful in relieving the discomfort associatedwith varicose veins, based on this analysis, but comforttherapies can be covered to help with the discomfort.Maintaining an ideal weight gain throughout the pregnancywill also help reduce the risk of varicose vein formation.

In addi- tion to these discomforts, many women experience short-ness of breath, heartburn and indigestion, swelling, andBraxton Hicks contractions. Shortness of Breath and Dyspnea The increasing growth of the uterus prevents complete lung expansion late in pregnancy. As the uterus enlargesupward, the expansion of the diaphragm is limited. Dysp-nea can occur when the woman lies on her back and thepressure of the gravid uterus against the vena cava reducesvenous return to the heart (Arenson & Drake, 2007). Explain to the woman that dyspnea is normal and will improve when the fetus drops into the pelvis (lightening).Instruct her to adjust her body position to allow for max-imum expansion of the chest and to avoid large meals,which increase abdominal pressure. Raising the head ofthe bed on blocks or placing pillows behind her back ishelpful too. In addition, stress that lying on her side will dis-place the uterus off the vena cava and improve her breath-ing. Advise the woman to avoid exercise that precipitatesdyspnea, to rest after exercise, and to avoid overheatingin warm climates. If she still smokes, encourage her tostop. Heartburn and Indigestion Heartburn and indigestion result when high progesterone levels cause relaxation of the cardiac sphincter, allowingfood and digestive juices to flow backward from the stom-ach into the esophagus. Irritation of the esophageal liningoccurs, causing the burning sensation known as heart- burn. It occurs in up to 70% of women at some point dur-ing pregnancy, with an increased frequency seen in the third trimester (Blackburn, 2007). The pain may radiateto the neck and throat. It worsens when the woman lies down, bends over after eating, or wears tight clothes. Indi-gestion (vague abdominal discomfort after meals) results from eating too much or too fast; from eating when tense,tired, or emotionally upset; from eating food that is toofatty or spicy; and from eating heavy food or food that hasbeen badly cooked or processed (Trupin, 2006). In ad-dition, the stomach is displaced upward and compressedby the large uterus in the third trimester, thus limitingthe stomach's capacity to empty quickly. Food sits, caus- ing heartburn and indigestion. Review the client's usual dietary intake and suggest that she limit or avoid gas-producing or fatty foods andlarge meals. Encourage the client to maintain proper pos-ture and remain in the sitting position for 1 to 3 hours aftereating to prevent reflux of gastric acids into the esophagusby gravity. Urge the client to eat slowly, chewing her foodthoroughly to prevent excessive swallowing of air, whichcan lead to increased gastric pressure. Instruct the clientto avoid highly spiced foods, chocolate, coffee, alcohol,sodas, and spearmint or peppermint. These items stimu-late the release of gastric digestive acids, which may causereflux into the esophagus. Avoid late-night or large meals and gum chewing. Dependent Edema Swelling is the result of increased capillary permeabil- ity caused by elevated hormone levels and increased bloodvolume. Sodium and water are retained and thirst in-creases. Edema occurs most often in dependent areassuch as the legs and feet throughout the day due to grav-ity; it improves after a night's sleep. Warm weather orprolonged standing or sitting may increase edema. Gen- eralized edema, appearing in the face, hands, and feet, can signal preeclampsia if accompanied by dizziness, blurredvision, headaches, upper quadrant pain, or nausea (Trupin,2006). This edema should be reported to the health careprovider. Appropriate suggestions to minimize dependent edema include: Elevate your feet and legs above the level of the heart. Wear support hose when standing or sitting for long periods. Change position frequently throughout the day. Walk at a sensible pace to help contract leg muscles to promote venous return. When taking a long car ride, stop to walk around every 2 hours. When standing, rock from the ball of the foot to the toes to stimulate circulation. Lie on your left side to keep the gravid uterus off the vena cava to return blood to the heart. Avoid foods high in sodium, such as lunch meats, potato chips, and bacon. Avoid wearing knee-high stockings. Drink six to eight glasses of water daily to replace fluids lost through perspiration. Avoid high intake of sugar and fats, because they cause water retention. Braxton Hicks Contractions Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular, painless contrac-tions that occur without cervical dilation. Typically they intensify in the third trimester in preparation for labor.In reality, they have been present since early in the preg-nancy but may have gone unnoticed. They are thought to increase the tone of uterine muscles for labor purposes(ACOG, 2007e). Reassure the client that these contractions are normal. Instruct the client in how to differentiate between BraxtonHicks and labor contractions. Explain that true labor con-tractions usually grow longer, stronger, and closer togetherand occur at regular intervals. Walking usually strengthenstrue labor contractions, whereas Braxton Hicks contrac-tions tend to decrease in intensity and taper off. Advise theclient to keep herself well hydrated and to rest in a side-lying position to help relieve the discomfort. Suggest thatshe use breathing techniques such as Lamaze techniquesto ease the discomfort.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 315316 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY outcome are important. Counseling should also include healthy ways to prepare food, advice to avoid medicationsunless they are prescribed for her, and advice on identify-ing teratogens within her environment or at work and how to reduce her risk from exposure. The pregnant clientcan better care for herself and the fetus if her concerns areanticipated and identied by the nurse and are incorpo-rated into teaching sessions at each prenatal visit. Personal Hygiene Hygiene is a necessity for the maintenance of good health.Cleansing the skin removes dirt, bacteria, sweat, dead skincells, and body secretions. Counsel women to wash theirhands frequently throughout the day to lower the bacterialcount on their hands and under their ngernails. Duringpregnancy a woman's sebaceous (sweat) glands becomemore active under the influence of hormones, and sweat- ing is more profuse. This increase may make it necessary touse a stronger deodorant and shower more frequently. Thecervical and vaginal glands also produce more secretionsduring pregnancy. Frequent showering helps to keepthe area dry and promotes better hygiene. Encourage theuse of cotton underwear to allow greater air circulation.Taking a tub bath in early pregnancy is permitted, butcloser to term, when the woman's center of gravity shifts,it is safer to shower to prevent the risk of slipping. Hot Tubs and Saunas Caution pregnant women to avoid using hot tubs, saunas,whirlpools, and tanning beds during pregnancy. The heatmay cause fetal tachycardia as well as raise the maternaltemperature. Exposure to bacteria in hot tubs that havenot been cleaned sufficiently is another reason to avoidthem during pregnancy. Perineal Care The glands in the cervical and vaginal areas become more active during pregnancy secondary to hormonal influences.This increase in activity will produce more vaginal secre-tions, especially in the last trimester. Advise pregnant women to shower frequently and wear all-cotton under-wear to minimize the effects of these secretions. Caution pregnant women not to douche, because douching canincrease the risk of infection, and not to wear panty liners,which block air circulation and promote moisture. Explainthat they should also avoid perfumed soaps, lotions, per-ineal sprays, and harsh laundry detergents to help preventirritation and potential infection. Dental Care Research has established that the elevated levels of es- trogen and progesterone during pregnancy cause womento be more sensitive to the effects of bacterial dental plaque,which can cause gingivitis, an oral infection character-Consider THIS! One has to wonder sometimes why women go through what they do. During my rst pregnancy I was sick forthe rst 2 months. I would experience waves of nauseafrom the moment I got out of bed until midmorning.Needless to say, I wasn't the happiest camper around.After the third month, my life seemed to settle down andI was beginning to think that being pregnant wasn'ttoo bad after all. For the moment, I was fooled. Then,during my last 2 months, another wave of discomfortstruck\u2014heartburn and constipation\u2014a doublewhammy! I now feared eating anything that mighttrigger acid indigestion and also might remain in mybody too long. I literally had to become the \"berqueen\" to combat these two challenges. Needless tosay, my \"suffering\" was well worth our bright-eyedbaby girl in the end. Thoughts: Despite the various discomforts associated with pregnancy, most women wouldn't change theirend result. Do most women experience these discomforts?What suggestions could be made to reduce them? Nursing Management to Promote Self-Care Pregnancy is considered a time of health, not illness. Health promotion and maintenance activities are key to promot-ing an optimal outcome for the woman and her fetus. Pregnant women commonly have many questions about the changes occurring during pregnancy, how thesechanges affect their usual routine, such as working, trav-eling, exercising, or engaging in sexual activity, how thechanges influence their typical self-care activities, such asbathing, perineal care, or dental care, and whether thesechanges are signs of a problem. Women may have heard stories about or been told by others what to do and what not to do during pregnancy, leading to many misconceptions and much misinformation.Take NOTE! Nurses can play a major role in providing anticipa- tory guidance and teaching to foster the woman's respon-sibility for self-care, helping to clarify misconceptions andcorrect any misinformation. Educating the client to iden-tify threats to safety posed by her lifestyle or environmentand proposing ways to modify them to avoid a negative11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 316CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 317 ized by swollen and bleeding gums (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Brushing and flossing teeth twice dailywill help reduce bacteria in the mouth. Advise the womanto visit her dentist early in the pregnancy to address anydental caries and have a thorough cleaning to prevent pos-sible infection later in the pregnancy. Advise her to avoid exposure to x-rays by informing the hygienist of the preg-nancy. If x-rays are necessary, the abdomen should beshielded with a lead apron. Researchers are exploring a link between prematurity and periodontitis, an oral infection that spreads beyondthe gum tissues to invade the supporting structures ofthe teeth. Periodontitis is characterized by bleeding gums,loss of tooth attachment, loss of supporting bone, andbad breath due to pus formation. Unfortunately, becausethis infection is chronic and often painless, women fre-quently don't realize they have it. Additional guidelinesthat the nurse should stress regarding maintaining dentalhealth include: Seek professional dental care during the rst trimester for assessment and care. Obtain treatment for dental pain and infection promptly during pregnancy. Brush twice daily for 2 minutes, especially before bed, with fluoridated toothpaste and rinse well. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and be sure to brush at the gum line to remove food debris and plaque to keep gums healthy. Eat healthy foods, especially those high in vitamins A, C, and D and calcium. Avoid sugary snacks. Chew sugar-free gum for 10 minutes after a meal if brushing isn't possible. After vomiting, rinse your mouth immediately with baking soda ( 14teaspoon) and warm water (1 cup) to neutralize the acid (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau,2007). Breast Care Since the breasts enlarge signicantly and become heavierthroughout pregnancy, stress the need to wear a rm, sup-portive bra with wide straps to balance the weight of thebreasts. Instruct the woman to anticipate buying a larger-sized bra about halfway through her pregnancy becauseof the increasing size of the breasts. Advise her to avoidusing soap on the nipple area because it can be very dry-ing.Encourage her to rinse the nipple area with plain water while bathing to keep it clean. The Montgomery glandssecrete a lubricating substance that keeps the nipples moistand discourages growth of bacteria, so there is no need touse alcohol or other antiseptics on the nipples. If the mother has chosen to breastfeed, nipple prepa- ration is unnecessary unless her nipples are inverted anddo not become erect when stimulated. Breast shells can be worn during the last 2 months to address this issue(Alexander et al., 2007). Around week 16 of pregnancy, colostrum secretion begins, which the woman may notice as moisture in herbra. Advise the woman to place breast pads or a cottoncloth in her bra and change them frequently to preventbuild-up, which may lead to excoriation. Clothing Many contemporary clothes are loose-tting and layered,so the woman may not need to buy an entirely new ward-robe to accommodate her pregnancy. Some pregnant women may continue to wear tight clothes. Point out thatloose clothing will be more comfortable for the client andher expanding waistline. Advise pregnant women to avoid wearing constricting clothes and girdles that compress the growing abdomen.Urge the woman to avoid knee-high hose, which mightimpede lower-extremity circulation and increase the riskof developing deep vein thrombosis. Low-heeled shoeswill minimize pelvic tilt and possible backache. Wearinglayered clothing may be more comfortable, especiallytoward term, when the woman may feel overheated. Exercise Exercise is well tolerated by a healthy woman during preg- nancy. It promotes a feeling of well-being, improves circu- lation, helps reduce constipation, bloating, and swelling,increases energy level, improves posture, helps sleep, pro-motes relaxation and rest, and relieves the lower back discomfort that often arises as the pregnancy progresses(ACOG, 2007h). However, the duration and difculty ofexercise should be modied throughout pregnancy becauseof a decrease in performance efficiency with gestationalage. Some women continue to push themselves to main-tain their prior level of exercise, but most nd that as theirshape changes and their abdominal area enlarges, theymust modify their exercise routines. Modification alsohelps to reduce the risk of injury caused by laxity of thejoints and connective tissue due to the hormonal effects(ACOG, 2007h). Exercise during pregnancy is contraindicated in women with preterm labor, poor weight gain, anemia,facial and hand edema, pain, hypertension, threatenedabortion, dizziness, shortness of breath, incompetentcervix, multiple gestation, decreased fetal activity, cardiacdisease, and palpitations (Trupin, 2006). ACOG has stated that healthy pregnant women can perform the same activity recommended for the generalpopulation: 30 minutes or more of moderate exerciseevery day (ACOG, 2007h; Fig. 12.11). It is believed that pregnancy is a unique time for behavior modificationand that healthy behaviors maintained or adopted during11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 317318 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY pregnancy may improve the woman's health for the rest of her life. The excess weight gained in pregnancy, whichsome women never lose, is a major public health problem(Trupin, 2006). Exercise helps the woman avoid gainingexcess weight during pregnancy. Exercise during pregnancy helps return a woman's body to good health after the baby is born. The long-termbenets of exercise that begin in early pregnancy includeimproved posture, weight control, and improved muscletone; exercise also aids in the prevention of osteoporosisafter menopause and assists in keeping the birthweight ofthe fetus within the normal range (Perkins et al., 2007).Teaching Guidelines 12.2 highlights recommendationsfor exercise during pregnancy. Sleep and Rest Getting enough sleep helps a person feel better and pro- motes optimal performance levels during the day. Thebody releases its greatest concentration of growth hor-mone during sleep, helping the body to repair damagedtissue and grow. Also, with the increased metabolic de-mands during pregnancy, fatigue is a constant challenge to many pregnant women, especially during the rst andthird trimesters. The following tips can help promote adequate sleep: Stay on a regular schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same times. Eat regular meals at regular times to keep external body cues consistent. AB FIGURE12.11 Exercising during pregnancy. TEACHING GUIDELINES 12.2 Teaching to Promote Exercise During Pregnancy Consume liquids before, during, and after exercising. Exercise three or four times each week, not sporadically. Engage in brisk walking, swimming, biking, or low-impact aerobics; these are considered ideal activities. Avoid getting overheated during exercise. Reduce the intensity of workouts in late pregnancy. Avoid jerky, bouncy, or high-impact movements. Avoid lying flat (supine) after the fourth month be-cause of hypotensive effect. Use pelvic tilt and pelvic rocking to relieve backache. Start with 5 to 10 minutes of stretching exercises. Rise slowly following an exercise session to avoiddizziness. Avoid activities such as skiing, surng, scuba diving,and ice hockey. Never exercise to the point of exhaustion. Take time to unwind and relax before bedtime. Establish a bedtime routine or pattern and follow it. Create a proper sleep environment by reducing the light and lowering the room temperature. Sources: ACOG (2007b); Page 318CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 319 Go to bed when you feel tired; if sleep doesn't occur, read a book until you are sleepy. Reduce caffeine intake later in the day. Limit fluid intake after dinner to minimize trips to the bathroom. Exercise daily to improve circulation and well-being. Use a modied Sims position to improve circulation in the lower extremities. Avoid lying on your back after the fourth month, which may compromise circulation to the uterus. Avoid sharply bending your knees, which promotes venous stasis below the knees. Keep anxieties and worries out of the bedroom. Set aside a specic area in the home or time of day for them. Sexual Activity and Sexuality Pregnancy is characterized by intense biological, psycho-logical, and social changes. These changes have direct andindirect, conscious and unconscious effects on a woman'ssexuality. The woman experiences dramatic alterationsin her physiology, her appearance, and her body, as wellas her relationships. A woman's sexual responses dur-ing pregnancy vary widely. Common symptoms such asfatigue, nausea, vomiting, breast soreness, and urinary fre-quency may reduce her desire for sexual intimacy. How-ever, many women report enhanced sexual desire due to increasing levels of estrogen.nancy on sexual desire and behavior. For example, some women experience increased sexual desire while othersexperience less. Couples may enjoy sexual activity more because there is no fear of pregnancy and no need to dis-rupt spontaneity by using birth control. An increase inpelvic congestion and lubrication secondary to estrogeninfluence may heighten orgasm for many women. Somewomen have a decrease in desire because of a negative bodyimage, fear of harming the fetus by engaging in intercourse,and fatigue, nausea, and vomiting (Trupin, 2006). A cou- ple may need assistance to adjust to the various changesbrought about by pregnancy. Reassure the women and her partner that sexual activ- ity is permissible during pregnancy unless there is a historyof any of the following: Vaginal bleeding Placenta previa Risk of preterm labor Multiple gestation Incompetent cervix Premature rupture of membranes Presence of infection (Trupin, 2006) Inform the couple that the fetus will not be injured by intercourse. Suggest that alternative positions may bemore comfortable (e.g., woman on top, side-lying), espe-cially during the later stages of pregnancy. Many women feel a particular need for closeness dur- ing pregnancy, and the woman should communicate thisneed to her partner (Thies & Travers, 2006). Emphasizeto the couple that closeness and cuddling need not culmi-nate in intercourse, and that other forms of sexual expres-sion, such as mutual masturbation, foot massage, holdinghands, kissing, and hugging can be very satisfying (Thies& Travers, 2006). Women will experience a myriad of symptoms, feel- ings, and physical sensations during their pregnancy.Having a satisfying sexual relationship during pregnancyis certainly possible, but it requires honest communicationbetween partners to determine what works best for them,and a good relationship with their health care provider toensure safety (March of Dimes, 2007a). Employment For the most part, women can continue working until delivery if they have no complications during their preg-nancy and the workplace does not present any specialhazards (ACOG, 2007a). Hazardous occupations includehealth care workers, daycare providers, laboratory techni-cians, chemists, painters, hairstylists, veterinary workers, and carpenters (ACOG, 2007a). Jobs requiring strenuouswork such as heavy lifting, climbing, carrying heavy objects,and standing for prolonged periods place a pregnantwoman at risk if modications are not instituted. Assess for environmental and occupational factors that place a pregnant women and her fetus at risk for Fluctuations in sexual desire are normal and a highly individualized response throughout pregnancy.Take NOTE! The physical and emotional adjustments of pregnancy can cause changes in body image, fatigue, mood swings,and sexual activity. The woman's changing shape, emo- tional status, fetal activity, changes in breast size, pressure on the bladder, and other common discomforts of preg- nancy result in increased physical and emotional demands. These can produce stress on the sexual relationship of thepregnant woman and her partner. However, most womenadjust well to the alterations and experience a satisfyingsexual relationship (ACOG, 2007c). Often pregnant women ask whether sexual intercourse is allowed during pregnancy or whether there are specictimes when they should refrain from having sex. This is agood opportunity to educate clients about sexual behavior during pregnancy and also to ask about their expecta-tions and individual experience related to sexuality and possible changes. It is also a good time for nurses to ad-dress the impact of the changes associated with preg-11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 319320 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY injury. Interview the woman about her employment envi- ronment. Ask about possible exposure to teratogens (sub-stances with the potential to alter the fetus permanently in form or function) and the physical demands of employ-ment: Is she exposed to temperature extremes? Does she need to stand for prolonged periods in a xed position? Adescription of the work environment is important in pro-viding anticipatory guidance to the woman. Stress theimportance of taking rest periods throughout the day,because constant physically intensive workloads increasethe likelihood of low birthweight and preterm labor andbirth (Cunningham et al., 2005). Due to the numerous physiologic and psychosocial changes that women experience during their pregnancies,the employer may need to make special accommodationsto reduce the pregnant woman's risk of hazardous expo-sures and heavy workloads. The employer may need toprovide adequate coverage so that the woman can takerest breaks; remove the woman from any areas where shemight be exposed to toxic substances; and avoid workassignments that require heavy lifting, hard physical labor,continuous standing, or constant moving. Some recom-mendations for working while pregnant are given in Teach-ing Guidelines 12.3. Travel Pregnancy does not curtail a woman's ability to travelin a car or in a plane. However, women should follow afew safety guidelines to minimize risk to themselves andtheir fetuses. According to ACOG, pregnant womencan travel safely throughout their pregnancy, although the second trimester is perhaps the best time to travelbecause there is the least chance of complications (ACOG,2007f). Pregnant women considering international travelshould evaluate the problems that could occur duringthe journey as well as the quality of medical care avail-able at the destination. Advise pregnant women to be aware of the poten- tial for injuries and trauma related to traveling, and teach women ways to prevent these from occurring. TeachingGuidelines 12.4 offers tips for safe travel on planes and toforeign areas. When traveling by car, the major risk is a car accident. The impact and momentum can lead to traumatic sepa-ration of the placenta from the wall of the uterus. Shock and massive hemorrhage might result (Trupin, 2006). Tips that nurses can offer to promote safety during groundtravel include: Always wear a three-point seat belt, no matter how short the trip, to prevent ejection or serious injuryfrom collision. Apply a nonpadded shoulder strap properly; it should cross between the breasts and over the upper abdomen,above the uterus (Fig. 12.12). If no seat belts are available (buses or vans), ride in the back seat of the vehicle. Use a lap belt that crosses over the pelvis below the uterus. Deactivate the airbag if possible. If you can't, move the seat as far back from the dashboard as possible tominimize impact on the abdomen. Avoid using a cellular phone while driving to prevent distraction. Avoid driving when very fatigued in the rst and third trimesters. Avoid late-night driving, when visibility might be compromised. Direct a tilting steering wheel away from the abdomen (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Immunizations and Medications Ideally, clients should receive all childhood immunizationsbefore conception to protect the fetus from any risk of con-genital anomalies. If the client comes for a preconceptionvisit, discuss immunizations such as and (every10 years); administer them at this time if needed.TEACHING GUIDELINES 12.3 Teaching for the Pregnant Working Woman Plan to take two 10- to 15-minute breaks within an 8-hour workday. Be sure there is a place available for you to rest,preferably in the side-lying position, with a restroomreadily available. Avoid jobs that require strenuous workloads; if this is not possible, then request a modication of work duties (lighter tasks) to reduce your workload. Change your position from standing to sitting orvice versa at least every 2 hours. Ensure that you are allowed time off withoutpenalty, if necessary, to ensure a healthy outcomefor you and your fetus. Make sure the work environment is free of toxic substances. Ensure the work environment is smoke-free so passive smoking isn't a concern. Minimize heavy lifting if associated with bending. In general, pregnant women with serious underlying illnesses should not travel to developing countries (CDC, 2007c).Take NOTE! 11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 320CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 321 TEACHING GUIDELINES 12.4 Teaching to Promote Safe Travel on Planes and in Foreign Countries Bring along a copy of the prenatal record if your travel will be prolonged in case there is a medicalemergency away from home. When traveling abroad, carry a foreign dictionarythat includes words or phrases for the most commonpregnancy emergencies. Travel with at least one companion at all times forpersonal safety. Check with your health care provider before receivingany immunizations necessary for foreign travel;some may be harmful to the fetus. When in a foreign country, avoid fresh fruit, vegetables, and local water. Avoid any milk that is not pasteurized. Eat only meat that is well cooked to avoid exposureto toxoplasmosis. Request an aisle seat and walk about the airplaneevery 2 hours. While sitting on long flights, practice calf-tensingexercises to improve circulation to the lower extremities. Be aware of typical problems encountered by pregnant travelers, such as fatigue, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, vaginal discharge, legcramps, urinary frequency, and hemorrhoids. Always wear support hose while flying to preventthe development of blood clots. Drink plenty of water to keep well hydratedthroughout the flight. FIGURE12.12 Proper application of a seat belt during pregnancy. Advise pregnant women to avoid live virus vaccines (MMR and varicella) and to avoid becoming pregnant within 1 month of havingreceived one of these vaccines because of the theoreticalrisk of transmission to the fetus (CDC, 2007a).Take NOTE! BOX 12.4 CDC Guidelines for Vaccine Administration During Pregnancy Vaccines That Should be Considered If Otherwise Indicated Hepatitis B Influenza (inactivated) Tetanus/diphtheria Meningococcal Rabies Vaccines Contraindicated vaccine) Measles Mumps Rubella VaricellaCDC guidelines for vaccine administration are high- lighted in Box 12.4. It is best for pregnant women not to take any medica- tions. At the very least, encourage them to discuss with thehealth care provider their current medications and anyherbal remedies they take so that they can learn about anypotential risks should they continue to take them duringpregnancy. Generally, if the woman is taking medicinefor seizures, high blood pressure, asthma, or depression, Sources: ACOG (2007f); APA (2008). Sources: CDC (2007a); March of Dimes (2008); Future Medicine (2007).The risk to a developing fetus from vaccination of the mother during pregnancy is primarily theoretical.Routine immunizations are not usually indicated duringpregnancy. However, no evidence exists of risk from vac-cinating pregnant women with inactivated virus or bacte-rial vaccines or toxoids. A number of other vaccines have not been adequately studied, and thus theoretical risks ofvaccination must be weighed against the risks of the diseaseto mother and fetus (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). 11223-12_CH12.qxd 2:55 PM Page 321322 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY the benets of continuing the medicine during pregnancy outweigh the risks to the fetus. The safety prole of somemedications may change according to the gestational ageof the fetus (Trupin, 2006). The Food and Drug Administration has developed a system of ranking drugs that appears on the labels andin the package inserts. These risk categories are summa-rized in Box 12.5. Always advise women to check with the health care provider for guidance. A common concern of many pregnant women in- volves the use of over-the-counter medications and herbalagents. Many women consider these products benignsimply because they are available without a prescription(Cragan et al., 2006). While herbal medications are com- monly thought of as \"natural\" alternatives to other med- icines, they can be just as potent as some prescriptionmedications. A major concern about herbal medicine isthe lack of consistent potency in the active ingredients inany given batch of product, making it difcult to knowthe exact strength by reading the label. Also, many herbscontain chemicals that cross the placenta and may causeharm to the fetus.Nurses are often asked about the safety of over-the- counter medicines and herbal agents. Unfortunately,many drugs have not been evaluated in controlled studies,and it is difcult to make general recommendations forthese products. Therefore, encourage pregnant womento check with their health care provider before taking any-thing. Questions about the use of over-the-counter andherbal products are part of the initial prenatal interview. Nursing Management to Prepare the Woman and Her Partner forLabor, Birth, and Parenthood Childbirth today is a very different experience from child- birth in previous generations. In the past, women wereliterally \"put to sleep\" with anesthetics, and they woke upwith a baby. Most women never remembered the detailsand had a passive role in childbirth as the physician deliv-ered the newborn. In the 1950s, consumers began to insiston taking a more active role in their health care, and cou-ples desired to be together during the extraordinary eventof childbirth. Beginning in the 1970s, the father or sig-nificant other support person remained with the motherthroughout labor and birth (Lleras, 2007). Childbirth education began because women de- manded to become more involved in their birthing ex-perience rather than simply turning control over to a health care provider. Nurses played a pivotal role in bringingabout this change by providing information and support- ing clients and their families, fostering a more active rolein preparing for the upcoming birth. Traditional childbirth education classes focused on developing and practicing techniques for use in managingpain and facilitating the progress of labor. Recently, thefocus of this education has broadened: it now encompassesnot only preparation for childbirth, but also preparationfor breastfeeding, infant care, transition to new parentingroles, relationship skills, family health promotion, and sex-uality (Risica & Phipps, 2007). The term used to describethis broad range of topics is perinatal education . Sub- jects commonly addressed in perinatal education include: Anatomy and physiology of reproduction Fetal growth and development Prenatal maternal exercise Physiologic and emotional changes during pregnancy Sex during pregnancy Infant growth and development Nutrition and healthy eating habits during pregnancy Teratogens and their impact on the fetus Signs and symptoms of labor Preparation for labor and birth (for parents, siblings, and other family members) Options for birth Infant nutrition, including preparation for breastfeeding Infant care, including safety, CPR, and rst aid Family planning (March of Dimes, 2007b)BOX 12.5 FDA Pregnancy Risk Classication of Drugs Category A: These drugs have been tested and found safe during pregnancy. Examples: folic acid, vitaminB6, and thyroid medicine. Category B: These drugs have been used frequently during pregnancy and do not appear to cause majorbirth defects or other fetal problems. Examples: antibiotics, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Category C: These drugs are more likely to cause problems and safety studies have not been completed.Examples: prochlorperazine (Compazine), fluconazole(Diflucan), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), and some antidepressants. Category D: These drugs have clear health risks for the fetus. Examples: alcohol, lithium (treats bipolardisorders), phenytoin (Dilantin); all chemotherapeuticagents used to treat cancer. Category X: These drugs have been shown to cause birth defects and should never be taken during pregnancy. Examples: Accutane (treats cystic (treats psoriasis), streptomycin (treats tuberculosis); thalidomide (treats insomnia), diethylstilbestrol (DES) (treats menstrual disorders),and organic contaminated food. 8/4/08 2:55 MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 323 Childbirth Education Classes Childbirth education classes teach pregnant women and their support person about pregnancy, birth, andparenting. The classes are offered in local communitiesor online and are usually taught by certified childbirtheducators. Most childbirth classes support the concept of natu- ral childbirth (a birth without pain-relieving medications) so that the woman can be in control throughout the ex-perience as much as possible. The classes differ in their approach to specic comfort techniques and breathingpatterns. The three most common childbirth methods arethe Lamaze is a psychoprophylactic (\"mind prevention\")method of preparing for labor and birth that promotesthe use of specific breathing and relaxation techniques.Dr. Fernand Lamaze, a French obstetrician, popularizedthis method of childbirth preparation in the 1960s. Lamazebelieved that conquering fear through knowledge and sup- port was important. He also believed women needed toalter the perception of suffering during childbirth. Thisperception change would come about by learning condi-tioned reflexes that, instead of signaling pain, would sig-nal the work of producing a child, and thus would carrythe woman through labor awake, aware, and in control ofher own body (Leonard, 2007). Lamaze felt strongly thatall women have the right to deliver their babies with min-imal or no medication while maintaining their dignity,minimizing their pain, maximizing their self-esteem, andenjoying the miracle of birth. Lamaze classes include information on toning exer- cises, relaxation exercises and techniques, and breath-ing methods for labor. The breathing techniques are usedin labor to enhance relaxation and to reduce the woman'sperception of pain. The goal is for women to become awareof their own comfortable rate of breathing in order tomaintain relaxation and adequate oxygenation of the fetus.Breathing techniques are an effective attention-focusingstrategy to reduce pain. Paced breathing involves breathing techniques used to decrease stress responses and therefore decrease pain.This type of breathing implies self-regulation by thewoman. The woman starts off by taking a cleansing breathat the onset and end of each contraction. This cleans-ing breath symbolizes freeing her mind from worriesand concerns. This breath enhances oxygenation andputs the woman in a relaxed state. Slow-paced breathing is associated with relaxation and should be half the normal breathing rate (six to ninebreaths per minute). This type of breathing is the mostrelaxed pattern and is recommended throughout labor.Abdominal or chest breathing may be used. It is generally best to breathe in through the nose and breathe out eitherthrough the nose or mouth, whichever is more comfort- able for the woman. Modified-paced breathing can be used for increased work or stress during labor to increase alertness or focusattention or when slow-paced breathing is no longer ef-fective in keeping the woman relaxed. The woman's res-piratory rate increases, but it does not exceed twice hernormal rate. Modified-paced breathing is a quiet upperchest breath that is increased or decreased according tothe intensity of the contraction. The inhalation and theexhalation are equal. This breathing technique shouldbe practiced during pregnancy for optimal use duringlabor. Patterned-paced breathing is similar to modified- paced breathing but with a rhythmic pattern. It uses avariety of patterns, with an emphasis on the exhalationbreath at regular intervals. Different patterns can be used,such as 4/1, 6/1, 4/1. A 4/1 rhythm is four upper chestbreaths followed by an exhalation (a sighing out of air,like blowing out a candle). Random patterns can be chosen for use as long as the basic principles of rate andrelaxation are met. Couples practice these breathing patterns typically during the last few months of the pregnancy until theyfeel comfortable using them. Focal points (visual xationon a designated object), effleurage (light abdominal mas-sage), massage, and imagery (journey of the mind to a re-laxing place) are also added to aid in relaxation. From thenurse's perspective, encourage the woman to breathe ata level of comfort that allows her to cope. Always remainquiet during the woman's periods of imagery and focalpoint visualization to avoid breaking her concentration. Bradley Method (Partner-Coached) The Bradley method uses various exercises and slow, controlled abdominal breathing to accomplish relaxation. Dr. Robert Bradley, a Denver-based obstetrician, advo-cated a completely unmedicated labor and birth experi-ence. The Bradley method emphasizes the pleasurable sensations of childbirth, teaching women to concentrate onthese sensations while \"turning on\" to their own bodies(Leonard, 2007). In 1965, he wrote Husband-Coached Childbirth, which advocated the active participation of the husband as labor coach. A woman is conditioned to work in harmony with her body using breath control and deep abdominopelvicbreathing to promote general body relaxation during labor.This method stresses that childbirth is a joyful, naturalprocess and emphasizes the partner's involvement dur-ing pregnancy, labor, birth, and the early newborn period.Thus, the training techniques are directed toward thecoach, not the mother. The coach is educated in massage/comfort techniques to use on the mother throughout thelabor and birth process.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 323324 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY Dick-Read Method In 1944 Grantly Dick-Read, a British obstetrician, wrote Childbirth Without Fear. He believed that the attitude of a woman toward her birthing process had a considerableinfluence on the ease of her labor, and he believed thatfear is the primary pain-producing agent in an otherwisenormal labor. He felt that fear builds a state of tension,creating an antagonistic effect on the laboring muscles ofthe uterus, which results in pain. Pain causes more fear,which further increases the tension, and the vicious cycleof \"fear-tension-pain\" is established (Leonard, 2007).Dick-Read sought to interrupt the circular pattern of fear,tension, and pain during the labor and birthing process.He promoted the belief that the degree of fear could bediminished with increased understanding of the normalphysiologic response to labor (Alexander et al., 2007). Dick-Read believed that prenatal instruction was essential for pain relief and that emotional factors dur-ing labor interfered with the normal labor progression.The woman achieves relaxation and reduces pain byarming herself with the knowledge of normal childbirthand using abdominal breathing during contractions. Nursing Management and Childbirth Education Childbirth education is less about methods than about mastery. The overall aim of any of the methods is to pro- mote an internal locus of control that will enable each woman to yield her body to the process of birth. As thewoman gains success and tangible benefits from the ex-ercises she is taught, she begins to reframe her beliefsand gains practical knowledge, and the impetus will bethere for her to engage in the conscious use of the tech-niques (Fig. 12.13). Nurses play a key role in supportingand encouraging each couple's use of the techniques taughtin childbirth education classes. Every woman's labor is unique, and it is important for nurses not to generalize or stereotype women. The mosteffective support a nurse can offer couples using pre- pared childbirth methods is encouragement and presence. These nursing measures must be adapted to each indi-vidual throughout the labor process. Offering encour-aging phrases such as \"great job\" or \"you can do it\" helps to reinforce their efforts and at the same time empowersthem to continue. Using eye-to-eye contact to engage thewoman's total attention is important if she appears over-whelmed or appears to lose control during the transitionphase of labor. Nurses play a signicant role in enhancing the couple's relationship by respecting the involvement of the partnerand demonstrating concern for his needs throughout labor. Offering to stay with the woman to give him a break peri-odically allows him to meet his needs while at the same time still actively participating. Offer anticipatory guid-ance to the couple and assist during critical times in labor.Demonstrate many of the coping techniques to the part-ner and praise their successful use, which increases self-esteem. Focus on their strengths and the positive elementsof the labor experience. Congratulating the couple for ajob well done is paramount. Throughout the labor experience, demonstrate per- sonal warmth and project a friendly attitude. Frequently,a nurse's touch may help to prevent a crisis by reassuringthe mother that she is doing ne. Options for Birth Settings and Care Providers From the moment a woman discovers she is pregnant, numerous decisions await her\u2014where the infant will beborn, what birth setting is best, and who will assist withthe birth. The great majority of women are well andhealthy and can consider the full range of birth settings\u2014hospital, birth center, or home setting\u2014and care providers.They should be given information about each to ensurethe most informed decision. A B FIGURE12.13 A couple practicing the techniques taught in a childbirth education class.11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 324CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 325 Birth Settings Hospitals are the most common site for birth in the United States. If the woman has a serious medical condition or isat high risk for developing one, she will probably need toplan to give birth in a hospital setting under the care of anobstetrician. Giving birth in a hospital is advantageousfor several reasons. Hospitals are best equipped to diag-nose and treat women and newborns with complications;trained personnel are available if necessary; and no trans- portation is needed if a complication should arise duringlabor or birth. Disadvantages include the high-tech atmo-sphere; strict policies and restrictions that might limit whocan be with the woman; and the medical model of care. Within the hospital setting, however, choices do exist regarding birth environments. The conventional deliveryroom resembles an operating room, where the health careprofessional delivers the newborn from the woman, whois positioned in stirrups. The woman is then transferredto the recovery area on a stretcher and then again to thepostpartum unit. The birthing suite is the other optionwithin the hospital setting. In the birthing suite, the womanand her partner remain in one place for labor, birth, andrecovery. The birthing suite is a private room decoratedto look as homelike as possible. For example, the bedconverts to allow for various birthing positions, and there may be a rocking chair or an easy chair for the woman'spartner. Despite the homey atmosphere, the room is stillequipped with emergency resuscitative obstetric equip-ment and electronic fetal monitors in case they are neededquickly (Fig. 12.14A). Such settings provide a more per-sonal childbirth experience in a less formal and intimidat-ing atmosphere compared to the traditional delivery room. A freestanding birth center (Fig. 12.14B) can be a good choice for a woman who wants more personalizedcare than in a hospital but does not feel comfortable with a home birth. In contrast to the institutional environmentin hospitals, most freestanding birth centers have a home-like atmosphere, and many are, in fact, located in con-verted homes. Some are located on hospital property andare afliated with them. Birth centers are designed to pro- vide maternity care to women judged to be at low risk forobstetric complications. Women are allowed and encour-aged to give birth in the position most comfortable forthem. Care in birth centers is often provided by midwivesand is more relaxed, with no routine intravenous lines,fetal monitoring, and restrictive protocols. A disadvantageof the birth center is the need to transport the woman toa hospital quickly if an emergency arises, because emer-gency equipment is not readily available. In a researchstudy comparing homelike to conventional institutionalsettings, the author concluded that there appeared tobe some benefits from homelike settings for childbirth,although increased support from caregivers may be moreimportant (Walsh, 2007). Most women who choose a home birth believe that birth is a natural process that requires little medical inter-vention (Mayor, 2007). Home births can be safe if thereare qualied, experienced attendants and an emergencytransfer system in place in case of serious complications.Many women choose the home setting out of a strongdesire to control their child's birth and to give birth sur- rounded by family members. Most home birth caregiversare midwives who have provided continuous care to thewoman throughout the pregnancy. Disadvantages includethe need to transport the woman to the hospital during orafter labor if a problem arises, and the limited pain man-agement available in the home setting. Care Providers While most women in the United States still receive pregnancy care from an obstetrician, an increasing num-ber are choosing a midwife for their care. The differenceis a matter of degrees. Obstetricians must nish a 4-yearresidency in obstetrics and gynecology in addition tomedical school. Certified nurse-midwives complete 1 to2 years of graduate work in midwifery following nursingschool. Obstetricians can handle high-risk pregnancies anddelivery emergencies; can administer or order pain-relief A Page 325326 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY drugs; and are assisted by a support staff in the hospital set- ting. Midwives work in hospitals, birthing centers, andhome settings to deliver care. They believe in the normalcyof birth and tolerate wide variations of what is considerednormal during labor, which leads to fewer interventionsapplied during the childbirth process (Knowlton, 2007).They are not able to handle high-risk births and some birthemergencies. In addition to the woman's primary health care pro- fessional, some women hire a doula to be with them dur-ing the childbearing process. Doula is a Greek word thatmeans \"woman's servant.\" A doula is a laywoman trainedto provide women and their families with encouragement,emotional and physical support, and information throughlate pregnancy, labor, birth, and postpartum. Doulas pro- vide the woman with continuous support throughoutlabor but do not perform any clinical procedures. Preparation for Breastfeeding or Bottle-Feeding Pregnant women are faced with a decision about which method of feeding to choose. Educate the pregnant clientabout the advantages and disadvantages of each method,allowing the woman and her partner to make an informeddecision about the best method for their situation. Provid-ing the client and her partner with this information will increase the likelihood of a successful experience regard-less of the method of feeding chosen. Breastfeeding Substantial scientific evidence exists documenting thehealth benefits of breastfeeding for newborns. Humanmilk provides an ideal balance of nutrients for newborns(ACOG, 2006). Breastfeeding is advantageous for thefollowing reasons: Human milk is digestible and economical and requires no preparation. Bonding between mother and child is promoted. Cost is less than purchasing formula. Ovulation is suppressed (however, this is not a reliable birth control method). The risk of ovarian cancer and the incidence of pre- menopausal breast cancer are reduced for the woman. Extra calories are used, which promotes weight loss gradually without dieting. Oxytocin is released to promote more rapid uterine in- volution with less bleeding. Sucking helps to develop the muscles in the infant's jaw. Absorption of lactose and minerals in the newborn is improved. The immunologic properties of breast milk help prevent infections in the baby. The composition of breast milk adapts to meet the infant's changing needs. Constipation in the baby is not a problem with ade- quate intake. Food allergies are less likely to develop in the breast- fed baby. The incidence of otitis media and upper respiratory infections in the infant is reduced. Breastfed babies are less likely to be overfed, thus reducing the risk of adult obesity. Breastfed newborns are less prone to vomiting (ACOG, 2006). One could say that lactation and breastfeeding are so natural that they should just happen on their own accord,but this is not the case. Learning to breastfeed takes prac-tice, requires support from the partner, and requires ded-ication and patience on the part of the mother; it may be necessary to work closely with a lactation consultant tobe successful and comfortable in doing it. Breastfeeding also has disadvantages. These in- clude breast discomfort, sore nipples, mastitis, engorge- ment, milk stasis, vaginal dryness, and decreased libido (Blackburn, 2007). Some mothers feel it is inconve-nient or embarrassing, limits other activities, limits part- ner involvement, increases their dependency by beingtied to the infant all the time, and restricts their use ofalcohol or drugs. Nurses can help mothers to cope withtheir fear of dependency and feelings of obligation byemphasizing the positive aspects of breastfeeding andencouraging bonding experiences. Nipple preparation is not necessary during the pre- natal period unless the nipples are inverted and do notbecome erect when stimulated. Assess for this by plac-ing the forefinger and thumb above and below the are-ola and compressing behind the nipple. If it flattens orinverts, advise the client to wear breast shields duringthe last 2 months of pregnancy. Breast shields exert a con- tinuous pressure around the areola, pushing the nipplethrough a central opening in the inner shield (ACOG,2006). The shields are worn inside the bra. Initially theshields are worn for 1 hour, and then the woman progres-sively increases the wearing time up to 8 hours daily. Theclient maintains this schedule until after delivery, and thenshe wears the shield 24 hours a day until the infant latcheson easily (ACOG, 2006). In addition, suggest that thewoman wear a supportive nursing bra 24 hours a day. Encourage the woman to attend a breastfeeding sup- port group (e.g., La Leche League), provide her withsources of information about infant feeding, and suggest that she read a good reference book about lactation. Allof these activities will help in her decision-making processand will be invaluable to her should she choose to breast-feed her newborn. Bottle Feeding Bottle-feeding an infant isn't just a matter of \"open, pour, and feed.\" Parents need information on types of11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 326CHAPTER 12 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY 327 formulas, preparation and storage of formula, equipment, and feeding positions. It is recommended that normalfull-term infants receive conventional cow's milk-basedformula; the physician should direct this choice. If theinfant has a reaction (diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain,excessive gas) to the rst formula, another formula shouldbe tried. Sometimes a soy-based formula is substituted. Interms of preparation of formula and its use, the followingguidelines should be stressed: Obtain adequate equipment (six 4-ounce bottles, eight 8-ounce bottles, and nipples). Consistency is important. Stay with a nipple that is comfortable to the infant. Frequently assess nipples for any loose pieces of rubber at the opening. Correct formula preparation is critical to the health and development of the infant. Formula is availablein three forms: ready-to-feed, concentrate, and powder. Read the formula label thoroughly before mixing. Correct formula dilution is important to avoid fluid imbalances. For ready-to-use, use as is without dilu-tion. For concentrated formulas, dilute with equalparts of water. For powdered formulas, mix one scoop of powder with 2 ounces of water. If the water supply is safe, sterilization is not necessary. Bottles and nipples should be washed in hot, sudsy water using a bottle brush. Formula should be served at room temperature. If the water supply is questionable, water should be boiled for 5 minutes before use. Formula should not be heated in a microwave oven, because it is heated unevenly. Formula can be prepared 24 hours ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator. Teach the woman and other caretakers to feed the infant in a semi-upright position using the cradle holdin the arms. This position allows for face-to-face contactbetween the infant and caretaker. Advise the caretakerto hold the bottle so that the nipple is kept full of for-mula to prevent excessive air swallowing. Instruct thecaretaker to feed the infant every 3 to 4 hours and adaptthe feeding times to the infant's needs. Frequent burp-ing of the infant (every ounce) helps prevent gas frombuilding up in the stomach. Caution the caretaker not toprop the bottle; propping the bottle can cause choking(Lawson, 2007). Bottle-feeding should mirror breastfeeding as closely as possible. While nutrition is important, so are the emo-tional and interactive components of feeding. Encouragethe caretaker to cuddle the infant closely and position theinfant so that his or her head is in a comfortable position.Also encourage communication with the infant duringfeedings.Final Preparation for Labor and Birth The nurse has played a supportive/education role for the couple throughout the pregnancy and now needs to assistin preparing them for their \"big event\" by making surethey have made informed decisions and completed thefollowing checklist: Attended childbirth preparation classes and practiced breathing techniques Selected a birth setting and made arrangements there Know what to expect during labor and birth Toured the birthing facility Packed a suitcase to take to the birthing facility when labor starts Made arrangements to have siblings and/or pets taken care of during labor Have been instructed on signs and symptoms of labor and what to do Know what to do if membranes rupture prior to going into labor Know how to reach their health care professional when labor starts Communicated their needs and desires concerning pain management Discussed the possibility of a cesarean birth if complications occur Discussed possible names for the newborn Selected a feeding method (bottle or breast) with which they feel comfortable Made a decision regarding circumcision if they have a boy Purchased an infant safety seat in which to bring their newborn home Decided on a pediatrician Have items needed to prepare for the newborn's homecoming: Infant clothes in several sizes Nursing bras Infant crib with spaces between the slats that are 2 38inches or less apart Diapers (cloth or disposable) Feeding supplies (bottles and nipples if bottle-feeding) Infant thermometer Selected a family planning method to use after the birth At each prenatal visit the nurse has had the oppor- tunity to discuss and reinforce the importance of beingprepared for the birth of the child with the parents. It is Warn the caretaker about the danger of putting the infant to bed with a bottle; this can lead to \"baby bottle tooth decay\" because sugarsin the formula stay in contact with the devel-oping teeth for prolonged periods.Take NOTE! 11223-12_CH12.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 327328 UNIT THREE PREGNANCY now up to the parents to use the nurse's guidance and put it into action to be ready for their upcoming \"big event.\" /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Preconception care is the promotion of the health and well-being of a woman and her partner before preg-nancy. The goal of preconception care is to identify anyareas such as health problems, lifestyle habits, or socialconcerns that might unfavorably affect pregnancy. /H18546A thorough history and physical examination is per- formed on the initial prenatal visit. /H18546A primary aspect of nursing management during the antepartum period is counseling and educating thepregnant women and her partner to promote healthyoutcomes for all involved. /H18546Nagele's rule can be used to establish the estimated date of birth. Using this rule, subtract 3 months, add 7 daysto the rst day of the last normal menstrual period, thencorrect the year by adding 1 to it. This date is within plusor minus 2 weeks (margin of error). /H18546Pelvic shape is typically classied as one of four types: gynecoid, android, anthropoid, and platypelloid. Thegynecoid type is the typical female pelvis and offers thebest shape for a vaginal delivery. /H18546Continuous prenatal care is important for a successful outcome. The recommended schedule is every 4 weeksup to 28 weeks (7 months); every 2 weeks from 29 to36 weeks; and every week from 37 weeks to birth. /H18546The height of the fundus is measured when the uterus arises out of the pelvis to evaluate fetal growth. /H18546The fundus reaches the level of the umbilicus at approx- imately 20 weeks and measures 20 cm. Fundal measure-ment should approximately equal the number of weeksof gestation until week 36. /H18546At each visit the woman is asked whether she is having any common signs or symptoms of preterm labor, whichmight include uterine contractions, dull backache, pres-sure in the pelvic area or thighs, increased vaginal dis- charge, menstrual-like cramps, and vaginal bleeding. /H18546Prenatal screening has become standard in prenatal care to detect neural tube defects and genetic abnormalities. /H18546The nurse should address common discomforts that occur in each trimester matter-of-factly at all prenatalvisits and should provide realistic measures to help theclient deal with them effectively. /H18546The pregnant client can better care for herself and the fetus if her concerns are anticipated by the nurseand incorporated into guidance sessions at each pre-natal visit. /H18546Iron and folic acid need to be supplemented because their increased requirements during pregnancy are usu-ally too great to be met through diet alone. /H18546The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo- gists recommends a 25- to 35-pound weight gain duringpregnancy./H18546For a pregnant woman to meet recommended dietary reference intakes (DRIs), it is important for her to eataccording to the USDA's Food Guide Pyramid. /H18546Throughout pregnancy, a well-balanced diet is critical for a healthy baby. /H18546Perinatal education has broadened its focus to in- clude preparation for pregnancy and family adapta-tion to the new parenting roles. Childbirth educationbegan because of increasing pressure from consumerswho wanted to become more involved in their birthingexperience. /H18546Three common childbirth education methods and Dick-Read (natural childbirth). /H18546The great majority of women in the United States are well and healthy and can consider the full range of birthsettings: hospital, birth center, or home setting. /H18546All pregnant women need to be able to recognize early signs of contractions to prevent preterm labor.

Numerous physiologic and psycho-logical events occur that ultimately result in the birth ofa newborn and the creation or expansion of the family. This chapter describes labor and birth as a process. It addresses initiation of labor, the premonitory signs oflabor, including true and false labor, critical factors af-fecting labor and birth, maternal and fetal response to thelaboring process, and the four stages of labor. The chap-ter also identies critical factors related to each stage oflabor: the \"10 P's\" of labor. Initiation of Labor Labor is a complex, multifaceted interaction between the mother and fetus. It is a series of processes by which thefetus is expelled from the uterus. It is difcult to deter-mine exactly why labor begins and what initiates it. Al-though several theories have been proposed to explain theonset and maintenance of labor, none of these has beenproved scientically. It is widely believed that labor is in-fluenced by a combination of factors, including uterinestretch, progesterone withdrawal, increased oxytocin sen-sitivity, and increased release of prostaglandins. One theory suggests that labor is initiated by a change in the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. During the lasttrimester of pregnancy, estrogen levels increase and pro-gesterone levels decrease. This change leads to an increasein the number of myometrium gap junctions. Gap junc-tions are proteins that connect cell membranes and facil-itate coordination of uterine contractions and myometrialstretching (Gilbert, 2007). Although physiologic evidence for the role of oxytocin in the initiation of labor is inconclusive, the number of oxy-tocin receptors in the uterus increases at the end of preg-nancy. This creates an increased sensitivity to oxytocin. Estrogen, the levels of which are also rising, increases myo-metrial sensitivity to oxytocin. With the increasing levels ofoxytocin in the maternal blood in conjunction with fetalproduction, initiation of uterine contractions can occur.Oxytocin also aids in stimulating prostaglandin synthesisthrough receptors in the decidua. Prostaglandins lead toadditional contractions, cervical softening, gap junction in-duction, and myometrial sensitization, thereby leading toa progressive cervical dilation (the opening or enlarge- ment of the external cervical os) (Blackburn, 2007). Prostaglandins are produced in the decidua and fetal membranes and have a central role in the initiation oflabor. Prostaglandin levels increase late during pregnancysecondary to elevated estrogen levels. Prostaglandins stim-ulate smooth muscle contraction of the uterus. An increasein prostaglandins leads to myometrial contractions and areduction in cervical resistance. Subsequently, the cervixsoftens, thins out, and dilates during labor.336 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Premonitory Signs of Labor Before the onset of labor, a pregnant woman's body under- goes several changes in preparation for the birth of thenewborn. The changes that occur often lead to character-istic signs and symptoms that suggest that labor is near.These premonitory signs and symptoms can vary, and notevery woman experiences every one of them. Cervical Changes Before labor begins, cervical softening and possible cervi-cal dilation with descent of the presenting part into thepelvis occurs. These changes can occur 1 month to 1 hourbefore actual labor begins. As labor approaches, the cervix changes from an elon- gated structure to a shortened, thinned segment. Cervicalcollagen bers undergo enzymatic rearrangement intosmaller, more flexible bers that facilitate water absorp-tion, leading to a softer, more stretchable cervix. Thesechanges occur secondary to the effects of prostaglandinsand pressure from Braxton Hicks contractions (Black-burn, 2007). Lightening Lightening occurs when the fetal presenting part begins to descend into the maternal pelvis. The uterus lowersand moves into a more anterior position. The shape of theabdomen changes as a result of the change in the uterus.With this descent, the woman usually notes that herbreathing is much easier. However, she may complain ofincreased pelvic pressure, cramping, and low back pain.She may notice an increase in vaginal discharge and morefrequent urination. Also, edema of the lower extremitiesmay occur as a result of the increased stasis of poolingblood. In primiparas, lightening can occur 2 weeks ormore before labor begins; among multiparas it may notoccur until labor (Walsh, 2007). Increased Energy Level Some women report a sudden increase in energy beforelabor. This is sometimes referred to as nesting, becausemany women will focus this energy toward childbirthpreparation by cleaning, cooking, preparing the nursery,and spending extra time with other children in the house-hold. The increased energy level usually occurs 24 to 48 hours before the onset of labor. It is thought to be theresult of an increase in epinephrine release caused by adecrease in progesterone (Cheng & Caughey, 2007). Bloody Show At the onset of labor, the mucous plug that lls the cer- vical canal during pregnancy is expelled as a result of cer-vical softening and increased pressure of the presentingpart. These ruptured cervical capillaries release a smallT11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 336amount of blood that mixes with mucus, resulting in the pink-tinged secretions known as bloody show. Braxton Hicks Contractions Braxton Hicks contractions, which the woman may have been experiencing throughout the pregnancy, may becomestronger and more frequent. Braxton Hicks contractionsare typically felt as a tightening or pulling sensation of thetop of the uterus. They occur primarily in the abdomenand groin and gradually spread downward before relaxing.In contrast, true labor contractions are more commonlyfelt in the lower back. These contractions aid in movingthe cervix from a posterior position to an anterior position.They also help in ripening and softening the cervix. How-ever, the contractions are irregular and can be decreasedby walking, voiding, eating, increasing fluid intake, orchanging position. Braxton Hicks contractions usually last about 30 sec- onds but can persist for as long as 2 minutes. As birthdraws near and the uterus becomes more sensitive tooxytocin, the frequency and intensity of these contractionsincrease. However, if the contractions last longer than30 seconds and occur more often than four to six times anhour, advise the woman to contact her health care providerso that she can be evaluated for possible preterm labor,especially if she is less than 38 weeks pregnant.CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 337 True Versus False Labor False labor is a condition occurring during the latter weeks of some pregnancies in which irregular uterine contrac-tions are felt, but the cervix is not affected. In contrast, truelabor is characterized by contractions occurring at regularintervals that increase in frequency, duration, and inten-sity. True labor contractions bring about progressive cervical dilation and effacement. Table 13.1 summarizes the differences between true and false labor. False labor,prodromal labor, and Braxton Hicks contractions are allnames for contractions that do not contribute in a mea-surable way toward the goal of birth. Many women fear being sent home from the hospi- tal with \"false labor.\" All women feel anxious when theyfeel contractions, but they should be informed that laborcould be a long process, especially if it is their rst preg-nancy. Encourage the woman to think of false labor or\"pre-labor signs\" as positive, as they are part of the entirelabor continuum. With rst pregnancies, the cervix cantake up to 20 hours to dilate completely (Cunninghamet al., 2005). An infant born between 34 and 36 com- pleted weeks of gestation is identied as \"late preterm\" and experiences many of the samehealth issues as other preterm birth infants(AWHONN, 2007).Take NOTE! Spontaneous Rupture of Membranes One in four women will experience spontaneous rupture of the membranes before the onset of labor (Institute ofMedicine, 2007). The rupture of membranes can resultin either a sudden gush or a steady leakage of amnioticfluid. Although much of the amniotic fluid is lost whenthe rupture occurs, a continuous supply is produced toensure protection of the fetus until birth. After the amniotic sac has ruptured, the barrier to in- fection is gone and an ascending infection is possible. Inaddition, there is a danger of cord prolapse if engagementhas not occurred with the sudden release of fluid and pres-sure with rupture. Due to the possibility of these compli-cations, advise women to notify their health care providerand go in for an evaluation.Consider THIS! I always pictured myself a dignied woman and behaved in ways to demonstrate that, for that was the way I was raised. My mother and grandmotheralways stressed that you should look good, dress well,and do nothing to embarrass yourself in public. I dida fairly good job of living up to their expectations untilI become pregnant. I recall I was overdue according to my dates and was miserable in the summer heat. I decided to go to the store for some ice cream. As Iwaddled down the grocery aisles, all of a sudden mywater broke and came pouring down my legs all overthe floor.

Factors Affecting the Labor Process In many references, the critical factors that affect the process of labor and birth are outlined as the \"ve P's\": 1. Passageway (birth canal) 2. Passenger (fetus and placenta)3. Powers (contractions)4. Position (maternal)5. Psychological response These critical factors are commonly accepted and discussed by health care professionals. However, ve ad-ditional \"P's\" can also affect the labor process: 1. Philosophy (low-tech, high-touch) 2. Partners (support caregivers)3. Patience (natural timing)4. Patient preparation (childbirth knowledge base)5. Pain control (comfort measures) These ve additional \"P's\" are helpful in planning care for the laboring family. These patient-focused fac-tors are an attempt to foster labor that can be managedthrough the use of high touch, patience, support, knowl-edge, and pain management.Passageway The birth passageway is the route through which the fetus must travel to be born vaginally. The passageway consistsof the maternal pelvis and soft tissues. Of the two, however,the maternal bony pelvis is more important because it isrelatively unyielding (except for the coccyx). Typically thepelvis is assessed and measured during the rst trimester,often at the rst visit to the health care provider, to identifyany abnormalities that might hinder a successful vaginalbirth. As the pregnancy progresses, the hormones relaxinand estrogen cause the connective tissues to become morerelaxed and elastic and cause the joints to become moreflexible to prepare the mother's pelvis for birth. Addition-ally, the soft tissues usually yield to the forces of labor. Bony Pelvis The maternal bony pelvis can be divided into the true andfalse portions. The false (or greater) pelvis is composed ofthe upper flared parts of the two iliac bones with their con-cavities and the wings of the base of the sacrum. The falsepelvis is divided from the true pelvis by an imaginary linedrawn from the sacral prominence at the back to the supe-rior aspect of the symphysis pubis at the front of the pelvis.This imaginary line is called the linea terminalis. The falsepelvis lies above this imaginary line; the true pelvis liesbelow it (Fig. 13.1). The true pelvis is the bony passagewaythrough which the fetus must travel. It is made up of threeplanes: the inlet, the mid-pelvis (cavity), and the outlet. Pelvic Inlet The pelvic inlet allows entrance to the true pelvis. It isbounded by the sacral prominence in the back, the ilium onthe sides, and the superior aspect of the in11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 338the front (Edmonds, 2007). The pelvic inlet is wider in the transverse aspect (sideways) than it is from front to back. Mid-Pelvis The mid-pelvis (cavity) occupies the space between theinlet and outlet. It is through this snug, curved space thatthe fetus must travel to reach the outside. As the fetuspasses through this small area, its chest is compressed,causing lung fluid and mucus to be expelled. This expul-sion removes the space-occupying fluid so that air canenter the lungs with the newborn's rst breath. Pelvic Outlet The pelvic outlet is bound by the ischial tuberosities, thelower rim of the symphysis pubis, and the tip of the coc-cyx. In comparison with the pelvic inlet, the outlet is widerfrom front to back. For the fetus to pass through the pelvis,the outlet must be large enough. To ensure the adequacy of the pelvic outlet for vagi- nal birth, the following pelvic measurements are assessed: Diagonal conjugate of the inlet (distance between the anterior surface of the sacral prominence and the ante-rior surface of the inferior margin of the symphysispubis) Transverse or ischial tuberosity diameter of the outlet (distance at the medial and lowest aspect of the ischialtuberosities, at the level of the anus; a known handspan or clenched-st measurement is generally used toobtain this measurement) True or obstetric conjugate (distance estimated from the measurement of the diagonal conjugate; 1.5 cm issubtracted from the diagonal conjugate measurement) For more information about pelvic measurements, see Chapter 12. If the diagonal conjugate measures at least 11.5 cm and the true or obstetric conjugate measures 10 cm orCHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 339 more (1.5 cm less than the diagonal conjugate, or about 10 cm), then the pelvis is large enough for a vaginal birthof what would be considered a normal-size newborn. Pelvic Shape In addition to size, the shape of a woman's pelvis is a de-termining factor for a vaginal birth. is dividedinto four main gynecoid pelvis is considered the true female pelvis, occurring in about 50% of all women; it is lesscommon in men (Leonard, 2007). Vaginal birth is mostfavorable with this type of pelvis because the inlet isround and the outlet is roomy. This shape offers the op- timal diameters in all three planes of the pelvis. This typeof pelvis allows early and complete fetal internal rotationduring labor. The anthropoid pelvis is common in men and occurs in 20% to 30% of women (Billington & Stevenson, 2007). The pelvic inlet is oval and the sacrum is long, producinga deep pelvis (wider front to back [anterior to posterior]than side to side [transverse]). Vaginal birth is more fa-vorable with this pelvic shape compared to the android orplatypelloid shape (Frieden & Chan, 2007). The android pelvis is considered the male-shaped pelvis and is characterized by a funnel shape. It occurs inapproximately 20% of women (Cunningham et al., 2005).The pelvic inlet is heart-shaped and the posterior segmentsare reduced in all pelvic planes. Descent of the fetal headinto the pelvis is slow, and failure of the fetus to rotate iscommon. The prognosis for labor is poor, subsequentlyleading to cesarean birth. The platypelloid or flat pelvis is the least common type of pelvic structure among men and women, withan approximate incidence of 5% (Billington & Stevenson,2007). The pelvic cavity is shallow but widens at the pelvicoutlet, making it difcult for the fetus to descend through False pelvis True pelvis Linea terminalis Anterior view D Platypelloid the mid-pelvis. It is not favorable for a vaginal birth unless the fetal head can pass through the inlet. Women with thistype of pelvis usually require cesarean birth. An important principle is that most pelves are not purely dened but occur in nature as mixed types. Manywomen have a combination of these four basic pelvistypes, with no two pelves being exactly the same. Regard-less of the shape, the newborn will be born if size and positioning remain compatible. The narrowest part of the fetus attempts to align itself with the narrowest pelvicdimension (e.g., biparietal to interspinous diameters, whichmeans the fetus generally tends to rotate to the most ampleportion of the pelvis). Soft Tissues The soft tissues of the passageway consist of the cervix,the pelvic floor muscles, and the vagina. Through efface- ment , the cervix effaces (thins) and dilates (opens) to allow the presenting fetal part to descend into the vagina.340 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH The pelvic floor muscles help the fetus to rotate ante- riorly as it passes through the birth canal. The soft tissuesof the vagina expand to accommodate the fetus duringbirth. Passenger The fetus (with placenta) is the passenger. The fetal head (size and presence of molding), fetal attitude (degree ofbody flexion), fetal lie (relationship of body parts), fetalpresentation (rst body part), fetal position (relationshipto maternal pelvis), fetal station, and fetal engagementare all important factors that have an impact on the ulti-mate outcome in the birthing process. Fetal Head The fetal head is the largest and least compressible fetalstructure, making it an important factor in relation tolabor and birth. Considerable variation in the size and dia-meter of the fetal skull is often seen. Compared with an adult, the fetal head is large in proportion to the rest of the body, usually about one quar- ter of the body surface area (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Thebones that make up the face and cranial base are fused andessentially fixed. However, the bones that make up therest of the cranium (two frontal bones, two parietal bones,FIGURE13.2 shapes. D) Platypelloid. Cervical effacement and dilation is similar to pulling a turtleneck sweater over your head.Take NOTE! 11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 340and the occipital are not fused; rather, they are soft and pliable, with gaps between the plates of bone. Thesegaps, which are membranous spaces between the cranialbones, are called sutures, and the intersections of these su-tures are called fontanelles. Sutures are important becausethey allow the cranial bones to overlap in order for thehead to adjust in shape (elongate) when pressure is ex-erted on it by uterine contractions or the maternal bonypelvis. Some diameters shorten whereas others lengthen asthe head is molded during the labor and birthing process.This malleability of the fetal skull may decrease fetal skulldimensions by 0.5 to 1 cm (Blackburn, 2007). After birth,the sutures close as the bones grow and the brain reachesits full growth. The changed (elongated) shape of the fetal skull at birth as a result of overlapping of the cranial bones isknown as molding . Along with molding, fluid can also collect in the scalp (caput succedaneum) or blood can col-lect beneath the scalp (cephalohematoma), further dis-torting the shape and appearance of the fetal head. Caputsuccedaneum can be described as edema of the scalp atthe presenting part. This swelling crosses suture lines anddisappears within 3 to 4 days. Cephalhematoma is a col-lection of blood between the periosteum and the bone. Itdoes not cross suture lines and is generally reabsorbedover the next 4 to 6 weeks (Arenson & Drake, 2007).CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 341 Parents may become concerned about the distortion of their newborn's head. However, reassurance that the oblong shape is onlytemporary is usually all that is needed to reduce theiranxiety.Take NOTE! Sutures also play a role in helping to identify the position of the fetal head during a vaginal examination.Figure 13.3 shows a fetal skull. The coronal sutures arelocated between the frontal and parietal bones and ex-tend transversely on both sides of the anterior fontanelles.The frontal suture is located between the two frontalbones. The lambdoidal sutures are located between theoccipital bone and the two parietals, extending trans-versely on either side of the posterior fontanelles. Thesagittal suture is located between the parietal bones anddivides the skull into the right and left halves. During apelvic examination, palpation of these sutures by the ex-aminer reveals the position of the fetal head and the de-gree of rotation that has occurred. The anterior and posterior fontanelles are also useful in helping to identify the position of the fetal head, andthey allow for molding. In addition, the fontanelles areimportant when evaluating the newborn. spot\" of the newborn's head. It is diamond-shaped and measures about 2 to 3 cm. Itremains open for 12 to 18 months after birth to allowfor growth of the brain (Edmonds, 2007). The posteriorfontanelle corresponds to the anterior one but is located at the back of the fetal head; it is triangular. This one closeswithin 8 to 12 weeks after birth and measures, on average,0.5 to 1 cm at its widest diameter (Kenner & Lott, 2007). The diameter of the fetal skull is an important con- sideration during the labor and birth process. Fetal skulldiameters are measured between the various landmarksof the skull. Diameters include occipitofrontal, occipito-mental, suboccipitobregmatic, and biparietal (Fig. 13.4).The two most important diameters that can affect the birthprocess are the suboccipitobregmatic (approximately9.5 cm at term) and the biparietal (approximately 9.25 cmat term) diameters. The suboccipitobregmatic diameter,measured from the base of the occiput to the center of theanterior fontanelle, identies the smallest anteroposteriordiameter of the fetal skull. The biparietal diameter mea-sures the largest transverse diameter of the fetal skull: thedistance between the two parietal bones. In a cephalic(headrst) presentation, which occurs in 95% of all term11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 341births, if the fetus presents in a flexed position in which the chin is resting on the chest, the optimal or smallest fetalskull dimensions for a vaginal birth are demonstrated.If the fetal head is not fully flexed at birth, the anteroposte-riordiameter increases. This increase in dimension might prevent the fetal skull from entering the maternal pelvis. Fetal Attitude Fetal attitude is another important consideration related to the passenger. Fetal attitude refers to the posturing (flex- ion or extension) of the joints and the relationship of fetalparts to one another. The most common fetal attitudewhen labor begins is with all joints flexed\u2014the fetal backis rounded, the chin is on the chest, the thighs are flexedon the abdomen, and the legs are flexed at the knees (Fig.13.5). This normal fetal position is most favorable for vagi-nal birth, presenting the smallest fetal skull diameters tothe pelvis. When the fetus presents to the pelvis with abnormal attitudes (no flexion or extension), the diameter can in-crease the diameter of the presenting part as it passesthrough the pelvis, increasing the difficulty of birth. Anattitude of extension tends to present larger fetal skulldiameters, which may make birth difficult. Fetal Lie Fetal lierefers to the relationship of the long axis (spine) of the fetus to the long axis (spine) of the mother. Thereare two primary lies: longitudinal (which is the most com-mon) and transverse (Fig. 13.6). A longitudinal lie occurs when the long axis of the fetus is parallel to that of the mother (fetal spine to ma-ternal spine side-by-side). A transverse lie occurs whenthe long axis of the fetus is perpendicular to the longaxis of the mother (fetus spine lies across the maternalabdomen and crosses her spine). A fetus in a transverse lie position cannot be delivered vaginally (Billington &Stevenson, 2007).342 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Fetal Presentation Fetal presentation refers to the body part of the fetus that enters the pelvic inlet rst (the \"presenting part\").This is the fetal part that lies over the inlet of the pelvis orthe cervical os. Knowing which fetal part is coming rstat birth is critical for planning and initiating appropriateinterventions. The three main fetal presentations are cephalic (head rst), breech (pelvis rst), and shoulder (scapula rst).The majority of term newborns (95%) enter this world ina cephalic presentation; breech presentation accounts for3% of term births, shoulder presentations for approxi-mately 2% (Edmonds, 2007). In a cephalic presentation, the presenting part is usu- ally the occiput portion of the fetal head (Fig. 13.7). Thispresentation is also referred to as a vertex presentation.Variations in a vertex presentation include the military,brow, and face presentations. Breech presentation occurs when the fetal buttocks or feet enter the maternal pelvis rst and the fetal skull enterslast. This abnormal presentation poses several challenges atbirth. Primarily, the largest part of the fetus (skull) is bornlast and may become \"hung up\" or stuck in the pelvis.In addition, the umbilical cord can become compressedbetween the fetal skull and the maternal pelvis after thefetal chest is born because the head is the last to exit.Moreover, unlike the hard fetal skull, the buttocks are softand are not as effective as a cervical dilator during laborcompared with a cephalic presentation. Finally, there is thepossibility of trauma to the head as a result of the lack ofopportunity for molding. FIGURE13.5 Fetal attitude: Full flexion.

( A) Frank breech. ( B) Complete breech. ( C) Single footling breech. ( D) Double footling breech.The types of breech presentations are determined by the positioning of the fetal legs (Fig. 13.8). In a frankbreech (50% to 70%), the buttocks present first withboth legs extended up toward the face. In a full or com-plete breech (5% to 10%), the fetus sits crossed-leggedabove the cervix. In a footling or incomplete breech (10%to 30%), one or both legs are presenting. Breech presen-tations are associated with prematurity, placenta previa,multiparity, uterine abnormalities (fibroids), and somecongenital anomalies such as hydrocephaly (Fischer,2007). A frank breech can result in a vaginal birth, butcomplete, footling, and incomplete breech presentationsgenerally necessitate a cesarean birth. A shoulder presentation occurs when the fetal shoul- ders present rst, with the head tucked inside. Odds of ashoulder presentation are one in 1,000 (Cunningham et al., 2005). The fetus is in a transverse lie with the shoul- der as the presenting part. Conditions associated withshoulder presentation include placenta previa, multiplegestation, or fetal anomalies. A cesarean birth is typicallynecessary (Edmonds, 2007).Fetal Position Fetal position describes the relationship of a given point on the presenting part of the fetus to a designated pointof the maternal pelvis (Walsh, 2007). The landmark fetalpresenting parts include the occipital bone (O), whichdesignates a (acromion process [A]), which designates a shoul- der presentation. In addition, the maternal pelvis is divided into four quadrants: right anterior, left anterior, right posterior,and left posterior. These quadrants designate whether thepresenting part is directed toward the front, back, left, orright side of the pelvis. Fetal position is determined rstby identifying the presenting part and then the maternalquadrant the presenting part is facing (Fig. 13.9). Posi-tion is indicated by a three-letter abbreviation as follows: The rst letter denes whether the presenting part is tilted toward the left (L) or the right (R) side of thematernal pelvis.11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 343 The second letter represents the particular presenting part of the fetus: O for occiput, S for sacrum (buttocks),M for mentum (chin), A for acromion process, and Dfor dorsal (refers to the fetal back) when denoting thefetal position in shoulder presentations (Cheng &Caughey, 2007). The third letter denes the location of the presenting part in relation to the anterior (A) portion of the mater-nal pelvis or the posterior (P) portion of the maternalpelvis. If the presenting part is directed to the side ofthe maternal pelvis, the fetal presentation is designatedas transverse (T). For example, if the occiput is facing the left anterior quadrant of the pelvis, then the position is termed left oc-cipitoanterior and is recorded as LOA. LOA is the mostcommon (and most favorable) fetal position for birthingtoday, followed by right occipitoanterior (ROA). The positioning of the fetus allows the fetal head to contour to the diameters of the maternal pelvis. LOA andROA are optimal positions for vaginal birth. An occiputposterior position may lead to a long and difcult birth,and other positions may or may not be compatible withvaginal birth.344 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Fetal Station Station refers to the relationship of the presenting part to the level of the maternal pelvic ischial spines. Fetal sta-tion is measured in centimeters and is referred to as aminus or plus, depending on its location above or belowthe ischial spines. Typically, the ischial spines are the nar-rowest part of the pelvis and are the natural measuringpoint for the birth progress. Zero (0) station is designated when the presenting part is at the level of the maternal ischial spines. When thepresenting part is above the ischial spines, the distance isrecorded as minus stations. When the presenting part isbelow the ischial spines, the distance is recorded as plusstations. For instance, if the presenting part is above theischial spines by 1 cm, it is documented as being a 1 sta- tion; if the presenting part is below the ischial spines by 1 cm, it is documented as being a +1 station. An easy way to understand this concept is to think in terms of meet-ing the goal, which is the birth. If the fetus is descending downward (past the ischial spines) and moving towardmeeting the goal of birth, then the station is positive andthe centimeter numbers grow bigger from +1 to +4. If the fetus is not descending past the ischial spines, then the sta-tion is negative and the centimeter numbers grow bigger Left Examples of fetal positions in a vertex presentation.

The bottom viewis that seen with the woman in a dorsalrecumbent position.11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 344from 1 to 4. The farther away the presenting part from the outside, the larger the negative number (-4 cm). Thecloser the presenting part of the fetus is to the outside, thelarger the positive number ( +4 cm). Figure 13.10 shows stations of presenting part. Fetal Engagement Engagement signies the entrance of the largest diame- ter of the fetal presenting part (usually the fetal head) intothe smallest diameter of the maternal pelvis (Blackburn,2007). The fetus is said to be \"engaged\" in the pelviswhen the presenting part reaches 0 station. Engagementis determined by pelvic examination. The largest diameter of the fetal head is the biparietal diameter. It extends from one parietal prominence to theother. It is an important factor in the navigation throughthe maternal pelvis. Engagement typically occurs in primi-gravidas 2 weeks before term, whereas multiparas may ex-perience engagement several weeks before the onset oflabor or not until labor begins.CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 345 known as the cardinal movements of labor. They are de- liberate, specic, and very precise movements that allowthe smallest diameter of the fetal head to pass through acorresponding diameter of the mother's pelvic structure.Although cardinal movements are conceptualized as sep-arate and sequential, the movements are typically concur-rent (Fig. 13.11). Engagement Engagement occurs when the greatest transverse diameterof the head in vertex (biparietal diameter) passes throughthe pelvic inlet (usually 0 station). The head usually entersthe pelvis with the sagittal suture aligned in the transversediameter. Descent Descent is the downward movement of the fetal headuntil it is within the pelvic inlet. Descent occurs intermit-tently with contractions and is brought about by one ormore of the following forces: Pressure of the amniotic fluid Direct pressure of the fundus on the fetus' buttocks or head (depending on which part is located in the top ofthe uterus) Contractions of the abdominal muscles (second stage) Extension and straightening of the fetal body Descent occurs throughout labor, ending with birth. During this time, the mother experiences discomfort, butshe is unable to isolate this particular fetal movementfrom her overall discomfort. Flexion Flexion occurs as the vertex meets resistance from thecervix, the walls of the pelvis, or the pelvic floor. As a re-sult, the chin is brought into contact with the fetal thoraxand the presenting diameter is changed from occipito-frontal to suboccipitobregmatic (9.5 cm), which achievesthe smallest fetal skull diameter presenting to the maternalpelvic dimensions. Internal Rotation After engagement, as the head descends, the lower portionof the head (usually the occiput) meets resistance from oneside of the pelvic floor. As a result, the head rotates about45 degrees anteriorly to the midline under the symphysis.This movement is known as internal rotation. Internal ro-tation brings the anteroposterior diameter of the head inline with the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet.It aligns the long axis of the fetal head with the long axis ofthe maternal pelvis. The widest portion of the maternalpelvis is the anteroposterior diameter, and thus the fetusmust rotate to accommodate the pelvis. Extension With further descent and full flexion of the head, thenucha (the base of the occiput) becomes impinged under -4 -3-2-1 0 +1+2+3+4 FIGURE13.10 Fetal stations. The term floating is used when engagement has not occurred, because the presenting part is freely movable above the pelvic inlet.Take NOTE! Cardinal Movements of Labor The fetus goes through many positional changes as it trav-els through the passageway. These positional changes are11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 345the symphysis. Resistance from the pelvic floor causes the fetal head to extend so that it can pass under thepubic arch. Extension occurs after internal rotation iscomplete. The head emerges through extension underthe symphysis pubis along with the shoulders. The an-terior fontanel, brow, nose, mouth, and chin are bornsuccessively. External Rotation (Restitution) After the head is born and is free of resistance, it untwists,causing the occiput to move about 45 degrees back to itsoriginal left or right position (restitution). The sagittal su-ture has now resumed its normal right-angle relationshipto the transverse (bisacromial) diameter of the shoulders346 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH (i.e., the head realigns with the position of the back in the birth canal). External rotation of the fetal head allows theshoulders to rotate internally to t the maternal pelvis. Expulsion Expulsion of the rest of the body occurs more smoothlyafter the birth of the head and the anterior and posteriorshoulders (Cheng & Caughey, 2007). Powers The primary stimulus powering labor is uterine contrac-tions. Contractions cause complete dilation and effacementof the cervix during the rst stage of labor. The secondary Engagement, Descent, Flexion Internal Rotation Extension Beginning (rotation complete) Extension CompleteExternal Rotation restitution) External Rotation (shoulder rotation) ExpulsionFIGURE13.11 Cardinal movements of labor.11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 346powers in labor involve the use of intra-abdominal pressure (voluntary muscle contractions) exerted by the womanas she pushes and bears down during the second stage oflabor. Uterine Contractions Uterine contractions are involuntary and therefore cannotbe controlled by the woman experiencing them, regard-less of whether they are spontaneous or induced. Uter- ine contractions are rhythmic and intermittent, with aperiod of relaxation between contractions. This pauseallows the woman and the uterine muscles to rest. In ad-dition, this pause restores blood flow to the uterus andplacenta, which is temporarily reduced during each uter-ine contraction. Uterine contractions are responsible for thinning and dilating the cervix, and they thrust the presenting part to-ward the lower uterine segment. With each uterine con-traction, the upper segment of the uterus becomes shorterand thicker, whereas the lower passive segment and thecervix become longer, thinner, and more distended. Thedivision between the contractile upper portion (fundus) ofthe uterus and the lower portion is described as the phys-iologic retraction ring. Longitudinal traction on the cervixby the fundus as it contracts and retracts leads to cervicaleffacement and dilation. Uterine contractions cause theupper uterine segment to shorten, making the cervix paper-thin when it becomes fully effaced. The cervical canal reduces in length from 2 cm to a paper-thin entity and is described in terms of percentagesfrom 0 to 100%. In primigravidas, effacement typicallystarts before the onset of labor and usually begins beforedilation; in multiparas, however, neither effacement nordilation may start until labor ensues. On clinical exami-nation the following may be assessed: Cervical canal 2 cm in length would be described as 0% effaced. Cervical canal 1 cm in length would be described as 50% effaced.CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 347 Cervical canal 0 cm in length would be described as 100% effaced. Dilation is dependent on the pressure of the present- ing part and the contraction and retraction of the uterus.The diameter of the cervical os increases from less than 1 cm to approximately 10 cm to allow for birth. When thecervix is fully dilated, it is no longer palpable on vaginalexamination. Descriptions may include the following: External cervical os closed: 0 cm dilated External cervical os half open: 5 cm dilated External cervical os fully open: 10 cm dilated During early labor, uterine contractions are described as mild, they last about 30 seconds, and they occur aboutevery 5 to 7 minutes. As labor progresses, contractions lastlonger (60 seconds), occur more frequently (2 to 3 min-utes apart), and are described as being moderate to highin intensity. Each contraction has three phases: increment (build- up of the contraction), acme (peak or highest intensity),and decrement (descent or relaxation of the uterine mus-cle bers; Fig. 13.12). Uterine contractions are monitored and assessed according to three parameters: frequency, duration, andintensity. 1.Frequency refers to how often the contractions occur and is measured from the increment of onecontraction to the increment of the next contraction. 2.Duration refers to how long a contraction lasts and is measured from the beginning of the increment tothe end of the decrement for the same contraction. 3.Intensity refers to the strength of the contraction determined by manual palpation or measured by aninternal intrauterine catheter (IUPC). The catheter is positioned in the uterine cavity through the cervixafter the membranes have ruptured. It reports inten-sity by measuring the pressure of the amniotic fluidinside the uterus in millimeters of mercury (Edmonds, 2007). Contraction Period of relaxation Duration FrequencyAcme Beginning End Beginning Increment Decrement FIGURE13.12 The three phases of a uterine contraction.11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 347Intra-Abdominal Pressure Increased intra-abdominal pressure (voluntary muscle con- tractions) compresses the uterus and adds to the power ofthe expulsion forces of the uterine contractions (Blackburn,2007). Coordination of these forces in unison promotesbirth of the fetus and expulsion of the fetal membranes andplacenta from the uterus. Interference with these forces(such as when a woman is highly sedated or extremely anx-ious) can compromise the effectiveness of these powers. Psychological Response Childbearing can be one of the most life-altering expe-riences for a woman. The experience of childbirth goesbeyond the physiologic aspects: it influences her self-confidence, self-esteem, and view of life, relationships,and children. Her state of mind (psyche) throughout theentire process is critical to bring about a positive out-come for her and her family. Factors promoting a posi-tive birth experience include: Clear information about procedures Support; not being alone Sense of mastery, self-condence Trust in staff caring for her Positive reaction to the pregnancy Personal control over breathing Preparation for the childbirth experience Having a strong sense of self and meaningful support from others can often help women manage labor well.Feeling safe and secure typically promotes a sense of con-trol and ability to withstand the challenges of the child-bearing experience. Anxiety and fear, however, decreasea woman's ability to cope with the discomfort of labor.Maternal catecholamines secreted in response to anxietyand fear can inhibit uterine blood flow and placental per-fusion. In contrast, relaxation can augment the naturalprocess of labor (Leonard, 2007). Preparing mentally forchildbirth is important so that the woman can work with,rather than against, the natural forces of labor. Position (Maternal) Maternal positioning during labor has only recently beenthe subject of well-controlled research. Scientic evidencehas shown that nonmoving, back-lying positions duringlabor are not healthy (Hanson 2006). However, despitethis evidence to the contrary, most women continue to lieflat on their backs during labor. Some of the reasons whythis practice continues include the following: Belief that laboring women need to conserve their energy and not tire themselves Belief that nurses cannot keep track of the where- abouts of ambulating women Belief that the supine position facilitates vaginal exam- inations and external belt adjustment348 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Belief that a bed is \"where one is supposed to be\" in a hospital setting Belief that the position is more convenient for the delivering health professional Belief that laboring women are \"connected to things\" that impede movement (Hanson, 2006) Although many labor and birthing facilities claim that all women are allowed to adopt any position of com-fort during their laboring experience, the great majorityof women spend their time on their backs during laborand birth. If the only furniture provided is a bed, this is what the woman will use. Furnishing rooms with comfortable chairs, beanbags, and otherbirth props allows a woman to choose from a variety ofpositions and to be free to move during labor.Take NOTE! Changing positions and moving around during labor and birth offer several benets. Maternal position can in-fluence pelvic size and contours. Changing position andwalking affect the pelvis joints, which may facilitate fetaldescent and rotation. Squatting enlarges the pelvic outletby approximately 25%, whereas a kneeling position re-moves pressure on the maternal vena cava and helps to ro-tate the fetus in the posterior position (Terry et al., 2006).The use of any upright or lateral position, compared withsupine or lithotomy positions, may: Reduce the length of the rst stage of labor Reduce the duration of the second stage of labor Reduce the number of assisted deliveries (vacuum and forceps) Reduce episiotomies and perineal tears Contribute to fewer abnormal fetal heart rate patterns Increase comfort/reduce requests for pain medication Enhance a sense of control by the mother Alter the shape and size of the pelvis, which assists in descent Assist gravity to move the fetus downward (Simkin & Ancheta, 2006) Using the research available can bring better out- comes, heightened professionalism, and evidence-basedpractice to childbearing practices (Walsh, 2007). Philosophy Not everyone views childbirth in the same way. A philo-sophical continuum exists that extends from viewing laboras a disease process to a normal process. One philosophyassumes that women cannot manage the birth experience11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 348adequately and therefore need constant expert monitor- ing and management. The other philosophy assumesthat women are capable, reasoning individuals who canactively participate in their birth experience. The health care system in the United States today appears to be leaning toward the former philosophy, ap-plying technological interventions to most mothers whoenter the hospital system. Giving birth in a hospital in the21st century for many women has become \"interventionintensive\"\u2014designed to start, continue, and end laborthrough medical management rather than allowing thenormal process of birth to unfold. Advances in medical carehave improved the safety for women with high-risk preg-nancies. However, the routine use of intravenous therapy, electronic fetal monitoring, augmentation, and epiduralanesthesia has not necessarily improved birth outcomesfor all women (Leonard, 2007). Perhaps a middle-of-the-road philosophy for intervening when circumstances dic-tate, along with weighing the risks and benets beforedoing so, may be appropriate. During the 1970s, family-centered maternity care was developed in response to the consumer reaction to thedepersonalization of birth. The hope was to shift the phi-losophy from \"technologization\" to personalization to humanize childbirth. The term more appropriate today to denote the low-tech, high-CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 349 touch approach requested by many childbearing women, who view childbirth as a normal process. Certified nurse midwives (CNMs) are champions of family-centered birthing, and their participation in thechildbirth process is associated with fewer unnecessary in-terventions when compared to obstetricians. CNMs sub-scribe to a normal birth process where the woman uses herown instincts and bodily signs during labor. In short, mid-wives empower women within the birthing environment(Russell, 2007; Steppe, 2007). No matter what philosophy is held, it is ideal if every- one involved in the particular birth process\u2014from thehealth care provider to the mother\u2014shares the same phi-losophy toward the birth process. Partners Women desire support and attentive care during laborand birth. Caregivers can convey emotional support by of-fering their continued presence and words of encourage-ment. Throughout the world, few women are left to labortotally alone: emotional, physical, or spiritual supportduring labor is the norm for most cultures (Ballen &Fulcher, 2006). A caring partner can use massage, lighttouch, acupressure, hand-holding, stroking, and relax-ation, can help the woman communicate her wishes to theHodnett, E. D., Gates, S., Hofmeyr, G. J., & Sakala, C. (2007). Continuous support for women during childbirth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007, 3. Art. No.: CD003766. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003766.pub2.Study Historically, women have been attended and supported by other women during labor. However, in recent decades inhospitals worldwide, continuous support during labor hasbecome the exception rather than the rule. Concerns aboutthe consequent dehumanization of the birth experienceshave led to calls for a return to continuous support bywomen for women during labor. This review of studies included 16 trials, from 11 countries, involving over 13,000 women in a wide range of settingsand circumstances. The primary outcome was to assessthe effects, on mothers and their babies, of continuous,one-to-one intrapartum support compared with usual care.The secondary outcome was to determine whether the effects of continuous support are influenced by (1) routinepractices and policies in the birth environment that may affect a woman's autonomy, freedom of movement, andability to cope with labor; (2) whether the caregiver is amember of the staff of the institution; and (3) whether thecontinuous support begins early or later in labor.Findings Women who received continuous labor support were morelikely to give birth \"spontaneously\" (vaginally, without vac-uum or forceps). They were less likely to use pain medica-tions, were more likely to be satised with their experience,and had slightly shorter labors. In general, labor supportappeared to be more effective when it was provided bywomen who were not part of the hospital staff. It also appeared to be more effective when it started early inlabor. No adverse effects were identied. Nursing Implications Knowing the results of this evidence-based study, allnurses should strive to be a real \"presence\" for all of theirlaboring couples. Based on the ndings, continuous nurs-ing support promotes positive birthing outcomes andfewer technical/surgical interventions. Both maternal andfetal well-being is preserved when nurses are present andinvolved during the childbirth experience. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 13.1 Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 349It is difcult to predict how a labor will progress and therefore equally difcult to determine how long a woman'slabor will last. There is no way to estimate the likelystrength and frequency of uterine contractions, the extentto which the cervix will soften and dilate, and how muchthe fetal head will mold to t the birth canal. We cannotknow beforehand whether the complex fetal rotationsneeded for an efcient labor will take place properly. Allof these factors are unknowns when a woman starts labor. There is a trend in health care, however, to attempt to manipulate the process of labor through medicalmeans such as artificial rupture of membranes and aug-mentation of labor with oxytocin (Walsh, 2007). Thelabor induction rate has increased dramatically in theUnited States since the 1980s (Gulmezoglu, Crowther,& Middleton, 2007). Approximately one in ve women are induced or have labor augmented with uterine-stimulating drugs or arti-cial rupture of membranes to accelerate their progress (Bricker & Luckas, 2007). An amniotomy (articial rup-ture of the fetal membranes) may be performed to aug- ment or induce labor when the membranes have notruptured spontaneously. Doing so allows the fetal head tohave more direct contact with the cervix to dilate it. Thisprocedure is performed with the fetal head at 2 station or lower, with the cervix dilated to at least 3 cm. Syntheticoxytocin (Pitocin) is also used to induce or augment laborby stimulating uterine contractions. It is administeredpiggybacked into the primary intravenous line with aninfusion pump titrated to uterine activity. There is compelling evidence that elective induction of labor signicantly increases the risk of cesarean birth,especially for nulliparous women (Simkin & Ancheta,2006). The belief is that many cesarean births could beavoided if women were allowed to labor longer and ifthe natural labor process were allowed to complete the job. The longer wait (using the intervention of patience)usually results in less intervention. The ACOG attributes the dramatic increase in induc- tions in part to pressure from women, convenience for physicians, and liability concerns. They recommend a\"cautious approach\" regarding elective induction untilclinical trials can validate a more liberal use of labor induc-tions (ACOG, 2002). There are medical indications for inducing labor, such as spontaneous rupture of mem- branes and when labor does not start; a pregnancy morethan 42 weeks' gestation; maternal hypertension, diabetes, or lung disease; and a uterine infection (ACOG, 2006). When the laboring woman feels the urge to bear down, pushing begins. Most women respond extremelywell to messages from their body without being directedby the nurse. A more natural, undirected approach allowsthe woman to wait and bear down when she feels theurge to push. Having patience and letting nature takeits course will reduce the incidence of physiologic stress inthe mother, resulting in less trauma to her perineal tissue.staff, and can provide a continuous, reassuring presence, all of which bring some degree of comfort to the laboringwoman (Ballen & Fulcher, 2006). Although the presenceof the baby's father at the birth provides special emotionalsupport, a partner can be anyone who is present to sup-port the woman throughout the experience. Worldwide, women usually support other women in childbirth. Hodnett et al. (2003) reported that the contin-uous presence of a trained female support person ( doula ) reduced the need for medication for pain relief, the useof vacuum or forceps delivery, and the need for cesareanbirths. Continuous support was also associated with aslight reduction in the length of labor. The doula, who isan experienced labor companion, provides the woman andher partner with emotional and physical support and infor-mation throughout the entire labor and birth experience. A similar study in the United States found that nurs- ing care decreases the likelihood of negative evaluationsof the childbirth experience, feelings of tenseness duringlabor, and nding labor worse than expected. Also re-ported were less perineal trauma, reduced difculty inmothering, and reduced likelihood of early cessation ofbreastfeeding (Ballen & Fulcher, 2006). Given the many benets of intrapartum support, la- boring women should always have the option to receivepartner support, whether from nurses, doulas, signicantothers, or family. Whoever the support partner is, he orshe should provide the mother with continuous presenceand hands-on comfort and encouragement. Patience The birth process takes time. If more time were allowedfor women to labor naturally without intervention, thecesarean birth rate would most likely be reduced (Simkin& Ancheta, 2006). The literature suggests that delayinginterventions can give a woman enough time to progressin labor and reduce the need for surgical intervention(American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists[ACOG], 2007). Healthy People 2010 has two goals re- lated to cesarean births in the United States: 1. Reduce the rate of cesarean births among low-risk (full-term, singleton, vertex presentation) womenhaving their rst child to 15% of live births, from abaseline of 18%. 2. Reduce the rate of cesarean births among women who have had a prior cesarean birth to 63% of livebirths, from a baseline of 72% (USDHHS, 2000). We are a long way from achieving these goals, since the current cesarean birth rate in the United States\u201430%\u2014is the highest since these data rst became avail-able from birth certificates in 1989. Cesarean birth isassociated with increased morbidity and mortality for bothmother and infant, as well as increased inpatient lengthof stay and health care costs (CDC, 2007).350 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 350CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 351 (Wood, 2007). Chapter 14 presents a full discussion of pain management during labor and birth. Physiologic Responses to Labor Labor is the physiologic process by which the uterus expelsthe fetus and placenta from the body. During pregnancy,progesterone secreted from the placenta suppresses thespontaneous contractions of a typical uterus, keeping thefetus within the uterus. In addition, the cervix remains rmand noncompliant. At term, however, changes occur in thecervix that make it softer. In addition, uterine contractionsbecome more frequent and regular, signaling the onsetof labor. The labor process involves a series of rhythmic, in- voluntary, usually quite uncomfortable uterine musclecontractions. They bring about a shortening that causeseffacement and dilation of the cervix and a bursting of thefetal membranes. Then, accompanied by both reflex andvoluntary contractions of the abdominal muscles (push-ing), the uterine contractions result in the birth of thebaby (Blackburn, 2007). During labor, the mother andfetus make several physiologic adaptations. Maternal Responses As the woman progresses through childbirth, numerousphysiologic responses occur that assist her to adapt tothe laboring process. The labor process stresses severalof the woman's body systems, which react through nu-merous compensatory mechanisms. Maternal physio-logic responses include: Heart rate increases by 10 to 20 bpm. Cardiac output increases by 10% to 15% during the rst stage of labor and by 30% to 50% during the second stage of labor. Blood pressure increases by 10 to 30 mm Hg during uterine contractions in all labor stages. The white blood cell count increases to 25,000 to 30,000 cells/mm 3, perhaps as a result of tissue trauma. Respiratory rate increases and more oxygen is con- sumed related to the increase in metabolism. Gastric motility and food absorption decrease, which may increase the risk of nausea and vomiting duringthe transition stage of labor. Gastric emptying and gastric pH decrease, increasing the risk of vomiting with aspiration. Temperature rises slightly, possibly due to an increase in muscle activity. Muscular aches/cramps occur as a result of the stressed musculoskeletal system. Basal metabolic rate increases and blood glucose levels decrease because of the stress of labor (Blackburn,2007; Cheng & Caughey, 2007).Patient Preparation Basic prenatal education can help women manage theirlabor process and feel in control of their birthing experi-ence. The literature indicates that if a woman is preparedbefore the labor and birth experience, the labor is morelikely to remain normal or natural (without the need formedical intervention) (Gagnon, 2006). An increasingbody of evidence also indicates that the well-preparedwoman, with good labor support, is less likely to needanalgesia or anesthesia and is unlikely to require cesareanbirth (Risica & Phipps, 2006). Prenatal education teaches the woman about the childbirth experience and increases her sense of control.She is then able to work as an active participant duringthe labor and birth experience (Brodsky, 2006). The re-search also suggests that prenatal preparation may affectintrapartum and postpartum psychosocial outcomes. Forexample, prenatal education covering parenting commu-nication classes had a signicant effect on postpartumanxiety and postpartum adjustment. Prenatal educationshould be viewed as an opportunity to strengthen fami-lies by providing anticipatory guidance and improve fam-ily members' life skills. In short, prenatal education helpsto promote healthy families during the transition to par-enthood and beyond (Polomeno, 2006). Learning about labor and birth allows women and couples to express their needs and preferences, enhances their condence, and improves communication between themselves and the staff.Take NOTE! Pain Management Labor and birth, although a normal physiologic process, can produce signicant pain. Pain during labor is a nearlyuniversal experience. Controlling the pain without harmto the fetus or labor process is the major focus of painmanagement during childbirth. Pain is a subjective experience involving a complex interaction of physiologic, spiritual, psychosocial, cultural,and environmental influences (Smith et al., 2006). Culturalvalues and learned behaviors influence perception andresponse to pain, as do anxiety and fear, both of whichtend to heighten the sense of pain (Walsh, 2007). The chal- lenge for care providers is to nd the right combinationof pain management methods to keep the pain manage-able while minimizing the negative effect on the fetus, the normal physiology of labor, maternal-infant bonding,breastfeeding, and a woman's perception of the labor itself11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 351352 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Respiratory changes during labor help to prepare the fetus for extrauterine respira- tion immediately after birth.Take NOTE! Stages of Labor typically divided into four stages: dilation, expul- sive, placental, and restorative. Table 13.2 summarizesthe major events of each stage. The rst stage is the longest: it begins with the rst true contraction and ends with full dilation (opening) ofthe cervix. Because this stage lasts so long, it is dividedinto three phases, each corresponding to the progressivedilation of the cervix.A woman's ability to adapt to the stress of labor is in- fluenced by her psychological and physical state. Amongthe many factors that affect her coping ability are: Previous birth experiences and their outcomes Current pregnancy experience (planned versus un- planned, discomforts experienced, age, risk status ofpregnancy, chronic illness, weight gain) Cultural considerations (values and beliefs about health status) Support system (presence and support of a valued partner during labor) Childbirth preparation (attended childbirth classes and has practiced paced breathing techniques) Exercise during pregnancy Expectations of the birthing experience Anxiety level Fear of labor and loss of control Fatigue and weariness (Edmonds, 2007) Fetal Responses Although the focus during labor may be on assessingthe mother's adaptations, several physiologic adaptations occur in the fetus as well. The fetus is experiencing laboralong with the mother. If the fetus is healthy, the stressof labor usually has no adverse effects. The nurse needsto be alert to any abnormalities in the fetus' adaptation tolabor. Fetal responses to labor include: Periodic fetal heart rate accelerations and slight decel- erations related to fetal movement, fundal pressure,and uterine contractions Decrease in circulation and perfusion to the fetus secondary to uterine contractions (a healthy fetus isable to compensate for this drop) Increase in arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO 2) Decrease in fetal breathing movements throughout labor Decrease in fetal oxygen pressure with a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) (Kenner & Lott, 2007)Stage two of labor, or the expulsive stage, begins when the cervix is completely dilated and ends with thebirth of the newborn. The expulsive stage can last fromminutes to hours. The third stage, or the placental stage, starts after the newborn is born and ends with the separation and birthof the placenta. Continued uterine contractions typicallycause the placenta to be expelled within 5 to 30 minutes. The fourth stage, or the restorative stage, lasts from 1 to 4 hours after birth. This period is when the mother'sbody begins to stabilize after the hard work of labor andthe loss of the products of conception. The fourth stageis often not recognized as a true stage of labor, but it is acritical period for maternal physiologic transition as wellas new family attachment (Arenson & Drake, 2007). First Stage During the rst stage of labor, the fundamental changeunderlying the process is progressive dilation of the cervix.Cervical dilation is gauged subjectively by vaginal exami-nation and is expressed in centimeters. The rst stageends when the cervix is dilated to 10 cm in diameter and islarge enough to permit the passage of a fetal head of aver-age size. The fetal membranes, or bag of waters, usuallyrupture during the rst stage, but they may have burst earlier or may even remain intact until birth. For the prim-igravida, the rst stage of labor lasts about 12 hours.However, this time can vary widely: for the multiparouswoman, it is usually only half that. During the rst stage of labor, women usually per- ceive the visceral pain of diffuse abdominal cramping anduterine contractions. Pain during the rst stage of laboris primarily a result of the dilation of the cervix and loweruterine segment, and the distention (stretching) of thesestructures during contractions. The rst stage is dividedinto three phases: latent or early phase, active phase, andtransition phase. Latent or Early Phase The latent or early phase gives rise to the familiar signsand symptoms of labor. This phase begins with the startof regular contractions and ends when rapid cervical dila-tion begins. Cervical effacement occurs during this phase,and the cervix dilates from 0 to 3 cm. Contractions usually occur every 5 to 10 minutes, last 30 to 45 seconds, and are described as mild by palpation.Effacement of the cervix is from 0% to 40%. Most womenare very talkative during this period, perceiving their con-tractions to be similar to menstrual cramps. Women mayremain at home during this phase, contacting their healthcare professional about the onset of labor. For the nulliparous woman, the latent phase typically lasts about 9 hours; in the multiparous woman, it lastsabout 6 hours (Cheng & Caughey, 2007). During thisphase, women are apprehensive but excited about thestart of their labor after their long gestational period.11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 352CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 353 Description PhasesFirst Stage Second Stage Third Stage Fourth Stage From 0-10 cm dilation; consists of three phases Latent phase (0-3 cm dilation) - Cervical dilation from 0 to 3 cm - Cervical effacement from 0% to 40% - Nullipara, lasts up to 9 hours; multipara, lastsup to 5-6 hours - Contraction frequency every 5-10 minutes - Contraction duration 30-45 seconds - Contraction intensity mild to palpation Active phase (4-7 cm dilation) - Cervical dilation from 4 to 7 cm - Cervical effacement from 40% to 80% - Nullipara, lasts up to 6 hours; multipara, lastsup to 4 hours - Contraction frequency every 2-5 minutes - Contraction duration 45-60 seconds - Contraction intensity moderate to palpation Transition phase (8-10 cm dilation) - Cervical dilation from 8 to 10 cm - Cervical effacement from 80% to 100% - Nullipara lasts up to 1 hour; multipara, lasts upto 30 minutes - Contraction frequency every 1-2 minutes - Contraction duration 60-90 seconds - Contraction intensity strong by palpationFrom complete dilation (10 cm) to birth ofthe newborn; lastsup to 1 hour Pelvic phase (period of fetal descent) Perineal phase (period of activepushing) - Nullipara, lasts up to 1 hour; multipara, lasts up to 30 minutes - Contraction frequency every2-3 minutes orless - Contraction duration 60-90 seconds - Contraction intensity strong by palpation - Strong urge to push during thelater perinealphaseSeparation and expulsion:coming the birth of the newborn; time of maternalphysiologic adjustment TABLE 13.2 STAGES AND PHASES OF LABOR11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 353Think back to the couple who were sent home from the hospital birthing center. Three days later Kathy awoke with a wet sensation and intense discomfort in her back,spreading around to her abdomen. She decided to go for awalk, but her contractions didn't diminish; instead, theycontinued to occur every few minutes and grew stronger inintensity. She and Chuck decided to go back to the hospitalbirthing center. Was there a difference in the location ofKathy's discomfort this time? What changes will theadmission nurse nd in Kathy if this is true labor? Active Phase Cervical dilation begins to occur more rapidly during the active phase. The cervix usually dilates from 4 to 7 cm,with 40% to 80% effacement taking place. This phase canlast up to 6 hours for the nulliparous woman and 4.5 hoursfor the multiparous woman (Simkin & Ancheta, 2006).The fetus descends farther in the pelvis. Contractions be-come more frequent (every 2 to 5 minutes) and increase induration (45 to 60 seconds). The woman's discomfort in-tensies (moderate to strong by palpation). She becomesmore intense and inwardly focused, absorbed in the seri-ous work of her labor. She limits interactions with those inthe room. If she and her partner have attended childbirtheducation classes, she will begin to use the relaxation andpaced breathing techniques that they learned to cope withthe contractions. The typical dilation rate for the nulli- parous woman is 1.2 cm/hour; for the multiparous woman,it is 1.5 cm/hour (Cunningham et al., 2005). Transition Phase The transition phase is the last phase of the rst stage oflabor. During this phase, dilation slows, progressing from8 to 10 cm, with effacement from 80% to 100%. The tran-sition phase is the most difcult and, fortunately, the short-est phase for the woman, lasting approximately 1 hour inthe rst birth and perhaps 15 to 30 minutes in successivebirths (Walsh, 2007). During transition, the contractionsare stronger (hard by palpation), more painful, and morefrequent (every 1 to 2 minutes), and they last longer (60 to90 seconds). The average rate of fetal descent is 1 cm/hourin nulliparous women and 2 cm/hour in multiparouswomen. Pressure on the rectum is great, and there is astrong desire to contract the abdominal muscles and push. Other maternal features during the transitional phase include nausea and vomiting, trembling extremities, back-ache, increased apprehension and irritability, restlessmovement, increased bloody show from the vagina, inabil-ity to relax, diaphoresis, feelings of loss of control, andbeing overwhelmed (the woman may say, \"I can't take itany more\"). This phase should not last longer than 3 hoursfor nulliparas and 1 hour for multiparas (Cunninghamet al., 2005).354 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH In assessing Kathy, the nurse nds she is 4 cm dilated and 50% effaced with ruptured membranes. In what stage andphase of labor would this assessment nding place Kathy? Second Stage The second stage of labor begins with complete cervical dilation (10 cm) and effacement and ends with the birthof the newborn. Although the previous stage of labor pri-marily involved the thinning and opening of the cervix,this stage involves moving the fetus through the birth canaland out of the body. The cardinal movements of laboroccur during the early phase of passive descent in the sec-ond stage of labor. Contractions occur every 2 to 3 minutes, last 60 to 90 seconds, and are described as strong by palpation. Theaverage length of the second stage of labor in a nullipara isapproximately 1 hour and less than half that time for themultipara. During this expulsive stage, the mother usuallyfeels more in control and less irritable and agitated. Sheis focused on the work of pushing. Traditionally, womenhave been taught to hold their breath to the count of 10,inhale again, push again, and repeat the process severaltimes during a contraction. This sustained, strenuousstyle of pushing has been shown to lead to hemodynamic changes in the mother and interfere with oxygen exchangebetween the mother and the fetus. In addition, it is asso-ciated with pelvic floor damage: the longer the push, the more damage to the pelvic floor (Hanson, 2006). Thenewest protocol from the Association of Women's Health and Newborn Nursing (AWHONN) recommends anopen-glottis method in which air is released during push-ing to prevent the buildup of intrathoracic pressure. Doingso also supports mother's involuntary bearing-down efforts(Roberts, Gonzalez, & Sampselle, 2007). During the second stage of labor, pushing can either follow the mother's spontaneous urge or be directed by thecaregiver. Much debate still exists between spontaneousand directed pushing during the second stage of labor. Al-though directed pushing is common practice in hospitals,there is evidence to suggest that directed pushing shouldbe avoided. Research seems to support spontaneouspushing\u2014when the woman is allowed to follow her owninstincts (Hanson, 2006). Evidence is mounting that themanagement of the second stage, particularly pushing, isa modiable risk factor in long-term perinatal outcomes.Valsalva (holding breath) bearing down and supine mater-nal positions are linked to negative maternal-fetal hemo-dynamics and outcomes. The adoption of a physiologic,woman-directed approach to bearing down is advocated(Roberts, Gonzalez, & Sampselle, 2007). Evidence-based practice focuses on a physiologic approach to the second stage of labor. Behaviors demon-strated by laboring women during this time include push-11223-13_UT4-CH13.qxd 8/4/08 2:55 PM Page 354ing at the onset of the urge to bear down; using their own pattern and technique of bearing down in response to sen-sations they experience; using open-glottis bearing downwith contractions; pushing with variations in strength andduration; pushing down with progressive intensity; andusing multiple positions to increase progress and com-fort. This approach is in stark contrast to management byarbitrary time limits and the directed bearing-down effortsseen in practice today (Hanson, 2006). Laboring down (promotion of passive descent) is an alternative strategy for second-stage management inwomen with epidurals. Using this approach, the fetus de-scends and is born without coached maternal pushing. The second stage of labor has two phases (pelvic and perineal) related to the existence and quality of thematernal urge to push and to obstetric conditions re-lated to fetal descent. The early phase of the secondstage is called the pelvic phase, because it is during thisphase that the fetal head is negotiating the pelvis, rotat-ing, and advancing in descent. The later phase is calledthe perineal phase, because at this point the fetal headis lower in the pelvis and is distending the perineum.The occurrence of a strong urge to push characterizesthe later phase of the second stage and has also beencalled the phase of active pushing (Roberts, Gonzalez,& Sampselle, 2007). The later perineal phase occurs when the mother feels a tremendous urge to push as the fetal head is low-ered and is distending the perineum. The perineumbulges and there is an increase in bloody show. The fetalhead becomes apparent at the vaginal opening but dis-appears between contractions. When the top of the headno longer regresses between contractions, it is said tohave crowned. The fetus rotates as it maneuvers out. Thesecond stage commonly lasts up to 3 hours in a rst laborand up to an hour in subsequent ones (Fig. 13.13). Third Stage The third stage of labor begins with the birth of the new-born and ends with the separation and birth of the pla-centa. It consists of two phases: placental separation andplacental expulsion. Placental Separation After the infant is born, the uterus continues to contractstrongly and can now retract, decreasing markedly in size.These contractions cause the placenta to pull away fromthe uterine wall. The following signs of separation indicatethat the placenta is ready to deliver: The uterus rises upward. The umbilical cord lengthens. A sudden trickle of blood is released from the vaginal opening. The uterus changes its shape to globular.CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 355 Spontaneous birth of the placenta occurs in one of two ways: the fetal side (shiny gray side) presenting rst(called Schultz's mechanism or more commonly called\"shiny Schultz's\") or the maternal side (red raw side)presenting rst (termed Duncan's mechanism or \"dirtyDuncan\"). Placental Expulsion After separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, continued uterine contractions cause the placenta to beexpelled within 2 to 30 minutes unless there is gentle ex-ternal traction to assist. After the placenta is expelled, theuterus is massaged briefly by the attending physician ormidwife until it is rm so that uterine blood vessels con-strict, minimizing the possibility of hemorrhage. Normalblood loss is approximately 500 mL for a vaginal birth and1,000 mL for a cesarean birth (Arenson & Drake, 2007). If the placenta does not spontaneously deliver, the health care professional assists with its removal by man-ual extraction. On expulsion, the placenta is inspected forits intactness by the health care professional and thenurse to make sure all sections are present. If any piece isstill attached to the uterine wall, it places the woman atrisk for postpartum hemorrhage because it becomes aspace-occupying object that interferes with the ability ofthe uterus to contract fully and effectively. Fourth Stage The fourth stage begins with completion of the expulsionof the placenta and membranes and ends with the initialphysiologic adjustment and stabilization of the mother(1 to 4 hours after birth). This stage initiates the post-partum period. The mother usually feels a sense of peaceand excitement, is wide awake, and is very talkative ini-tially. The attachment process begins with her inspect-ing her newborn and desiring to cuddle and breastfeedhim or her. The mother's fundus should be rm and wellcontracted. Typically it is located at the midline betweenthe umbilicus and the symphysis, but it then slowly risesto the level of the umbilicus during the first hour afterbirth (Walsh, 2007). If the uterus becomes boggy, it ismassaged to keep it rm. The lochia (vaginal discharge)is red, mixed with small clots, and of moderate flow. Ifthe woman has had an episiotomy during the secondstage of labor, it should be intact, with the edges approx-imated and clean and no redness or edema present. The focus during this stage is to monitor the mother closely to prevent hemorrhage, bladder distention, andvenous thrombosis. Usually the mother is thirsty andhungry during this time and may request food and drink.Her bladder is hypotonic and thus she has limited sensa-tion to acknowledge a full bladder or to void. Vital signs, the amount and consistency of the vaginal discharge(lochia), and the uterine fundus are usually monitoredevery 15 minutes for at least 1 hour.

Thus, it is difcult to determineexactly why labor begins and what initiates it. /H18546Before the onset of labor, a pregnant woman's body undergoes several changes in preparation for the birthof the newborn, often leading to characteristic signsand symptoms that suggest that labor is near. Thesechanges include cervical changes, lightening, increasedenergy level, bloody show, Braxton Hicks contractions,and spontaneous rupture of membranes. /H18546False labor is a condition seen during the latter weeks of some pregnancies in which irregular uterine con-tractions are felt, but the cervix is not affected. /H18546The critical factors in labor and birth are designated as the 10 P's: passageway (birth canal), passenger (fetusand placenta), powers (contractions), psychological re-sponse, maternal position, philosophy (low tech, hightouch), partners (support caregivers), patience (natu-ral timing), patient preparation (childbirth knowledgebase), and pain control (comfort measures). /H18546The size and shape of a woman's pelvis are determining factors for a vaginal birth. The female pelvis is classiedaccording to four main groups: anthropoid, android,gynecoid, and platypelloid. /H18546The labor process is comprised of a series of rhythmic, involuntary, usually quite uncomfortable uterine musclecontractions that bring about a shortening (effacement)and opening (dilation) of the cervix, and a bursting ofthe fetal membranes. Important parameters of uterinecontractions are frequency, duration, and intensity. /H18546The diameters of the fetal skull vary considerably, with some diameters shortening and others lengthening asthe head is molded during the labor and birth process. /H18546Pain during labor is a nearly universal experience for childbearing women. Having a strong sense of self andmeaningful support from others can often help womenmanage labor well and reduce their sensation of pain. /H18546Preparing mentally for childbirth is important for women to enable them to work with the natural forces of laborand not against them. /H18546As the woman experiences and progresses through child- birth, numerous physiologic responses occur that assist her adaptation to the laboring process. /H18546Labor is typically divided into four stages that are un- equal in length. /H18546During the rst stage, the fundamental change under- lying the process is progressive dilation of the cervix. Itis further divided into three phases: latent phase, activephase, and transition. /H18546The second stage of labor is from complete cervical di- lation (10 cm) and effacement through the birth of theinfant.CHAPTER 13 LABOR AND BIRTHPROCESS 357 /H18546The third stage is that of separation and birth of the placenta. It consists of two phases: placental separationand placental expulsion. /H18546The fourth stage begins after the birth of the placenta and membranes and ends with the initial physiologicadjustment and stabilization of the mother (1-4 hours).

Nurses need to be respectful, available,encouraging, supportive, and professional in dealing withall women. Nursing management for labor and birth involves assessment, comfort measures, emotional support,information and instruction, advocacy, and support forthe partner (Sauls, 2007). The health of mothers and their infants is of critical importance, both as a reflection of the current health statusof a large segment of our population and as a predictorof the health of the next generation. Healthy People 2010 (USDHHS, 2000) addresses maternal health in two objec-tives: reducing maternal deaths and reducing maternalillness and complications due to pregnancy. In addition,another objective addresses increasing the proportion ofpregnant women who attend prepared childbirth classes.(See Chapters 12 and 22 for more information on theseobjectives.) This chapter provides information about nursing management during labor and birth. First, the essentialsfor in-depth assessment of maternal and fetal status dur-ing labor and birth are discussed. This is followed by athorough description of the major methods of promotingcomfort and providing pain management. The chapterconcludes by putting all the information together with adiscussion of the nursing care specic to each stage of labor,including the necessary data to be obtained with the admis-sion assessment, methods to evaluate labor progress duringthe rst stage of labor, and key nursing measures that focuson maternal and fetal assessments and pain relief for allstages of labor. Maternal Assessment During Labor and Birth During labor and birth, various techniques are used to assess maternal status. These techniques provide an ongoing source of data to determine the woman's responseand her progress in labor. Assess maternal vital signs,including temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration,and pain, which are primary components of the physicalexamination and ongoing assessment. Also review the pre-natal record to identify risk factors that may contribute toa decrease in uteroplacental circulation during labor. Ifthere is no vaginal bleeding on admission, a vaginal exam-ination is performed to assess cervical dilation, after whichit is monitored periodically as necessary to identify progress.Evaluate maternal pain and the effectiveness of pain-management strategies at regular intervals during laborand birth. Vaginal Examination Although not all nurses perform vaginal examinations onlaboring women in all practice settings, most nurses work-ing in community hospitals do so because physicians are362 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH not routinely present in labor and birth suites. Since most newborns in the United States are born in communityhospitals, nurses are performing vaginal examinations(American Hospital Association, 2007). Vaginal exami-nations are also performed by midwives and physicians. T A vaginal examination is an assessment skill that takes time and experience to develop; only by doing it frequently in clinical practicecan the practitioner's skill level improve.Take NOTE! The purpose of performing a vaginal examination is to assess the amount of cervical dilation, the percentage ofcervical effacement, and the fetal membrane status andto gather information on presentation, position, station,degree of fetal head flexion, and presence of fetal skullswelling or molding (Fig. 14.1). Prepare the woman byinforming her about the procedure, what information willbe obtained from it, how she can assist with the procedure,how it will be performed, and who will be performing it. The woman is typically on her back during the vagi- nal examination. The vaginal examination is performedgently, with concern for the woman's comfort. If it is theinitial vaginal examination to check for membrane status,water is used as a lubricant. If the membranes have al-ready ruptured, an antiseptic solution is used to preventan ascending infection. After donning sterile gloves, theexaminer inserts his or her index and middle ngers intothe vaginal introitus. Next, the cervix is palpated to assessdilation, effacement, and position (e.g., posterior or an- FIGURE14.1 Vaginal examination to determine cervical dilation and effacement.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 362terior). If the cervix is open to any degree, the presenting fetal part, fetal position, station, and presence of moldingcan be assessed. In addition, the membranes can be eval-uated and described as intact, bulging, or ruptured. At the conclusion of the vaginal examination, the ndings are discussed with the woman and her partner tobring them up to date about labor progress. In addition, thendings are documented either electronically or in writingand reported to the primary health care professional incharge of the case. Cervical Dilation and Effacement The amount of cervical dilation and the degree of cervical effacement are key areas assessed during the vaginal exam-ination as the cervix is palpated with the gloved indexfinger. Although this finding is somewhat subjective,experienced examiners typically come up with similarfindings. The width of the cervical opening determinesdilation, and the length of the cervix assesses effacement.The information yielded by this examination serves as abasis for determining which stage of labor the woman isin and what her ongoing care should be. Fetal Descent and Presenting Part In addition to cervical dilation and effacement ndings, the vaginal examination can also determine fetal descent(station) and presenting part. During the vaginal exami-nation, the gloved index nger is used to palpate the fetalskull (if vertex presentation) through the opened cervixor the buttocks in the case of a breech presentation. Stationis assessed in relation to the maternal ischial spines and thepresenting fetal part. These spines are not protrusionsbut rather blunted prominences at the midpelvis. Theischial spines serve as landmarks and have been designatedas zero station. If the presenting part is palpated higher thanthe maternal ischial spines, a negative number is assigned;if the presenting fetal part is felt below the maternal ischialspines, a plus number is assigned, denoting how manycentimeters below zero station. Progressive fetal descent ( 5 to +4) is the expected norm during labor\u2014moving downward from the negativestations to zero station to the positive stations in a timelymanner. If progressive fetal descent does not occur, a dis-proportion between the maternal pelvis and the fetus might exist and needs to be investigated. Rupture of Membranes The integrity of the membranes can be determined during the vaginal examination. Typically, if intact, the mem-branes will be felt as a soft bulge that is more prominentduring a contraction. If the membranes have ruptured,the woman may have reported a sudden gush of fluid.Membrane rupture also may occur as a slow trickle offluid. When membranes rupture, the priority focus shouldbe on assessing fetal heart rate (FHR) first to identify adeceleration, which might indicate cord compression sec-ondary to cord prolapse. If the membranes are rupturedCHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 363 when the woman comes to the hospital, it is important to ascertain when it occurred. Prolonged ruptured mem-branes increase the risk of infection as a result of ascend-ing vaginal organisms for both mother and fetus. Signs ofintrauterine infection to be alert for include maternal fever,fetal and maternal tachycardia, foul odor of vaginal dis-charge, and an increase in white blood cell count. To conrm that membranes have ruptured, a sample of fluid is taken from the vagina and tested with Nitrazinepaper to determine the fluid's pH. Vaginal fluid is acidic,whereas amniotic fluid is alkaline and turns Nitrazine paperblue. Sometimes, however, false-positive results may occur,especially in women experiencing a large amount of bloodyshow, because blood is alkaline. The membranes are mostlikely intact if the Nitrazine test tape remains yellow toolive green, with pH between 5 and 6. The membranesare probably ruptured if the Nitrazine test tape turns ablue-green to deep blue, with pH ranging from 6.5 to 7.5(Frieden & Chan, 2007). If the Nitrazine test is inconclusive, an additional test, called the fern test, can be used to conrm rupture ofmembranes. With this test, a sample of fluid is obtained,applied to a microscope slide, and allowed to dry. Usinga microscope, the slide is examined for a characteristic fernpattern that indicates the presence of amniotic fluid. Assessing Uterine Contractions The primary power of labor is uterine contractions, which are involuntary. Uterine contractions increase intrauterinepressure, causing tension on the cervix. This tension leadsto cervical dilation and thinning, which in turn eventuallyforces the fetus through the birth canal. Normal uterinecontractions have a contraction (systole) and a relaxation(diastole) phase. The contraction resembles a wave, mov-ing downward to the cervix and upward to the fundusof the uterus. Each contraction starts with a building up(increment), gradually reaching an acme (peak intensity),and then a letting down (decrement). Each contraction isfollowed by an interval of rest, which ends when the nextcontraction begins. At the acme (peak) of the contraction,the entire uterus is contracting, with the greatest intensityin the fundal area. The relaxation phase follows and occurssimultaneously throughout the uterus. Uterine contractions during labor are monitored by palpation and by electronic monitoring. Assessment of thecontractions includes frequency, duration, intensity, anduterine resting tone (see Chapter 13 for a more detaileddiscussion). Uterine contractions with an intensity of 30 mm Hg or greater initiate cervical dilation. During active labor,the intensity usually reaches 50 to 80 mm Hg. Restingtone is normally between 5 and 10 mm Hg in early laborand between 12 and 18 mm Hg in active labor (Gilbert,2007). To palpate the fundus for contraction intensity, place the pads of your ngers on the fundus and describe how11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 363it feels: like the tip of the nose (mild), like the chin (mod- erate), or like the forehead (strong). Palpation of intensityis a subjective judgment of the indentability of the uterinewall; a descriptive term is assigned (mild, moderate, orstrong) (Fig. 14.2).364 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH asymptomatic high-risk women is inadequate for predict- ing preterm birth (Herbst & Nilsson, 2006). This practicecontinues even though numerous randomized trials havefound no relationship between monitoring and actualreduction of preterm labor. In more recent research nd-ings, cervical length is predictive of preterm birth in allpopulations studied. A cervical length less than 25 mmwarrants intervention to improve the health outcomesof pregnant women and their infants (Grimes-Dennis &Berghella, 2007). Performing Leopold's Maneuvers Leopold's maneuvers are a method for determining the presentation, position, and lie of the fetus through the useof four specic steps. This method involves inspection andpalpation of the maternal abdomen as a screening assess-ment for malpresentation. A longitudinal lie is expected,and the presentation can be cephalic, breech, or shoulder.Each maneuver answers a question: What fetal part (head or buttocks) is located in the fundus (top of the uterus)? On which maternal side is the fetal back located? (Fetal heart tones are best auscultated through theback of the fetus.) What is the presenting part? Is the fetal head flexed and engaged in the pelvis? Leopold's maneuvers are described in Nursing Pro- cedure 14.1. Fetal Assessment During Labor and Birth A fetal assessment identies well-being or signs that indi- cate compromise. The character of the amniotic fluid isassessed, but the fetal assessment focuses primarily ondetermining the FHR pattern. Fetal scalp sampling, fetalpulse oximetry, and fetal stimulation are additional assess-ments performed as necessary in the case of questionableFHR patterns. Analysis of Amniotic Fluid Amniotic fluid should be clear when the membranes rup- ture, either spontaneously or articially through an am-niotomy (a disposable plastic hook [Amnihook] is used toperforate the amniotic sac). Cloudy or foul-smelling am-niotic fluid indicates infection. Green fluid may indicatethat the fetus has passed meconium secondary to transienthypoxia; however, it is considered a normal occurrence ifthe fetus is in a breech presentation. If it is determinedthat meconium-stained amniotic fluid is due to fetal hyp-oxia, the maternity and pediatric teams work together toprevent meconium aspiration syndrome. This wouldnecessitate suctioning after the head is born before the in-fant takes a breath and perhaps direct tracheal suctioning FIGURE14.2 Nurse palpating the woman's fundus during a contraction. Frequent clinical experience is needed to gain accuracy in assessing the intensity of uterine contractions.Take NOTE! The second method used to assess the intensity of uterine contractions is electronic monitoring, either exter-nal or internal. Both methods provide an accurate meas-urement of the actual intensity of uterine contractions.Although the external fetal monitor is sometimes used toestimate the intensity of uterine contractions, it is not asaccurate an assessment tool. For woman at risk for preterm birth, home uterine activity monitoring can be used to screen for prelaboruterine contractility so that escalating contractility can beidentied, allowing earlier intervention to prevent pretermbirth. The home uterine activity monitor consists of apressure sensor attached to a belt that is held against theabdomen and a recording/storage device that is carriedon a belt or hung from the shoulder. Uterine activity istypically recorded by the woman for one hour twice daily,while she is performing routine activities. The stored dataare transmitted via telephone to a perinatal nurse, and areceiving device prints out the data. The woman is con-tacted if there are any problems. Although in theory identifying early contractions to initiate interventions to arrest the labor sounds reason-able, research shows that uterine activity monitoring in11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 364CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 365 Nursing Procedure 14.1 PERFORMING LEOPOLD 'SMANEUVERS Purpose: To Determine Fetal Presentation, Position, and Lie 1.Place the woman in the supine position and stand beside her. 2.Perform the rst maneuver to determine presentation. a.Facing the woman's head, place both hands on the abdomen to determine fetal position in the uterinefundus. b.Feel for the buttocks, which will feel soft and irregular (indicates vertex presentation); feel for the head,which will feel hard, smooth, and round (indicates a breech presentation). 3.Complete the second maneuver to determine position. a.While still facing the woman, move hands down the lateral sides of the abdomen to palpate on which sidethe back is located (feels hard and smooth). b.Continue to palpate to determine on which side the limbs are located (irregular nodules with kicking andmovement). 4.Perform the third maneuver to conrm presentation. a.Move hands down the sides of the abdomen to grasp the lower uterine segment and palpate the area justabove the symphysis pubis. b.Place thumb and ngers of one hand apart and grasp the presenting part by bringing ngers together. c.Feel for the presenting part. If the presenting part is the head, it will be round, rm, and ballottable; if it isthe buttocks, it will feel soft and irregular. (continued)11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 365after birth if the Apgar score is low. In some cases an am- nioinfusion (introduction of warmed, sterile normal salineor Ringer's lactate solution into the uterus) is used to di-lute moderate to heavy meconium released in utero to as-sist in preventing meconium aspiration syndrome. Analysis of the FHR Analysis of the FHR is one of the primary evaluation toolsused to determine fetal oxygen status indirectly. FHRassessment can be done intermittently using a fetoscope(a modified stethoscope attached to a headpiece) or aDoppler (ultrasound) device, or continuously with anelectronic fetal monitor applied externally or internally. Intermittent FHR Monitoring Intermittent FHR monitoring involves auscultation viaa fetoscope or a hand-held Doppler device that uses ultra sound waves that bounce off the fetal heart, produc- ing echoes or clicks that reflect the rate of the fetal heart(Fig. 14.3). Traditionally, a fetoscope was used to assessfetal heart rate, but the Doppler device has been found tohave a greater sensitivity than the fetoscope (Edmonds,2007); thus, at present it is more commonly used.366 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Intermittent FHR monitoring allows the woman to be mobile in the first stage of labor. She is free tomove around and change position at will since she isnot attached to a stationary electronic fetal monitor. How-ever, intermittent monitoring does not provide a con-tinuous FHR recording and does not document howthe fetus responds to the stress of labor (unless listeningis done during the contraction). The best way to assessfetal well-being would be to start listening to the FHRat the end of the contraction (not after one) so that latedecelerations could be detected. However, the pressureof the device during a contraction is uncomfortable andcan distract the woman from using her paced-breathingpatterns. Intermittent FHR auscultation can be used to detect FHR baseline and rhythm and changes from baseline.However, it cannot detect variability and types of deceler-ations, as electronic fetal monitoring can (Murray, 2007).Nursing Procedure 14.1 (continued) 5.Perform the fourth maneuver to determine attitude. a.Turn to face the client's feet and use the tips of the rst three ngers of each hand to palpate the abdomen. b.Move ngers toward each other while applying downward pressure in the direction of the symphysispubis. If you palpate a hard area on the side oppositethe fetal back, the fetus is in flexion, because youhave palpated the chin. If the hard area is on thesame side as the back, the fetus is in extension, because the area palpated is the occiput. Also, note how your hands move. If the hands move to-gether easily, the fetal head is not descended into thewoman's pelvic inlet. If the hands do not move togetherand stop because of resistance, the fetal head is engagedinto the woman's pelvic inlet (Dillon, 2007). Doppler devices are relatively low in cost and are not used only in hospitals. They are used in home births and birthing centers, and pregnant women can also purchase them to help reduceanxiety between clinical examinations if they had aprevious problem during pregnancy (Walsh, 2007).Take NOTE! intermittent auscultation to establish a baseline, the FHR is assessed for a full minute after a contraction. Fromthen on, unless there is a problem, listening for 30 secondsand multiplying the value by two is sufcient. If the womanexperiences a change in condition during labor, auscul-tation assessments should be more frequent. Changesin condition include ruptured membranes or the onset ofbleeding. In addition, more frequent assessments occurafter periods of ambulation, a vaginal examination, admin-CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 367 istration of pain medications, or other clinically important events (Hale, 2007). The FHR is heard most clearly at the fetal back. In a cephalic presentation, the FHR is best heard in the lowerquadrant of the maternal abdomen. In a breech presenta-tion, it is heard at or above the level of the maternal umbili-cus ( Fig. 14.4). As labor progresses, the FHR location will change accordingly as the fetus descends into thematernal pelvis for the birthing process. To ensure that AB C DE FIGURE14.4 Locations for auscultating fetal heart rate based on fetal position. ( A) Left occiput anterior (LOA). ( (LSA).11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 367the maternal heart rate is not confused with the FHR, palpate the client's radial pulse simultaneously while theFHR is being auscultated through the abdomen. The procedure for using a fetoscope or Doppler device to assess FHR is similar (see Nursing Procedure 12.1 inChapter 12). The main difference is that a small amountof water-soluble gel is applied to the woman's abdomenor ultrasound device before auscultation with the Dopplerdevice to promote sound wave transmission. This gel isnot needed when a fetoscope is used. Usually the FHR isbest heard in the woman's lower abdominal quadrants; ifit is not found quickly, it may help to locate the fetal backby performing Leopold's maneuvers. Although the intermittent method of FHR assessment allows the client to move about during labor, the infor-mation obtained fails to provide a complete picture of thewell-being of the fetus moment to moment. This leads tothe question of what the fetal status is during the timesthat are not assessed. For women who are considered atlow risk for complications, this period of non-assessmentis not a problem. However, for the undiagnosed high-riskwoman, it might prove ominous. National professional organizations have provided general guidelines for the frequency of assessments basedon existing evidence. The American College of Obste-tricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Institute forClinical Systems Improvement (ICSI), the Associa-tion of Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses(AWHONN) have published guidelines designed to assistclinicians in caring for laboring clients. Their recommen-dations are supported by large controlled studies. Theyrecommend the following guidelines for assessing FHR: Initial 10- to 20-minute continuous FHR assessment on entry into labor/birth area Completion of a prenatal and labor risk assessment on all clients Intermittent auscultation every 30 minutes during active labor for a low-risk woman and every 15 minutesfor a high-risk woman During the second stage of labor, every 15 minutes for the low-risk woman and every 5 minutes for thehigh-risk woman and during the pushing stage(ACOG, 2005; AWHONN, 2006; ICSI, 2007). In several randomized controlled studies comparing intermittent auscultation with electronic monitoring inboth low- and high-risk clients, no difference in intra-partum fetal death was found. However, in each study anurse-client ratio of 1:1 was consistently maintainedduring labor (ICSI, 2007). This suggests that adequatestafng is essential with intermittent FHR monitoring toensure optimal outcomes for the mother and fetus. Thereis insufcient evidence to indicate specic situations wherecontinuous electronic fetal monitoring might result inbetter outcomes when compared to intermittent assess-368 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH ment. However, in pregnancies involving an increased risk of perinatal death, cerebral palsy, or neonatal encephalop-athy and when oxytocin is used for induction or augmen-tation, it is recommended that continuous electronic fetalmonitoring be used rather than intermittent fetal aus-cultation (Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ofCanada, 2006). Continuous Electronic Fetal Monitoring Electronic fetal monitoring uses a machine to produce a continuous tracing of the FHR. When the monitoringdevice is in place, a sound is produced with each heart-beat. In addition, a graphic record of the FHR pattern isproduced. Current methods of continuous electronic fetal mon- itoring were introduced in the United States during the1960s, specically for use in clients considered to be athigh risk. However, the use of these methods graduallyincreased and they eventually came to be used for womenother than just those at high risk. This increased use hasbecome controversial because it is suspected of beingassociated with the steadily increasing rates of cesarean births. Many studies suggest that when compared withstandardized intermittent auscultation, the use of intra-partum electronic fetal monitoring seems to increase thenumber of preterm and surgical births but has no signif-icant effect on reducing the incidence of intrapartum deathor long-term neurologic injury (Lockwood, 2007). With electronic fetal monitoring, there is a continuous record of the FHR: no gaps exist, as they do with inter-mittent auscultation. The concept of hearing and eval-uating every beat of the fetus's heart to allow for earlyintervention seems logical. On the downside, however,using continuous monitoring can limit maternal movementand encourages the woman to lie in the supine position,which reduces placental perfusion. Despite the criticisms,electronic fetal monitoring remains an accurate methodfor determining fetal health status by providing a moment-to-moment printout of FHR status. Various groups within the medical community have criticized the use of continuous fetal monitoring for allpregnant clients, whether high risk or low risk. Concernsabout the efciency and safety of routine electronic fetalmonitoring in labor have led expert panels in the UnitedStates to recommend that such monitoring be limited tohigh-risk pregnancies. However, its use in low-risk preg-nancies continues globally (Gagnon, Meier, & Waghorn,2007). This remains an important research issue. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring can be per- formed externally (indirectly), with the equipment attachedto the maternal abdominal wall, or internally (directly),with the equipment attached to the fetus. Both methodsprovide a continuous printout of the FHR, but they differin their specicity. The efcacy of electronic fetal monitor-ing depends on the accurate interpretation of the tracings,not necessarily which method (external vs. internal) is used.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 368Continuous External Monitoring In external or indirect monitoring, two ultrasound trans-ducers, each of which is attached to a belt, are appliedaround the woman's abdomen. They are similar to thehand-held Doppler device. One transducer, called a toco-transducer, detects changes in uterine pressure and con-verts the pressure registered into an electronic signal thatis recorded on graph paper (Murray, 2007). The toco-transducer is placed over the uterine fundus in the area ofgreatest contractility to monitor uterine contractions. Theother ultrasound transducer records the baseline FHR,long-term variability, accelerations, and decelerations. Itis positioned on the maternal abdomen in the midlinebetween the umbilicus and the symphysis pubis. Thediaphragm of the ultrasound transducer is moved to eitherside of the abdomen to obtain a stronger sound and is thenattached to the second elastic belt. This transducer con-verts the fetal heart movements into beeping sounds andrecords them on graph paper (Fig. 14.5). Good continuous data are provided on the FHR. External monitoring can be used while the membranesare still intact and the cervix is not yet dilated. It is non-invasive and can detect relative changes in abdominalpressure between uterine resting tone and contractions.External monitoring also measures the approximate dura-tion and frequency of contractions, providing a permanentrecord of FHR (Murray, 2007). However, external monitoring can restrict the mother's movements. It also cannot detect short-term variabil-ity. Signal disruptions can occur due to maternal obe-sity, fetal malpresentation, and fetal movement, as wellas by artifact. Artifact describes irregular variations or absence of FHR on the fetal monitor record that resultfrom mechanical limitations of the monitor or electri-cal interference. For instance, the monitor may pick uptransmissions from CB radios used by truck drivers onnearby roads and translate them into a signal. Addition-CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 369 ally, gaps in the monitor strip can occur periodically without explanation. Continuous Internal Monitoring Continuous internal monitoring is usually indicated forwomen or fetuses considered to be at high risk. Possibleconditions might include multiple gestation, decreasedfetal movement, abnormal FHR on auscultation, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), maternal fever, pre-eclampsia, dysfunctional labor, preterm birth, or medicalconditions such as diabetes or hypertension. It involvesthe placement of a spiral electrode into the fetal present-ing part, usually the head, to assess FHR and a pressuretransducer placed internally within the uterus to recorduterine contractions (Fig. 14.6). The fetal spiral electrodeis considered the most accurate method of detecting fetalheart characteristics and patterns because it involves receiving a signal directly from the fetus (Murray, 2007).Trained labor and birth nurses can place the spiral elec-trode on the fetal head when the membranes rupture insome health care facilities, but they do not place the intra-uterine pressure catheter in the uterus. Internal monitor-ing does not have to include both an intrauterine pressurecatheter and a scalp electrode. A fetal scalp electrode canbe used to monitor the fetal heartbeat without monitoringthe maternal intrauterine pressure. Both the FHR and the duration and interval of uterine contractions are recorded on the graph paper. This methodpermits evaluation of baseline heart rate and changes inrate and pattern. Four specic criteria must be met for this type of monitoring to be used: Ruptured membranes Cervical dilation of at least 2 cm FIGURE14.5 Continuous external electronic fetal monitoring device applied to the woman in labor. Electrode ScalpInternal fetal monitorIntrauterine pressurecatheter FIGURE14.6 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 369 Presenting fetal part low enough to allow placement of the scalp electrode Skilled practitioner available to insert spiral electrode (ICSI, 2007) Compared to external monitoring, continuous inter- nal monitoring can accurately detect both short-term(moment-to-moment) changes and long-term variability(fluctuations within the baseline) and FHR dysrhythmias.In addition, maternal position changes and movement donot interfere with the quality of the tracing. Determining FHR Patterns Assessment parameters of the FHR are classied as base-line rate, baseline variability (long-term and short-term),and periodic changes in the rate (accelerations and decel-erations). The nurse must be able to interpret the variousFHR parameters to determine if the pattern is reassuring(indicating fetal well-being) or nonreassuring (indicat-ing fetal problems) to care for the woman effectively duringlabor and birth. Table 14.1 summarizes these patterns. Baseline FHR Baseline fetal heart rate refers to the average FHR that occurs during a 10-minute segment that excludesperiodic or episodic rate changes, such as tachycardia orbradycardia. It is assessed when the woman has no con-tractions and the fetus is not experiencing episodic FHRchanges. The normal baseline FHR ranges between 110and 160 beats per minute (bpm) (National Institute ofChild Health and Human Development [NICHD], 2006).The normal baseline FHR can be obtained by auscultation,ultrasound, or Doppler, or by a continuous internal directfetal electrode.370 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Fetal bradycardia occurs when the FHR is below 110 bpm and lasts 10 minutes or longer (NICHD,2006). It can be the initial response of a healthy fetusto asphyxia. Causes of fetal bradycardia might includefetal hypoxia, prolonged maternal hypoglycemia, fetalacidosis, administration of drugs to the mother, hy-pothermia, maternal hypotension, prolonged umbilicalcord compression, and fetal congenital heart block(Arenson & Drake, 2007). Bradycardia may be benignif it is an isolated event, but it is considered an ominoussign when accompanied by a decrease in long-termvariability and late decelerations. Fetal tachycardia is a baseline FHR greater than 160 bpm that lasts for 10 minutes or longer (NICHD,2006). It can represent an early compensatory response toasphyxia. Other causes of fetal tachycardia include fetalhypoxia, maternal fever, maternal dehydration, amnionitis,drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine), maternalhyperthyroidism, maternal anxiety, fetal anemia, pre-maturity, fetal heart failure, and fetal arrhythmias. Fetaltachycardia is considered an ominous sign if it is accom-panied by a decrease in variability and late decelerations(Hale, 2007). Baseline Variability Baseline variability is dened as normal physiologic variations in the time intervals that elapse between eachfetal heartbeat observed along the baseline in the absenceof contractions, decelerations, and accelerations (Menihan& Kopel, 2008). It represents theparasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Theconstant interplay (push-and-pull effect) on the FHR fromthe parasympathetic and systems produces amoment-to-moment change in the FHR. Because variabil-ity is in essence the combined result of autonomic nerv-ous system branch function, its presence implies that theboth branches are working and receiving adequate oxygen(Hale, 2007). Thus, variability is one of the most importantcharacteristics of the FHR. Variability is described in three ways: minimal or ab- sent, moderate, and marked. Minimal or absent variabil-ity typically is caused by uteroplacental insufciency, cordcompression, Inter-ventions to improve uteroplacental blood flow andperfusion through the umbilical cord include lateral posi-tioning of the mother, increasing the IV fluid rate to im-prove maternal circulation, administering oxygen at 8 to10 L/min by mask, considering internal fetal monitoring,documenting ndings and reporting to the health careprovider. Preparation for a surgical birth may be necessaryif no changes occur after attempting the interventions. Moderate viability indicates that the autonomic and central nervous systems of the fetus are well devel-oped and well oxygenated. It is considered a good signof fetal well-being and correlates with the absence ofsignificant metabolic acidosis (Fig. 14.7). Reassuring FHR signs Moderate variable decelerations Fetal tachycardia with loss of variability Prolonged marked bradycardia (<90 bpm) Severe variable decelerations 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 370Marked variability occurs when there are more than 25 beats of fluctuation in the FHR baseline.Causes of this include cord prolapse hyperstimulation, andabruptio placentae. Interventions include determiningthe cause if possible, lateral positioning, increasing IVfluid rate, administering oxygen at 8 to 10 L/min bymask, discontinuing oxytocin infusion, observing forchanges in tracing, considering internal fetal monitor-ing, communicating an abnormal pattern to the healthcare provider, and preparing for a surgical birth if nochange in pattern is noted (Menihan & Kopel, 2008). FHR variability is an important clinical indicator that is predictive of fetal acid-base balance and cerebral tissueperfusion (Bakker et al., 2007). As the central nervoussystem is desensitized by hypoxia and acidosis, FHRdecreases until a smooth baseline pattern appears. Lossof variability may be associated with a poor outcome.Some causes of decreased variability include fetal hypoxia/acidosis, drugs that depress the central nervous system,congenital abnormalities, fetal sleep, prematurity, andfetal tachycardia (Walsh, 2007).CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 371 erations are transitory increases in the FHR above the baseline associated with sympathetic nervous stimulation.They are visually apparent, with elevations of FHR ofmore than 15 bpm above the baseline, and their durationis less than 2 minutes (NICHD, 2006). They are gener-ally considered reassuring and require no interventions.Accelerations denote fetal movement and fetal well-beingand are the basis for nonstress testing. A deceleration is a transient fall in FHR caused by stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Decel-erations are described by their shape and association toa uterine contraction. They are classied as early, late,variable, and prolonged (Fig. 14.8). Early decelerations are characterized by a gradual decrease in the FHR in which the nadir (lowest point)occurs at the peak of the contraction. They rarely decreasemore than 30 to 40 bpm below the baseline. Typically, theonset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration occur at thesame time as the onset, peak and recovery of the contrac-tion. They are most often seen during the active stage ofany normal labor, during pushing, crowning, or vacuumextraction. They are thought to be a result of fetal headcompression that results in a reflex vagal response with aresultant slowing of the FHR during uterine contractions.Early decelerations are not indicative of fetal distress anddo not require intervention. Late decelerations are transitory decreases in FHR that occur after a contraction begins. The FHR does notreturn to baseline levels until well after the contractionhas ended. Delayed timing of the deceleration occurs, withthe nadir of the uterine contraction. Late decelerationsare associated with uteroplacental insufciency, whichoccurs when blood flow within the intervillous space isdecreased to the extent that fetal hypoxia exists (Bakkeret al., 2007). Conditions that may decrease uteroplacentalperfusion with resultant decelerations include maternalhypotension, diabetes and postmaturity, hyperstimulationvia oxytocin infusion, maternal smoking, anemia, and External electronic fetal monitoring cannot assess short-term variability. Therefore, if external monitoring shows a baseline that is smoothingout, use of an internal spiral electrode should be considered to gain a more accurate picture of the fetalhealth status.Take NOTE! 240 210180150120 906030 100 80 60 40 20 0 FIGURE14.7 Long-term variability (average or moderate). Periodic Baseline Changes Periodic baseline changes are temporary, recurrent changes made in response to a stimulus such as a contrac-tion.

Combinations of FHR patterns obtained by electronic fetal monitoring during labor are not infrequent. Non-reassuring patterns are more signicant if they are mixedand persist for long periods. Other nonreassuring patternsinclude prolonged late decelerations, absent or minimalvariability, bradycardia or tachycardia, and prolongedvariable decelerations lower than 60 bpm. The likelihoodof fetal compromise is increased if various nonreassur-ing patterns coexist, particularly those associated withdecreased baseline variability or abnormal contractionpatterns (ICSI, 2007). Other Fetal Assessment Methods In situations suggesting the possibility of fetal compromise, such as inconclusive or nonreassuring FHR patterns,further ancillary testing such as fetal scalp sampling, fetalpulse oximetry, and fetal stimulation may be used to vali-date the FHR ndings and assist in planning interventions.

They imply some degree of fetal hypoxia. Repetitive late decelerations and late decelerations withdecreasing baseline variability nonreassuring signs.Box 14.1 highlights interventions for decelerations. Variable decelerations present as visually apparent abrupt decreases in FHR below baseline and have an un-predictable shape on the FHR baseline, possibly demon-strating no consistent relationship to uterine contractions.The shape of variable decelerations may be U, V, or W, orthey may not resemble other patterns (Hale, 2007). Vari-able decelerations usually occur abruptly with quick decel-eration. They are the most common deceleration patternfound in the laboring woman and are usually transient andcorrectable (Murray, 2007). Variable decelerations are as-sociated with cord compression. However, they become anonreassuring sign when the FHR decreases to less than60 bpm, persists at that level for at least 60 seconds, and isrepetitive (ICSI, 2007). The pattern of variable decelera-tion consistently related to the contractions with a slow re-turn to FHR baseline is also nonreassuring. Prolonged decelerations are abrupt FHR declines of at least 15 bpm that last longer than 2 minutes but lessthan 10 minutes (NICHD, 2006). The rate usually dropsto less than 90 bpm. Many factors are associated with this11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 372Fetal Oxygen Saturation Monitoring (Fetal Pulse Oximetry) Fetal pulse oximetry measures fetal oxygen saturation directly and in real time. It is used with electronic fetalmonitoring as an adjunct method of assessment when theFHR pattern is nonreassuring or inconclusive. Normaloxygen saturation of a healthy fetus is 30% to 70% (Miller,2007). If the fetal oxygen saturation is reassuring (a trendof more than 30% between contractions), unnecessarycesarean births, invasive procedures such as fetal bloodsampling, and operative vaginal births can be minimized(Peek, Condous, & Nanan, 2007). Any reduction in un-CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 373 necessary interventions during labor and birth has the potential to improve maternal and fetal outcomes andreduce costs. Adequate maintenance of fetal oxygenation is necessary for fetal well-being. Fetal oxygen saturationmonitoring is used for a singleton term fetus in a vertexpresentation, at a 2 station or below, and with a non- reassuring FHR pattern. In addition, the fetal membranesmust be ruptured and the cervix dilated at least 2 cm(Gilbert, 2007). A soft sensor is introduced through thedilated cervix and placed on the cheek, forehead, or tem-ple of the fetus. It is held in place by the uterine wall.The sensor then is attached to a special adaptor on thefetal monitor that provides a real-time recording that isdisplayed on the uterine activity panel of the tracing. Itis a noninvasive, safe, and accurate method for assessingfetal oxygenation. The fetal pulse oximetry traces along the contraction portion of the monitoring strip, so it is easy to see how thesaturation changes with the contraction. This adjunct testcan help support decisions to allow labor to continue orto intervene surgically. Observing the trend of oxygen sat-uration on the tracing and documenting the values on thelabor flow sheet or other medical record forms is crucial.The physician or midwife must be notied if the fetaloxygen saturation becomes nonreassuring (less than 30%between contractions) in conjunction with a nonreassuringFHR pattern. Ongoing communication is needed betweenthe nurse and the primary care provider to enhance thematernal-fetus status. Fetal Stimulation An indirect method used to evaluate fetal oxygenation andacid-base balance to identify fetal hypoxia is fetal scalpstimulation and vibroacoustic stimulation. If the fetus doesnot have adequate oxygen reserves, carbon dioxide buildsup, leading to acidemia and hypoxemia. These metabolicstates are reflected in nonreassuring FHR patterns as wellas fetal inactivity. Fetal stimulation is performed to pro-mote fetal movement with the hope that FHR accelerationswill accompany the movement. Fetal movement can be stimulated with a vibroacoustic stimulator (articial larynx) applied to the woman's lowerabdomen and turned on for a few seconds to producesound and vibration or by tactile stimulation via pelvicexamination and stimulation of the fetal scalp with thegloved ngers. A well-oxygenated fetus will respond whenstimulated (tactile or by noise) by moving in conjunctionwith an acceleration of 15 bpm above the baseline heartrate that lasts at least 15 seconds. This FHR accelerationreflects a pH of more than 7 and a fetus with an intactcentral nervous system. Fetal scalp stimulation is not doneif the fetus is preterm, or if the woman has an intrauterineinfection, a diagnosis of placenta previa (which could leadto hemorrhage), or a fever (which increases the risk of anascending infection) (Gilbert, 2007). During the past decade, the use of fetal scalp sampling has decreased, being replaced by less invasive techniques that yield similarinformation.Take NOTE! BOX 14.1 Interventions for Nonreassuring Decelerations If a patient develops a nonreassuring deceleration pattern such as late or variable decelerations: Notify the health care provider about the pattern and obtain further orders, making sure to document all interventions and their effects on the FHR pattern. Reduce or discontinue oxytocin as dictated by the facility's protocol, if it is being administered. Provide reassurance that interventions are being done to effect a pattern change. Additional interventions specic for a late decelerationFHR pattern would include: Turning the client on her left side to increase placental perfusion Administering oxygen by mask to increase fetal oxygenation Increasing the IV fluid rate to improve intravascular volume Assessing client for any underlying contributing causes Providing reassurance that interventions are to effect pattern change Specic interventions for a variable deceleration FHRpattern would include: Changing the client's position to relieve compression on the cord Providing reassurance that interventions are to effect pattern change Giving oxygen and IV fluids as ordered11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 373Promoting Comfort and Providing Pain Management During Labor Pain during labor is a universal experience, although the intensity of the pain may vary. Although labor and child-birth are viewed as natural processes, both can producesignicant pain and discomfort. The physical causes ofpain during labor include cervical stretching, hypoxia ofthe uterine muscle due to a decrease in perfusion duringcontractions, pressure on the urethra, bladder, and rectum,and distention of the muscles of the pelvic floor (Leonard, 2007). A woman's pain perception can be influenced by her previous experiences with pain, fatigue, pain anticipation,positive or negative support system, labor and birth envi-ronment, cultural expectations, and level of emotionalstress and anxiety (Albers, 2007). The techniques used to manage the pain of labor vary according to geography and culture. For example, someAppalachian women believe that placing a hatchet orknife under the bed of a laboring woman may help \"cutthe pain of childbirth,\" and a woman from this backgroundmay wish to do so in the hospital setting (Bowers, 2007).Asian, Latino, and Orthodox Jewish women may requestthat their own mothers, not their husbands, attend theirbirths; husbands do not actively participate in the birthingprocess. Cherokee, Hmong, and Japanese women will oftenremain quiet during labor and birth and not complain ofpain because outwardly expressing pain is not appropriatein their cultures. Never interpret their quietness as free-dom from pain (Bowers, 2007). Culturally diverse childbearing families present to the labor and birth suites with the same needs and desiresof all families. Give them the same respect and sense ofwelcome shown to all families. Make sure they have a high-quality birth experience: uphold their religious, ethnic,and cultural values and integrate them into care. Today, women have many safe nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic choices for the management of painduring labor and birth, which may be used separately orin combination with one another. Nurses are in an ideal position to provide childbearing women with balanced, clear, concise information abouteffective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic mea-sures to relieve pain. Pain management standards issued by JCAHO mandate that pain be assessed in all clientsadmitted to a health care facility. Thus, it is important fornurses to be knowledgeable about the most recent scienticresearch on labor pain-relief modalities, to make sure thataccurate and unbiased information about effective pain-relief measures is available to laboring women, to be surethat the woman determines what is an acceptable laborpain level for her, and to allow the woman the choice ofpain-relief method. Nonpharmacologic Measures Nonpharmacologic measures may include continuous labor support, hydrotherapy, ambulation and position374 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH changes, acupuncture and acupressure, attention focusing and imagery, therapeutic touch and massage, breathingtechniques, and effleurage. Most of these methods arebased on the \"gate control\" theory of pain, which proposesthat local physical stimulation can interfere with pain stim- uli by closing a hypothetical gate in the spinal cord, thusblocking pain signals from reaching the brain (Arenson& Drake, 2007). It has long been a standard of care forlabor nurses to rst provide or encourage a variety of non-pharmacologic measures before moving to the pharma-cologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic measures are usually simple, safe, and inexpensive to use. Many of these measures are taughtin childbirth classes, and women should be encouragedto try a variety of methods prior to the real labor. Manyof the measures need to be practiced for best results andcoordinated with the partner/coach. The nurse providessupport and encouragement for the woman and her part-ner using nonpharmacologic methods. Although womencan't consciously direct the labor contractions, they cancontrol how they respond to them, thereby enhancing theirfeelings of control. Continuous Labor Support Continuous labor support involves offering a sustainedpresence to the laboring woman by providing emotionalsupport, comfort measures, advocacy, information andadvice, and support for the partner (Gagnon, Meier, &Waghorn, 2007). A woman's family, a midwife, a nurse,a doula, or anyone else close to the woman can providethis continuous presence. A support person can assist thewoman to ambulate, reposition herself, and use breathingtechniques. A support person can also aid with the use ofacupressure, massage, music therapy, or therapeutic touch.During the natural course of childbirth, a laboring woman'sfunctional ability is limited secondary to pain, and sheoften has trouble making decisions. The support personcan help make them based on his or her knowledge of thewoman's birth plan and personal wishes. Research has validated the value of continuous labor support versus intermittent support in terms of loweroperative deliveries, cesarean births, and requests for painmedication (Armstrong & Feldman, 2007). The human presence is of immeasurable value to make the laboring woman feel secure.Take NOTE! Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy is a nonpharmacologic measure in whichthe woman immerses herself in warm water for relaxation11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 374and relief of discomfort. When the woman enters the warm water, the warmth and buoyancy help to release muscletension and can impart a sense of well-being (Koenig,2007). Warm water provides soothing stimulation of nervesin the skin, promoting vasodilatation, reversal of sympa-thetic nervous response, and a reduction in catecholamines(Blackburn, 2007). Contractions are usually less painfulin warm water because the warmth and buoyancy of thewater have a relaxing effect. There are a wide range of hydrotherapy options available, from ordinary bathtubs to whirlpool baths andshowers, combined with low lighting and music. Manyhospitals provide showers and whirlpool baths for laboringwomen for pain relief. However, hydrotherapy is morecommonly practiced in birthing centers managed by mid-wives. The recommendation for initiating hydrotherapy isthat the woman be in active labor (more than 5 cm dilated)to prevent the slowing of labor contractions secondary tomuscular relaxation. The woman's membranes can beintact or ruptured. Women are encouraged to stay in thebath or shower as long as they feel they are comfortable.The water temperature should not exceed body temper-ature, and the bath time typically is limited to 1 to 2 hours(Koenig, 2007). Hydrotherapy is an effective pain-management option for many women. Women who are experiencing a healthypregnancy can be offered this option, but the potentialbenets or risks to the woman are still not known (Fink,Irwin, & Mitchell, 2007). Ambulation and Position Changes Ambulation and position changes during labor are anotherextremely useful comfort measure. Historically, womenadopted a variety of positions during labor, rarely using therecumbent position until recently. The medical professionhas favored recumbent positions during labor, but withoutevidence to demonstrate their appropriateness (Sleutel,Schultz, & Wyble, 2007). Changing position frequently (every 30 minutes or so)\u2014sitting, walking, kneeling, standing, lying down,getting on hands and knees, and using a birthing ball\u2014helps relieve pain (Fig. 14.9). Position changes also mayhelp to speed labor by adding the benets of gravity andchanging the shape of the pelvis. Research has found thatthe position that the woman assumes and the frequency ofposition changes have a profound effect on uterine activityand efciency. Allowing the woman to obtain a positionof comfort frequently facilitates a favorable fetal rotationby altering the alignment of the presenting part with thepelvis. As the mother continues to change position basedon comfort, the optimal presentation is afforded (Gilbert,2007). Supine and sitting positions should be avoided,since they may interfere with labor progress and can causecompression of the vena cava and decrease blood returnto the heart. Swaying from side to side, rocking, or other rhythmic movements may also be comforting. If labor is progressingCHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 375 slowly, ambulating may speed it up again. Upright positions such as walking, kneeling forward, or doing the lunge on thebirthing ball give most women a greater sense of controland active movement than just lying down. Table 14.2highlights some of the more common positions that canbe used during labor and birth. Acupuncture and Acupressure Acupuncture and acupressure can be used to relieve pain during labor. Although controlled research studies ofthese methods are limited, there is adequate evidencethat both are useful in relieving pain associated withlabor and birth. However, both methods require a trained,certified clinician, and such a person is not available inmany birth facilities (Hantoushzadeh, Alhusseini, &Lebaschi, 2007). Acupuncture involves stimulating key trigger points with needles. This form of Chinese medicine has beenpracticed for approximately 3,000 years. Classical Chi-nese teaching holds that throughout the body there aremeridians or channels of energy ( qi) that when in balance regulate body functions. Pain reflects an imbalance orobstruction of the flow of energy. The purpose of acupunc-ture is to restore qi,thus diminishing pain (Koenig, 2007). Stimulating the trigger points causes the release of endor-phins, reducing the perception of pain. Acupressure involves the application of a rm nger or massage at the same trigger points to reduce the painsensation. The amount of pressure is important. The inten-sity of the pressure is determined by the needs of thewoman. Holding and squeezing the hand of a woman inlabor may trigger the point most commonly used for bothtechniques. Some acupressure points are found along thespine, neck, shoulder, toes, and soles of the feet (Armstrong& Feldman, 2007). A Cochrane Collaboration reviewfound that acupuncture may indeed reduce labor pain,but the number of women studied has been small (Smithet al., 2006). Attention Focusing and Imagery Attention focusing and imagery uses many of the senses and the mind to focus on stimuli. The woman can focuson tactile stimuli such as touch, massage, or stroking. Shemay focus on auditory stimuli such as music, humming,or verbal encouragement. Visual stimuli might be anyobject in the room, or the woman can imagine the beach,a mountaintop, a happy memory, or even the contractionsof the uterine muscle pulling the cervix open and the fetuspressing downward to open the cervix. Some women focuson a particular mental activity such as a song, a chant,counting backwards, or a Bible verse. Breathing, relax-ation, positive thinking, and positive visualization workwell for mothers in labor. The use of these techniqueskeeps the sensory input perceived during the contractionfrom reaching the pain center in the cortex of the brain(Armstrong & Feldman, 2007).11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 375376 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH C DA B FIGURE14.9 Various positions for use during labor. ( A) Ambulation. ( B) Leaning forward. (C) Sitting in a chair. ( D) Using a birthing ball. Therapeutic Touch and Massage Therapeutic touch and massage use the sense of touch to promote relaxation and pain relief. Massage works as aform of pain relief by increasing the production of endor-phins in the body. Endorphins reduce the transmission ofsignals between nerve cells and thus lower the perceptionof pain (Blackburn, 2007). In addition, touching and mas-sage distract the woman from discomfort. Therapeutic touch is based on the premises that the body contains energy fields that lead to either good orill health and that the hands can be used to redirect theenergy elds that lead to pain (Arenson & Drake, 2007).To be done correctly, this technique must be learned andpracticed. Some women prefer a light touch, while others nd a rmer touch more soothing. Massage of the neck,shoulders, back, thighs, feet, and hands can be very com-forting. The use of rm counterpressure in the lower backor sacrum is especially helpful for back pain during con-tractions (Fig. 14.10). Contraindications for massageinclude skin rashes, varicose veins, or infections(Leonard, 2007). Effleurage is a light, stroking, supercial touch of the abdomen, in rhythm with breathing during contractions.It is used as a relaxation and distraction technique fromdiscomfort. The external fetal monitor belts may interferewith the ability to accomplish this.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 376CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 377 Standing Walking Standing and leaning forward on partner, bed, birthing ball Slow dancing (standing with woman's arms around partner's neck, head resting on hischest or shoulder, with his hands rubbingwoman's lower back; sway to music andbreathe in rhythm if it helps) The lunge (standing facing a straight chair with one foot on the seat with knee and foot to theside; bending raised knee and hip, and lungingsideways repeatedly during a contraction,holding each lunge for 5 seconds; partnerholds chair and helps with balance) Sitting upright Semi-sitting (setting the head of the bed at a 45-degree angle with pillows used for support) Sitting on toilet or commode Rocking in a chairSitting, leaning forward with supportOn all fours, on hands and knees Kneeling, leaning forward with support on a chair seat, the raised head of the bed, or on abirthing ball Side-lyingTABLE 14.2 COMMON POSITIONS FOR USEDURING LABOR AND BIRTH Takes advantage of gravity during and between contractions Makes contractions feel less painful and be more productive Helps fetus line up with angle of maternal pelvis Helps to increase urge to push in second stage of labor Has the same advantages as standing Causes changes in the pelvic joints, helping the fetus move through the birth canal Has the same advantages as standing Is a good position for a backrub May feel more restful than standing Can be used with electronic fetal monitor Has the same advantages as walking Back pressure helps relieve back pain Rhythm and music help woman relax and provide comfort Widens one side of the pelvis (the side toward lunge) Encourages rotation of baby Can also be done in a kneeling position Helps promote rest Has more gravity advantage than lying down Can be used with electronic fetal monitor Has the same advantages as sitting upright Is an easy position if on a bed Has the same advantages as sitting upright May help relax the perineum for effective bearing down Has the same advantages as sitting upright May help speed labor (rocking movement) Has the same advantages as sitting upright Is a good position for a backrub Helps relieve backache Assists rotation of baby in posterior position Allows for pelvic rocking and body movement Relieves pressure on hemorrhoids Allows for vaginal examinations Is sometimes preferred as a pushing position by women with back labor Has the same advantages as all-fours position Puts less strain on wrists and hands Is a very good position for resting and convenient for many kinds of medical interventions Helps lower elevated blood pressure May promote progress of labor when alternated with walking Is useful to slow a very rapid second stage Takes pressure off hemorrhoids Facilitates relaxation between contractions (continued)11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 377378 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Smith, C.

No.: CD003521. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003521.pub2.Study The pain of labor can be intense, with tension, anxiety, and fear making it worse. Many women would like to laborwithout using drugs and turn to alternatives to managepain. These alternative methods include acupuncture,mind-body techniques, massage, reflexology, herbalmedi cines or homoeopathy, hypnosis, and music. This review examined currently available evidence supportingthe use of alternative and complementary therapies forpain management in labor. Fourteen trials were included in the review, with data reporting on 1,537 women usingdifferent modalities of pain management; 1,448 womenwere included in the meta-analysis. Findings Acupuncture and hypnosis may help relieve labor pain.There is insufficient evidence about the benefits ofmusic, massage, relaxation, white noise, acupressure, and aromatherapy, and no evidence about the effective-ness of massage or other complementary therapies. Insummary, acupuncture and hypnosis may be beneficialfor the management of pain during labor; however, thenumber of women studied has been small. Few othercomplementary therapies have been subjected to properscientific study. Nursing Implications Although this study didn't offer conclusive evidence that alternative therapies for pain management work better thanpharmacologic or invasive methods, they should not bediscounted. Many women wish to avoid articial means to control the discomfort of labor. The nurse should besupportive and open-minded about a woman's efforts tomeet her pain management goals.

If the womanis concentrating on slow-paced rhythmic breathing, sheisn't likely to fully focus on contraction pain. Breathingtechniques are often taught in childbirth education classes(see Chapter 12 for additional information). Breathing techniques use controlled breathing to reduce the pain experienced through a stimulus-responseconditioning. The woman selects a focal point within herenvironment to stare at during the rst sign of a contraction.This focus creates a visual stimulus that goes directly to herbrain. The woman takes a deep cleansing breath, whichis followed by rhythmic breathing. Verbal commands fromher partner supply an ongoing auditory stimulus to herbrain. Effleurage can be combined with the breathing toprovide a tactile stimulus, all blocking pain sensations toher brain. Benets of practicing patterned breathing include: Breathing becomes an automatic response to pain. Breathing increases relaxation and can be used for deal with life's everyday stresses. The steady rhythm of breathing is calming during labor. Breathing provides a sense of well-being and a measure of control. Breathing brings purpose to each contraction, making them more productive. Breathing provides more oxygen for the mother and fetus (American Pregnancy Association, 2007).CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 379 Many couples learn patterned-paced breathing during their childbirth education classes. Three levels may betaught, each beginning and ending with a cleansing breath.In the rst pattern, also known as slow-paced breathing,the woman inhales slowly through her nose and exhalesthrough pursed lips. The breathing rate is typically 6 to 9 bpm. In the second pattern, also called shallow ormodied-paced breathing, the woman inhales and exhalesthrough her mouth at a rate of 4 breaths every 5 seconds.The rate can be accelerated to 2 breaths per second toassist her to relax. The third pattern, pattern paced breath-ing, is similar to modied-paced breathing except that thebreathing is punctuated every few breaths by a forcefulexhalation through pursed lips. All breaths are kept equaland rhythmic and can increase as contractions increase inintensity (Lyon, 2007). Many childbirth educators do not recommend specic breathing techniques or try to teach parents to breathe the\"right\" way during labor and birth. Couples are encour-aged to nd breathing styles that enhance their relaxationand use them. There are numerous benets to controlledand rhythmic breathing in childbirth (outlined above), andmany women choose these techniques to manage theirdiscomfort during labor. Pharmacologic Measures With varying degrees of success, generations of women havesought ways to relieve the pain of childbirth. Pharma-cologic pain relief during labor includes systemic analgesiaand regional or local anesthesia. Women have seen dra-matic changes in pharmacologic pain management optionsover the years. Methods have evolved from biting down ona stick to a more complex pharmacologic approach suchas epidural/intrathecal analgesia. admin- istration of analgesic (opioids) or anesthetic (medicationcapable of producing a loss of sensation in an area of thebody) agents, either continuously or intermittently, intothe epidural for labor (Kuczkowski, 2007). Thisshift in pain management allows a woman to be an activeparticipant in labor. FIGURE14.10 Nurse massaging the client's back during a contraction while she ambulates during labor. Regardless of which approach is used during labor, the woman has the right to choose the methods of pain control that will best suither and meet her needs.Take NOTE! 11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 379Consider THIS! When I was expecting my rst child, I was determined to put my best foot forward and do everything right. I was an experienced OB nurse, and in my mind doingeverything right was expected behavior. I was already2 weeks past my calculated due date and I was becomingincreasingly worried. That particular day I went towork with a backache but felt no contractions. I managed to nish my shift but felt completely wiped out. As I walked to my car outside the hospital,my water broke and I felt the warm fluid run down my legs. I went back inside to be admitted for thismuch-awaited event. Although I had helped thousands of women go through their childbirth experience, I was now the onein the bed and not standing alongside it. My husbandand I had practiced our breathing techniques to copewith the discomfort of labor, but this \"discomfort\" inmy mind was more than I could tolerate. So despitemy best intentions of doing everything right, within anhour I begged for a painkiller to ease the pain. Whilethe medication took the edge off my pain, I still feltevery contraction and truly now appreciate the mean-ing of the word \"labor.\" Although I wanted to usenatural childbirth without any medication, I knowthat I was a full participant in my son's birthing experience, and that is what \"doing everything right\"was for me! Thoughts: Doing what is right varies for each individual, and as nurses we need to support what-ever that is. Having a positive outcome from thechildbirth experience is the goal; the means it takesto achieve it is less important. How can nurses support women in making their personal choices to achieve a healthy outcome? Are any women \"failures\" if they ask for pain medication to toleratelabor? How can nurses help women overcome thisstigma of being a \"wimp\"? Systemic Analgesia Systemic analgesia involves the use of one or more drugs administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously;they become distributed throughout the body via thecirculatory system. Depending on which administrationmethod is used, the therapeutic effect of pain relief canoccur within minutes and last for several hours. The mostimportant complication associated with the use of thisclass of drugs is respiratory depression. Therefore, womengiven these drugs require careful monitoring. Opioids givenclose to the time of birth can cause central nervous systemdepression in the newborn, necessitating the administrationof naloxone (Narcan) to reverse the depressant effects ofthe opioids.380 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Several drug categories may be used for systemic analgesia: Opioids, as secobarbital (Seconal) or pentobarbital (Nembutal) Drug Guide 14.1 highlights some of the major drugs used for systemic analgesia. Systemic analgesics are typically administered par- enterally, usually through an existing intravenous (IV) line.Nearly all medications given during labor cross the pla-centa and have a depressant effect on the fetus; therefore,it is important for the woman to receive the least amountof systemic medication that relieves her discomfort so thatit does not cause any harm to the fetus (Cheng & Caughey,2007). Historically opioids have been administered bynurses, but in the past decade there has been increasinguse of client-controlled intravenous analgesia (patient-controlled analgesia [PCA]). With this system, the womanis given a button connected to a computerized pump onthe IV line. When the woman desires analgesia, she pressesthe button and the pump delivers a preset amount of med-ication. This system provides the woman with a sense ofcontrol over her own pain management and active partic-ipation in the childbirth process. Opioids Opioids are morphine-like medications that are most effec-tive for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Opioids typ-ically are administered IV. Of all of for the management ofpain during labor. Opioids are associated with newbornrespiratory depression, decreased alertness, inhibited suck-ing, and a delay in effective feeding (Bagwell, 2007). Opioids decrease the transmission of pain impulses by binding to receptor site pathways that transmit the painsignals to the brain. The effect is increased tolerance topain and respiratory depression related to a decrease insensitivity to carbon dioxide (Skidmore-Roth, 2007). All opioids are considered good analgesics. However, respiratory depression can occur in the mother and fetusdepending on the dose given. They may also cause a decrease in FHR variability identied on the fetal monitorstrip. This FHR pattern change is usually transient. Othersystemic side effects include nausea, vomiting, pruritus,delayed gastric emptying, drowsiness, hypoventilation, andnewborn depression. To reduce the incidence of new-11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 380born depression, birth should occur within 1 hour or after 4 hours of administration to prevent the fetus from receiv-ing the peak concentration (Cheng & Caughey, 2007). Opioid antagonists such as naloxone (Narcan) are given to reverse the effects of the central nervous systemdepression, including respiratory depression, caused byopioids. Opioid antagonists also are used to reverse theside effects of neuraxial opioids, such as pruritus, vomiting, without significantlydecreasing analgesia (Skidmore-Roth, 2007). Consulta current drug guide for more specifics on these drugcategories.CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 381 Ataractics The ataractic group of medications is used in combi- nation with an opioid to decrease nausea and vomitingand lessen anxiety. These adjunct drugs potentiate theeffectiveness of the opioid so that a lesser dose can be given.They may also be used to increase sedation. Prometh-azine (Phenergan) can be given IV, but hydroxyzine(Vistaril) must be given by mouth or by intramuscularinjection into a large muscle mass. Neither drug affectsthe progress of labor, but either may cause a decreasein FHR variability and DRUG GUIDE 14.1 COMMON SYSTEMIC ANALGESIA Type IV Diazepam (Valium) 2-5 mg IV mg PO/IM (Nembutal) mg PO/IMComments be given IV, intrathecally, or epidurallyRapidly crosses the placentaCan cause maternal and neonatal CNS depressionDecreases uterine contractionsMay be given IV or epidurally with maximal fetal uptake 2-3 hours after administration Can cause CNS depressionDecreases fetal variabilityIs given IVIs rapidly transferred across the placentaCauses neonatal respiratory depressionIs given IVCauses less maternal nausea and vomitingCauses decreased FHR variability, fetal bradycardia and respiratory depression Is given IV or epidurallyCan cause maternal hypotension, maternal and fetal respiratory depression Rapidly crosses placenta Does not relieve pain but reduces anxiety and potentiates opioid analgesic effects Is used to decrease nausea and vomitingIs used for antiemetic effect when combined with opioidsCauses sedation and reduces apprehensionMay contribute to maternal hypotension and neonatal depression Is given to enhance pain relief of opioid and cause sedation May be used to stop eclamptic seizuresDecreases nausea and vomitingCan cause newborn depression; therefore, lowest possible dose should be used Is not used for analgesic but amnesia effectIs used as adjunct for anesthesiaIs excreted in breast milk Causes sedation Is used in very early labor to alter a dysfunctional patternIs not used for pain relief in active laborCrosses placenta and is secreted in breast milk11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 381Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines are used for minor tranquilizing and sedative effects. Diazepam (Valium) also is given IV to stopseizures due to pregnancy-induced hypertension. However,it is not used during labor itself. It can be administeredto calm a woman who is out of control, thereby enablingher to relax enough so that she can participate effectivelyduring her labor process rather than ghting against it.Lorazepam (Ativan) can also be used for its tranquilizingeffect, but increased sedation is experienced with thismedication (Skidmore-Roth, 2007). Midazolam (Versed),also given IV, produces good amnesia but no analgesia.It is most commonly used as an adjunct for anesthesia.Diazepam and midazolam cause central nervous systemdepression for both the woman and the newborn. Barbiturates The barbiturate drug group is used only in early laboror in a prolonged latent phase that produces enough dis- comfort that the woman cannot sleep. Barbiturates aregiven orally or intramuscularly to produce a light sleep toalter a dysfunctional labor pattern or to calm a very anxiouswoman in early labor. The goal in giving a barbiturate isto promote therapeutic rest for a few hours to enhance thewoman's ability to cope with active labor. These drugs crossthe placenta and cause central nervous system depressionin the newborn (Skidmore-Roth, 2007). Regional Analgesia/Anesthesia Regional analgesia/anesthesia provides pain relief with-out loss of consciousness. It involves the use of localanesthetic agents, with or without added opioids, to bringabout pain relief or numbness through the drug's effects on the spinal cord and nerve roots. Obstetric regionalanalgesia generally refers to a partial or complete loss ofpain sensation below the T8 to T10 level of the spinal cord(Edmonds, 2007). The routes for regional pain relief include epidural block, combined spinal-epidural block, local infiltra-tion, pudendal block, and intrathecal (spinal) analgesia/ for episiotomies; epidural and intrathecal routes areused for pain relief during active labor and birth. The majoradvantage of regional pain-management techniques is thatthe woman can participate in the birthing process andstill have good pain control. Epidural Block Approximately 60% of laboring women in the UnitedStates receive an epidural block for pain relief duringlabor. In urban areas, many hospitals approach 90% useof epidurals (Kuczkowski, 2007). An epidural block involves the injection of a drug into the epidural space, which is located outside the duramater between the dura and the spinal canal. The epiduralspace is typically entered through the third and fourth lum-382 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH bar vertebrae with a needle, and a catheter is threaded into the epidural space. The needle is removed and the catheteris left in place to allow for continuous infusion or inter-mittent injections of medicine (Fig. 14.11). An epiduralblock provides analgesia and anesthesia and can be usedfor both vaginal and cesarean births. It has evolved from aregional block producing total loss of sensation to analge-sia with minimal blockade. The effectiveness of epidural analgesia depends on the technique and medications used.It is usually started after labor is well established, typicallywhen cervical dilation is greater than 5 cm. Theoretically, epidural local anesthetics could block all labor pain if used in large volumes and high concentra-tions. However, pain relief is balanced against other goalssuch as walking during the first stage of labor, pushingeffectively in the second stage, and minimizing maternaland fetal side effects. An epidural is contraindicated for women with a previous history of spinal surgery or spinal abnormalities,coagulation defects, infections, and hypovolemia. It alsois contraindicated for the woman who is receiving anti-coagulation therapy. Complications include nausea and vomiting, hypo- tension, fever, pruritus, intravascular injection, and respi-ratory depression. Effects on the fetus during labor includefetal distress secondary to maternal hypotension (Bagwell,2007). Ensuring that the woman avoids a supine positionafter an epidural catheter has been placed will help tominimize hypotension. Changes in epidural drugs and techniques have been made to optimize pain control while minimizing side effects.Today most women receive a continuous lumbar epiduralinfusion of a local anesthetic, typically a drug whose nameends in \"caine,\" and an To have been lowered (Kuczkowski, 2007). The addition of opioids, such as fentanyl or morphine, to the local anesthetic helps decrease the amount of motorblock obtained. Continuous infusion pumps are used toadminister the epidural analgesia, allowing the woman tobe in control and administer a bolus dose on demand(Smiley & Stephenson, 2007). Combined Spinal-Epidural Analgesia Another epidural technique is combined spinal-epidural(CSE) analgesia. This technique involves inserting theepidural needle into the epidural space and subsequentlyinserting a small-gauge spinal needle through the epiduralneedle into the subarachnoid space. An opioid, withouta local anesthetic, is injected into this space. The spinalneedle is then removed and an epidural catheter is insertedfor later use. CSE is advantageous because of its rapid onset of pain relief (within 3 to 5 minutes) that can last up to 3 hours.It also allows the woman's motor function to remain active.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 382Her ability to bear down during the second stage of labor is preserved because the pushing reflex is not lost, and hermotor power remains intact. The CSE technique providesgreater flexibility and reliability for labor than either spinalor epidural analgesia alone (Kuczkowski, 2007). Whencompared with traditional epidural or spinal analgesia,which often keeps the woman lying CSE allowsher to ambulate (\"walking several benets: it mayhelp control pain better, shorten the rst stage of labor,increase the intensity of the contractions, and decreasethe possibility of an operative vaginal or cesarean birth. Although women can walk with CSE, they often choose not to because of sedation and fatigue. Oftenhealth care providers don't encourage or assist womento ambulate for fear of injury (Ros et al., 2007). Cur-rently, anesthesiologists are performing walking epidu-rals using continuous infusion techniques as well asCSE and patient-controlled epidural analgesia (Smiley& Stephenson, vascular injection, accidental intrathecal blockade, post-dural puncture or failed block,and pruritus. Hypotension and associated FHR changes are managed with catheter with an infusionCHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 383 of medication and a programmed pump that allows the woman to control the dosing. This method allows thewoman to have a sense of control over her pain and reachher own individually acceptable analgesia level. Whencompared with the analgesia, with anesthetic use,lower rates of supplementation, and higher client satisfac-tion (Smiley & Stephenson, 2007). With PCEA, the woman uses a hand-held device connected to an analgesic agent that is attached to anepidural catheter. When she pushes the button, a bolusdose of agent is administered via the catheter to reduceher pain. This method allows her to manage her pain atwill without having to ask a staff member to providepain relief. Local Inltration Local inltration involves the injection of a local anesthetic,such as lidocaine, into the supercial perineal nerves tonumb the perineal area. This technique is done by thephysician or midwife just before performing an episiotomy(surgical incision into the perineum to facilitate birth) orbefore suturing a laceration. Local inltration does notalter the pain of uterine contractions, but it does numbthe immediate area of the episiotomy or laceration. Localinltration does not cause side effects for the woman orher newborn. Pudendal Nerve Block A pudendal nerve block refers to the injection of a localanesthetic agent (e.g., bupivacaine, ropivacaine) into the Dura mater Needle removed Catheter remains Spinous process SkinEpidural space A B FIGURE14.11 Epidural catheter insertion.

It provides pain relief in the lower vagina, vulva, and perineum (Fig. 14.12). A pudendal block is used for the second stage of labor, an episiotomy, or an operative vaginal birth with outletforceps or vacuum extractor. It must be administeredabout 15 minutes before it would be needed to ensureits full effect. A transvaginal approach is generally used to inject an anesthetic agent at or near the pudendal nervebranch. Neither maternal nor fetal complications arecommon. Spinal (Intrathecal) into the subarachnoid space to providepain relief during labor or cesarean birth. The contra-indications are similar to those for the epidural block.Adverse reactions for the woman include hypotensionand spinal headache. The subarachnoid injection of opioids alone, a tech- nique termed intrathecal narcotics, has been gaining pop-ularity since it was introduced in the 1980s. A narcotic isinjected into the subarachnoid space, providing rapid painrelief while still maintaining motor function and sensation(Edmonds, 2007). An intrathecal narcotic is given dur-ing the active phase (more than 5 cm dilation) of labor.Compared with epidural blocks, intrathecal narcotics areeasy to administer, provide rapid-onset pain relief, are less384 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH likely to cause newborn respiratory depression, and do not cause motor blockade (Edmonds, 2007). Althoughpain relief is rapid with this technique, it is limited by thenarcotic's duration of action, which may be only a few hoursand not last through the labor. Additional pain measuresmay be needed to sustain pain management. General Anesthesia General anesthesia is typically reserved for emergencycesarean births when there is not enough time to providespinal or epidural anesthesia or if the woman has a contra-indication to the use of regional anesthesia. It can be startedquickly and causes a rapid loss of consciousness. Generalanesthesia can be administered by IV injection, inhalationof anesthetic agents, or both. Commonly, thiopental, ashort-acting barbiturate, is given IV to produce uncon-sciousness. This is followed by administration of a musclerelaxant. After the woman is intubated, nitrous oxide andoxygen are administered. A volatile halogenated agentmay also be administered to produce amnesia (Cheng &Caughey, 2007). All anesthetic agents cross the placenta and affect the fetus. The primary complication with general anesthesiais fetal depression, along with uterine relaxation and poten-tial maternal vomiting and aspiration. Although the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist administers the various general anesthesia agents, thenurse needs to be knowledgeable about the pharmaco-logic aspects of the drugs used and must be aware ofairway management. Ensure that the woman is NPO andhas a patent IV. In addition, administer a non-particulate(clear) oral antacid (e.g., Bicitra or sodium citrate) or aproton pump inhibitor (Protonix) as ordered to reducegastric acidity. Assist with placement of a wedge underthe woman's right hip to displace the gravid uterus andprevent vena cava compression in the supine position.Once the newborn has been removed from the uterus,assist the perinatal team in providing supportive care. Nursing Care During Labor and Birth Childbirth, a physiologic process that is fundamental to all human existence, is one of the most signicant cultural,psychological, spiritual, and behavioral events in a woman'slife. Although the act of giving birth is a universal phenom-enon, it is a unique experience for each woman. Contin-uous evaluation and appropriate intervention for womenduring labor are key to promoting a positive outcome forthe family. The nurse's role in childbirth is to ensure a safe envi- ronment for the mother and her newborn. Nurses beginevaluating the mother and fetus during the admissionprocedures at the health care agency and continue to do FIGURE14.12 Pudendal nerve block.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 384so throughout labor. It is critical to provide anticipatory guidance and explain each procedure (fetal monitoring,intravenous therapy, medications given, and expectedreactions) and what will happen next. This will preparethe woman for the upcoming physical and emotional chal-lenges, thereby helping to reduce her anxiety. Acknowl-edging her support systems (family or partner) helps allaytheir fears and concerns, thereby assisting them in carryingout their supportive role. Knowing how and when to eval-uate a woman during the various stages of labor is essentialfor all labor and birth nurses to ensure a positive maternalexperience and a healthy newborn. A major focus of care for the woman during labor and birth is assisting her with maintaining control over herpain, emotions, and actions while being an active partic-ipant. Nurses can help and support women to be activelyinvolved in their childbirth experience by allowing time fordiscussion, offering companionship, listening to worriesand concerns, paying attention to the woman's emotionalneeds, and offering information to help her understandwhat is happening in each stage of labor. Nursing Care During the First Stage of Labor Depending on how far advanced the woman's labor is when she arrives at the facility, the nurse will determineassessment parameters of maternal-fetal status and plancare accordingly. The nurse will provide high-touch,low-tech supportive nursing care during the rst stage of labor when admitting the woman and orienting her to thelabor and birth suite. Nursing care during this stage willinclude taking an admission history (reviewing the pre-natal record); checking the results of routine laboratorytests and any special tests such as chorionic villi sampling,amniocentesis, genetic studies, and biophysical prole doneduring pregnancy; asking the woman about her childbirthpreparation (birth plan, classes taken, coping skills); andcompleting a physical assessment of the woman to estab-lish a baseline of values for future comparison. Key nursing interventions include: Identifying the estimated date of birth from the client and the prenatal chart Validating the client's prenatal history to determine fetal risk status Determining fundal height to validate dates and fetal growth Performing Leopold's maneuvers to determine fetal position, lie, and presentation Checking FHR Performing a vaginal examination (as appropriate) to evaluate effacement and dilation progress Instructing the client and her partner about monitoring techniques and equipment Assessing fetal response and FHR to contractions and recovery timeCHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 385 Interpreting fetal monitoring strips Checking FHR baseline for accelerations, variability, and decelerations Repositioning the client to obtain an optimal FHR pattern Recognizing FHR problems and initiating corrective measures Checking amniotic fluid for meconium staining, odor, and amount Comforting client throughout testing period and labor Supporting client's decisions regarding intervention or avoidance of intervention Assessing client's support system and coping status frequently In addition to these interventions to promote optimal outcomes for the mother and fetus, the nurse must doc-ument care accurately and in a timely fashion. Accurateand timely documentation helps to decrease professionalliability exposure and minimize the risk of preventableinjuries to women and infants during labor and birth(Walsh, 2007). Guidelines for recording care includedocumenting: All care rendered, to prove that standards were met Conversations with all providers, including notication times Nursing interventions before and after notifying provider Use of the chain of command and response at each level All flow sheets and forms, to validate care given All education given to client and response to it Facts, not personal opinions Initial nursing assessment, all encounters, and discharge plan All telephone conversations (Hamilton & Wright, 2007) This standard of documentation is needed to pre- vent or defend against litigation, which is prevalent in the childbirth arena. Assessing the Woman upon Admission The nurse usually rst comes in contact with the woman either by phone or in person. It is important to ascertainwhether the woman is in true or false labor and whethershe should be admitted or sent home. Upon admission tothe labor and birth suite, the highest priorities includeassessing FHR, assessing cervical dilation/effacement, anddetermining whether membranes have ruptured or areintact. These assessment data will guide the critical think-ing in planning care for the patient. If the initial contact is by phone, establish a therapeu- tic relationship with the woman. Speaking in a calm, caring tone facilitates this. When completing a phone assessment,include questions about the following: Estimated date of birth, to determine if term or preterm Fetal movement (frequency in the past few days)11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 385386 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH the facility has a form that can be used throughout labor and birth to document assessment ndings (Fig. 14.13). Maternal Health History A maternal health history should include typical bio-graphical data such as the woman's name and age and thename of the delivering health care provider. Other infor-mation that is collected includes the prenatal record data,including the estimated date of birth, a history of thecurrent pregnancy, and the results of any laboratory anddiagnostic tests, such as blood type, Rh status, and group Bstreptococcal status; past pregnancy and obstetric history;past health history and family history; prenatal education;list of medications; risk factors such as diabetes, hyper-tension, and use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs; reasonfor admission, such as labor, cesarean birth, or obser-vation for a complication; history of potential domesticviolence; history of previous preterm births; allergies;time of last food ingestion; method chosen for infant feed-ing; name of birth attendant and pediatrician; and painmanagement plan. Ascertaining this information is important so that an individualized plan of care can be developed for thewoman. If, for example, the woman's due date is still 2 months away, it is important to establish this informa-tion so interventions can be initiated to arrest the laborimmediately or notify the intensive perinatal team to beavailable. In addition, if the woman is a diabetic, it is crit-ical to monitor her glucose levels during labor, to preparefor a surgical birth if dystocia of labor occurs, and to alertthe newborn nursery of potential hypoglycemia in thenewborn after birth. By collecting important informationabout each woman they care for, nurses can help improvethe outcomes for all concerned. Be sure to observe the woman's emotions, support system, verbal interaction, body language and posture,perceptual acuity, and energy level. Also note her culturalbackground and language spoken. This psychosocial infor-mation provides cues about the woman's emotional state,culture, and communication systems. For example, ifthe woman arrives at the labor and birth suite extremely anxious, alone, and unable to communicate in English, howcan the nurse meet her needs and plan her care appropri-ately? It is only by assessing each woman physically andpsychosocially that the nurse can make astute decisionsregarding proper care. In this case, an interpreter wouldbe needed to assist in the communication process betweenthe staff and the woman to initiate proper care. It is important to acknowledge and try to understand the cultural differences in women with cultural back-grounds different from that of the nurse. Attitudes towardchildbirth are heavily influenced by the culture in which thewoman has been raised. As a result, within every society,specic attitudes and values shape the woman's child-bearing behaviors. Be aware of what these are. Whencarrying out a cultural assessment during the admission Other premonitory signs of labor experienced Parity, gravida, and previous childbirth experiences Time from start of labor to birth in previous labors Characteristics of contractions, including frequency, duration, and intensity Appearance of any vaginal bloody show Membrane status (ruptured or intact) Presence of supportive adult in household or if she is alone When speaking with the woman over the telephone, review the signs and symptoms that denote true versusfalse labor, and suggest various positions she can assumeto provide comfort and increase placental perfusion. Alsosuggest walking, massage, and taking a warm shower topromote relaxation. Outline what foods and fluids areappropriate for oral intake in early labor. Throughout thephone call, listen to the woman's concerns and answerany questions clearly. Reducing the risk of liability exposure and avoiding preventable injuries to mothers and fetuses during laborand birth can be accomplished by adhering to two basictenets of clinical practice: (1) use applicable evidenceand/or published standards and guidelines as the founda-tion of care, and (2) whenever a clinical choice is presented,chose client safety (Collins, 2006). With these two tenetsin mind, advise the woman on the phone to contact herhealth care provider for further instructions or to come tothe facility to be evaluated, since ruling out true labor andpossible maternal-fetal complications cannot be doneaccurately over the phone. Additional nursing responsibilities associated with a phone assessment include: Consulting the woman's prenatal record for parity status, estimated date of birth, and untoward events Calling the health care provider to inform him or her of the woman's status Preparing for admission to the perinatal unit to ensure adequate staff assignment Notifying the admissions ofce of a pending admission If the nurse's rst encounter with the woman is in person, an assessment is completed to determine whethershe should be admitted to the perinatal unit or sent homeuntil her labor advances. Entering a facility is often anintimidating and stressful event for women since it is anunfamiliar environment. Giving birth for the rst time isa pivotal event in the lives of most women. Therefore,demonstrate respect when addressing the client; listencarefully and express interest and concern. Nurses mustvalue and respect women and promote their self-worthand sense of control by allowing them to participate inmaking decisions (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). An admission assessment includes maternal health history, physical assessment, fetal assessment, laboratorystudies, and assessment of psychological status.

Physical Examination The physical examination typically includes a general-ized assessment of the woman's body systems, including hydration status, vital signs, auscultation of heart andlung sounds, and measurement of height and weight.The physical examination also includes the followingassessments: Fundal height measurement Uterine activity, including contraction frequency, duration, and intensity Status of membranes (intact or ruptured) Cervical dilatation and degree of effacement Fetal status, including heart rate, position, and station Pain level These assessment parameters form a baseline against which the nurse can compare all future values through-out labor. The ndings should be similar to those of thewoman's prepregnancy and pregnancy ndings, with theexception of her pulse rate, which might be elevated sec-ondary to her anxious state with beginning labor. Laboratory Studies On admission, laboratory studies typically are done toestablish a baseline. Although the exact tests may vary among facilities, they usually include a urinalysis via clean-catch urine specimen and complete blood count (CBC).Blood typing and Rh factor analysis may be necessary if theresults of these are unknown or unavailable. In addition,if the following test results are not included in the mater-nal prenatal history, it may be necessary to perform themat this time. They include syphilis screening, hepatitis B(HbsAg) screening, group B streptococcus, HIV testing388 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH (if woman gives consent), and possible drug screening if the history is positive. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a gram-positive organism that is present in 10% to 30% of all healthywomen (Kenner & Lott, 2007). These women are asymp-tomatic carriers but can cause GBS disease of the new-born through vertical transmission. The mortality rate ofinfected newborns varies according to time of onset (earlyor late). Risk factors for GBS include maternal intrapartumfever, prolonged ruptured membranes, previous birth ofan infected newborn, and GBS bacteriuria in the presentpregnancy. In 2002 ACOG and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued guidelines that advised universal screening of pregnant women at 35 to 37 weeks' gestationfor GBS and intrapartum antibiotic therapy for GBS carri-ers (Reingold et al., 2007). Maternal infections associatedwith GBS include acute chorioamnionitis, endometritis,and urinary tract infection. Neonatal clinical manifes-tations include pneumonia and sepsis. Identified GBScarriers receive IV antibiotic prophylaxis (penicillin G orampicillin) at the onset of labor or ruptured membranes. If her HIV status is not documented, the woman being admitted to the labor and birth suite should have rapidHIV testing done. To reduce perinatal transmission, HIV-positive women are given zidovudine (2 mg/kg IV over anhour, and then a maintenance infusion of 1 mg/kg perhour until birth) or a single 200-mg oral dose of nevirapineat the onset of labor; the newborn is given 2 mg/kg orallybetween 48 and 72 hours of life (Kenner & Lott, 2007).To further reduce the risk of perinatal transmission,ACOG and the U.S. Public Health Service recommendthat HIV-infected women with plasma viral loads of morethan 1,000 copies per milliliter be counseled regarding thebenets of elective cesarean birth (Jamieson et al., 2007).Additional interventions to reduce the transmission riskwould include avoiding use of scalp electrode for fetalmonitoring or doing a scalp blood sampling for fetal pH,delaying amniotomy, and avoiding invasive proceduressuch as forceps or vacuum-assisted devices. The nursestresses the importance of all interventions and the goalto reduce transmission of HIV to the newborn. Continuing Assessment During the First Stage of Labor After the admission assessment is complete, assessment continues for changes that would indicate that labor isprogressing as expected. Assess the woman's knowledge,experience, and expectations of labor. Typically, bloodpressure, pulse, and respirations are assessed every hourduring the latent phase of labor unless the clinical situa-tion dictates that vital signs be taken more frequently.During the active and transition phases, they are assessedevery 30 minutes. The temperature is taken every 4 hoursthroughout the rst stage of labor unless the clinical situa-tion dictates more frequent measurement (maternal fever).BOX 14.2 Questions for Providing Culturally Competent Care During Labor and Birth Where were you born? How long have you lived in the Untied States? What languages do you speak and read? Who are your major support people? What are your religious practices? How do you view childbearing? Are there any special precautions or restrictions that are important? Is birth considered a private or a social experience? How would you like to manage your labor discomfort? Who will provide your labor 388Vaginal examinations are performed periodically to track labor progress. This assessment information is shared with the woman to reinforce that she is making progresstoward the goal of birth. Uterine contractions are moni-tored for frequency, duration, and intensity every 30 to60 minutes during the latent phase, every 15 to 30 minutesduring the active phase, and every 15 minutes duringtransition. Note the changes in the character of the con-tractions as labor progresses, and inform the woman ofher progress. Continually determine the woman's level ofpain and her ability to cope and use relaxation techniqueseffectively. When the fetal membranes rupture, spontaneously or artificially, assess the FHR and check the amnioticfluid for color, odor, and amount. Assess the FHR inter-mittently or continuously via electronic monitoring. Dur-ing the latent phase of labor, assess the FHR every 30 to60 minutes; in the active phase, assess FHR at least every15 to 30 minutes. Also, be sure to assess the FHR beforeambulation, prior to any procedure, and prior to admin-istering analgesia or anesthesia to the mother. Table 14.3summarizes assessments for the rst stage of labor. Remember Sheila from the chapter-opening scenario? What is the nurse's role with Sheila in active labor? What additional comfort measures can the labor nurseoffer Sheila?CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 389 Nursing Interventions Nursing interventions during the admission process should include: Asking about the client's expectations of the birthing process Providing information about labor, birth, pain- management options, and relaxation techniques Presenting information about fetal monitoring equipment and the procedures needed Monitoring FHR and identifying patterns that need further intervention Monitoring the mother's vital signs to obtain a baseline for later comparison Reassuring the client that her labor progress will be monitored closely and nursing care will focus on ensuring fetal and maternal well-being throughout As the woman progresses through the rst stage of labor, nursing interventions include: Encouraging the woman's partner to participate Keeping the woman and her partner up to date on the progress of the labor Orienting the woman and her partner to the labor and birth unit and explaining all of the birthing procedures Providing clear fluids (e.g., ice chips) as needed or requested Maintaining the woman's parenteral fluid intake at the prescribed rate if she has an IV Vital signs (BP, pulse, respirations) TemperatureContractions (frequency, duration, intensity) Fetal heart rate Vaginal examination Behavior/psychosocialAssessments* Latent Phase (0-3 cm) Active Phase (4-7 cm) Transition (8-10 cm) Every 30-60 min Every 4 hours Every 30-60 min by palpation or continuously if EFM Every hour by Doppler or continuously by EFM Initially on admission to determine phase and asneeded based on maternalcues to document laborprogression With every client encounter: talkative, excited, anxiousEvery 30 min Every 4 hours Every 15-30 min by palpation or continuously if EFM Every 30 min by Doppler or continuously by EFM As needed to monitor labor progression With every client encounter: self-absorbed in labor; intense and quiet nowEvery 15-30 min Every 4 hours Every 15 min by palpation or continuously if EFM Every 15-30 min by Doppler or continuouslyby EFM As needed to monitor labor progression With every client encounter: discouraged,irritable, feels out of control, decliningcoping abilityTABLE 14.3 SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS DURING THE FIRSTSTAGE OF LABOR *The frequency of assessments is dictated by the health status of the woman and fetus and can be altered if either one of their conditions changes.

Remember Sheila, who was admitted in active labor? She has progressed to the transition phase (8 cm dilated) and is becoming increasingly more uncomfortable. She isusing a patterned-paced breathing pattern now but thrashingaround in the hospital bed. Nursing Management During the Second Stage of Labor Nursing care during the second stage of labor focuses on supporting the woman and her partner in making activedecisions about her care and labor management, imple-menting strategies to prolong the early passive phase of fetal descent, supporting involuntary bearing-downefforts, providing instruction and assistance, and usingmaternal positions that can enhance descent and reducepain (Sleutel, Schultz, & Wyble, 2007). Research suggeststhat strong pushing during the second stage may be accom-panied by a signicant decline in fetal pH and may causematernal muscle and nerve damage if done too early(Sauls, 2007). Shortening the phase of active pushingand lengthening the early phase of passive descent canbe achieved by encouraging the woman not to push untilshe has a strong desire to do so and until the descent androtation of the fetal head are well advanced. EffectiveTEACHING GUIDELINES 14.1 Positioning During the First Stage of Labor Walking with support from your partner (adds the force of gravity to contractions to promote fetal descent) Slow-dancing position with your partner holdingyou (adds the force of gravity to contractions andpromotes support from and active participation ofyour partner) Side-lying with pillows between the knees for com-fort (offers a restful position and improves oxygenflow to the uterus) Semi-sitting in bed or on a couch leaning againstthe partner (reduces back pain because fetus fallsforward, away from the sacrum) Sitting in a chair with one foot on the floor and oneon the chair (changes pelvic shape) Leaning forward by straddling a chair, a table, or a bed or kneeling over a birth ball (reduces backpain, adds the force of gravity to promote descent;possible pain relief if partner can apply sacral pressure) Sitting in a rocking chair or on a birth ball andshifting weight back and forth (provides comfortbecause rocking motion is soothing; uses the forceof gravity to help fetal descent) Lunge by rocking weight back and forth with footup on chair during contraction (uses force of gravityby being upright; enhances rotation of fetusthrough rocking) Open knee-chest position (helps to relieve back discomfort) (Armstrong & Feldman, 2007) 11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 390CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 391 Nursing Care Plan 14.1 OVERVIEW OF THE WOMAN IN THE ACTIVEPHASE OF THE FIRSTSTAGE OF LABOR Candice, a 23-year-old gravida 1, para 0 (G1,P0) is admitted to the labor and birth suite at 39 weeks' gestation having contractions of moderate intensity every 5 to 6 minutes. A vaginal examination reveals her cervix is 80% effaced and 5 cm dilated. The presenting part (vertex) is at 0 station and her membranes ruptured spontaneously 4 hours ago athome. She is admitted and an IV is started for hydration and vascular access. An external fetal monitor is applied. FHR is 140 bpm and regular. Her partner is present at her bedside. Candice is now in the active phase of the first stageof labor, and her assessment findings are as follows: cervix dilated 7 cm, 80% effaced; moderate to strong contrac-tions occurring regularly, every 3 to 5 minutes, lasting 45 to 60 seconds; at 0 station on pelvic examination; FHR aus-cultated loudest below umbilicus at 140 bpm; vaginal show\u2014pink or bloody vaginal mucus; currently apprehensive,inwardly focused, with increased dependency; voicing concern about ability to cope with pain; limited ability to followdirections. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to labor and birth process and fear of the unknown related to client's rst experience Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will remain calm and in control as evidenced by ability to make decisions and use positive coping strategies. Interventions: Promoting Positive Coping Strategies Provide instruction regarding the labor process to allay anxiety. Reorient the woman to the physical environment and equipment as necessary to keep her informed of events. Encourage verbalization of feelings and concerns to reduce anxiety. Listen attentively to woman and partner to demonstrate interest and concern. Inform woman and partner of standard procedures/processes to ensure adequate understanding of events and procedures. Frequently update woman of progress and labor status to provide positive reinforcement for actions. Reinforce relaxation techniques and provide instruction if needed to aid in coping. Encourage participation of the partner in the coaching role; role-model to facilitate partner participation in labor process to provide support and encouragement to the client. Provide a presence and remain with woman as much as possible to provide comfort and support. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Pain related to effects of contractions and cervical dilatation and events of labor Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will maintain a tolerable level of pain and discomfort as evidenced by statements of pain relief, pain rating of 2 or less on pain rating scale, and absence of adverse effects in client and fetus from analgesia or anesthesia. Interventions: Providing Pain Relief Monitor vital signs, observe for signs of pain, and have client rate pain on a scale of 0 to 10 to provide baseline for comparison. Encourage client to void every 1 to 2 hours to decrease pressure from a full bladder. Assist woman to change positions frequently to increase comfort and promote labor progress. Encourage use of distraction to reduce focus on contraction pain. Suggest pelvic rocking, massage, or back counterpressure to reduce pain. Assist with use of relaxation and breathing techniques to promote relaxation. Use touch appropriately (backrub) when desired by the woman to promote comfort. Integrate use of nonpharmacologic measures for pain relief, such as warm water, birthing ball, or other techniques to facilitate pain relief. Administer pharmacologic agents as ordered when requested to control pain. Provide reassurance and encouragement between contractions to foster self-esteem and continued participation in laborprocess. (continued)11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 391pushing can be achieved by assisting the woman to assume a more upright or squatting position (Hanson, 2006). Perineal lacerations or tears can occur during the second stage when the fetal head emerges through thevaginal introitus. The extent of the laceration is laceration fourth-degreelaceration also involves the anterior rectal wall. Specialattention needs to be paid to third- and fourth-degreelacerations to prevent fecal incontinence (Lowder et al., 2007). The primary care provider should repair any lac-erations during the third stage of labor. An episiotomy is an incision made in the perineum to enlarge the vaginal outlet and theoretically to shortenthe second stage of labor. Alternative measures such aswarm compresses and continual massage with oil havebeen successful in stretching the perineal area to preventcutting it. Certied nurse midwives (CNMs) can cut andrepair episiotomies, but they frequently use alternativemeasures if possible.392 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk of infection related to vaginal examinations following rupture of membranes Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will remain free of infection as evidenced by absence of signs and symptoms of infection, vital signs and FHR within acceptable parameters, lab test results within normal limits, and clear amniotic fluid without odor. Interventions: Preventing Infection Monitor vital signs (every 1 to 2 hours after ROM) and FHR frequently as per protocol to allow for early detection ofproblems; report fetal tachycardia (early sign of maternal infection) to ensure prompt treatment. Provide frequent perineal care and pad changes to maintain good perineal hygiene. Change linens and woman's gown as needed to maintain cleanliness. Ensure that vaginal examinations are performed only when needed to prevent introducing pathogens into the vaginal vault. Monitor lab test results such as white blood cell count to assess for elevations indicating infection. Use aseptic technique for all invasive procedures to prevent infection transmission. Carry out good handwashing techniques before and after procedures and use standard precautions as appropriate tominimize risk of infection transmission. Document amniotic fluid characteristics\u2014color, odor\u2014to establish baseline for comparison.Nursing Care Plan 14.1 (continued) Further research needs to be done to validate the efcacy of natural measures versus the episiotomy.Take NOTE! The midline episiotomy is the most commonly used one in the United States because it can be easily repairedand causes the least amount of pain (Albers & Borders,2007). Figure 14.14 shows episiotomy locations. Assessment Assessment is continuous during the second stage of labor.Hospital policies dictate the specific type and timing ofassessments, as well as the way in which they are docu-mented. Assessment involves identifying the signs typicalof the second stage of labor, including: Increase in apprehension or irritability Spontaneous rupture of membranes Sudden appearance of sweat on upper lip Increase in blood-tinged show Low grunting sounds from the woman Complaints of rectal and perineal pressure Beginning of involuntary bearing-down efforts Other ongoing assessments include the contraction frequency, duration, and intensity; maternal vital signsevery 5 to 15 minutes; fetal response to labor as indicatedby FHR monitor strips; amniotic fluid for color, odor, membranes are ruptured; and the womanand her partner's coping status (Table 14.4). Assessment also focuses on determining the progress of labor. Associated signs include bulging of the perineum,labial separation, advancing and retreating of the new-born's head during and between bearing-down efforts,11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:56 PM Page 392and crowning (fetal head is visible at vaginal opening; Fig. 14.15). A vaginal examination is completed to determine if it is appropriate for the woman to push. Pushing is appropri-ate if the cervix has fully dilated to 10 cm and the womanfeels the urge to do so.CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 393 Nursing Interventions Nursing interventions during this stage focus on motivat- ing the woman, encouraging her to put all her efforts topushing this newborn to the outside world, and giving herfeedback on her progress.

During the second stage of labor, an ideal position would be one that opens the pelvic outlet as wide as pos-sible, provides a smooth pathway for the fetus to descendthrough the birth canal, takes advantage of gravity to assistthe fetus to descend, and gives the mother a sense of beingsafe and in control of the labor process (Hanson, 2006).Some suggestions for positions in the second stage include: Lithotomy with feet up in stirrups: most convenient position for caregivers Semi-sitting with pillows underneath knees, arms, and back Lateral/side-lying with curved back and upper leg supported by partner Sitting on birthing stool: opens pelvis, enhances the pull of gravity, and helps with pushing Squatting/supported squatting: gives the woman a sense of control Kneeling with hands on bed and knees comfortably apart Other important nursing interventions during the sec- ond stage include: Providing continuous comfort measures such as mouth care, position changes, changing bed linen and under-pads, and providing a quiet, focused environment Instructing the woman on the following bearing-down positions and techniques:394 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Pushing only when she feels an urge to do so Using abdominal muscles when bearing down Using short pushes of 6 to 7 seconds Focusing attention on the perineal area to visualize the newborn Relaxing and conserving energy between contractions Pushing several times with each contraction Pushing with an open glottis and slight exhalation (Roberts, Gonzalez, & Sampselle, 2007) Continuing to monitor contraction and FHR patterns to identify problems Providing brief, explicit directions throughout this stage Continuing to provide psychosocial support by reassuring and coaching Facilitating the upright position to encourage the fetus to descend Continuing to assess blood pressure, pulse, respirations, uterine contractions, bearing-down efforts, FHR, coping status of the client and her partner Providing pain management if needed Providing a continuous nursing presence Offering praise for the client's efforts Preparing for and assisting with delivery by: Notifying the health care provider of the estimated time frame for birth Preparing the delivery bed and positioning client Preparing the perineal area according to the facility's protocol Offering a mirror and adjusting it so the woman can watch the birth Explaining all procedures and equipment to the client and her partner Setting up delivery instruments needed while maintaining sterility Receiving newborn and transporting him or her to a warming environment, or covering the newborn witha warmed blanket on the woman's abdomen Providing initial care and assessment of the newborn (see the Birth section that follows) Sheila is completely dilated now and experiencing the urge to push. How can the nurse help Sheila with herpushing efforts? What additional interventions can the labornurse offer Sheila now? Birth The second stage of labor ends with the birth of the newborn. The maternal position for birth varies from thestandard lithotomy position to side-lying to squatting tostanding or kneeling, depending on the birthing location,the woman's preference, and standard protocols. Once thewoman is positioned for birth, cleanse the vulva and per-ineal areas. The primary health care provider then takescharge after donning protective eyewear, masks, gowns,and gloves and performing hand hygiene. FIGURE14.15 Crowning.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 394Once the fetal head has emerged, the primary care provider explores the fetal neck to see if the umbilicalcord is wrapped around it. If it is, the cord is slipped overthe head to facilitate delivery. As soon as the head emerges,the health care provider suctions the newborn's mouthrst (because the newborn is an obligate nose breather)and then the nares with a Theumbilical cord is double-clamped and cut between theclamps. With the rst cries of the newborn, the secondstage of labor ends. In addition to encouraging Sheila to rest between pushing and offering praise for her efforts, what is the nurse's roleduring the birthing process? Immediate Care of the Newborn Once the infant is born, place him or her under the radi-ant warmer, dry him or her, assess him or her, wrap himor her in warmed blankets, and place him or her on thewoman's abdomen for warmth and closeness. In somehealth care facilities, the newborn is placed on the woman'sabdomen immediately after birth and covered with awarmed blanket. In either scenario, the stability of theCHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 395 newborn dictates the location of aftercare. The nurse can also assist the mother with breastfeeding her newbornfor the first time. Assessment of the newborn begins at the moment of birth and continues until the newborn is discharged.Drying the newborn and providing warmth to preventheat loss by evaporation is essential to help support thermo-regulation and provide stimulation. Placing the newbornunder a radiant heat source and putting on a stockinetcap will further reduce heat loss after drying. Assess the newborn by assigning an Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes. The Apgar score assesses ve parameters\u2014 heart rate (absent, slow, or fast), respiratory effort (absent,weak cry, or good strong yell), muscle tone (limp, or livelyand active), response to irritation stimulus, and color\u2014that evaluate a newborn's cardiorespiratory adaptationafter birth. The parameters are arranged from the mostimportant (heart rate) to the least important (color). Thenewborn is assigned a score of 0 to 2 in each of the veparameters. The purpose of the Apgar assessment is toevaluate the physiologic status of the newborn; see Chap-ter 18 for additional information on Apgar scoring. Secure two identication bands on the newborn's wrist and ankle that match the band on the mother's wristto ensure the newborn's identity. This identificationprocess is completed in the birthing suite before anyone leaves the room. Some health care agencies also take anearly photo of the newborn for identication in the eventof abduction (Healthcare Risk Management, 2007). Other types of newborn security systems can also be used to prevent abduction. Some systems have sensorsthat are attached to the newborn's identication braceletor cord clamp. An alarm is set off if the bracelet or clampactivates receivers near exits. Others have an alarm that isactivated when the sensor is removed from the newborn(Fig. 14.17). Even with the use of electronic sensors, theparents, nursing staff, and security personnel are respon-sible for prevention strategies and ensuring the safety andprotection of all newborns (Healthcare Risk Manage-ment, 2007). Sheila gave birth to a healthy 7-pound, 7-ounce baby girl. She is eager to hold and nurse her newborn. What is the initial care of the newborn? How can the nurse meet theneeds of both the newborn and Sheila, who is exhausted buteager to bond with her newborn? Nursing Management During the Third Stage of Labor During the third stage of labor, strong uterine contractions continue at regular intervals under the continuing influenceof oxytocin. The uterine muscle bers shorten, or retract,with each contraction, leading to a gradual decrease in the FIGURE14.16 Suctioning the newborn immediately after birth.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 395size of the uterus, which helps shear the placenta away from its attachment site. The third stage is complete when theplacenta is delivered. Nursing care during the third stage oflabor primarily focuses on immediate newborn care andassessment and being available to assist with the delivery ofthe placenta and inspecting it for intactness. Three hormones play important roles in the third stage. During this stage the woman experiences peak levelsof oxytocin and endorphins, while the high adrenalinelevels that occurred during the second stage of labor toaid with pushing begin falling. The hormone oxytocincauses uterine contractions and helps the woman to enactinstinctive mothering behaviors such as holding the new-born close to her body and cuddling the baby. Skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth and the newborn's rst attempt at breastfeeding further aug ment maternal oxytocin levels, strengthening the uterine con- tractions that will help the placenta to separate and theuterus to contract to prevent hemorrhage. Endorphins,396 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH Assessment Assessment during the third stage of labor includes: Monitoring placental separation by looking for the following signs: Firmly contracting uterus Change in uterine shape from discoid to globular ovoid Sudden gush of dark blood from vaginal opening Lengthening of umbilical cord protruding from vagina Examining placenta and fetal membranes for intactness the second time (the health care provider assesses theplacenta for intactness the rst time) (Fig. 14.18) Assessing for any perineal trauma, such as the following, before allowing the birth attendant to leave: Firm fundus with bright-red blood dark blood and clots: retained placenta FIGURE14.17 An example of a security sensor applied to a newborn's arm. A crucial role for nurses during this time is to protect the natural hormonal process by ensuring unhurried and uninterrupted contact betweenmother and newborn after birth, providing warmedblankets to prevent shivering, and allowing skin-to-skincontact and breastfeeding.Take NOTE! FIGURE14.18 Placenta. ( side. A Bthe body's natural opiates, produce an altered state of consciousness and aid in blocking out pain. In addition,the drop in adrenaline level from the second stage, whichhad kept the mother and baby alert at first contact,causes most women to shiver and feel cold shortly aftergiving birth.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 396 Inspecting the perineum for condition of episiotomy, if performed Assessing for perineal lacerations and ensuring repair by birth attendant Nursing Interventions Interventions during the third stage of labor include: Describing the process of placental separation to the couple Instructing the woman to push when signs of separation are apparent Administering an oxytocic if ordered and indicated after placental expulsion Providing support and information about episiotomy and/or laceration Cleaning and assisting client into a comfortable position after birth, making sure to lift both legs out of stirrups(if used) simultaneously to prevent strain Repositioning the birthing bed to serve as a recovery bed if applicable Assisting with transfer to the recovery area if applicable Providing warmth by replacing warmed blankets over the woman Applying an ice pack to the perineal area to provide comfort to episiotomy if indicated Explaining what assessments will be carried out over the next hour and offering positive reinforcement foractions Ascertaining any needs Monitoring maternal physical status by assessing: Vaginal bleeding: amount, consistency, and color Vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and respirations taken every 15 minutes Uterine fundus, which should be rm, in the midline, and at the level of the umbilicus Recording all birthing statistics and securing primary caregiver's signature Documenting birthing event in the birth book (ofcial record of the facility that outlines every birth event),detailing any deviations Nursing Management During the Fourth Stage of Labor The fourth stage of labor begins after the placenta is expelled and lasts up to 4 hours after birth, during whichtime recovery takes place. This recovery period may takeplace in the same room where the woman gave birth, in aseparate recovery area, or in her postpartum room. Duringthis stage, the woman's body is beginning to undergo themany physiologic and psychological changes that occurafter birth. The focus of nursing management during thefourth stage of labor involves frequent close observationfor hemorrhage, provision of comfort measures, and pro-motion of family attachment.CHAPTER 14 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING LABOR AND BIRTH 397 Assessment Assessments during the fourth stage center on the woman's vital signs, status of the uterine fundus and perineal area,comfort level, lochia amount, and bladder status. Duringthe rst hour after birth, vital signs are taken every 15 min-utes, then every 30 minutes for the next hour if needed. The woman's blood pressure should remain stable andwithin normal range after giving birth. A decrease mayindicate uterine hemorrhage; an elevation might suggestpreeclampsia. The pulse usually is typically slower (60 to 70 bpm) than during labor. This may be associated with a decreasein blood volume following placental separation. An ele-vated pulse rate may be an early sign of blood loss. Theblood pressure usually returns to its prepregnancy leveland therefore is not a reliable early indicator of shock.Fever is indicative of dehydration (less than 100.4 \u00b0F or 38\u00b0C) or infection (above 101 \u00b0F), which may involve the genitourinary tract. Respiratory rate is usually between16 and 24 breaths per minute and regular. Respirationsshould be unlabored unless there is an underlying pre-existing respiratory condition. Assess fundal height, position, and firmness every 15 minutes during the rst hour following birth. The fun-dus needs to remain rm to prevent excessive postpartumbleeding. The fundus should be rm (feels like the size andconsistency of a grapefruit), located in the midline andbelow the umbilicus. If it is not rm (boggy), gently mas-sage it until it is rm (see Nursing Procedure 22.1 for moreinformation). Once rmness is obtained, stop massaging. If the fundus is displaced to the right of the midline, suspect a full bladder as the cause.Take NOTE! The vagina and perineal areas are quite stretched and edematous following a vaginal birth. Assess the perineum,including the episiotomy if present, for possible hematomaformation. Suspect a hematoma if the woman reportsexcruciating pain or cannot void or if a mass is noted inthe perineal area. Also assess for hemorrhoids, which cancause discomfort. Assess the woman's comfort level frequently to deter- mine the need for analgesia. Ask the woman to rate herpain on a scale of 1 to 10; it should be less than 3. If it ishigher, further evaluation is needed to make sure therearen't any deviations contributing to her discomfort. Assess vaginal discharge (lochia) every 15 minutes for the rst hour and every 30 minutes for the next hour.Palpate the fundus at the same time to ascertain its rm-ness and help to estimate the amount of vaginal discharge.In addition, palpate the bladder for fullness, since many11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 397women receiving an epidural block experience limited sensation in the bladder region. Voiding should producelarge amounts of urine (diuresis) each time. Palpation ofthe woman's bladder after each voiding helps to ensurecomplete emptying. A full bladder will displace the uterusto either side of the midline and potentiate uterine hem-orrhage secondary to bogginess. Nursing Interventions Nursing interventions during the fourth stage might include: Providing support and information to the woman regarding episiotomy repair and related pain-relief andself-care measures Applying an ice pack to the perineum to promote comfort and reduce swelling Assisting with hygiene and perineal care; teaching the woman how to use the perineal bottle after each padchange and voiding; helping the woman into a new gown Monitoring for return of sensation and ability to void (if regional anesthesia was used) Encouraging the woman to void by ambulating to bathroom, listening to running water, or pouringwarm water over the perineal area with the peribottle Monitoring vital signs and fundal and lochia status every 15 minutes and documenting them Promoting comfort by offering analgesia for afterpains and warm blankets to reduce chilling Offering fluids and nourishment if desired Encouraging parent-infant attachment by providing privacy for the family Being knowledgeable about and sensitive to typical cultural practices after birth Assisting the mother to nurse, if she chooses, during the recovery period to promote uterine rmness (therelease of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary glandstimulates uterine contractions) Teaching the woman how to assess her fundus for rmness periodically and to massage it if it is boggy Describing the lochia flow and normal parameters to observe for postpartum Teaching safety techniques to prevent newborn abduction Demonstrating the use of the portable sitz bath as a comfort measure for her perineum if she had a laceration or an episiotomy repair Explain comfort/hygiene measures and when to use them Assisting with ambulation when getting out of bed for the rst time Providing information about the routine on the mother-baby unit or nursery for her stay Observing for signs of early parent-infant attachment: ngertip touch to palm touch to enfolding of the infant (Leonard, 2007)398 UNIT FOUR LABOR AND BIRTH /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546A nurse provides physical and emotional support during the labor and birth process to assist a woman to achieveher goals. /H18546When a woman is admitted to the labor and birth area, the admitting nurse must assess and evaluate the riskstatus of the pregnancy and initiate appropriate inter-ventions to provide optimal care for the client. /H18546Completing an admission assessment includes taking a maternal health history; performing physical assess-ment on the woman and fetus, including her emotionaland psychosocial status; and obtaining the necessarylaboratory studies. /H18546The nurse's role in fetal assessment for labor and birth includes determining fetal well-being and interpretingsigns and symptoms of possible compromise. Determin-ing the fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern and assessingamniotic fluid characteristics are key. /H18546FHR can be assessed intermittently or continuously. Although the intermittent method allows the client tomove about during labor, the information obtainedintermittently does not provide a complete picture offetal well-being from moment to moment. /H18546Assessment parameters of the FHR are classied as baseline rate, baseline variability (long-term and short-term), and periodic changes in the rate (accelerationsand decelerations). /H18546The nurse monitoring the laboring client needs to be knowledgeable about which parameters are reassuring,nonreassuring, and ominous so that appropriate inter-ventions can be instituted. /H18546For a nonreassuring FHR pattern, the nurse should notify the health care provider about the pattern andobtain further orders, making sure to document allinterventions and their effects on the FHR pattern. /H18546In addition to interpreting assessment ndings and ini- tiating appropriate inventions for the laboring client,accurate and timely documentation must be carriedout continuously. /H18546Today's women have many safe nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic choices for the management of painduring childbirth. They may be used individually or incombination to complement one another. /H18546Nursing management for the woman during labor and birth includes comfort measures, emotional support,information and instruction, advocacy, and support forthe partner. /H18546Nursing care during the first stage of labor includes taking an admission history (reviewing the prenatalrecord), checking the results of routine laboratory workand special tests done during pregnancy, asking thewoman about her childbirth preparation (birth plan,classes taken, coping skills), and completing a physicalassessment of the woman to establish a baseline ofvalues for future comparison.11223-14_CH14.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 398/H18546Nursing care during the second stage of labor focuses on supporting the woman and her partner in makingdecisions about her care and labor management, imple-menting strategies to prolong the early passive phaseof fetal descent, supporting involuntary bearing-downefforts, providing instruction and assistance, and encour-aging the use of maternal positions that can enhancedescent and reduce the pain. /H18546Nursing care during the third stage of labor primarily focuses on immediate newborn care and assessmentand being available to assist with the delivery of theplacenta and inspecting it for intactness. /H18546The focus of nursing management during the fourth stage of labor involves frequently observing the motherfor hemorrhage, providing comfort measures, and pro-moting family attachment.

She states she wants an \"all-natural\" birth withoutmedication. Her partner is with her and appears anxious but supportive. On the admission assess-ment, Carrie's prenatal history is unremarkable; vital signs are within normal limits; FHR via Doppler ranges between 140 and 144 bpm and is regular. a.Based on your assessment data and the woman'srequest not to have medication, what nonpharma-cologic interventions could you offer her? b.What positions might be suggested to facilitatefetal descent? 2.Several hours later, Carrie complains of nausea andturns to her partner and angrily tells him to not touchher and to go away. a.What assessment needs to be done to determinewhat is happening? b.What explanation can you offer Carrie's partnerregarding behavior? STUDYACTIVITIES 1.Share experiences within a post-clinical conferencegroup regarding the pain management interventionsof the patients to which you were assigned. Compareand evaluate the effectiveness of different methodsused, maternal behavior observed, and neonatal out-come in terms of Apgar scores. 2.On the fetal heart monitor, the nurse notices an ele-vation of the fetal baseline with the onset of contrac-tions.

The puerperium period begins after the delivery of the placenta and lasts approximately6 weeks. During this period the woman's body begins toreturn to its prepregnant state, and these changes gener-ally resolve by the sixth week after giving birth. However,the postpartum period can also be dened to include thechanges in all aspects of the mother's life that occur dur-ing the rst year after a child is born. Some believe that thepostpartum adjustment period lasts well into the rst year,making the fourth phase of labor the longest. Keeping thisin mind, the true postpartum period may last between 9and 12 months as the mother works to lose the weightshe gained while pregnant, adjusts psychologically to thechanges in her life, and takes on the new role of mother. This chapter describes the major physiologic and psychological changes that occur in a woman after child- birth. Various systemic adaptations take place through- out the woman's body. In addition, the mother and thefamily adjust to the new addition psychologically. Thebirth of a child changes the family structure and the rolesof the family members. The adaptations are dynamicand continue to evolve as physical changes occur and newroles emerge. Maternal Physiologic Adaptations During pregnancy, the woman's entire body changed to accommodate the needs of the growing fetus. Afterbirth, the woman's body once again undergoes signifi- cant changes in all body systems to return her body to its prepregnant state. Reproductive System Adaptations The reproductive system goes through tremendous adap-tations to return to the prepregnancy state. All organs andtissues of the reproductive system are involved. The femalereproductive system is unique in its capacity to remodelthroughout the woman's reproductive life. The events afterbirth, with the shedding of the placenta and subsequentuterine involution, involve substantial tissue destructionand subsequent repair and remodeling. For example, thewoman's menstrual cycle, interrupted during pregnancy,will begin to return several weeks after childbirth. Theuterus, which has undergone tremendous expansion dur-ing pregnancy to accommodate progressive fetal growth,will return to its prepregnant size over several weeks. Themother's breasts have grown to prepare for lactation anddo not return to their prepregnant size as the uterus does. Uterus The uterus returns to its normal size through a gradual pro-cess of involution , which involves retrogressive changes406 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD that return it to its nonpregnant size and condition. Invo- lution involves three retrogressive processes: 1. Contraction of muscle bers to reduce those previously stretched during pregnancy 2. Catabolism, which reduces enlarged, individual myometrial cells 3. Regeneration of uterine epithelium from the lower layer of the decidua after the upper layers have beensloughed off and shed during lochial discharge(Blackburn, 2007) The uterus, which weighs approximately 1,000 g (2.2 lb) soon after birth, undergoes physiologic involu-tion as it returns to its nonpregnant state. Approximately1 week after birth, the uterus shrinks in size by 50% andweighs about 500 g (1 lb); at the end of 6 weeks, it weighsapproximately 60 g (2 oz), about the weight before thepregnancy (Arenson & Drake, 2007; Blackburn, 2007;Fig. 15.1). During the rst few days after birth, the uterustypically descends from the level of the umbilicus at a rateof 1 cm (1 ngerbreadth) per day. By 3 days, the funduslies 2 to 3 ngerbreadths below the umbilicus (or slightlyhigher in multiparous women). By the end of 10 days, thefundus usually cannot be palpated because it has de-scended into the true pelvis. If these retrogressive changes do not occur as a result of retained placental fragments or infection, subinvolu-tion results. Subinvolution is generally responsive to earlydiagnosis and treatment. Factors that facilitate uterineinvolution include complete expulsion of amniotic mem-branes and placenta at birth, a complication-free ambulation.T day 1 day 2 day 3 Postpartum day 4 Postpartum day 5 Postpartum day 6 Postpartum day 7 Postpartum day 8 Postpartum day 9 Umbilicus11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 406Factors that inhibit involution include a prolonged labor and difcult birth, incomplete expulsion of amniotic mem-branes and placenta, uterine infection, overdistention of uterine muscles (such as by multiple gestation, hydram- nios, or a large singleton fetus), a full bladder (which displaces the uterus and interferes with contractions),anesthesia (which relaxes uterine muscles), and closechildbirth spacing (frequent and repeated distention de-creases tone and causes muscular relaxation). Lochia Lochia is the vaginal discharge that occurs after birth. It results from involution, during which the supercial layerof the decidua after childbirth, lochia is bright redand consists mainly of blood, fibrinous products, decid-ual cells, and red and white blood cells. The lochia fromthe uterus is alkaline but becomes acidic as it passesthrough the vagina. It is roughly equal to the amount oc-curring during a heavy menstrual period. The averageamount of lochial discharge is 240 to 270 mL (8 to 9 oz)(Nash, 2007). Women who have had cesarean births tend to have less flow because the uterine debris is removed manuallyalong with delivery of the placenta. Lochia is present inmost women for at least 3 weeks after childbirth, but itpersists in some women for as long as 6 weeks. Lochia passes through mixture of mucus, tissue debris, and blood that occurs for the rst 3 to 4 daysafter birth. As uterine bleeding subsides, it becomespaler and more serous. Lochia serosa is the second stage. It is pinkish brown and is expelled 3 to 10 days postpartum. Lochia serosaprimarily contains leukocytes, decidual tissue, redblood cells, and serous fluid. Lochia alba is the nal stage. The discharge is creamy white or light brown and consists of leukocytes, decidualtissue, and reduced fluid content. It occurs from days10 to 14 but can last 3 to 6 weeks postpartum in somewomen and still be considered normal. Lochia at any stage should have a fleshy smell; an offensive odor usually indicates an infection, such asendometritis.CHAPTER 15 POSTPARTUM ADAPTATIONS 407 Afterpains Part of the involution process involves uterine contrac-tions. Subsequently, many women are frequently both-ered by painful uterine contractions termed afterpains.All women experience afterpains, but they are more acutein multiparous women secondary to repeated stretchingof the uterine muscles. This repeated stretching reducesmuscle tone, allowing for alternate uterine contractionand relaxation. The uterus of a primiparous woman tendsto remain contracted after giving birth unless she isbreastfeeding; had a prolonged, difficult labor and birth;or had an overdistended uterus secondary to multiplegestation, hydramnios, or retained blood clots or placen-tal fragments. A danger sign is the reappearance of bright-red blood after lochia rubra has stopped. Reevaluation by the health care professionalis essential if this occurs.Take NOTE! Afterpains are usually stronger during breastfeeding because oxytocin released by the sucking reflex strengthens the contractions. Mildanalgesics can reduce this discomfort.Take NOTE! Cervix The cervix typically returns to its prepregnant state by week 6 of the postpartum period. The cervix gradually closes butnever regains its prepregnant appearance. Immediatelyafter childbirth, the cervix is shapeless and edematous andis easily distensible for several days. The cervical os grad-ually closes and returns to normal by 2 weeks, whereas the external os widens and never appears the same afterchildbirth. The external cervical os is no longer shaped likea circle, but instead appears as a jagged slit-like opening,often described as a \"sh mouth\" (Fig. 15.2). Vagina Shortly after birth, the vaginal mucosa is edematous andthin, with few rugae. As ovarian function returns and estro-gen production resumes, the mucosa thickens and rugae return in approximately 3 weeks. The vagina gapes at the FIGURE15.2 Appearance of the cervical os. ( A) Before the rst pregnancy. ( B) After pregnancy. AB11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 407opening and is generally lax. The vagina returns to its ap- proximate prepregnant size by 6 to 8 weeks postpartumbut will always remain a bit larger than it had been beforepregnancy. Normal mucus production and thickening of the vaginal mucosa usually return with ovulation (Edmonds,2007). Ovulation can return as early as a month afterchildbirth in women who are not breastfeeding, with amean time frame of 3 months. The mean time to ovula-tion in breastfeeding women is approximately 6 months,but this can vary greatly depending on breast-feeding pat-terns (Walsh, 2007). Localized dryness and coital dis-comfort (dyspareunia) usually plague most women untilmenstruation returns. Water-soluble lubricants can re-duce discomfort during intercourse. Box 15.1 lists somecommonly available water-soluble lubricants. Perineum The perineum is often edematous and bruised for the rstday or two after birth. If the birth involved an episiotomyor laceration, complete healing may take as long as 4 to6 months in the absence of complications at the site, suchas hematoma or infection (Blackburn, 2007). Perineal lac-erations may extend into the anus and cause considerablediscomfort for the mother when she is attempting to defe-cate or ambulate. The presence of swollen hemorrhoidsmay also heighten discomfort. Local comfort measuressuch as ice packs, pouring warm water over the area via aperibottle, witch hazel pads, anesthetic sprays, and sitzbaths can relieve pain. See Evidence-Based Practice 15.1. Supportive tissues of the pelvic floor are stretched during the childbirth process, and restoring their tonemay take up to 6 months. Pelvic relaxation can occur inany woman experiencing a vaginal birth. Nurses should408 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD encourage all women to practice Kegel exercises to im- prove pelvic floor tone, strengthen the perineal muscles,and promote healing.

Cardiovascular System Adaptations The cardiovascular system undergoes dramatic changes after birth. During pregnancy, the heart is displaced slightlyupward and to the left. This reverses as the uterus under-goes involution. Cardiac output remains high for the rstfew days postpartum and then gradually declines to non-pregnant values within 3 months of birth. Blood volume, which increased substantially during pregnancy, drops rapidly after birth and returns to normalwithin 4 weeks postpartum (Arenson & Drake, 2007).The decrease in both cardiac output and blood volumereflects the birth-related blood loss (an average of 500 mLwith a vaginal birth and 1,000 mL with a cesarean birth).Blood plasma volume is further reduced through diuresis,which occurs during the early postpartum period (Cheng& Caughey, 2007). Despite the decrease in blood volume,the hematocrit level remains relatively stable and mayeven increase, reflecting the predominant loss of plasma.Thus, an acute decrease in hematocrit is not an expectednding and may indicate hemorrhage. Pulse and Blood Pressure The increase in cardiac output during pregnancy begins todiminish after birth. This decrease in cardiac output is re-flected in bradycardia (50 to 70 bpm) for the rst 2 weekspostpartum. This slowing of the heart rate is related tothe increased blood that flows back to the heart and to thecentral circulation after it is no longer perfusing the pla-centa. This increase in central circulation brings about anincreased stroke volume and allows a slower heart rate toprovide ample maternal circulation. Gradually, cardiacoutput returns to prepregnant levels by 3 months afterchildbirth (Blackburn, 2007). Tachycardia (heart rate above 100 bpm) in the post- partum woman warrants further investigation. It may indi-cate hypovolemia, dehydration, or hemorrhage. However, because of the increased blood volume during pregnancy,a considerable loss may be well tolerated and not cause acompensatory cardiovascular response such as tachycardia.In most instances of postpartum hemorrhage, blood pres-sure and cardiac output remain increased because of the compensatory increase in heart rate. Thus, a decrease11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 408in blood pressure and cardiac output are not expected changes during the postpartum period. Early identica-tion is essential to ensure prompt intervention. Blood pressure values should be similar to those ob- tained during the labor process. In some women theremay be a slight transient increase lasting for about a weekafter childbirth (Edmonds, 2007). A signicant increaseaccompanied by headache might indicate preeclampsiaand requires further investigation. A decreased bloodpressure may suggest orthostatic hypotension or uterine hemorrhage. Coagulation Clotting factors that increased during pregnancy tend to remain elevated during the early postpartum period.Giving birth stimulates this hypercoagulability state further.As a result, these coagulation factors remain elevated for2 to 3 weeks postpartum (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau,2007). This hypercoagulable state, combined with vesseldamage during birth and immobility, places the womanat risk for thromboembolism (blood clots) in the lowerextremities and the lungs. Blood Cellular Components Red blood cell production ceases early in the puerperium,causing mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to de-crease slightly in the rst 24 hours. Over the next 2 weeks,both levels rise slowly. The white blood count, whichincreases in labor, remains elevated for first 4 to 6 daysafter birth but then falls to 6,000 to 10,000/mm 3. This white blood cell elevation can complicate a diagnosis ofinfection in the immediate postpartum period.CHAPTER 15 POSTPARTUM ADAPTATIONS 409 Urinary System Adaptations Pregnancy and birth can have profound effects on the uri- nary system. During pregnancy, the glomerular ltrationrate and renal plasma flow increase signicantly. Bothusually return to normal by 6 weeks after birth. Many women have difculty feeling the sensation to void after giving birth if they received an anesthetic blockduring labor (which inhibits neural functioning of thebladder) or if they received oxytocin to induce or augmenttheir labor (antidiuretic effect). These women will be atrisk for incomplete emptying, bladder distention, difcultyvoiding, and urinary retention. In addition, urination maybe impeded by: Perineal lacerations Generalized swelling and bruising of the perineum and tissues surrounding the urinary meatus Hematomas Decreased bladder tone as a result of regional anesthesia Diminished sensation of bladder pressure as a result of swelling, poor bladder tone, and numbing effects ofregional anesthesia used during labor (Nash, 2007) Difculty voiding can lead to urinary retention, blad- der distention, and ultimately urinary tract infection (UTI).Urinary retention and bladder distention can cause dis- placement of the uterus from the midline to the right andcan inhibit the uterus from contracting properly, whichincreases the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Urinary re-tention is a major cause of uterine atony , which allows ex- cessive bleeding. Frequent voiding of small amounts (less than 150 mL) suggests urinary retention with overflow,Hedayati, H., Parsons, J., & Crowther, C. A. (2003). Rectal analgesia for pain from perineal trauma following childbirth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2003, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD003931. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003931.Study Perineal pain from a tear and/or surgical cut (episiotomy) is a common problem following vaginal birth. Strategies toreduce perineal trauma and the appropriate repair of anyperineal damage sustained are important for avoiding andalleviating pain. Numerous pain-relief treatments are usedin clinical practice, such as local anesthetics, oral anal gesics, therapeutic ultrasound, antiseptics, and nonpharmacologicapplications such as ice packs and baths. This review assesses the evidence for using rectal analgesia for painrelief following perineal trauma caused by childbirth.Findings This review of trials found that NSAID rectal suppositoriesare associated with less pain up to 24 hours after birth,and less additional analgesia is required. More research isrequired to assess the longer-term outcomes, maternalsatisfaction, and effects, if any, on breast milk, mother-baby bonding, and sexual functioning. Nursing Implications According to the study, NSAID rectal suppositories werehelpful in relieving postpartum pain. Nurses can offer thisintervention to their patients and explain the evidence- based practice behind it. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 15.1 Rectal Analgesia for Pain From Perineal Trauma Following Childbirth11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 409and catheterization may be necessary to empty the blad- der to restore tone. Postpartum diuresis occurs as a result of several mech- anisms: the large amounts of intravenous fluids given during labor, a decreasing antidiuretic effect of oxytocinas its level declines, the buildup and retention of extrafluids during pregnancy, and a decreasing production ofaldosterone\u2014the hormone that decreases sodium reten- tion and increases urine production (Blackburn, 2007).All these factors contribute to rapid lling of the bladderwithin 12 hours of birth. Diuresis begins within 12 hoursafter childbirth and continues throughout the rst weekpostpartum. Normal function returns within a monthafter birth (Edmonds, 2007). 410 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD and diminished muscle tone. In addition, women with an episiotomy, perineal laceration, or hemorrhoids mayfear pain or damage to the perineum with their rst bowelmovement and may attempt to delay it. Subsequently, con- stipation is a common problem during the postpartum period. A stool softener can be prescribed for this reason. Most women are hungry and thirsty after childbirth, commonly related to NPO restrictions and the energyexpended during labor. Their appetite returns to nor-mal immediately after giving birth. Consider THIS! Have you ever felt like a real idiot by not being able to complete a simple task in life? I had a beautiful babyboy after only 6 hours of labor. My epidural workedwell and I actually felt very little discomfort throughoutmy labor. Because it was in the middle of the nightwhen they brought me to my postpartum room, I felt afew hours of sleep would be all I needed to be back tonormal. During an assessment early the next morning,the nurse found my uterus had shifted to the right frommy midline, and I was instructed to empty my bladder.I didn't understand why the nurse was concernedabout where my uterus was located and, besides, I didn'tfeel any sensation of a full bladder. But I did get upanyway and tried to comply. Despite all the nurse'stricks of running the faucet for sound effects, in addition to having warm water poured over my thighs via theperi-bottle, I was unable to urinate. How could I notaccomplish one of life's simplest tasks? Thoughts: Women who receive regional anesthesia frequently experience reduced sensation to their perinealarea and do not feel a full bladder. The nursing assess-ment revealed a displaced uterus secondary to a fullbladder. What additional \"tricks\" can be used to assistthis woman to void? What explanation should be offeredto her regarding why she is having difculty urinating? Anticipate the woman's need to replenish her body with food and fluids, and provide both soon after she gives birth.Take NOTE! If rectus muscle tone is not regained through exercise, support may not be adequate during future pregnancies.Take NOTE! Gastrointestinal System Adaptations The GI system quickly returns to normal because the gravid uterus is no longer lling the abdominal cavity andproducing pressure on the abdominal organs. Progesteronelevels, which caused relaxation of smooth muscle duringpregnancy and diminished bowel tone, also are declining. Regardless of the type of delivery, most women ex- perience decreased bowel tone and sluggish bowels forseveral days after birth. Decreased peristalsis occurs inresponse to analgesics, surgery, diminished intraabdom-inal pressure, low-ber diet and insufcient fluid intake,Musculoskeletal System Adaptations The effects of pregnancy on the muscles and joints varywidely. During pregnancy, the hormones relaxin, estrogen,and progesterone relax the joints. After birth, levels of thesehormones decline, resulting in a return of all joints to theirprepregnant state, with the exception of the woman's feet.Parous women will note a permanent increase in their shoesize (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Woman commonly experience fatigue and activity in- tolerance and have a distorted body image for weeks afterbirth secondary to declining relaxin and progesterone lev-els, which cause hip and joint pain that interferes with am-bulation and exercise. Good body mechanics and correctposition are important during this time to prevent low backpain and injury to the joints. Within 6 to 8 weeks after de-livery, joints are completely stabilized and return to normal. During pregnancy, stretching of the abdominal wall muscles occurs to accommodate the enlarging uterus.This stretching leads to a loss in muscle tone and possiblyseparation of the longitudinal muscles (rectus abdominismuscles) of the abdomen. Separation of the rectus abdo-minis muscles, called diastasis recti, is more common inwomen who have poor abdominal muscle tone beforepregnancy. After birth, muscle tone is diminished and theabdominal muscles are soft and flabby. Specic exercisesare necessary to help the woman regain muscle tone. For-tunately, diastasis responds well to exercise, and abdomi-nal muscle tone can be improved (see Chapter 16 for moreinformation about exercises to improve muscle tone).11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 410CHAPTER 15 POSTPARTUM ADAPTATIONS 411 after birth. For the breastfeeding woman, estrogen levels remain low until breastfeeding frequency decreases. Other placental hormones (hCG, hPL, progesterone) decline rapidly after birth. hCG levels are nonexistentat the end of the first postpartum week and hPL is undetectable within 1 day after birth (Blackburn, 2007).Progesterone levels are undetectable by 3 days afterchildbirth, and production is reestablished with the firstmenses. Prolactin levels decline within 2 weeks for thewoman who is not breastfeeding and remain elevated forthe lactating woman (Blackburn, 2007). Think back to Betsy, the woman experiencing painful changes in her breasts. What is Betsy describing to thelactation consultant? Why has the condition of her breastschanged compared to when she was in the hospital? Lactation Lactation is the secretion of milk by the breasts. It is thought to be brought about by the interaction of pro-gesterone, estrogen, prolactin, and oxytocin. Breast milktypically appears 3 days after childbirth. During pregnancy, the breasts increase in size and functional ability in preparation for breastfeeding. Withinthe rst month of gestation, the ducts of the mammaryglands grow branches, forming more lobules and alveoli.These structural changes make the breasts larger, moretender, and heavy. Each breast gains nearly 1 lb in weightby term, the glandular cells ll with secretions, blood ves-sels increase in number, and there are increased amountsof connective tissue and fat cells (Blackburn, 2007). Prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland, secreted in increasing levels throughout pregnancy, triggers the syn-thesis and secretion of milk after the woman gives birth. During pregnancy, prolactin, estrogen, and progesteronecause synthesis and secretion of colostrum, which con-tains protein and carbohydrate but no milk fat. It is onlyafter birth takes place, when the high levels of estrogen andprogesterone are abruptly withdrawn, that prolactin is ableto stimulate the glandular cells to secrete milk instead ofcolostrum. This takes place within 2 to 3 days after givingbirth. Oxytocin acts so that milk can be ejected from thealveoli to the nipple. Therefore, sucking by the newbornwill release milk. Prolactin levels increase in response tonipple stimulation during feedings. Prolactin and oxytocin result in milk production if stimulated by sucking (Walsh,2007) (Fig. 15.3). If the stimulus (sucking) is not present,as with a woman who is not breastfeeding, breast en-gorgement and milk production will subside within 2 to3 days postpartum. Typically, during the rst 2 days after birth, the breasts are soft and nontender. The woman also may report atingling sensation in both breasts. After this time, breastchanges depend on whether the mother is breastfeedingor taking measures to prevent lactation.Integumentary System Adaptations Another system that experiences lasting effects of preg- nancy is the integumentary system. As estrogen and pro-gesterone levels decrease, the onthe abdomen (linea nigra), face (melasma), and nipplesgradually fades. Some women experience hair loss dur-ing pregnancy and the postpartum periods. Approxi-mately 90% of hairs are growing at any one time, with theother 10% entering a resting phase. Because of the highestrogen levels present during pregnancy, an increasednumber of hairs go into the resting phase, which is partof the normal hair loss cycle. The most common periodfor hair loss is within 3 months after birth, when estrogenreturns to normal levels and more hairs are allowed to fallout. This hair loss is temporary, and regrowth generallyreturns to normal levels in 6 to 12 months (Lyon, 2007). Striae gravidarum (stretch marks) that developed dur- ing pregnancy on the breasts, abdomen, and hips grad-ually fade to silvery lines. However, these lines do notdisappear completely. Although many products on themarket claim to make stretch marks disappear, their effectiveness is highly questionable. The profuse diaphoresis (sweating) that is common during the early postpartum period is one of the mostnoticeable adaptations in the integumentary system. Manywomen will wake up drenched with perspiration during thepuerperium. This postpartal diaphoresis is a mechanism toreduce the amount of fluids retained during pregnancy andrestore prepregnant body fluid levels. It can be profuseat times. It is common, especially at night during the rstweek after birth. Reassure the client that this is normal andencourage her to change her gown to prevent chilling. Respiratory System Adaptations Respirations usually remain within the normal adult rangeof 16 to 24 breaths per minute. As the abdominal organsresume their nonpregnant position, the diaphragm returnsto its usual position. Anatomic changes in the thoraciccavity and rib cage caused by increasing uterine growth resolve quickly. As a result, discomforts such as shortnessof breath and rib aches are relieved. Tidal volume, minutevolume, vital capacity, and functional residual capacityreturn to prepregnant values, typically within 1 to 3 weeks of birth (Blackburn, 2007). Endocrine System Adaptations The endocrine system undergoes several changes rapidlyafter birth. Levels of circulating estrogen and progesteronedrop quickly with delivery of the placenta. Decreasedestrogen levels are associated with breast engorgementand with the diuresis of excess extracellular fluid accumu-lated during pregnancy (Edmonds, 2007). Estrogen is at its lowest level a week after birth. For the woman who is notbreastfeeding, estrogen levels begin to increase by 2 weeks11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 411Engorgement is the process of swelling of the breast tissue as a result of an increase in blood and lymph supplyas a precursor to lactation (Bainbridge, 2007). Breastsincrease in vascularity and swell in response to prolactin2 to 4 days after birth. If engorged, the breasts will be hardand tender to touch. They are temporarily full, tender,and very uncomfortable until the milk supply is ready.Frequent emptying of the breasts helps to minimize dis-comfort and resolve engorgement. Standing in a warm shower or applying warm compresses immediately beforefeedings will help to soften the breasts and nipples in orderto allow the newborn to latch on easier. These measureswill also enhance the letdown reflex. Between feedings,applying cold compresses to the breasts helps to reduceswelling. To maintain milk supply, the breasts need to bestimulated by a nursing infant, a breast pump, or manualexpression of the milk (Fig. 15.4). Remember Betsy, with the breast discomfort? The lactation consultant explained that she was experiencingnormal breast engorgement and offered several suggestions to help her. What relief measures might they be? Whatreassurance can be given to Betsy at this time?412 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD If the woman is not breastfeeding, relief measures include wearing a tight, supportive bra 24 hours daily,applying ice to her breasts for approximately 15 to 20 min-utesevery other hour, and not stimulating the breasts by squeezing or manually expressing milk from the nip-ples. In addition, avoiding exposing the breasts to warmth(e.g., a hot shower) will help relieve breast engorgement.In women who are not breastfeeding, engorgement typi-cally subsides within 2 to 3 days with these measures. Ovulation and Return of Menstruation Changing hormone levels constantly interact with oneanother to produce bodily changes. Four major hor-mones are influential during the postpartum period: es-trogen, progesterone, prolactin, and oxytocin. Estrogenis the major female hormone during pregnancy, but lev-els drop profoundly at birth and reach their lowest levela week into the postpartum period. Progesterone quietsthe uterus to prevent a preterm birth during pregnancy,and its increasing levels during pregnancy prevent lacta-tion from starting before birth takes place. As with estro-gen, progesterone levels decrease dramatically after birthand are undetectable 72 hours after birth. Progesteronelevels are reestablished with the first menstrual cycle(Blackburn, 2007). During the postpartum period, oxytocin stimulates the uterus to contract during the breastfeeding sessionand for as long as 20 minutes after each feeding. Oxytocin also acts on the breast by eliciting the milk letdown reflexduring breastfeeding. Prolactin is also associated with thebreastfeeding process by stimulating milk production. Inwomen who breastfeed, prolactin levels remain elevatedFIGURE15.3 Physiology of lactation.FIGURE15.4 Mother using breast pumps to stimulate milk production. 11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 412into the sixth week after birth (Nash, 2007). The levels of the hormone increase and decrease in proportion to nip-ple stimulation. Prolactin levels decrease in nonlactatingwomen, reaching prepregnant levels by the third post-partum week (Edmonds, 2007). High levels of prolactinhave been found to delay ovulation by inhibiting ovarianresponse to FSH (Edmonds, 2007). The timing of rst menses and ovulation after birth differs between women who are and are not breastfeeding.For nonlactating women, menstruation usually resumes7 to 9 weeks after giving birth, with the first cycle beinganovulatory (Walsh, 2007). The return of menses in thelactating woman depends on breastfeeding frequencyand duration. It can return anytime from 2 to 18 monthsafter childbirth, depending on whether the woman isexclusively breastfeeding or supplementing with formula.The rst postpartum menstrual period may be heavier thanprepregnant ones and is anovulatory (Hackley,Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007).CHAPTER 15 POSTPARTUM ADAPTATIONS 413 experience changes related to the birth of the newborn. Chapter 16 describes these changes. Maternal Psychological Adaptations Postpartum depression affects the transition to the ma-ternal role for many mothers. Between 50% and 80%of new mothers suffer from the short-lived postpartummood disorder termed \"baby blues.\" In addition, eachyear in the United States, up to 28% of new mothers ormore than 400,000 new mothers suffer debilitating post-partum depression, a prevalence that continues unabated (AWHONN, 2007). Postpartum depression can lead toalienation from loved ones, daily dysfunction second-ary to overwhelming sorrow and disorientation, and, atits most extreme, personal terror resulting in dangerousthoughts and violent actions. For additional information,see Chapter 22. The woman experiences a variety of responses as she adjusts to a new family member, postpartum discomforts,changes in her body image, and the reality of change inher life. In the early 1960s, Reva Rubin identied threephases that a mother goes through to adjust to her newmaternal role. Rubin's maternal role framework can beused to monitor the client's progress as she \"tries on\"her new role as a mother. Absence of these processes orinability to progress through the phases satisfactorily mayimpede the appropriate development of the maternal role(Rubin, 1984). Although Rubin's maternal role develop-ment theories are of value, some of her observations re-garding the length of each phase may not be completelyrelevant for the contemporary woman of the 21st century. Today, many women know their infant's gender, have\"seen\" their fetus in utero through four-dimensional ul-trasound, and have a working knowledge of childbirthand child care. They are less passive than in years past andprogress through the phases of attaining the maternal roleat a much faster pace than Rubin would have imagined.Still, Rubin's framework is timeless for assessing and mon-itoring expected role behaviors when planning care and appropriate interventions. Taking-In Phase The taking-in phase is the time immediately after birth when the client needs sleep, depends on others to meet herneeds, and relives the events surrounding the birth process.This phase is characterized by dependent behavior. Dur-ing the rst 24 to 48 hours after giving birth, mothers oftenassume a very passive role in meeting their own basicneeds for food, fluids, and rest, allowing the nurse to makedecisions for them concerning activities and care. Theyspend time recounting their labor experience to anyonewho will listen. Such actions help the mother integrate thebirth experience into reality\u2014that is, the pregnancy is over and the newborn is now a unique individual, separate fromherself. When interacting with the newborn, new mothers Ovulation may occur before menstruation; therefore, breastfeeding is not a reliable method of contraception. Other methods of familyplanning must be used to control fertility (Alexander et al., 2007).Take NOTE! Betsy tries several of the measures the lactation consultant suggested to relieve her breast discomfort but is still havingheaviness and pain. She feels discouraged and tells the nurseshe is thinking of reducing her breastfeeding and usingformula to feed her newborn. Is that a good choice? Why or why not? What interventions will help Betsy get throughthis difcult time? Psychological Adaptations Mothers' and fathers' experiences of pregnancy are nec- essarily different, and this difference continues after child-birth as they both adjust to their new parenting roles.Parenting involves caring for infants physically and emo-tionally to foster the growth and development of responsi-ble, caring adults. During the early months of parenthood,mothers experience more life changes and get more sat-isfaction from their new roles than fathers. However,fathers interact with their newborns much like mothers(Thorpe, 2007). Early parent-infant contact after birthimproves attachment behaviors. Other members of thenewborn's family, such as siblings and grandparents, also11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 413spend time claiming the newborn and touching him or her, commonly identifying specic features in the new-born, such as \"he has my nose\" or \"his ngers are long like his father's\" (Fig. 15.5).414 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD FIGURE15.5 Mother bonding with newborn during the taking-in phase. FIGURE15.6 Engrossment of the father and his newborn. The taking-in phase typically lasts 1 to 2 days and may be the only phase observed by nurses in the hospital setting because of the short-ened postpartum stays that are the norm today.Take NOTE! Most research ndings stress the importance of early contact between the father or signicant other and the newborn, as well as partici-pation in infant care activities, to foster the relation-ship (Thorpe, 2007).Take NOTE! Taking-Hold Phase The taking-hold phase , the second phase of maternal adaptation, is characterized by dependent and inde-pendent maternal behavior. This phase typically startson the second to third day postpartum and may last sev-eral weeks. As the client regains control over her bodily func- tions during the next few days, she will be taking holdand becoming preoccupied with the present. She willbe particularly concerned about her health, the infant'scondition, and her ability to care for him or her. Shedemonstrates increased autonomy and mastery of her ownbody's functioning, and a desire to take charge with sup-port and help from others. She will show independenceby caring for herself and learning to care for her newborn,but she still requires assurance that she is doing well asa mother. She expresses a strong interest in caring forthe infant by herself. Letting-Go Phase In the letting-go phase , the third phase of maternal adaptation, the woman reestablishes relationships withother people. She adapts to parenthood through her new role as a mother. She assumes the responsibility and carefor the newborn with a bit more condence now (Arenson& Drake, 2007). The focus of this phase is to move forwardby assuming the parental role and to separate herself fromthe symbiotic relationship that she and her newborn hadduring pregnancy. She establishes a lifestyle that includesthe infant. The mother relinquishes the fantasy infant andaccepts the real one. Partner Psychological Adaptations For partners, whether they are husbands, significant others, boyfriends, same-sex life partners, or just friends, becoming a parent or just sharing the childbirth experi-ence can be a perplexing time as well as a time of greatchange. This transition is influenced by many factors,including participation in childbirth, relationships withsignicant others, competence in child care, the familyrole organization, the individual's cultural background,and the method of infant feeding. Infants have a powerful effect on their fathers and others, who become intensely involved with them (Fig. 15.6). The father's or signicant other's developing bond with the newborn\u2014a interest\u2014is 15 POSTPARTUM ADAPTATIONS 415 frustration. Many wish to be more involved in the new- born's care and yet do not feel prepared to do so. Somend parenting fun but at the same time do not feel fullyprepared to take on that role. Stage 3: Transition to Mastery In stage 3 (transition to mastery), the father or partnermakes a conscious decision to take control and be at thecenter of his newborn's life regardless of his preparedness.This adjustment period is similar to that of the mother'sletting-go phase, when she incorporates the newest mem-ber into the family. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546The puerperium period refers to the rst 6 weeks after delivery. During this period, the mother experiencesmany physiologic and psychological adaptations to re-turn her to the prepregnant state. /H18546Involution involves three processes: contraction of mus- cle bers to reduce stretched ones, catabolism (whichreduces enlarged, individual cells), and regeneration ofuterine epithelium from the lower layer of the deciduaafter the upper layers have been sloughed off and alba during the postpartal period. /H18546Maternal blood plasma volume decreases rapidly after birth and returns to normal within 4 weeks postpartum. /H18546Reva Rubin (1984) identied three phases the mother goes through to adjust to her new maternal role.

The three stages includeexpectations, reality, and transition to mastery. REFERENCES Alexander, L. L., LaRosa, J. H., Bader, H., & Gareld, S. (2007). New dimensions in women's health (4th ed.).

Visual awareness of the newborn\u2014the father or partner perceives the newborn as attractive, pretty,or beautiful 2. Tactile awareness of the newborn\u2014the father or partner has a desire to touch or hold the newbornand considers this activity to be pleasurable 3. Perception of the newborn as perfect\u2014the father or partner does not \"see\" any imperfections 4. Strong attraction to the newborn\u2014the father or partner focuses all attention on the newborn whenhe is in the room 5. Awareness of distinct features of the newborn\u2014the father or partner can distinguish his newborn fromothers in the nursery 6. Extreme elation\u2014the father or partner feels a \"high\" after the birth of his child 7. Increased sense of self-esteem\u2014the father or partner feels proud, \"bigger,\" more mature, and older afterthe birth of his child (Sears & Sears, 2006) Frequently, fathers or partners are portrayed as well- meaning but bumbling when caring for newborns. How- ever, they have their own unique way of relating to theirnewborns and can become as nurturing as mothers. Afather or partner's nurturing responses may be less auto-matic and slower to unfold than a mother's, but they arecapable of a strong bonding attachment to their newborns(Sears & Sears, 2006). Encouraging fathers or partners toexpress their feelings by seeing, touching, and holdingtheir son or daughter and by cuddling, talking to, and feed-ing him or her will help to cement this new relationship.Reinforcement of this engrossing behavior helps fathersor partners to make a positive attachment during this crit-ical period. Three-Stage Role Development Process Similar to mothers, fathers or partners also go througha predictable three-stage process during the first 3 weeksas they too \"try on\" their roles as parents. The threestages are expectations, reality, and transition to mastery (Sears & Sears, 2006). Stage 1: Expectations New fathers or partners pass through stage 1 (expecta-tions) with preconceptions about what home life will belike with a newborn. Many men may be unaware of thedramatic changes that can occur when this newborncomes home to live with them. For some, it is an eye-opening experience. Stage 2: Reality Stage 2 (reality) occurs when fathers or partners realize thattheir expectations in stage 1 are not realistic. Their feelingschange from elation to sadness, ambivalence, jealousy, and11223-15_UT5-CH15.qxd 8/4/08 2:57 PM Page 415Cheng, Y. W., & Caughey, A. B. (2007) Normal labor and delivery. eMedicine.

Remember the couple introduced at the beginning of the chapter? When the postpartum nurse comes to examineRaina, her husband quickly leaves the room and returns ashort time later after the examination is complete. How doyou interpret his behavior toward his wife? What might youcommunicate to this couple? This chapter describes the nursing management of the woman and her family during the postpartum period. Itoutlines physical assessment parameters for new mothersand newborns. It also focuses on bonding and attachmentbehaviors; nurses need to be aware of these behaviorsso they can perform appropriate interventions. Steps toaddress physiologic needs such as comfort, self-care, nu-trition, and contraception are described. Ways to help thewoman and her family adapt to the birth of the newbornare also discussed (Fig. 16.1). Nursing management during the postpartum period focuses on assessing the woman's ability to adapt to thephysiologic and psychological changes occurring at thistime (see Chap. 15 for a detailed discussion of theseadaptations). Family members are also assessed to deter- mine how well they are making the transition to this newstage. Based on assessment ndings, the nurse plans andimplements care to address the family's needs. Becauseof today's shortened lengths of stay, the nurse may be ableto focus only on priority needs and may need to arrangefor follow-up in the home to ensure that all the family'sneeds are met. Parenting is a skill that is often learned by trial and error, with varying degrees of success. Successful parenting, a continuous and complexinteractive process, requires the parents to learn newskills and to integrate the new member into the family.Take NOTE! Once the infant is born, each system in the mother's body takes several weeks to return to its nonpregnant state.The physiologic changes in women during the postpar-tum period are dramatic. Nurses should be aware of thesechanges and should be able to make observations and as- sessments to validate normal occurrences and detect anydeviations. In addition to physical assessment and care of the woman in the postpartum period, strong social supportis vital to help her integrate the baby into the family. Intoday's mobile society, extended families may live faraway and may be unable to help care for the new family.As a result, many new parents turn to health care pro-fessionals for information as well as physical and emo-tional support during this adjustment period. Nurses can be an invaluable resource by serving as mentors, teachingabout self-care measures and baby care basics, and pro-viding emotional support. Nurses can \"mother\" the newmother by offering physical care, emotional support, andinformation and practical help. The nurse's support andcare through this critical time can increase the new parents'condence, giving them a sense of accomplishment in theirparenting skills. One important intervention during the postpartum period is promotion of breast-feeding. Healthy People 2010 includes breast-feeding as a goal for maternal, infant, andchild health. As in all nursing care, nurses should provide culturally competent care during the postpartum period. The nurseshould engage in ongoing cultural self-assessment andovercome any stereotypes that perpetuate prejudice ordiscrimination against any cultural group (Bowers, 2007).Providing culturally competent nursing care during thepostpartum period requires time, open-mindedness, and patience. To promote positive outcomes, the nurse shouldIncrease the proportion of mothers who breast-feedtheir babies. Increase the number of mothers who breast-feed during earlypostpartum from a baseline of64% to 75%. Increase the number of mothers who breast-feed at 6 monthsfrom a baseline of 29% to 50%. Increase the number of mothers who breast-feed at 1 year froma baseline of 16% to 25%.Will provide infants with the most complete form of nutri-tion, improving their health,growth and development,and immunity Will improve maternal health via breast-feeding's benecialeffects Will increase the rate of breast-feeding, particularlyamong low-income racial and ethnicpopulations who are lesslikely to begin breast-feeding in the hospital or to sustain it through the infant's first yearHEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Objective Signicance11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 420Assessment Comprehensive nursing assessment begins within an hour after the woman gives birth and continues throughdischarge.CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 421 FIGURE16.1 Parents and grandmother interacting with the newborn. Nurses need a rm grasp of normal ndings so that they can recognize abnormal ndings and intervene appropriately.Take NOTE! This assessment includes vital signs and physical and psychosocial assessments. Although the exact protocolmay vary among facilities, postpartum assessment typi-cally is performed as follows: During the rst hour: every 15 minutes During the second hour: every 30 minutes During the rst 24 hours: every 4 hours After 24 hours: every 8 hours (Simpkin & James, 2006) During each assessment, keep in mind risk factors that may lead to complications, such as infection or hemor-rhage, during the recovery period (Box 16.1). Early iden-tication is critical to ensure prompt intervention. As with any assessment, always review the woman's medical record for information about her pregnancy, labor,and birth. Note any preexisting conditions, any complica-tions that occurred during pregnancy, labor, birth, and immediately afterward, and any treatments provided. Postpartum assessment of the mother typically in- cludes vital signs, pain level, and a systematic head-to-toereview of body systems. The acronym BUBBLE-EE\u2014breasts, uterus, bladder, bowels, lochia, episiotomy/perineum, extremities, and emotional status\u2014can be usedas a guide for this head-to-toe review (Blackburn, 2007).BOX 16.1 Factors Increasing the Woman's Risk for Postpartum Complications Risk Factors for Postpartum Infection Operative procedure (forceps, cesarean birth, vacuum extraction) History of diabetes, including gestational-onset diabetes Prolonged labor (more than 24 hours) Use of indwelling urinary catheter Anemia (hemoglobin less than 10.5 mg/dL) Multiple vaginal examinations during labor Prolonged rupture of membranes (more than 24 hours) Manual extraction of placenta Compromised immune system (HIV positive) Risk Factors for Postpartum Hemorrhage Precipitous labor (less than 3 hours) Uterine previa or abruptio placentae Labor induction or procedures (vacuum extraction, forceps, cesarean birth) Retained placental fragments Prolonged third stage of labor (more than 30 minutes) Multiparity, more than three births closely spaced Uterine overdistention (large infant, twins, hydramnios) BOX 16.2 Postpartum Danger Signs Fever more than 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) Foul-smelling lochia or an unexpected change in color or amount Visual changes, such as blurred vision or spots, or headaches Calf pain with dorsiflexion of the foot Swelling, redness, or discharge at the episiotomy site Dysuria, burning, or incomplete emptying of the bladder Shortness of breath or difculty breathing Depression or extreme mood swingsWhile assessing the woman and her family during the postpartum period, be alert for danger signs (Box 16.2).Notify the primary health care provider immediately if anyare noted. Postpartum assessment also includes assessing the parents and other family members, such as siblings andgrandparents, for attachment and bonding with thenewborn.11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 421Vital Signs Obtain vital signs and compare them with the previous values, noting and reporting any deviations. Vital signchanges can be an early indicator of complications. Temperature Use a consistent measurement technique (oral, axillary,or tympanic) to get the most accurate readings. Typically,the new mother's temperature during the rst 24 hourspostpartum is within the normal range. Some women ex-perience a slight fever, up to 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), during the rst 24 hours. This elevation may be the result of dehy-dration because of fluid loss during labor. Temperatureshould be normal after 24 hours with replacement of flu-ids lost during labor and birth (Arenson & Drake, 2007).A temperature above 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) at any time or an abnormal temperature after the rst 24 hours may indicateinfection and must be reported. Abnormal temperaturereadings warrant continued monitoring until an infectioncan be ruled out through cultures or blood studies. Pulse Because of the changes in blood volume and cardiac out-put after delivery, relative bradycardia may be noted. Thewoman's pulse rate may range from 50 to 70 bpm. Pulseusually stabilizes to prepregnancy levels within 10 days(Blackburn, 2007). Tachycardia in the postpartum woman can suggest anxiety, excitement, fatigue, pain, excessive blood loss,infection, or underlying cardiac problems. Further inves-tigation is warranted to rule out complications. Respirations Respiratory rates in the postpartum woman should bewithin the normal range of 16 to 20 breaths per minute.Any change in respiratory rate out of the normal rangemight indicate pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or pulmonaryembolism and must be reported. Lungs should be clear onauscultation. Blood Pressure Assess the woman's blood pressure and compare it withher usual range. Report any deviation from this range.Elevations in blood pressure from baseline might suggestpregnancy-induced hypertension; decreases may suggestdehydration or excessive blood loss. Blood pressure also may vary based on the woman's position, so assess blood pressure with the woman in thesame position every time. Be alert for orthostatic hypo-tension, which can occur when the woman moves rapidlyfrom a lying or sitting position to a standing one. Pain Pain, the fifth vital sign, is assessed along with the otherfour parameters. Question the woman about the type of422 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD pain and its location and severity. Have the woman rate the pain using a numeric scale from 0 to 10 points. Many postpartum orders will have the nurse pre- medicate the woman routinely for afterbirth pains ratherthan wait for her to experience them rst. The goal of painmanagement is to have the woman's pain scale ratingmaintained between 0 to 2 points at all times, especially after breast-feeding. This can be accomplished by assess-ing the woman's pain level frequently and preventing painby administering analgesics. If the woman has severe painin the perineal region despite use of physical comfort mea-sures, check for a hematoma by inspecting and palpatingthe area. If one is found, notify the health care providerimmediately. Breasts Inspect the breasts for size, contour, asymmetry, engorge-ment, or erythema. Check the nipples for cracks, redness,fissures, or bleeding, and note whether they are erect,flat, or inverted. Flat or inverted nipples can make breast-feeding challenging for both mother and infant. Cracked,blistered, fissured, bruised, or bleeding nipples in thebreast-feeding woman are generally indications that thebaby is improperly positioned on the breast. Palpate the breasts lightly to ascertain if they are soft, filling, orengorged, and document your ndings. For women whoare not breast-feeding, use a gentle, light touch to avoidbreast stimulation, which would exacerbate engorgement.As milk is starting to come in, the breasts become rmer;this is charted as \"lling.\" Engorged breasts are hard, ten-der, and taut. Ask the woman if she is having any nipplediscomfort. Palpate the breasts for any nodules, masses,or areas of warmth, which may indicate a plugged ductthat may progress to mastitis if not treated promptly. Any discharge from the nipple should be described and docu-mented if it is not colostrum (creamy yellow) or foremilk(bluish white). Uterus Assess the fundus (top portion of the uterus) to determinethe degree of uterine involution. If possible, have thewoman empty her bladder before assessing the fundus. Ifthe patient has had a cesarean birth and has a PCA pump,instruct her to self-medicate prior to fundal assessment todecrease her discomfort. Using a two-handed approachwith the woman in the supine position and the bed in a flatposition or as low as possible, palpate the abdomen gently,feeling for the top of the uterus while the other hand isplaced on the lower segment of the uterus to stabilize it(Fig. 16.2). The fundus should be midline and should feel rm. A boggy or relaxed uterus is a sign of uterine atony. Thiscan be the result of bladder distention, which displacesthe uterus upward and to the right, or retained placentalfragments. Either situation predisposes the woman tohemorrhage.11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 422Once the fundus is located, place your index nger on the fundus and count the number of ngerbreadthsbetween the fundus and the umbilicus (1 ngerbreadth isapproximately equal to 1 cm). One to 2 hours after birth,the fundus typically is between the umbilicus and thesymphysis pubis. Approximately 6 to 12 hours after birth,the fundus usually is at the level of the umbilicus. Normally, the fundus progresses downward at a rate of one ngerbreadth (or 1 cm) per day after childbirth(Cunningham et al., 2005). On the rst postpartum day,the top of the fundus is located 1 cm below the umbilicusand is recorded as U-1. Similarly, on the second postpar-tum day, the fundus would be 2 cm below the umbilicusand should be recorded as U-2, and so on. If the fundus isnot rm, gently massage the uterus using a circular motionuntil it becomes rm. Bladder Considerable diuresis\u2014as much as 3,000 mL\u2014may followfor several days after childbirth, decreasing by the third day(Blackburn, 2007). However, many postpartum womendo not sense the need to void even if their bladder is full.Women who received regional anesthesia during labor areat risk for bladder distention and for difficulty voidinguntil sensation returns within several hours after birth. Assess for voiding problems by asking the woman the following questions: Have you (passed your water, urinated, gone to the bathroom) yet? Have you noticed any burning or discomfort with urination?CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 423 Do you have any difculty passing your urine? Do you feel that your bladder is empty when you nish urinating? Do you have any signs of infection such as urgency, frequency, or pain? Are you able to control the flow of urine by squeezing your muscles? Have you noticed any leakage of urine when you cough, laugh, or sneeze? Assess the bladder for distention and adequate empty- ing after efforts to void. Palpate the area over the symphysispubis. If empty, the bladder is not palpable. Palpation of arounded mass suggests bladder distention. Also percussthe area: a full bladder is dull to percussion. If the bladderis full, lochia drainage will be more than normal becausethe uterus cannot contract to suppress the bleeding. FIGURE16.2 Palpating the fundus. Note the location and condition of the fundus; a full bladder tends to displace the uterus up and to the right.Take NOTE! After the woman voids, palpate and percuss the area again to determine adequate emptying of the blad-der. If the bladder remains distended, the woman maybe retaining urine in her bladder, and measures to ini-tiate voiding should be instituted. Be alert for signs ofinfection, including infrequent or insufficient voiding(less than 200 mL), discomfort, burning, urgency, orfoul-smelling urine (Simpkin & James, 2006). Documenturine output. Bowels Spontaneous bowel movements may not occur for 2 to3 days after giving birth because of a decrease in muscletone in the intestines during labor. Normal patterns ofbowel elimination usually return within 8 to 14 days afterbirth (Blackburn, 2007). Inspect the woman's abdomen for distention, auscul- tate for bowel sounds in all four quadrants, and palpate fortenderness. The abdomen typically is soft, nontender, andnondistended. Bowel sounds are present in all four quad-rants. Ask the woman if she has had a bowel movement orhas passed gas since giving birth, because constipation is acommon problem during the postpartum period and mostwomen do not offer this information unless asked about it.Normal assessment ndings are active bowel sounds, pass-ing gas, and a nondistended abdomen. Lochia Assess lochia in terms of amount, color, odor, and changewith activity and time. To assess how much a woman is11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 423bleeding, ask her how many perineal pads she has used in the past 1 to 2 hours and how much drainage was on eachpad. For example, did she saturate the pad completely,or was only half of the pad covered with drainage? Askabout the color of the drainage, odor, and the presence ofany clots. Lochia has a denite musky scent, with an odorsimilar to that of menstrual flow without any large clots.Foul-smelling lochia suggests an infection, and large clotssuggest poor uterine involution, necessitating additionalintervention. To determine the amount of lochia, observe the amount of lochia saturation on the perineal pad and re-late it to time (Fig. 16.3). Lochia flow will increase whenthe woman gets out of bed (lochia pools in the vagina andthe uterus while she is lying down) and when she breast-feeds (oxytocin release causes uterine contractions). Awoman who saturates a perineal pad within 30 to 60 min-utes is bleeding much more than one who saturates a padin 2 hours. Typically, the amount of lochia is describedas follows: Scant: a 1- to 2-inch lochia stain on the perineal pad or approximately a 10-mL loss Light or small: an approximately 4-inch stain or a 10- to 25-mL loss Moderate: a 4- to 6-inch stain with an estimated loss of 25 to 50 mL Large or heavy: a pad is saturated within 1 hour after changing it (Nash, 2007) The total volume of lochia is approximately 240 to 270 mL (8 to 9 oz), and the amount decreases daily(Blackburn, 2007). Check under the woman to make sure there isn't additional blood hidden and not absorbedon her perineal pad. Report any abnormal ndings, such as heavy, bright- red lochia with large tissue fragments or a foul odor. Ifexcessive bleeding occurs, the rst step would be to mas-424 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD sage the boggy fundus until it is rm to reduce the flow of blood. Document all ndings. Women who had a cesarean birth will have less lochia discharge than those who had a vaginal birth, but stagesand color changes remain the same. Although the woman'sabdomen will be tender after surgery, the nurse must pal-pate the fundus and assess the lochia to make sure theyare within the normal range and that there is no excessivebleeding. Anticipatory guidance to give the woman at dis- charge should include information about lochia and theexpected changes. Urge the woman to notify her healthcare provider if lochia rubra returns after the serosa andalba transitions have taken place. This is abnormal andmay indicate subinvolution or that the woman is too activeand needs to rest more. Lochia is an excellent mediumfor bacterial growth. Explain to the woman that frequentchanging of perineal pads, continued use of her peribottlefor rinsing her perineal area, and handwashing beforeand after pad changes are important infection controlmeasures. Episiotomy and Perineum To assess the episiotomy and perineal area, position thewoman on her side with her top leg flexed upward at theknee and drawn up toward her waist. If necessary, use apenlight to provide adequate lighting during the assess-ment. Wearing gloves and standing at the woman's side with her back to you, gently lift the upper buttock to exposethe perineum and anus (Fig. 16.4). Inspect the episiotomyfor irritation, ecchymosis, tenderness, or hematomas.Assess for hemorrhoids and their condition. During the early postpartum period, the perineal tissue surrounding the episiotomy is typically edematous and slightly bruised. The normal episiotomy site shouldnot have redness, discharge, or edema. The majority ofhealing takes place within the first 2 weeks, but it maytake 4 to 6 months for the episiotomy to heal completely(Blackburn, 2007). FIGURE16.3 Assessing lochia. FIGURE16.4 Inspecting perineum.11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 424Lacerations to the perineal area sustained during the birthing process that were identified and repairedalso need to be assessed to determine their healing status.Lacerations are classied based on their severity and tis-sue involvement: First-degree laceration\u2014involves only skin and superficial through perineal Fourth-degree laceration\u2014continues through anterior rectal wall Assess the episiotomy and any lacerations at least every 8 hours to detect hematomas or signs of infection. Large areas of swollen, bluish skin with complaints ofsevere pain in the perineal area indicate pelvic or vulvarhematomas. Redness, swelling, increasing discomfort, orpurulent drainage may indicate infection. Both ndingsneed to be reported immediately. A white line the length of the episiotomy is a sign of infection, as is swelling or discharge. Severe, intractablepain, perineal discoloration, and ecchymosis indicate aperineal hematoma, a potentially dangerous condition.Report any unusual ndings. Ice can be applied to relievediscomfort and reduce edema; sitz baths also can promotecomfort and perineal healing (see \"Promoting Comfort\"in the Nursing Interventions section). Extremities During pregnancy, the state of hypercoagulability protectsthe mother against excessive blood loss during childbirthand placental separation. However, this hypercoagulablestate can increase the risk of thromboembolic disordersduring pregnancy and postpartum. Three factors predis-pose women to thromboembolic disorders during preg- nancy: stasis (compression of the large veins because of thegravid uterus), altered coagulation (state of pregnancy),and localized vascular damage (may occur during birthingprocess). All of these increase the risk of clot formation.CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 425 Cigarette smoking Obesity Preeclampsia secondary to exaggeration of hypercoag- ulable state Hypertension Varicose veins Pregnancy Oral contraceptive use Cesarean birth Previous thromboembolic disease Multiparity Inactivity Advanced maternal age (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007) Because of the subtle presentation of thromboembolic disorders, the physical examination may not be enoughto detect them. The woman may report lower extremitytightness or aching when ambulating that is relieved withrest and elevation of the leg. Edema in the affected leg(typically the left), along with warmth and tenderness,may also be noted. A duplex ultrasound (two-dimensionalultrasound and Doppler ultrasound that compresses the vein to assess for changes in venous flow) in conjunctionwith the physical ndings frequently is needed for a con-clusive diagnosis (Kuntz, Cheesman, & Powers, 2006). Women with an increased risk for this condition during the postpartum period should wear antiembolismstockings or use sequential compression devices to re-duce their risk of thrombophlebitis. Encouraging the client to ambulate after childbirth reduces the incidence ofthrombophlebitis. Emotional Status Assess the woman's emotional status by observing howshe interacts with her family, her level of independence,energy levels, eye contact with her infant (within a culturalcontext), posture and comfort level while holding thenewborn, and sleep and rest patterns. Be alert for moodswings, irritability, or crying episodes. Remember Raina and her \"quiet\" husband, the Muslim couple? The postpartum nurse informs Raina that her doctor,Nancy Schultz, has been called away for emergency surgeryand won't be available the rest of the day. The nurse explainsthat Dr. Robert Nappo will be making rounds for her. Rainaand her husband become upset. Why? Is culturally competentcare being provided to this couple? Bonding and Attachment Nurses can be instrumental in promoting attachment byassessing attachment behaviors (positive and negative) andintervening appropriately if needed. Nurses must be able to Pulmonary embolism occurs in 1 in 2,000 pregnancies and is a major cause of mater- nal mortality (Moses, 2007).Take NOTE! Pulmonary emboli typically result from dislodged deep vein thrombi in the lower extremities. Risk factorsassociated with thromboembolic conditions include: Anemia Diabetes mellitus11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 425identify any family discord that might interfere with the attachment process. Remember, however, that mothersfrom different cultures may behave differently from what isexpected in your own culture. For example, Native Amer-ican mothers tend to handle their newborns less often anduse cradle boards to carry them. Native American mothersand many Asian-American mothers delay breast-feedinguntil their milk comes in, because colostrum is consideredharmful for the newborn (Bowers, 2007). Don't assumethat different behavior is wrong. Meeting the newborn for the rst time after birth can be an exhilarating experience for parents. Although themother has spent many hours dreaming of her unbornand how he or she will look, it is not until after birth thatthey meet face to face. They both need to get to know oneanother and to develop feelings for one another. Bonding is the close emotional attraction to a new- born by the parents that develops during the first 30 to60 minutes after birth. It is unidirectional, from parentto infant. It is thought that optimal bonding of the parentsto a newborn requires a period of close contact within therst few minutes to a few hours after birth (Mercer, 2006).The mother initiates bonding when she caresses her infantand exhibits certain behaviors typical of a mother tendingher child. The infant's responses to this, such as body andeye movements, are a necessary part of the process. Dur-ing this initial period, the infant is in a quiet, alert state,looking directly at the holder.426 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD & Waters, 2006). In a high-risk pregnancy, the attach- ment process may be complicated by premature birth (lackof time to develop a relationship with the unborn baby)and by parental stress due to the fetal and/or maternalvulnerability. Bonding is a vital component of the attachment pro- cess and is necessary in establishing parent-infant attach-ment and a healthy, loving relationship. During this earlyperiod of acquaintance, mothers touch their infants in avery characteristic manner. Mothers visually and physically\"explore\" their infants, initially using their ngertips on theinfant's face and extremities and progressing to massagingand stroking the infant with their ngers. This is followedby palm contact on the trunk. Eventually, mothers drawtheir infant toward them and hold the infant. Mothers alsointeract with their infants through eye-to-eye contact in theen face position (Mercer, 2006) (Fig. 16.5). Generally, research on attachment has found that the process is similar for fathers as for mothers, but the pacemay be different. Like mothers, fathers manifest attach-ment behaviors during pregnancy; indeed, Grossman et al.(2006) found that the best predictor of early postnatalattachment for fathers is fetal attachment. Becoming afather requires a man to build on the experiences he hashad throughout childhood and adolescence. Fathersdevelop an emotional tie with their infants in a variety ofways. They seek and maintain closeness with the infantand can recognize characteristics of the infant. They feela sense of responsibility for the infant's growth and devel-opment (Wilson et al., 2007). Attachment is a process; it does not occur instanta- neously, even though many parents believe in a roman-ticized version of attachment, which happens right afterbirth. A delay in the attachment process can occur if amother's physical and emotional states are adversely af-fected by exhaustion, pain, the absence of a support system,anesthesia, or an unwanted outcome (Feldman, 2007). The length of time necessary for bonding depends on the health of the infant and mother, as well as the circumstances surrounding thelabor and birth (Fowles & Horowitz, 2006).Take NOTE! Attachment is the development of strong affection between an infant and a signicant other (mother, father,sibling, and caretaker) (Grossman, Grossman, & Waters,2006). This tie between two people is psychological rather than biological, and it does not occur overnight. Theprocess of attachment follows a progressive or develop-mental course that changes over time. Attachment is anindividualized and multifactorial process that differs basedon the health of the infant, the mother, environmentalcircumstances, and the quality of care the infant receives(Wilson et al., 2007). It occurs through mutually satis-fying experiences. Maternal attachment begins duringpregnancy as the result of fetal movement and maternalfantasies about the infant and continues through thebirth and postpartum periods. Attachment behaviors in-clude seeking, staying close to, and exchanging gratify-ing experiences with the infant (Grossman, Grossman, FIGURE16.5 En face position. 11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 426CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 427 ent's expectations. If the infant does not meet these expec- tations, attachment can be delayed (Wilson et al., 2007). Factors associated with the health care facility or birthing unit can also hinder attachment. These include: Separation of infant and parents immediately after birth and for long periods during the day Policies that discourage unwrapping and exploring the infant Intensive care environment, restrictive visiting policies Staff indifference or lack of support for parent's care- taking attempts and abilities Critical Attributes of Attachment The terms \"bonding\" and \"attachment\" are often usedinterchangeably, even though they involve different timeframes and interactions. Attachment stages include prox-imity, reciprocity, and commitment. Proximity refers to the physical and psychological experience of the parents being close to their infant. Thisattribute has three dimensions: 1. Contact\u2014The sensory experiences of touching, hold- ing, and gazing at the infant are part of proximity-seeking behavior. 2. Emotional state\u2014The emotional state emerges from the affective experience of the new parents towardtheir infant and their parental role. 3. Individualization\u2014Parents are aware of the need to differentiate the infant's needs from themselves andto recognize and respond to them appropriately,making the attachment process also, in some way,one of detachment. Reciprocity is the process by which the infant's abili- ties and behaviors elicit parental response. Reciprocity isdescribed by two dimensions: complementary behaviorand sensitivity. Complementary behavior involves takingturns and stopping when the other is not interested or be-comes tired. An infant can coo and stare at the parent toelicit a similar parental response to complement his or herbehavior. Parents who are sensitive and responsive to theirinfant's cues will promote their development and growth.Parents who become skilled at recognizing the ways theirinfant communicates will respond appropriately by smil-ing, vocalizing, touching, and kissing. Commitment refers to the enduring nature of the rela- tionship. The components of this are twofold: centralityand parent role exploration. In centrality, parents placethe infant at the center of their lives. They acknowledgeand accept their responsibility to promote the infant'ssafety, growth, and development. Parent role explorationis the parents' ability to nd their own way and integratethe parental identity into themselves (Grossman, Gross-man, & Waters, 2006). Many midwives teach fathers to massage their partners, which has been proven to have a positive effect on the pregnancy, labor, bondingand attachment, and perhaps on family dynamics(Whitehouse, 2006).Take NOTE! The developmental task for the infant is learning to differentiate between trust and mistrust. If the mother orcaretaker is consistently responsive to the infant's care,meeting the baby's physical and psychological needs, theinfant will likely learn to trust the caretaker, view the worldas a safe place, and grow up to be secure, self-reliant, trust-ing, cooperative, and helpful. However, if the infant'sneeds are not met, the child is more likely to face develop-mental delays, neglect, and child abuse (Logsdon, Wisner,& Pinto-Foltz, 2006). \"Becoming\" a parent may take 4 to 6 months. The transition to parenthood, according to Mercer (2006),involves four stages: 1. Commitment, attachment, and preparation for an infant during pregnancy 2. Acquaintance with and increasing attachment to the infant, learning how to care for the infant, and physi-cal restoration during the rst weeks after birth 3. Moving toward a new normal routine in the rst 4 months after birth 4. Achievement of a parenthood role around 4 months The stages overlap, and the timing of each is affected by variables such as the environment, family dynamics,and the partners (Mercer, 2006). Factors Affecting Attachment Attachment behaviors are influenced by three majorfactors: 1. Parents' background (includes the care that the parents received when growing up, cultural practices, relation-ship within the family, experience with previous preg-nancies and planning and course of events duringpregnancy, postpartum depression) 2. Infant (includes the infant's temperament and health at birth) 3. Care practices (the behaviors of physicians, midwives, nurses, and hospital personnel, care and support dur-ing labor, rst day of life in separation of mother andinfant, and rules of the hospital or birthing center)(Grossman, Grossman, & Waters 2006) Attachment occurs more readily with the infant whose temperament, health, appearance, and gender t the par-11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 427Positive and Negative Attachment Behaviors Positive bonding behaviors include maintaining close physical contact, making eye-to-eye contact, speaking insoft, high-pitched tones, and touching and exploring theinfant. Table 16.1 highlights typical positive and negativebehaviors of attachment. Nursing Interventions In terms of postpartum hospital stays today, \"less is more.\"If the woman had a vaginal delivery, she may be dischargedwithin 48 hours. If she had a cesarean birth, she may re-main hospitalized from 72 to 96 hours. This shortened stayleaves little time for nurses to prepare the woman and her family for the many changes that will occur whenshe returns home. Nurses need to use this limited timeto address the following topics: pain and discomfort,immunizations, nutrition, activity and exercise, lacta-tion, dis charge teaching, sexuality and contraception, and follow-up (see Nursing Care Plan 16.1).428 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD various cultures. In many cultures, women and their fam- ilies are cared for and nurtured by their community forweeks and even months after the birth of a new familymember. Box 16.3 highlights some of the major culturalvariants during the postpartum period. Nurses need to remember that childbearing practices and beliefs vary in different cultures. To provide appropri-ate nursing care, the nurse should determine the patient'spreferences before intervening. Cultural practices mayinclude dietary restrictions, certain clothes, taboos, activ-ities for maintaining mental health, and the use of silence,prayer, or meditation. Restoring health may involvetaking folk medicines or conferring with a tribal healer(Srivastava, 2007). Raina and her husband are upset at the thought of having a male doctor care for her because Muslim women are verymodest and prefer having a same-sex care provider. Whatshould the nurse do in this situation? Promoting Comfort The postpartum woman may have discomfort and pain from a variety of sources, such as an episiotomy, perineallacerations, an and sore nipples if breast-feeding. Nonpharma-cologic and pharmacologic measures can be used to de-crease pain and discomfort. Applications of Cold and Heat Commonly, an ice pack is the rst measure used after a vaginal birth to relieve perineal discomfort from edema, anInfant ParentPositive Behaviors Negative Behaviors Smiles; is alert; demonstrates strong grasp reflex to hold parent's nger; sucks well, feeds easily;enjoys being consolable when crying Makes direct eye contact; assumes en face position when holding infant; claims infant as family mem-ber, pointing out common features; expressespride in infant; assigns meaning infant's touches infant,progressing from ngertips to holding; names infant; requests to be close to infant as much asallowed; speaks positively about infantTABLE 16.1 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ATTACHMENT BEHAVIORS Feeds poorly, regurgitates often; cries for long periods, colicky and inconsolable; shows flat affect, rarelysmiles even when prompted; resists holding andcloseness; sleeps with eyes closed most of time;stiffens body when held; is unresponsive to parents;doesn't pay attention to parents' faces Expresses disappointment or displeasure in infant; fails to \"explore\" infant visually or physically; fails to claiminfant as part of family; avoids caring for infant; ndsexcuses not to hold infant close; has negative self-concept; appears uninterested in having infant inroom; frequently asks to have infant taken back tonursery to be cared for; assigns negative attributes to infant and calls infant inappropriate, negativenames (e.g., frog, monkey, tadpole) Sources: Grossman, Grossman, & Waters, 2007; Nash, 2007; Oppenheim & Goldsmith, 2007.

The night nurse reports that she has an episiotomy, complains of a pain rating of 7 points on a scale of 1 to 10, is having difculty breast-feeding, and had heavy lochia most of the night. The nurse also reports that the patient seems focused on her own needs and not on her infant. Assessment this morning reveals the following: B: Breasts are soft with colostrum leaking; nipples cracked U: Uterus is one ngerbreadth below the umbilicus; deviated to rightB: Bladder is palpable; patient states she hasn't been up to void yetB: Bowels have not moved; bowel sounds present; passing present\u2014E: Extremities; over tibia, no warmth or tenderness in calfE: Emotional status is \"distressed\" as a result of discomfort and fatigue NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired tissue integrity related to episiotomy Outcome Identication and Evaluation The woman remains free of infection, without any signs and symptoms of infection, and exhibits evidence of progressive healing as demonstrated by clean, dry, intact episiotomy site. Interventions: Promoting Tissue Integrity Monitor episiotomy site for redness, edema, and signs of infection. Assess vital signs at least every 4 hours to identify changes suggesting infection. Apply ice pack to episiotomy site to reduce swelling. Instruct patient on use of sitz bath to promote healing, hygiene, and comfort. Encourage frequent perineal care and peripad changes to prevent infection. Recommend ambulation to improve circulation and promote healing. Instruct patient on positioning to relieve pressure on perineal area. Demonstrate use of anesthetic sprays to numb perineal area. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Pain related to episiotomy, sore nipples, and hemorrhoids Outcome Identication and Evaluation The woman experiences a decrease in pain, reporting that her pain has diminished to a tolerable level, rating it as 2 points or less. Interventions: Providing Pain Relief Thoroughly inspect perineum to rule out hematoma as cause of pain. Administer analgesic medication as ordered as needed to promote comfort. Carry out comfort measures to episiotomy as outlined earlier to reduce pain. Explain discomforts and reassure the client that they are time-limited to assist in coping with pain. Apply Tucks pads to swollen hemorrhoids to induce shrinkage and reduce pain. Suggest frequent use of sitz bath to reduce hemorrhoid pain. Administer stool softener and laxative to prevent straining with rst bowel movement. Observe positioning and latching-on technique while breast-feeding. Offer suggestions based on observations to correct positioning/latching on to minimize trauma to the breast. Suggest air-drying of nipples after breast-feeding and use of plain water to prevent nipple cracking. Teach relaxation techniques when breast-feeding to reduce anxiety and discomfort. (continued)11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 429episiotomy, or laceration. It is applied during the fourth stage of labor and can be used for the rst 24 hours to re-duce perineal edema and to prevent hematoma formation,thus reducing pain and promoting healing. Ice packs arewrapped in a disposable covering or clean washcloth andare applied to the perineal area. Usually the ice pack isapplied for 20 minutes and removed for 10 minutes. Manycommercially prepared ice packs are available, but a latexglove lled with crushed ice and covered can also be usedif the mother is not allergic to latex. Ensure that the icepack is changed frequently to promote good hygiene andto allow for periodic assessments. The peribottle is a plastic squeeze bottle lled with warm tap water that is sprayed over the perineal area aftereach voiding and before applying a new perineal pad.Usually the peribottle is introduced to the woman whenshe is assisted to the bathroom to freshen up and void forthe rst time\u2014in most instances, once vital signs are sta-ble after the rst hour. Provide the woman with instruc-tions on how and when to use the peribottle. Reinforcethis practice each time she changes her pad, voids, ordefecates, making sure that she understands to direct theflow of water from front to back. The woman can take theperibottle home and use it over the next several weeksuntil her lochia discharge stops. The peribottle can beused by women who had either vaginal or cesarean birthsto provide comfort and hygiene to the perineal area. After the rst 24 hours, a sitz bath with warm water may be prescribed and substituted for the ice pack to430 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD reduce local swelling and promote comfort for an epi- siotomy, perineal trauma, or inflamed hemorrhoids. Thechange from cold to warm therapy enhances vascular cir-culation and healing (Steen, Briggs, & King, 2006). Beforeusing a sitz bath, the woman should cleanse the perineumwith a peribottle or take a shower using mild soap. Most health care agencies use plastic disposable sitz baths that women can take home. The plastic sitz bathconsists of a basin that ts on the commode; a bag lledwith warm water is hung on a hook and connected via atube onto the front of the basin (Fig. 16.6). TeachingGuidelines 16.1 highlights the steps in using a sitz bath. Advise the woman to use the sitz bath several times daily to provide hygiene and comfort to the perineal area.Encourage her to continue this measure after discharge. Some facilities have hygienic sitz baths called Suri- Gators in the bathroom that spray an antiseptic, water, orboth onto the perineum. The woman sits on the toilet withlegs apart so that the nozzle spray reaches her perineal area. Keep in mind that tremendous hemodynamic changes are taking place within the mother during this early post-partum period, and her safety must be a priority. Fatigue,blood loss, the effects of medications, and lack of foodmay cause her to feel weak when she stands up. Assistingthe woman to the bathroom to instruct her on how to usethe peribottle and sitz bath is necessary to ensure hersafety. Many women become lightheaded or dizzy whenthey get out of bed and need direct physical assistance.Staying in the woman's room, ensuring that the emer-NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for ineffective coping related to mood alteration and pain Outcome Identication and Evaluation The woman copes with mood alterations, as evidenced by positive statements about newborn and participation in newborn care. Interventions: Promoting Effective Coping Provide a supportive, nurturing environment and encourage the mother to vent her feelings and frustrations to relieve anxiety. Provide opportunities for the mother to rest and sleep to combat fatigue. Encourage the mother to eat a well-balanced diet to increase her energy level. Provide reassurance and explanations that mood alterations are common after birth secondary to waning hormones after pregnancy to increase the mother's knowledge. Allow the mother relief from newborn care to afford opportunity for self-care. Discuss with partner expected behavior from mother and how additional support and help are needed during this stressful time to promote partner's participation in care. Make appropriate community referrals for mother-infant support to ensure continuity of care. Encourage frequent skin-to-skin contact and closeness between mother and infant to facilitate bonding and attachment behaviors. Encourage client to participate in infant care and provide instructions as needed to foster a sense of independence and self-esteem. Offer praise and reinforcement of positive mother-infant interactions to enhance self-condence in care.Nursing Care Plan 16.1 (continued)11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 430CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 431 BOX 16.3 Cultural Influences During the Postpartum Period African-American Mother may share care of the infant with extended family members. Experiences of older women within the family influence infant care. Mothers may protect their newborns from strangers for several weeks. Mothers may not bathe their newborns for the rst week. Oils are applied to skin and hair to prevent dryness andcradle cap. Silver dollars may be taped over the infant's umbilicus in an attempt to flatten the slightly protruding umbilical stump. Sleeping with parents is a common practice (Bowers, 2007). Amish Women consider childbearing their primary role in society. They generally oppose birth control. Pregnancy and childbirth are considered a private matter; they may conceal it from public knowledge. Women typically do not respond favorably when hurried to complete a self-care task. Nurses need to take cues fromwomen indicating their readiness to complete morningself-care activities (Bowers, 2007). Appalachian Infant colic is treated by passing the newborn through a leather horse's collar or administering weak catnip tea. An asafetida bag (a gum resin with a strong odor) is tied around the infant's neck to ward off disease. Women may avoid eye contact with nurses and health care providers. Women typically avoid asking questions even though they do not understand directions. The grandmother may rear the infant for the mother (Armstrong & Feldman, 2007). Filipino-American Grandparents often assist in the care of their grandchildren. Breast-feeding is encouraged, and some mothers breast- feed their children for up to 2 years. Women have difficulty discussing birth control and sexual matters. Strong religious beliefs prevail and bedside prayer is common. Families are very close-knit and numerous visitors can be expected to the hospital after childbirth (Srivastava, 2007). Japanese-American Cleanliness and protection from cold are essential com- ponents of newborn care. Nurses should give the dailybath to the infant. Newborns routinely are not taken outside the home because it is believed that they should not be exposed tooutside or cold air. Infants should be kept in a quiet,clean, warm place for the rst month of life. Breast-feeding is the primary method of feeding. Many women stay in their parents' home for 1 to 2 months after birth. Bathing the infant can be the center of family activity at home (Bowers, 2007). Mexican-American The newborn's grandmother lives with the mother for several weeks after birth to help with housekeeping andchild care. Most women will breast-feed more than 1 year. The in- fant is carried in a rebozo (shawl) that allows easy access for breast-feeding. Women may avoid eye contact and may not feel comfort- able being touched by a stranger. Nurses need to respectthis feeling. Some women may bring religious icons to the hospital and may want to display them in their room (Srivastava, 2007). Muslim Modesty is a primary concern; nurses need to protect the client's modesty. Muslims are not permitted to eat pork; check all food items before serving. Muslims prefer a same-sex health care provider; male-female touching is prohibited except in an emergency situation. A Muslim woman stays in the house for 40 days after birth, being cared for by the female members of her family. Most women will breast-feed, but religious events call for periods of fasting, which may increase the risk of dehy-dration or malnutrition. Women are exempt from obligatory ve-times-daily prayers as long as lochia is present. Extended family is likely to be present throughout much of the woman's hospital stay. They will need an emptyroom to perform their prayers without having to leave thehospital (Cassar, 2006). Native American Women are secretive about pregnancies and do not reveal them early. Touching is not a typical female behavior and eye contact is brief. They resent being hurried and need time for sitting and talking. Most mothers breast-feed and practice birth control (Srivastava, 2007).11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 431432 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD gency call light is readily available, and being available if needed during this early period will ensure safety andprevent accidents and falls. Topical Preparations Several treatments may be applied topically for tempo- rary relief of pain and discomfort. One such treatment isa local anesthetic spray such as Dermoplast or Ameri-caine. These agents numb the perineal area and are usedafter cleansing the area with water via the peribottle and/ora sitz bath. For hemorrhoid discomfort, cool witch hazel pads, such as Tucks Pads, can be used. The pads are placed atthe rectal area, between the hemorrhoids and the perinealpad. These pads cool the area, help relieve swelling, andminimize itching. Analgesics Analgesics such asibuprofen (Motrin) are prescribed to relieve mild postpar-tum discomfort. For moderate to severe pain, a narcoticanalgesic such as codeine or oxycodone in conjunctionwith aspirin or acetaminophen may be prescribed. In-struct the woman about adverse effects of any medicationprescribed. Common adverse effects of oral analgesicsinclude dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea and vomiting,constipation, and sedation (Skidmore-Roth, 2007). Also inform the woman that the drugs are secreted in breast milk. Nearly all medications that the mothertakes are passed into her breast milk; however, the mildanalgesics (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are consid-ered relatively safe for breast-feeding mothers (Tomasulo,2007). Administering a mild analgesic approximately anhour before breast-feeding will usually relieve afterpainsand/or perineal discomfort. Assisting With Elimination The bladder is edematous, hypotonic, and congested im-mediately postpartum. Consequently, bladder distention,incomplete emptying, and inability to void are common. Afull bladder interferes with uterine contraction and maylead to hemorrhage, because it will displace the uterus outof the midline. Encourage the woman to void. Often, assist-ing her to assume the normal voiding position on the com-mode facilitates this. If the woman has difculty voiding,pouring warm water over the perineal area, hearing thesound of running tap water, blowing bubbles through astraw, taking a warm shower, drinking fluids, or placing herhand in a basin of warm water may stimulate voiding. Ifthese actions do not stimulate urination within 4 to 6 hoursafter giving birth, catheterization may be needed. Palpatethe bladder for distention and ask the woman if she isvoiding in small amounts (less than 100 mL) frequently(retention with overflow). If catheterization is necessary,use sterile technique to reduce the risk of infection. FIGURE16.6 Sitz bath set-up. TEACHING GUIDELINES 16.1 Using a Sitz Bath 1. Close clamp on tubing before lling bag with water to prevent leakage. 2. Fill sitz bath basin and plastic bag with warm water (comfortable to touch). 3. Place the lled basin on the toilet with the seat raised and the overflow opening facing towardthe back of the toilet. 4. Hang the lled plastic bag on a hook close to the toilet or an IV pole. 5. Attach the tubing to the opening on the basin.6. Sit on the basin positioned on the toilet seat and release the clamp to allow warm water to irrigatethe perineum. 7. Remain sitting on the basin for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. 8. Stand up and pat the perineum area dry. Apply a clean peripad. 9. Tip the basin to remove any remaining water and flush the toilet. 10. Wash the basin with warm water and soap and dry it in the sink. 11. Store basin and tubing in a clean, dry area until the next use. 12. Wash hands with soap and water. 11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 432Decreased bowel motility during labor, high iron con- tent in prenatal vitamins, postpartum fluid loss, and theadverse effects of pain medications and/or anesthesia maypredispose the postpartum woman to constipation. In ad-dition, the woman may fear that bowel movements willcause pain or injury, especially if she had an episiotomy ora laceration that was repaired with sutures. Usually a stool softener, such as docusate (Colace), with or without a laxative might be helpful if the client hasdifculty with bowel elimination. Other measures, suchas ambulating and increasing fluid and ber intake, mayalso help. Nutritional instruction might include increas-ing fruits and vegetables in the diet; drinking plenty offluids (8 to 12 cups) to keep the stool soft; drinking smallamounts of prune juice and/or hot liquids to stimulateperistalsis; eating high-ber foods such as bran cereals,whole grains, dried fruits, fresh fruits, and raw vegetables;and walking daily. Promoting Activity, Rest, and Exercise The postpartum period is an ideal time for nurses to pro-mote the importance of physical fitness, help womenincorporate exercise into their lifestyle, and encouragethem to overcome barriers to exercise. The lifestyle changesthat occur postpartum may affect a woman's health fordecades. Early ambulation is encouraged to reduce the riskof thromboembolism and to improve strengthening. Many changes occur postpartum, and caring for a newborn alters the woman's eating and sleeping habits,work schedules, and time allocation. Postpartum fatigueis common during the early days after childbirth, and itCHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 433 may continue for weeks or months (Runquist, 2007). It affects the mother's relationships with signicant othersand her ability to fulll household and child care respon-sibilities. Be sure that the mother recognizes her need forrest and sleep and is realistic about her expectations. Somesuggestions include the following: Nap when the infant is sleeping, because getting un- interrupted sleep at night is difcult. Reduce participation in outside activities and limit the number of visitors. Determine the infant's sleep-wake cycles and attempt to increase wakeful periods during the day so the babysleeps for longer periods at night. Eat a balanced diet to promote healing and to increase energy levels. Share household tasks to conserve your energy. Ask the father or other family members to provide infant care during the night periodically so that youcan get an uninterrupted night of sleep. Review your family's daily routine and see if you can \"cluster\" activities to conserve energy and promote rest. The demands of parenthood may reduce or prevent exercise in even the most committed person. A targetedexercise program and proper body mechanics can helpnew mothers deal with the physical challenges of mother-hood. Emphasize the benets of a regular exercise pro-gram, which include: Helps the woman to lose pregnancy weight Increases energy level so the woman can cope with her new responsibilitiesHedayati, H., Parsons, J., & Crowther, C. A. (2006). Topically applied anesthetics for treating perineal pain after childbirth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD004223. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004223.pub2.Study The perineum (the area between the vagina and rectum) may be traumatized during childbirth following a tear or asurgical cut (episiotomy). Perineal trauma after childbirthaffects millions of women around the world each year. Thedegree of perineal pain and discomfort associated withperineal trauma is often underestimated. Pain often inter-feres with basic daily activities such as walking, sitting,and passing urine and also detracts from the experienceof motherhood. Local anesthetics are easy to use and in-expensive, but their effectiveness needs to be assessed.A study was performed to assess the effects of topicallyapplied anesthetics to relieve perineal pain after childbirthwhile the mother was still in the hospital and after dis-charge. This review of trials found eight studies using avariety of anesthetics.Findings Data were insufcient to show that the topical anesthetics helped relieve perineal pain, and long-term effects werenot assessed. More research is required to assess the effectiveness of topical anesthetics on pain, longer-termoutcomes, women's relationships, and quality of life, aswell as the effectiveness of different topical anesthetics. Nursing Implications Although this study could not validate topical anesthetics'effectiveness in relieving perineal pain, they do provide re-lief to many postpartum women. The nurse should assesseach woman individually and offer other comfort alterna-tives such as warm sitz baths, ice packs, and ambulation.Further research will be needed to offer proof that topicalanesthetics are an effective pain relief measure. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 16.1 Topically Applied Anesthetics for Treating Perineal Pain After Childbirth11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 433 Speeds the return to prepregnant size and shape Provides an outlet for stress (Druxman & Petersen, 2006) More than one third of American women are over- weight (CDC, Ofce of Women's Health, 2007). Al though the average gestational weight gain is small (approxi-mately 25 to 35 lb), excess weight gain and failure to loseweight after pregnancy are important predictors of long-term obesity. Breast-feeding and exercise may help tocontrol weight in the long term (AAP, 2005).434 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD A healthy woman with an uncomplicated vaginal birth can resume exercise in the immediate postpartumperiod. Advise the woman to start slowly and increase thelevel of exercise over a period of several weeks as toler-ated. Jogging strollers may be an option for some women,allowing them to exercise with their newborns. Also, ex-ercise videos and home exercise equipment allow moth-ers to work out while the newborn naps. Exercising after giving birth promotes feelings of well- being and restores muscle tone lost during pregnancy.Routine exercise should be resumed gradually, beginningwith Kegel exercises on the rst postpartum day and, bythe second week, progressing to abdominal, buttock, andthigh-toning exercises (Druxman & Petersen, 2006). Walk-ing is an excellent form of early exercise as long as thewoman avoids jarring and bouncing movements, becausejoints do not stabilize until 6 to 8 weeks postpartum. Exer-cising too much too soon can cause the woman to bleedmore and her lochia may return to bright red. Recommended exercises for the rst few weeks post- partum include abdominal breathing, head lifts, modiedsit-ups, double knee roll, and pelvic tilt (Teaching Guide-lines 16.2). The number of exercises and their durationis gradually increased as the woman gains strength. Remember that cultures have different attitudes toward exercise. Some cultures (e.g., Haitian, Arab- Women who have not returned to their prepregnant weight by 6 months are likely to retain the extra weight (Hackley, Kriebs, &Rousseau, 2007). Encourage women to lose their preg-nancy weight by 6 months postpartum, and refer thosewho don't to community weight-loss programs.Take NOTE! The postpartum woman may face some obstacles to exercising, including physical changes (ligament laxity),competing demands (newborn care), lack of informationabout weight retention (inactivity equates to weight gain),and stress incontinence (leaking of urine during activity). TEACHING GUIDELINES 16.2 Exercising 3. Slowly return to the starting position. 4. Repeat, increasing in frequency as your comfort level allows. Double Knee Roll 1. Lie on a flat surface with your knees bent.2. While keeping your shoulders flat, slowly roll your knees to your right side to touch the flat surface(floor or bed). 3. Roll your knees back over your body to the left side until they touch the opposite side of the flat surface. 4. Return to the starting position on your back and rest. 5. Repeat this exercise several times. Pelvic Tilt 1. Lie on your back on a flat surface with your knees bent and your arms at your side. 2. Slowly contract your abdominal muscles while lifting your pelvis up toward the ceiling. 3. Hold for 3 to 5 seconds and slowly return to your starting position. 4. Repeat several times..Abdominal Breathing 1. While lying on a flat surface (floor or bed), take a deep breath through your nose and expand your abdominal muscles (they will rise up from yourmidsection). 2. Slowly exhale and tighten your abdominal muscles for 3 to 5 seconds. 3. Repeat this several times. Head Lift 1. Lie on a flat surface with knees flexed and feet flat on the surface. 2. Lift your head off the flat surface, tuck it onto your chest, and hold for 3 to 5 seconds. 3. Relax your head and return to the starting position.4. Repeat this several times. Modied Sit-Ups 1. Lie on a flat surface and raise your head and shoul- ders 6 to 8 inches so that your outstretched handsreach your knees. 2. Keep your waist on the flat surface. 11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 434American, and Mexican) expect new mothers to observe a specic period of bed rest or activity restriction; thus,it would be inappropriate to recommend active exerciseduring the early postpartum period (Bowers, 2007). Preventing Stress Incontinence Fifty percent of all parous women develop some degree of pelvic prolapse in their lifetime that is associated withstress incontinence (Thomason & DeLancey, 2007). Themore vaginal deliveries a woman has had, the more likelyshe is to have stress incontinence. Stress incontinence canoccur with any activity that causes an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Postpartum women might considerlow-impact activities such as walking, biking, swimming,or low-impact aerobics so they can resume physical activ-ity while strengthening the pelvic floor. Suggestions to prevent stress incontinence are: Start a regular program of Kegel exercises after childbirth. Lose weight if necessary; obesity is associated with stress incontinence. Avoid smoking; limit intake of alcohol and caffeinated beverages, which irritate the bladder. Kegel exercises help to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles if done properly and regularly (Lemarck, 2007).Kegel exercises were originally developed by Dr. ArnoldKegel as a method of controlling incontinence in womenafter childbirth. The principle behind these exercises isthat strengthening the muscles of the pelvic floor im-proves urethral sphincter function. While providing postpartum care, instruct women on primary prevention of stress incontinence by discussingthe value and purpose of Kegel exercises. Approach thesubject sensitively, avoiding the \"bladder con-trol issues\" are more acceptable to most women.CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 435 may experience lochia drainage for as long as a month after childbirth, describe practices to promote well-beingand healing. These measures include: Frequently change perineal pads, applying and remov- ing them from front to back to prevent spreading con-tamination from the rectal area to the genital area. Avoid using tampons after giving birth to decrease the risk of infection. Shower once or twice daily using a mild soap. Avoid using soap on nipples. Use a sitz bath after every bowel movement to cleanse the rectal area and relieve enlarged hemorrhoids. Use the peribottle lled with warm water after urinating and before applying a new perineal pad. Avoid tub baths for 4 to 6 weeks, until joints and balance are restored, to prevent falls. Wash your hands before changing perineal pads, after dis- posing of soiled pads, and after voiding (Brown, 2006). To reduce the risk of infection at the episiotomy site, reinforce proper perineal care with the client, showingher how to rinse her perineum with the peribottle aftershe voids or defecates. Stress the importance of alwayspatting gently from front to back and washing her handsthoroughly before and after perineal care. For hemor-rhoids, have the client apply witch hazel-soaked pads When properly performed, Kegel exercises have been effective in preventing or improving urinary continence (Lemack, 2007).Take NOTE! Women can perform Kegel exercises, doing ten 5-second contractions, whenever they change diapers, talkon the phone, or watch TV. Teach the woman to performKegel exercises properly; help her to identify the correctmuscles by trying to stop and start the flow of urine whensitting on the toilet (Teaching Guidelines 16.3). Kegelexercises can be done without anyone knowing. Assisting With Self-Care Measures Demonstrate and discuss with the woman ways to pre- vent infection during the postpartum period. Because sheTEACHING GUIDELINES 16.3 Performing Kegel Exercises 1. Identify the correct pelvic floor muscles by contracting them to stop the flow of urine whilesitting on the toilet. 2. Repeat this contraction several times to become familiar with it. 3. Start the exercises by emptying the bladder.4. Tighten the pelvic floor muscles and hold for 10 seconds. 5. Relax the muscle completely for 10 seconds. 6. Perform 10 exercises at least three times daily. Progressively increase the number that you perform. 7. Perform the exercises in different positions, such as standing, lying, and sitting. 8. Keep breathing during the exercises.9. Don't contract your abdominal, thigh, leg, or buttocks muscles during these exercises. 10. Relax while doing Kegel exercises and concen- trate on isolating the right muscles. 11. Attempt to tighten your pelvic muscles before sneezing, jumping, or laughing. 12. Remember that you can perform Kegel exercises anywhere without anyone noticing. 11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 435(Tucks Pads), ice packs to relieve swelling, or hemor- rhoidal cream or ointment if ordered. Ensuring Safety One of the safety concerns during the postpartum period is orthostatic hypotension. When the woman moves froma lying or sitting position to a standing one rapidly, herblood pressure can suddenly drop, causing her pulse rateto increase. She may become dizzy and faint. Be aware ofthis problem and initiate the following safeguards: Check blood pressure rst before ambulating the client. Elevate the head of the bed for a few minutes before ambulating the client. Have the client sit on the side of the bed for a few moments before getting up. Help the client to stand up, and stay with her. Ambulate alongside the client and provide support if needed. Frequently ask the client how her head feels. Stay close by to assist if she feels lightheaded. Additional topics to address concern infant safety. Instruct the woman to place the newborn back in the cribon his or her back if she is feeling sleepy. If the womanfalls asleep while holding the infant, she might drop himor her. Also, instruct mothers to keep the door to theirroom closed when their infant is in their room with them.They should check the identication of anyone who en-ters their room or who wants to take the infant out of theroom. This will prevent infant abduction. Counseling About Sexuality and Contraception Sexuality is an important part of every woman's life. Women want to get back to \"normal\" as soon as possibleafter giving birth, but the couple's sexual relationshipcannot be isolated from the psychological and psycho-social adjustments that both partners are going through. Postpartum women may hesitate to resume sexual re- lations for a number of reasons. Many postpartum womenhave fatigue, weakness, vaginal bleeding, perineal discom-fort, hemorrhoids, sore breasts, decreased vaginal lubrica-tion resulting from low estrogen levels, and dyspareunia.Fatigue, the physical demands made by the infant, and thestress of new roles and responsibilities may stress the emo-tional reserves of couples. New parents may not get muchprivacy or rest, both of which are necessary for sexual pleas-ure (Pastore, Owens, & Raymond, 2007). Men may feel they now have a secondary role within the family, and they may not understand their partner'sdaily routine. These issues, combined with the woman'sincreased investment in the mothering role, can strain thecouple's sexual relationship. Although couples are reluctant to ask, they often want to know when they can safely resume sexual intercourseafter childbirth. Typically, sexual intercourse can be re-436 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD sumed once bright-red bleeding has stopped and the per- ineum is healed from an episiotomy or lacerations. This isusually by the third to the sixth week postpartum. How-ever, there is not a set, prescribed time to resume sexualintercourse after childbirth. Each couple must set theirown time frame when they feel it is appropriate to resumesexual intercourse. When counseling the couple about sexuality, deter- mine what knowledge and concerns the couple have abouttheir sexual relationship. Inform the couple that fluctua-tions in sexual interest are normal. Also inform the coupleabout what to expect when resuming sexual intercourseand how to prevent discomfort. Precoital vaginal lubrica-tion may be impaired during the postpartum period, espe-cially in women who are breast-feeding. Use of water-basedgel lubricants (KY jelly, Astroglide) can help. Pelvic floorexercises, in addition to preventing stress incontinence,can also enhance sensation. Contraceptive options should be included in the dis- cussions with the couple so that they can make an in-formed decision before resuming sexual activity. Manycouples are overwhelmed with the amount of new infor-mation given to them during their brief hospitalization, somany are not ready for a lengthy discussion about contra-ceptives. Presenting a brief overview of the options, alongwith literature, may be appropriate. It may be suitable toask them to think about contraceptive needs and prefer-ences and advise them to use a barrier method (condomwith spermicidal gel or foam) until they choose anotherform of contraceptive. This advice is especially importantif the follow-up appointment will not occur for 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth, as many couples will resume sexual ac-tivity before this time. Some postpartum women ovulatebefore their menstrual period returns and thus need con-traceptive protection to prevent another pregnancy. Open and effective communication is necessary for effective contraceptive counseling so that information isclearly understood. Provide clear, consistent informationappropriate to the woman and her partner's language, cul-ture, and educational level. This will help them select thebest contraceptive method (Engin-Ustun et al., 2007). Promoting Nutrition The postpartum period can be a stressful one for myriadreasons, such as fatigue, the physical stress of pregnancyand birth, and the nonstop work required to take care ofthe newborn and to meet the needs of other family mem-bers. As a result, the new mother may ignore her own nu-trition needs. Whether she is breast-feeding or bottle-feeding, encourage the new mother to take good care ofherself and eat a healthy diet so that the nutrients lostduring pregnancy can be replaced and she can return toa healthy weight. In general, nutrition recommendationsfor the postpartum woman include the following: Eat a wide variety of foods with high nutrient density. Eat meals that require little or no preparation.11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 436 Avoid high-fat fast foods. Drink plenty of fluids daily\u2014at least 2,500 mL (approximately 84 oz). Avoid fad weight-reduction diets and harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. Avoid excessive intake of fat, salt, sugar, and caffeine. Eat the recommended daily servings from each food group (Box 16.4). The breast-feeding mother's nutritional needs are higher than they were during pregnancy. The mother'sdiet and nutritional status influence the quantity and qual-ity of breast milk. To meet the needs for milk production,the woman's nutritional needs increase as follows: Calories: +500 cal/day for the rst and second 6 months of lactation Protein: +20 g/day, adding an extra 2 cups of skim milk Calcium: +400 mg daily\u2014consumption of four or more servings of milk Fluid: +2 to 3 quarts of fluids daily (milk, juice or water); no sodas Certain foods (usually gaseous or strong-flavored ones) eaten by the mother may affect the flavor of thebreast milk or cause gastrointestinal problems for the in-fant. Not all infants are affected by the same foods. If the particular food item seems to cause a problem, urgethe mother to eliminate that food for a few days to see if the problem disappears.CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 437 BOX 16.4 Nutritional Recommendations for Nutrition During the Postpartum Period Recommendations for the Lactating Woman From the Food Guide Pyramid Fruits: 4 servings Vegetables: 4 servings Milk: 4 to 5 servings Bread, cereal, pasta: 12 or more servings Meat, poultry, sh, eggs: 7 servings Fats, oils, and sweets: 5 servings (Dudek, 2006) General Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the Food Guide Pyramid (for the Non-lactating Woman) Fruits: 2 to 4 servings Vegetables: 3 to 5 servings Milk: 2 to 3 servings Breads, grains, and cereals: 6 to 11 servings Meat, poultry, sh, eggs: 2 to 3 servings Fats, oils, and sweets: use sparingly (USDA & USDHHS, 2005) During the woman's brief stay in the health care facility, she may demonstrate a healthy appetite and eat well. Nutritional problemsusually start at home when the mother needs to makeher own food selections and prepare her own meals.This is a crucial area to address during follow-up.Take NOTE! Supporting the Woman's Choice of Feeding Method While there is considerable evidence that breast-feeding has numerous health benets, many mothers choose tofeed their infants formula for the rst year of life. Nursesmust be able to deliver sound, evidence-based informationto help the new mother choose the best way to feed her in-fant and must support her in her decision (Lawson, 2007). Many factors affect a woman's choice of feeding method, such as culture, employment demands, supportfrom signicant others and family, and knowledge base.Although breast-feeding is encouraged, be sure that cou-ples have the information they need to make an informeddecision. Whether a couple chooses to breast-feed orbottle-feed the newborn, support and respect their choice. Certain women should not breast-feed. Drugs such as antithyroid drugs, antineoplastic drugs, alcohol, or street drugs (amphetamines, cocaine, PCP, marijuana) enterthe breast milk and would harm the infant, so women tak- ing these substances should not breast-feed. To pre vent HIV transmission to the newborn, women who are HIVpositive should not breast-feed. Other contraindicationsto breast-feeding include a newborn with an inborn errorof metabolism such as galactosemia or PKU, a currentpregnancy, or a serious mental health disorder that wouldprevent the mother from remembering to feed the infantconsistently. Providing Assistance With Breast-Feeding and Bottle-Feeding First-time mothers often have many questions about feeding, and even women who have had experience withfeeding may have questions. Regardless of whether thepostpartum woman is breast-feeding or bottle-feedingher newborn, she can benet from instruction. Providing Assistance with Breast-Feeding The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2005) recom- mends breast-feeding for all full-term newborns. Exclusivebreast-feeding is sufcient to support optimal growth anddevelopment for approximately the rst 6 months of life.Breast-feeding should be continued for at least the rstyear of life and beyond for as long as mutually desired by11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 437mother and child. Educating a mother about breast- feeding will increase the likelihood of a successful breast-feeding experience. At birth, all newborns should be quickly dried, as- sessed, and, if stable, placed immediately in uninterruptedskin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) with their mother.This is good practice whether the mother is going to breast-feed or bottle-feed her infant. Kangaroo care provides thenewborn with optimal physiologic stability, warmth, andopportunities for the rst feed (Kenner & Lott, 2007). The benets of breast-feeding are clear (see Chap. 18). To promote breast-feeding, the Baby-Friendly Hos-pital Initiative, an international program of the WorldHealth Organization and the United Nations Children'sFund, was started in 1991. As part of this program, thehospital or birth center should take the following 10 stepsto provide \"an optimal environment for the promotion,protection, and support of breast-feeding\": 1. Have a written breast-feeding policy that is commu- nicated to all staff. 2. Educate all staff to implement this written policy.3. Inform all women about the benets and manage- ment of breast-feeding. 4. Show all mothers how to initiate breast-feeding within 30 minutes of birth. 5. Give no food or drink other than breast milk to all newborns. 6. Demonstrate to all mothers how to initiate and maintain breast-feeding. 7. Encourage breast-feeding on demand. 8. Allow no paciers to be given to breast-feeding infants. 9. Establish breast-feeding support groups and refer mothers to them. 10. Practice rooming-in 24 hours daily (UNICEF, 2007). The nurse is responsible for encouraging breast- feeding when appropriate. For the woman who choosesto breast-feed her infant, the nurse or lactation consultantwill need to spend time instructing her how to do so suc-cessfully. Many women have the impression that breast- feeding is simple. Although it is a natural process, womenmay experience some difculty in breast-feeding theirnewborns. Nurses can assist mothers in smoothing outthis transition. and provide one-to-one instructionto breast-feeding mothers, especially first-time breast-feeding mothers, to ensure correct technique. Sugges-tions are highlighted in Teaching Guidelines 16.4.438 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD Tell mothers that they need to believe in themselves and their ability to accomplish this task. They should notpanic if breast-feeding does not go smoothly at rst; ittakes time and practice. Additional suggestions to helpmothers relax and feel more comfortable breast-feeding,especially when they return home, include the following: Select a quiet corner or room where you won't be disturbed. Use a rocking chair to soothe both you and your infant. Take long, slow deep breaths to relax before nursing. Drink while breast-feeding to replenish body fluids. Listen to soothing music while breast-feeding. Cuddle and caress the infant while feeding. Set out extra cloth diapers within reach to use as burping cloths. Allow sufcient time to enjoy each other in an unhurried atmosphere. Involve other family members in all aspects of the infant's care from the start. Providing Assistance With Bottle-Feeding If the mother or couple has chosen to bottle-feed theirnewborn, the nurse should respect and support their de-cision. Discuss with the parents what type of formula theywill use. Commercial formulas are classified as cow'smilk-based (Enfamil, Similac), soy protein-based (Isomil,Prosobee, Nursoy), or formulasfor infants with protein allergies (Nutramigen, Pregestimil,Alimentum). Commercial formulas can also be purchasedin various forms: powdered (must be mixed with water),condensed liquid (must be diluted with equal amountsof water), ready to use (poured directly into bottles), andprepackaged (ready to use in disposable bottles). Newborns need about 108 cal/kg or approximately 650 cal/day (Dudek, 2006). Therefore, explain to parentsthat a newborn will need to 2 to 4 ounces to feel satisedat each feeding. Until about age 4 months, most bottle-fedinfants need six feedings a day. After this time, the num-ber of feedings declines to accommodate other foods in thediet, such as fruits, cereals, and vegetables (Escott-Stump,2007). For more information on newborn nutrition andbottle feeding, see Chapter 18. When teaching the mother about bottle-feeding, provide the following guidelines: Make feeding a relaxing time, a time to provide both food and comfort to your newborn. Use the feeding period to promote bonding by smiling, singing, making eye contact, and talking to the infant. Always hold the newborn when feeding. Never prop the bottle. Use a comfortable position when feeding the new- born. Place the newborn in your dominant arm, whichis supported by a pillow. Or have the newborn in asemi-upright position supported in the crook of yourarm (this position reduces choking and the flow ofmilk into the middle ear). Some newborns \"latch on and catch on\" right away, and others take more time and patience. Inform new mothers about this to reduce theirfrustration and uncertainty about their ability tobreast-feed.Take NOTE! 11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 438 Tilt the bottle so that the nipple and the neck of the bottle are always lled with formula. This prevents theinfant from taking in too much air. Stimulate the sucking reflex by touching the nipple to the infant's lips. Refrigerate any powdered formula that has been combined with tap water. Discard any formula not taken; do not keep it for future feedings. Burp the infant frequently, and place the baby on his or her back or side for sleeping. Use only iron-fortied infant formula for rst year (Lawson, 2007).CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 439 Teaching About Breast Care Regardless of whether or not the mother is breast-feeding her newborn, urge her to wear a very supportive, snug bra24 hours a day to support enlarged breasts and promotecomfort. A woman who is breast-feeding should wear asupportive bra throughout the lactation period. A womanwho is not nursing should wear it until engorgementceases, and then should wear a less restrictive one. The brashould t snugly while still allowing the mother to breathewithout restriction. All new mothers should use plainwater to clean their breasts, especially the nipple area; soapis drying and should be avoided.TEACHING GUIDELINES 16.4 Breast-Feeding Suggestions Explain that breast-feeding is a learned skill for both parties. Offer a thorough explanation about the procedure. Instruct the mother to wash her hands before starting. Inform her that her afterpains will increase duringbreast-feeding. Make sure the mother is comfortable (pain-free) andnot hungry. Tell the mother to start the feeding with an awakeand alert infant showing hunger signs. Assist the mother to position herself correctly forcomfort. Urge the mother to relax to encourage the let-downreflex. Guide the mother's hand to form a \"C\" to access thenipple. Have the mother lightly tickle the infant's upper lipwith her nipple to stimulate the infant to open themouth wide. Help her to latch on by bringing the infant rapidly tothe breast with a wide-open mouth. Show her how to check that the newborn's mouthposition is correct, and tell her to listen for a suckingnoise. Demonstrate correct removal from the breast, usingher nger to break the suction. Instruct the mother on how to burp the infant between breasts. Show her different positions, such as cradle and foot-ball holds and side-lying positions (see Chap. 18). Reinforce and praise the mother for her efforts. Allow ample time to answer questions and addressconcerns. Refer the mother to support groups and communityresources. 11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 439Assessing the Breasts Instruct the mother how to examine her breasts daily. Daily assessment includes the milk supply (breasts will feel full as they are lling), the condition of the nipples (red, bruised,ssured, or bleeding), and the success of breast-feeding.The fullness of the breasts may progress to engorgement inthe breast-feeding mother if feedings are delayed or breast-feeding is ineffective. Palpating both breasts will help iden- tify whether the breasts are soft, filling, or engorged. Asimilar assessment of the breasts should be completed onthe nonlactating mother to identify any problems, such asengorgement or mastitis. Alleviating Breast Engorgement Breast engorgement usually occurs during the first weekpostpartum. It is a common response of the breasts tothe sudden change in hormones and the presence of an increased amount of milk. Reassure the woman thatthis condition is temporary and usually resolves within72 hours. Alleviating Breast Engorgement in the Breastfeeding WomanIf the mother is breast-feeding, encourage frequent feed-ings, at least every 2 to 3 hours, using manual expressionjust before feeding to soften the breast so the newborncan latch on more effectively. Advise the mother to allowthe newborn to feed on the rst breast until it softens be-fore switching to the other side. See Chapter 18 for moreinformation on alleviating breast engorgement and othercommon breast-feeding concerns. Alleviating Breast Engorgement and Suppressing Lactation in the Bottle-Feeding WomanIf the woman is bottle-feeding, explain that breast engorge-ment is a self-limiting phenomenon that disappears asincreasing estrogen levels suppress milk formation (i.e.,lactation suppression). Encourage the woman to use icepacks, to wear a snug, supportive bra 24 hours a day, andto take mild analgesics such as acetaminophen. Encourageher to avoid any stimulation to the breasts that might fos-ter milk production, such as warm showers or pumping ormassaging the breasts. Medication is no longer given tohasten lactation suppression. Teaching Guidelines 16.5provides tips on lactation suppression. Promoting Family Adjustment and Well-Being The postpartum period involves extraordinary physio- logic, psychological, and sociocultural changes in the lifeof a woman and her family. Adapting to the role of a par-ent is not an easy process. The postpartum period is a\"getting-to-know-you\" time when parents begin to inte-grate the newborn into their lives as they reconcile the fan-tasy child with the real one. This can be a very chal lenging440 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD period for families. Nurses play a major role in assisting families to adapt to the changes, promoting a smoothtransition into parenthood. Appropriate and timely inter-ventions can help parents adjust to the role changes andpromote attachment to the newborn. For couples who already have children, the addition of a new member may bring role conflict and challenges.The nurse should provide anticipatory guidance aboutsiblings' responses to the new baby, increased emotionaltension, child development, and meeting the multipleneeds of the expanding family. Although the multiparouswoman has had experience with newborns, do not assumethat her knowledge is current and accurate, especially ifsome time has elapsed since her previous child was born.Reinforcing information is important for all families. Promoting Parental Roles Parents' roles develop and grow when they interact withtheir newborn (see Chap. 15 for information on maternaland paternal adaptation). The pleasure they derive fromthis interaction stimulates and reinforces this behavior.With repeated, continued contact with the newborn, par-ents learn to recognize cues and understand the new-born's behavior. This positive interaction contributes tofamily harmony. Nurses need to know the stages parents go through as they make their new parenting roles t into their life expe-rience. Assess the parents for attachment behaviors (nor-mal and deviant), adjustment to the new parental role,family member adjustment, social support system, andeducational needs. To promote parental role adaptationand parent-newborn attachment, include the followingnursing interventions:TEACHING GUIDELINES 16.5 Suppressing Lactation 1. Wear a supportive, snugly tting bra 24 hours daily, but not one that binds the breasts too tightlyor interferes with your breathing. 2. Suppression may take 5 to 7 days to accomplish.3. Take mild analgesics to reduce breast discomfort.4. Let shower water flow over your back rather than your breasts. 5. Avoid any breast stimulation in the form of sucking or massage. 6. Drink to quench your thirst. Restricting your fluid intake will not dry up your milk. 7. Reduce your salt intake to decrease fluid retention.8. Use ice packs or cool compresses (e.g., cool cab- bage leaves) inside the bra to decrease local painand swelling; change them every 30 minutes(Arenson & Drake, 2007). 11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 440 Provide as much opportunity as possible for parents to interact with their newborn. Encourage exploration,holding, and providing care. Model behaviors by holding the newborn close and speaking positively. Always refer to the newborn by name in front of the parents. Speak directly to the newborn in a calm voice. Encourage both parents to pick up and hold the newborn. Point out the newborn's response to parental stimulation. Point out the positive physical features of the newborn. Involve both parents in the newborn's care and praise them for their efforts. Evaluate the family's strengths and weaknesses and readiness for parenting. Assess for risk factors such as lack of social support and the presence of stressors. Observe the effect of culture on the family interaction to determine whether it is appropriate. Monitor parental attachment behaviors to determine whether alterations require referral. Positive behaviorsinclude holding the newborn closely or in an en face position, talking to or admiring the newborn, ordemonstrating closeness. Negative behaviors includeavoiding contact with the newborn, calling it names,or showing a lack of interest in caring for the newborn(see Table 16.1). Monitor the parents' coping behaviors to determine alterations that need intervention. Positive coping behaviors include positive conversations between thepartners, both parents wanting to be involved withnewborn care, and lack of arguments between the par-ents. Negative behaviors include not visiting, limitedconversations or periods of silence, and heated argu-ments or conflict. Identify the support systems available to the new family and encourage them to ask for help. Ask directquestions about home or community support. Makereferrals to community resources to meet the family'sneeds. Arrange for community home visits in high-risk fami- lies to provide positive reinforcement of parentingskills and nurturing behaviors with the newborn. Provide anticipatory guidance about the following be- fore discharge to reduce the new parents' frustration: Newborn sleep-wake cycles (they may be reversed) Variations in newborn appearance Infant developmental milestones (growth spurts) How to interpret crying cues (hunger, wet, discomfort) Techniques to quiet a crying infant (car ride) Sensory enrichment/stimulation (colorful mobile) Signs and symptoms of illness and how to assess for fever Important phone numbers, follow-up care, and needed immunizationsCHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 441 Physical and emotional changes associated with the postpartum period Need to integrate siblings into care of the newborn; stress that sibling rivalry is normal and offer ways toreduce it Ways to make time together for the couple Appropriate community referral resources In addition, nurses can help fathers to feel more com- petent in assuming their parental role by teaching andproviding information (Fig. 16.7). Education can dispelany unrealistic expectations they may have, helping themto cope more successfully with the demands of fatherhoodand thereby fostering a nurturing family relationship. Explaining Sibling Roles It can be overwhelming to a young child to have anotherfamily member introduced into his or her small, stableworld. Although most parents try to prepare siblings forthe arrival of their new little brother or sister, many youngchildren experience stress. They may view the new infantas competition, or fear that they will be replaced in the par-ents' affection. All siblings need extra attention from theirparents and reassurance that they are loved and important. FIGURE16.7 Father participating in newborn care. Consider THIS! Katie and Molly have been excited about having a new baby sister since they were told about their mother'spregnancy. The 6-year-old twins are eagerly lookingout the front window, waiting for their parents to bringtheir new sister, Jessica, home. The girls are big enough to help their mother care for their new sibling, and forthe past few months they have been xing up the newnursery and selecting baby clothes. They practiced dia-pering their dolls\u2014their mother was specic about notusing any powder or lotion on Jessica's bottom\u2014and (continued)11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 441Many parents need reassurance that sibling rivalry is normal. Suggest the following to help parents minimizesibling rivalry: Expect and tolerate some regression (thumb sucking, bedwetting). Explain childbirth in an appropriate way for the child's age. Encourage discussion about the new infant during relaxed family times. Encourage the sibling(s) to participate in decisions, such as the baby's name and toys to buy. Take the sibling on the tour of the maternity suite. Buy a T-shirt that says \"I'm the [big brother or big sister].\" Spend \"special time\" with the child. Read with the child. Some suggested title include Things to Do with A New Baby (Ormerod, 1984); Betsy's Baby Lap(Horowitz & Sorensen, 1993). Plan time for each child throughout the day. Role-play safe handling of a newborn, using a doll. Give the preschooler or school-age child a doll tocare for. Encourage older children to verbalize emotions about the newborn. Purchase a gift that the child can give to the newborn. Purchase a gift that can be given to the child by the newborn. Arrange for the child to come to the hospital to see the newborn (Fig. 16.8). Move the sibling from his or her crib to a youth bed months in advance of the birth of the newborn. Encourage grandparents to pay attention to the older child when visiting (Rector, 2007).442 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD Discussing Grandparents' Role Grandparents can be a source of support and comfort to the postpartum family if effective communication skillsare used and roles are dened. The grandparents' roleand involvement will depend on how close they live to thefamily, their willingness to become involved, and culturalexpectations of their role. Just as parents and siblings gothrough developmental changes, so too do grandparents.These changes can have a positive or negative effect on therelationship. Newborn care, feeding, and childrearing practices have changed since the grandparents raised the parents.New parents may lack parenting skills but nonethelesswant their parents' support without criticism. A grand-parent's \"take-charge approach\" may not be welcome bynew parents who are testing their own parenting roles, andfamily conflict may ensue. However, many grandparentsrespect their adult children's wishes for autonomy and re-main \"resource people\" for them when requested.FIGURE16.8 Sibling visitation.holding them correctly to feed them bottles. Finally, their mother arrives home from the hospital with Jessica inher arms! The girls notice that their mother is very protective of Jessica and watches them carefully when they care forher. They ght over the opportunity to hold her or feedher. What is special to both of them is the time theyspend alone with their parents. Although a new familymember has been added, the twins still feel special andloved by their parents. Thoughts: Bringing a new baby into an established family can cause conflict and jealousy. What prepara-tion did the older siblings have before Jessica arrived?Why is it important for parents to spend time witheach sibling separately?Consider THIS! (continued) Grandparents' involvement can enrich the lives of the entire family if accepted in the right context and dose by the family.Take NOTE! Nurses can assist in the grandparents' role transition by assessing their communication skills, role expectations,and support skills during the prenatal period. Find outwhether the grandparents are included in the couple's so-cial support network and whether their support is wanted11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 442or helpful. If they are, and it is, then encourage the grand- parents to learn about the parenting, feeding, and childrear-ing skills their children have learned in childbirth classes. This information is commonly found in \"grandparenting\"classes, which introduce new parenting concepts and bringthe grandparents up to date on childbirth practices today. Teaching About Postpartum Blues The postpartum period is typically a happy yet stressfultime, because the birth of an infant is accompanied byenormous physical, social, and emotional changes. Thepostpartum woman may report feelings of emotional lability, such as crying one minute and laughing the next.Postpartum blues are transient emotional disturbances beginning in the rst week after childbirth and are char-acterized by anxiety, irritability, insomnia, crying, loss ofappetite, and sadness (Fooladi, 2006). These symptomstypically begin 3 to 4 days after childbirth and resolve byday 10 (Bennett, 2007). These mood swings may be con-fusing to new mothers but usually are self-limiting. Postpartum blues are thought to affect up to 75% of all new mothers; this condition is the mildest form of emo-tional disturbance associated with childbearing (March ofDimes, 2007). The mother maintains contact with realityconsistently and symptoms tend to resolve spontaneouslywithout therapy within 1 to 2 weeks.CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 443 Preparing for Discharge The AAP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) state that the length of stay in thehealth care facility should be individualized for eachmother and baby. A shortened hospital stay may be indi-cated if the following criteria are met: Mother is afebrile and vital signs are within normal range. Lochia is appropriate amount and color for stage of recovery. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values are within normal range. Uterine fundus is rm; urinary output is adequate. ABO blood groups and RhD status are known and, if indicated, anti-D immunoglobulin has been administered. Surgical wounds are healing and no signs of infection are present. Mother is able to ambulate without difculty. Food and fluids are taken without difculty. Self-care and infant care are understood and demonstrated. Family or other support system is available to care for both. Mother is aware of possible complications (AAP & ACOG, 2007). Providing Immunizations Prior to discharge, check the immunity status for rubella for all mothers and give a subcutaneous injection of rubellavaccine if they are not serologically immune (titer less than1:10). Be sure that the client signs a consent form to re-ceive the vaccine. Nursing mothers can be vaccinated because the live, attenuated rubella virus is not communi-cable. Inform all mothers receiving immunization aboutadverse effects (rash, joint symptoms, and a low-gradefever 5 to 21 days later) and the need to avoid pregnancyfor at least 3 months after being vaccinated because of therisk of teratogenic effects (CDC, 2007). If the client is Rh negative, check the Rh status of the newborn. Verify that the woman is Rh negative and hasnot been sensitized, that the Coombs' test is negative,and that the newborn is Rh positive. Mothers who are Rhnegative and have given birth to an infant who is Rh pos-itive should receive an injection of Rh immunoglobulinwithin 72 hours after birth to prevent a sensitization re-action in the Rh-negative woman who received Rh-positiveblood cells during the birthing process. The usual pro-tocol for the Rh-negative woman is to receive two immunoglobulin (RhoGAM), one at 28 weeks' ges- tation and the second dose within 72 hours after child-birth. A signed consent form is needed after a thoroughexplanation is provided about the procedure, includingits purpose, possible adverse effects, and effect on futurepregnancies. Postpartum blues have been regarded as brief, benign, and without clinical signi- cance, but several studies have proposed a link betweenblues and subsequent depression in the 6 months following childbirth (Vaughn, 2006).Take NOTE! Postpartum blues requires no formal treatment other than support and reassurance because it does not usuallyinterfere with the woman's ability to function and care forher infant. Further evaluation is necessary, however, ifsymptoms persist more than 2 weeks (Ey, 2007). Nursescan ease a mother's distress by encouraging her to vent herfeelings and by demonstrating patience and understandingwith her and her family. Suggest that getting outside helpwith housework and infant care might help her to feel lessoverwhelmed until the blues ease. Provide telephone num-bers she can call when she feels down during the day. Mak-ing women aware of this disorder while they are pregnantwill increase their knowledge about this mood disturbance,which may lessen their embarrassment and increase theirwillingness to ask for and accept help if it does occur. The postpartum woman also is at risk for postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis; these conditionsare discussed in Chapter 22.11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/4/08 2:58 PM Page 443Ensuring Follow-Up Care New mothers and their families need to be attended to over an extended period of time by nurses knowledgeable aboutmother care, infant feeding (breast-feeding and bottle- feeding), infant care, and nutrition. Although continu- ous nursing care stops on discharge from the hospital or birthing center, extended episodic nursing care needs tobe provided at home. Some of the challenges faced by thecurrent families after discharge are described in Box 16.5. Many new mothers are reluctant to \"cut the cord\" after their brief stay in the health care facility and need ex- panded community services. Women who are dischargedtoo early from the hospital run the risk of uterine sub-involution, discomfort at an episiotomy or cesarean site,infection, fatigue, and maladjustment to their new role. Postpartum nursing care should include a range of family- focused care, including telephone calls, outpatient clinics,and home visits. Typically, public health nurses, com-munity and home health nurses, and the health careprovider's office staff will provide postpartum care after hospital dis charge. Providing Telephone Follow-UpTelephone follow-up typically occurs during the rst weekafter discharge to check on how things are going at home.Calls can be made by perinatal nurses within the agencyas part of follow-up care or by the local health departmentnurses. A disadvantage to a phone call assessment is that the nurse cannot see the client and thus must rely on themother or the family's observations. The experienced nurseneeds to be able to recognize distress and give appropriateadvice and referral information if needed.444 UNIT FIVE POSTPARTUM PERIOD Providing Outpatient Follow-Up For mothers with established health care providers such asprivate pediatricians and obstetricians, visits to the ofce are arranged soon after discharge. For the woman with an uncomplicated vaginal birth, an ofce visit is usuallyscheduled for 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth. A woman whohad a cesarean birth frequently is seen within 2 weeks afterhospital discharge. Hospital discharge orders will specify when these visits should be made. Newborn examinationsand further diagnostic laboratory studies are scheduledwithin the rst week. BOX 16.5 Challenges Facing Families After Discharge Lack of role models for breast-feeding and infant care Lack of support from the new mother's own mother if she did not breast-feed Increased mobility of society, which means that extended family may live far away and cannot helpcare for the newborn and support the new family Feelings of isolation and limited community ties for women who work full time Shortened hospital stays: parents may be overwhelmed by all the information they are given in the brief hospital stay Prenatal classes usually focus on the birth itself rather than on skills needed to care for themselves and thenewborn during the postpartum period Limited access to education and support systems for families from diverse cultures Source: Nash, 2007. Infants discharged before they are 48 hours old should be seen by a pediatrician or health care provider by the time they are 96 hours old; those discharged after they are 48 hours old should be seen by the time they are 120 hours old (Langan, 2006).Take NOTE! Outpatient clinics are available in many communities. If family members run into a problem, the local clinic is available to provide assessment and treatment. Clinic vis- its can replace or supplement home visits. Although these clinics are open during daytime hours only and the staffmembers are unfamiliar with the family, they can be avaluable resource for the new family with a problem orconcern. Providing Home Visit Follow-Up Home visits are usually made within the rst week afterdischarge to assess the mother and newborn. During thehome visit, the nurse assesses for and manages commonphysical and psychosocial problems. In addition, the home nurse can help the new parents adjust to the change intheir lives. The postpartum home visit usually includesthe following: Maternal assessment: general well-being, vital signs, breast health and care, abdominal and musculoskele- tal status, voiding status, fundus and lochia status,psychological and coping status, family relationships,proper feeding technique, environmental safety check,newborn care knowledge and health teaching needed(Fig. 16.9 shows sample assessment forms) Infant assessment: physical examination, general appearance, vital signs, home safety check, child development status, any education needed to improve parents' skills The home care nurse must be prepared to support and educate the woman and her family in the following areas: Breast-feeding or bottle-feeding technique and procedures (text continues on page 448)11223-16_CH16.qxd 8/14/08 12:09 PM Page 444CHAPTER 16 NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 445 FIGURE16.9 Sample postpartum home visit assessment form.

The rst 24 hours of life canbe the most precarious (Blackburn, 2007). The neonatal period is dened as the rst 28 days of life. After birth, the newborn is exposed to a whole newworld of sounds, colors, smells, and sensations. The new-born, previously confined to the warm, dark, wet intra-uterine environment, is now thrust into an environmentthat is much brighter and cooler. As the newborn adaptsto life after birth, numerous physiologic changes occur(Table 17.1). Awareness of the adaptations that are occurring forms the foundation for providing support to the newborn dur-ing this crucial time. Physiologic and behavioral changesoccur quickly during this transition period. Being awareof any deviations from the norm is crucial to ensure earlyidentication and prompt intervention. This chapter describes the physiologic changes of the newborn's major body systems. It also discusses thebehavioral adaptations, including behavioral patterns andthe newborn's behavioral responses, that occur during thistransition period. Physiologic Adaptations The mechanics of birth require a change in the newbornfor survival outside the uterus. Immediately, respiratorygas exchange, along with circulatory modications, must456 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN occur to sustain extrauterine life. During this time, as new- borns strive to attain homeostasis, they also experiencecomplex changes in major organ systems. Although thetransition usually takes place within the rst 6 to 10 hoursof life, many adaptations take weeks to attain full maturity. Cardiovascular System Adaptations During fetal life, the heart relies on certain unique struc-tures that assist it in providing adequate perfusion of vitalbody parts. The umbilical vein carries oxygenated bloodfrom the placenta to the fetus. The ductus venosus allowsthe majority of the umbilical vein blood to bypass the liverand merge with blood moving through the vena cava,bringing it to the heart sooner. The foramen ovale allowsmore than half the blood entering the right atrium to crossimmediately to the left atrium, thereby passing the pul-monary circulation. The ductus arteriosus connects thepulmonary artery to the aorta, which allows bypassing ofthe pulmonary circuit. Only a small portion of blood passesthrough the pulmonary circuit for the main purpose ofperfusion of the structure, rather than for oxygenation.The fetus depends on the placenta to provide oxygen andnutrients and to remove waste products. At birth, the circulatory system must switch from fetal to newborn circulation and from placental to pulmonarygas exchange. The physical forces of the contractions oflabor and birth, mild asphyxia, increased intracranialpressure as a result of cord compression and uterine con-tractions, as well as cold stress immediately experiencedafter birth lead to an increased release in catecholaminesthat is critical for the changes involved in the transition toW Respiratory system Site of gas exchange Circulation through the heart Hepatic portal circulation ThermoregulationAir-lled, low-pressure system encourages blood flow through the lungs for gas exchange; increased oxygen content of blood in the lungs contributes tothe closing of the ductus arteriosus (becomes aligament). LungsPressures in the left atrium are greater than in the right, causing the foreman ovale to close. Ductus venosus closes (becomes a ligament); hepatic portal circulation begins. Body temperature is maintained through a flexed posture and brown fat.Comparison Fetus Newborn Fluid-lled, high-pressure system causes blood to be shunted fromthe lungs through the ductus arteriosus to the rest of the body. Placenta Pressures in the right atrium are greater than in the left, encourag-ing blood flow through the foremanovale. Ductus venosus bypasses; maternal liver performs ltering functions Body temperature is maintained by maternal body temperature andthe warmth of the intrauterine environment.TABLE 17.1 ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC COMPARISON OF THE FETUS AND NEWBORN Source: Klossner, N. J., & Hateld, N. (2006). Introductory maternity and pediatric nursing. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 456extrauterine life. The increased levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulate increased cardiac output andcontractility, surfactant release, and promotion of pul-monary fluid clearance (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Fetal Structures Changes in circulation occur immediately at birth as the fetus separates from the placenta (Fig. 17.1). When theumbilical cord is clamped, the first breath is taken andthe lungs begin to function. As a result, systemic vascu-lar resistance increases and blood return to the heart via the inferior vena cava decreases. Concurrently with thesechanges, there is a rapid decrease in pulmonary vascu-lar resistance and an increase in pulmonary blood flow(Blackburn, 2007). The foramen ovale functionally closeswith a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, whichleads to a decrease in right-sided heart pressures. An in-crease in systemic pressure, after clamping of the cord,leads to an increase in left-sided heart pressures. Ductusarteriosus, ductus venosus, and umbilical vessels that werevital during fetal life are no longer needed. Over a period ofmonths these fetal vessels form nonfunctional ligaments. Before birth, the foramen ovale allowed most of the oxygenated blood entering the right atrium from the infe-rior vena cava to pass into the left atrium of the heart. Withthe newborn's rst breath, air pushes into the lungs, trig-gering an increase in pulmonary blood flow and pulmonaryvenous return to the left side of the heart. As a result, theCHAPTER 17 NEWBORN ADAPTATION 457 pressure in the left atrium becomes higher than in the right atrium. The increased left atrial pressure causes the fora-men ovale to close, thus allowing the output from the rightventricle to flow entirely to the lungs. With closure of thisfetal shunt, oxygenated blood is now separated fromnonoxygenated blood. The subsequent increase in tissueoxygenation further promotes the increase in systemicblood pressure and continuing blood flow to the lungs.The foramen ovale normally closes functionally at birthwhen left atrial pressure increases and right atrial pressuredecreases. Permanent anatomic closure, though, reallyoccurs throughout the next several weeks. During fetal life, the ductus arteriosus, located be- tween the aorta and the pulmonary artery, protected thelungs against circulatory overload by shunting blood (rightto left) into the descending aorta, bypassing the pulmonarycirculation. Its patency during fetal life is bycontinual production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by theductus arteriosus (T. W. Hansen, 2007). The ductus ar-teriosus becomes functionally closed within the rst fewhours after birth. Oxygen is the most important factor incontrolling its closure. Closure depends on the high oxy-gen content of the aortic blood resulting from aeration ofthe lungs at birth. At birth, pulmonary vascular resistancedecreases, allowing pulmonary blood flow to increase andoxygen exchange to occur in the lungs. It occurs second-ary to an increase in PO 2coincident with the rst breath and umbilical cord occlusion when is A B FIGURE17.1 Cardiovascular adaptations of the newborn. Note the changes in oxygenation between ( A) prenatal circulation and ( 2:59 PM Page venosus shunted blood from the left um- bilical vein to the inferior vena cava during intrauterine life.It closes within a few days after birth, because this shunt-ing is no longer needed as a result of activation of theliver. The activated liver now takes over the functionsof the placenta (which was expelled at birth). The ductusveno sus becomes a ligament in extrauterine life. The two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein begin to constrict at birth, because with placental expul-sion, blood flow ceases. In addition, peripheral circula-tion increases. Thus, the vessels are no longer needed andthey too become ligaments. Heart Rate During the first few minutes after birth, the newborn'sheart rate is approximately 120 to 180 bpm. Thereafter,it begins to decrease to an average of 120 to 130 bpm(Arenson & Drake, 2007). The newborn is highly depen-dent on heart rate for maintenance of cardiac output andblood pressure. Although the blood pressure is not takenroutinely in the healthy term newborn, it is usually highestafter birth and reaches a plateau within a week after birth.458 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN cell flow. Although a tailored approach is required in the case of cord clamping, the balance of available data sug-gests that delayed cord clamping should be the methodof choice (Levy & Blickstein, 2006; Mercer et al., 2007).Further research is needed to explain the relationshipamong oxygen transport, red blood cell volume, and ini-tiation of breathing, thereby indicating whether early ordelayed cord clamping is benecial. Blood Components Fetal red blood cells are large, but few in number. Afterbirth, the red cell count gradually increases as the cell sizedecreases, because they live in an environment with muchhigher PO 2. A newborn's red cells have a life span of 80 to 100 days, compared to 120 days in adults. Hemoglobin initially declines as a result of a decrease in neonatal red cell mass (physiologic anemia of infancy).Leukocytosis (elevated white blood cells) is present as a re-sult of birth trauma soon after birth. The newborn's plateletcount and aggregation ability are the same as adults. The newborn's hematologic values are affected by the site of the blood sample (capillary blood has higher levelsof hemoglobin and hematocrit compared with venousblood), placental transfusion (delayed cord clamping andnormal shift of plasma to extravascular spaces, whichcauses higher levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit), andgestational age (increased age is associated with increasednumbers of red cells and hemoglobin) (Blackburn, 2007).Table 17.2 lists normal newborn blood values. Respiratory System Adaptations The rst breath of life is a gasp that generates an increasein transpulmonary pressure and results in diaphragmaticdescent. Hypercapnia, hypoxia, and acidosis resulting fromnormal labor become stimuli for initiating respirations.Inspiration of air and expansion of the lungs allow for anincrease in tidal volume (amount of air brought into thelungs). Surfactant is a surface tension-reducing lipopro tein found in the newborn's lungs that prevents alveolar col-lapse at the end of expiration and loss of lung volume. Itlines the alveoli to enhance aeration of gas-free lungs,thus reducing surface tension and lowering the pressurerequired to open the alveoli. Normal lung function is de-pendent upon surfactant, which permits a decrease in Transient functional cardiac murmurs may be heard during the neonatal period as a result of the changing dynamics of the cardiovascularsystem at birth (Wheeler & McCaffrey, 2007).Take NOTE! The fluctuations in both the heart rate and blood pressure tend to follow the changes in the newborn's be-havioral state. An increase in activity, such as wakeful-ness, movement, or crying, corresponds to an increase inheart rate and blood pressure. In contrast, the compro-mised newborn demonstrates markedly less physiologicvariability overall. Tachycardia may be found with volumedepletion, cardiorespiratory disease, drug withdrawal, andhyperthyroidism. Bradycardia is often associated withapnea and is often seen with hypoxia. Blood Volume The blood volume of the newborn depends on the amountof blood transferred from the placenta at birth. It is usu-ally estimated to be 80 to 85 mL/kg of body weight inthe term infant (Blackburn, 2007). However, the volume may vary as much as 25% to 40%, depending on whenclamping of the umbilical cord occurs. Early (before 30 to40 seconds) or late (after 3 minutes) clamping of the um-bilical cord changes circulatory dynamics during transi-tion. Recent studies show the benefits of delayed cordclamping as improving the newborn's cardiopulmonaryadaptation, preventing childhood anemia without increas-ing hypervolemia-related risks, increasing blood pressure,improving oxygen transport, and increasing red blood Hemoglobin 17-20 g/dL BLOODVALUES11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 PM Page 458surface tension at end-expiration (to prevent atelectasis) and an increase in surface tension during lung expansion(to facilitate elastic recoil on inspiration). Surfactant pro-vides the lung stability needed for gas exchange. Thenewborn's rst breath, in conjunction with surfactant,overcomes the surface forces to permit aeration of thelungs. The chest wall of the newborn is floppy because ofthe high cartilage content and poorly developed muscu-lature. Thus, accessory muscles to help in breathing areineffective. One of the most crucial adaptations that the newborn makes at birth is adjusting from a fluid-lled intrauterineenvironment to a gaseous extrauterine environment. Dur-ing fetal life, the lungs are expanded with an ultraltrate ofthe amniotic fluid. During and after birth, this fluid mustbe removed and replaced with air. Passage through thebirth canal allows intermittent compression of the thorax,which helps eliminate the fluid in the lungs. Pulmonarycapillaries and the lymphatics remove the remaining fluid. If fluid is removed too slowly or incompletely (e.g., with decreased thoracic squeezing during birth or dimin-ished respiratory effort), transient tachypnea (respiratoryrate above 60 bpm) of the newborn occurs. Examples ofsituations involving decreased thoracic compression anddiminished respiratory effort include cesarean birth andsedation in newborns (Kenner & Lott, 2007).CHAPTER 17 NEWBORN ADAPTATION 459 Respirations After respirations are established in the newborn, they are shallow and irregular, ranging from 30 to 60 breaths perminute, with short periods of apnea (less than 15 sec-onds). The newborn's respiratory rate varies according tohis or her activity; the more active the newborn, thehigher the respiratory rate, on average. Signs of respira-tory distress to observe for include cyanosis, tachypnea,expiratory grunting, sternal retractions, and nasal flaring.Respirations should not be labored, and the chest move-ments should be symmetric. In some cases, periodic breathing may occur, which is the cessation of breath- ing that lasts 5 to 10 seconds without changes in color orheart rate (Arenson & Drake, 2007). Periodic breathingmay be observed in newborns within the rst few days oflife and requires close monitoring. A baby born by cesarean delivery does not have the same benet of the birth canal squeeze as does the newborn born by vaginal delivery.Closely observe the respirations of the newborn after cesarean delivery.Take NOTE! Lungs Before the newborn's lungs can maintain respiratory func-tion, the following events must occur: Initiation of respiratory movement Expansion of the lungs Establishment of functional residual capacity (ability to retain some air in the lungs on expiration) Increased pulmonary blood flow Redistribution of cardiac output (McLenan, 2007) Initial breathing is probably the result of a reflex trig- gered by pressure changes, noise, light, chilling, compres-sion of the fetal chest during delivery, and high carbondioxide and low oxygen concentrations of the newborn'sblood. Many theories address the initiation of respirationin the newborn, but most are based on speculation fromobservations rather than on empirical research (Wheeler& McCaffrey, 2007). Research continues to search foranswers to these questions. Apneic periods lasting more than 15 seconds with cyanosis and heart rate changes require further evaluation (Kenner & Lott, 2007).Take NOTE! Body Temperature Regulation Newborns are dependent on their environment for the maintenance of body temperature, much more so imme-diately after birth than later in life. One of the most im-portant elements in a newborn's survival is obtaining astable body temperature to promote an optimal transitionto extrauterine (97.9\u00b0 to 99.7\u00b0F). Thermoregulation is the process of maintaining the balance between heat loss and heat production. It is a crit-ical physiologic function that is closely related to the tran-sition and survival of the newborn. An appropriate thermalenvironment is essential for maintaining a normal bodytemperature. Compared with adults, newborns tolerate anarrower range of environmental temperatures and areextremely vulnerable to both under- and overheating.Nurses play a key role in providing an appropriate envi-ronment to help newborns maintain thermal stability. Consider THIS! When I look down at my little miracle of life in my arms, I can't help but beam with pride at this greataccomplishment. She seems so vulnerable and defense-less, and yet is equipped with everything she needs tosurvive at birth. When the nurse brought my daughterin for the rst time after birth, I wanted to see and feelevery part of her. Much to my dismay, she was (continued)11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 459Heat Loss Newborns have several characteristics that predispose them to heat loss: Thin skin with blood vessels close to the surface Lack of shivering ability to produce heat involuntarily Limited stores of metabolic substrates (glucose, glyco- gen, fat) Limited use of voluntary muscle activity or movement to produce heat Large body surface area relative to body weight Lack of subcutaneous fat, which provides insulation Little ability to conserve heat by changing posture (fetal position) No ability to adjust their own clothing or blankets to achieve warmth Inability to communicate that they are too cold or too warm Every newborn struggles to maintain body tempera- ture from the moment of birth, when the newborn's wetbody is exposed to the much cooler environment of thebirthing room. The amniotic fluid covering the newborncools as it evaporates rapidly in the low humidity and air-conditioning of the room. The newborn's temperaturemay decrease 3 to 5 degrees within minutes after leav-ing the warmth of the mother's uterus (99.6\u00baF) (Merceret al., 2007). The transfer of heat depends on the temperature of the environment, air speed, and water vapor pressure or460 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN humidity. Heat exchange between the environment and the newborn involves the same mechanisms as those withany physical object and its environment. These mecha-nisms are conduction, convection, evaporation, and radi-ation. Prevention of heat loss is a key nursing intervention(Fig. 17.2). Conduction Conduction involves the transfer of heat from one objectto another when the two objects are in direct contact witheach other. Conduction refers to heat fluctuation betweenthe newborn's body surface when in contact with othersolid surfaces, such as a cold mattress, scale, or circum-cision restraining board. Heat loss by conduction can alsooccur when touching a newborn with cold hands or whenthe newborn has direct contact with a colder object suchas a metal scale. Using a warmed cloth diaper or blanketto cover any cold surface touching a newborn directlyhelps to prevent heat loss through conduction. Convection Convection involves the flow of heat from the body sur-face to cooler surrounding air or to air circulating over abody surface. An example of convection-related heat losswould be a cool breeze that flows over the newborn. Toprevent heat loss by this mechanism, keep the newbornout of direct cool drafts (open doors, windows, fans, airconditioners) in the environment, work inside an isoletteas much as possible and minimize opening portholes thatallow cold air to flow inside, and warm any oxygen or hu-midied air that comes in contact with the newborn. Usingclothing and blankets in isolettes is an effective means ofreducing the newborn's exposed surface area and provid-ing external insulation. Also, transporting the newborn tothe nursery in a warmed isolette, rather than carrying himor her, helps to maintain warmth and reduce exposure tothe cool air. Evaporation Evaporation involves the loss of heat when a liquid is con-verted to a vapor. Evaporative loss may be insensible (suchas from skin and respiration) or sensible (such as fromsweating). Insensible loss occurs, but the individual isn'taware of it. Sensible loss is objective and can be noticed.It depends on air speed and the absolute humidity of theair. For example, when the baby is born, the body is cov-ered with amniotic fluid. The fluid evaporates into the air,leading to heat loss. Heat loss via evaporation also occurswhen bathing a newborn. Drying newborns immediatelyafter birth with warmed blankets and placing a cap on theirhead will help to prevent heat loss through evaporation.In addition, drying the newborn after bathing will helpprevent heat loss through evaporation. Promptly chang-ing wet linens, clothes, or diapers will also reduce heat lossand prevent chilling.wrapped up like a mummy in a blanket and she had a pink knit cap on her head. I asked the nurse why allthe babies had to look like they were bound for theNorth Pole with all these layers on. Wasn't she awareit was summertime and probably at least 80 degreesoutside? The nurse explained that newborns lose body heat easily and need to be kept warm until their tempera-ture stabilizes. Even though I wanted to get up closeand personal with my baby, I decided to keep the pinkpolar bear outt on her. Thoughts: Newborns may be born with \"everything they need to survive\" on the outside, but they stillexperience temperature instability and lose heatthrough radiation, evaporation, convection, and conduction. Because the newborn's head is the largestbody part, a great deal of heat can be lost if a cap isnot kept on the head. What guidance can be given tothis mother before discharge to stabilize her daughter'stemperature while at home? What simple examples canbe used to demonstrate your point?Consider THIS!

For example, when a newborn is placed in a single- wall isolette next to a cold window, heat loss from radia-tion occurs. Newborns will become cold even thoughthey are in a heated isolette. To reduce heat loss by radi-ation, keep cribs and isolettes away from outside walls,cold windows, and air conditioners. Also, using radiant A. Conduction B. Convection C. Evaporation D.

A warmed transporter is an enclosed isolette on wheels. A radiant warmer is an open bed with a radiantheat source above. This type of environment allows healthcare professionals to reach the newborn to carry out proc-edures and treatments (see Evidence-Based Practice 17.1). Overheating The newborn is also prone to overheating. Limited in-sulation and limited sweating ability can predispose any newborn to overheating. Control of body temperature is achieved via a complex negative feedback system that creates a balance between heat production, heat gain, and heat loss. The primary heat regulator is located in the hypothalamus and the central nervous system. The im-maturity of the newborn's central nervous system makesit difcult to create and maintain this balance. There- fore, the newborn can become overheated easily. Forexample, an isolette that is too warm or one that is lefttoo close to a sunny window may lead to hyperthermia. Although heat production can substantially increase inresponse to a cool environment, basal metabolic rate andthe resultant heat produced cannot be reduced. Over-462 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN heating increases fluid loss, the respiratory rate, and the metabolic rate considerably. Thermoregulation Thermoregulation, the balance between heat loss andheat production, is related to the newborn's rate of metab-olism and oxygen consumption. The newborn attempts toconserve heat and increase heat production in the follow-ing ways: increasing the metabolic rate, increasing mus-cular activity through movement, increasing peripheralvasoconstriction, and assuming a fetal position to hold inheat and minimize exposed body surface area. An environment in which body temperature is main- tained without an increase in metabolic rate or oxygenuse is called a neutral thermal environment (NTE) . Within an NTE, the rates of oxygen consumption andmetabolism are minimal, and internal body temperatureis maintained because of thermal balance. It promotesgrowth and stability and minimizes heat (energy) and waterloss (McLenan, 2007). Because newborns have difcultymaintaining their body heat through shivering or othermechanisms, they need a higher environmental tempera-ture to maintain an NTE. If the environmental tempera-ture decreases, the newborn responds by consuming moreoxygen. The respiratory rate increases (tachypnea) in re- Flenady, V. J., & Woodgate, P. G. (2007). Radiant warmers versus incubators for regulating body temperature in newborn infants. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 00075320-100000000- 00251, Issue 4, 2007.Study Providing a thermoneutral environment is an essential component of the immediate and longer-term care of new-born. The methods currently used include incubators andopen-care systems, with or without modications such asheat shields and plastic wrap. The system used must allowready access to the infant while minimizing alterations inthe immediate environment. This study was performed to assess the effects of radiant warmers versus incubators on neonatal fluid and electrolyte balance, morbidity, and mortality. Eight studies were included in this review. Findings Compared with incubators, radiant warmers caused a statistically signicant increase in insensible water loss and a trend toward increased oxygen consumption that was not statistically signicant. Due to small numbers, effectson important clinical outcomes could not be adequately assessed. A comparison of radiant warmers with heat shields versus incubators without heat shields showed a trend forincreased insensible water loss in the radiant warmer group, but the difference was not statistically signicant. No dif-ference was shown in terms of oxygen consumption. Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess the effects of radiant warmers versus incubators in neona-tal care on important short- and long-term outcomes. Nursing Implications Preventing cold stress in newborns is essential in assisting them to make the physiologic transition to extrauterine life.This study compared two heat sources but failed to reacha clear consensus as to which was better. Nurses canapply these results in caring for newborns by making surethat fluid intake is sufcient to make up for insensible waterloss when the baby is under either heat source. In addition,they can assist in future research about heat sources thatsupport thermoregulation in the newborn. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 17.1 Radiant Warmers Versus Incubators for Regulating Body Temperature in Newborns11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 462sponse to the increased need for oxygen. As a result, the newborn's metabolic rate increases. The newborn's primary method of heat production is through nonshivering thermogenesis, a process in whichbrown fat (adipose tissue) is oxidized in response to coldexposure. Brown fat is a special kind of highly vascular fatfound only in newborns. The brown coloring is derivedfrom the fat's rich supply of blood vessels and nerve end-ings. These fat deposits, which are capable of intense meta-bolic activity\u2014and thus generate a great deal of heat\u2014are found between the scapulae, at the nape of the neck, in themediastinum, and in areas surrounding the kidneys andadrenal glands. Brown fat makes up about 2% to 6% ofbody weight in the full-term newborn (Blackburn, 2007).When the newborn experiences a cold environment, therelease of norepinephrine increases, which in turn stimu-lates brown fat metabolism by the breakdown of triglyc-erides. Cardiac output increases, increasing blood flowthrough the brown fat tissue. Subsequently, this bloodbecomes warmed as a result of the increased metabolicactivity of the brown fat. Newborns can experience heat loss through all four mechanisms, ultimately resulting in cold stress. Cold stress is excessive heat loss that requires a newborn to use compensatory mechanisms (such as nonshivering thermo-genesis and tachypnea) to maintain core body temperature(Cinar & Filiz, 2006). The consequences of cold stress canbe quite severe. As the body temperature decreases, thenewborn becomes less active, lethargic, hypotonic, andweaker. All newborns are at risk for cold stress, particularlywithin the rst 12 hours of life. However, preterm new-borns are at the greatest risk for cold stress and experiencemore profound effects than full-term newborns becausethey have less fat stores, poorer vasomotor responses, andless insulation to cope with a hypothermic event. Cold stress in the newborn can lead to the following problems if not reversed: depleted brown fat stores, in-creased oxygen needs, respiratory distress, increased glu-cose consumption leading to hypoglycemia, metabolicacidosis, jaundice, hypoxia, and decreased surfactantproduction (McLenan, 2007).CHAPTER 17 NEWBORN ADAPTATION 463 Keeping the infant transporter (warmed isolette) fully charged and heated at all times Drying the newborn completely after birth to prevent heat loss from evaporation Encouraging skin-to-skin contact with the mother if the newborn is stable Promoting early breastfeeding to provide fuels for nonshivering thermogenesis Using heated and humidied oxygen Always using radiant warmers and double-wall isolettes to prevent heat loss from radiation Deferring bathing until the newborn is medically stable, and using a radiant heat source while bathing(Fig. 17.3) Avoiding the placement of a skin temperature probe over a bony area or one with brown fat, because it doesnot give an accurate assessment of the whole bodytemperature (most temperature probes are placed overthe liver when the newborn is supine or side-lying) Hepatic System Function At birth, the newborn's liver assumes the functions that theplacenta handled during fetal life. These functions include Nurses must be aware of the thermo- regulatory needs of the newborn and must ensure that these needs are met to provide the newbornwith the best start possible.Take NOTE! To minimize the effects of cold stress and maintain an NTE, the following interventions are helpful: Prewarming blankets and hats to reduce heat loss through conduction FIGURE17.3 Bathing a newborn under a radiant warmer to prevent heat loss.11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 463iron storage, carbohydrate metabolism, blood coagula- tion, and conjugation of bilirubin. Iron Storage As red blood cells are destroyed after birth, the iron is re-leased and is stored by the liver until new red cells need tobe produced. Newborn iron stores are determined by totalbody hemoglobin content and length of gestation. Atbirth, the term newborn has iron stores sufficient to lastapproximately 4 to 6 months (Garfunkel, Kaczorowski, &Christy, 2007). Carbohydrate Metabolism When the placenta is lost at birth, the maternal glucose sup-ply is cut off. Initially, the newborn's serum glucose levelsdecline. Usually, a term newborn's blood glucose level is70% to 80% of the maternal blood glucose level (Kenner& Lott, 2007). Glucose is the main source of energy for the rst sev- eral hours after birth. With the newborn's increased energyneeds after birth, the liver releases glucose from glycogenstores for the first 24 hours. Initiating feedings helps tostabilize the newborn's blood glucose levels. Typically anewborn's blood glucose levels are assessed using a heelstick sample of blood on admission to the nursery and againat approximately 4 hours of age. Bilirubin Conjugation The liver is also responsible for the conjugation ofbilirubin\u2014a yellow to orange bile pigment produced bythe breakdown of red blood cells. In utero, eliminationof bilirubin in the blood is handled by the placenta and themother's liver. However, once the cord is cut, the new-born must now assume this function. Bilirubin normally circulates in plasma, is taken up by liver cells, and is changed to a water-soluble pigment thatis excreted in the bile. This conjugated form of bilirubinis excreted from liver cells as a constituent of bile. The principal source of bilirubin in the newborn is the hemolysis of erythrocytes. This is a normal occurrenceafter birth, when fewer red blood cells are needed to main-tain extrauterine life. When red blood cells die after approximately 80 days of life, the heme in their hemoglobin is converted to biliru-bin. Bilirubin is released in an unconjugated form calledindirect bilirubin, which is fat-soluble. Enzymes, proteins,and different in reticuloendothelial system andliver process the unconjugated bilirubin into conjugatedbilirubin or direct bilirubin. This form is water-solubleand now enters the gastrointestinal system via the bile andis eventually excreted through feces. The kidneys also ex-crete a small amount. Newborns produce bilirubin at a rate of approximately 6 to 8 mg/kg/day. This is more than twice the productionrate in adults, primarily because of relative polycythemiaand increased red blood cell turnover. Bilirubin produc-464 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN tion typically declines to the adult level within 10 to 14 days after birth (Maisels, 2006). In addition, the meta-bolic pathways of the liver are relatively immature and thuscannot conjugate bilirubin as quickly as needed. Failure of the liver cells to break down and excrete bilirubin can cause an increased amount of bilirubin inthe bloodstream, leading to jaundice (Stokowski, 2006).Bilirubin is toxic to the body and must be excreted. Bloodtests ordered to determine bilirubin levels measure biliru-bin in the serum. Total bilirubin is a combination (unconjugated) and direct (conjugated) bilirubin. When unconjugated bilirubin mucous jaundice typically re-sults. Jaundice of the skin, sclera, and mucous membranes thatresults from increased bilirubin blood levels. Visible jaun-dice as a result of increased blood bilirubin levels occursin more than half of all healthy newborns. Even in healthyterm newborns, extremely elevated blood levels of biliru-bin during the rst week of life can cause kernicterus, apermanent and devastating form of brain damage (W. R.Hansen, 2007). Common risk factors for the development of jaun- dice include fetal-maternal blood group incompatibil-ity, male gen- der, trauma during birth resulting in cephalhematoma,cutaneous bruising, polycythemia, previous sibling withhyperbilirubinemia, infections such as TORCH (toxo-plasmosis, other viruses, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpessimplex viruses), and ethnicity such as Asian or NativeAmerican (W. R. Hansen, 2007). The causes of newborn jaundice can be classied into three groups based on the mechanism of accumulation: 1. Bilirubin overproduction, such as from blood incom- patibility (Rh or ABO), drugs, trauma at birth, poly-cythemia, delayed cord clamping, and breast milkjaundice 2. Decreased bilirubin conjugation, as seen (aspirin, acetaminophen, sulfa, alcohol, steroids, antibiotics) (Stokowski, 2006) Jaundice in the newborn is discussed in more detail in Chapter 24. Gastrointestinal System Adaptations The full-term newborn has the capacity to swallow, di-gest, metabolize, and absorb food taken in soon afterbirth. At birth, the pH of the stomach contents is mildly11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 464acidic, reflecting the pH of the amniotic fluid. The once- sterile gut changes rapidly, depending on what feeding isreceived. Mucosal Barrier Protection An important adaptation of the gastrointestinal system isthe development of a mucosal barrier to prevent the pen-etration of harmful substances (bacteria, toxins, and anti-gens) present within the intestinal lumen. At birth, thenewborn must be prepared to deal with bacterial coloniza-tion of the gut. Colonization is dependent on oral intake. Itusually occurs within 24 hours of age and is required for theproduction of vitamin K (Kenner & Lott, 2007). If harm-ful substances are allowed to penetrate the mucosal epi-thelial barrier under pathologic conditions, they can causeinflammatory and allergic reactions (Blackburn, 2007). Stomach and Digestion The stomach of the newborn has a capacity ranging from30 to 90 mL, with a variable emptying time of 2 to 4 hours. The cardiac sphincter and nervous control of thestomach is immature, which may lead to uncoordinatedperistaltic activity and frequent regurgitation. Immaturityof the pharyngoesophageal sphincter and absence of lower esophageal peristaltic waves also contribute to the refluxof gastric contents. Avoiding overfeeding and stimulatingfrequent burping may minimize regurgitation. Most diges-tive enzymes are available at birth, allowing newborns todigest simple carbohydrates and protein. However, theyhave limited ability to digest complex carbohydrates andfats, because amylase and lipase levels are low at birth. Asa result, newborns excrete a fair amount of lipids, result-ing in fatty stools. Adequate digestion and absorption are essential for newborn growth and development. Normally, term new-borns lose 5% to 10% of their birthweight as a result ofinsufcient caloric intake within the rst week after birth,shifting of intracellular water to extracellular space, andinsensible water loss. To gain weight, the term newborn re-quires an intake of 108 kcal/kg/day from birth to 6 monthsof age (Begany & Mascarenhas, 2007). Bowel Elimination The frequency, consistency, and type of stool passed bynewborns vary widely. The evolution of a stool patternCHAPTER 17 NEWBORN ADAPTATION 465 begins with a newborn's rst stool, which is meconium. Meconium is composed of amniotic fluid, shed mucosal cells, intestinal secretions, and blood. It is greenish black,has a tarry consistency, and is usually passed within 12 to24 hours of birth. The rst meconium stool passed is ster-ile, but this changes rapidly with ingestion of bacteriathrough feedings. After feedings are initiated, a transitionalstool develops, which is greenish brown to yellowish brown,thinner in consistency, and seedy in appearance. The last development in the stool pattern is the milk stool. The characteristics differ in breast-fed and formula-fed newborns. The stools of the breast-fed newborn areyellow-gold, loose and stringy to pasty in consistency,and typically sour-smelling. The stools of the formula-fednewborn vary depending on the type of formula ingested.They may be yellow, yellow-green, or greenish and loose,pasty, or formed in consistency, and they have an un-pleasant odor. Renal System Changes The majority of term newborns void immediately afterbirth, indicating adequate renal function. Although thenewborn's kidneys can produce urine, they are limited intheir ability to concentrate it until about 3 months of age,when the kidneys mature. Until that time, a newborn voids frequently and the urine has a low specic gravity (1.001to 1.020). About six to eight voidings daily is averagefor most newborns; this indicates adequate fluid intake(Arenson & Drake, 2007). The renal cortex is relatively underdeveloped at birth and does not reach maturity until 12 to 18 months of age.At birth, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is approxi-mately 30% of normal adult values, reaching approxi- mately 50% of normal adult values by the 10th day of lifeand full adult values by the rst year of life (Blackburn,2007). The low GFR and the limited excretion and con-servation capability of the kidney affect the newborn'sability to excrete salt, water loads, and drugs. Human breast milk provides a passive mechanism to protect the newborn against the dangers of a decient intestinal defense system. Itcontains antibodies, viable leukocytes, and many othersubstances that can interfere with bacterial colonizationand prevent harmful penetration.Take NOTE! Newborns who are fed early pass stools sooner, which helps to reduce bilirubin buildup.Take NOTE! The possibility of fluid overload is increased in newborns; keep this in mind when administering intravenous therapy to a newborn.Take NOTE! 11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 465Immune System Adaptations Essential to the newborn's survival is the ability to respond effectively to hostile environmental forces. The newborn'simmune system begins working early in gestation, butmany of the responses do not function adequately duringthe early neonatal period. The intrauterine environmentusually protects the fetus from harmful microorganismsand the need for defensive immunologic responses. Withexposure to a wide variety of microorganisms at birth, thenewborn must develop a balance between its host defensesand the hostile environmental organisms to ensure a safetransition to the outside world. Responses of the immune system serve three purposes: defense (protection from invading organisms), homeo-stasis (elimination of worn-out host cells), and surveillance(recognition and removal of enemy cells). The newborn'simmune system response involves recognition of thepathogen or other foreign material, followed by activa-tion of mechanisms to react against and eliminate it. Allimmune responses primarily involve leukocytes (whiteblood cells). The immune system's responses can be divided into two categories: natural and acquired immunity. Thesemechanisms are interrelated and interdependent; bothare required for immunocompetency. Natural Immunity Natural immunity includes responses or mechanisms thatdo not require previous exposure to the microorganismor antigen to operate efciently. Physical barriers (suchas intact skin and mucous membranes), chemical barriers(such as gastric acids and digestive enzymes), and residentnonpathologic organisms make up the new born's natural immune system. Natural immunity involves the most basichost defense responses: ingestion and killing of micro-organisms by phagocytic cells. Acquired Immunity Acquired immunity involves two primary processes: (1) thedevelopment of circulating antibodies or immunoglobulinscapable of targeting specic invading agents (antigens) for destruction and (2) formation of activated lymphocytesdesigned to destroy foreign invaders. Acquired immunityis absent until after the rst invasion by a foreign organ-ism or toxin. Immunoglobulins are subdivided into ve classes: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. The newborn depends onthree immunoglobulins for defense mechanisms: IgG, IgA,and IgM. major immunoglobulin and the most abun- dant, making up about 80% of all circulating antibodies(Blackburn, 2007). It is found in serum and interstitialfluid. It is the only class able to cross the placenta, withactive placental transfer beginning at approximately 20 to466 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN 22 weeks' gestation. IgG produces antibodies against bac- teria, bacterial toxins, and viral agents. IgA is the second most abundant immunoglobulin in the serum. IgA does not cross the placenta, and maxi-mum levels are reached during childhood. This immuno-globulin is believed to protect mucous membranes from viruses and bacteria. IgA is predominantly found in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, tears, saliva,colostrum, and breast milk. A major source of IgA is human breast milk, so breastfeeding is believed to have signicant immunologic advantages over formulafeeding (Blackburn, 2007).Take NOTE! IgM is found in blood and lymph fluid and is the rst immunoglobulin to respond to infection. It does not crossthe placenta, and levels are generally low at birth unlessthere is a congenital intrauterine infection. IgM offers amajor source of protection from blood-borne infections.The predominant antibodies formed during neonatal orintrauterine infection are of this class. Integumentary System Adaptations The most important function of the skin is to provide aprotective barrier between the body and the environ-ment. It limits the loss of water, prevents absorption ofharmful agents, protects thermoregulation and fat stor-age, and protects against physical trauma. The epidermalbarrier begins to develop during mid-gestation and isfully formed by about 32 weeks' gestation. Although theneonatal epidermis is similar to the adult epidermis inthickness and lipid composition, skin development is notcomplete at birth (Hale, 2007). Although the basic struc-ture is the same as that of an adult, the less mature thenewborn, the less mature the skin functions. Fewer brilsconnect the dermis and epidermis in the newborn com-pared with the adult. Also in a newborn, the risk of injuryproducing a break in the skin from tape, monitors, andhandling is greater than for an adult. In addition, sweatglands are present at birth, but full adult functioning isnot present until the second or third year of life (Black-burn, 2007). Exposure to air after birth accelerates epi-dermal development in all newborns (Hale, 2007). Newborns vary greatly in appearance. Many of the variations are temporary and reflect the physiologic adap-tations that the newborn is experiencing. Skin coloringvaries, depending on the newborn's age, race or ethnicgroup, temperature, and whether he or she is crying. Skincolor changes with both the environment and health sta-11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 466tus. At birth, the newborn's skin is dark red to purple. As the newborn begins to breathe air, the skin color changesto red. This redness normally begins to fade the rst day. Neurologic System Adaptations The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord,12 cranial nerves, and a variety of spinal nerves that comefrom the spinal cord. Neurologic development followscephalocaudal (head to toe) and proximal-distal (centerto outside) patterns. Myelin develops early on in sensoryimpulse transmitters. Thus, the newborn has an acutesense of hearing, smell, and taste. The newborn's sensorycapabilities include: Hearing\u2014well developed at birth, responds to noise by turning to sound Taste\u2014ability to distinguish between sweet and sour by 72 hours old Smell\u2014ability to distinguish between mother's breast milk and breast milk from others Touch\u2014sensitivity to pain, responds to tactile stimuli Vision\u2014ability to focus on objects only in close prox- imity (7-12 inches away); tracks objects in midline orbeyond inches); this is the least mature sense atbirth (McLenan, 2007) Remember Maria, the new mother who is worried that her daughter can't see? What might the new mother notice abouther daughter's behavior? What might be the new mother'sexpectations? Successful adaptations demonstrated by the respira- tory, circulatory, thermoregulatory, and musculoskeletalsystems indirectly indicate the central nervous system'ssuccessful transition from fetal to extrauterine life, be-cause it plays a major role in all these adaptations. In thenewborn, congenital reflexes are the hallmarks of matu-rity of the central nervous system, viability, and adapta-tion to extrauterine life. The presence and strength of a reflex is an important indication of neurologic development and function. Areflex is an involuntary muscular response to a sensory stimulus. It is built into the nervous system and does notneed the intervention of conscious thought to take effect(Arenson & Drake, 2007). Many neonatal reflexes dis-appear with maturation, although some remain through-out adulthood. The arcs of these reflexes end at different levels of the spine and brain stem, reflecting the function of the cranialnerves and motor systems. The way newborns blink, movetheir limbs, focus on a caretaker's face, turn toward sound,suck, swallow, and respond to the environment are all in-dications of their neurologic abilities. Congenital defectswithin the central nervous system are frequently not overtCHAPTER 17 NEWBORN ADAPTATION 467 but may be revealed in abnormalities in tone, posture, or behavior (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Damage to the nerv-ous system (birth trauma, perinatal hypoxia) during thebirthing process can cause delays in the normal growth, development, and functioning of the newborn. Early iden-tication may help to identify the cause and to start early intervention to decrease long-term complications or per-manent sequelae. Newborn reflexes are assessed to evaluate neuro- logic function and development. Absent or abnormal re-flexes in a newborn, persistence of a reflex past the agewhen it is normally lost, or redevelopment of an infantilereflex in an older child or adult may indicate neurologicpathology. (See Chapter 18 for a description of newbornreflex assessment.) The Healthy Start nurse explained to Maria that all newborns are born with some degree of myopia (can't seedistances) and that 20/20 vision isn't generally achieveduntil 2 years of age. What developmental informationshould the nurse discuss with Maria? Behavioral Adaptations In addition to adapting physiologically, the newborn also adapts behaviorally. All newborns progress through a spe-cic pattern of events after birth, regardless of their gesta- tional age or the type of birth they experienced. Behavioral Patterns The newborn usually demonstrates a predictable patternof behavior during the rst several hours after birth, char-acterized by two periods of reactivity separated by a sleepphase. Behavioral adaptation is a dened progression ofevents triggered by stimuli from the extrauterine environ-ment after birth. First Period of Reactivity The rst period of reactivity begins at birth and lasts for30 minutes. The newborn is alert and moving and mayappear hungry. This period is characterized by myoclonicmovements of the eyes, spontaneous Moro reflexes, suck-ing motions, chewing, rooting, and ne tremors of the ex-tremities (Dabrowski, 2007). Respiration and heart rateare elevated but gradually begin to slow as the next pe-riod begins. This period of alertness allows parents to interact with their newborn and to enjoy close contact with their newbaby (Fig. 17.4). The appearance of sucking and rootingbehaviors provides a good opportunity for initiating breast-feeding. Many newborns latch on the nipple and suck well at this rst experience.11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 467Period of Deceased Responsiveness At 30 to 120 minutes of age, the newborn enters the sec- ond stage of transition\u2014that of sleep or a decrease in ac-tivity. This phase is referred to as a period of decreasedresponsiveness. Movements are less jerky and less fre-quent. Heart and respiratory rates decline as the newbornenters the sleep phase. The muscles become relaxed, andresponsiveness to outside stimuli diminishes. During thisphase, it is difcult to arouse or interact with the new-born. No interest in sucking is shown. This quiet timecan be used for both mother and newborn to remain closeand rest together after labor and the birthing experience. Second Period of Reactivity The second period of reactivity begins as the newbornawakens and shows an interest in environmental stimuli.This period lasts 2 to 8 hours in the normal newborn(Vandenberg, 2007). Heart and respiratory rates increase.Peristalsis also increases. Thus, it is not uncommon forthe newborn to pass meconium during this period. Inaddition, motor activity and muscle tone increase inconjunction with an increase in muscular coordination(Fig. 17.5). Interaction between the mother and the newborn dur- ing this second period of reactivity is encouraged if themother has rested and desires it. This period also provides a good opportunity for the parents to examine their new-born and ask questions.468 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Newborn Behavioral Responses Newborns demonstrate several predictable responses when interacting with their environment. How they reactto the world around them is termed a neurobehavioral response . It comprises predictable periods that are prob- ably triggered by external stimuli. Expected newborn behaviors include orientation, ha- bituation, motor maturity, self-quieting ability, and socialbehaviors. Any deviation in behavioral responses requiresfurther assessment, because it may indicate a complexneurobehavioral problem. Orientation The response of newborns to stimuli is called orientation.They become more alert when they sense a new stimulusin their environment. Orientation reflects newborns' re-sponse to auditory and visual stimuli, demonstrated bytheir movement of head and eyes to focus on that stimu-lus. Newborns prefer the human face and bright shinyobjects. As the face or object comes into their line of vi-sion, newborns respond by staring at the object intently.Newborns use this sensory capacity to become familiarwith people and objects in their surroundings. Remember Maria, who was concerned about her newborn daughter's vision? She told the nurse that her daughterdidn't show any interest in her pastel-colored homemademobile she had hung across the room from her crib. Whatsuggestions can the nurse make to Maria regarding theplacement of the mobile and the types and colors of objectsused to promote orientation in her newborn daughter? Habituation Habituation is the newborn's ability to process and re-spond to visual and auditory stimuli\u2014that is, how well FIGURE17.4 The rst period of reactivity is an optimal time for interaction.FIGURE17.5 Newborn during the second period of reactivity. Note the newborn's wide-eyed interest. Teaching about feeding, positioning for feeding, and diaper-changing techniques can be reinforced during this time.Take NOTE! 11223-17_UT6-CH17.qxd 8/4/08 2:59 PM Page 468and appropriately he or she responds to the environment. Habituation is the ability to block out external stimuliafter the newborn has become accustomed to the activity.During the first 24 hours after birth, newborns shouldincrease their ability to habituate to environmental stimuli and sleep. Habituation provides a useful indicator of theirneurobehavioral intactness. Motor Maturity Motor maturity depends on gestational age and involvesevaluation of posture, tone, coordination, and movements.These activities enable newborns to control and coordi-nate movement. When stimulated, newborns with goodmotor organization demonstrate movements that arerhythmic and spontaneous. Bringing the hand up to themouth is an example of good motor organization. Asnewborns adapt to their new environment, smoothermovements should be observed. Such motor behavior isa good indicator of the newborn's ability to respond andadapt accordingly\u2014that is, process stimuli appropriatelyby the central nervous system. Self-Quieting Ability Self-quieting ability refers to newborns' ability to quietand comfort themselves. Newborns vary in their ability toconsole themselves or to be consoled. \"Consolability\" ishow newborns are able to change from the crying state toan active alert, quiet alert, drowsy, or sleep state. Theyconsole themselves by hand-to-mouth movements andsucking, alerting to external stimuli and motor activity(Arenson & Drake, 2007). Assisting parents to identifyconsoling behaviors to quiet their newborn if the new-born is not able to self-quiet is important. These behav-iors include rocking, holding, gently patting, and softlysinging to them. Social Behaviors Social behaviors include cuddling and snuggling intothe arms of the parent when the newborn is held. Usu-ally newborns are very sensitive to being touched, cud-dled, and held. Cuddliness is very important to parents,because they frequently gauge their ability to care fortheir newborn by the newborn's acceptance or positiveresponse to their actions. This can be assessed by thedegree to which the newborn nestles into the contoursof the holder's arms. Most newborns cuddle, but somewill resist.

It is a criticalphysiologic function that is closely related to the tran-sition and survival of the newborn. /H18546The newborn's primary method of heat production is through nonshivering thermogenesis, a process in whichbrown fat (adipose tissue) is oxidized in response to coldexposure. Brown fat is a special kind of highly vascularfat found only in newborns. /H18546Heat loss in the newborn is the result of four mecha- nisms: conduction, convection, evaporation, and radiation. /H18546Responses of the immune system serve three purposes: defense (protection from invading organisms), homeo-stasis (elimination of worn-out host cells), and surveil-lance (recognition and removal of enemy cells). /H18546In the newborn, congenital reflexes are the hallmarks of maturity of the central nervous system, viability, andadaptation to extrauterine life. /H18546The newborn usually demonstrates a predictable pat- tern of behavior during the rst several hours afterbirth, characterized by two periods of reactivity sepa-rated by a sleep phase.

In their new orexpanded role as parents, they will face many demandsand challenges. For most, this is a wonderful, exciting timelled with many discoveries and much information. Parents learn as they watch the nurse interacting with their newborn. Nurses play a major role in teaching parentsabout normal newborn characteristics and about ways tofoster optimal growth and development. This role is evenmore important today because of limited hospital stays. The newborn has come from a dark, small, enclosed space in the mother's uterus into the bright, cold extra-uterine environment. Nurses can easily forget that they arecaring for a small human being who is experiencing his orher rst taste of human interaction outside the uterus. Thenewborn period is an extremely important one, and twoNational Health Goals have been developed to addressthis critical period.474 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN It is also easy to overlook the intensity with which parents and visitors observe the actions of nurses as theycare for the new family member. Nurses need to serve asa model for giving nurturing care to newborns. This chapter provides information about assessment and interventions in the period immediately following thebirth of a newborn and during the early newborn period. Nursing Management During the Immediate Newborn Period The period of transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life occurs during the rst several hours after birth. Dur-ing this time, the newborn is undergoing numerous adap-tations, many of which are occurring simultaneously (seeChap. 17 for more information on the newborn's adapta-tion). The neonate's temperature, respiration, and cardio-vascular dynamics stabilize during this period. Closeobservation of the newborn's status is essential. Carefulexamination of the newborn at birth can detect anom-alies, birth injuries, and disorders that can compromiseadaptation to extrauterine life. Problems that occur dur-ing this critical time can have a lifelong impact. Assessment The initial newborn assessment is completed in the birthingarea to determine whether the newborn is stable enough tostay with the parents or whether resuscitation or imme-diate interventions are necessary. A second assessment isdone within the first 2 to 4 hours, when the newborn isadmitted to the nursery. A third assessment is completedbefore discharge. The purpose of these assessments is todetermine whether the baby is normal, to provide infor-mation to the parents, and to identify apparent physicalabnormalities (Arenson & Drake, 2007). During the initial newborn assessment, look for signs that might indicate a problem, including: Nasal flaring Chest retractions Grunting on crackles (rales), wheezing, rates 60 breaths/minute; bradypnea, less than 25 breaths/minute) Flaccid body posture Abnormal heart rates (tachycardia, more than 160 bpm; bradycardia, less than 100 bpm) Abnormal newborn size: small or large for gestational age If any of these ndings are noted, medical intervention may be necessary.I Increase the proportion of mothers who breast-feedtheir babies during the earlypostpartum period from abaseline of 64% to 75%. Increase the proportion of mothers who breast-feed at6 months from a baseline of29% to 50%. Increase the proportion of mothers who breast-feed at1 year from a baseline of16% to 25%. Ensure appropriate newborn bloodspot screening, new-born hearing screening, follow-up testing, and referral services.

An additional Apgar assessment is doneat 10 minutes if the 5-minute score is less than 7 points(Keenan, 2006). Assessment of the newborn at 1 minuteprovides data about the newborn's initial adaptation toextrauterine life. Assessment at 5 minutes provides a clearerindication of the newborn's overall central nervous sys-tem status. Five parameters are assessed with Apgar scoring. A quick way to remember the parameters of Apgar scoringis as follows: A =appearance (color) P =pulse (heart rate) G =grimace (reflex irritability) A =activity (muscle tone) R =respiratory (respiratory effort) Each parameter is assigned a score ranging from 0 to 2 points. A score of 0 points indicates an absent or poorresponse; a score of 2 points indicates a normal response(Table 18.1). A normal newborn's score should be 8 to10 points. The higher the score, the better the condition ofthe newborn. If the Apgar score is 8 points or higher, nointervention is needed other than supporting normal respi-ratory efforts and maintaining thermoregulation. Scoresof 4 to 7 points signify moderate difculty and scores of0 to 3 points represent severe distress in adjusting to extra-uterine life. The Apgar score is influenced by the presenceof infection, congenital anomalies, physiologic immaturity,CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 475 Length and Weight Parents are eager to know their newborn's length and weight. These measurements are taken soon after birth. Adisposable tape measure or a built-in measurement boardlocated on the side of the scale can be used. Length ismeasured from the head of the newborn to the heel withthe newborn unclothed (Fig. 18.1). Because of the flexedposition of the newborn after birth, place the newborn ina supine position and extend the leg completely whenmeasuring the length. The expected length of a full-termnewborn is usually 48 to 53 cm (19 to 21 inches). Mold-ing can affect measurement (Dillon, 2007). Although Apgar scoring is done at 1 and 5 minutes, it also can be used as a guide during the immediate newborn period to evaluate thenewborn's status for any changes because it focuses oncritical parameters that must be assessed throughoutthe early transition period.Take NOTE! Heart rate (auscultation of apical heart rate for 1 full minute) Respiratory effort (observation of the volume and vigor of the newborn'scry; auscultation of depth and rateof respirations) Muscle tone (observation of extent of flexion in the newborn's extremitiesand newborn's resistance when theextremities are pulled away fromthe body) Reflex irritability (flicking of the soles of the feet or suctioning of the nosewith a bulb syringe) Skin color (inspection of trunk and extremities with the appropriatecolor for ethnicity appearing withinminutes after birth)Parameter (Assessment Technique) 0 Point 1 Point 2 Points Absent Apneic Limp, flaccid No response Cyanotic or paleSlow (<100 bpm) Slow, irregular, shallow Some flexion, limited re- sistance to extension Grimace or frown when irritated Appropriate body color; blue extremities (acrocyanosis)>100 bpm Regular respirations (usually 30-60 breaths/minute),strong, good cry Tight flexion, good resistance to extension with quick return to flexed positionafter extension Sneeze, cough, or vigorous cry Completely appropriate color (pink on both trunk and extremities)TABLE 18.1 APGARSCORING FOR NEWBORNSmaternal sedation via medications, and neuromuscular disorders (Keenan, 2006). When the newborn experiences physiologic depres- sion, the Apgar score characteristics disappear in a pre-dictable manner: rst the pink coloration is lost, next therespiratory effort, and then the tone, followed by reflexirritability and nally heart rate (Kenner & Lott, 2007).11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 475Most often, newborns are weighed using a digital scale that reads the weight in grams. Typically, the term new-born weighs 2,700 to 4,000 g (6 to 9 lb; Fig. 18.2). Birth-weights less than 10% or more than 90% on a growth chart are outside the normal range and need further investiga-tion. Weights taken at later times are compared with previ-ous weights and are documented with regard to gain or losson a nursing flow sheet. Newborns typically lose approx-imately 10% of their initial birth weight by 3 to 4 days ofage secondary to loss of meconium, extracellular fluid, and476 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN limited food intake. This weight loss is usually regained by the 10th day of life (Kliegman et al., 2007). Newborns can be classied by their birthweight re- gardless of their gestational age 2007a) as <1,000 g (<2.5 lb) Vital Signs Heart rate and respiratory rate are assessed immediately after birth with Apgar scoring. Heart rate, obtained bytaking an apical pulse for 1 full minute, typically is 120 to160 bpm. Newborns' respirations are assessed when theyare quiet or sleeping. Place a stethoscope on the right sideof the chest and count the breaths for 1 full minute toidentify any irregularities. The newborn respiratory rate is30 to 60 breaths/minute with symmetric chest movement. Heart and respiratory rates are assessed every 30 min-utes until stable for 2 hours after birth. Once stable, theheart rate and respiratory rates are checked every 8 hours(Kenner & Lott, 2007). Axillary temperature is typically assessed not imme- diately after birth but on admission to the nursery or whenthe initial newborn assessment is carried out (e.g., theLDR room). The normal axillary temperature for a \u00b0to 37.5 \u00b0C (97.9 \u00b0to 99.7 \u00b0F). Rectal temperatures are no longer taken because of the risk ofperforation (Blackburn, 2007). The thermometer or tem-perature probe is held in the midaxillary space accordingto manufacturer's directions and hospital protocol. Tem-perature is reassessed every 30 minutes until it has beenstable for 2 hours, then every 8 hours until discharge(Kliegman et al., 2007). Blood pressure is not usually assessed as part of a normal newborn examination unless there is a clinical in-dication or low Apgar scores. If assessed, an oscillometer(Dinamap) is used. The typical range is 50 to 75 mmHg A B FIGURE18.1 Measuring a newborn's length. ( A) The nurse extends the newborn's leg and marks the pad at the heel. ( B) The nurse measures from the newborn's head to the heel mark. FIGURE18.2 Weighing a newborn.

Crying, moving, and late clamping of the umbilical cord will increase sys-tolic pressure (Dillon, 2007). Typical values for newborn vital signs are provided in Table 18.2. Gestational Age Assessment To determine a newborn's gestational age (the stage of maturity), physical signs and neurologic characteristicsare assessed. Typically, gestational age is determined byusing a tool such as the Dubowitz/Ballard or New BallardScore system (Fig. 18.3). This scoring system provides anobjective estimate of gestational age by scoring the spe-cic parameters of physical and neuromuscular maturity.Points are given for each assessment parameter, with alow score of 1 point or 2 points for extreme immaturity to 4 or 5 points for postmaturity. The scores from eachsection are added together to correspond to a specic ges-tational age in weeks. The physical maturity section of the examination is done during the first 2 hours after birth. The physicalmaturity assessment section of the Ballard examinationevaluates physical characteristics that appear different atdifferent stages depending on a newborn's gestational ma-turity. Newborns who are physically mature have higherscores than those who are not. The areas assessed on thephysical maturity examination include: Skin texture\u2014typically ranges from sticky and trans- parent to smooth, with varying degrees of peeling andcracking, to parchment-like or leathery with signicantcracking and wrinkling Lanugo\u2014soft downy hair on the newborn's body, which is absent in preterm newborns, appears withmaturity, and then disappears again with postmaturity Plantar creases\u2014creases on the soles of the feet, which range from absent to covering the entire foot, depend-ing on maturity (the greater the number of creases, thegreater the newborn's maturity) Breast tissue\u2014the thickness and size of breast tissue and areola (the darkened ring around each nipple), whichrange from being imperceptible to full and buddingCHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 477 Eyes and ears\u2014eyelids can be fused or open and ear cartilage and stiffness determine the degree of maturity(the greater the amount of ear cartilage with stiffness,the greater the newborn's maturity) Genitals\u2014in males, evidence of testicular descent and appearance of scrotum (which can range from smoothto covered with rugae) determine maturity; in females,appearance and size of clitoris determinematurity prominent clitoris with clitoris covered by labia suggestsgreater maturity) The neuromuscular maturity section typically is com- pleted within 24 hours after birth. Six activities or ma-neuvers that the newborn performs with various bodyparts are evaluated to determine the newborn's degree ofmaturity: 1. Posture\u2014How does the newborn hold his or her extremities in relation to the trunk? The greater thedegree of flexion, the greater the maturity. For exam-ple, extension of arms and legs is scored as 0 pointand full flexion of arms and legs is scored as 4 points. 2. Square window\u2014How far can the newborn's hands be flexed toward the wrist? The angle is measured andscored from more than 90 degrees to 0 degrees todetermine the maturity rating. As the angle decreases,the newborn's maturity increases. For example, anangle of more than 90 degrees is scored as 1 point and an angle of 0 degrees is scored as 4 points. 3. Arm recoil\u2014How far do the newborn's arms \"spring back\" to a flexed position? This measure evaluates thedegree of arm flexion and the strength of recoil. Thereaction of the arm is then scored from 0 to 4 pointsbased on the degree of flexion as the arms are returnedto their normal flexed position. The higher the pointsassigned, the greater the neuromuscular maturity (forexample, recoil less than a 90-degree angle is scoredas 4 points). 4. Popliteal angle\u2014How far will the newborn's knees extend? The angle created when the knee is ex-tended is measured. An angle less than 90 degreesindicates greater maturity. For example, an angle of 180 degrees is scored as 1 point and an angle of less than 90 degrees is scored as 5 points. 5. Scarf sign\u2014How far can the elbows be moved across the newborn's chest? An elbow that does not reachmidline indicates greater maturity. For example, ifthe elbow reaches or nears the level of the oppositeshoulder, this is scored as 1 point; if the elbow does not cross the proximate axillary line, it is scored as 4 points. 6. Heel to ear\u2014How close can the newborn's feet be moved to the ears? This maneuver assesses hip flexi-bility: the lesser the flexibility, the greater the new-born's maturity. The heel-to-ear assessment isscored in the same 37.5 \u00b0C (97.9 rate (pulse) 120 to 160 bpm; can increase to 180 during crying Respirations 30 to 60 breaths/minute at rest; will increase with crying Blood pressure 50 to 75 mmHg systolic, 30 to 45 mmHg diastolicNewborn Vital Signs Ranges of valuesTABLE 18.2 NEWBORN VITALSIGNS11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 477After the scoring is completed, the 12 scores are to- taled and then compared with standardized values to de-termine the appropriate gestational age in weeks.

Nursing Interventions During the immediate newborn period, care focuses onhelping the newborn to make the transition to extrauterinelife. The nursing interventions include maintaining airwaypatency, ensuring proper identication, administering pre-scribed medications, and maintaining thermoregulation. Maintaining Airway Patency Immediately after birth, a newborn is suctioned to removefluids and mucus from the mouth and nose. Typically, thenewborn's mouth is suctioned rst with a bulb syringe toremove debris and then the nose is suctioned. Suctioningin this manner helps to prevent aspiration of fluid into thelungs by an unexpected gasp. When suctioning a newborn with a bulb syringe, com- press the bulb before placing it into the oral or nasal cav-ity. Release bulb compression slowly, making sure the tipis placed away from the mucous membranes to draw upthe excess secretions. Remove the bulb syringe from themouth or nose, and then, while holding the bulb syringetip over an emesis basin lined with paper towel or tissue,compress the bulb to expel the secretions. Repeat the pro-cedure several times until all secretions are removed.CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 479 Ensuring Proper Identication Before the newborn and family leave the birthing area, be sure that agency policy about identication is followed.Typically, the mother and newborn, and possibly thefather, receive matching identication bracelets. The new-born commonly receives two ID bracelets, one on a wristand one on an ankle. The mother receives a matching one,usually on her wrist. The ID bands usually state name,gender, date and time of birth, and identication number.The same identification number is on the bracelets ofall the family members. These ID bracelets provide for the safety of the new- born and must be secured before the mother and new-born leave the birthing area. The ID bracelets are checkedby all nurses to validate that the correct newborn is broughtto the right mother if they are separated for any period oftime (Fig. 18.4). They also serve as the ofcial newbornidentication and are checked before initiating any pro-cedure on that newborn and on discharge from the unit(AAP, 2007). Taking the newborn's picture within 2 hoursafter birth with a color camera or color video/digital imagealso helps prevent mix-ups and abduction. Some facilitiesuse electronic devices that sound an alarm if the newbornis removed from the area. Newborns' footprints may also be taken, using a form that includes the mother's ngerprint, name, and date andtime of the birth. Some states require footprints of the new-born, although many studies point out that birthing roomstaff members do not take consistently legible footprintssuitable for identication purposes (Kenner & Lott, 2007).Many states have stopped requiring newborn footprints,and thus other means of identication are needed, such ascollecting cord blood at the time of birth for DNA testingand live scans to capture digital forensic-quality prints thatare suitable for identication purposes (Cohen, 2007). Administering Prescribed Medications During the immediate newborn period, two medications are commonly ordered: vitamin K and eye prophylaxis with Gestational age assessment is important because it allows the nurse to plot growth parameters and to anticipate problems related to prematurity, postmaturity, and growth abnormalities.Take NOTE! Always keep a bulb syringe near the newborn in case he or she develops sudden choking or a blockage in the nose.Take NOTE! FIGURE18.4 The nurse checks the newborn's identication 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 479either erythromycin or tetracycline ophthalmic ointment (Drug Guide 18.1). Vitamin K Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, promotes blood clottingby increasing the synthesis of prothrombin by the liver. Adeciency of this vitamin would delay clotting and mightlead to hemorrhage. Generally, the bacteria of the intestine produce vita- min K in adequate quantities. However, the newborn'sbowel is sterile, so vitamin K is not produced in the intes-tine until after microorganisms are introduced, such aswith the rst feeding. Usually it takes about a week for thenewborn to produce enough vitamin K to prevent vita-min K deciency bleeding (Wasee, 2006). The efficacy of vitamin K in preventing early vita- min K de ciency bleeding is rmly established and has been the standard of care since the AAP recommended itin the early 1960s. They recommend that vitamin K be ad-ministered to all newborns soon after birth in a single intra-muscular dose of 0.5 to 1 mg (AAP, 2007) (Fig. 18.5).They suggest that additional research is needed to validatethe efcacy and safety of oral forms of vitamin K, whichhave been used in many parts of the world but currentlyare not recommended in the United States. Eye Prophylaxis All newborns in the United States, whether deliveredvaginally or by cesarean birth, must receive an instilla-tion of a prophylactic agent in their eyes within an houror two of birth. This is mandated in all 50 states to pre-480 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN vent ophthalmia neonatorum , isa hyperacute purulent conjunctivitis occurring during therst 10 days of life. It is usually contracted during birthwhen the baby comes in contact with infected vaginal dis-charge of the mother (CDC, 2007). Most often both eye-lids become swollen and red with purulent discharge. Prophylactic agents that are currently recommended include erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment or tetra-cycline 1% ophthalmic ointment in a single application.Silver nitrate solution was formerly used but has little ef-cacy in preventing chlamydial eye disease (CDC, 2007). Regardless of which agent is used, instillation should be done as soon as possible after birth (Fig. 18.6).

Be alert for chemical conjunctivitis for 1-2 days. Wear gloves, and open eyes by placing thumb and nger above and below the eye. Gently squeeze the tube or ampoule to apply medication into the conjunctival sac from the inner canthus to the outer canthus of each eye. Do not touch the tip to the eye. Close the eye to make sure the medication permeates. Wipe off excess ointment after 1 minute. FIGURE18.5 The nurse administers vitamin K IM to the newborn.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 480Maintaining Thermoregulation Newborns have trouble regulating their temperature, espe- cially during the rst few hours after birth (see Chap. 17 fora complete discussion). Therefore, maintaining body tem-perature is crucial. Assess body temperature frequently during the im- mediate newborn period. The baby's temperature shouldbe taken every 30 minutes for the rst 2 hours or until thetemperature has stabilized, and then every 8 hours untildischarge (AAP, 2007). Commonly a thermistor probe (automatic sensor) is attached to the newborn to record body temperature ona monitoring device. The probe is taped to the newborn'sabdomen, usually in the right upper quadrant, which al-lows for position changes without having to readjust theprobe. The other end of the thermistor probe is insertedinto the radiant heat control panel. Temperature param-eters are set on an alarm system connected to the heatpanel that will sound if the newborn's temperature fallsout of the set range. Check the probe connection period-instillation is delayed to allow visualization and bonding, the nursery staff should make sure the agent is adminis-tered when the newborn reaches the nursery for observa-tion and assessment. Inform all parents about the eye treatment, including why it is recommended, what problems may arise if thetreatment is not given, and possible adverse effects of thetreatment.CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 481 ically to make sure that it remains secure. Remember the potential for heat loss in newborns, and perform all nurs-ing interventions in a way that minimizes heat loss andprevents hypothermia. Axillary temperatures can also be used to assess the newborn's body temperature. At one time, rectal ther-mometers were routinely used to monitor body temper-ature, but their use is no longer recommended becauseof the risk of traumatizing the rectal lining (Blackburn,2007). A newborn's temperature typically (97.7 \u00b0to 99.7 \u00b0F) (Kenner & Nursing interventions to help maintain body temper- ature include: Dry the newborn immediately after birth to prevent heat loss through evaporation. Wrap the baby in warmed blankets to reduce heat loss via convection. Use a warmed cover on the scale to weigh the unclothed newborn. Warm stethoscopes and hands before examining the baby or providing care. Avoid placing newborns in drafts or near air vents to prevent heat loss through convection. Delay the initial bath until the baby's temperature has stabilized to prevent heat loss through evaporation. Avoid placing cribs near cold outer walls to prevent heat loss through radiation. Put a cap on the newborn's head after it is thoroughly dried after birth. Place the newborn under a temperature-controlled radiant warmer (Fig. 18.7). Nursing Management During the Early Newborn Period The early newborn period is a time of great adjustment for both the mother and the newborn, both of whom areadapting to many physiologic and psychological changes.In the past, mothers and newborns remained in thehealth care facility while these dramatic changes weretaking place, with nurses and doctors readily available. However, today shorter hospital stays are the norm, andnew mothers can easily be overwhelmed by having to gothrough all of these changes in such a short time: thewoman gives birth, experiences marked physiologic andpsychological changes, and must adapt to her newbornand learn the skills needed to care for herself and the baby,all within 24 to 48 hours. The nurse's role is to assist the mother and her new- born through this dramatic transition period. The newbornneeds continued health assessment, and the mother needsto be taught to care for the new baby. At discharge, the newmother may panic and feel insecure about her role as pri-mary caretaker. Nurses play a major role in promoting thenewborn's transition by providing ongoing assessment and FIGURE18.6 The nurse administers eye prophylaxis. Parents have the right to refuse this treat- ment, but if they received adequate teaching about the treatment and understand its importance, theyusually will consent to it.Take NOTE! 11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 481care and in promoting the woman's condence by serving as a role model and teaching about proper newborn care. Assessment The newborn requires ongoing assessment after leavingthe birthing area to ensure that his or her transition to ex-trauterine life is progressing without problems. The nurseuses the data gathered during the initial assessment as abaseline for comparison. Perinatal History Pertinent maternal and fetal data are vital to formulate aplan of care for the mother and her newborn. Historicalinformation is obtained from the medical record and frominterviewing the mother. Review the maternal history be-cause it provides pertinent information, such as the pres-ence of certain risk factors that could affect the newborn.Keep in mind that a comprehensive maternal history maynot be available, especially if the mother has had limitedor no prenatal care. Historical information usually includes the following: Mother's name, medical record number, blood type, serology result, rubella and hepatitis status, and historyof substance abuse Other maternal tests that are relevant to the newborn and care, such as HIV and group B streptococcusstatus Intrapartum maternal antibiotic therapy (type, dose, and duration) Maternal illness that can affect the pregnancy, evidence of chorioamnionitis, maternal use of medications suchas steroids Prenatal care, including timing of rst visit and sub- sequent visits482 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Risk for blood group incompatibility, including Rh status and blood type Fetal distress or any nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns during labor Known inherited conditions such as sickle cell anemia and phenylketonuria (PKU) Birthweights of previous live-born children, along with identication of any newborn problems Social history, including tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use History of depression or domestic violence Cultural factors, including primary language and educational level Pregnancy complications associated with abnormal fetal growth, fetal anomalies, or abnormal results fromtests of fetal well-being Information on the progress of labor, birth, labor complications, duration of ruptured membranes,and presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid Medications given during labor, at birth, and immedi- ately after birth Time and method of delivery, including presentation and the use of forceps or a vacuum extractor Status of the newborn at birth, including Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, the need for suctioning, weight,gestational age, vital signs, and umbilical cord status Medications administered to the newborn Postbirth maternal information, including placental ndings, positive cultures, and presence of fever Newborn Physical Examination The initial newborn physical examination, which maydemonstrate subtle differences related to the newborn'sage, is carried out within the rst 24 hours after birth. Forexample, a newborn who is 30 minutes old has not yet A B FIGURE18.7 Maintaining thermoregulation. ( A) Radiant warmer. ( B) Isolette.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 482completed the normal transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life, and thus variability may exist in vitalsigns and in respiratory, neurologic, gastrointestinal, skin,and cardiovascular systems. Therefore, a comprehensiveexamination should be delayed until after the newbornhas completed the transition. In a quiet newborn, begin the examination with the least invasive and noxious elements of the examination(auscultation of heart and lungs). Then examine the areasmost likely to irritate the newborn (e.g., examining the hipsand eliciting the Moro reflex). A general visual assessmentprovides an enormous amount of information about thewell-being of a newborn. Initial observation gives an im-pression of a healthy (stable) versus an ill newborn and aterm versus a preterm newborn. A typical physical examination of a newborn includes a general survey of skin color, posture, state of alertness,head size, overall behavioral state, respiratory status, gen-der, and any obvious congenital anomalies. Check theoverall appearance for anything unusual. Then completethe examination in a systematic fashion. Remember Kelly, who called the home health nurse and said her newborn son \"looks like a canary\"? What additionalinformation is needed about the baby? What might be causinghis yellow color? Anthropometric Measurements Shortly after birth, after the gender of the child is revealed, most parents want to know the \"vital statistics\" of theirnewborn\u2014length and weight\u2014to report to their familyand friends. Additional measurements, including headand chest circumference, are also taken and recorded. Ab-dominal measurements are not routinely obtained unlessthere is a suspicion of pathology that causes abdominaldistention. The newborn's progress from that point onwill be validated based on these early measurements. Thesemeasurements will be compared with future serial meas-urements to determine growth patterns, which are plottedon growth charts to evaluate normalcy. Therefore, accu-racy is key. Length The average length of most newborns is 50 cm (20 in),but it can range from 45 to 55 cm (18 to 22 in). Measurelength with the unclothed newborn lying on a warmedblanket placed on a flat surface with the knees held in anextended position. Then run a tape measure down thelength of the newborn\u2014from the head to the soles of thefeet\u2014and record this measurement in the newborn'srecord (see Fig. 18.1). Weight At birth the average newborn weighs 3,400 g (7.5 lb), butnormal birthweights can range from 2,500 to 4,000 g (5 lb,8 oz to 8 lb, 14 oz). Newborns are weighed immediatelyafter birth and then daily. Newborns usually lose up toCHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 483 10% of their birthweight within the rst few days of life, but regain it in approximately 10 days. Newborns areweighed on admission to the nursery or are taken to a dig-ital scale to be weighed and returned to the mother's room. First, balance the scale if it is not balanced. Place a warmed protective cloth or paper as a barrier on the scaleto prevent heat loss by conduction; recalibrate the scale tozero after applying the barrier. Next, place the unclothednewborn in the center of the scale. Keep a hand above thenewborn for safety (see Fig. 18.2). Weight is affected by racial origin, maternal age, size of the parents, maternal nutrition, and placental perfusion(Lawrence, 2006). Weight should be correlated with gesta-tional age. A newborn who weighs more than normal mightbe LGA or an infant of a diabetic mother (IDM); a new-born who weighs less than normal might be SGA or pre-term or might have a genetic syndrome. It is important toidentify the cause for the deviation in size and to monitorthe newborn for complications common to that etiology. Head Circumference The average newborn head circumference is 32 to 38 cm(13 to 15 in). Measure the circumference at the head'swidest diameter (the occipitofrontal circumference). Wrapa flexible or paper measuring tape snugly around the new-born's head and record the measurement (Fig. 18.8A). The head circumference should be approximately one fourth of the newborn's length (Lawrence, 2006). Asmall head might indicate microcephaly caused by rubella,toxoplasmosis, or SGA status; an enlarged head mightindicate hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pres-sure. Both need to be documented and reported for fur-ther investigation. Chest Circumference The average chest circumference is 30 to 36 cm (12 to14 in). It is generally equal to or about 2 to 3 cm lessthan the head circumference (Burns et al., 2009). Placea flexible or paper tape measure around the unclothed newborn's chest at the nipple line without pulling it taut(see Fig. 18.8B). Head circumference may need to be remeasured at a later time if the shape of the head is altered from birth.Take NOTE! The head and chest circumferences are usually equal by about 1 year of age.Take NOTE! 11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 483Vital Signs In the newborn, temperature, pulse, and respirations are monitored frequently and compared with baseline dataobtained immediately after birth. Generally, vital signs(excluding blood pressure) are taken: On admission to the nursery or in the LDR room after the parents are allowed to hold and bond with thenewborn Once every 30 minutes until the newborn has been stable for 2 hours Then once every 4 to 8 hours until discharge (AAP, 2007) Blood pressure is not routinely assessed in a normal newborn unless the baby's clinical condition warrants it.This schedule can change depending on the baby's healthstatus. Obtain a newborn's temperature by placing an elec- tronic temperature probe in the midaxillary area or bymonitoring the electronic thermistor probe that has beentaped to the abdominal skin (applied when the newbornwas placed under a radiant heat source). Monitor the newborn's temperature hourly for changes until it stabilizes. On average, a newborn's tem-perature is 36.5 perature is higher, adjust the environment, such asremoving some clothing or blankets. If the temperature islower, check the radiant warmer setting or add a warmedblanket. Report any abnormalities to the primary healthcare provider if simple adjustments to the environmentdo not change the baby's temperature.484 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Obtain an apical pulse by placing the stethoscope over the fourth intercostal space on the chest. Listen for a fullminute, noting rate, rhythm, and abnormal sounds such asmurmurs. In the typical newborn, the heart rate is 120 to160 bpm, with wide fluctuations with activity and sleep.Sinus arrhythmia is a normal nding. Murmurs detectedduring the newborn period do not necessarily indicate con-genital heart disease, but they need to be assessed fre-quently over the next several months to see if they persist. Also palpate the apical, femoral, and brachial pulses for presence and equality (Fig. 18.9). Report any abnor-malities to the primary health care provider for evaluation. Assess respirations by observing the rise and fall of the chest for 1 full minute. Respirations should be symmetric,slightly irregular, shallow, and unlabored at a rate of 30 to60 breaths/minute. The newborn's respirations are pre-dominantly diaphragmatic, synchronous withabdominal movements. Also auscultate breath sounds.Note any abnormalities, such as tachypnea, bradypnea,grunting, gasping, periods of apnea lasting longer than20 seconds, asymmetry or decreased chest expansion,abnormal breath sounds (rhonchi, crackles), or sternalretractions. Some variations might exist early after birth,but if the abnormal pattern persists, notify the primaryhealth care provider. Skin Observe the overall appearance of the skin, including color,texture, turgor, and integrity. The newborn's skin shouldbe smooth and flexible, and the color should be consistentwith genetic background. AB FIGURE18.8 (A) Measuring head circumference. ( B) Measuring chest circumference.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 484Skin Condition and Color Check skin turgor by pinching a small area of skin overthe chest or abdomen and note how quickly it returns toits original position. In a well-hydrated newborn, the skinshould return to its normal position immediately. Skinthat remains \"tented\" after being pinched indicates de-hydration. A small amount of lanugo (ne downy hair)may be observed over the shoulders and on the sides ofthe face and upper back. There may be some crackingand peeling of the skin. The skin should be warm to thetouch and intact. The newborn's skin often appears blotchy or mottled, especially in the extremities. Persistent cyanosis of ngers,hands, toes, and feet with mottled blue or red discolorationand coldness is called acrocyanosis . It may be seen in newborns during the rst few weeks of life in response toexposure to cold. Acrocyanosis is normal and intermittent. Newborn Skin Variations While assessing the skin, note any rashes, ecchymoses orpetechiae, nevi, or dark pigmentation. Skin lesions can becongenital or transient; they may be a result of infectionor may result from the mode of birth. If any are present,observe the anatomic location, arrangement, type, andcolor. Bruising may result from the use of devices such asa vacuum extractor during delivery. Petechiae may be theresult of pressure on the skin during the birth process.Forceps marks may be observed over the cheeks and ears.A small puncture mark may be seen if internal fetal scalpelectrode monitoring was used during labor. Common skin variations include vernix caseosa, stork bites or salmon patches, milia, sign, nevus flammeus, and nevus vas-culosus (Fig. NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 485 Vernix caseosa is a thick white substance that pro- tects the skin of the fetus. It is formed by secretions fromthe fetus's oil glands and is found during the rst 2 or 3 daysafter birth in body creases and the hair. It does not need tobe removed because it will be absorbed into the skin. Stork bites or salmon patches are supercial vascu- lar areas found on the nape of the neck, on the eyelids,and between the eyes and upper lip (see Fig. 18.10A).The name comes from the marks on the back of the neckwhere, as myth goes, a stork may have picked up thebaby. They are caused by a concentration of immatureblood vessels and are most visible when the newborn iscrying. They are considered a normal variant, and mostfade and disappear completely within the rst year. Milia are unopened sebaceous glands frequently found on a newborn's nose. They may also appear on thechin and forehead (see Fig. 18.10B). They form from oilglands and disappear on their own within 2 to 4 weeks.When they occur in a newborn's mouth and gums, they aretermed Epstein's pearls . They occur in approximately 60% of newborns (AAP, 2007b). Mongolian spots are blue or purple splotches that appear on the lower back and buttocks of newborns (seeFig. 18.10C). They tend to occur in African-American,Asian, and Indian newborns but can occur in dark-skinnednewborns of all races. The spots are caused by a concen-tration of pigmented cells and usually disappear withinthe rst 4 years of life (Kliegman et al., 2007). Erythema toxicum (newborn rash) is a benign, id- iopathic, generalized, transient rash that occurs in up to70% of all newborns during the rst week of life. It con-sists of small papules or pustules on the skin resemblingflea bites. The rash is common on the face, chest, andback (see Fig. 18.10D). One of the chief characteristics A B C FIGURE18.9 Assessing the newborn's vital signs. ( A) Assessing the apical pulse. ( pulse.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 485of this rash is its lack of pattern. It is caused by the new- born's eosinophils reacting to the environment as the im-mune system matures (AAP, 2007b). It does not requireany treatment and disappears in a few days. Harlequin sign refers to the dilation of blood ves- sels on only one side of the body, giving the newborn theappearance of wearing a clown suit. It gives a distinctmidline demarcation, which is described as pale on thenondependent side and red on the opposite, dependent486 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN side. It results from immature autoregulation of blood flow and is commonly seen in low-birthweight newbornswhen there is a positional change (Dillon, 2007). It is tran-sient, lasting as long as 20 minutes, and no interventionis needed. Nevus flammeus , also called a port wine stain, com- monly appears on the newborn's face or other body areas (see Fig. 18.10E). It is a capillary angioma located di-rectly below the dermis. It is flat with sharp demarcations A B C D E F FIGURE18.10 Common skin variations. ( A) Stork bite. ( B) Milia. ( Page 486and is purple-red. This skin lesion is made up of mature capillaries that are congested and dilated. It ranges in sizefrom a few millimeters to large, occasionally involving asmuch as half the body surface. Although it does not growin area or size, it is permanent and will not fade. Portwine stains may be associated with structural malforma-tions, bony or muscular overgrowth, and certain cancers.Recent studies have noted an association between portwine birthmarks and childhood cancer, so newborns withthese lesions should be monitored with periodic eye ex-aminations, neurologic imaging, and extremity measure-ments (Johnson et al., 2007). Pulsed dye laser surgeryhas been used to remove larger lesions with some success(AAP, 2007b). Nevus vasculosus , also called a is a benign capillary hemangiomain the dermal and subdermal layers. It is raised, rough,dark red, and sharply demarcated (see Fig. 18.10F). It iscommonly found in the head region within a few weeksafter birth and can increase in size or number. Commonlyseen in premature infants weighing less than 1,500 g(Kenner & Lott, 2007), these hemangiomas tend to re-solve by age 3 without any treatment. Head Head size varies with age, gender, and ethnicity and hasa general correlation with body size. Inspect a newborn'shead from all angles. The head should appear symmetricand round. As many as 90% of the congenital malforma-tions present at birth are visible on the head and neck, socareful assessment is very important (AAP, 2007a). The newborn has two fontanels at the juncture of the cranial bones. The anterior fontanel is diamond-shapedand closes by 18 to 24 months. Typically it measures 4 to6 cm at the largest diameter (bone to bone). The poste-rior one is triangular, smaller than the anterior fontanel(usually ngertip size or 0.5 to 1 cm), and closes by 6 to12 weeks. Palpate both fontanels, which should be soft,flat, and open. Then palpate the skull. It should feel smoothand fused, except at the area of the fontanels. Also assessthe size of the head and the anterior and posterior fontanels,and compare them with appropriate standards. Variations in Head Size and Appearance During inspection and palpation, be alert for commonvariations that may cause asymmetry. These include caputsuccedaneum, cephalhematoma, and molding. Molding is the elongated shaping of the fetal head to accommodate passage through the birth canal (Fig. 18.11).It occurs with a vaginal birth from a vertex position inwhich elongation of the fetal head occurs with prominence of the occiput and overriding sagittal suture line. It typicallyresolves within a week after birth without intervention. Caput succedaneum describes localized edema on the scalp that occurs from the pressure of the birth process. It is commonly observed after prolonged labor. Clinically,CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 487 it appears as a poorly demarcated soft tissue swelling that crosses suture lines. Pitting edema and overlying petechiaeand ecchymosis are noted (Fig. 18.12A). The swelling willgradually dissipate in about 3 days without any treatment.Newborns who were delivered via vacuum extraction usu-ally have a caput in the area where the cup was used. Cephalhematoma is a localized effusion of blood beneath the periosteum of the skull. This condition is dueto disruption of the vessels during birth. It occurs afterprolonged labor and use of obstetric interventions suchas low forceps or vacuum extraction. The clinical a well-demarcated, often fluctuant swelling withno overlying skin swelling does notcross suture lines and is rmer to the touch than an edem- atous area (see Fig. 18.12B). Cephalhematoma usuallyappears on the second or third day after birth and dis-appears within weeks or months (Simonson et al., 2007). Common Abnormalities in Head or Fontanel Size Common abnormalities in head or fontanel size that mayindicate a problem include: Microcephaly\u2014a head circumference more than 2 stan- dard deviations below average or less than 10% of nor- mal parameters for gestational age, caused by failureof brain development (Cohen, 2007). It can be famil-ial, with autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance,and it may be associated with infections (cytomegalo-virus) and syndromes such as trisomy 13 and 18, andfetal alcohol syndrome (Kenner & Lott, 2007). FIGURE18.11 Molding in a newborn's head.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 487 Macrocephaly\u2014a head circumference more than 90% of normal, typically related to hydrocephalus (Dillon,2007). It is often familial (with autosomal dominantinheritance) and can be either an isolated anomaly ora manifestation of other anomalies, including hydro-cephalus and skeletal disorders (achondroplasia). Large fontanels\u2014more than 6 cm in the anterior di- ameter bone to bone or more than a 1-cm diameter posterior fontanel; possibly associated with mal-nutrition, hydrocephaly, hypothyroidism,trisomies and 21, and various as osteogenesis imperfecta Small or closed fontanels\u2014smaller-than-normal birth; associated with microcephaly or prematuresynostosis (union of two bones by osseous material)(Blackburn, 2007) Face Observe the newborn's face for fullness and symmetry.The face should have full cheeks and should be symmet-ric when the baby is resting and crying. If forceps wereused during birth, the newborn may have bruising andreddened areas over both cheeks and parietal bones sec-ondary to the pressure of the forceps blades. Reassure theparents that this resolves without treatment, and pointout improvement each day. Problems with the face can also involve facial nerve paralysis caused by trauma from the use of forceps. Paral-ysis is usually apparent on the rst or second day of life.Typically, the newborn will demonstrate asymmetry of theface with the inability to close the eye and move the lips onthe affected side. Newborns with facial nerve paralysishave difculty making a seal around the nipple, and con-488 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN sequently milk or formula drools from the paralyzed side of the mouth. Most facial nerve palsies resolve sponta-neously within days, although full recovery may requireweeks to months. Attempt to determine the cause fromthe newborn's history. Nose Inspect the nose for size, symmetry, position, and lesions.The newborn's nose is small and narrow. The nose shouldhave a midline placement, patent nares, and an intact sep-tum. The nostrils should be of equal size and should bepatent. A slight mucus discharge may be present, but thereshould be no actual drainage. The newborn is a preferentialnose breather and will use sneezing to clear the nose ifneeded. The newborn can smell after the nasal passages are cleared of amniotic fluid and mucus (AAP, 2007a). Mouth Inspect the newborn's mouth, lips, and interior struc-tures. The lips should be intact with symmetric movementand positioned in the midline; there should not be any le-sions. Inspect the lips for pink color, moisture, and crack-ing. The lips should encircle the examiner's nger to forma vacuum. Variations involving the lip might include cleftupper lip (separation extending up to the nose) or thinupper lip associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Assess the inside of the mouth for alignment of the mandible, intact soft and hard palate, sucking pads insidethe cheeks, a midline uvula, a free-moving tongue, andworking gag, swallow, and sucking reflexes. The mucousmembranes lining the oral cavity should be pink and moist,with minimal saliva present. Normal variations might include Epstein's pearls (small, white epidermal cysts on the gums palate Caput succedaneum involves the collection of serous fluid and often crosses the suture line. ( B) Cephalhematoma involves the collection of blood and does not cross the suture line.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 488that disappear in weeks), erupted precocious teeth that may need to be removed to prevent aspiration, and thrush(white plaque inside the mouth caused by exposure toCandida albicans during birth), which cannot be wiped away with a cotton-tipped applicator. Eyes Inspect the external eye structures, including the eyelids,lashes, conjunctiva, sclera, iris, and pupils, for position,color, size, and movement. There may be marked edemaof the eyelids and subconjunctival hemorrhages due topressure during birth. The eyes should be clear and sym-metrically placed. Test the blink reflex by bringing an ob-ject close to the eye; the newborn should respond quicklyby blinking. Also test the newborn's pupillary reflex: pupilsshould be round, and reactive to light bilaterally.Assess the newborn's gaze: he or she should be able to trackobjects to the midline. Movement may be uncoordinatedduring the rst few weeks of life. Many newborns have tran-sient strabismus (deviation or wandering of eyes independ-ently) and searching nystagmus (involuntary repetitive eyemovement), which is caused by immature muscular con-trol. These are normal for the rst 3 to 6 months of age. Examine the internal eye structures. A red reflex (lu- minous red appearance seen on the retina) should be seenbilaterally on retinoscopy. The red reflex normally showsno dullness or irregularities. Chemical conjunctivitis commonly occurs within 24 hours of instillation of eye prophylaxis after birth.There is lid edema with sterile discharge from both eyes.Usually it resolves within 48 hours without treatment. Ears Inspect the ears for size, shape, skin condition, placement,amount of cartilage, and patency of the auditory canal.The ears should be soft and pliable and should recoilquickly and easily when folded and released. Ears shouldbe aligned with the outer canthi of the eyes. Low-set earsare characteristic of many syndromes and genetic abnor-malities, such as trisomy 13 and 18, and internal organabnormalities involving the renal system. An otoscopic examination is not typically done be- cause the newborn's ear canals are lled with amnioticfluid and vernix caseosa, which would make visualizationof the tympanic membrane difcult. Newborn hearing screening is required by law in most states (discussed later in the chapter). Hearing loss is themost common birth defect in the United States: One in1,000 newborns is profoundly deaf and 2 to 3 in 1,000 have partial hearing loss (Wrightson, 2007). Delays in iden- tication and intervention may affect the child 's cognitive, verbal, behavioral, and emotional development. Screening at birth has reduced the age at which newborns with hear-ing loss are identied and has improved early interventionrates dramatically (AAP, 2007b). Prior to universal new-born screening, children were usually older than 2 yearsCHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 489 before signicant congenital hearing loss was detected; by this time it had already affected their speech and lan-guage skills (USPSTF, 2006). Causes of hearing loss can be conductive, sensori- neural, or central. Risk factors for congenital hearing lossinclude cytomegalovirus infection and preterm birth ne-cessitating a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. To assess for hearing ability generally, observe the newborn's response to noises and conversations. The new-born typically turns toward these noises and startles withloud ones. Neck Inspect the newborn's neck for movement and ability tosupport the head. The newborn's neck will appear almostnonexistent because it is so short. Creases are usuallynoted. The neck should move freely in all directions andshould be capable of holding the head in a midline posi-tion. The newborn should have enough head control tobe able to hold it up briefly without support. Report anydeviations such as restricted neck movement or absenceof head control. Also inspect the clavicles, which should be straight and intact. The clavicles are the bones mostly commonly bro-ken in infants, especially large ones. In most cases, the frac-tured clavicle is asymptomatic, but decreased or absentmovement and pain or tenderness on movement of the armon the affected side may be noted (Kenner & Lott, 2007).Treatment involves immobilization and minimizing pain. Chest Inspect the newborn's chest for size, shape, and symme-try. The newborn's chest should be round, symmetric,and 2 to 3 cm smaller than the head circumference. Thexiphoid process may be prominent at birth, but it usuallybecomes less apparent when adipose tissue accumulates.Nipples may be engorged and may secrete a white dis-charge. This discharge, which occurs in both boys andgirls, is a result of exposure to high levels of maternal estro-gen while in utero. This enlargement and milky dis charge usually dissipates within a few weeks. Some newborns mayhave extra nipples, called supernumerary nipples. They aretypically small, raised, pigmented areas vertical to the mainnipple line, 5 to 6 cm below the normal nipple (AAP,2007a). They tend to be familial and do not contain glan-dular tissue. Reassure parents that these extra small nip-ples are harmless. The newborn chest is usually barrel-shaped with equal anteroposterior and lateral diameters, and symmetric.Auscultate the lungs bilaterally for equal breath sounds.Normal breath sounds should be heard, with little differ-ence between inspiration and expiration. Fine crackles canbe heard on inspiration soon after birth as a result of clear-ing amniotic fluid from the lungs. Diminished breathsounds might indicate atelectasis, effusion, or poor respi-ratory effort (Dillon, 2007).11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 489Listen to the heart when the newborn is quiet or sleep- ing. S1 and S2 heart sounds are accentuated at birth. The point of maximal impulse (PMI) is a lateral to midclavic-ular line located at the fourth intercostal space. A displacedPMI may indicate tension pneumothorax or cardiomegaly.Murmurs are often heard and are usually be nign, but if present after the rst 12 hours of life should be evaluatedto rule out a cardiac disorder (Kliegman et al., 2007). Abdomen Inspect the abdomen for shape and movement. Typicallythe newborn's abdomen is protuberant but not distended.This contour is a result of the immaturity of the abdom-inal muscles. Abdominal movements are synchronouswith respirations because newborns are, at times, abdom-inal breathers. Auscultate bowel sounds in all four quadrants and then palpate the abdomen for consistency, masses, and tender-ness. Perform auscultation and palpation systematicallyin a clockwise fashion until all four quadrants have beenassessed. Palpate gently to feel the liver, the kidneys, and any masses. The liver is normally palpable 1 to 3 cm belowthe costal margin in the midclavicular line. The kidneysare 1 to 2 cm above and to both sides of the umbilicus.Normal ndings would include bowel sounds in all fourquadrants and no masses or tenderness on palpation. Ab-sent or hyperactive bowel sounds might indicate an intes-tinal obstruction. Abdominal distention might indicateascites, obstruction, infection, masses, or an enlarged ab-dominal organ (Cohen, 2007). Inspect the umbilical cord area for the correct amount of blood vessels (two arteries and one vein). The umbili-cal vein is larger than the two umbilical arteries. Evidenceof only a single umbilical artery is associated with renaland gastrointestinal anomalies. Also inspect the umbilicalarea for signs of bleeding, infection, granuloma, or ab-normal communication with the intra-abdominal organs(Walsh, 2007). Genitalia Inspect the penis and scrotum in the male. In the circum-cised male newborn, the glans should be smooth, with the meatus centered at the tip of the penis. It will appearreddened until it heals. For the uncircumcised male, theforeskin should cover the glans. Check the position of theurinary meatus: it should be in the midline at the glanstip. If it is on the ventral surface of the penis, hypospadiasis present; if it is on the dorsal surface of the penis, it istermed epispadias. In either case, circumcision should beavoided until further evaluation. Inspect the scrotum for size, symmetry, color, presence of rugae, and location of testes. The scrotum usually ap-pears relatively large and should be pink in white neonatesand dark brown in neonates of color. Rugae should be wellformed and should cover the scrotal sac. There should notbe bulging, edema, or discoloration (Fig. 18.13A).490 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Palpate the scrotum for evidence of the testes, which should be in the scrotal sac. The testes should feel rmand smooth and should be of equal size on both sides ofthe scrotal sac in the term newborn. Undescended palpated in the inguinal canalin they can be unilateral or bilateral. Ifthe testes are not palpable within the scrotal sac, furtherinvestigation is needed. In the female newborn, inspect the external genitalia. The urethral meatus is located below the clitoris in themidline (Dillon, 2007). In contrast to the male genitalia,the female genitalia will be engorged: the the labia minora. The clitoris is large and thehymen is thick. These findings are due to the maternalhormones estrogen and progesterone (see Fig. 18.13B). Avaginal discharge composed of mucus mixed with bloodmay also be present during the rst few weeks of life. Thisdischarge, called pseudomenstruation , requires no treat- ment. Explain this phenomenon to the parents. Variations in female newborns may include a labial bulge, which might indicate an inguinal hernia; B FIGURE18.13 Newborn genitalia. ( A) Male genitalia. Note the darkened color of the scrotum. ( B) Female genitalia.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 490Inspect the anus in both male and female newborns for position and patency. Passage of meconium indicatespatency. If meconium is not passed, a lubricated rectalthermometer can be inserted or a digital examination canbe performed to determine patency. Abnormal ndingswould include anal ssures or stulas and no meconiumpassed within 24 hours after birth. Extremities and Back Inspect the newborn's upper extremities for appearanceand movement. Inspect the hands for shape, number,and position of fingers and presence of palmar creases.The newborn's arms and hands should be symmetric andshould move through range of motion without hesitation.Observe for spontaneous movement of the extremities.Each hand should have five digits. Note any extra digits(polydactyly) or fusing of two or more digits (syndactyly).Most newborns have three palmar creases on the hand.A single palmar crease, called a simian line, is frequentlyassociated with Down syndrome.CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 491 A brachial plexus injury can occur during a difficult birth involving shoulder dystocia. Erb's palsy is an injuryresulting from damage to the upper plexus during laborand birth. The affected arm hangs limp alongside thebody, and the affected shoulder and arm are adducted,extended, and internally rotated with a pronated wrist. TheMoro reflex is absent on the affected side in brachial palsy.Complete recovery may take 3 to 6 months (Adegbehingbeet al., 2007). Assess the lower extremities in the same manner. They should of equal length, with symmetric skin folds. Inspectthe feet for clubfoot (a turning-inward position), which issecondary to intrauterine positioning. This may be posi-tional or structural. Perform the Ortolani and Barlow ma-neuvers to identify congenital hip dislocation, commonlytermed developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Nurs-ing Procedure 18.1 highlights the steps for performingthese maneuvers. Inspect the back. The spine should appear straight and flat and should be easily flexed when the baby is heldin a prone position. Observe for the presence of a tuft of Nursing Procedure 18.1 PERFORMING ORTOLANI AND BARLOW MANEUVERS Purpose: To Detect Congenital Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip Ortolani Maneuver 1. Place the newborn in the supine position and flex the hips and knees to 90 degrees at the hip. 2. Grasp the inner aspect of the thighs and abduct the hips (usually to approximately 180 degrees) while applyingupward pressure. 3. Listen for any sounds during the maneuver. There should be no \"cluck\" or \"click\" heard when the legs are abducted.Such a sound indicates the femoral head hitting theacetabulum as the head re-enters the area. This suggestsdevelopmental hip dysplasia.2. Feel for the femoral head slipping out of the acetabulum; also listen for a click (Dillon, 2007).Barlow Maneuver 1. With the newborn still lying supine and grasping the inner aspect of the thighs (as just mentioned), adduct thethighs while applying outward and downward pressureto the thighs.

These abnormal ndings should be doc-umented and reported to the primary health care provider. Table 18.3 summarizes the newborn assessment. Neurologic Status Assess the newborn's state of alertness, posture, muscletone, and reflexes. Newborn Alertness, Posture, and Muscle Tone The newborn should be alert and not persistently lethar-gic. The normal posture is hips abducted and partiallyflexed, with knees flexed. Arms are adducted and flexedat the elbow. Fists are often clenched, with ngers cover-ing the thumb.492 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN To assess for muscle tone, support the newborn with one hand under the chest. Observe how the neck muscleshold the head. The neck extensors should be able to holdthe head in line briefly. There should be only slight headlag when pulling the newborn from a supine position to asitting one. Newborn Reflexes Assess the newborn's reflexes to evaluate neurologic func-tion and development. Absent or abnormal reflexes in anewborn, persistence of a reflex past the age when the re-flex is normally lost, or return of an infantile reflex in anolder child or adult may indicate neurologic pathology(Table 18.4).

The ngers also spread to form a C.The newborn initially appears startled and then relaxes toa normal resting position (see Fig. 18.14B). Assess the stepping reflex by holding the newborn upright and inclined forward with the soles of the feettouching a flat surface. The baby should make a steppingmotion or walking, alternating flexion and extension withthe soles of the feet (see Fig. 18.14C). The tonic neck reflex resembles the stance of a fencer and is often called the fencing reflex. Test this reflex byhaving the newborn lie on the back. Turn the baby's headto one side. The arm toward which the baby is facingshould extend straight away from the body with the handpartially open, whereas the arm on the side away from theface is flexed and the st is clenched tightly. Reversing thedirection to which the face is turned reverses the position(see Fig. 18.14D). Elicit the rooting reflex by stroking the newborn's cheek. The newborn should turn toward the side that wasstroked and should begin to make sucking movements(see Fig. 18.14E). The Babinski reflex should be present at birth and disappears at approximately 1 year of age. It is elicited bystroking the lateral sole of the newborn's foot from theheel toward and across the ball of the foot. The toes shouldfan out. A diminished response indicates a neurologicproblem and needs follow-up (see Fig. 18.14F). The newborn exhibits two grasp reflexes: palmar grasp and plantar grasp. Elicit the palmar grasp reflex byplacing a nger on the newborn's open palm. The baby'shand will close around the nger. Attempting to removethe nger causes the grip to tighten.

Spinal reflexes tested include truncal incurvation (Galant reflex) andanocutaneous reflex (anal wink). The sucking reflex is elicited by gently stimulating the newborn's lips by touching them. The newborn willtypically open the mouth and begin a sucking motion.Placing a gloved nger in the newborn's mouth will alsoelicit a sucking motion (Fig. 18.14A). The Moro reflex, also called the embrace reflex, oc- curs when the neonate is startled. To elicit this reflex,place the newborn on his or her back. Support the upperbody weight of the supine newborn by the arms, using alifting motion, without lifting the newborn off the sur-face. Then release the arms suddenly.

The plantar grasp is similar to the palmar grasp. Place a nger just below the newborn's toes. The toes typicallycurl over the nger (see Fig. 18.14H). Blinking, sneezing, gagging, and coughing are all pro- tective reflexes and are elicited when an object or light isbrought close to the eye (blinking), something irritating isswallowed or a bulb syringe is used for suctioning (gag-ging and coughing), or an irritant is brought close to thenose (sneezing). The truncal incurvation reflex (Galant reflex) is pres- ent at birth and disappears in a few days to 4 weeks. Withthe newborn in a prone position or held in ventral sus-pension, apply rm pressure and run a nger down eitherside of the spine. This stroking will cause the pelvis to flextoward the stimulated side. This indicates T2-S1 inner-vation. Lack of response indicates a neurologic or spinalcord problem. The anocutaneous reflex (anal wink) is elicited by stimulating the perianal skin close to the anus. The ex-ternal sphincter (Kenner &Lott, 2007). Nursing Interventions Developing condence to care for their newborn is chal-lenging for most couples. It takes time and patience anda great deal of instruction provided by the nurse. \"Show-ing and telling\" parents about their newborn and all theprocedures (e.g., feeding, bathing, changing, handling)involved in daily care are key nursing interventions. Providing General Newborn Care Generally, newborn care involves bathing and hygiene,diaper care, cord care, circumcision care, use of appro-priate clothing, environmental safety measures, and pre-CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 495 vention of infection. Nurses should teach these skills to parents and should serve as role models for appropriateand consistent interaction with newborns. Demonstrat-ing respect for the newborn and family helps foster a pos-itive atmosphere to promote the newborn's growth anddevelopment. Bathing and Hygiene Immediately after birth, drying the newborn and remov-ing blood may minimize the risk of infection caused byhepatitis B, herpesvirus, and HIV, but the specic bene-ts of this practice remain unclear. Until the newborn hasbeen thoroughly bathed, standard precautions should beused when handling the newborn. Newborns are bathed primarily for aesthetic reasons, and bathing is postponed until thermal and cardiorespi-ratory stability is ensured. Traditional reasons why nursesbathe the newborn are so they can conduct a physical as-sessment, reduce the effect of hypothermia, and allow themother to rest (Cohen, 2007). However, recent researchsuggests that nurses do not need to give the newborn aninitial bath to reduce heat loss; rather, the parents couldbe given this opportunity, supported by nurses. A studyfound that the amount of heat loss was similar in new-borns bathed by parents versus newborns who were bathed by nurses (Walsh, 2007). Wear gloves, because of potential exposure to ma- ternal blood on the newborn, and perform the bathquickly, drying the baby thoroughly to prevent heat lossby evaporation. Move from the \"cleanest\" area (the eyes)to the most soiled area (the diaper area) to prevent cross-contamination. Use plain warm water on the face and eyes, adding a mild soap (e.g., Dove) to cleanse the remainder of thebody. Instruct the parents to wash the face and neck gentlyafter each feeding to prevent rashes and to prevent theodor that can develop when milk accumulates in the neckcreases. G H FIGURE18.14 (continued) (G) Palmar grasp. ( H) Plantar grasp.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 495Wash the hair using running water so that the scalp can be thoroughly rinsed. A mild shampoo or soap can beused. Wash both fontanel areas. Frequently parents avoidthese \"soft spots\" because they fear that they will \"hurt thebaby's brain\" if they rub too hard. Reassure parents thatthere is a strong membrane providing protection. Urgethe parents to clean and rinse these areas well. If the an-terior fontanel is not rinsed well after shampooing, cradlecap (dry flakes on the scalp) can develop. In Figure 18.15,the nurse is showing the father how to bathe his newborn. After bathing, place the newborn under the radiant warmer and wrap him or her securely in blankets to pre-vent chilling. Check the baby's temperature within an hourto make sure it is within normal limits. If it is low, place thenewborn under a radiant heat source again. The literature suggests that tub bathing for the rst bath, as opposed to sponge bathing, can be done withoutsignicantly lowering the newborn's temperature or in-creasing rates of cord infection in healthy term newborns(AAP, 2007c). After the initial bath, the newborn may not receive another full one during the stay in the birthing unit. Thediaper area will be cleansed at each diaper change, andany milk spilled will be cleaned. Clear water and a mildsoap are appropriate to cleanse the diaper area. The use oflotions, baby oil, and powders is not encouraged becauseoils and lotions can lead to skin irritation and can causerashes. Powders should not be used because they can beinhaled, causing respiratory distress. If the parents wantto use oils and lotions, have them apply a small amountonto their hand rst, away from the newborn; this warmsthe lotion. Then the parents should apply the lotion or oilsparingly. Instruct parents that a bath two or three times weekly is sufcient for the rst year; more frequent bathing maydry the skin. Parents should not fully immerse the new-born into water until the umbilical cord area is healed\u2014up to 2 weeks after birth. Encourage parents to give the496 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN infant a sponge bath until the umbilical cord falls off and the navel area is healed completely. If the newborn hasbeen circumcised, advise parents to wait until that area hasalso healed (usually 1 to 2 weeks). Until then, clean thepenis with mild soap and water and apply a small amountof Vaseline to the tip to prevent the diaper from adheringto the penis. Instruct parents to apply the diaper looselyand place the newly circumcised male infant on his side orback to prevent pressure and irritation on the penis. Encourage the parents to gather all items needed be- fore starting the bath: a soft, clean washcloth; two cottonballs to clean the eyes; mild, unscented soap and shampoo;towels or blankets; a tub or basin with warm water; a cleandiaper; and a change of clothes. Other guidelines forbathing newborns are given in Teaching Guidelines 18.1. Elimination and Diaper Area Care Newborn elimination patterns are highly individualized.Usually the urine is light amber in color. Soaking 6 to12 diapers a day indicates adequate hydration. Stools can FIGURE18.15 The nurse demonstrates bathing a newborn while the father watches.TEACHING GUIDELINES 18.1 Bathing a Newborn Select a warm room with a flat surface at a comfort- able working height. Before the bath, gather all supplies needed so theywill be within reach. Never leave the newborn alone or unattended atany time during the bath. Undress the newborn down to shirt and diaper. Always support the newborn's head and neck whenmoving or positioning him or her. Place a blanket or towel underneath the newbornfor warmth and comfort. In this order, progressing from the cleanest to thedirtiest areas: Wipe eyes with plain water, using either cottonballs or a washcloth. Wipe from the inner cornerof the eyes to the outer with separate wipes. Wash the rest of the face, including ears, withplain water. Using baby shampoo, gently wash the hair andrinse with water. Pay special attention to body creases, and drythoroughly. Wash extremities, trunk, and back. Wash, rinse,dry, cover. Wash diaper area last, using soap and water, anddry; observe for rash. Put on a clean diaper and clean clothes after the bath. 11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 496change in color, texture, and frequency without signaling a problem. Meconium is passed for the rst 48 hours afterbirth; the stools appear thick, tarry, sticky, and dark green.Transitional stools (thin, brown to green, less sticky thanmeconium) typically appear by day 3 after initiation offeeding. The stool characteristics after transitional stooldepend on whether the newborn is breast-fed or bottle-fed. Breast-fed newborns typically pass mustard-colored,soft stool with seedy consistency; formula-fed newbornspass yellow to brown, formed stool with a pasty consis-tency. As long as the newborn seems content, is eatingnormally, and shows no signs of illness, minor changes inbowel movements should not be a concern. The newborn needs to be checked frequently to see whether a diaper change is needed, especially after feed-ing. Adhere to standard precautions when providing dia-per area care. Instruct parents to keep the top edge of thediaper below the umbilical cord area to prevent irritationand to allow air to help dry the cord. Meconium can be difcult to remove from the skin. Use plain water or special cleansing wipes if necessary toclean the area. Teach parents how to clean the diaper areaproperly and how to prevent skin irritation. Encouragethem to avoid products such as powder and fragranceditems, which could be irritating. Discuss the pros and cons of using cloth diapers versus disposable diapers so that the parents can make informeddecisions. Regardless of the type of diapers used, up to10 diapers a day, or about 70 a week, will be needed. Additional information about diapering might include: Before diapering, make sure all supplies are within reach, including clean diaper, cleaning agent or wipes,and ointment. Lay the newborn on a changing table and remove the dirty diaper. Use water and mild soap or wipes to gently wipe the genital area clean; wipe from front to back for girls toavoid urinary tract infections. Wash your hands thoroughly before and after changing diapers. While performing diaper area care, parents should observe the area closely for irritation or rash. Tips for pre-venting or healing a diaper rash include: Change diapers frequently, especially after bowel movements. Apply a \"barrier\" cream, such as A & D ointment, after cleaning with mild soap and water. Use dye- and fragrance-free detergents to wash cloth diapers. Avoid the use of plastic pants, because they tend to hold in moisture. Expose the newborn's bottom to air several times a day. Place the newborn's buttocks in warm water after he or she had a diaper on all night.CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 497 Cord Care The umbilical cord begins drying within hours after birth and is shriveled and blackened by the second or third day.Within 7 to 10 days, it sloughs off and the umbilicusheals. During this transition, frequent assessments of thearea are necessary to detect any bleeding or signs of in-fection. Cord bleeding is abnormal and may occur if thecord clamp is loosened. Any cord drainage is also abnor-mal and is generally caused by infection, which requiresimmediate treatment. To protect the cord area during each diaper change, apply the appropriate agent (e.g., triple dye, alcohol, or anantimicrobial agent), according to facility policy, to thecord stump to prevent any ascending infections. Single-use agents for cleaning are recommended to prevent cross-contamination with other newborns. Expect to removethe cord clamp approximately 24 hours after birth by usinga cord-cutting clamp. However, if the cord is still moist,keep the clamp in place and ensure a referral to homehealth care so that the home care nurse can remove itafter discharge. Always adhere to agency policies regard-ing cord care; changes in policy may be necessary basedon new research ndings. Many parents avoid contact with the cord site to make sure they don't \"bother\" it. Teach them how to care forthe cord site when they go home to prevent complications(Teaching Guidelines 18.2). Circumcision Care Circumcision is the surgical removal of all or part of the foreskin (prepuce) of the penis (AAP, 2007c). This hasbeen traditionally done for hygiene and medical reasonsand is the oldest known religious rite. In the Jewish faith,circumcision is a ritual that is performed by a mohel (or- dained circumciser) on the eighth day after birth if possi-ble. The circumcision is followed by a religious ceremonyduring which the newborn is named. There are three commonly used methods of circum- cision: the Gomco clamp, the Plastibell device, and theMogen clamp. During the circumcision procedure, partof the foreskin is removed by clamping and cutting witha scalpel (Gomco or Mogen clamp) or by using a Plas-tibell. The Plastibell is tted over the glans, and the ex-cess foreskin is pulled over the plastic ring. A suture istied around the rim to apply pressure to the blood ves-sels, creating hemostasis. The excess foreskin is cut away.The plastic rim remains in place until healing occurs. Advise parents that a rash that persists for more than 3 days may be fungal in origin and may require additional treatment. Encourage theparents to notify the health care provider.Take NOTE! 11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 497The plastic ring typically loosens and falls off in approx- imately 1 week (Kenner & Lott, 2007) (Fig. 18.16). The debate over routine newborn circumcision con- tinues in the United States. For many years, the purportedbenets and harms of circumcision have been debated inthe medical literature and society at large, with no clearconsensus to date. Despite the controversy, circumcisionis the most common surgical procedure performed onnewborns, and almost two thirds of American male new-borns are circumcised (Cunningham et al., 2005). A policy statement by the AAP indicates that new- born circumcision has potential disadvantages and risksas well as medical benets and advantages. Risks to thenewborn include infection, hemorrhage, skin dehiscence,adhesions, urethral stula, to the new-born include the following: Urinary tract infections are slightly less common in circumcised boys; however, rates are low in both cir-498 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN cumcised and uncircumcised boys and are easily treated without long-term sequelae. Sexually transmitted infections are less common in cir- cumcised males, but the risk is believed to be relatedmore to behavioral factors than to circumcision status.However, circumcised males have a 50% lower risk ofacquiring HIV infection (Ridings & Amaya, 2007). There appears to be a slightly lower rate of penile cancer in circumcised males; however, penile canceris rare and risk factors such as genital warts, infectionwith human papillomavirus (HPV), multiple sex part- ners, and cigarette smoking seem to play a much largerrole in causing penile cancer than circumcision status(Kliegman et al., 2007). The new AAP recommendations state that if parents decide to circumcise their newborn, pain relief must beprovided. Research has found that newborns circumcisedwithout analgesia experience pain and stress, indicated bychanges in heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation,and cortisol levels (Ridings & Amaya, 2007). Analgesicmethods may include cream (a topical mixture oflocal anesthetics), a dorsal penile block with bufferedlidocaine, acetaminophen, a sucrose pacier, and swad-dling (Cunningham et al., 2005). The AAP recommends that parents be given accurate and unbiased information about the risks and benets ofcircumcision. As with other newborn procedures, re-search continues. Nurses must keep informed about cur-rent medical research to allow parents to make informeddecisions. The absence of compelling medical evidencein favor of or against newborn circumcision makes in-formed consent of parents of paramount importance. Thecircumcision discussion inv olves cultural, religiou s, med- ical, and emotional considerations. Nurses may have dif-culty remaining unbiased and unemotional as they presentthe facts to parents. Circumcision is a very personal de-cision for parents, and the nurse's major responsibility isto inform the parents of the risks and benets of the pro-TEACHING GUIDELINES 18.2 Umbilical Cord Care Observe for bleeding, redness, drainage, or foul odor from the cord stump and report it to yournewborn's primary care provider immediately. Avoid tub baths until the cord has fallen off and thearea has healed. Expose the cord stump to the air as much as possi-ble throughout the day. Fold diapers below the level of the cord to preventcontamination of the site and to promote air-dryingof the cord. Observe the cord stump, which will change colorfrom yellow to brown to black. This is normal. Never pull the cord or attempt to loosen it; it willfall off naturally. A C B FIGURE18.16 Circumcision. ( A) Before the procedure. ( B) Clamp applied and foreskin removed. ( C) Appearance after circumcision.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 498cedure and to address concerns so that the parents can reach a fully informed decision. Immediately after circumcision, the tip of the penis is usually covered with petroleum jelly-coated gauze tokeep the wound from sticking to the diaper. Continuedcare of this site includes: Assess for bleeding every 30 minutes for at least 2 hours. Document the rst voiding to evaluate for urinary obstruction or edema. Squeeze soapy water over the area daily and then rinse with warm water. Pat dry. Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly with every diaper change if the Plastibell was used; clean withmild soap and water if other techniques were used. Fasten the diaper loosely over the penis and avoiding placing the newborn on his abdomen to prevent friction. If a Plastibell has been used, it will fall off by itself in about a week. Inform parents of this and advise them notto pull it off sooner. Also instruct the parents to checkdaily for any foul-smelling drainage, bleeding, or unusualswelling. If the newborn is uncircumcised, wash the penis with mild soap and water after each diaper change and do notforce the foreskin back; it will retract normally over time. Safety Newborns are completely dependent on those aroundthem to ensure their safety. Their safety must be en-sured while in the health care facility and after they aredischarged. Parental education is key, especially as thenewborn grows and develops and begins to respond toand explore his or her surroundings (Teaching Guide-lines 18.3). Environmental Safety People who enter a health care facility for treatment ex-pect to be safe there until they return home, but ensuringa safe environment can be a daunting challenge to a healthcare facility. Consider this scenario: A woman dressed in nurse's clothing entered the hospital room of a new mother soonafter she had given birth. This \"nurse\" told the mothershe needed to take her newborn to the nursery to havehim weighed. Sometime later, a staff nurse making herroutine rounds realized something was wrong when sheCHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 499 saw that the newborn's bassinet in the mother's room was empty and the mother was sound asleep in her bed. Thestaff nurse called security immediately because she sus-pected that a newborn abduction had taken place. This is a typical abduction scenario that is repeated many times throughout the United States each year. Ininfant abduction , someone who is not a family member takes a child less than 1 year old (Cohen, 2007). Infantabductions are traumatic for the parents, the community,and the health care facility. The facility may also face hugenancial liability if a lawsuit is led by the parents. Abductions typically occur during the day and are usu- ally carried out by women who are not criminally sophisti-cated. Many of these women experienced a pregnancy lossin the past; they are often emotionally immature and com-pulsive, with low self-esteem. Most female abductors canplay the role of a hospital employee convincingly (Health-care Risk Management, 2007). Health care agencies are challenged to prevent infant abduction by instituting sound security practices and The decision to circumcise the male new- born is often a social one, with the strongest factor being whether the newborn's father is himselfcircumcised (AAP, 2007).Take NOTE! TEACHING GUIDELINES 18.3 General Newborn Safety Have emergency telephone numbers readily available, such as those for emergency medical assistance and the poison control center. Keep small or sharp objects out of reach to prevent them from being aspirated. Put safety plugs in wall sockets within the child'sreach to prevent electrocution. Do not leave the infant alone in any room without a portable intercom on. Always supervise the newborn in the tub: a new-born can drown in 2 inches of water. Make sure the crib or changing table is sturdy,without any loose hardware, and is painted withlead-free paint. Avoid placing the crib or changing table near blindsor curtain cords. Provide a smoke-free environment for all infants. Place all infants on their backs to sleep to preventsudden infant death syndrome. To prevent falls, do not leave the newborn alone onany elevated surface. Use sun shields on strollers and hats to avoid over-exposing the newborn to the sun. To prevent infection, thoroughly wash your handsbefore preparing formula. Thoroughly investigate any infant care facility before using it. Source: AAP, 2007b.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 499systems (AWHONN Lifelines, 2007). Such measures include the following: All newborns must be transported in cribs and not carried. Nurses must respond immediately to any security alarm that sounds on the unit. Newborns must never be unattended at any time, especially in hallways. All staff must wear appropriate identication at all times. Scrubs should not be worn by nursing staff on the postpartum unit. Personnel should be wary of visitors who do not seem to be visiting a specic mother. The electronic security system should be checked to make sure it works. Proper functioning and placement of any electronic sensors used on newborns should be ensured. Parents should be taught what infant abduction is; why infant security is important; the schedule of nursery, feeding, and visiting hours; rules about visitor access;the facility's security policies and procedures; whatparents can do to protect their infant in the hospital;which staff members are allowed to handle the new-born; and what a proper ID looks like. Providing a safe and secure environment is a shared responsibility of the facility, staff, and parents. Prevent-ing abductions requires everyone to learn and follow therules and policies. Car Safety Every state requires the use of car seats for infants and chil-dren, because motor vehicle accidents are still the leadingcause of unintentional injury and death in children underage 5 (AAP, 2007d). In more than half of these deaths, thechild was unrestrained. Despite evidence that the use of car seats can reduce the morbidity and mortality of motor vehicle crashes, par-ents who lack knowledge about them may underuse ormisuse them (AAP, 2007d). Make sure that both parentsunderstand the importance of safely transporting theirnewborn in a federally approved safety car seat every timethe infant rides in a car. Do not release any newborn un-less the parents have a car seat in place for their new-born's ride home (Fig. 18.17). If they cannot afford one,many community organizations will provide one for them.According to the AAP, no one car seat is considered to bethe \"safest\" or the \"best,\" but rather consistent and proper use is the key to preventing injuries and deaths. Instructparents in the following: Select a car seat that is appropriate for the child's size and weight. Use the car seat correctly, every time the child is in the car. Use rear-facing car seats for infants until they are at least 1 year old and weigh 20 lb.500 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Make sure the harness (most seats have a three- to ve-point harness) is in the slots at or below the shoulders. Infection Prevention The nurse plays a major role in preventing infection inthe newborn environment. Ways to control infection areas follows: Minimize exposure of newborns to organisms. Wash your hands before and after providing care, and insist that all personnel wash their hands beforehandling any newborn. Do not allow ill staff or visitors to visit or handle newborns. Monitoring the umbilical cord stump and circumcision site for signs of infection. Providing eye prophylaxis by instilling prescribed medication soon after birth. Educate parents about appropriate home measures that will prevent infections, such as practicing goodhand washing before and after diaper changes, keep-ing the newborn well hydrated, avoiding bringing the infant into crowds (which may expose him or her to colds and flu viruses), observing for earlysigns of infection (fever, vomiting, loss of appetite,lethargy, labored breathing, green watery stools,drainage from umbilical cord site or eyes), and keeping pediatrician appointments for routine immunizations. Promoting Sleep Although many parents feel their newborns need themevery minute of the day, babies actually need to sleep muchof the day initially. Usually newborns sleep up to 15 hoursdaily. They sleep for 2 to 4 hours at a time but do not sleepthrough the night because their stomach capacity is toosmall to go long periods without nourishment. FIGURE18.17 Newborn in a properly secured car seat.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 500Parents should place the newborn on his or her back to sleep. To prevent suffocation, all fluffy bedding, quilts,sheepskins, stuffed animals, and pillows should be re-moved from the crib. Parents should be informed that the practice of \"co- sleeping\" (sharing a bed) is not safe: for example, infantswho sleep in adult beds are up to 40 times more likely tosuffocate than those who sleep in cribs (Buswell & Spatz2007). Suffocation can occur when the infant gets entan-gled in bedding or caught under pillows, or slips betweenthe bed and the wall or the headboard and mattress. Theparent may accidentally roll against or on top of the baby.The safest place for a newborn to sleep is in a crib, with-out any movable objects close by. Teach parents to avoid other unsafe conditions, such as placing the newborn in the prone position, using a cribthat does not meet federal safety guidelines, allowing win-dow cords to hang loose and in close proximity to the crib,or setting the room temperature too high (can cause over-heating) (Adler, Hyderi, & Hamilton, 2006). Enhancing Bonding Encourage and enhance parent-newborn interaction by involving both parents with the baby and demonstratingappropriate nurturing behaviors: Say \"hello\" and introduce yourself to the newborn. Ask the parents permission to care for and hold their newborn. This helps parents to realize that they are responsible for their child and reminds nurses of their role. Show parents the power of a soothing voice to calm the newborn. Provide care to the newborn in the least stressful way. Demonstrate ways to wake the newborn up gently to feed better. Tell parents what you are doing, why you are doing it, and how they can duplicate what you are doing at home. Offer the opportunity for parents to perform care while you observe them. Support their efforts tosoothe the newborn throughout the care process. Help parents to interpret the communication cues the newborn uses. Point out the efforts the newborn is making to connect with the parents (e.g., alerting to the familiar voice,following the parents while they are speaking, quietingwhen held securely).CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 501 One of the most pleasurable aspects of newborn care is being close to them. Bonding begins soon after birthwhen parents cradle their newborn and gently stroke himor her with their ngers. Provide parents with opportuni-ties for \"skin-to-skin\" contact with the newborn, holdingthe baby against their own skin when feeding or cradling.Many newborns respond very positively to gentle massage.If necessary, recommend books and videos that cover thesubject. For newborns, crying is their only way to communicate that something is wrong. Try to nd out the reason why: Isthe diaper wet? Is the room too hot or too cold? Is the babyuncomfortable (e.g., diaper rash or tight clothing)? Suggestthe following ways in which parents can soothe an upsetnewborn: Try feeding or burping to relieve air or stomach gas. Lightly rub the newborn's back and speak softly to him or her. Gently sway side to side, or rock back and forth in a rocking chair. Talk with the newborn while making eye contact. Take the newborn for a walk in a stroller or carriage to get fresh air. Change the baby's position from back to side or vice versa. Try singing, reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or reading to the baby. Turn on a musical mobile above the newborn's head. Give more physical contact by walking, rocking, or patting the newborn. Swaddle the newborn to provide a sense of security and comfort. To do this: Spread out a receiving blanket, with one corner folded slightly. Lay the newborn face up with head at the folded corner. Wrap the left corner over the baby's body and tuck it beneath the baby. Bring the bottom corner over the baby's feet. Wrap the right corner around the baby, leaving only the head exposed. Assisting With Screening Tests Screening newborns for problems is important because some potentially life-threatening metabolic diseases maynot be obvious at birth. Newborn screening tests that arerequired in most states before discharge are used to checkfor certain genetic and inborn errors of metabolism andhearing. Early identication and initiation of treatmentcan prevent signicant complications and can minimizethe negative effects of untreated disease. Genetic and Inborn Errors of Metabolism Screening Although each state mandates which conditions must betested, the most common screening tests are for PKU,hypothyroidism, galactosemia, and sickle cell disease(Table 18.5). All newborns develop their own sleep patterns and cycles, but it may take several months before the newborn sleeps through the night.Take NOTE! 11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 501The trend toward early discharge of newborns can affect the timing of screening and the accuracy of sometest results. For example, the newborn needs to ingestenough breast milk or formula to elevate phenylalaninelevels for the screening test to identify PKU accurately,502 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN so newborn screening for PKU testing should not be per- formed before 24 hours of age. Screening tests for genetic and inborn errors of me- tabolism require a few drops of blood taken from thenewborn's heel (Fig. 18.18). These tests are usually per-PKU Congenital hypothyroidism Galactosemia Sickle cell anemiaClinical Picture/ Condition Description Effect If Not Treated Treatment Timing of Screening Autosomal reces- sive inherited deciency in to aminoacids and mayresult Absence of the en- zyme needed forthe conversion of the milk sugargalactose to inherited abnormality inhemoglobinstructure, mostcommonly odorto andmotor retardation,seizures, micro-cephaly, and Increased in borns with birth-weight <2,000 jaundice,mood eyesight,seizures, mental to thebrain, eyes, andliver, after birth;increased risk electrolytereplacement,pain screened for States;testing is done 24-48 hours after pro-tein feeding thy- roxin [T4] and TSH)is done betweendays 4 and 6 of life.

Newborns who are dis- charged before 24 hours of age need to have repeat testsdone within a week in an outpatient facility. Be aware of which conditions your state regularly screens for at birth to ensure that the parents are taughtabout the tests and the importance of early treatment. Alsobe familiar with the optimal time frame for screening andconditions that could affect the results. Ensure that a sat-isfactory specimen has been obtained at the appropriatetime and that circumstances that could cause false resultshave been minimized. Send out specimens and completedforms within 24 hours of collection to the appropriatelaboratory (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Hearing Screening Hearing loss is the most common birth disorder in theUnited States: approximately three to ve newborns outof every 1,000 have some degree of hearing loss. Unlikea physical deformity, hearing loss is not clinically detectableat birth and thus remains difficult to assess (Wrightson,2007). Factors associated with an increased risk of hear-ing loss include: Family history of childhood sensory hearing loss Congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus, rubella, toxoplasmosis, herpesCHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 503 Craniofacial anomalies involving the pinna or ear canal Low birthweight (less than 1,500 g) Postnatal infections such as bacterial meningitis Head trauma Hyperbilirubinemia requiring an exchange transfusion Exposure to ototoxic drugs, especially aminoglycosides Perinatal asphyxia (USPSTF, 2006) Delays in identication and intervention may affect the child's language development, academic performance, andcognitive development. Detection before 3 months greatlyimproves outcomes. Because of this, auditory screeningprograms for all newborns are recommended by the AAPand are mandated by law in over 30 states. Screening onlyinfants with risk factors is not enough, because as many as50% of infants born with hearing loss have no known riskfactors (AAP, 2007b). Early identication and interventioncan prevent severe psychosocial, educational, and languagedevelopment delays. The current goals of Healthy People 2010 (see the Healthy People 2010 display earlier in this chapter) are toscreen all infants by 1 month of age, conrm hearing losswith an audiologic examination by 3 months of age, andtreat with comprehensive early intervention services before6 months of age (USDHHS, Volume II, Objective 16-20). All newborns should be screened prior to discharge to ensure that any newborn with a hearing loss is not missed.Those with suspected hearing loss should be referred forfollow-up assessment (Box 18.1 discusses screening meth-ods). In addition, nurses should ensure that testing is ac-curate to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention servicesand to optimize the newborn's developmental potential. A B FIGURE18.18 Screening for PKU. ( A) Performing a heel stick. (B) Applying the blood specimen to the card for screening. BOX 18.1 Newborn Hearing Screening Methods A newborn's hearing can be screened in one of two ways: otoacoustic emission (OAE) or automated audi-tory brain stem response (ABR). In OAE, an earphoneis placed in the infant's ear canal and the sounds pro-duced by the newborn's inner ear are measured in re-sponse to certain tones or clicks presented through theearphone. Preset parameters in the equipment decidewhether the OAEs are sufcient for the newborn to passor whether a referral is necessary for further evaluation. In ABR, an earphone is placed in the ear canal or an earmuff is placed over the newborn's ear, and a soft,rapid tapping noise is presented. Electrodes placedaround the newborn's head, neck, and shoulders recordneural activity from the infant's brain stem in responseto the tapping noises. The ABR tests how well the earand the nerves leading to the brain work. Like OAEs,automated ABR screening is sensitive to more thanmild degrees of hearing loss, but a \"pass\" does notguarantee normal hearing. Source: AAP, 2007a.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 503Dealing With Common Concerns During the newborn period of transition, certain conditions can develop that require intervention. These conditions,although not typically life-threatening, can be a source ofanxiety for the parents. Common concerns include tran-sient tachypnea of the newborn, physiologic jaundice, andhypoglycemia. Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn Transient tachypnea of the newborn appears soon afterbirth. It is accompanied by retractions, expiratory grunt-ing, or cyanosis and is relieved by low-dose oxygen therapy.Mild or moderate respiratory distress typically is presentat birth or within 6 hours of birth. This condition usuallyresolves within 3 days. Transient tachypnea of the newborn occurs when the fetal liquid in the lungs is removed slowly or incompletely.This can be due to the lack of thoracic squeezing that oc-curs during a cesarean birth, or diminished respiratoryeffort if the mother received central nervous system de-pressant medication. Prolonged labor, macrosomia of thefetus, and maternal asthma also have been associated withthis condition (Asenjo, 2007). Nursing interventions include providing supportive care (giving oxygen, ensuring warmth, observing respira-tory status frequently, and allowing time for the pulmonarycapillaries and the lymphatics to remove the remainingfluid). The clinical course is relatively benign, but any new-born respiratory issue can be very frightening to the par-ents. Provide a thorough explanation and reassure themthat the condition will resolve over time.504 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Physiologic Jaundice Physiologic jaundice is demonstrating yellowish skin, mucous mem-branes, and sclera within the rst 3 days of life. In anygiven year, approximately 60% of the newborns in theUnited States will experience clinical jaundice (Desh-pande & Ramer, 2007). Jaundice is the visible manifesta-tion hyperbilirubinemia. It typically results from thedeposition of unconjugated bilirubin pigment in the skinand mucous membranes. Factors that contribute to the development of physio- logic jaundice in the newborn include an increased biliru-bin load because of relative polycythemia, a shortenederythrocyte life span (80 days compared with the adult120 days), and immature hepatic uptake and conjugationprocesses (Deshpande & Ramer, 2007). Normally the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and changes it to a formin which it can be excreted. As the red blood cell break-down continues at a fast pace, the newborn's liver cannotkeep up with bilirubin removal. Thus, bilirubin accumu-lates in the blood, causing a yellowish discoloration onthe skin. The AAP has recently released guidelines for the pre- vention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in new-borns. These include: Promotion and support of successful breast-feeding practices to make sure the newborn is well hydratedand stooling frequently to promote elimination ofbilirubin Completion of a systematic assessment before dis- charge for the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemiaPuig, T., Municio, A., & Med\u00e0, C. (2006). Universal neonatal hearing screening versus selective screening as part of the management of childhood deafness. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD003731. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003731.pub2Study The principal factors that determine how deafness affects a child's development are the degree of hearing impairmentand the age at which it is diagnosed. A number of factorsare thought to increase the risk of hearing impairment, suchas low birthweight, prematurity, and perinatal hypoxia andjaundice. The high incidence of deafness in children withoutrisk factors and the introduction of simple new screeningtests with high sensitivity and specificity have led manyprestigious bodies to recommend universal early detectionprograms for deafness rather than screening that targetshigh-risk groups. A study was performed to compare thelong-term effectiveness of a universal neonatal screeningand early treatment program for hearing impairment versusscreening and treatment of high-risk neonates only.Findings This review found no randomized trials that compared the long-term results of these screening programs. Controlledtrials and before-and-after studies are needed to addressthis issue. Nursing Implications Although additional research is needed, nurses should encourage all parents to have their newborns screened.The AAP recommends hearing screening for all newbornsso that early interventions can be provided to preventspeech, language, and cognitive development impairments.This information should be stressed during dischargeplanning activities and follow-up tests if warranted. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 18.1 Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening Versus Selective Screening as Part of the Management of Childhood Deafness11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 504 Early and focused follow-up based on the risk assessment When indicated, treatment of newborns with photo- therapy or exchange transfusion to prevent kernicterus(AAP, 2006b) Assess for jaundice in all newborns by pressing gently with a ngertip on the bridge of the nose, sternum, or fore-head. If jaundice is present, the blanched area will appearyellow before the capillary rell (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Measures that parents can take to reduce the risk of jaundice include exposing the newborn to natural sun-light for short periods of time throughout the day to helpoxidize the bilirubin deposits on the skin, provide breast-feeding on demand to promote elimination of bilirubinthrough urine and stooling, and avoiding glucose watersupplementation, which hinders elimination. If or when the levels of unconjugated serum biliru- bin increase and do not return to normal levels with increased hydration, phototherapy is used. The serumlevel of bilirubin at which phototherapy is initiated is amatter of clinical judgment by the physician, but it isoften begun when bilirubin levels reach 12 to 15 mg/dLin the first 48 hours of life in a term newborn (Arenson& Drake, 2007). Phototherapy involves exposing the newborn to ultraviolet light, which converts unconjugatedbilirubin into products that can be excreted through feces and urine.CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 505 of the skin as possible. Thus, the newborn must be naked and turned frequently to ensure maximum exposure ofthe skin. Several side effects of standard phototherapyhave been identied: frequent loose stools, increased in-sensible water loss, transient rash, and potential retinaldamage if the newborn's eyes are not covered sufciently. Recently, beroptic pads (Biliblanket or Bilivest) have been developed that can be wrapped around the newbornor on which the newborn can lie. The light is deliveredfrom a tungsten-halogen bulb through a beroptic cable and is emitted from the sides and ends of the bers insidea plastic pad (Cohen, 2006). These products work on thepremise that phototherapy can be improved by deliveringhigher-intensity therapeutic light to decrease bilirubinlevels. The pads do not produce appreciable heat like thebanks of lights or spotlights do, so insensible water loss isnot increased. Eye patches also are not needed; thus, par-ents can feed and hold their newborns continuously topromote bonding. When caring for newborns receiving phototherapy for jaundice, nurses must do the following: Closely monitor body temperature and fluid and electrolyte balance. Observe skin integrity (as a result of exposure to diarrhea and phototherapy lights). Provide eye protection to prevent corneal injury related to phototherapy exposure. Encourage parents to participate in their newborn's care to prevent parent-infant separation. See Chapter 24 for a more detailed discussion of hyperbilirubinemia. The home health nurse made a postpartum visit to Kelly to assess the situation. Kelly's son was slightly jaundiced whenthe home health nurse pressed gently over his sternum, butKelly said he was nursing better compared with the previous2 days. What home suggestions can the nurse make to Kellyto reduce the jaundice? What specic education aboutphysiologic jaundice is needed? Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia affects as many as 40% of all full-termnewborns (Kenner & Lott, 2007). It is dened as a bloodglucose level of less than 35 mg/dL or a plasma concen-tration of less than 40 mg/dL (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Innewborns, blood glucose levels fall to a low point duringthe rst few hours of life because the source of maternalglucose is removed when the placenta is expelled. Thisperiod of transition is usually smooth, but certain new-borns are at greater risk for hypoglycemia: infants of dia-betic mothers, preterm newborns, and andendocrine deciencies (Kliegman et al., 2007). Exposure of newborns to sunlight represents the rst documented use of phototherapy in the medical literature. Sister J. Ward, a charge nursein Essex, England, in 1956 recognized that whenjaundiced newborns were exposed to the sun they became less yellow. This observation changed the entiretreatment of jaundice in newborns (Maisels, 2006).Take NOTE! Phototherapy reduces levels breaking down unconjugated bilirubin into colorless com-pounds. These compounds can then be excreted in thebile. Phototherapy aims to curtail the increase in bilirubinblood levels, thereby preventing kernicterus, a conditionin which unconjugated bilirubin enters the brain. If nottreated, kernicterus can lead to brain damage and death. During the past several decades, phototherapy has generally been administered with either banks of fluores-cent lights or spotlights. Factors that determine the doseof phototherapy include spectrum of light emitted, irra-diance of light source, design of light unit, surface area ofnewborn exposed to the light, and distance of the new-born from the light source (Cohen, 2006). For photo-therapy to be effective, the rays must penetrate as much11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 505Most newborns experience transient hypoglycemia and are asymptomatic. The symptoms, when present, arenonspecic and include jitteriness, lethargy, cyanosis,apnea, seizures, high-pitched or weak cry, and poor feed-ing. If hypoglycemia is prolonged or is left untreated,serious, long-term adverse neurologic sequelae such aslearning disabilities and mental retardation can occur(Cohen, 2007). Subsequently, early diagnosis and appro-priate intervention are essential for all newborns. Nursing care of the hypoglycemic newborn includes monitoring for signs of hypoglycemia or identifying high-risk newborns prone to this disorder based on their peri-natal history, physical examination, body measurements,and gestational age. Check the blood glucose level of allnewborns within the rst few hours after birth and every4 hours thereafter. More frequent monitoring and earlyfeeding may be necessary for newborns considered to behigh risk. Prevent hypoglycemia in newborns at risk byinitiating early feedings with breast milk or formula. If hy-poglycemia persists despite feeding, notify the primaryhealth care provider for orders such as intravenous ther-apy with dextrose solutions. Anticipate hypoglycemia incertain high-risk newborns and begin assessments imme-diately on nursery admission. Promoting Nutrition Several physiologic changes dictate the type and method of feeding throughout the newborn's rst year. Some ofthese changes include the following: Stomach capacity is limited to about 90 mL at birth. The emptying time is short (2 to 3 hours) and peristalsisis rapid. Therefore, small, frequent feedings are neededat rst, with amounts progressively increasing withmaturity. The immune system is immature at birth, so the baby is at a high risk for food allergies during the rst 4 to 6 months of life. Introducing solid foods prior to thistime increases the risk of developing food allergies. Pancreatic enzymes and bile to assist in digestion of fat and starch are in limited supply until about 3 to 6 months of age. Infants cannot digest cereal prior to this time. The kidneys are immature and unable to concentrate urine until about 4 to 6 weeks of age. Excess proteinand mineral intake can place a strain on kidney func-tion and can lead to dehydration. Infants need to con-sume more water per unit of body weight than adultsdo as a result of their high body weight from water. Immature muscular control at birth changes over time to assist in the feeding process by improving head andneck control, hand-eye coordination, swallowing, andability to sit, grasp, and chew. At about 4 to 6 months,inborn reflexes disappear, head control develops, andthe infant can sit to be fed, making spoon-feeding pos-sible (Dudek, 2006).506 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Newborn Nutritional Needs As newborns grow, their energy and nutrient requirementschange to meet their body's changing needs. During in-fancy, energy, protein, vitamin, and mineral requirementsper pound of body weight are higher than at any other timeof life. These high levels are needed to fuel the rapid growthand development during this stage of life. Generally, aninfant's birthweight doubles in the rst 4 to 6 months oflife and triples within the rst year (Dillon, 2007). A newborn's caloric needs range from 80 to 120 cal/ kg body weight. For the first 3 months, the infant needs110 cal/ kg/day; this decreases to 100 cal/kg/day from 3 to 6 months (Begany & Mascarenhas, 2007). Breast milk andformulas contain approximately 20 cal/oz, so the caloricneeds of young infants can be met if several feedings aregiven throughout the day. Fluid requirements for the newborn and infant range from 100 to 150 mL/kg daily. This requirement can be metthrough breast or bottle feedings. Additional water supple-mentation is not necessary. Adequate carbohydrates, fats, protein, and vitamins are achieved through consumptionof breast milk or formula. The AAP recommends thatbottle-fed infants be given iron supplementation, becauseiron levels are low in all types of formula milk. This canbe achieved by giving iron-fortied formula from birth.The breast-fed infant draws on iron reserves for the rst6 months and then needs iron-rich foods or supplemen-tation added at 6 months of age. The AAP (2007c) alsohas recommended that all infants (breast- and bottle-fed)receive a daily supplement of vitamin D starting withinthe rst 2 months of life to prevent rickets and vitamin Ddeciency. It is also recommended that fluoride supple-mentation be given to infants not receiving fluoridatedwater after the age of 6 months (AAP, 2007c). Supporting the Choice of Feeding Method Parents typically decide about the method of feeding wellbefore the infant is born. Prenatal and childbirth classespresent information about breast-feeding versus bottlefeeding and allow the parents to make up their mindsabout which method is best for them. Various factors caninfluence their decision, including socioeconomic status,culture, employment, social support available, level ofeducation, range of care interventions provided duringpregnancy, childbirth, and the early postpartum period,and especially partner support (Pryor & Huggins, 2007).Nurses can provide evidence-based information to assistthe couple in making their decision. Regardless of whichmethod is chosen, the nurse needs to respect and supportthe couple. Feeding the Newborn The newborn can be fed at any time during the transitionperiod if assessments are normal and a desire is demon-strated. Before the newborn can be fed, determine his orher ability to suck and swallow. Clear any mucus in the11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:00 PM Page 506nares or mouth with a bulb syringe before initiating feed- ing. Auscultate bowel sounds, check for abdominal disten-tion, and inspect the anus for patency. If these parametersare within normal limits, newborn feeding may be started.Most newborns are on demand feeding schedules and areallowed to feed when they awaken. When they go home,mothers are encouraged to feed their newborns every 2 to4 hours during the day and only when the newborn awak-ens during the night for the rst few days after birth. Parents often have many questions about feeding. Generally, newborns should be fed on demand wheneverthey seem hungry. Most newborns will give clues abouttheir hunger status by crying, placing their ngers or stin their mouth, rooting around, and sucking. Newborns differ in their feeding needs and prefer- ences, but most breast-fed ones need to be fed every 2 to3 hours, nursing for 10 to 20 minutes on each breast. Thelength of feedings is up to the mother and newborn. En-courage the mother to respond to cues from her infantand not feed according to a standard or preset schedule. Formula-fed newborns usually feed every 3 to 4 hours, nishing a bottle in 30 minutes or less. Bottle-fed infantsconsume about 2 to 4 fluid ounces at rst and double theirintake within a few weeks of age (Begany & Mascarenhas,2007). If the newborn seems satised, wets 6 to 10 diapersdaily, produces several stools a day, sleeps well, and is gain-ing weight regularly, then he or she is probably receivingsufcient breast milk or formula. Newborns swallow air during feedings, which causes discomfort and fussiness. Parents can prevent this by burp-ing them frequently throughout the feeding. Tips aboutburping include: Hold the newborn upright with his or her head on the parent's shoulder (Fig. 18.19A). Support the head and neck while the parent gently pats or rubs the newborn's back (Fig.18.19B). Have the newborn sit on the parent's lap, while support- ing the baby's chest and head. Gently rub the newborn'sback with the other hand. Lay the newborn on the parent's lap with the baby's back facing up. Support the newborn's head in the crook of the parent's arm and gently pat or rub the back.CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 507 for the baby's emotional pleasure as his or her physical well-being. Encourage parents to maintain eye contact withthe newborn during the feeding, hold him or her comfort-ably close to them, and talk softly during the feeding topromote closeness and security. A It is the upright position, not the strength of the patting or rubbing, that allows the newborn to release air accumulated in the stomach.Take NOTE! Stress to parents that feeding time is more than an opportunity to get nutrients into their newborn; it is alsoa time for closeness and sharing. Feedings are as muchFIGURE18.19 The nurse demonstrates holding the newborn upright over the shoulder ( A) and sitting the newborn upright, supporting the neck and chin ( B). B11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 507Breast-Feeding There is consensus in the medical community that breast-feeding is optimal for all newborns. The AAP and theAmerican Dietetic Association recommend breast-feedingexclusively for the rst 6 months of life, continuing it inconjunction with other food at least until the newborn'srst birthday (AAP, 2007c). Box 18.2 highlights the ad-vantages of breast-feeding for the mother and newborn. Mothers should continue to breast-feed during mild illnesses such as colds or the flu. However, in the UnitedStates mothers with HIV are advised not to breast-feed. The composition of breast milk changes over time from colostrum, to transitional milk, and nally to maturemilk. Colostrum is a thick, yellowish substance secretedduring the rst few days after birth. It is high in protein,minerals, and fat-soluble vitamins. It is rich in immuno-globulins (IgA), which help protect the newborn's gastro-intestinal tract against infections. It is a natural laxativethat helps rid the intestinal tract of meconium quickly(Pryor & Huggins, 2007).508 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Transitional milk occurs between colostrum and ma- ture milk and contains all the nutrients in colostrum, butit is thinner and less yellow than colostrum. This transi-tional milk is replaced by true or mature milk around day10 after birth. Mature milk appears bluish and is not asthick as colostrum. It provides 20 cal/oz and contains: Protein\u2014Although the content is lower than formula, it is ideal to support growth and development for thenewborn. The majority of protein is whey, which iseasy to digest. Fat\u2014Approximately 58% of total calories are fat, but they are easy to digest. Essential fatty acid content ishigh, as is the level of cholesterol, which helps developenzyme systems capable of handling cholesterol laterin life. Carbohydrate\u2014Approximately 35% to 40% of total calories are in the form of lactose, which stimulatesthe growth of natural defense bacteria in the gastro-intestinal system and promotes calcium absorption. Water\u2014Water, the major nutrient in breast milk, makes up 85% to 95% of the total volume. Total milkvolume varies with the age of the infant and demand. Minerals\u2014Breast milk contains calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, and sodium, with trace amountsof iron, copper, and manganese. Iron absorption isabout 50%, compared with about 4% for iron-fortiedformulas. Vitamins\u2014All vitamins are present in breast milk; vitamin D is the lowest in amount. Debate about theneed for vitamin D supplementation is ongoing. Enzymes\u2014Lipase and amylase are found in breast milk to assist with digestion (Dudek, 2006). Breast-Feeding Assistance Breast-feeding can be initiated immediately after birth.If the newborn is healthy and stable, wipe the newbornfrom head to toe with a dry cloth and place him or herskin-to-skin on the mother's abdomen. Then cover thenewborn and mother with another warmed blanket tohold in the warmth. Immediate mother-newborn contacttakes advantage of the newborn's natural alertness aftera vaginal birth and fosters bonding. This immediate con-tact also reduces maternal bleeding and stabilizes thenewborn's temperature, blood glucose level, and respira-tory rate (AAP, 2007c). Left alone on the mother's abdomen, a healthy new- born scoots upward, pushing with the feet, pulling with thearms, and bobbing the head until nding and latching onto the mother's nipple. A newborn's sense of smell is highlydeveloped, which also helps in nding the nipple. As thenewborn moves to the nipple, the mother produces highlevels of oxytocin, which contracts the uterus, therebyminimizing bleeding. Oxytocin also causes the breasts torelease colostrum when the newborn sucks on the nipple.Colostrum is rich in antibodies and thus provides the new-born with her \"rst immunization\" against infection.BOX 18.2 Advantages of Breast-Feeding Advantages for the Newborn Contributes to the development of a strong immune system Stimulates growth of positive bacteria in digestive tract Reduces incidence of stomach upset, diarrhea, and colic Begins the immunization process at birth by providing passive immunity Promotes optimal mother-infant bonding Reduces risk of newborn constipation Promotes greater developmental gains in preterm infants (AAP, 2006a, 2006b) Provides easily tolerated and digestible formula that is sterile, at proper temperature, and readily availablewith no articial colorings, flavorings, or preservatives Is less likely to result in overfeeding, leading to obesity (AAP, 2006a, 2006b) Promotes better tooth and jaw development as a result of sucking hard Provides protection against food allergies Is associated with avoidance of type 1 diabetes and heart disease Advantages for the Mother Can facilitate postpartum weight loss Stimulates uterine contractions to control bleeding Promotes uterine involution as a result of release of oxytocin Lowers risk of breast cancer and osteoporosis Affords some protection against conception, although it is not a reliable contraceptive method (Pryor &Huggins, 2007)11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 508Keys to successful breast-feeding include: Initiating breast-feeding within the rst hour of life if the newborn is stable Following the newborn's feeding schedule\u20148 to 12 times in 24 hours Providing unrestricted periods of breast-feeding Offering no supplement unless medically indicated Having a lactation consultant observe a feeding session Avoiding articial nipples and paciers except during a painful procedure Feeding from both breasts over each 24-hour period Watching for indicators of sufcient intake from infant: Six to ten wet diapers daily Waking up hungry 8 to 12 times in 24 hours Acting content and falling asleep after feeding Keeping the newborn with the mother throughout the hospital stay Help position the newborn so that latching-on is ef- fective and is not painful for the mother. Placing pillowsor a folded blanket under the mother's head may help, orrolling her to one side and tucking the newborn next toher. Assess both the mother and newborn during this ini-tial session to determine needs for assistance and educa-tion. One tool used frequently in this assessment is theLATCH scoring tool (Table 18.6). The higher the score,the less nursing intervention is needed by the motherand baby. Breast-Feeding Positioning The mother and infant must be in comfortable positionsto ensure breast-feeding success. The four most commonpositions for breast-feeding are the football, cradle, across-CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 509 the-lap, and side-lying holds. Each mother, on experimen- tation, can decide which positions feel most comfortablefor her (Fig. 18.20). In the football hold, the mother holds the infant's back and shoulders in her palm and tucks the infant under herarm. Remind the mother to keep the infant's ear, shoulder,and hip in a straight line. The mother supports the breastwith her hand and brings it to the infant's lips to latch on.She continues to support the breast until the infant beginsto nurse. This position allows the mother to see the infant'smouth as she guides her infant to the nipple. This is a goodchoice for mothers who have had a cesarean birth becauseit avoids pressure on the incision. The cradling position is the one most commonly used. The mother holds the baby in the crook of her arm, withthe infant facing the mother. The mother supports thebreast with her opposite hand. In the across-the-lap position, the mother places a pillow across her lap, with the infant facing the mother.The mother supports the infant's back and shoulders withher palm and supports her breast from underneath. Afterthe infant is in position, the infant is pulled forward tolatch on. In the side-lying position, the mother lies on her side with a pillow supporting her back and another pillow sup-porting the newborn in the front. To start, the motherprops herself up on an elbow and supports the newbornwith that arm, while holding her breast with the oppositehand. Once nursing is started, the mother lies down in acomfortable position. To promote latching-on, instruct the mother to make a C or a V with her ngers. In the C hold, the mother placesher thumb well above the areola and the other four ngers L: Latch A: Audible swallowingT: type of nipple C: comfort of nipple H: hold (positioning)Parameters 0 Point 1 Point 2 Points Sleepy infant, no sustained latch achieved None Inverted (drawn inward into breast tissue) Engorged, cracked bleed- ing; severe discomfort Nurse must hold infant to breastMust hold nipple in infant's mouth to sustain latch andsuck; must stimulate infantto continue to suck A few observed with stimulation Flat (not protruding) Filling; reddened, small blis- ters or bruises; mild tomoderate positioning, then mothertakes overGrasps nipple; tongue down; rhythmic sucking Spontaneous and intermittent both <24 hours old and afterward Everted or protruding out after stimulation Soft, nontender No assistance needed by nurseTABLE 18.6 THELATCH S CORING PM Page 509below the areola and under the breast. In the V hold, the mother places her index nger above the areola and herother three ngers below the areola and under the breast.Either method can be used as long as the mother's hand iswell away from the nipple so the infant can latch on.510 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Breast-Feeding Education Breast-feeding is not an innate skill in human mothers. Al-most all women have the potential to breast-feed success-fully, but many fail because of inadequate knowledge.Nursing Care Plan 18.1 gives typical nursing diagnoses,outcomes, and interventions. For many mothers and new-borns, breast-feeding goes smoothly from the start, butfor others it is a struggle. Nurses can help throughout theexperience by demonstrating techniques and offering en-couragement and praise for success. Nurse should em-phasize that the key to successful breast-feeding is correctpositioning and latching-on. Teaching by nurses has been shown to have a signif- icant effect on both the ability to breast-feed successfullyand the duration of lactation (Dudek, 2006). During therst few breast-feeding sessions, mothers want to knowhow often they should be nursing, whether breast-feedingis going well, if the newborn is getting enough nourishment,and what problems may ensue and how to cope with them.Education for the breast-feeding mother is highlighted inTeaching Guidelines 18.4. Remember Kelly, who was concerned about jaundice in her newborn son? At her son's 2-week well-baby checkup at theclinic, his bilirubin level came back within normal limits. Kellystill felt he was not getting enough to eat and stated that shemight switch to formula-feeding her son. What informationcan the nurse present to promote and reinforce breast-feeding?Should the nurse make a referral to the lactation consultant? Breast Milk Storage and Expression If the breast-feeding mother becomes separated from thenewborn for any reason (e.g., work, travel, illness), sheneeds instruction on how to express and store milk safely.Expressing milk can be done manually (hand compres-sion of breast) or by using a breast pump. Manual or handpumps are inexpensive and can be used by mothers whooccasionally need an extra bottle if they are going out.Electric breast pumps are used for mothers who experi-ence a lengthy separation from their infants and need topump their breasts regularly (Fig. 18.21). To ensure the safety of expressed breast milk, instruct the mother in the following: Wash your hands before expressing milk or handling breast milk. Use clean containers to store expressed milk. Use sealed and chilled milk within 24 hours. Discard any milk that has been refrigerated more than 72 hours. Use any frozen expressed milk within 3 months. Do not use microwave ovens to warm chilled milk. Discard any used milk; never refreeze it. Store milk in quantities to be used for each feeding (2 to 4 oz). Thaw milk in warm water before using (AAP, 2007b). A B C FIGURE18.20 Breast-feeding positions.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 510CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 511 Nursing Care Plan 18.1 OVERVIEW OF THE MOTHER AND NEWBORN HAVING DIFFICULTY WITHBREAST-FEEDING Baby boy James, weight 7 lb, 4 oz, was born a few hours ago. His mother, Jane, is a 19-year-old gravida 1, para 1. His Apgar scores were 9 points at both 1 and 5 minutes. Labor and birth were unremarkable, and James was admitted to thenursery for assessment. After stabilization, James was brought to his mother, who had said she wished to breast-feed. The postpartum nurse assisted Jane with positioning and latching-on and left the room for a few minutes. On returning,Jane was upset, James was crying, and Jane stated she wanted a bottle of formula to feed him since she didn't have milkand her nipples hurt. Assessment reveals a young, inexperienced mother placed in an uncomfortable situation with limited knowledge of breast-feeding. Anxiety from the mother transferred to James, resulting in crying. The mother, apprehensive about breast-feeding, needs additional help. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Knowledge decit related to breast-feeding skills Outcome Identication and Evaluation Mother will demonstrate understanding of breast-feeding skills as evidenced by use of correct positioning and technique, and verbalization of appropriate information related to breast-feeding. Interventions: Providing Education Instruct mother on proper positioning for breast-feeding; suggest use of football hold, side-lying position, modied cradle, and across-the-lap position to ensure comfort and to promote ease in breast-feeding . Review breast anatomy and milk letdown reflex to enhance mother's understanding of lactation . Observe newborn's ability to suck and latch on to the nipple to assess whether newborn has adequate ability . Monitor sucking and newborn swallowing for several minutes to ensure adequate latching on and to assess intake . Reinforce nipple care with water and exposure to air to maintain nipple integrity . NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to breast-feeding ability and irritable, crying newborn Outcome Identication and Evaluation Mother will verbalize increased comfort with breast-feeding as evidenced by positive statements related to breast-feeding and verbalization of desire to continue to breast-feed newborn. Interventions: Reducing Anxiety Ensure that the environment is calm and soothing without distractions to promote maternal and newborn relaxation . Show mother correct latching-on technique to promote breast-feeding . Assist in calming newborn by holding and talking to ensure that the newborn is relaxed prior to latching on . Reassure mother she can be successful at breast-feeding to enhance her self-esteem and condence . Encourage frequent trials and attempts to enhance condence . Encourage the mother to verbalize her anxiety/fears to reduce anxiety . NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Pain related to breast-feeding and incorrect latching-on technique Outcome Identication and Evaluation Mother will experience a decrease in pain during breast-feeding as evidenced by statements of less nipple pain. Interventions: Reducing Pain Suggest several alternate positions for breast-feeding to increase comfort . Demonstrate how to break suction before removing infant from breast to minimize trauma to nipple . Inspect nipple area to promote early identication of trauma . Reinforce correct latching-on technique to prevent nipple trauma . Administer pain medication if indicated to relieve pain . Instruct about nipple care between feedings to maintain nipple .11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 511Common Breast-Feeding Concerns Breast-feeding problems such ascracked nipples, engorgement, or mastitis. Breast-feedingshould not be painful for the mother. If she has sore,cracked nipples, the rst step is to nd the cause. Incorrectpositioning or latching-on, removing the infant from thebreast without rst breaking the suction, or wearing a brathat is too tight can cause cracked or sore nipples. Crackednipples can increase the risk of mastitis because a break inthe skin may allow Staphylococcus aureus or other organ- isms to enter the body. Sore nipples usually are caused by improper infant attachment, which traumatizes the tissue. The nurseshould review techniques for proper positioning andlatching-on. Recommend the following to the mother: Use only water, not soap, to clean the nipples to prevent dryness.512 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN Express some milk before feeding to stimulate the milk ejection reflex. Avoid using breast pads with plastic liners, and change pads when they are wet. Wear a comfortable bra that is not too tight. Apply a few drops of breast milk to the nipples after feeding. Rotate positions when feeding the infant to promote complete breast emptying. Leave the nursing bra flaps down after feeding to allow nipples to air-dry. Inspect the nipples daily for redness or cracks (Arenson & Drake, 2007). To ease nipple pain and trauma, reinforce appropri- ate latching-on and remind the woman about the need tobreak the suction at the breast before removing the new-born from the breast. Additional measures may includeTEACHING GUIDELINES 18.4 Breast-Feeding Set aside a quiet place where you can be relaxed and won't be disturbed. Relaxation promotes milkletdown. Sit in a comfortable chair or rocking chair or lie ona bed. Try to make each feeding calm, quiet, andleisurely. Avoid distractions. Listen to soothing music and sip a nutritious drinkduring feedings. Initially, nurse the newborn every few hours tostimulate milk production. Remember that the supply of milk is equal to the demand\u2014the moresucking, the more milk. Watch for signals from the infant to indicate that he or she is hungry, such as: Nuzzling against the mother's breasts Demonstrating the rooting reflex by making sucking motions Placing st or hands in mouth to suck on Crying and squirming Smacking of the lips Stimulate the rooting reflex by touching the newborn's cheek to initiate sucking. Look for signs indicating that the newborn haslatched on correctly: wide-open mouth with thenipple and much of the areola in the mouth, lipsrolled outward, and tongue over lower gum, visiblejaw movement drawing milk out, rhythmic suckingwith an audible swallowing (soft \"ka\" or \"ah\"sound indicates the infant is swallowing milk). Hold the newborn closely, facing the breast, withthe newborn's ear, shoulder, and hip in direct alignment.Nurse the infant on demand, not on a rigid schedule. Feed every 2 to 3 hours within a 24-hourperiod for a total of 8 to 12 feedings. Alternate the breast you offer rst; identify with asafety pin on bra. Vary your position for each feeding to empty breastsand reduce soreness. Look for signs that the newborn is getting enoughmilk: At least six wet diapers and two to ve loose yellow stools daily Steady weight gain after the rst week of age Pale-yellow urine, not deep yellow or orange Sleeping well, yet looks alert and healthy whenawake (AAP, 2007a) Wake up the newborn if he or she has nursed lessthan 5 minutes by unwrapping him or her. Before removing the baby from the breast, breakthe infant's suction by inserting a nger. Burp the infant to release air when changing breastsand at the end of the breast-feeding session. Avoid supplemental formula feedings to prevent\"nipple confusion\" (Pryor & Huggins, 2007) Do not take drugs or medications unless approvedby the health care provider. Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeinated drinks becausethey pass through milk. Do not smoke while breast-feeding; it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Always wash your hands before expressing or handling milk to store. Wear nursing bras and clothes that are easy to undo. 11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 512applying cold compresses over the area and massaging breast milk onto the nipple after feeding. Engorgement may occur as the milk comes in around day 3 or 4 after birth of the newborn. Explain to the motherthat engorgement, though uncomfortable, is self-limitedand will resolve as the newborn continues to nurse. Themother should continue to nurse during engorgement toavoid a plugged milk duct, which could lead to mastitis.Provide the following tips for relieving engorgement: Take warm to hot showers to encourage milk release. Express some milk manually before breast-feeding. Wear a supportive nursing bra 24 hours a day to provide support. Feed the newborn in a variety of positions\u2014sitting up and then lying down. Massage the breasts from under the axillary area down toward the nipple. Increase the frequency of feedings. Apply warm compresses to the breasts prior to nursing. Stay relaxed while breast-feeding. Use a breast pump if nursing or manual expression is not effective. Remember that this condition is temporary and resolves quickly. Mastitis, or inflammation of the breast, causes flu- like symptoms, chills, fever, and malaise. These symptomsmay occur before the development of soreness, aching,swelling, and redness in the breast (usually the upper outerquadrant). This condition usually occurs in just one breastwhen a milk duct becomes blocked, causing inflamma-tion, or through a cracked or damaged nipple, allowingbacteria to infect a portion of the breast. Treatment con-CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 513 sists of rest, warm compresses, antibiotics, breast support, and continued breast-feeding (the infection will not passinto the breast milk). Explain to the mother that it is im-portant to keep the milk flowing in the infected breast,whether it is through nursing or manual expression orwith a breast pump. Formula Feeding Despite the general acknowledgment that breast-feedingis the most desirable means of feeding infants, about 40%of mothers choose formula feeding and need educationabout this procedure. Formula-fed infants grow morerapidly than breast-fed infants not only in weight but alsoin length (Begany & Mascarenhas, 2007). Formula feeding requires more than just opening, pouring, and feeding. Parents need information about thetypes of formula available, preparation and storage of for-mula, equipment, feeding positions, and the amount tofeed their newborn. The mother also needs to know howto prevent lactation (see Chap. 16 for more information). Commercially prepared formulas are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are man-ufactured by Meade Johnson (Enfamil) or Ross Labora-tories (Similac) in the United States. Normal full-terminfants usually receive conventional cow's milk-basedformula, but this decision is made by the health careprovider. If the infant shows signs of a reaction or lactoseintolerance, a switch to another formula type is recom-mended. The general recommendation is for all infants toreceive iron-fortied formula until the age of 1 year. Thelatest generation of infant formulas includes some forti-cation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonicacid (ARA), two natural components of breast milk. Re-searchers have found that formulas with DHA and ARAcan enhance visual and cognitive development in children(Lawson, 2007). Commercial formulas come in three forms: powder, concentrate, and easy to feed or ready to use. All are sim-ilar in terms of nutritional content but differ in expense.Powdered formula is the least expensive, with concentratedformula the next most expensive. Both must be mixedwith water before using. Ready-to-feed formula is the mostexpensive; it can be opened and poured into a bottle andfed directly to the infant. Parents need information about the equipment needed for formula feeding. Basic supplies are 4 to 6 4-oz bottles, 8 to 10 8-oz bottles, 8 to 10 nipple units, a bottle brush,and a nipple brush. A key area of instruction is assessingfor flow of formula through the nipple and checking forany nipple damage. When the bottle is lled and turnedupside down, the flow from the nipple should be approx-imately one drop per second. If the parents are using bot-tles with disposable bags, instruct them to make sure theyhave a tight-tting nipple to prevent leaks. Frequent ob-servation of the flow rate from the nipple and the condi-tion of the nipple will prevent choking and aspiration FIGURE18.21 Hand-held breast pump.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 513Any formula left in the bottle after feeding should also be discarded, because the infant's saliva has been mixed with it.Take NOTE! associated with too fast a rate of delivery. Ask the parentsto ll a bottle with formula and then turn it upside downand observe the rate at which the formula drips from thebottle. If it is too fast (more than one drop/second), thenthe nipple should be replaced. Correct formula preparation is critical to the new- born's health and development. Mistakes in dilution mayresult if the parents do not understand how to prepare theformula or make measurement errors. The safety of thewater supply should be considered. If well water is used,parents should sterilize the water by boiling it or shoulduse bottled water. Many health care providers still recom-mend that all water used in formula preparation be broughtto a rolling boil for 1 to 2 minutes and should be cooled toroom temperature before use. Opened cans of ready-made or concentrated formula should be covered and refrigerated after being preparedfor the day (24 hours). Instruct parents to discard any un-used portions after 48 hours. To warm refrigerated formula, advise the parents to place the bottle in a pan of hot water and test the temper-ature by letting a few drops fall on the inside of the wrist.If it is comfortably warm to the mother, it is the correcttemperature. Formula-Feeding Assistance The process of feeding a newborn formula from a bottleshould mirror breast-feeding as closely as possible. Al-though nutrition is important, so are the emotional andinteractive components of feeding. Encourage parents tocuddle their newborn closely and position him or her sothat the head is in a comfortable position, not too far backor turned, which makes swallowing difcult. Also urgeparents to communicate with their newborn during thefeedings by talking and singing to him or her. Although it may seem that bottle feeding is not a dif- ficult task, many new parents find it awkward. At firstglance, holding an infant and a bottle appears simpleenough, but both the position of the baby and the angleof the bottle must be correct. Formula-Feeding Positions Advise mothers to feed their newborns in a relaxed andquiet setting to create a sense of calm for themselves andthe baby. Make sure that comfort is a priority for bothmother and newborn. The mother can sit in a comfort-able chair, using a pillow to support the arm in which sheis holding the baby. The mother can cradle the newborn514 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN in a semi-upright position, supporting the newborn's head in the crook of her arm. Holding the newborn close duringfeeding provides stimulation and helps prevent choking.Holding the newborn's head raised slightly will help pre-vent formula from washing backward into the eustachiantubes in the ears, which can lead to an ear infection. Formula-Feeding Education Parents require teaching about the correct preparationand storage of formula as well as the techniques for feed-ing. See Teaching Guidelines 18.5. Proper positioning makes bottle feeding easier and more enjoyable for both mother and newborn. As in breast-feeding, frequent burping is key. Advise the parents to holdthe bottle so that formula lls the nipple, thus allowing lessair to enter. Infants get fussy when they swallow air duringfeedings and need to be relieved of it every 2 to 3 oz. TEACHING GUIDELINES 18.5 Formula-Feeding Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing formula. Mix the formula and water amounts exactly as thelabel species. Always hold the newborn and bottle during feedings;never prop the bottle. Never freeze formula or warm it in the microwave. Place refrigerated formula in a pan of hot water fora few minutes to warm. Test the temperature of the formula by shaking afew drops on the wrist. Hold the bottle like a pencil, keeping it tipped toprevent air from entering. Position the bottle so thatthe nipple remains lled with milk. Burp the infant after every few ounces to allow airswallowed to escape. Move the nipple around in the infant's mouth tostimulate sucking. Always keep a bulb syringe close by to use if choking occurs. Avoid putting the infant to bed with a bottle to prevent \"baby bottle tooth decay.\" Feed the newborn approximately every 3 to 4 hours. Use an iron-fortied formula for the rst year. Prepare enough formula for the next 24 hours. Check nipples regularly and discard any that aresticky, cracked, or leaking. Store unmixed, open liquid formula in the refrigeratorfor up to 48 hours. Throw away any formula left in the bottle after each feeding. 11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 514Emphasize to parents that an electrolyte imbalance can occur in infants who are fed formula that has been in-correctly mixed. Hypernatremia can result from formulathat is mixed too thickly; the high concentration of sodiumis too much for the baby's immature kidneys to handle. Asa result, sodium is excreted along with water, leading todehydration. Mixing the formula with too much water inan effort to save money can lead to failure to thrive andlack of weight gain (AAP, 2007b). Weaning and Introduction of Solid Foods Eventually, breast-feeding or formula feeding ends. Wean-ing involves the transition from breast to bottle, from breastor bottle to cup, or from liquids to solids. Weaning frombreast-feeding to cup has several advantages over weaningto a bottle because it eliminates the step of weaning rst toa bottle and then to a cup. Another advantage is that thebottle does not become a security object for the infant. Weaning can be done because the mother is return- ing to work and cannot keep breast-feeding, or becausethe infant is losing interest in breast-feeding and showingsigns of independence. There is no \"right\" time to wean;it depends on the desires of the mother and infant. Wean-ing represents a signicant change in the way the motherand infant interact, and each mother must decide for her-self when she and her infant are ready to take that step.Either one can start the weaning process, but usually itoccurs between 6 months and 1 year of age. To begin weaning from the breast, instruct mothers to substitute breast-feeding with a cup or bottle. Often themidday feeding is the easiest feeding to replace. A trainercup with two handles and a snap-on lid with a spout isappropriate and minimizes spilling. Because weaning isa gradual process, it may take months. Instruct parents toproceed slowly and let the infant's willingness and interestguide them. Weaning from the bottle to the cup also needs to be timed appropriately for mother and infant. Typically, thenight bottle is the last to be given up, with cup drinkingsubstituted throughout the day. Slowly diluting the for-mula with water over a week can help in this process; thenal result is an all-water bottle. To prevent the baby fromsucking on the bottle during the night, remove it from thecrib after the infant falls asleep. When infants double their birthweight and weigh at least 13 lb, it is time to consider introducing solid foods.Readiness cues include: Consumption of 32 oz of formula or breast milk daily (estimated) Ability to sit up with minimal support and turn head away to indicate fullness Reduction of protrusion reflex so cereal can be propelled to back of throat Demonstration of interest in food others around them are eatingCHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 515 Ability to open mouth automatically when food approaches it When introducing solid foods, certain principles apply: Only one new single-ingredient food (e.g., rice cereal or carrots) should be introduced at a time to watch forallergies. Infants should be allowed to set the pace regarding how much they wish to eat. New foods should not be introduced more frequently than every 3 to 5 days. Fruits are added after cereals; then vegetables and meats are introduced; eggs are introduced last. A relaxed, unhurried, calm atmosphere for meals is important. A variety of foods are provided to ensure a balanced diet. Infants should never be force-fed (Lawson, 2007). Nurses can promote good feeding practices by ac- tively listening to new mothers, helping them clarify theirfeelings and discussing solutions. A warm, sincere man-ner and tone of voice will put an anxious mother at ease.Giving accurate information, making suggestions, andpresenting options will enable the mother to decide whatis best for her and her infant. Nurses should be sensitiveto the individual, family, and economic and cultural dif-ferences among mothers before offering suggestions forfeeding practices that may not be appropriate. Preparing for Discharge Preparing the parents for discharge is an essential task for the nurse. Because of today's shorter hospital stays, thenurse must identify the major teaching topics that needto be covered. Nurses should assess the parents' baselineknowledge and learning needs and plan how to meet them.Using the following principles fosters a learner-centeredapproach: Make the environment conducive to learning. Encour- age the parents to feel comfortable during this intensetime by using support and praise. Allow the parents to provide input about the content and the process of learning. What do they want andneed to learn? Build the parents' self-esteem by conrming that their responses to the entire birthing process and aftercareare legitimate, and others have felt the same way. Ensure that what the parents learn is relevant to their day-to-day home situation. Encourage responsibility by reinforcing that their emotional and physical responses are within the normal range. Respect cultural beliefs and practices that are impor- tant to the family by taking into account their heritageand health beliefs regarding newborn care. Examplesinclude placing a bellyband over the newborn's navel11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 Page African-Americans), newborn (Asian-Americans and Haitians), and delaying breast-feeding (Native Americans; they regard colostrum as \"bad\") (Bowers, 2007). While in the hospital, women have ready access to support and hands-on instruction regarding feeding andnewborn care. When the new mother is discharged, thisclose supervision and support by nurses should not endabruptly. Providing the new parents with the phone num-ber of the mother-baby unit will help them through thisstressful transitional period. Giving the new family infor-mation and offering backup support via the telephonewill increase parenting success. Consider THIS! I have always prided myself on being very organizedand in control in most situations, but survival at homeafter childbirth wasn't one of them. I left the hospital24 hours after giving birth to my son because my doctorsaid I could. The postpartum nurse encouraged me tostay longer, but wanting to be in control and sleepingin my own bed again won out. I thought my baby wouldbe sleeping while I sent out birth announcements to myfriends and family\u2014wrong! What happened insteadwas my son didn't sleep as I imagined and my nipplesbecame sore after breast-feeding every few hours. I wasweary and tired and wanted to sleep, but I couldn't.Somehow I thought I would be getting a full night'ssleep because I was up throughout the day, but thatwas a fantasy too. At 2 o'clock in the morning whenyou are up feeding your baby, you feel you are the onlyone in the world up at that time and feel very muchalone. My feelings of being organized and in controlall the time have changed dramatically since I left thehospital. I have learned to yield to the important needsof my son and derive satisfaction from being able tobring comfort to him and to let go of my control. Thoughts: It is interesting to see how a newborn changed this woman's need to organize and controlher environment. What \"tips of survival\" could thenurse offer this woman to help in her transition tohome with her newborn? How can friends and familyhelp when women arrive home from the hospital withtheir newborns? Ensuring Follow-Up Care Most newborns are scheduled for their rst health follow-up appointment within 2 to 4 days after discharge so theycan have additional laboratory work done as part of thenewborn screening series, especially if they were dis-charged within 48 hours. After this rst visit, the typicalschedule of health care visits is as follows: 2 to 4 weeks ofage; 2, 4, and 6 months of age for checkups and vaccines;516 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN 9 months of age for a checkup; 12 months for a checkup and tuberculosis testing; 15 and 18 months for checkupsand vaccines; and 2 years of age for a checkup. Theseappointments provide an opportunity for parents to askquestions and receive anticipatory guidance as their new-born grows and develops. In addition to encouraging parents to keep follow-up appointments, advise parents to call their health careprovider if they notice signs of illness in their newborn.They should know which over-the-counter medicinesshould be kept on hand. Review the following warningsigns of illness with parents: Temperature of 38.3 \u00b0C (101 \u00b0F) or higher Forceful, persistent vomiting, not just spitting up Refusal to take feedings Two or more green, watery diarrheal stools Infrequent wet diapers and change in bowel movements from normal pattern Lethargy or excessive sleepiness Inconsolable crying and extreme fussiness Abdominal distention Difcult or labored breathing Providing Immunization Information Parents also need instructions about immunizations fortheir newborn. Immunization is the process of rendering an individual immune or of becoming immune to certaincommunicable diseases (AAP, 2007). The purpose of theimmune system is to identify unknown (non-self) sub-stances in the body and develop a defense against theseinvaders. Disease prevention by immunization is a publichealth priority and is one of the leading health indicatorsas part of Healthy People 2010. Despite many advances in vaccine delivery, the goal of universal immunization hasnot been reached (AAP, 2007). Nurses can help to meetthis national goal by educating new parents about the im-portance of disease prevention through immunizations. Immunity can be provided either passively or actively. Passive immunity is protection transferred via alreadyformed antibodies from one person to another. Passiveimmunity includes transplacental passage of antibodiesfrom a mother to her newborn, immunity passed throughbreast milk, and immunity from immunoglobulins. Passiveimmunity provides limited protection and decreases overa period of weeks or months (Blackburn, 2007). Activeimmunity is protection produced by an individual's ownimmune system. It can be obtained by having the actualdisease or by receiving a vaccine that produces an immuno-logic response by that person's body. Active immunity maybe lifelong either way. Young infants and children are susceptible to various illnesses because their immune systems are not yet mature.Many of these illnesses can be prevented by following therecommended schedule of childhood immunizations;Figure 18.22 shows the 2008 Childhood Immunization11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 516CHAPTER 18 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN 517 Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons Aged 0-6 Years \u2014UNITED STATES \u0081 2008 For those who fall behind or start late, see the catch-up schedule Certain high-risk groupsRange of recommended ages 1. Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). (Minimum age: birth) At birth: \u0081 Administer monovalent HepB to all newborns prior to hospital discharge. \u0081 If mother is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, administer HepB and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. \u0081 If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, administer HepB within 12 hours of birth. Determine the HBsAg status as soon as possible and if HBsAg positive, administer HBIG (no later than age 1 week). \u0081 If mother is HBsAg negative, the birth dose can be delayed, in rare cases, with a provider's order and a copy of the mother's negative HBsAg laboratory report in the infant's medical record. After the birth dose: \u0081 The HepB series should be completed with either monovalent HepB or a combination vaccine containing HepB. The second dose should be administered at age 1-2 months. The final dose should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg after completion of at least 3 doses of a licensed HepB series, at age 9-18 months (generally at the next well-child visit). 4-month dose: \u0081 It is permissible to administer 4 doses of HepB when combination vaccines are administered after the birth dose. If monovalent HepB is used for doses after the birth dose, a dose at age 4 months is not needed. 2. Rotavirus vaccine (Rota). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) \u0081 Administer the first dose at age 6-12 weeks. \u0081 Do not start the series later than age 12 weeks. \u0081 Administer the final dose in the series by age 32 weeks. Do not administer any dose later than age 32 weeks. \u0081 Data on safety and efficacy outside of these age ranges are insufficient. 3. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) \u0081 The fourth dose of DTaP may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided 6 months have elapsed since the third dose. \u0081 Administer the final dose in the series at age 4-6 years. 4. Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib). \u0081 If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB\u00ae or ComVax\u00ae [Merck]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. \u0081 TriHIBit\u00ae (DTaP/Hib) combination products should not be used for primary immunization but can be used as boosters following any Hib vaccine in children age 12 months or older.5. Pneumococcal vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for pneumococcal 2 years for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPV]) \u0081 Administer one dose of PCV to all healthy children aged 24-59 months having any incomplete schedule. \u0081 Administer PPV to children aged 2 years and older with underlying medical conditions. 6. Influenza vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 months for trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [TIV]; 2 years for live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) \u0081 Administer annually to children aged 6-59 months and to all eligible close contacts of children aged 0-59 months. \u0081 Administer annually to children 5 years of age and older with certain risk factors, to other persons (including household members) in close contact with persons in groups at higher risk, and to any child whose parents request vaccination. \u0081 For healthy persons (those who do not have underlying medical conditions that predispose them to influenza complications) ages 2-49 years, either LAIV or TIV may be used. \u0081 Children receiving TIV should receive 0.25 mL if age 6-35 months or 0.5 mL if age 3 years or older. \u0081 Administer 2 doses (separated by 4 weeks or longer) to children younger than 9 years who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time or who were vaccinated for the first time last season but only received one dose. 7. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). (Minimum age: 12 months) \u0081 Administer the second dose of MMR at age 4-6 years. MMR may be administered before age 4 -6 years, provided 4 weeks or more have elapsed since the first dose . 8. Varicella vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) \u0081 Administer second dose at age 4-6 years; may be administered 3 months or more after first dose. \u0081 Do not repeat second dose if administered 28 days or more after first dose. 9. Hepatitis A vaccine (HepA). (Minimum age: 12 months) \u0081 Administer to all children aged 1 year (i.e., aged 12-23 months). Administer the 2 doses in the series at least 6 months apart. \u0081 Children not fully vaccinated by age 2 years can be vaccinated at subsequent visits. \u0081 HepA is recommended for certain other groups of children, including in areas where vaccination programs target older children. 10. Meningococcal vaccine. (Minimum age: 2 years for meningococcal Administer MCV4 to children aged 2-10 years with terminal complement deficiencies or anatomic or functional asplenia and certain other high-risk groups. MPSV4 is also acceptable. \u0081 Administer MCV4 to persons who received MPSV4 3 or more years previously and remain at increased risk for meningococcal disease.This schedule indicates the recommended ages for routine administration of currently licensed childhood vaccines, as of December 1, 2007, for children aged 0 through 6 years. Additional information is available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules . Any dose not administered at the recommended age should be administered at any subsequent visit, when indicated and feasible. Additional vaccines may be licensed and recommended during the year. Licensed combination vaccines may be used whenever any components of the combination are indicated and other components of the vaccine are not contraindicated and if approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that dose of the series. Providers should consult the respective Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices statement for detailed recommendations, including for high-risk conditions: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ACIP-list.htm . Clinically significant adverse events that follow immunization should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Guidance about how to obtain and complete a VAERS form is available at www.vaers.hhs.gov or by telephone, schedule.11223-18_CH18.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 517Schedule. Readers can view the latest CDC immunization schedule by visiting www.cdc.gov/nip. The schedule for immunizations should be reviewed with parents, stress-ing the importance of continued follow-up health care to preserve their infant's health. The newborn's first immunization (hepatitis B) is received in the hospital soon after birth. The rst dosecan also be given by age 2 months if the mother is HbsAgnegative. If the mother is HbsAg positive, then the new-born should receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis Bimmunoglobulin within 12 hours of birth (Cunninghamet al., 2005). Education for the parents should include the risks and benefits for each vaccine and possible adverse effects.Federal law requires a consent form to be signed beforeadministering a vaccine. Parents have the right to refuseimmunizations based on their religious beliefs and cansign a waiver noting their decision. The nurse administer-ing the vaccine must document the date and time it wasgiven, name and manufacturer, lot number and expirationdate of the vaccine given, site and route of administration,and the name and title of the nurse who administered thevaccine. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546The period of transition from intrauterine to extra- uterine life occurs during the rst several hours afterbirth. It is a time of stabilization for the newborn's tem-perature, respiration, and cardiovascular dynamics. /H18546The newborn's bowel is sterile at birth. It usually takes about a week for the newborn to produce vitamin K insufcient quantities to prevent VKDB. /H18546It is recommended that all newborns in the United States receive an instillation of a prophylactic agent(erythromycin or tetracycline ophthalmic ointment) intheir eyes within an hour or two of being born. /H18546Nursing measures to maintain newborns' body tem- perature include drying them immediately after birthto prevent heat loss through evaporation, wrapping themin prewarmed blankets, putting a hat on their head, andplacing them under a temperature-controlled radiantwarmer. /H18546The specic components of a typical newborn exami- nation include a general survey of skin color, posture,state of alertness, head size, overall behavioral state,respiratory status, gender, and any obvious congenitalanomalies. /H18546Gestational age assessment is pertinent because it allows the nurse to plot growth parameters and to anticipatepotential problems related to prematurity/postmaturityand growth abnormalities such as SGA/LGA. /H18546After the newborn has passed the transitional period and stabilized, the nurse needs to complete ongoing as-sessments, vital signs, weight and measurements, cordcare, hygiene measures, newborn screening tests, and518 UNIT SIX THENEWBORN various other tasks until the newborn is discharged home from the birthing unit. /H18546Important topics about which to educate parents in- clude environmental safety, newborn characteristics,feeding and bathing, circumcision and cord care, sleepand elimination patterns of newborns, safe infant carseats, holding/positioning, and follow-up care. /H18546Newborn screening tests consist of hearing and certain genetic and inborn errors of metabolism tests requiredin most states for newborns before discharge from thebirth facility. /H18546The AAP and the American Dietetic Association recom- mend breast-feeding exclusively for the rst 6 months oflife and that it continue along with other food at leastuntil the rst birthday. /H18546Parents who choose not to breast-feed need to know what types of formula are available, preparation andstorage of formula, equipment, feeding positions, andhow much to feed their infant. /H18546Common problems associated with the newborn in- clude transient tachypnea, physiologic jaundice, andhypoglycemia. /H18546Transient tachypnea of is accompanied by retractions, expiratory grunt-ing, or cyanosis; and is relieved by low-dose oxygen. /H18546Physiologic jaundice is a very common condition in new- borns, with the majority demonstrating yellowish skin,mucous membranes, and sclera within the rst 3 days oflife. Newborns undergoing phototherapy in the treat-ment of jaundice require close monitoring of their bodytemperature, fluid, and electrolyte balance; observationof skin integrity; eye protection; and parental participa-tion in their care. /H18546The newborn with hypoglycemia requires close monitor- ing for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia if present.In addition, newborns at high risk need to be identiedbased on their perinatal history, physical examination,body measurements, and gestational age. Blood glucoselevels of all newborns are checked within the rst fewhours after birth and every 4 hours thereafter. /H18546The schedule for immunizations should be reviewed with parents, stressing the importance of continualfollow-up health care to preserve their infant's health.

Un-fortunately, conditions can occur that may result in nega-tive outcomes for the fetus, mother, or both. A high-risk pregnancy is one in which a condition exists that jeop- ardizes the health of the mother, her fetus, or both. Thecondition may result from the pregnancy, or it may bea condition that was present before the woman becamepregnant. Approximately one in four pregnant women is con- sidered to be at high risk or diagnosed with complications(Jung & Erogul, 2007). Women who are considered to beat high risk have a higher morbidity and mortality com-pared with mothers in the general population. The riskstatus of a woman and her fetus can change during thepregnancy, with a number of problems occurring duringlabor, birth, or afterward, even in women without anyknown previous antepartal risk. Examples of high-risk con- ditions include gestational diabetes and ectopic pregnancy.These conditions are specifically addressed in Healthy People 2010. Early identication of the woman at risk is essential to ensure that appropriate interventions are insti-tuted promptly, increasing the opportunity to change thecourse of events and provide a positive outcome. The term \"risk\" may mean different things to different groups. For example, health care professionals may focuson the disease processes and treatments to prevent com-526 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK plications. Nurses may focus on nursing care and on the psychosocial impact on the woman and her family. Insur-ance companies may concentrate on the economic issuesrelated to the high-risk status. The woman's attention maybe focused on her own needs and those of her family. To-gether, working as a collaborative team, the ultimate goalof care is to ensure the best possible outcome for thewoman, her fetus, and her family. Risk assessment begins at the rst antepartal visit and continues with each subsequent visit because factors maybe identied in later visits that were not apparent duringearlier visits. For example, as the nurse and client developa trusting relationship, previously unidentied or unsus-pected factors (such as drug abuse or intimate partner vio-lence) may be revealed. Through education and support,the nurse can encourage the client to inform her health careprovider of these concerns, and necessary interventions orreferrals can be made. Various factors must be considered when determin- ing a woman's risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (Britt,Eden, & Evans, 2006), and a comprehensive approach tohigh-risk pregnancy is needed. For example, prenatal stressand distress have been shown to have significant conse-quences for the mother, child, and family (Price et al.,2007). Risks are grouped into broad categories based onthreats to health and pregnancy outcome. Current cate-gories of risk are biophysical, psychosocial, sociodemo-graphic, and environmental (Gilbert, 2007) (Box 19.1). This chapter describes the major conditions directly related to the pregnancy that can complicate a pregnancy,possibly affecting maternal and fetal outcomes. These in-clude bleeding during pregnancy (spontaneous abortion,ectopic pregnancy, amniotic fluid imbalances (hydramnios and oligo-hydramnios), multiple gestation, and premature ruptureof membranes. Chapter 20 addresses preexisting condi-tions that can complicate a woman's pregnancy as well aspopulations that are considered to be at high risk. Bleeding During Pregnancy Bleeding at any time during pregnancy is potentiallylife-threatening. Bleeding can occur early or late in thepregnancy and may result from numerous conditions.Conditions commonly associated with early bleeding (rsthalf of pregnancy) include spontaneous abortion, ectopicpregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease, and condi-tions associated with midtrimester bleeding, such as cer-vical insufciency. Conditions associated with late bleeding include placenta previa and abruptio placentae, whichusually occur after the 20th week of gestation.M Decrease the proportion of pregnant women with gestational diabetes Reduce ectopic pregnanciesWill help to promote proper prepregnant and pregnancyglycemic control; foster carefulperinatal obstetric monitoring,thereby helping to reduce peri-natal death and congenital abnormalities Will help to reinforce the importance of good nutritionduring pregnancy as paramountin increasing better pregnancyoutcomes Will help to focus attention on the need for initiating prenatalcare early and for continuedmonitoring throughout preg-nancy, thus helping to decreasematernal mortality related toectopic pregnancies throughearly detection Source: U.S. DHHS, PEOPLE 2010 PEOPLE 2010 Objective Signicance11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 526SPONTANEOUS ABORTION An abortion is the loss of an early pregnancy, usually be- fore week 20 of gestation. Abortion can be spontaneous orinduced. A spontaneous abortion refers to the loss of a fetusresulting from natural causes\u2014that is, not elective or ther-apeutically induced by a procedure. The term miscarriage is often used by nonmedical people to denote an abortionthat has occurred spontaneously. A miscarriage can occurduring early pregnancy, and many women who miscarrymay not even be aware that they are pregnant. About 80%of spontaneous abortions occur within the rst trimester. The overall rate for spontaneous abortion in the United States is reported to be 15% to 20% of recognizedpregnancies in the United States. However, with the devel-opment of highly sensitive assays for human chorionic go-nadotropin (hCG) levels that detect pregnancies prior tothe expected next menses, the incidence of 60% to 70% (Puscheck &Pradhan, OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 527 Pathophysiology The causes of spontaneous abortion are varied and often unknown. The most common cause for rst-trimesterabortions is fetal genetic abnormalities, usually unrelatedto the mother. Those occurring during the second trimesterare more likely related to maternal conditions, such asincompetent cervix, congenital or acquired anomaly ofthe uterine cavity, hypothyroidism, use of crack cocaine, inherited andacquired thrombophilias, lupus, acute infection such as herpes simplex virus, bacterial vaginosis, and toxoplasmosis (Simpson, 2007). Nursing Assessment When a pregnant woman calls and reports vaginal bleed- ing, she must be seen as soon as possible by a health careprofessional to ascertain the etiology. Varying degrees ofvaginal bleeding, low back pain, abdominal cramping, andpassage of products of conception tissue may be reported.BOX 19.1 Factors Placing a Woman at Risk During Pregnancy Biophysical Factors Genetic conditions Chromosomal abnormalities Multiple pregnancy Defective genes Inherited disorders ABO incompatibility Large fetal size Medical and obstetric conditions Preterm labor and birth Cardiovascular disease Chronic hypertension Incompetent cervix Placental abnormalities Infection Diabetes Maternal collagen diseases Pregnancy-induced hypertension Asthma Postterm pregnancy Hemoglobinopathies Nutritional status Inadequate dietary intake Food fads Excessive food intake Under- or overweight status Hematocrit value less than 33% Eating disorderPsychosocial Factors Smoking Caffeine Alcohol Drugs Inadequate support system Situational crisis History of violence Emotional distress Unsafe cultural practices Sociodemographic Factors Poverty status Lack of prenatal care Age younger than 15 years or older than 35 years Parity\u2014all rst pregnancies and more than ve pregnancies Marital status\u2014increased risk for unmarried Accessibility to health care Ethnicity\u2014increased risk in nonwhite women Environmental Factors Infections Radiation Pesticides Illicit drugs Industrial pollutants Second-hand cigarette smoke Personal stress (Gilbert, Page 527Ask the woman about the color of the vaginal bleeding (bright red is signicant) and the amount\u2014for example,question her about the frequency with which she is chang-ing her peripads (saturation of one peripad hourly is sig-nicant) and the passage of any clots or tissue. Instructher to save any tissue or clots passed and bring them withher to the health care facility. Also, obtain a descriptionof any other signs and symptoms the woman may be ex-periencing, along with a description of their severity andduration. It is important to remain calm and listen to thewoman's description. When the woman arrives at the health care facility, assess her vital signs and observe the amount, color, andcharacteristics of the bleeding. Ask her to rate her currentpain level, using an appropriate pain assessment tool. Also,evaluate the amount and intensity of the woman's abdom-inal cramping or contractions, and assess the woman'slevel of understanding about what is happening to her.A thorough assessment helps in determining the type ofspontaneous abortion, such as threatened abortion, in-evitable abortion, incomplete abortion, complete abortion,missed abortion, and habitual abortion, that the womanmay be experiencing (Table 19.1). Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with a spontaneousabortion focuses on providing continued monitoring andpsychological support, for the family is experiencing acuteloss and grief. An important component of this supportis reassuring the woman that spontaneous abortions usu-ally result from an abnormality and that her actions didnot cause the abortion. Providing Continued Monitoring Continued monitoring and ongoing assessments are essen-tial for the woman experiencing a spontaneous abortion.Monitor the amount of vaginal bleeding through padcounts an d observe for passage of products of conception tissue. Assess the woman's pain and provide appropriatepain management to address the cramping discomfort. Assist in preparing the woman for procedures and treatments such as surgery to evacuate the uterus ormedications such as misoprostol or PGE2. If the womanis Rh negative and not sensitized, expect to administerRhoGAM within 72 hours after the abortion is complete.Drug Guide 19.1 gives more information about thesemedications. Providing Support A woman's emotional reaction may vary depending onher desire for this pregnancy and her available supportnetwork. Provide both physical and emotional support.In addition, prepare the woman and her family for the as-sessment process, and answer their questions about whatis happening.528 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Explaining some of the causes of spontaneous abor- tions can help the woman to understand what is happeningand may allay her fears and guilt that she did somethingto cause this pregnancy loss. Most women experiencean acute sense of loss and go through a grieving processwith a spontaneous abortion. Providing sensitive listen-ing, counseling, and anticipatory guidance to the womanand her family will allow them to verbalize their feelingsand ask questions about future pregnancies. The grieving period may last as long as 2 years after a pregnancy loss, with each person grieving in his or herown way. Encourage friends and family to be supportivebut give the couple space and time to work through theirloss. Referral to a community support group for parentswho have experienced a miscarriage can be very helpfulduring this grief process. ECTOPIC PREGNANCY An ectopic pregnancy is any pregnancy in which the fertilized ovum implants outside the uterine cavity. Ec-topic pregnancies occur in from 1 in every 40 to 1 in every100 pregnancies in the United States (March of Dimes,2007). Their incidence has increased dramatically in thepast few decades as a result of improved diagnostic tech-niques, such as more sensitive beta-hCG assays and theavailability of transvaginal ultrasound (Silver, 2007). With an ectopic pregnancy, rupture and hemorrhage may occur due to the growth of the embryo. A rupturedectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency. It is a poten-tially life-threatening condition and involves pregnancyloss. It is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the rsttrimester and accounts for 10% to 15% of all pregnancy-related deaths (Lipscomb, 2007). Pathophysiology Normally, the fertilized ovum implants in the uterus. Withan ectopic pregnancy, the ovum implants outside theuterus. The most common site for implantation is thefallopian tubes, but some ova may implant in the cornuaof the uterus, the ovary, the cervix, or the abdominal cav-ity (Fig. 19.1) (Sepilian & Wood, 2007). None of theseanatomic sites can accommodate placental attachment ora growing embryo. Ectopic pregnancies usually result from conditions that obstruct or slow the passage of the fertilized ovumthrough the fallopian tube to the uterus. This may be aphysical blockage in the tube, or failure of the tubal ep-ithelium to move the zygote (the cell formed after the eggis fertilized) down the tube into the uterus. In the generalpopulation, most cases are the result of tubal scarring sec-ondary to pelvic inflammatory disease.

Methotrexate, prostaglandins, misoprostol, and ac- tinomycin have all been used in the medical (nonsurgical)management of ectopic pregnancy, with a reported successrate of approximately 90% (Lipscomb, 2007). Methotrexate, the agent most commonly used, is a folic acid antagonist that inhibits cell division in the devel-oping embryo. It typically has been used as a chemother- apeutic agent in the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas,and carcinomas. It has been shown to produce resultssimilar to that for surgical therapy in terms of high suc-cess rate, low complication rate, and good reproductivepotential (Vitthala, Cheema, Misra, 2007). Adverseeffects nausea,vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, gastric upset, increasedabdominal pain, and dizziness. Prior to receiving thesingle-dose intramuscular injection to treat unrupturedpregnancies, the woman needs to be counseled on therisks, benefits, adverse effects, and the possibility of fail-ure of medical therapy, which would result in tubal rup-ture, necessitating surgery (Selway, 2006).

Monitor for headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and heavy bleeding. Anticipate administration of antiemetic prior to use to reduce nausea and vomiting. Encourage client to use acetaminophen to reduce discomfort from cramping. Bring gel to room temperature before administering. Avoid contact with skin. Use sterile technique to administer. Keep client supine 30 minutes after administering. Document time of insertion and dosing intervals. Remove insert with retrieval system after 12 hours or at the onset of labor. Explain purpose and expected response to client. Administer intramuscularly in deltoid area. Give only MICRhoGAM for abortions and miscarriages <12 weeks unless fetus or father isRh negative (unless patient is Rh positive, Rhantibodies are present). Educate woman that she will need this after subsequent deliveries if newborns are Rh posi-tive; also check lab study results prior to admin-istering drug. as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia attack the fallopian tubes, producing silent infec-tions. A recent study reported a twofold increased risk forectopic pregnancy in women with a history of a chlamydiainfection (Bakken, Skjeldestad, & Nordbo, 2007). Evenwith early treatment, tubal damage can occur. Therapeutic Management The therapeutic management of ectopic pregnancy de- pends on whether the tube is intact or has ruptured. His-torically, the treatment of ectopic pregnancy was limitedto surgery, but medical therapy is currently available. If the fallopian tube is still intact, medical manage- ment becomes an option. To be eligible for medical ther-apy, the client must be hemodynamically stable, with nosigns of active bleeding in the peritoneal cavity, and themass (which must measure less than 4 cm as determinedby ultrasound) must be unruptured (Lipscomb, 2007).The potential advantages include avoidance of surgery,the preservation tubal patency and function, and a lower11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 530is then instructed to return weekly for follow-up labora- tory studies for the next several weeks until beta-hCGtiters decrease. Surgical management for the unruptured fallopian tube might involve a linear salpingostomy to preserve theCHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 531 tube\u2014an important consideration for the woman wanting to preserve her future fertility. With a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, surgery is neces- sary as a result of possible uncontrolled hemorrhage. A lap-arotomy with a removal of the tube (salpingectomy) maybe necessary. With earlier diagnosis and medical manage-ment, the focus has changed from preventing maternaldeath to facilitating rapid recovery and preserving fertility. Regardless of the treatment approach (medical or sur- gical), the woman's beta-hCG level is monitored until itis undetectable to ensure that any residual trophoblastictissue that forms the placenta is gone. Also, all Rh-negativeunsensitized clients are given Rh immunoglobulin toprevent isoimmunization in future pregnancies. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment focuses on determining the existence of an ectopic pregnancy and whether or not it has ruptured. Health History and Physical Examination Assess the client thoroughly for signs and symptoms thatmay suggest an ectopic pregnancy. The onset of signs andsymptoms varies, but they usually begin at about the sev-enth or eighth week of gestation. A missed menstrual pe-riod, adnexal fullness, and tenderness may indicate anunruptured tubal pregnancy. As the tube stretches, the pain Fallopian tube CervixIntestine AbdomenOvary FIGURE19.1 Possible sites for implantation with an ectopic pregnancy. Study The incidence of ectopic pregnancy, which involves im plan- tation of the fertilized ovum outside the uterine cavity, hasincreased over the past several decades due to advancesin diagnostic methods. The most common site for implan-tation is in the fallopian tube (thus the name tubal preg-nancy). If left untreated, tubal rupture and hemorrhage canoccur. At one time, surgery was the only available treatmentoption. However, treatment today may involve expectantcare, medication therapy, or surgery (laparoscopic or openapproach). Questions have arisen as to the effectivenessand safety of these treatments. A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of major types of treatment for ectopic pregnancy. Data were collected from 35 randomized controlled trials thatcompared the treatments for ectopic pregnancies. Findings The open approach to surgery was signicantly more effective in removing the ectopic pregnancy than the laparoscopic approach, but the laparoscopic approach was more cost-effective. Medication therapy involvingxed multiple doses of methotrexate was effective inwomen who had low pregnancy hormone levels withoutany evidence of bleeding. Expectant management wasless successful than drug therapy, but the information onthis treatment option was inadequate. Nursing Implications This study identified three important treatment optionsavailable to a woman with an ectopic pregnancy. Nursescan use this information in their practice as a basis forformulating a teaching plan about treatment options.Nurses can use the information from this study when reviewing the health care provider's recommendations fortreatment. As a result, women can make a more informeddecision. Nurses also can advocate for medication ther-apy for women who have low pregnancy hormone levelsand no bleeding.

Pain may be unilateral, bilateral, or diffuse over the abdomen.532 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy or impending abortion. Additional tests may be done to rule out other conditionssuch as spontaneous abortion, ruptured ovarian cyst, ap-pendicitis, and salpingitis. Nursing Management Nursing management for the woman with an ectopic preg- nancy focuses on preparing the woman for treatment, pro-viding support, and providing education about preventivemeasures. Preparing the Woman for Treatment Administer analgesics as ordered to promote comfort andrelieve discomfort from abdominal pain. Although the in-tensity of the pain can vary, women often report a greatdeal of pain. If the woman is treated medically, explainthe medication that will be used and what she can expect.Also review signs and symptoms of possible adverse effects.If treatment will occur on an outpatient basis, outline thesigns and symptoms of ectopic rupture (severe, sharp, stab-bing, unilateral abdominal pain; vertigo/fainting; hypo-tension; and increased pulse) and advise the woman toseek medical help immediately if they occur. If surgery is needed, close assessment and monitoring of the client's vital signs, bleeding (peritoneal or vaginal),and pain status are critical to identify hypovolemic shock,which may occur with tubal rupture. Prepare the clientphysiologically and psychologically for surgery or any pro-cedure. Provide a clear explanation of the expected out- come. Astute vigilance and early referral will help reduceshort- and long-term morbidity. Providing Emotional Support The woman with an ectopic pregnancy requires support throughout diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare. A woman'spsychological reaction to an ectopic pregnancy is unpre-dictable. However, it is important to recognize she hasexperienced a pregnancy loss in addition to undergoingtreatment for a potentially life-threatening condition. Thewoman may find it difficult to comprehend what hashappened to her because events occur so quickly. In thewoman's mind, she had just started a pregnancy and nowit has ended abruptly. Help her to make this experience\"more real\" by encouraging her and her family to expresstheir feelings and concerns openly, and validating that thisis a loss of pregnancy and it is okay to grieve over the loss. Provide emotional support, spiritual care, client edu- cation, and information about community support groupsavailable (such as Resolve through Sharing) as the clientgrieves for the loss of her unborn child and comes to termswith the medical complications of the situation. Acknowl-edge the client's pregnancy and allow her to discuss herfeelings about what the pregnancy means. Also, stressthe need for follow-up blood testing for several weeks tomonitor hCG titers until they return to zero, indicating The hallmark of ectopic pregnancy is abdominal pain with spotting within 6 to 8 weeks after a missed menstrual period. Although this isthe classic triad, all three of these signs and symptoms occur in only about 50% of cases. Many women have symp-toms typical of early pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, nausea, fatigue, shoulder pain, and low back pain.Take NOTE! In addition, review the client's history for possible contributing factors. These may include: Previous ectopic pregnancy History of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Fallopian tube scarring from pelvic inflammatory disease In utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol Endometriosis Previous tubal or pelvic surgery Infertility and infertility treatments, including use of fertility drugs Uterine abnormalities such as broids Presence of intrauterine contraception Use of progestin-only mini-pill (slows ovum transport) Postpartum or post-abortion infection Increasing age (older than 35 years) Cigarette smoking (Brown-Guttovz, 2006) If rupture or hemorrhage occurs before treatment begins, symptoms may worsen and include severe, sharp,and sudden pain in the lower abdomen as the tube tearsopen and the embryo is expelled into the pelvic cavity;feelings of faintness; referred pain to the shoulder area,indicating bleeding into the abdomen, caused by phrenicnerve irritation; hypotension; marked abdominal tender-ness with distention; and hypovolemic shock. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The use of transvaginal ultrasound to visualize the mis- placed pregnancy and low levels of serum beta-hCG assistin diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy. The ultrasound deter-mines whether the pregnancy is intrauterine, assesses thesize of the uterus, and provides evidence of fetal viability.The visualization of an adnexal mass and the absence of anintrauterine gestational sac are diagnostic of ectopic preg-nancy (Condous, 2006). In a normal intrauterine preg-nancy, beta-hCG levels typically double every 2 to 4 daysuntil peak values are reached 60 to 90 days after concep-tion. Concentrations of hCG decrease after 10 to 11 weeksand reach a plateau at low levels by 100 to 130 days(Blackburn, 2007). Therefore, low beta-hCG levels are11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 532resolution of the ectopic pregnancy. Ask about her feel- ings and concerns about her future fertility, and provideteaching about the need to use contraceptives for at leastthree menstrual cycles to allow her reproductive tract toheal and the tissue to be repaired. Include the woman'spartner in this discussion to make sure both parties under-stand what has happened, what intervention is needed,and what the future holds regarding childbearing. Educating the Client Preventing ectopic pregnancies through screening and client education is essential. Many can be prevented byavoiding conditions that might cause scarring of the fallo-pian tubes. In addition, a contributing factor to the de-velopment of ectopic pregnancy is a previous ectopicpregnancy. Therefore, educating the woman is crucial. Prevention education may include the following: Reduce risk factors such as sexual intercourse with multiple partners or intercourse without a condom. Avoid contracting STIs that lead to pelvic inflamma- tory disease (PID). Obtain early diagnosis and adequate treatment of STIs. Avoid the use of intrauterine contraceptive methods to reduce the risk of repeat ascending infections, whichcan be responsible for tubal scarring. Use condoms to decrease the risk of infections that cause tubal scarring. Seek prenatal care early to conrm the location of pregnancy. GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE (GTD) Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) comprises a spectrum of neoplastic disorders that originate in theplacenta. Gestational tissue is present, but the pregnancyis not viable. The incidence is about 1 in 1,000 pregnan-cies in the United States; in Asian countries, the rate is asmuch as 15 times higher (Moore & Ware, 2007). Thetwo most common types of GTD are hydatidiform mole(partial and and choriocarcinoma. neoplasm of the chorionic villi degenerate and trans-parent vesicles containing clear, viscid fluid. Hydatiformmole is classied as complete or partial, distinguished bydifferences in clinical presentation, pathology, genetics,and epidemiology (Garner et al., 2007). The completemole contains no fetal tissue and develops from an \"empty egg,\" which is fertilized by a normal sperm (the paternalchromosomes replicate, resulting in 46 all-paternal chro-mosomes). The embryo is not viable and dies. No circu-CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 533 lation is established, and no embryonic tissue is found. The complete mole is associated with the developmentof choriocarcinoma. The partial mole has a triploidkaryotype (69 chromosomes), because two sperm haveprovided a double contribution by fertilizing the ovum(Fig. 19.2). Consider THIS! We had lived across the dorm hall from each other during nursing school but really didn't get to know eachother except for a casual hello in passing. When wegraduated, Rose went to work in the emergency roomand I in OB. We saw each other occasionally in theemployee cafeteria, but a quick hello was all that weusually exchanged. I heard she married one of theparamedics who worked in the ER and was soon preg-nant. I nally got to say more than hello when she wasadmitted to the OB unit bleeding during her fourthmonth of pregnancy. What was discovered was gesta-tional trophoblastic disease and not a normal pregnancy.I remember holding her in my arms as she wept. Shewas told she had a complete molar pregnancy aftersurgery, and she would need extensive follow-up for the next year. I lost track of her that summer as my life became busier. Around Thanksgiving time, I heard shehad died from choriocarcinoma. I attended her funeral,nally, to get the time to say a nal hello and good-bye,but this time with sadness and tears. Thoughts: Rose was only 26 years old when she succumbed to this very virulent cancer. I think back FIGURE19.2 Complete hydatiform mole. The chorionic villi (continued)11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 533534 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK monthly for 6 months, then every 2 months for the remainder of the year Chest radiograph every 6 months to detect pulmonary metastasis Regular pelvic examinations to assess uterine and ovarian regression Systemic assessments for symptoms indicative of lung, brain, liver, or vaginal metastasis Strong recommendation to avoid pregnancy for 1 year because the pregnancy can interfere with the monitoringof hCG levels Use of a reliable contraceptive for at least 1 year (Gilbert, 2007) Nursing Assessment The nurse plays a crucial role in identifying and bringingthis condition to the attention of the health care providerbased on sound knowledge of the typical clinical manifes-tations and through astute antepartal assessments. Clinical manifestations of GTD are very similar to those of spontaneous abortion at about 12 weeks of preg-nancy. Assess the woman for potential clinical manifes-tations at each antepartal visit. Be alert for the following: Report of early signs of pregnancy, such as amenorrhea, breast tenderness, fatigue Brownish vaginal bleeding/spotting Anemia Severe morning sickness (due to high hCG levels) Fluid retention and swelling Uterine size larger than expected for pregnancy dates Extremely high hCG levels present; no single value considered diagnostic Early development of preeclampsia (usually not present until after 24 weeks) Absence of fetal heart rate or fetal activity Expulsion of grapelike vesicles (possible in some women) The diagnosis is made by high hCG levels and the characteristic appearance of the vesicular molar patternin the uterus via transvaginal ultrasound. Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with GTD focuseson preparing her for a D&C, providing emotional supportto deal with the loss and potential risks, and educating herabout the risk that cancer may develop after a molar preg-nancy and the strict adherence needed with the follow-upprogram. The woman must understand the need for thecontinued follow-up care regimen to improve her chancesof future pregnancies and to ensure her continued qual-ity of life. Preparing the Client Upon diagnosis, the client will need an immediate evacua-tion of the uterus. Perform preoperative care, preparing theclient physically and psychologically for the procedure.Consider THIS! (continued) and realize I missed knowing this brave young woman and wished that I had taken the time to say more thanhello. Could her outcome have been different? Whywasn't it recognized earlier? Did she not follow upafter her diagnosis? I can only speculate regarding thewhom, what, and where. She lived a short but pur-poseful life, and hopefully continued research willchange other women's outcomes in the future. The exact cause of molar pregnancy is unknown, but researchers are looking into a genetic basis. Studies haverevealed some remarkable features about molar pregnan-cies, including: Ability to invade into the wall of the uterus Tendency to recur in subsequent pregnancies Possible development into choriocarcinoma, a virulent cancer with metastasis to other organs Influence of nutritional factors, such as protein deciency Tendency to affect older women more often than younger women Having a molar pregnancy (partial or complete) re- sults in the loss of the pregnancy and the possibility ofdeveloping choriocarcinoma, a chorionic malignancy fromthe trophoblastic tissue. The most frequent sites of metas-tases are the lungs, lower genital tract, brain, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract (Hernandez, 2007). Therapeutic Management Treatment consists of immediate evacuation of the uterinecontents as soon as the diagnosis is made and long-termfollow-up of the client to detect any remaining trophoblas-tic tissue that might become malignant. Dilation andsuction curettage (D&C) are used to empty the uterus. Thetissue obtained is sent to the laboratory for analysis toevaluate for choriocarcinoma. Serial levels of hCG areused to detect residual trophoblastic tissue for 1 year. Ifany tissue remains, hCG levels will not regress. In 80%of women with a benign hydatidiform mole, serum hCGtiters steadily drop to normal within 8 to 12 weeks afterevacuation of the molar pregnancy. In the other 20% ofwomen with a malignant hydatidiform mole, serum hCGlevels begin to rise (Hernandez, 2007). Due to the increased risk for cancer, the client is ad- vised to receive extensive follow-up therapy for the next12 months. The follow-up protocol may include: Baseline hCG level, chest radiograph, and pelvic ultrasound Weekly serum hCG level until it drops to zero and remains at that level for 3 consecutive weeks, then11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 534Providing Emotional Support To aid the client and her family in coping with the loss of the pregnancy and the possibility of a cancer diagnosis,use the following interventions: Listen to their concerns and fears. Allow them time to grieve for the pregnancy loss. Acknowledge their loss and sad feelings (say you are sorry for their loss). Encourage them to express their grief; allow them to cry. Provide them with as much factual information as pos- sible to help them make sense of what is happening. Enlist support from additional family and friends as appropriate and with the client's permission. Educating the Client After GTD is diagnosed, teach the client about the condi-tion and appropriate interventions that may be necessaryto save her life. Explain each phase of treatment accuratelyand provide support for the woman and her family as theygo through the grieving process. As with any facet of health care, be aware of the latest research and new therapies. Inform the client about herfollow-up care, which will probably involve close clinicalsurveillance for approximately 1 year, and reinforce its im-portance in monitoring the client's condition. Tell theclient that serial serum beta-hCG levels are used to detectresidual trophoblastic tissue. Continued high or increasinghCG titers are abnormal and need further evaluation. Inform the client about the possible use of chemother- apy, such as methotrexate, which may be started asprophylaxis. Strongly urge the client to use a reliablecontraceptive to prevent pregnancy for 1 year, as a preg-nancy would interfere with tracking the serial beta-hCGlevels used to identify a potential malignancy. Stress theneed for the client to cooperate and adhere to the plan oftherapy throughout this year-long follow-up. CERVICAL INSUFFICIENCY Cervical insufciency, also called premature dilatation of the cervix, describes a weak, structurally defective cervixthat spontaneously dilates in the absence of contractionsin the second trimester, resulting in the loss of the preg-nancy. The incidence of cervical insufciency is less than1%; estimates range from 1 in 500 to 1 in 2,000 preg-nancies, accounting for approximately 20% to 25% ofmidtrimester losses (Fox & Chervenak, 2008). Pathophysiology The exact mechanism contributing to cervical insuf- ciency is not known. The incompetent cervix may haveless elastin, less collagen, and greater amounts of smoothmuscle than the normal cervix (Evans, 2007). SeveralCHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 535 theories have been proposed that focus on damage to the cervix as a key component. Cervical insufciency is likely to be the clinical end- point of many pathologic processes, such as congenitalcervical hypoplasia, in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) expo-sure that caused cervical hypoplasia, trauma to cervix(conization, amputation, obstetric laceration, or forced cer-vical dilatation [may occur during elective pregnancy ter-mination]). Other conditions such as previous precipitousbirth, a prolonged second stage of labor, or increased uter-ine volume (multiple gestation, hydramnios) are associatedwith cervical insufciency (Vyas et al., 2006). However, theexact etiology of cervical insufciency is not known. Cervical length also has been associated with cervical insufficiency and subsequently preterm birth. Recentstudies have examined the association between a shortcervical length and the risk of preterm birth. Some havedemonstrated a continuum of risk between a shorter cervixon ultrasound and a higher risk of preterm birth, leadingto the hypothetical argument that women with a shortcervix on ultrasound might benet from cervical cerclage,but there have been conflicting results (Lotgering, 2007;Vidaeff & Ramin, 2007). Therapeutic Management Cervical insufciency may be treated in a variety of ways:bed rest; pelvic rest; avoidance of heavy lifting; or surgi-cally, via a procedure of a cervical cerclage in the secondtrimester. Cervical cerclage involves using a heavy purse-string suture to secure and reinforce the internal os of thecervix (Fig. 19.3). According to the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG) (2003), if a short cervix is iden-tified at or after 20 weeks and no infection (chorioam-nionitis) is present, the decision to proceed with cerclage should be made with caution. There have been limitednumbers of well-designed randomized studies to supportits efcacy. Suture chorioamnionitis are the most common complicationsassociated with cerclage placement, and their incidencevaries widely in relation to the timing and indications for FIGURE19.3 Cervical cerclage.11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM for cer- clage removal is unclear, according to ACOG (2003). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment focuses on obtaining a thorough his-tory to determine any risk factors that might have a bear-ing on this pregnancy\u2014previous cervical trauma, pretermlabor, fetal loss in the second trimester, or previous sur-geries or procedures involving the cervix. History mayreveal a previous loss of pregnancy around 20 weeks. Also be alert for complaints of vaginal discharge or pelvic pressure. Commonly with cervical insufciency thewoman will report a pink-tinged vaginal discharge or an in-crease in pelvic pressure. Cervical dilation also occurs. Ifthis continues, rupture of the membranes, release of am-niotic fluid, and uterine contractions occur, subsequentlyresulting in delivery of the fetus, often before it is viable.536 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK if the woman will be undergoing cerclage. Teach the client and her family about the signs and symptoms ofpreterm labor and the need to report any changes imme-diately. Also reinforce the need for activity restrictions (ifappropriate) and continued regular follow-up. Continu-ing surveillance throughout the pregnancy is important topromote a positive outcome for the family. PLACENTA PREVIA Placenta previa is a bleeding condition that occurs dur- ing the last two trimesters of pregnancy. In placenta previa(literally, \"afterbirth rst\"), the placenta implants overthe cervical os. It may cause serious morbidity and mor-tality to the fetus and mother. It complicates approxi-mately 5 of 1,000 births or 1 in every 200 pregnancies andis associated with potentially serious consequences fromhemorrhage, abruption (separation) of the placenta, oremergency cesarean birth (Joy & Lyon, 2007). Pathophysiology The exact cause of placenta previa is unknown. It is ini-tiated by implantation of the embryo in the lower uterus.With placental attachment and growth, the cervical osmay become covered by the developing placenta. Placen-tal vascularization is defective, allowing the placenta to the myometrium is generally classied according to the degree of coverage or proximity to the internal os, asfollows (Fig. 19.4): Total placenta previa: the internal cervical os is completely covered by the placenta Partial placenta previa: the internal os is partially covered by the placenta Marginal placenta previa: the placenta is at the margin or edge of the internal os Low-lying placenta previa: the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment and is near the internalos but does not reach it Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management depends on the extent of bleed-ing, the amount of placenta over the cervical os, whetherthe fetus is developed enough to survive outside the uterus,the position of the fetus, the mother's parity, and the pres-ence or absence of labor (Zeltzer, 2007). If the mother and fetus are both stable, therapeutic management may involve expectant (\"wait-and-see\") care.This care can be carried out at home or on an antepartalunit in the health care facility. If there is no active bleed-ing and the client has readily available access to reliable The diagnosis of cervical insufficiency remains difcult in many circumstances. The cornerstone of diagnosis is a history of midtrimesterpregnancy loss associated with painless cervicaldilatation without evidence of uterine activity.Take NOTE! Transvaginal ultrasound typically is done around 20 weeks' gestation to determine cervical length and eval-uate for shortening. Cervical shortening occurs from theinternal os outward and can be viewed on ultrasound asfunneling. The amount of funneling can be determinedby dividing funnel length by cervical length. The mostcommon time at which a short cervix or funneling devel-ops is 18 to 22 weeks, so ultrasound screening should beperformed during this interval (Fox & Chervenak, 2008).A cervical length less than 25 mm is abnormal between14 weeks and 24 weeks and may increase the risk ofpreterm labor. Expect the woman (particularly a woman with pelvic pressure, backache, or increased mucoid discharge) toundergo serial transvaginal ultrasound evaluations everyfew days to avoid missing rapid changes in cervical dila-tion or until the trend in cervical length can be character-ized (Bernasko et al., 2006). Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on monitoring the womanvery closely for signs of preterm labor: backache, increasein vaginal discharge, rupture of membranes, and uterinecontractions. Provide emotional support and educationto allay the couple's anxiety about the well-being of theirfetus. Provide preoperative care and teaching as indicated11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 536transportation, can maintain bed rest at home, and can comprehend instructions, expectant care at home is ap-propriate. However, if the client requires continuous careand monitoring and cannot meet the home care require-ments, the antepartal unit is the best environment. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment involves a thorough history, includ- ing possible risk factors, and physical examination. Eval-uate the client closely for these risk factors: Advancing maternal age (more than 35 years) Previous cesarean birth Multiparity Uterine insult or injury Cocaine use Prior placenta previa Infertility treatment Asian ethnic background (incidence is increased in Asian cultural groups) Multiple gestations Previous induced surgical abortion Smoking Previous myomectomy to remove broids Smoking (Ko & Yoon, 2007) Health History and Physical Examination Ask the client if she has any problems associated with bleeding, now or in the recent past. The classical clinicalpresentation is painless, bright-red vaginal bleeding occur-ring during the second or third trimester. The initial bleed-ing usually is not profuse and it ceases spontaneously, only to recur again. The first episode of bleeding occurs (onaverage) at 27 to 32 weeks' gestation. The bleeding isthought to arise secondary to the thinning of the loweruterine segment in preparation for the onset of labor.When the bleeding occurs at the implantation site in thelower uterus, the uterus cannot contract adequately andstop the flow of blood from the open vessels. Typically withCHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 537 normal placental implantation in the upper uterus, minor disruptive placental attachment is not a problem, becausethere is a larger volume of myometrial tissue able to con-tract and constrict bleeding vessels. Assess the client for uterine contractions, which may or may not occur with the bleeding. Palpate the uterus;typically it is soft and nontender on examination. Auscul-tate the fetal heart rate; it commonly is within normalparameters. Fetal distress is usually absent but may occurwhen cord problems arise, such as umbilical cord prolapseor cord compression, or when the client has experiencedblood loss to the extent that maternal shock or placentalabruption has occurred (Oppenheimer, 2007). Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing To validate the position of the placenta, a transvaginal ultrasound is done. In addition, magnetic resonance im-aging may be ordered when preparing for delivery be-cause it allows identication of accreta with invasion of the myo-metrium to the peritoneal covering, causing rupture ofthe uterus) in addition to placenta previa. These pla-cental abnormalities, although rare, carry a very highmorbidity and mortality rate, possibly necessitating a hys-terectomy at delivery. Nursing Management Whether the care setting is in the client's home or in thehealth care facility, the nurse focuses on monitoring thematernal-fetal status, including assessing for signs andsymptoms of vaginal bleeding and fetal distress, and pro-viding support and education to the client and her family,including what events and diagnostic studies are beingperformed. For the majority of women, a cesarean birthwill be planned. Nursing Care Plan 19.1 discusses thenursing process for the woman with placenta previa.FIGURE19.4 Classification of placenta previa.

Sandy had no further active bleeding and did not complain of any abdominal discomfort or tenderness. Shedid complain of occasional \"tightening\" in her stomach. Her abdomen palpated soft. Fetal heart rates were in the 140s withaccelerations with movement. She was placed on bed rest with bathroom privileges. Ultrasound identied a low-lying placentawith a viable, normal-growth fetus. She was diagnosed with placenta previa and admitted for observation and surveillanceof fetal well-being. Her history revealed two previous cesarean births, smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day, and endometr i- tis infection after birth of her last newborn. Additional assessment ndings included painless, bright-red vaginal bleedingwith initial bleeding ceasing spontaneously; irregular, mild, and sporadic uterine contractions; fetal heart rate and maternalvital signs within normal range; fetus in transverse lie; anxiety related to the outcome of pregnancy; and expression of feelings of helplessness. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective tissue perfusion (fetal and maternal) related to blood loss Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will maintain adequate tissue perfusion as evidenced by stable vital signs, decreased blood loss, few or no uterine contractions, normal fetal heart rate patterns and variability, and positive fetal movement Interventions: Maintaining Adequate Tissue Perfusion Establish IV access to allow for administration of fluids, blood, and medications as necessary. Obtain type and cross-match for at least 2 U blood products to ensure availability should bleeding continue. Obtain specimens as ordered for blood studies, such as CBC and clotting studies to establish a baseline and use for future comparison. Monitor output to evaluate adequacy of renal perfusion. Administer IV fluid replacement therapy as ordered to maintain blood pressure and blood volume. Palpate for abdominal tenderness and rigidity to determine bleeding and evidence of uterine contractions. Institute bed rest to reduce oxygen demands. Assess for rupture of membranes to evaluate for possible onset of labor. Avoid vaginal examinations to prevent further bleeding episodes. Complete an Rh titer to identify need for RhoGAM. Avoid nipple stimulation to prevent uterine contractions. Continuously monitor for contractions or PROM to allow for prompt intervention. Administer tocolytic agents as ordered to stall preterm labor. Monitor vital signs frequently to identify possible hypovolemia and infection. Assess frequently for active vaginal bleeding to minimize risk of hemorrhage. Continuously monitor fetal heart rate with electronic fetal monitor to evaluate fetal status. Assist with fetal surveillance tests as ordered to aid in determining fetal well-being. Observe for abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, such as loss of variability, decelerations, tachycardia, to identify fetal distress. Position patient in side-lying position with wedge for support to maximize placental perfusion. Assess fetal movement to evaluate for possible fetal hypoxia. Teach woman to monitor fetal movement to evaluate well-being. Administer oxygen as ordered to increase oxygenation to mother and fetus.11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 538Monitoring Maternal-Fetal Status Assess the degree of vaginal bleeding; inspect the perineal area for blood that may be pooled underneath the woman. Estimate and document the amount of bleeding. Performa peripad count on an ongoing basis, making sure to re-port any changes in amount or frequency to the healthcare provider. If the woman is experiencing active bleed-ing, prepare for blood typing and cross-matching in theevent a blood transfusion is needed.CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 539 Administer pharmacologic agents as necessary. Give Rh immunoglobulin if the client is Rh negative at 28 weeks'gestation. Monitor tocolytic medication if prevention ofpreterm labor is needed. Providing Support and Education Determine the woman's level of understanding aboutplacenta previa and the associated procedures and treat-ment plan. Doing so is important to prevent confusionand gain her cooperation. Provide information aboutthe condition and make sure that all information relatedis consistent with information from the primary careprovider. Explain all assessments and treatment meas-ures as needed. Act as a client advocate in obtaining information for the family. Teach the woman how to perform and record daily fetal movement. This action serves two purposes. One, itprovides valuable information about the fetus. Two, it isan activity that the client can participate in, thereby foster-ing some feeling of control over the situation. If the woman will require prolonged hospitalization or home bed rest, assess the physical and emotional impactthat this may have on her. Evaluate her coping mechanismsto help determine how well she will be able to adjust to andcooperate with the treatment plan. Allow the client to ver-balize her feelings and fears and provide emotional support.Also, provide opportunities for distraction\u2014educationalvideos, arts and crafts, computer games, reading books\u2014and evaluate the client's response. In addition to the emotional impact of prolonged bed rest, thoroughly assess the woman's skin to prevent skinbreakdown and to help alleviate her discomfort secondaryto limited physical activity. Instruct the woman in appro-priate skin care measures. Encourage her to eat a balanceddiet with adequate fluid intake to ensure adequate nutritionNURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to threats to self and fetus Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will experience a decrease in anxiety as evidenced by verbal reports of less anxiety, use of effective coping measures, and calm demeanor Interventions: Minimizing Anxiety Provide factual information about diagnosis and treatment, and explain interventions and the rationale behind them to provide client with understanding of her condition. Answer questions about health status honestly to establish a trusting relationship. Speak calmly to patient and family members to minimize environmental stress. Encourage the use of past effective techniques for coping to promote relaxation and feelings of control. Acknowledge and facilitate the woman's spiritual needs to promote effective coping. Involve the woman and family in the decision-making process to foster self-condence and control over situation. Maintain a presence during stressful periods to allay anxiety. Use the sense of touch if appropriate to convey caring and concern. Encourage talking as a means to release tension.Nursing Care Plan 19.1 (continued) Avoid doing vaginal examinations in the woman with placenta previa. They may disrupt the placenta and cause hemorrhage.Take NOTE! Monitor maternal vital signs and uterine contractil- ity frequently for changes. Have the client rate her level ofpain using an appropriate pain rating scale. Assess fetal heart rates via Doppler or electronic monitoring to detect fetal distress. Monitor the woman'scardiopulmonary status, reporting any difculties in res-pirations, changes in skin color, or complaints of dif-culty breathing. Have oxygen equipment readily availableshould fetal or maternal distress develop. Encourage theclient to lie on her side to enhance placental perfusion. If the woman has an intravenous (IV) line inserted, in- spect the IV site frequently. Alternately, anticipate the in-sertion of an intermittent IV access device such as a salinelock, which can be used if quick access is needed for fluidrestoration and infusion of blood products. Obtain labo-ratory tests as ordered, including complete blood count(CBC), coagulation studies, and Rh status if appropriate.11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 Page 539and hydration and prevent complications associated with urinary and bowel elimination secondary to bed rest. Teach the client and family about any signs and symp- toms that should be reported immediately. In addition,prepare the woman for the possibility of a cesarean birth.The woman must notify her health care provider aboutany bleeding episodes or backaches (may indicate pretermlabor contractions) and must adhere to the prescribed bedrest regimen. To ensure compliance and a positive out-come, she needs to be aware of the purpose of all of theobservations that need to be made. ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE Abruptio placentae is the separation of a normally lo- cated placenta after the 20th week of gestation and prior tobirth that leads to hemorrhage. It is a signicant cause ofthird-trimester bleeding, with a high mortality rate. It oc-curs in about 1% of all pregnancies throughout the world(Gaufberg, 2007), or 1 in 120 pregnancies. The overallfetal mortality rate for placental abruption is 20% to 40%,depending on the extent of abruption. Maternal mor-tality is approximately 6% in abruptio placentae and is re-lated to cesarean birth and/or hemorrhage/coagulopathy(Deering & Satin, 2007). Pathophysiology The etiology of this condition is unknown; however, ithas been proposed that abruption starts with degenerative changes in the small maternal arterioles, resulting in throm-bosis, degeneration of the decidua, and possible rupture ofa vessel. Bleeding from the vessel forms a retroplacentalclot. The bleeding causes increased pressure behind theplacenta and results in separation (Collins, 2007). Fetal blood supply is compromised and fetal distress develops in proportion to the degree of placental separa-tion. This is caused by the insult of the abruption itselfand by issues related to prematurity when early birth isrequired to alleviate maternal or fetal distress. Abruptio placentae is classied according to the ex- tent of separation and the amount of blood loss from thematernal circulation. Classications include: Mild (grade 1): minimal bleeding (less than 500 mL), marginal separation (10% to 20%), tender uterus, nocoagulopathy, no signs of shock, no fetal distress Moderate (grade 2): moderate bleeding (1,000 to 1,500 mL), moderate separation (20% to 50%),continuous abdominal pain, mild shock Severe (grade 3): absent to moderate bleeding (more than 1,500 mL), severe separation (more than 50%),profound shock, agonizing abdominal pain, and devel-opment of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy(DIC) (Gilbert, 2007) Abruptio placentae also may be classied as partial or complete, depending on the degree of separation. Al-540 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK ternately, it can be classied as concealed or apparent, by the type of bleeding (Fig. 19.5). Remember Helen, the pregnant woman with severe abdominal pain? Electronic fetal monitoring revealed uterine hypertonicity with absent fetal heart sounds.Palpation of her abdomen revealed rigidity and extremetenderness in all four quadrants. Her vital signs were asfollows\u2014temperature, afebrile; pulse 94; respirations 22;blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg. might you suspect asthe cause of Helen's abdominal pain? What course of actionwould you anticipate for Helen? Therapeutic Management Treatment of abruptio placentae is designed to assess, control, and restore the amount of blood lost; to providea positive outcome for both mother and newborn; and toprevent coagulation disorders, such as DIC (Box 19.2).Emergency measures include starting two large-bore IVlines with normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution to combat hypovolemia, obtaining blood specimens forevaluating hemodynamic status values and for typing andcross-matching, and frequently monitoring fetal and ma-ternal well-being. After the severity of abruption is deter-mined and appropriate blood and fluid replacement isgiven, cesarean birth is done immediately if fetal distressis evident. If the fetus is not in distress, close monitoringcontinues, with delivery planned at the earliest signs offetal distress. Because of the possibility of fetal bloodloss through the placenta, a neonatal intensive care team should be available during the birth process to assess andtreat the newborn immediately for shock, blood loss, andhypoxia. If the woman develops DIC, treatment focuses on determining the underlying cause of DIC and correctingit. Replacement therapy of the coagulation factors isachieved by transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma along withcryoprecipitate to maintain the circulating volume andprovide oxygen to the cells of the body. Anticoagulanttherapy (low-molecular-weight heparin), packed red volume expanders, suchas plasma protein fraction or albumin, are also used tocombat this serious condition (Bick, 2007). Prompt iden-tication and early intervention are essential for a womanwith acute DIC associated with abruptio placentae totreat DIC and possibly save her life. Nursing Assessment Abruptio placentae is a medical emergency. The nurseplays a critical role in assessing the pregnant woman pre-senting with abdominal pain and/or experiencing vaginalbleeding, especially in a concealed hemorrhage, in which11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 540the extent of bleeding is not recognized. Rapid assess- ment is essential to ensure prompt, effective interventionsto prevent maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.Comparison Chart 19.1 compares placenta previa withabruptio placentae.CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 541 Health History and Physical Examination Begin the health history by assessing the woman for risk factors that may predispose her to abruptio placentae, such as maternal smoking, advanced maternal age (over35 years old), poor nutrition, multiple gestation, excessiveintrauterine pressure caused by hydramnios, hypertension,severe trauma (e.g., auto accident, intimate partner vio-lence), cocaine use, alcohol ingestion, and multiparity(Norwitz & Schorge, 2006; Zeltzer, 2007). Ask the womanabout her previous pregnancies to determine if she has ex-perienced a prior abruption. In addition, be alert for othernotable risk factors, such as male fetal gender, chorioam-nionitis, prolonged premature ruptured membranes (morethan 24 hours), oligohydramnios, preeclampsia, and lowsocioeconomic status (Deering & Satin, 2007). Assess the woman for bleeding. As the placenta sepa- rates from the uterus, hemorrhage ensues. It can be appar-ent, appearing as vaginal bleeding, or it can be concealed.Vaginal bleeding is present in 80% of women diagnosedwith abruptio placentae and may be signicant enough tojeopardize both maternal and fetal health within a shorttime frame. The remaining 20% of abruptions are associ-ated with a concealed hemorrhage and the absence of vagi-nal bleeding. Monitor the woman's level of consciousness,noting any signs or symptoms that may suggest shock.FIGURE 19.5 Classications of abruptio placentae. ( ( abruption with concealedhemorrhage. BOX 19.2 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) DIC is a bleeding disorder characterized by an abnormal reduction in the elements involved in blood clotting resulting from their widespread intravascular clotting(Gilbert, 2007). This disorder can occur secondary toabruptio placentae. Simply put, the clinical and pathologic manifesta- tions of DIC can be described as a loss of balance be-tween the clot-forming activity of thrombin and theclot-lysing activity of plasmin. Therefore, too muchthrombin tips the balance toward the prothrombic stateand the client develops clots. Alternately, too much clot lysis (brinolysis) results from plasmin formation and the client hemorrhages. Small clots form throughout thebody, and eventually the blood-clotting factors are usedup, rendering them unavailable to form clots at sitesof tissue injury. Clot-dissolving mechanisms are also increased, which result in bleeding (possibly severe). DIC can be stimulated by many factors, including sepsis, malignancy, and obstetric conditions such asplacental abruption, missed abortion or retained deadfetus, amniotic fluid embolism, and eclampsia. Laboratory studies that assist in the diagnosis include: Decreased brinogen and platelets Prolonged PT and aPTT Positive D-dimer tests and brin (split) degradation products (objective evidence of the simultaneous formation of thrombin and plasmin) (Furlong & Furlong, 2007) Vital signs can be within normal range, even with signicant blood loss, because a pregnant woman can lose up to 40% of her total bloodvolume without showing signs of shock (Gilbert, 2007).Take NOTE! Assess the woman for complaints of pain, including the type, onset, and location. Ask if she has had any con-tractions. Palpate the abdomen, noting any contractions, Partial 541uterine tenderness, tenseness, or rigidity. Ask if she has noticed any changes in fetal movement and activity. De-creased fetal movement may be the presenting complaint,resulting from fetal jeopardy or fetal death (Oyelese &Ananth, 2006). Assess fetal heart rate and continue tomonitor it electronically.542 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK appropriate dosage of RhoGAM to give to Rh-negative clients Nonstress test\u2014demonstrates ndings bradycardia Biophysical prole\u2014aids in evaluating clients with chronic abruption; a low score (less than 6 points)suggests possible fetal compromise (Collins, 2007) Ultrasound is not useful for making a denitive diag- nosis because the clot is sonographically visible in lessthan 50% of the cases (Zeltzer, 2007). Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with abruptio pla- centae warrants immediate care to provide the best out-come for both mother and fetus. Ensuring Adequate Tissue Perfusion Upon arrival to the facility, place the woman on strict bedrest and in a left lateral position to prevent pressure on thevena cava. This position provides uninterrupted perfu-sion to the fetus. Expect to administer oxygen therapy vianasal cannula to ensure adequate tissue perfusion. Mon-itor oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximetry to evalu-ate the effectiveness of interventions. Obtain maternal vital signs frequently, as often as every 15 minutes as indicated, depending on the woman's statusand amount of blood loss. Observe for changes in vital signssuggesting hypovolemic shock and report them immedi-ately. Also expect to insert an indwelling urinary (Foley)catheter to assess hourly urine output and initiate an IV in-fusion for fluid replacement using a large-bore catheter. Assess fundal height for changes. An increase in size would indicate bleeding. Monitor the amount and char-acteristics of any vaginal bleeding as frequently as every 15to 30 minutes. Be alert for signs and symptoms of DIC,such as bleeding gums, tachycardia, oozing from the IVinsertion site, and petechiae, and administer blood prod-ucts as ordered if DIC occurs. Institute continuous electronic fetal monitoring.

Also observe the tracing for tetanic uterine contractions or changes in fetal heart rate patternssuggesting fetal compromise. Providing Support and Education A woman diagnosed with abruptio placentae may be lled with a sense of heightened anxiety and apprehension, forher own health as well as that of her fetus. Communicateempathy and understanding of the client's experience,and provide emotional support throughout this frighten-ing time. Remain with the couple, acknowledge their emo-tions and fears, and address their spiritual and culturalneeds. Answer their questions about the status of theirfetus openly and honestly, being sure to explain indicatorsof fetal well-being. Provide information about the variousdiagnostic tests, treatments, and procedures that may bedone, including the possible need for a cesarean birth. Depending on the client's status, extent of bleeding, and length of gestation, the fetus may not survive. If thefetus does survive, he or she most likely will require neona-tal intensive care. Assist the client and family to deal withthe loss or with the birth of a newborn in the neonatalintensive care unit. Although abruptio placentae is not a preventable con- dition, client education is important to help reduce the riskfor a recurrence of this condition. Encourage the womanto avoid drinking, smoking, or using drugs during preg-nancy. Urge her to seek early and co ntinuous prenatal care and to receive prompt health care if any signs and symptomsoccur in future pregnancies. Think back to Helen, the pregnant woman described at the beginning of the chapter. She was diagnosed with abruptioplacentae and was prepared for an emergency cesarean birth.On exploration, there was almost a 75% abruption, withapproximately 800 mL of concealed blood between the uterusand the placenta. In addition, she lost an additional 500 mLduring surgery. What in Helen's history may have placedher at increased risk for abruption? What assessments andinterventions would be essential during her postpartumrecovery secondary to her large blood loss? What psychosocialinterventions would be necessary due to her fetal loss? Hyperemesis Gravidarum At least 80% of women experience nausea and vomiting during their pregnancy (Lane, 2007). The term morning sickness is often used to describe this condition when symp- toms are relatively mild. Such symptoms usually disappearafter the rst trimester. This mild form mostly affects thequality of life of the woman and her family, whereas thesevere form\u2014hyperemesis gravidarum\u2014results in dehy-dration, electrolyte imbalance, and the need for hospital-ization (Wilcox & Edelman, 2007).CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 543 Unlike morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum is a complication of pregnancy characterized by persistent,uncontrollable nausea and vomiting that persists beyondthe 20th week of pregnancy, causing weight loss of morethan 5% of prepregnancy body weight, dehydration, meta-bolic acidosis from alkalosis from loss of hy-drochloric acid, and hypokalemia (Lamondy, 2007). Hyperemesis is estimated to occur in approximately 5 per 1,000 pregnancies. The prevalence increases in molarpregnancies and multiple gestations. Its peak incidenceoccurs between 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy, and it usu-ally resolves by week 16 (Ogunyemi, 2007). Every pregnant woman needs to be instructed to report any episodes of severe nausea and vomiting or episodes that extend beyondthe rst trimester.Take NOTE! Pathophysiology Although the exact cause of nausea and vomiting is un-known, its effects\u2014decreased placental blood flow, de-creased maternal blood flow, and acidosis\u2014can threatenthe health of the mother and fetus. Dehydration can alsolead to preterm labor (Lane, 2007). Numerous theoriesabound, but few studies have produced scientic evidenceto identify the etiology of this condition. It is likely thatmultiple factors contribute to it. Elevated levels of hCG are present in all pregnant women during early pregnancy, usually declining after12 weeks. This corresponds to the usual duration of morn-ing sickness. In hyperemesis gravidarum, the hCG levelsare often higher and extend beyond the rst trimester.Symptoms exacerbate the disease. Decreased fluid intakeand prolonged vomiting cause dehydration; dehydrationincreases the serum concentration of hCG, which in turnexacerbates the nausea and vomiting\u2014a vicious cycle. Afew other theories that have been proposed to explain itsetiology include: Endocrine theory\u2014high B6 deciency Psychological theory\u2014psychological stress increases the symptoms Therapeutic Management Conservative management in the home is the rst line oftreatment for the woman with hyperemesis gravidarum.This usually focuses on dietary and lifestyle changes. If conservative management fails to alleviate the client's symptoms and nausea and vomiting continue,11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 543hospitalization is necessary to reverse the effects of severe nausea and vomiting. On admission to the hospital, blood tests are or- dered to assess the severity of the client's dehydration,electrolyte imbalance, ketosis, and malnutrition. Parenteralfluids and drugs are ordered to rehydrate the womanand reduce the symptoms. The first choice for fluid re-placement is generally 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer'ssolution with vitamins (pyridoxine [B6]) and electrolytesadded. Oral food and fluids are withheld for the first 24to 36 hours to allow the GI tract to rest. Antiemeticsmay be administered rectally or intravenously to controlthe nausea and vomiting initially because the woman is considered NPO. Once her condition stabilizes andshe is allowed oral intake, medications may be adminis-tered orally. If the client does not improve after several days of bed rest, \"gut rest,\" IV fluids, and antiemetics, total parenteralnutrition or feeding through a percutaneous endoscopicgastrostomy tube is instituted to prevent malnutrition. The FDA has not approved any drugs for the treat- ment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, but the riskof administration must be balanced against the sequelaeof prolonged starvation and dehydration. Finding a drugthat works for any given client is largely a matter of trialand error. If one drug is ineffective, another class of drugswith a different mechanism of action may help. Prometh-azine (Phenergan) and prochlorperazine (Compazine)are among the older preparations usually tried rst. Ifthey fail to relieve symptoms, newer drugs such as on-544 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK dansetron (Zofran) may be tried. Most drugs are given parenterally or rectally (Lane, 2007) (Drug Guide 19.2). Few women receive complete relief of symptoms from any one therapy. Complementary and alternative medicinetherapies appeal to many to help supplement traditionalones. Some popular therapies include acupressure, mas-sage, therapeutic touch, ginger, and the wearing of Sea-bands to prevent nausea and vomiting. Recent research hasreported a positive effect of using acupressure over theNeiguan point on the wrist by Sea-bands to control nau-sea and vomiting associated with pregnancy (Lane, 2007). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the woman with hyperemesis gravi-darum requires a thorough history and physical examina-tion to identify signs and symptoms associated with thisdisorder. The client is extremely uncomfortable. She mayexperience many hours of lost work productivity andsleep, and hyperemesis may damage family relationships.If hyperemesis progresses untreated, it may cause neuro-logic disturbances, renal damage, retinal hemorrhage, ordeath (Lane, 2007). Laboratory and diagnostic tests aidin determining the severity of the disorder. Health History and Physical Examination Begin the history by asking the client about the onset, du- ration, and course of her nausea and vomiting. Ask herabout any medications or treatments she used and howeffective they were in relieving her nausea and vomiting.Obtain a diet history from the client, including a dietary DRUG GUIDE 19.2 MEDICATIONS USED FOR HYPEREMESIS on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) Symptomatic relief of nausea and vomiting, and motion sickness Acts centrally to inhibit dopamine receptors in the CTZ and peripherally to block vagus nerve stimulation in the GI tract Controls severe nausea and vomiting Blocks serotonin peripherally, centrally, and in the small intestine Prevents nausea and vomitingNursing Implications Be alert for urinary retention, dizziness, hypoten- sion, and involuntary movements.

Note the client's knowledge of nutrition and need for appropriate nutritional intake. Bealert for patterns that may contribute to or trigger her dis-tress. Also ask about any complaints of ptyalism (exces-sive salivation), anorexia, indigestion, and abdominal painor distention. Ask if she has noticed any blood or mucusin her stool. Review the client's history for possible risk factors, such as young age, nausea and vomiting with previouspregnancy, history of intolerance of oral contraceptives,nulliparity, trophoblastic disease, multiple gestation, emo-tional or psychological stress, primigravida status, obesity, hyperthyroidism, andHelicobacter pylori seropositivity (Ogunyemi, 2007). Weigh the client and compare this weight to her weight before shebegan experiencing symptoms and to her prepregnancyweight to estimate the degree of loss. With hyperemesis,weight loss usually exceeds 5% of body mass. Inspect the mucous membranes for dryness and check skin turgor for evidence of fluid loss and dehydration. As-sess blood pressure for changes, such as hypotension, thatmay suggest a fluid volume deficit. Also note any com-plaints of weakness, fatigue, activity intolerance, dizziness,or sleep disturbances. Assess the client's perception of the situation. Note any evidence of depression, anxiety, irritability, mood changes,and decreased ability to concentrate, which can add toher emotional distress (Lamondy, 2007). Determine thewoman's support systems that are available for help. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The results of laboratory and diagnostic tests may provideclues to the severity or etiology of the disorder: These Liver enzymes\u2014elevations aminotransferase (ALT) are usuallypresent CBC\u2014elevated levels of red blood cells and hematocrit, indicating dehydration Urine ketones\u2014positive when the body breaks down fat to provide energy in the absence of inadequate intake Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\u2014increased in the presence of salt and water depletion Urine specic gravity\u2014greater than 1.025, possibly in- dicating concentrated urine linked to inadequate fluidintake or excessive fluid loss Serum electrolytes\u2014decreased levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride resulting from excessive vomitingand loss of hydrochloric acid in stomach Ultrasound\u2014evaluation for molar pregnancy or multi- ple gestation (Wilcox & Edelman, 2007) Nursing Management Nursing management for the client with hyperemesisgravidarum focuses on promoting comfort by controllingCHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 545 the client's nausea and vomiting and promoting adequate nutrition. In addition, the nurse plays a major role in sup-porting and educating the client and her family. Promoting Comfort and Nutrition During the initial period, expect to withhold all oral food and fluids, maintaining NPO status to allow the GI tractto rest. In addition, administer prescribed antiemetics torelieve the nausea and vomiting and IV fluids to replacefluid losses. Monitor the rate of infusion to prevent over-load and assess the IV insertion site to prevent inltrationor infection. Also administer electrolyte replacement ther-apy as ordered to correct any imbalances, and periodicallycheck serum electrolyte levels to evaluate the effectivenessof therapy. Provide physical comfort measures such as hygiene measures and oral care. Pay special attention to the envi-ronment, making sure to keep the area free of pungentodors. As the client's nausea and vomiting subside, grad-ually introduce oral fluids and foods in small amounts.Monitor intake and output and assess the client's toler-ance to the increase in intake. Providing Support and Education Women with hyperemesis gravidarum commonly are fa-tigued physically and emotionally. Many are exhausted,frustrated, and anxious. Offer reassurance that all inter-ventions are directed toward promoting positive pregnancyoutcomes for both the woman and her fetus. Providing in-formation about the expected plan of care may help toalleviate the client's anxiety. Listen to her concerns andfeelings, answering all questions honestly. Educate thewoman and her family about the condition and its treat-ment op tions (Teaching Guidelines 19.1). Teach the client about therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as avoiding stres-sors and fatigue that may trigger nausea and vomiting.Offer ongoing support and encouragement and promoteactive participation in care decisions, thereby empoweringthe client and her family. Attempting to provide the clientwith a sense of control may help her overcome the feel-ing that she has lost control. If necessary, refer the clientto a spiritual advisor or counseling. Also suggest possiblelocal or national support groups that the client may con-tact for additional information. Arrange for possible home care follow-up for the client and reinforce discharge instructions to promoteunderstanding. Collaborate with community resources toensure continuity of care. Gestational Hypertension Gestational hypertension is characterized by hyperten- sion without proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation anda return of the blood pressure to normal postpartum. Pre-viously, gestational hypertension was known as pregnancy-induced hypertension or toxemia of pregnancy, but theseterms are no longer used. Gestational hypertension is clin-11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 545ically characterized by a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more on two occasions at least 6 hours apart (Gibson& Carson, 2007). Gestational hypertension can be differ-entiated from chronic hypertension, which appears be-fore the 20th week of gestation; or hypertension beforethe current pregnancy, which continues after the womangives birth. Gestational hypertension is the second leading cause of maternal death in the United States after thromboem-bolism, accounting for almost 15% of such deaths, andthe most common complication reported during preg-nancy. Hypertension complicates 12% to 20% of preg-nancies and the rate has increased steadily, approximately30% to 40% since 1990, for all ages, races, and ethnicgroups. The highest rates are in women younger than20 or older than 40 (Weismiller, 2007). ACOG (2007a) and the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (2000) have identied a classicationsystem for hypertensive disorders. Hypertension may bea preexisting condition (chronic hypertension) or it maypresent for the rst time during pregnancy (gestationalhypertension). Regardless of its onset, hypertension jeop-ardizes the well-being of the mother as well as the fetus.546 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK The classication of hypertensive disorders in preg- nancy currently consists of four categories: Gestational hypertension: blood pressure elevation (140/90 mm Hg) identied after midpregnancywithout proteinuria Chronic hypertension: hypertension prior to the pregnancy or diagnosed before week 20 of gestation Transient hypertension: hypertension without preeclampsia at the time of birth, during labor, orwithin 24 hours postpartum; resolution within 12 weekspostpartum to normotensive blood pressure levels Chronic hypertension with preeclampsia: chronic hypertension with new proteinuria or exacerbation ofpreviously controlled blood pressure, or proteinuria,thrombocytopenia, or elevated liver enzymes (ACOG,2007; Blackburn, 2007). Gestational hypertension can be classified as pre- eclampsia or eclampsia. Each is associated with spe-cific criteria. Preeclampsia is further categorized asmild or severe. Comparison Chart 19.2 highlights theseclassifications. Pathophysiology Gestational hypertension remains an enigma. The condi- tion can be devastating to both the mother and fetus, andyet the etiology still remains a mystery to medical sciencedespite decades of research. Many theories exist, but nonehave truly explained the widespread pathologic changesthat result in pulmonary edema, oliguria, seizures, throm-bocytopenia, and abnormal liver enzymes (Podymow &August, 2007). Despite the results of several researchstudies, the use of aspirin or supplementation with cal-cium, magnesium, zinc, or antioxidant therapy (vita-min C and E), salt restriction, diuretic therapy, or sh oils has not proved to prevent this destructive condition. The underlying mechanisms involved with this disor- der are vasospasm and hypoperfusion. In addition, en-dothelial injury occurs, leading to platelet adherence, brindeposition, and the presence of schistocytes (fragment ofan erythrocyte). Generalized vasospasm results in elevation of blood pressure and reduced blood flow to the brain, liver, kid-neys, placenta, and lungs. Decreased liver perfusion leadsto impaired liver function and subcapsular hemorrhage.This is demonstrated by epigastric pain and elevated liverenzymes in the maternal serum. Decreased brain perfu-sion leads to small cerebral hemorrhages and symptomsof arterial vasospasm such as headaches, visual distur-bances, hyperactive deep tendon re-flexes (DTRs).

In ad-dition, hemoconcentration blood viscosity andelevated hematocrit (ACOG, 2007a). Therapeutic Management Management of the woman with gestational hyperten-sion varies depending on the severity of her condition andits effects on the fetus. Typically the woman is managedconservatively if she is experiencing mild symptoms. How-ever, if the condition progresses, management becomesmore aggressive. Management for Mild Preeclampsia Conservative strategies for mild preeclampsia are used if the woman exhibits no signs of renal or hepatic dysfunc-tion or coagulopathy. A woman with mild elevations inblood pressure may be placed on bed rest at home. Sheis encouraged to rest as much as possible in the lateral re-cumbent position to improve uteroplacental blood flow,reduce her blood pressure, and promote diuresis. In ad-dition, antepartal visits and diagnostic testing\u2014such asCBC, clotting studies, liver enzymes, and platelet levels\u2014CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 547 increase in frequency. The woman will be asked to mon- itor her blood pressure daily (every 4 to 6 hours whileawake) and report any increased readings; she will alsomeasure the amount of protein found in urine using adipstick and will weigh herself for any weight gain. Dailyfetal movement counts also are implemented. If there isany decrease in movement, the woman needs to be eval-uated by her health care provider that day. A balanced,nutritional diet with no sodium restriction is advised. Inaddition, she is encouraged to drink six to eight 8-ozglasses of water daily. If home management fails to reduce the blood pres- sure, admission to the hospital is warranted and the treat-ment strategy is individualized based on the severity ofthe condition and the gestational age at the time of diag-nosis. During the hospitalization, the woman with mildpreeclampsia is monitored closely for signs and symptomsof severe preeclampsia or impending eclampsia (e.g., per-sistent headache, hyperreflexia). Blood pressure mea-surements are frequently recorded along with daily weights to detect excessive weight gain resulting from edema. Fetalsurveillance is instituted in the form of daily fetal move-ment counts, nonstress testing, and serial ultrasounds toevaluate fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume to con-rm fetal well-being. Expectant management usually con-tinues until the pregnancy reaches term, fetal lung maturityis documented, or complications develop that warrantimmediate birth (Mundy, 2006). Prevention of disease progression is the focus of treat- ment during labor. Blood pressure is monitored frequentlyand a quiet environment is important to minimize therisk of stimulation and to promote rest. IV magnesiumsulfate is infused to prevent any seizure activity, along withMild Preeclampsia Severe Preeclampsia Eclampsia Blood pressure Proteinuria symptoms>140/90 mm Hg after 20 weeks' gestation 300 mg/24 h or greater than 1 + protein on a random dipstickurine sample NoNoMild facial or hand edema Weight gain>160/110 mm Hg >500 mg/24 hours; greater than 3 + on random dipstick No YesHeadache PM Page 547antihypertensives if blood pressure values begin to rise. Calcium gluconate is kept at the bedside in case the mag-nesium level becomes toxic. Continued close monitoringof neurologic status is warranted to detect any signs orsymptoms of hypoxemia, impending seizure activity, orincreased intracranial pressure. An indwelling urinary(Foley) catheter usually is inserted to allow for accuratemeasurement of urine output. Management for Severe Preeclampsia Severe preeclampsia may develop suddenly and bring withit high blood pressure of more than 160/110 mmHg, pro-teinuria of more than 5 g in 24 hours, oliguria of less than400 mL in 24 hours, cerebral and visual symptoms, andrapid weight gain. This clinical picture signals severepreeclampsia, and immediate hospitalization is needed. Treatment is highly individualized and based on dis- ease severity and fetal age. Birth of the infant is the onlycure, because preeclampsia depends on the presence oftrophoblastic tissue. Therefore, the exact age of the fetusis assessed to determine viability. Severe preeclampsia is treated aggressively because hypertension poses a serious threat to mother and fetus.The goal of care is to stabilize the mother-fetus dyad andprepare for birth. Therapy focuses on controlling hyper-tension, preventing seizures, preventing long-term mor-bidity, and preventing maternal, fetal, or newborn death(Weismiller, 2007). Intense maternal and fetal surveillancestarts when the mother enters the hospital and continuesthroughout her stay. The woman in labor with severe preeclampsia typi- cally receives oxytocin to stimulate uterine contractionsand magnesium sulfate to prevent seizure activity. Oxy-tocin and magnesium sulfate can be given simultaneouslyvia infusion pumps to ensure both are administered at theprescribed rate. The client is evaluated closely for mag-nesium toxicity. If at all possible, a vaginal delivery ispreferable to a cesarean birth. PGE2 gel may be used toripen the cervix. A cesarean birth may be performed if theclient is seriously ill. A pediatrician/neonatologist must beavailable in the birthing room to care for the newborn. Anewborn whose mother received high doses of magne-sium sulfate needs to be monitored for respiratory depres-sion, hypocalcemia, and hypotonia (Blackburn, 2007). Management of Eclampsia In the woman who develops an eclamptic seizure, theconvulsive activity begins with facial twitching, followedby generalized muscle rigidity. Respirations cease for theduration of the seizure, resulting from muscle spasms, thuscompromising fetal oxygenation. Coma usually followsthe seizure activity, with respiration resuming. Eclampticseizures are life-threatening emergencies and requireimmediate treatment to decrease maternal morbidity andmortality. As with any seizure, the initial management is to clear the airway and administer adequate oxygen. Positioning548 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK the woman on her left side and protecting her from injury during the seizure are key. Suction equipment must bereadily available to remove secretions from her mouthafter the seizure is over. IV fluids are administered afterthe seizure at a rate to replace urine output and additionalinsensible losses. Fetal heart rate is monitored closely.Magnesium sulfate is administered IV to prevent furtherseizures. Hypertension is controlled with antihyperten-sive medications. After the seizures are controlled, thewoman's stability is assessed and birth via induction orcesarean birth is performed (Blincoe, 2007). If the woman's condition remains stable, she will be transferred to the postpartum unit for care. If she becomesunstable after giving birth, she may be transferred to thecritical care unit for closer observation. Nursing Assessment Preventing complications related to hypertension duringpregnancy requires the use of assessment, advocacy, andcounseling skills. Assessment begins with the accuratemeasurement of the client's blood pressure at each en-counter. In addition, nurses need to assess for subjective complaints that may indicate progression of the disease\u2014visual changes, severe headaches, unusual bleeding orbruising, or epigastric pain (Blincoe, 2007). The signi-cant signs of gestational hypertension\u2014proteinuria andhypertension\u2014occur without the woman's awareness.Unfortunately, by the time symptoms are noticed, gesta-tional hypertension can be severe. The absolute blood pressure (value that validates elevation) of 140/90 mmHg should be obtained on two occasions 6 hours apart tobe diagnostic of gestational hypertension. Proteinuriais dened as 300 mg or more of urinary protein per 24 hours or more than 1 +protein by chemical reagent strip or dipstick of at least two random urine samplescollected at least 6 hours apart with no evidence ofUTI (ACOG, 2007a).Take NOTE! Health History and Physical Examination Take a thorough history during the rst antepartal visit toidentify whether the woman is at risk for preeclampsia.Risk factors include: Primigravida status Chromosomal abnormalities Structural congenital anomalies Multifetal pregnancy History of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy Excessive placental tissue, as is seen in women with GTD11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 548 Chronic stress Family history of preeclampsia (mother or sister) Lower socioeconomic group History of diabetes, hypertension, or renal disease Poor nutrition African-American ethnicity Age extremes (younger than 20 or older than 40) Obesity (Weismiller, 2007) In addition, complete a nutritional assessment that in- cludes the woman's usual intake of protein, calcium, dailycalories, and fluids. Women at risk for preeclampsia require more frequent prenatal visits throughout their pregnancy, and they requireteaching about problems so that they can report thempromptly. Blood pressure must be measured carefully and con- sistently. Obtain all measurements with the woman in thesame position (blood pressure is highest in the sitting po-sition and lowest in the side-lying position) and by usingthe same technique (automated vs. manual). This stan-dardization in position and technique will yield the mostaccurate readings (Weismiller, 2007). Obtain the client's weight (noting gain since last visit), and assess for amount and location of edema.Asking questions such as, \"Do your rings still t on yourngers?\" or \"Is your face puffy when you get up in themorning?\" will help to determine whether fluid retentionis present or if the woman's status has changed since herlast visit.CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 549 1 +pitting edema edema =4-mm skin depression; in 10 to 15 seconds 3 +pitting edema =6-mm depression into skin; lasts more than 1 minute 4 +pitting edema =8-mm depression into skin; lasts 2 to 3 minutes At every antepartal visit, assess the fetal heart rate with a Doppler device. Also check a clean-catch urine specimenfor protein using a dipstick. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Various laboratory tests may be performed to evaluate thewoman's status. Typically these include a CBC, serumelectrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and hepatic enzyme levels.Urine specimens are checked for protein; if levels are 1-2 + or greater, a 24-hour urine collection is completed. Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with gestational hy-pertension focuses on close monitoring of blood pressureand ongoing assessment for evidence of disease progres-sion. Throughout the client's pregnancy, fetal surveillanceis key. Intervening With Preeclampsia The woman with mild preeclampsia requires frequent monitoring to detect changes because preeclampsia canprogress rapidly. Instruct all women in the signs andsymptoms of preeclampsia and urge them to contact theirhealth care professional for immediate evaluation shouldany occur. Typically women with mild preeclampsia can be managed at home if they have a good understanding ofthe disease process, are stable, have no abnormal labora-tory test results, and demonstrate good fetal movement(Teaching Guidelines 19.2). The home care nurse makesfrequent visits and follow-up phone calls to assess thewoman's condition, to assist with scheduling periodicevaluations of the fetus (such as nonstress tests), and toevaluate any changes that might suggest a worsening ofthe woman's condition. Early detection and management of mild preeclampsia is associated with the greatest success in reducing progres-sion of this condition. As long as the client carries out theguidelines of care as outlined by the health care providerand she remains stable, home care can continue to main-tain the pregnancy until the fetus is mature. If disease pro-gression occurs, hospitalization is required. Intervening With Severe Preeclampsia The woman with severe preeclampsia requires hospital- ization. Maintain the client on complete bed rest in theleft lateral lying position. Ensure that the room is dark Although edema is not a cardinal sign of preeclampsia, weight should be monitored frequently to identify sudden gains in a short timespan. Current research relies less on the classic triad ofsymptoms (hypertension, proteinuria, and edema orweight gain) and more on decreased organ perfusion,endothelial dysfunction (capillary leaking and protein-uria), and elevated blood pressure as key indicators(Gibson & Carson, 2007).Take NOTE! If edema is present, assess the distribution, degree, and pitting. Document your ndings and identify whetherthe edema is dependent or pitting. Dependent edema ispresent on the lower half of the body if the client is ambu-latory, where hydrostatic pressure is greatest. It is usuallyobserved in the feet and ankles or in the sacral area if theclient is on bed rest. Pitting edema is edema that leaves a small depression or pit after nger pressure is applied to a swollen area(Gibson & Carson, 2007). Record the depth of pittingdemonstrated when pressure is applied. Although subjec-tive, the following is used to record relative degrees:11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 549and quiet to reduce stimulation. Give sedatives as or- dered to encourage quiet bed rest. The client is at risk forseizures if the condition progresses. Therefore, instituteand maintain seizure precautions, such as padding theside rails and having oxygen, suction equipment, and calllight readily available to protect the client from injury.550 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Closely monitor the client's blood pressure. Adminis- ter antihypertensives as ordered to reduce blood pressure(Drug Guide 19.3). Assess the client's vision and level ofconsciousness. Report any changes and any complaintsof headache or visual disturbances. Offer a high-proteindiet with 8 to 10 glasses of water daily. Monitor the client'sintake and output every hour and administer fluid andelectrolyte replacements as ordered. Assess the womanfor signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema, such ascrackles and wheezing heard on auscultation, dyspnea,decreased oxygen saturation levels, cough, neck vein dis-tention, anxiety, and restlessness (Blincoe, 2007). To achieve a safe outcome for the fetus, prepare the woman for possible testing to evaluate fetal status aspreeclampsia progresses. These may include the nonstresstest, serial ultrasounds to track fetal growth, amniocente-sis to determine fetal lung maturity, Doppler velocimetryto screen for fetal compromise, and biophysical prole toevaluate ongoing fetal well-being (Jung & Erogul, 2007). Other laboratory tests may be performed to monitor the disease process and to determine if it is progressing intoHELLP syndrome. These include liver enzymes such aslactic dehydrogenase (LDH), ALT, and AST; chemistrypanel, and a 24-hoururine collection for protein and creatinine clearance. Administer parenteral magnesium sulfate as ordered to prevent seizures. Assess deep tendon reflexes (DTRs)to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. Clients withpreeclampsia commonly present with hyperreflexia. Se-vere preeclampsia causes changes in the cortex, whichdisrupts the equilibrium of impulses between the cerebralcortex and the spinal cord. Brisk reflexes (hyperreflexia)are the result of an irritable cortex and indicate centralnervous system involvement (Warden & Euerle, 2007). Diminished or absent reflexes occur when the client develops magnesium toxicity. Because magnesium is apotent neuromuscular blockade, the afferent and efferentnerve not relay messages properly and hy pore- flexia develops. Common sites used to assess reflex, triceps reflex, patellar reflex, Achilles reflex,and plantar reflex. Nursing Procedure 19.1 highlights thesteps for assessing the patellar reflex. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a division of the National Institutes ofHealth, published a scale in the early 1990s that, althoughsubjective, is used widely today. It grades reflexes from 0to 4 +. Grades 2 +and 3 +are considered normal, whereas grades 0 and 4 may indicate pathology (Table 19.2).Because these are subjective assessments, to improvecommunication of reflex results, condensed descriptorcategories such as absent, average, brisk, or clonus should be used rather than numeric codes (Gilbert, 2007). Clonus is the presence of rhythmic involuntary con- tractions, most often at the foot or ankle. Sustained clonusTEACHING GUIDELINES 19.2 Teaching for the Woman With Mild Preeclampsia Rest in a quiet environment to prevent cerebral disturbances. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water daily.

Closely assess the clientfor signs of toxicity, which include a respiratory rate of552 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK less than 12 breaths per minute, absence of deep tendon reflexes, and a decrease in urinary output, below 30 mLper hour. Also monitor serum magnesium levels. Althoughexact levels may vary among agencies, serum magnesiumlevels ranging from 4 to 7 mEq/L are considered thera-peutic, whereas levels more than 8 mEq/dL are generallyconsidered toxic. As levels increase, the woman is at riskfor severe problems: 10 mEq/L: possible loss of DTRs 15 mEq/L: possible respiratory depression 25 mEq/L: possible cardiac arrest (Podymow & August, 2007) If signs and symptoms of magnesium toxicity develop, expect to administer calcium gluconate as the antidote. Throughout the client's stay, closely monitor her for signs and symptoms of labor. Perform continuous elec-tronic fetal monitoring to assess fetal well-being. Notetrends in baseline rate and presence or absence of accel-erations or decelerations. Also observe for signs of fetaldistress and report them immediately. Administer gluco-corticoid treatment as ordered to enhance fetal lung ma-turity and prepare for labor induction if the mother'scondition warrants.Nursing Procedure 19.1 ASSESSING THE PATELLAR REFLEX Purpose: To Evaluate for Nervous System Irritability Related to Preeclampsia 1. Place the woman in the supine position (or sitting upright with the legs dangling freely over the side ofthe bed or examination table). 2. If lying supine, have the woman flex her knee slightly.3. Place a hand under the knee to support the leg and locate the patellar tendon. It should be midline justbelow the knee cap. 4. Using a reflex hammer or the side of your hand, strike the area of the patellar tendon rmly and quickly. 5. Note the movement of the leg and foot. A patellar reflex occurs when the leg and foot move (docu-mented as 2+). 6. Repeat the procedure on the opposite leg. Reflex absent, no response detected 0 Hypoactive response, diminished 1Reflex in lower half of normal range 2Reflex in upper half of normal range 3Hyperactive, brisk, clonus present 4Description of Finding Arenson 2007.Nursing Procedure 19.2 TESTING FOR ANKLECLONUS Purpose: To Evaluate for Nervous System Irritability Related to Preeclampsia 1. Place the woman in the supine position. 2. Have the client slightly bend her knee and place a hand under the knee to support it. 3. Dorsiflex the foot briskly and then quickly release it.4. Watch for the foot to rebound smoothly against your hand. If the movement is smooth without any rapidcontractions of the ankle or calf muscle, then clonusis not present; if the movement is jerky and rapid,clonus is present. 5. Repeat on the opposite side. 11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 552Keep the client and family informed of the woman's condition and educate them about the course of treat-ment. Provide emotional support for the client and fam-ily. Severe preeclampsia is very frightening for the clientand her family, and most expectant mothers are very anx-ious about their own health as well as that of the fetus. Toallay anxiety, use light touch to comfort and reassure herthat the necessary actions are being taken. Actively listen-ing to her concerns and fears and communicating themto the health care provider is important in keeping linesof communication open. Offering praise for small accom-plishments can provide positive reinforcement for behav-iors that should be continued. Intervening for Eclampsia The onset of seizure activity identies eclampsia. Typi-cally, eclamptic seizures are generalized and start withfacial twitching. The body then becomes rigid, in a stateof tonic muscular contraction. The clonic phase of theseizure involves alternating contraction and relaxation ofall body muscles. Respirations stop during seizure activ-ity and resume shortly after it ends. Client safety is theprimary concern during eclamptic seizures. If possible,turn the client to her side and remain with her. Make surethat the side rails are up and padded. Dim the lights andkeep the room quiet. Document the time and sequence of events as soon as possible. After the seizure activity has ceased, suctionthe nasopharynx as necessary and administer oxygen.Continue the magnesium sulfate infusion to prevent fur-ther seizures. Ensure continuous electronic fetal monitor-ing, evaluating fetal status for changes. Also assess the clientfor uterine contractions. After the client is stabilized, pre-pare her for the birthing process as soon as possible toreduce the risk of perinatal mortality. Providing Follow-Up Care After delivery of the newborn, continue to monitor theclient for signs and symptoms of preeclampsia/eclampsiafor at least 48 hours. Expect to continue to administermagnesium sulfate infusion for 24 hours to prevent seizureactivity, and monitor serum magnesium levels for toxicity. Assess vital signs at least every 4 hours, along with routine postpartum assessments\u2014fundus, lochia, breasts,bladder, bowels, and emotional state attention when per-forming the fundal assessment and assessing lochia. Mon-itor urine output closely. Diuresis is a positive sign that,along with a decrease in proteinuria, signals resolution ofthe disease. HELLP HELLP is an acronym for hemolysis, elevated liver en-zymes, and low platelets. HELLP syndrome occurs inabout 20% of pregnant women diagnosed with severepreeclampsia. Although it has been reported as early asCHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 553 17 weeks' gestation, most of the time it is diagnosed be- tween 22 and 36 weeks' gestation (White, 2006). HELLPsyndrome leads to an increased maternal risk for devel-oping liver hematoma or rupture, stroke, cardiac arrest,seizure, pulmonary edema, DIC, subendocardial hemor-rhage, adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal damage,sepsis, hypoxic encephalopathy, and maternal or fetal death(White, 2006). Pathophysiology The hemolysis that occurs is termed microangiopathic he-molytic anemia. It is thought to happen when red bloodcells become fragmented as they pass through small, dam-aged blood vessels. Elevated liver enzymes are the result of reduced blood flow to the liver secondary to obstruc-tion from brin deposits. Hyperbilirubinemia and jaundiceresult from liver impairment. Low platelets result fromvascular damage, the result of vasospasm, and plateletsaggregate at sites of damage, resulting in thrombocytope-nia in multiple sites (Basama & Granger, 2007). Therapeutic Management The treatment for HELLP syndrome is based on theseverity of the disease, the gestational age of the fetus, and the condition of the mother and fetus. The client shouldbe admitted or transferred to a tertiary center with a neo-natal intensive care unit. Additional treatments includemagnesium sulfate, antihypertensives, and correction ofthe coagulopathies that accompany HELLP syndrome.After this syndrome is diagnosed and the woman's condi-tion is stable, birth of the infant is indicated. Magnesium sulfate is used prophylactically to prevent seizures. Antihypertensives such as hydralazine or labetalolare given to control blood pressure. Blood componenttherapy\u2014such as fresh-frozen plasma, packed red cells, orplatelets\u2014is transfused to address the microangiopathichemolytic anemia. Birth may be delayed up to 96 hours sothat betamethasone or dexamethasone can be given tostimulate lung maturation in the preterm fetus. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the woman with HELLP is simi-lar to that for the woman with severe preeclampsia. Bealert for complaints of nausea (with or without vomiting),malaise, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, anddemonstrable edema. Perform systematic assessmentsfrequently, as indicated by the woman's condition and re-sponse to therapy. A diagnosis of HELLP syndrome is made based on laboratory test results, including: Low hematocrit that is not explained by any blood loss Elevated LDH (liver impairment) Elevated AST (liver impairment) Elevated ALT (liver impairment)11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 553 Elevated BUN Elevated bilirubin level Elevated uric acid and creatinine levels (renal involvement) Low platelet count (less than 100,000 cells/mm 3) Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman diagnosed withHELLP syndrome is the same as that for the woman withsevere preeclampsia. Closely monitor the client for changesand provide ongoing support throughout this experience. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes is a condition involving glucose in-tolerance that occurs during pregnancy. It is discussed ingreater detail in Chapter 20. Blood Incompatibility Blood incompatibility most commonly involves bloodtype or the Rh factor. Blood type incompatibility, alsoknown as ABO incompatibility, is not as severe a condi-tion as Rh incompatibility. ABO incompatibility warranted. in approximately1 in 1,000 births to Rh-negative women (Salem, 2007). According to the CDC (2007), Rh disease affected 16,000 newborns in the United States annually beforeRhoGAM administration was used to prevent it. Despiteprevention measures, there still are approximately 4,000infants annually affected with Rh disease. Pathophysiology Hemolysis associated with ABO incompatibility is lim-ited to type O mothers with fetuses who have type A or Bblood. In mothers with type A and B blood, naturally oc-curring antibodies are of IgM class, which do not crossthe placenta, whereas in type O mothers, the antibodiesare predominantly IgG in nature. Because A and B anti-gens are widely expressed in a variety of tissues besidesred blood cells, only a small portion of antibodies cross-ing the placenta are available to bind to fetal red cells. Inaddition, fetal red cells appear to have less surface expres-sion of A or B antigen, resulting in few reactive sites\u2014hence the low incidence of signicant hemolysis in affectedneonates. With ABO incompatibility, usually the mother is blood type O, with anti-A and anti-B antibodies in herserum; the infant is blood type A, B, or AB. The incom-patibility arises as a result of the interaction of antibodiespresent in maternal serum and the antigen sites on thefetal red cells. Rh incompatibility is a condition that develops when a woman with Rh-negative blood type is exposed to554 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Rh-positive blood cells and subsequently develops circu- lating titers of Rh antibodies. Individuals with Rh-positiveblood type have the D antigen present on their red cells,whereas individuals with an Rh-negative blood type donot. The presence or absence of the Rh antigen on the redblood cell membrane is genetically controlled. In the United States, 15% of the population lack the Rh surface antigen on the erythrocyte and are consideredRh negative. The vast majority (85%) of individuals areconsidered Rh positive (Alan, 2007). Rh incompatibility most commonly arises with expo- sure of an Rh-negative mother to Rh-positive fetal bloodduring pregnancy or birth, during which time erythro-cytes from the fetal circulation leak into the maternal cir-culation. After a signicant exposure, alloimmunizationor sensitization occurs. As a result, maternal antibodies areproduced against the foreign Rh antigen. Theoretically, fetal and maternal blood does not mix during pregnancy. In reality, however, small placental ac-cidents (transplacental bleeds secondary to minor disease, amniocentesis, placenta placentae allow fetal blood to enter the maternalcirculation and initiate the production of antibodies todestroy Rh-positive blood. The amount of fetal bloodnecessary to produce Rh incompatibility varies. In onestudy, less than 1 mL of Rh-positive blood was shownto result in sensitization of women who are Rh negative(Salem, 2007). Once sensitized, it takes approximately a month for Rh antibodies in the maternal circulation to cross over intothe fetal circulation. In 90% of cases, sensitization occursduring delivery (Blackburn, 2007). Thus, most rstborninfants with Rh-positive blood type are not affected be-cause the short period from rst exposure of Rh-positivefetal erythrocytes to the birth of the infant is insufcientto produce a signicant maternal IgG antibody response. The risk and severity of alloimmune response in- crease with each subsequent pregnancy involving a fetuswith Rh-positive blood. A second pregnancy with an Rh-positive fetus often produces a mildly anemic infant,whereas succeeding pregnancies produce infants with moreserious hemolytic anemia. Nursing Assessment At the rst prenatal visit, determine the woman's blood type and Rh status. Also obtain a thorough health history,noting any reports of previous events involving hemor-rhage to delineate the risk for prior sensitization. Whenthe client's history reveals an Rh-negative mother who maybe pregnant with an Rh-positive fetus, prepare the clientfor an antibody screen (indirect Coombs test) to deter-mine whether she has developed isoimmunity to the Rhantigen. This test detects unexpected circulating anti-bodies in a woman's serum that could be harmful to thefetus (Gilbert, 2007).11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 554Nursing Management If the indirect Coombs test is negative (meaning no anti- bodies are present), then the woman is a candidate forRhoGAM. If the test is positive, RhoGAM is of no valuebecause isoimmunization has occurred. In this case, thefetus is carefully monitored for hemolytic disease. The incidence of isoimmunization has declined dra- matically as a result of prenatal and postnatal RhoGAMadministration after any event in which blood transfermay occur. The standard dose is 300 \u00b5g, which is effec-tive for 30 mL of fetal blood. Rh immunoglobulin helpsto destroy any fetal cells in the maternal circulation beforesensitization occurs, thus inhibiting maternal antibodyproduction. This provides temporary passive immunity,thereby preventing maternal sensitization. The current recommendation is that every Rh-negative nonimmunized woman receives RhoGAM at 28 weeks'gestation and again within 72 hours after giving birth.Other indications for RhoGAM include: Ectopic pregnancy Chorionic Prenatal hemorrhage Molar pregnancy Maternal trauma Percutaneous umbilical sampling Therapeutic or spontaneous abortion Fetal death Fetal surgery (Blackburn, 2007) Despite the availability of RhoGAM and laboratory tests to identify women and newborns at risk, isoimmu-nization remains a serious clinical reality that continuesto contribute to perinatal and neonatal mortality. Nurses,as client advocates, are in a unique position to makesure test results are brought to the health care provider'sattention so appropriate interventions can be initiated.In addition, nurses must stay abreast of current literatureand research regarding isoimmunization and its man-agement. Stress to all women that early prenatal carecan help identify and prevent this condition. Since Rhincompatibility is preventable with the use of RhoGAM,prevention remains the best treatment. Nurses canmake a tremendous impact to ensure positive outcomesfor the greatest possible number of pregnancies througheducation. Amniotic Fluid Imbalances Amniotic fluid develops from several maternal and fetalstructures, including the amnion, chorion, maternal blood,fetal lungs, GI tract, kidneys, and skin. Any alteration inone or more of the various sources will alter the amount ofamniotic fluid. Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios aretwo imbalances associated with amniotic fluid.CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 555 POLYHYDRAMNIOS Polyhydramnios , also called hydramnios, is a condi- tion in which there is too much amniotic fluid (morethan 2,000 mL) surrounding the fetus between 32 and36 weeks. It occurs in approximately 3% of all pregnan- cies and is associated with fetal anomalies of development(Rajiah & Banerjee, 2007). It is associated with poor fetaloutcomes because of the increased incidence of pretermbirths, fetal malpresentation, and cord prolapse. There are several causes of polyhydramnios. Gener- ally, too much fluid is being produced, there is a problemwith the fluid being taken up, or both. It can be associ-ated with maternal disease and fetal anomalies, but it canalso be idiopathic in nature. Therapeutic Management Treatment may include close monitoring and frequentfollow-up visits with the health care provider if the hydram-nios is mild to moderate. In severe cases in which the woman is in pain and experiencing shortness of breath,an amniocentesis or articial rupture of the membranesis done to reduce the fluid and the pressure. Removal offluid by amniocentesis is only transiently effective. A non-invasive treatment may involve the use of a prostaglandinsynthesis inhibitor (indomethacin) to decrease amnioticfluid volume by decreasing fetal urinary output, but thismay cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arterio-sus (Boyd & Carter, 2007). Nursing Assessment Begin the assessment with a thorough history, being alertto risk factors such as maternal diabetes or multiple ges-tation. Review the maternal history for information aboutpossible fetal anomalies, including fetal esophageal orintestinal atresia, neural tube defects, chromosomal de-viations, fetal hydrops, central nervous system or cardio-vascular anomalies, and hydrocephaly. Determine the gestational age of the fetus and meas- ure the woman's fundal height. With hydramnios, thereis a discrepancy between fundal height and gestationalage, or a rapid growth of the uterus is noted. Assess thewoman for complaints of discomfort in her abdomen,such as being severely stretched and tight. Also note anyreports of uterine contractions, which may result fromoverstretching of the uterus. Assess for shortness of breathresulting from pressure on her diaphragm and inspect herlower extremities for edema, which results from increasedpressure on the vena cava. Palpate the abdomen and obtain fetal heart rate. Often the fetal parts and heart rate are difcult to obtainbecause of the excess fluid present. Prepare the woman for possible diagnostic testing to evaluate for the presence of possible fetal anomalies.An ultrasound usually is done to measure the pockets of11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 555amniotic fluid to estimate the total volume. In some cases, ultrasound also is helpful in nding the etiology ofpolyhydramnios, such as multiple pregnancy or a fetalstructural anomaly. Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with polyhydram- nios focuses on ongoing assessment and monitoring forsymptoms of abdominal pain, dyspnea, uterine contrac-tions, and edema of the lower extremities. Explain to thewoman and her family that this condition can cause heruterus to become overdistended and may lead to pretermlabor and preterm rupture of membranes. Outline thesigns and symptoms of both conditions and instruct thewoman to contact her health care provider if they dooccur. If a therapeutic amniocentesis is performed, assistthe health care provider and monitor maternal and fetalstatus throughout for any changes. OLIGOHYDRAMNIOS Oligohydramnios is a decreased amount of amniotic fluid (less than 500 mL) between 32 weeks and 36 weeks'gestation. It occurs in 5% to 8% of all pregnancies. Oligo-hydramnios may result from any condition that preventsthe fetus from making urine or blocks it from going intothe amniotic sac. This condition puts the fetus at an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality (Blackburn, 2007). Re-duction in amniotic fluid reduces the ability of the fetusto move freely without risk of cord compression, whichincreases the risk for fetal death and intrapartal hypoxia. Therapeutic Management The woman with oligohydramnios can be managed on an outpatient basis with serial ultrasounds and fetal surveil-lance through nonstress testing and biophysical proles.As long as fetal well-being is demonstrated with frequenttesting, no intervention is necessary. If fetal well-being iscompromised, however, birth is planned along with am-nioinfusion (the transvaginal infusion of crystalloid fluidto compensate for the lost amniotic fluid). The fluid isintroduced into the uterus through an intrauterine pres-sure catheter. The infusion is administered in a controlledfashion to prevent overdistention of the uterus. Amnio-infusion is thought to improve abnormal fetal heart ratepatterns, decrease cesarean births, and possibly mini-mize the risk of neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome (Norwitz & Schorge, 2006). Nursing Assessment Review the maternal history for factors associated with oligohydramnios, including:556 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Uteroplacental insufciency Premature rupture of membranes prior to labor onset Hypertension of pregnancy Maternal diabetes Intrauterine growth restriction Postterm pregnancy Fetal renal agenesis Polycystic kidneys Urinary tract obstructions Assess the client for complaints of fluid leaking from the vagina. Leaking of amniotic fluid from the vagina oc-curs with rupture of the amniotic sac. Leaking in con-junction with a uterus that is small for expected dates ofgestation also suggests oligohydramnios. Unfortunately,the woman may not present with any symptoms. Typi-cally, the reduced volume of amniotic fluid is identiedon ultrasound. Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with oligohydram-nios involves continuous monitoring of fetal well-beingduring nonstress testing or during labor and birth byidentifying nonreassuring patterns on the fetal monitor.Variable decelerations indicating cord compression arecommon. Changing the woman's position might betherapeutic in altering this fetal heart rate pattern. Afterthe birth, evaluate the newborn for signs of postmaturity,congenital anomalies, and respiratory difculty. Assist with amnioinfusion as indicated and continue to assess the woman's vital signs, contraction status, andfetal heart rate throughout the procedure. Provide com-fort measures such as changing the bed linens and thewoman's bed clothes frequently because of the constantleakage of fluid from the vagina. Also provide frequentperineal care during the infusion. Multiple Gestation Multiple gestation is dened as more than one fetus being born to a pregnant woman. This includes twins,triplets, and higher-order multiples such as quadrupletson up. In the past two decades, the number of multiplegestations in the United States has jumped dramaticallybecause of the widespread use of fertility drugs, olderwomen having babies, and assisted reproductive technolo-gies to treat infertility. About one third of live births from assisted reproductive technology result in more than oneinfant, and twins represent 85% of those multiple-birthchildren (Grainger, Frazier, & Rowland, 2006). In theUnited States, the overall prevalence of twins is approxi-mately 12 per 1,000, and two thirds are dizygotic (Zach& Pramanik, 2007). The increasing number of multiplegestations is a concern because women who are expect-ing more than one infant are at high risk for preterm labor,hydramnios, prematurity, respiratory birth asphyxia/perinatal depression, congenitalanomalies (central nervous system, cardiovascular, andGI defects), twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (transfu-sion of blood from one twin [i.e., donor] to the other twin[i.e., recipient]), intrauterine growth restriction, and be-coming conjoined twins (Zach & Pramanik, 2007). The two types of twins are monozygotic and dizygotic (Fig. 19.6). Monozygotic twins develop when a single,fertilized ovum splits during the rst 2 weeks after concep-tion. Monozygotic twins also are called identical twins. Two sperm fertilizing two ova produce dizygotic twins,which are called fraternal twins. Separate amnions, chori-ons, and are formed in dizygotic twins. Tripletscan be monozygotic, dizygotic, or trizygotic. Therapeutic Management When a multiple gestation is conrmed, the woman isfollowed with serial ultrasounds to assess fetal growthpatterns and development. Biophysical proles along withnonstress tests are ordered to determine fetal well-being.Many women are hospitalized in late pregnancy to preventpreterm labor and receive closer surveillance. During theintrapartum period the woman is closely monitored, witha perinatal team available to assist after birth. Operativedelivery is frequently needed due to fetal malpresentation. Nursing Assessment Obtain a health history and physical examination. Be alertfor complaints of fatigue and severe nausea and vomiting.Assess the woman's abdomen and fundal height. Typicallywith a multiple gestation the uterus is larger than expectedbased on the estimated date of birth. Laboratory test re-sults may reveal anemia. Prepare the woman for ultra-sound, which typically conrms the diagnosis of a multiplegestation.CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 557 Nursing Management During the prenatal period, care focuses on providing ed- ucation and support for the woman in areas of nutrition,increased rest periods, and close observation for pregnancycomplications\u2014anemia, excessive weight gain, protein-uria, edema, vaginal bleeding, and hypertension. Instructthe woman to be alert for and report immediately anysigns and symptoms of preterm labor\u2014contractions, uter-ine cramping, low back ache, increase in vaginal discharge,loss of mucus plug, pelvic pain, and pressure. With the onset of labor, expect to monitor fetal heart rates continuously. Prepare the woman for an ultrasoundto assess the presentation of each fetus to determine thebest delivery approach. Ensure that extra nursing staff andthe perinatal team are available for any birth or newborncomplications. After the babies are born, closely assess the woman for hemorrhage by frequently assessing uterine involution.Palpate the uterine fundus and monitor the amount andcharacteristics of lochia. Throughout the entire pregnancy, birth, and hospi- tal stay, inform and support the woman and her family.Encourage them to ask questions and verbalize any fearsand concerns. Premature Rupture of Membranes Premature rupture of membranes (PROM ) is the rupture of the bag of waters before the onset of true labor.There are a number of associated conditions and compli-cations, such as infection, prolapsed cord, abruptio placen-tae, and preterm labor. This is the single most commondiagnosis associated with preterm births (Gilbert, 2007). PROM occurs in approximately 12% of all births (ACOG, 2007b). If prolonged (greater than 24 hours),the woman's risk for infection (chorioamnionitis, en-dometritis, and Placenta ABFIGURE 19.6 Multiple gestation with twins. ( A) Dizygotic twins, where each fetus has its ownplacenta, amnion, and chorion. (B) Monozygotic twins, where the one placenta, twoamnions, and one chorion.11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 557this risk continues to increase as the duration of rupture time increases. The time interval from rupture of mem-branes to the onset of regular contractions is termed thelatent period. The terminology pertaining to PROM can be confus- ing. PROM is rupture of the membranes prior to the onsetof labor and is used appropriately when referring to awoman who is beyond 37 weeks' gestation, has presentedwith spontaneous rupture of the membranes, and is not inlabor. Related terms include preterm ture of membranes prior to the onset of labor in a womanwho is lessthan 37 weeks of gestation. Perinatal risks associated with PPROM may stem from immaturity,including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricularhemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, and necrotizingenterocolitis. The exact cause of PROM is not known. In many cases, PROM occurs spontaneously. Therapeutic Management Treatment of PROM typically depends on the gestationalage. Under no circumstances is an unsterile digital cervi-cal examination done until the woman enters active labor,to minimize infection exposure. If the fetal lungs are ma-ture, induction of labor is initiated. PROM is not a loneindicator for surgical birth. If the fetal lungs are imma-ture, expectant management is carried out with adequatehydration, reduced physical activity, pelvic rest, and closeobservation for possible infection, such as with frequentmonitoring of vital signs and laboratory test results (e.g.,the white blood cell count). Corticosteroids may be givento enhance fetal lung maturity if lungs are immature, al-though this remains controversial. Recent studies haveshown clear benets of antibiotics to decrease neonatalmorbidity associated with PPROM (ACOG, 2007b). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment focuses on obtaining a complete healthhistory and performing a physical examination to deter-mine maternal and fetal status. An accurate assessment ofthe gestational age and knowledge of the maternal, fetal,and neonatal risks are essential to appropriate evaluation,counseling, and management of women with PROM andPPROM. Health History and Physical Examination Review the maternal history for risk factors such as infec-tion, increased uterine size (hydramnios, macrosomia,multifetal gestation), uterine and fetal anomalies, lower so-cioeconomic status, STIs, cervical insufciency, vaginalbleeding, and cigarette smoking during pregnancy. Askabout any history or current symptoms of UTI (frequency,urgency, dysuria, or flank pain) or pelvic or vaginal infec-tion (pain or vaginal discharge).558 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Assess for signs and symptoms of labor, such as cramping, pelvic pressure, or back pain. Also assess hervital signs, noting any signs indicative of infection such asfever and elevated white blood cell count (more than18,000 cells/mm 3) (Jazayeri & Galan, 2007). Institute continuous electronic fetal heart rate mon- itoring to evaluate fetal well-being. Conduct a vaginal ex-amination to ascertain the cervical status in PROM. IfPPROM exists, a sterile speculum examination (wherethe examiner inspects the cervix but does not palpate it)is done rather than a digital cervical examination becauseit may diminish latency (period of time from rupture ofmembranes to birth) and increase newborn morbidity(Cunningham et al., 2005). Observe the characteristics of the amniotic fluid. Note any evidence of meconium, or a foul odor. When meco-nium is present in the amniotic fluid, it typically indicatesfetal distress related to hypoxia. Meconium stains thefluid yellow to greenish brown, depending on the amountpresent. A foul odor of amniotic fluid indicates infection.Also observe the amount of fluid. A decreased amount ofamniotic fluid reduces the cushioning effect, thereby mak-ing cord compression a possibility. Key assessments aresummarized in Box 19.3. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing To diagnose PROM or PPROM, several procedures maybe used: the Nitrazine test, fern test, or ultrasound. Afterthe insertion of a sterile speculum, a sample of the fluid BOX 19.3 Key Assessments With Premature Rupture of Membranes For the woman with PROM, the following assessments are essential: Determining the date, time, and duration of membrane rupture by client interview Ascertaining gestational age of the fetus based on date of mother's LMP, fundal height, and ultrasound dating Questioning the woman about possible history of or recent UTI or vaginal infection that might have contributed to PROM Assessing for any associated labor symptoms, such as back pain or pelvic pressure Assisting with or performing diagnostic tests to validate leakage of fluid, such as Nitrazine test, \"ferning\" onslide, and ultrasound Continually assessing for signs of infection including Elevation of maternal temperature and pulse rate Abdominal/uterine tenderness Fetal tachycardia more than 160 bpm Elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein Cloudy, foul-smelling amniotic fluid11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 558in the vaginal area is obtained. With a Nitrazine test, pH of the fluid is tested; amniotic fluid is more basic (7.0) thannormal vaginal secretions (4.5). Nitrazine paper turns bluein the presence of amniotic fluid. However, false-positiveresults can occur if blood, urine, semen, or antisepticchemicals are also present; all will increase the pH. For the fern test, a sample of vaginal fluid is place on a slide to be viewed directly under a microscope. Amni-otic fluid will develop a fern-like pattern when it dries be-cause of sodium chloride crystallization. If both of thesetests are inconclusive, a transvaginal ultrasound can alsobe used to determine whether membranes have rupturedby demonstrating a decreased amount of amniotic fluid(oligohydramnios) in the uterus (Jazayeri & Galan, 2007). Other laboratory and diagnostic tests that may be used include: Urinalysis and urine culture for UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria Cervical test or culture for chlamydia or gonorrhea Vaginal culture for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis Vaginal introital/rectal culture for group B streptococcus Nursing Management Nursing management for the woman with PROM or PPROM focuses on preventing infection and identifyinguterine contractions. The risk for infection is great be-cause of the break in the amniotic fluid membrane and itsclose proximity to vaginal bacteria. Therefore, monitormaternal vital signs closely. Be alert for a temperature el-evation or an increase in pulse, which could indicate in-fection. Also monitor the fetal heart rate continuously,reporting any fetal tachycardia (which could indicate amaternal infection) or variable decelerations (suggestingcord compression). If variable decelerations are present,anticipate amnioinfusion based on agency policy. Evaluatethe results of laboratory tests such as a CBC. An elevationin white blood cells would suggest infection. Administerantibiotics if ordered. Encourage the woman and her partner to verbalize their feelings and concerns. Educate them about the pur-pose of the protective membranes and the implications ofearly rupture. Keep them informed about planned inter-ventions, including potential complications and requiredtherapy. As appropriate, prepare the woman for inductionor augmentation of labor as appropriate if she is near term. If labor doesn't start within 48 hours, the woman with PPROM may be discharged home on expectant manage-ment, which may include: Antibiotics if cervicovaginal cultures are positive Activity restrictions Education about signs and symptoms of infection and when to call with problems or concerns (TeachingGuidelines 19.3)CHAPTER 19 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AT RISK: PREGNANCY -RELATED COMPLICATIONS 559 Frequent fetal testing for well-being Ultrasound every 3 to 4 weeks to assess amniotic fluid levels Possible corticosteroid treatment depending on gestational age Daily kick counts to assess fetal well-being /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Identifying risk factors early on and ongoing through- out the pregnancy is important to ensure the best out-come for every pregnancy. Risk assessment shouldstart with the rst prenatal visit and continue with sub-sequent visits. /H18546The three most common causes of hemorrhage early in pregnancy (rst half of pregnancy) are spontaneousabortion, ectopic pregnancy, and GTD. /H18546Ectopic pregnancies occur in about 1 in 50 pregnan- cies and have increased dramatically during the pastfew decades. /H18546Having a molar pregnancy results in the loss of the preg- nancy and the possibility of developing choriocarcinoma,a chronic malignancy from the trophoblastic tissue. /H18546The classic clinical picture presentation for placenta previa is painless, bright-red vaginal bleeding occur-ring during the third trimester.TEACHING GUIDELINES 19.3 Teaching for the Woman With PPROM Monitor your baby's activity by performing fetal kick counts daily. Check your temperature daily and report any tem-perature increases to your health care provider. Watch for signs related to the beginning of labor. Report any tightening of the abdomen or contractions. Avoid any touching or manipulating of yourbreasts, which could stimulate labor. Do not insert anything into your vagina or vaginal area. Maintain any specific activity restrictions as recommended. Wash your hands thoroughly after using the bath-room and make sure to wipe from front to backeach time. Keep your perineal area clean and dry. Take your antibiotics as directed if your health careprovider has prescribed them. Call your health care provider with changes in yourcondition, including fever, uterine tenderness,feeling like your heart is racing, and foul-smellingvaginal discharge. 11223-19_UT7-CH19.qxd 8/4/08 3:01 PM Page 559/H18546Treatment of abruptio placentae is designed to assess, control, and restore the amount of blood lost; to pro-vide a positive outcome for both mother and infant;and to prevent coagulation disorders. /H18546DIC can be described in simplest terms as a loss of bal- ance between the clot-forming activity of thrombinand the clot-lysing of plasmin. /H18546Hyperemesis gravidarum is a complication of preg- nancy characterized by persistent, uncontrollable nau-sea and vomiting before the 20th week of gestation. /H18546Gestational hypertension is the leading cause of mater- nal death in the United States and the most commoncomplication reported during pregnancy. /H18546HELLP is an acronym for hemolysis, elevated liver en- zymes, and low platelets. /H18546Rh incompatibility is a condition that develops when a woman of Rh-negative blood type is exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood cells and subsequently developscirculating titers of Rh antibodies. /H18546Hydramnios occurs in approximately 3 to 4% of all pregnancies and is associated with fetal anomalies ofdevelopment. /H18546Nursing care related to the woman with oligohydram- nios involves continuous monitoring of fetal well-beingduring nonstress testing or during labor and birth byidentifying nonreassuring patterns on the fetal monitor. /H18546The increasing number of multiple gestations is a con- cern because women who are expecting more than oneinfant are at high risk for preterm labor, hydramnios,hyperemesis gravidarum, anemia, preeclampsia, andantepartum hemorrhage. /H18546Nursing care to centers on infection pre- vention and identication of preterm labor contractions. /H18546Early identication of preterm labor would allow for appropriate interventions that may prolong the preg-nancy, such as transferring the woman to a facility witha neonatal intensive care unit for prenatal care, admin-istering glucocorticoids to the mother to promote fetallung maturity, and giving appropriate antibiotics totreat infections to arrest the labor process. /H18546It is essential that nurses teach all pregnant women how to detect the early symptoms of preterm labor andwhat to do if they experience contractions or crampingthat does not go away.

Ideally thepregnant woman is free of any conditions that can affecta pregnancy, but in reality many women enter pregnancywith a multitude of health-related or psychosocial issuesthat can have a negative impact on the outcome. Many pregnant women express the wish, \"I hope my baby is born healthy.\" Nurses can play a major rolein helping this become a reality by educating womenbefore they become pregnant. Conditions such as dia-betes, cardiac and respiratory disorders, anemias, andspecific infections frequently can be controlled throughclose prenatal management so that their impact on preg-nancy is minimized. Nurses can provide pregnancy-prevention strategies when counseling teenagers. Meet-ing the developmental needs of pregnant adolescents is achallenge. Finally, lifestyle choices can place many womenat risk during pregnancy, and nurses need to remain non-judgmental in working with these special populations.Lifestyle choices such as use of alcohol, nicotine, andillicit substances during pregnancy are addressed in aNational Health goal. Chapter 19 described pregnancy-related conditions that place the woman at risk. This chapter addresses com-mon conditions that can have a negative impact on thepregnancy and special populations at risk, outlining ap- propriate nursing assessment and management for eachcondition or situation. The unique skills of nurses, in con-junction with the other members of the health care team, can increase the potential for a positive outcome in manyhigh-risk pregnancies. Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by a relative lack of insulin or absence of the hormone, whichis necessary for glucose metabolism. The chronic hyper-glycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage,dysfunction, and failure of the eyes, kidneys, nerves,heart, and blood vessels. The prevalence of diabetes in theUnited States is increasing at an alarming rate, alreadyreaching epidemic proportions. A contributing factor tothese increasing rates is the incidence of obesity. Diabetesis a common endocrine disorder, affecting up to 14% ofall pregnancies (American Diabetes Association [ADA],2007a). Diabetes commonly is classied based on disease eti- ology (ADA, 2007a). These groups include: Type 1 diabetes : absolute insulin deciency (due to an autoimmune process); usually appears before theage of 30 years; approximately 10% of those diagnosedhave type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes : insulin resistance or deciency (related to obesity, sedentary lifestyle); diagnosedprimarily in adults older than 30 years of age but isnow being seen in children; accounts for 90% of alldiagnosed cases. Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance : characterized by hyperglycemia at a level lower than what qualies as a diagnosis of diabetes (fast-ing blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dL;blood glucose level between 140 and 199 mg/dL after a2-hour glucose tolerance test, respectively); symptomsof diabetes are absent; newborns are at risk for beinglarge for gestational age (LGA) Gestational diabetes mellitus : glucose intolerance with its onset during pregnancy or rst detected inpregnancy During pregnancy, diabetes typically is categorized into two groups: pregestational diabetes (alteration in carbohydrate metabolism identied before conception),which includes women with type 1 or type 2 disease; andgestational diabetes, which develops during pregnancy.P9.Identify the impact of pregnancy on a woman over the age of 35. 10.Develop a plan of care for the pregnant woman who is HIV positive. 11.Examine the effects of substance abuse during pregnancy.LEARNING OBJECTIVES (continued) Increase abstinence from alcohol, cigarettes, andillicit drugs among pregnant womenIncrease in reportedabstinence in the pastmonth from substances bypregnant womenAlcohol from a baseline of86% to drinking 99% to 100%Cigarette drugs from a baselineof 98% to 100%Will help to focus attention on measures for reducing substanceexposure and use, therebyminimizing the effects of thesesubstances on the fetus andnewborn USDHHS, 2000.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 Objective Signicance11223-20_CH20.qxd 3:03 PM Page 565Pregestational diabetes complicates 0.2% to 0.3% of all pregnancies and affects more than 15,000 women annu-ally. Gestational diabetes occurs in approximately 8% of allpregnant women, and those rates are higher among womenof color. It is associated with either neonatal complicationssuch as macrosomia, hypoglycemia, and birth trauma ormaternal complications such as preeclampsia and cesareanbirth. Gestational diabetes complicates more than 200,000pregnancies annually in the United States and accounts for90% of diabetic pregnancies (ADA, 2007a). Before the discovery of insulin in 1922, most women with diabetes were infertile or experienced spontaneousabortion (March of Dimes, 2007b). Over the past severaldecades, great strides have been made in improving theoutcomes of pregnancy in women with diabetes, but thischronic metabolic disorder remains a high-risk conditionduring pregnancy. A favorable outcome requires com-mitment on the woman's part to comply with frequentprenatal visits, dietary restrictions, self-monitoring of bloodglucose levels, frequent laboratory tests, intensive fetalsurveillance, and perhaps hospitalization. Pathophysiology With diabetes, there is a deciency of or resistance to in-sulin. This alteration interferes with the body's ability toobtain essential nutrients for fuel and storage. If a preg-nant woman has pregestational diabetes or develops ges-tational diabetes, the profound metabolic alterations thatoccur during pregnancy and that are necessary to supportthe growth and development of fetus can be affected. Consider THIS! Scott and I had been busy all day setting up the new crib and nursery, and we finally sat down to rest. Iwas due any day, and we had been putting this offuntil we had a long weekend to complete the task. Iwas excited to think about all the frilly pinks thatdecorated her room. I was sure that my new daughterwould love it as much as I loved her already. A fewdays later I barely noticed any fetal movement, but I thought that she must be as tired as I was by thispoint. That night I went into labor and kept looking at the worried faces of the nurses and the midwife in atten-dance. I had been diagnosed with gestational diabetesa few months ago and had tried to follow the instruc-tions regarding diet and exercise, but old habits arehard to change when you are 38 years old. I was -nally told after a short time in the labor unit that theycouldn't pick up a fetal heartbeat and an ultrasoundwas to be done\u2014still no heartbeat was detected. Scottand I were nally told that our daughter was a still-born. All I could think about was that she would neverget to see all the pink colors in the nursery. . . Maternal metabolism is directed toward supplying ad- equate nutrition for the fetus. In pregnancy, placental hor-mones cause insulin resistance at a level that tends toparallel the growth of the fetoplacental unit. As the placentagrows, more placental hormones are secreted. Human pla-cental lactogen (hPL) and growth hormone (somatotropin)increase in direct correlation with the growth of placentaltissue, rising throughout the last 20 weeks of pregnancy andcausing insulin resistance. Subsequently, insulin secretionincreases to overcome the resistance of these two hor-mones. In the nondiabetic pregnant woman, the pancreascan respond to the demands for increased insulin produc-tion to maintain normal glucose levels throughout the preg-nancy (Cypryk et al., 2007). However, the woman withglucose intolerance or diabetes during pregnancy cannotcope with changes in metabolism resulting from insufcientinsulin to meet the needs during gestation. Over the course of pregnancy, insulin resistance changes. It peaks in the last trimester to provide more nu-trients to the fetus. The insulin resistance typically resultsin postprandial hyperglycemia, although some womenalso have an elevated fasting blood glucose level (Homko& Reece, 2006). With this increased demand on the pan-creas in late pregnancy, women with diabetes or glucoseintolerance cannot accommodate the increased insulin de-mand; glucose levels rise as a result of insulin deciency,leading to hyperglycemia. Subsequently, the mother andher fetus can experience major problems (Table 20.1). Therapeutic Management Preconception counseling is key for the woman with preges-tational diabetes (the alteration in carbohydrate metabolismis identied before conception) to ensure that her diseasestate is stable. The goals of preconception care are to: Integrate the woman into the management of her diabetes Achieve the lowest glycosylated hemoglobin A1C test results without excessive hypoglycemia Ensure effective contraception until stable glycemia is achieved Identify and evaluate long-term diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardio-vascular disease, and hypertension (ADA, 2007b) Excellent control of blood glucose, as evidenced by normal fasting blood glucose levels and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level (a measurement of the average glucose levels over the past 100 to 120 days), iscrucial to achieve the best pregnancy outcome. A glyco-sylated hemoglobin level of less than 7% indicates goodcontrol; a value of more than 8% indicates poor controland warrants intervention (ADA, 2007b). Preconception counseling also is important in help- ing to reduce the risk of congenital malformation. Themost common malformations associated with diabetesoccur in the renal, cardiac, skeletal, and central nervoussystems. Since these defects occur by the eighth week ofgestation, preconception counseling is critical. The rateof congenital anomalies in women with pregestational566 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 566diabetes can be reduced if excellent glycemic control is achieved at the time of conception (Varughese et al.,2007). This information needs to be stressed with alldiabetic women contemplating a pregnancy. In addition, the woman with pregestational diabetes needs to be evaluated for complications of diabetes. Thisevaluation should be part of baseline screening and con-tinuing assessment during pregnancy. Therapeutic management for the woman with gesta- tional diabetes mellitus (dened as glucose intolerance withits onset during pregnancy or rst detected during preg-nancy) focuses on tight glucose control. The ADA (2007b)recommends maintaining a fasting blood glucose levelbelow 95 mg/dL, with postprandial levels below 140 mg/dLand 2-hour postprandial levels below 120 mg/dL. In comparison, for pregnant women without diabetes, near-normal glucose values include a fasting value between 60 to 90 mg/dL, a 1-hour postprandial value of 100 to120 2-hour postprandial value of 60 to120 mg/dL. Such tight control has been advocated because it is associated with a reduction in macrosomia (Scollan-Koliopoulos, Guadagno, & Walker, 2006). Women with diabetes need comprehensive prenatal care. The primary goals of care are to maintain glycemiccontrol and minimize the risks of the disease on the fetus.Key aspects of treatment include nutritional management,insulin regimens, and close maternal and fetal surveillance.Nutritional management focuses on maintaining bal- anced glucose levels and providing enough energy andnutrients for the pregnant woman, while avoiding ketosis,and minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia in women treatedwith insulin (Edelstein & Herbold, 2007). Women whoreceive dietary instruction and follow it have been shownto have a better pregnancy outcome than those who don'treceive dietary advice (Henriksen, 2006). For the womanwith gestational diabetes, nutritional management maybe all that is necessary. Insulin, which doesn't cross the placenta, historically has been the medication of choice for treating hyper-glycemia in pregnancy. Recent studies have examinedthe use of oral hypoglycemic medications in pregnancy.Several studies have used glyburide (Diabeta) with prom-ising results. However, oral hypoglycemic agents are notusually recommended to control blood glucose levels inpregnant women by the ADA or ACOG because of insuf-cient research data. Many health care providers areusing glyburide and metformin as an alternative to insulintherapy. Much debate and controversy remains aboutoral hypoglycemic use during pregnancy because thelong-term effects of these medications on the mother andinfant are still unknown (Simpson & Creehan, 2008).When oral agents are prescribed, additional treatmentwith insulin may be necessary as the pregnancy advances (Scollan-Koliopoulos, Guadagno, & Walker, 2006).

The ADA recommends that women diagnosed with gestational diabetes by a 3-hour glucose tolerance test re- ceive nutritional counseling from a registered dietitian. TheADA also recommends insulin therapy if diet is unsuccess- ful in achieving a fasting glucose level below 105 mg/dL,a 1-hour postprandial level below 155 mg/dL, or 2-hourpostprandial level below 130 mg/dL (ADA, 2007b). The American College of Obstetricians and Gyne- cologists (ACOG) recommends the use of diet or insulinto achieve a 1-hour postprandial blood glucose level of 130 mg/dL. Both ADA and ACOG believe that further studies are needed to establish the safety of oral antidia-betic agents. Glycemic control\u2014regardless of whether itinvolves diet, insulin, or oral agents\u2014leads to fewer cases of shoulder dystocia, hyperbilirubinemia requiring pho- totherapy, nerve palsy, bone fracture, large for gestational age status, and fetal macrosomia (ADA, 2008).Insulin remains the medication of choice for glycemic control in pregnant and lactating women with any type of diabetes (Ekpebegh et al., 2007). Generally, insulin doses are reduced in the rst trimester to prevent hypoglycemia resulting from increased insulin sensitivity as well as fromnausea and vomiting. Newer short-acting insulins such aslispo (Humalog) and aspart (Novolog), glycemia, episodes of hypoglycemia between meals(Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Target fasting glu-cose values of 60 to 90 mg/dL and 1-hour postprandialvalues less than 120 mg/dL are necessary to provide goodglycemic control and good pregnancy outcomes (Frieden& Chan, 2007). Changes in diet and activity level add to the need for changes in insulin dosages throughout pregnancy. Insulin regimens vary, and controversy remains over the best strategy for insulin delivery in pregnancy. Manyhealth care providers use a split-dose therapy ( 23of the daily dose in the morning and the remaining 13in the evening). Others advocate the use of an insulin pump to Farrar, D., Tuffnell, D. J., & West, J. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injections of insulin for pregnant women with diabetes. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007. Issue 3. Art. No.: CD005542.DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005542.pub2.Study A woman who has diabetes and becomes pregnant is at risk for various problems, both for herself and her fetus.The goal during pregnancy is to maintain optimal glucose control. For these women, insulin is the mainstay of treatment. Unfortunately blood glucose levels are notstatic and insulin requirements change throughout pregnancy. Insulin typically is administered subcutaneously, com- monly in multiple doses throughout the day. However, italso may be administered via a continuous subcutaneousinfusion. The question arises as to which method of insulinadministration affords the best control of blood glucoselevels. The belief is that the continuous infusions would provide better blood glucose control and thus reduce therisks of problems for the mother and fetus. A study was conducted comparing the effects of continu- ous subcutaneous insulin infusions with multiple dailydoses of insulin therapy. The study involved a search ofrandomized controlled trials comparing these two meth-ods of administration and their effect on neonatal birth-weight, perinatal mortality, fetal anomalies, and maternalhypo- and hyperglycemia. Two studies consisting of 60 women were reviewed and a meta-analysis was performed.Findings Women receiving continuous insulin infusions experienced an increase in birthweight of their infants compared tomothers receiving multiple daily doses of insulin. However,the researchers did not identify this difference as clinicallysignicant. The researchers found no signicant differ-ences in perinatal mortality, fetal anomalies, or maternalhypo- and hyperglycemia between the two groups. The researchers attributed this to the small number of trials reviewed and the limited sample size of participants in thestudy. They concluded that there was insufcient evidenceto support one method being better than the other. The researchers recommended additional research using amore vigorous approach and larger samples of women. Nursing Implications This study, although inconclusive, does underscore the need for glucose control in women with pregestational dia-betes. Nurses need to be aware of these ndings so thatthey can integrate knowledge of adequate blood glucosecontrol when teaching pregnant women with diabetes aboutits potential effects, regardless of the method for insulin ad-ministration. Nurses also need to be cognizant of the various methods for insulin administration so that they can incorpo- rate the information from this study to provide individualizedcare to the pregnant woman with diabetes, thereby promot-ing the best possible outcomes for the mother and her fetus. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 20.1 Selecting Methods of Insulin Administration for Pregnant Women With Diabetes11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/14/08 12:11 PM Page 568woman demonstrate her technique for blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration if appropriate. Al-though the client may have had diabetes for some time,do not assume that she has a rm knowledge base abouther disease process or management of it (Fig. 20.1). Assess the woman's risk for gestational diabetes at the rst prenatal visit. The ADA (2007b) recommends as-sessing all women for risk factors and then determiningthe need for additional testing in the high-risk group only.Factors that place a woman at high risk include: Previous infant with congenital anomaly (skeletal, renal, central nervous system, cardiac) History of gestational diabetes or hydramnios in a previous pregnancy Family history of diabetes Age 35 or older Previous infant weighing more than 9 pounds (4,000 g) Previous unexplained fetal demise or neonatal death Maternal obesity (Body Mass Index [BMI] > 30) Hypertension Hispanic, Native American, or African-American ethnicity Recurrent monilia infections that don't respond to treatment Signs and symptoms of glucose intolerance (polyuria, polyphagia, polydipsia, fatigue) Presence of glycosuria or proteinuria (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007) Women with clinical characteristics consistent with a high risk for gestational diabetes should undergo glucosetesting as soon as feasible. Provide close ongoing assessment throughout the antepartal period. Women with gestational diabetes mel-litus are at increased risk for preeclampsia and glucose control-related complications such as hypoglycemia,hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis. Gestational diabetesof any severity increases the risk of fetal macrosomia. Itis also associated with an increased frequency of mater-nal hypertensive disorders and operative births. This maybe the result of fetal growth disorders (ADA, 2007b). FIGURE20.1 The nurse is demonstrating the technique for self- blood glucose monitoring with a pregnant client. deliver a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Re- gardless of which protocol is used, frequent blood glu-cose measurements are necessary, and the insulin dosageis adjusted on the basis of daily glucose levels. Close maternal and fetal surveillance is also essential. Frequent laboratory tests are done during pregnancy tomonitor the woman's status and glucose control. Fetal sur-veillance via diagnostic testing aids in evaluating fetal well-being and assisting in determining the best time for birth. For the laboring woman with diabetes, intravenous saline is given and blood glucose levels are monitoredevery 1 to 2 hours. Glucose levels are maintained below110 mg/dL throughout labor to reduce the likelihood ofneonatal hypoglycemia. If necessary, an infusion of reg-ular insulin may be given to maintain this level (ADA,2007b). If the woman was receiving insulin during herpregnancy, adjustments in dosage may be necessaryafter birth since glucose diversion across the placenta tosupply the growing fetus is no longer present and insulinresistance is now removed. Frequently, the woman withgestational diabetes can remain controlled through dietand weight management; the woman with type 1 dia-betes usually returns to prepregnant levels of insulin ad-ministration (Modder, 2008). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment begins at the rst prenatal visit. A thorough history and physical examination in conjunc-tion with specic laboratory and diagnostic testing aids indeveloping an individualized plan of care for the womanwith diabetes. Health History and Physical Examination For the woman with pregestational diabetes, obtain a thorough history of the preexisting diabetic condition. Askabout her duration of disease, management of glucose lev-els (insulin injections, insulin pump, or oral hypoglycemicagents), dietary adjustments, presence of vascular compli-cations and current vascular status, current insulin regi-men, and technique used for glucose testing. Review anyinformation that she may have received as part of herpreconception counseling and measures that were imple-mented during this time. Be knowledgeable about the woman's nutritional re- quirements and assess the adequacy and pattern of herdietary intake. Assess her blood glucose self-monitoringin terms of technique, frequency, and her ability to adjustthe insulin dose based on the changing patterns. Askabout the frequency of episodes of hypoglycemia or hyper-glycemia to ascertain the woman's ability to recognize andtreat them. Continue to assess her for signs and symptomsof hypo- and hyperglycemia. During antepartum visits, assess the client's knowl- edge about her disease, including the signs and symptomsof hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacido-sis, insulin administration techniques, and the impact of pregnancy on her chronic condition. If possible have theCHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 56911223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 569Even though gestational diabetes is diagnosed during pregnancy, the woman may have had glucose intolerancebefore the pregnancy. Therefore, monitor the womanclosely for signs and symptoms of possible complications. Also assess the woman's psychosocial adaptation to her condition. This assessment is critical to gain her co-operation for a change in regimen or the addition of a newregimen throughout pregnancy. Identify her support sys-tems and note any nancial constraints, as she will needmore intense monitoring and frequent fetal surveillance. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The results of laboratory and diagnostic tests providevaluable information about maternal and fetal well-being.Women with pregestational diabetes and those discoveredto have gestational diabetes require ongoing maternal andfetal surveillance to promote the best outcome. Screening ACOG and ADA currently recommend a risk analysis ofall pregnant women at their rst prenatal visit and addi-tional screening of all high-risk pregnant women again at24 to 28 weeks, or earlier if risk factors are present. If theinitial screening risk assessment is low, additional screen-ing may not be necessary. Pregnant women who fulll allof the following criteria need not be screened: No history of glucose intolerance Less than 25 years old Normal body weight No family history (rst-degree relative) of diabetes No history of poor obstetric outcome Not from an ethnic/racial group with a high prevalence of diabetes (ADA, 2007b) If the initial risk assessment is high, rescreening should take place between 24 and 28 weeks. A woman with abnormalearly results may have had diabetes before the pregnancy,and her fetus is a great risk for congenital anomalies. An el-evated glycosylated hemoglobin supports the likelihood ofgestational diabetes (D'Arrigo, 2007). There is little consensus regarding the appropriate screening method. Typically, screening is based on a 50-g1-hour glucose challenge test, usually performed betweenweek 24 and 28 of gestation (ADA, 2007b). A 50-g oralglucose load is given, without regard to the timing orcontent of the last meal. Blood glucose is measured 1 hourlater; a level above 140 mg/dL is abnormal. If the resultis abnormal, a 3-hour glucose tolerance test is done. Nor-mal values are: Fasting blood glucose level: less than 105 mg/dL At 1 hour: less than 190 mg/dL At 2 hours: less than 165 mg/dL At 3 hours: less than 145 mg/dL A diagnosis of gestational diabetes can be made only after an abnormal result is obtained on the glucose toler-ance test. Two or more abnormal values conrm a diag- nosis of gestational diabetes (ADA, 2007a). Surveillance Maternal surveillance may include the following: Urine check for protein (may indicate the need for further evaluation for preeclampsia) and for nitratesand leukocyte esterase (may indicate a urinary tractinfection) Urine check for ketones (may indicate the need for evaluation of eating habits) Kidney function evaluation every trimester for creatinine clearance and protein levels Eye examination in the rst trimester to evaluate the retina for vascular changes HbA1c every 4 to 6 weeks to monitor glucose trends (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007) Fetal surveillance may include ultrasound to provide information about fetal growth, activity, and amniotic fluidvolume and to validate gestational age. Alpha-fetoproteinlevels may be obtained to detect congenital anomalies suchas an open neural tube or ventral wall defects of omphalo-cele or gastroschisis, and a fetal echocardiogram may benecessary to rule out cardiac anomalies. A biophysicalprole helps to monitor fetal well-being and uteroplacen-tal profusion, and nonstress tests commonly are performedweekly after 28 weeks' gestation to evaluate fetal well-being. As the pregnancy progresses, an amniocentesismay be done to determine the lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio and the presence of phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) toevaluate whether the fetal lung is mature enough for birth(Frieden & Chan, 2007). Nursing Management The ideal outcome of every pregnancy is a healthy new-born and mother. Nurses can be pivotal in realizing thispositive outcome for women with pregestational or ges-tational diabetes by implementing measures to minimizerisks and complications. Since the woman with diabetesis considered to be at high risk, antepartal visits occur morefrequently (every 2 weeks up to 28 weeks and then twicea week until birth), providing the nurse with numerousopportunities for ongoing assessment, education, andcounseling (Nursing Care Plan 20.1). Promoting Optimal Glucose Control At each visit, review the mother's blood glucose levels, in-cluding any laboratory tests and self-monitoring results.Reinforce with the woman the need to perform blood glu-cose monitoring (usually four times a day, before meals and at bedtime) and to keep a record of the results. If ap-propriate, obtain a ngerstick blood glucose level to eval-uate the accuracy of self-monitoring results. Also assessthe woman's techniques for monitoring blood glucoselevels and for administering insulin if ordered, and offersupport and guidance. If the woman is receiving insulin570 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 570Nursing Care Plan 20.1 OVERVIEW OF THE PREGNANT WOMAN WITHTYPE1 DIABETES Donna, a 30-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, presents to the maternity clinic for preconception care. She has been a diabetic for 8 years and takes insulin twice daily by injection. She does blood glucose self-monitoring four times daily. Shereports that her disease is fairly well controlled, but \"I'm worried about how my diabetes will affect a pregnancy and mybaby. Will I need to make changes in my routine? Will my baby be normal?\" She reports that she recently had a foot infection and needed to go to the emergency room because it led to an episode of ketoacidosis. She states that her lastglycosylated hemoglobin A1c test results were abnormal. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Decient knowledge related to type 1 diabetes, blood glucose control, and effects of condition on pregnancy as evidenced by questions about effect on pregnancy, possible changes in regimen, and pregnancy outcome Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will demonstrate increased knowledge of type 1 diabetes and effects on pregnancy as evidenced by proper tech- niques for blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration, ability to modify insulin doses and dietary intake to achievecontrol, and verbalization of need for glycemic control prior to pregnancy, with blood glucose levels remaining within normal range. Interventions: Providing Client Teaching Assess client's knowledge of diabetes and pregnancy to establish a baseline from which to develop an individualized teaching plan. Review the underlying problems associated with diabetes and how pregnancy affects glucose control to provide client with a rm knowledge base for decision making. Review signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and prevention and management measures to ensure client can deal with them should they occur. Provide written materials describing diabetes and care needed for control to provide opportunity for client's review and promote retention of learning. Observe client administering insulin and self-glucose testing for technique and offer suggestions for improvement ifneeded to ensure adequate self-care ability. Discuss proper foot care to prevent future infections. Teach home treatment for symptomatic hypoglycemia to minimize risk to client and fetus. Outline acute and chronic diabetic complications to reinforce the importance of glucose control. Discuss use of contraceptives until blood glucose levels can be optimized before conception occurs to promote best possible health status before conception. Explain the rationale for good glucose control and the importance of achieving excellent glycemic control before pregnancy to promote a positive pregnancy outcome. Review self-care practices (blood glucose monitoring and frequency of testing; insulin administration; adjustment of insulin dosages based on blood glucose levels) to foster independence in self-care and feelings of control over the situation. Refer client for dietary counseling to ensure optimal diet for glycemic control. Outline obstetric management and fetal surveillance needed for pregnancy to provide client with information on what to expect. Discuss strategies for maintaining optimal glycemic control during pregnancy to minimize risks to client and fetus.CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 57111223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 571572 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK therapy, assist with any changes needed if glucose levels are not controlled. Obtain a urine specimen and check for glucose, pro- tein, and ketones. Ask the woman if she has had any epi-sodes of hypoglycemia and what she did to alleviate them. Discuss dietary measures related to blood glucose control (Fig. 20.2). In addition, recommend the following: Avoid weight loss and dieting during pregnancy. Ensure that food intake is adequate to prevent ketone formation and promote weight gain. Eat three meals a day plus three snacks to promote glycemic control.-40% of calories from good-quality complex carbo- hydrates -35% of calories from protein sources-25% of calories from unsaturated fats (ADA, 2007b)NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to future pregnancy and its outcome secondary to underlying diabetes as evidenced by questions about her condition's effect on the baby and baby being normal Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will openly express her feelings related to her diabetes and pregnancy as evidenced by statements of feeling better about her pre-existing condition and pregnancy outlook, and statements of understanding related to future childbearing bylinking good glucose control with positive outcomes for both herself and offspring. Interventions: Minimizing Anxiety Review the need for a physical examination to evaluate for any effects of diabetes on the client's health status. Explain the rationale for assessing client's blood pressure, vision, and peripheral pulses at each visit to provide information related to possible effects of diabetes on health status. Identify any alterations in present diabetic condition that need intervention to aid in minimizing risks that may increase client's anxiety level. Review potential effects of diabetes on pregnancy to promote client understanding of risks and ways to control or minimize them. Encourage active participation in decision making and planning pregnancy to promote feelings of control over the situation and foster self-condence. Discuss feelings about future childbearing and managing pregnancy to help reduce anxiety related to uncertainties. Encourage client to ask questions or voice concerns to help decrease anxiety related to the unknown. Emphasize the use of frequent and continued surveillance of client and fetal status during pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications and aid in alleviating anxieties related to the unknown. Provide positive reinforcement for healthy behaviors and actions to foster continued use and enhancement of self-esteem.Nursing Care Plan 20.1 (continued) FIGURE20.2 The pregnant client eating a nutritious meal to ensure adequate glu-cose control. Nutrient requirements and recommenda- tions for weight gain for the pregnant woman with diabetes are the same as those for thepregnant nondiabetic woman.Take NOTE! utes per week. Exercise may lessen the need for insulin ordosage adjustments. When caring for the laboring woman with pregesta- tional or gestational diabetes, adjust the intravenous flowrate and the rate of supplemental regular insulin based on If necessary, arrange for consultation with a dietitian or nutritionist to individualize the dietary plan. Also encour-age the women to participate in an exercise program thatincludes at least three sessions lasting longer than 15 min-11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 572the blood glucose levels as ordered. Monitor blood glu- cose levels every 1 to 2 hours or more frequently if neces-sary. Keep a syringe with 50% dextrose solution available at the bedside to treat profound hypoglycemia. Monitorfetal heart rate patterns throughout labor to detect non-reassuring patterns. Assess maternal vital signs everyhour, in addition to assessing the woman's urinary out-put with an indwelling catheter. If a cesarean birth isscheduled, monitor the woman's blood glucose levelshourly and administer short-acting insulin or glucosebased on the blood glucose levels as ordered. After birth, monitor blood glucose levels every 2 to 4 hours and continue intravenous fluid administration asordered. Encourage breastfeeding to assist in maintain-ing good glucose control. For the woman with pregesta-tional diabetes and type 1 or 2 diabetes, expect insulinneeds to decrease rapidly after birth: they may be reducedby half of the antepartum dose as meals are started(Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Some women mayreturn to their prepregnancy insulin dosage. The therapy plan after childbirth is individualized for each woman. If recommended dietary modications arecarried out along with weight loss, the woman with ges-tational diabetes may return to her normal glucose levels.This is also true for the woman with pregestational dia-betes, except that she will return to her prepregnancy in-sulin administration levels. This provides the nurse witha wonderful opportunity to reinforce healthy lifestyleinterventions on the postpartum unit. Nurses can alsobecome involved with community-based education tocontinue to offer their expertise. Preventing Complications Assess the woman closely for signs and symptoms ofcomplications at each visit. Anticipate possible complica-tions and plan appropriate interventions or referrals.Check the woman's blood pressure for changes and eval-uate for proteinuria when obtaining a urine specimen.These might suggest the development of preeclampsia.Measure fundal height and review gestational age. Noteany discrepancies between fundal height and gestationalage or a sudden increase in uterine growth. These maysuggest hydramnios. Encourage the woman to perform daily fetal move- ment counts to monitor fetal well-being. Tell her specif-ically when she should notify her health care provider.Also prepare the woman for the need for frequent labo-ratory and diagnostic testing to evaluate fetal status. As-sist with serial ultrasounds to monitor fetal growth andwith nonstress tests and biophysical proles to assess fetalwell-being. Providing Client Education and Counseling The pregnant woman with diabetes requires counselingand education about the need for strict glucose monitor-ing, diet and exercise, and signs and symptoms of compli-cations. Encourage the client and her family to make anylifestyle changes needed to optimize the pregnancy out- come. Providing dietary education and lifestyle advice thatextends beyond pregnancy may lower the risk that thewoman will have gestational diabetes in subsequent preg-nancies as well as type 2 diabetes (Scollan-Koliopoulos,Guadagno, & Walker, 2006). At each visit stress the im-portance of performing blood glucose screening and doc-umenting the results. With proper instruction, the clientand her family will be able to cope with all the changes inher body during pregnancy (Teaching Guidelines 20.1). Review discussions about the timing of birth and the rationale. Counsel the client about the possibility ofcesarean birth for an LGA infant, or inform the woman who will be giving birth vaginally about the possible needfor augmentation with oxytocin (Pitocin). In the woman with well-controlled dia- betes, birth is typically not induced before term unless there are complications, such as preeclamp-sia or fetal compromise. An early delivery date mightbe set for the woman with poorly controlled diabeteswho is having complications.Take NOTE! Instruct the client about the benets of breastfeeding related to blood glucose control. Breastfeeding helps tonormalize blood glucose levels. Therefore, encourage thewoman to breastfeed her newborn. Also teach the womanreceiving insulin for her diabetes that her insulin needsafter birth will drastically decrease. Inform her that shewill need a repeat glucose challenge test at a postpartumvisit (ADA, 2007b). For the woman with gestational diabetes, the focus is on lifestyle education. Women with gestational diabeteshave a greater than 50% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (ADA, 2007a). Inform the woman thatscreening most likely will be done at the postpartumfollow-up appointment in 6 weeks. Women with normalresults at that visit typically are screened every 3 yearsthereafter (ADA, 2007a). Teach her how to maintain anoptimal weight to reduce her risk of developing diabetes.If necessary, refer the woman to a dietitian to help out-line a balanced nutritious diet. Cardiovascular Disorders Every minute, an American woman dies of cardiovascu-lar disease (American Heart Association [AHA], 2007).Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death formen and women in the United States. It kills nearly500,000 women each year. Despite the prominent reduc-tion in cardiovascular mortality among men, the rate hasnot declined for women. Cardiovascular disease haskilled more women then men since 1984 (AHA, 2007).In addition to being the number-one killer of women, atCHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 57311223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 573the time of diagnosis women have both a poorer overall prognosis and a higher risk of death than men diagnosedwith heart disease (Peddicord, 2005). More women dieof heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseasesthan men, yet many women do not realize they are at risk.These diseases kill more women each year than the nextve causes of death combined (AHA, 2007). Approximately 3% of pregnant women have cardiac disease, which is responsible for 10% to 25% of maternaldeaths (Cunningham et al., 2005). The prevalence of car-diac disease is increasing as a result of lifestyle patterns, including cigarette smoking, diabetes, and stress. As women are delaying childbearing, the incidence of cardiacdisease in pregnancy will continue to increase. Rheumaticheart disease used to represent the majority of cardiacconditions during pregnancy, but congenital heart diseasenow constitutes nearly half of all cases of heart disease en-countered during pregnancy. Classic symptoms of heartdisease mimic common symptoms of late pregnancy, suchas palpitations, shortness of breath with exertion, andoccasional chest pain. Few women with heart disease dieduring pregnancy, but they are at risk for other complica-tions, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. Theiroffspring are also at risk of complications, such as prema-ture birth, low birthweight for gestational age, respiratorydistress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and death(Abdin, 2006). CONGENITAL AND ACQUIRED HEART DISEASE Congenital heart disease often involves structural defects that are present at birth but may not be discovered at thattime (Table 20.2). Until recently women with congenitalheart disease didn't live long enough to bear children.Today, due to new surgical techniques to correct thesedefects, many of these women can complete a successfulpregnancy at relatively low risk when appropriate coun-seling and optimal care are provided. Increasing numbersof women with complex congenital heart disease arereaching childbearing age. Complications such as growthrestriction and preterm and premature birth and fetal andneonatal mortality are more common among children ofwomen with congenital heart disease. The risk of compli-cations is determined by the severity of the cardiac lesion,the presence of cyanosis, the maternal functional class,and the use of anticoagulation (Karamermer & Roos-Hesselink, 2007). Women with certain congenital conditions should avoid pregnancy. These include uncorrected tetralogy ofFallot or transposition of the great arteries, and Eisen-menger's syndrome, a defect with both cyanosis and pul-monary hypertension (Karamermer & Roos-Hesselink,2007).TEACHING GUIDELINES 20.1 Teaching for the Pregnant Woman With Diabetes Be sure to keep your appointments for frequent prenatal visits and tests for fetal well-being. Perform blood glucose self-monitoring as directed, usually before each meal and at bedtime. Keep arecord of your results and call your healthcareprovider with any levels outside the establishedrange. Bring your results to each prenatal visit. Perform daily \"fetal kick counts.\" Document themand report any decrease in activity. Drink 8 to 10 8-ounce glasses of water each day to prevent bladder infections and maintainhydration. Wear proper, well-tted footwear when walking toprevent injury. Engage in a regular exercise program such aswalking to aid in glucose control, but avoidexercising in temperature extremes. Consider breastfeeding your infant to lower yourblood glucose levels. If you are taking insulin: Administer the correct dose of insulin at thecorrect time every day. Eat breakfast within 30 minutes after injectingregular insulin to prevent a reaction. Plan meals at a xed time and snacks to preventextremes in glucose levels. Avoid simple sugars (cake, candy, cookies), whichraise blood glucose levels. Know the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemiaand treatment needed: Sweating, tremors, cold, clammy skin, headache Feeling hungry, blurred vision, disorientation, irritability Treatment: Drink 8 ounces of milk and eat twocrackers or glucose tablets Carry \"glucose boosters\" (such as Life Savers) toprevent hypoglycemia.

Complicationsinclude arrhythmias, heart failure,and pulmonary hypertension (McMahon, 2007). Abnormal persistence of an open lumen in the ductus arteriosus between theaorta and the pulmonary artery afterbirth; results in increased pulmonaryblood flow and redistribution of flowto other organs (Hermes-DeSantis &Clyman, 2006) Very common in the general population, occurring most often in youngerwomen Leaflets of the mitral valve prolapse into the left atrium during ventricular contraction. The most common cause of mitral valve regurgitation if present during preg-nancy (Wooley & Boudoulas, 2007) Usually improvement in mitral valve func- tion due to increased blood volumeand decreased systemic vascular re-sistance of pregnancy; most womenare able to tolerate pregnancy well. Most common chronic rheumatic valvular lesion in pregnancy Causes obstruction of blood flow from the atria to the ventricle, thereby decreasing ventricular lling andcausing a xed cardiac output Resultant pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricularfailure (Barker et al., 2006) Most pregnant women with this condi- tion can be managed medically.Hospitalization and bed rest possible after the 20th week with hemodynamic moni-toring via a pulmonary artery catheter tomonitor volume status Oxygen therapy may be necessary during labor and birth. Treatment with atrioventricular nodal blocking agents, and at times with electrical cardioversion (Gilbert & Harmon, 2006) Rest with limited activity if symptomatic Surgical ligation of the open ductus during infancy; subsequent problems minimalafter surgical correction Most women are asymptomatic; diagnosis is made incidentally. Occasional palpations, chest pain, or arrhythmias in some women, possiblyrequiring beta-blockers Usually no special precautions are neces- sary during pregnancy. General symptomatic improvement with medical management involving diuret-ics, beta-blockers, and anticoagulanttherapy Activity restriction, reduction in sodium, and potentially bed rest if condition severeTABLE 20.2 SELECTED HEARTCONDITIONS AFFECTING PREGNANCYCHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 575 (continued)11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 575576 stenosis Peripartum cardiomyopathy Myocardial infarctionCondition Description Management Narrowing of the opening of the aortic valve, leading to an obstruction toleft ventricular ejection (Balentine &Eisenhart, 2008). Women with mild disease can tolerate hypervolemia of pregnancy; withprogressive narrowing of the open-ing, cardiac output becomes fixed.Diagnosis can be confirmed withechocardiography. Most womencan be managed with medical ther-apy, bed rest, and close monitoring. Rare congestive cardiomyopathy that may arise during pregnancy.Multiparity, age, multiple fetuses,hypertension, an infectious agent,autoimmune disease, or cocaineuse may contribute to its presence(Mooney, 2007). Development of heart failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of giving birth without anypreexisting heart disease or anyidentiable cause Rare during pregnancy but incidence is expected to increase as olderwomen are becoming pregnant and the risk factors for coronary artery disease become more prevalent Factors contributing to MI include family history, stress, smoking, age,obesity, multiple fetuses, hypercho-lesterolemia, and cocaine use (Gibson & Carson, 2007). Increased plasma volume and cardiac output during pregnancy increasethe cardiac workload as well as themyocardial oxygen demands; imbal-ance in supply reduce risk of heart failure and/ordysrhythmias Bed rest/limited activity and close monitoring Preload reduction with diuretic therapy Afterload reduction with vasodilatorsImprovement in contractility with inotropic agents Nonpharmacologic approaches include salt restriction and daily exercise suchas walking or biking. The question of whether another preg nancy should be attempted is controversialdue to the high risk of repeat complications. Usual treatment modalities for any acute MI along with consideration for thefetus Anticoagulant therapy, rest, and lifestyle changes to preserve the health of bothparties Sources: Balentine & 2007; O'Toole, 2005. Acquired heart disease is typically rheumatic in origin (see Table 20.2). The incidence of rheumatic heart dis-ease has declined dramatically in the past several decadesbecause of prompt identication of streptococcal throatinfections and treatment with antibiotics. When the heartis involved, lesions such as mitral stenosis, pro-lapse, or aortic stenosis are common. Many women are postponing childbearing until the fourth or fth decade of life. With advancing maternalage, underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia contributing to is-chemic heart disease become more common and increasethe incidence of acquired heart disease complicating preg- nancy. Coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctionmay result. A woman's ability to function during the pregnancy is often more important than the actual diagnosis of the car-diac condition. The following is a functional classicationTABLE 20.2 SELECTED HEARTCONDITIONS AFFECTING PREGNANCY (continued)11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 576system developed by the Criteria Committee of the New York Heart Association (1994) based on past and presentdisability and physical signs: Class I: asymptomatic with no limitation of physical activity Class II: symptomatic (dyspnea, chest pain) with increased activity Class III: symptomatic (fatigue, palpitations) with normal activity Class IV: symptomatic at rest or with any physical activity The classication may change as the pregnancy pro- gresses and the woman's body must cope with the in-creasing stress on the cardiovascular system resultingfrom the numerous physiologic changes taking place.Typically, a woman with class I or II cardiac disease cango through a pregnancy without major complications. Awoman with class III disease usually has to maintain bedrest during pregnancy. A woman with class IV diseaseshould avoid pregnancy (McCann, 2007). Women withcardiac disease may benet from preconception counsel-ing so that they know the risks before deciding to becomepregnant. Maternal mortality varies directly with the functional class at pregnancy onset. ACOG has adopted a three-tiered classication according to the risk of death duringpregnancy (Box 20.1).Pathophysiology Numerous hemodynamic changes occur in all pregnant women. These normal physiologic changes can over-stress the woman's cardiovascular system, increasing herrisk for problems. Increased cardiac workload and greatermyocardial oxygen demand during pregnancy place thewoman's cardiovascular system at high risk for morbidityand mortality. BOX 20.1 Classication of Maternal Mortality Risk Group I (minimal risk) has a mortality rate of 1% and comprises women with: Patent Mitral stenosis, class I and II Group II (moderate risk) has a mortality rate of 5% to 15% and comprises coarctation without valvular involvement Articial valve replacement Group III (major risk) has a 25% to 50% mortality rate and comprises women with: Pulmonary hypertension Complicated aortic coarctation Previous myocardial infarction Take NOTE! Uterine blood flow increases by at least 1 liter per minute, requiring the body to produce more blood during pregnancy. This results in a25% increase in red blood cells, a 50% expansion ofplasma volume during pregnancy, and an overall hemo- dilution. In addition, the increase in total red bloodcellular volume includes an increase in clotting factorsand platelets, dening the hypercoagulable state ofpregnancy (Dobbenga-Rhodes & Prive, 2006). Thesechanges start as early as the second month of gestation. Similarly, cardiac output increases steadily during pregnancy by 30% to 50% over prepregnancy levels: strokevolume increases 20% to 30% from prepregnant levels, andthe maternal heart rate increases by 10 to 20 beats perminute. The increase is due to both the expansion in bloodvolume and the augmentation of stroke volume and heartrate. Other hemodynamic changes associated with preg-nancy include a decrease in both the systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, thereby low-ering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In addition,the hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy might in-crease the risk of arterial thrombosis and embolization.These normal physiologic changes are important for asuccessful adaptation to pregnancy but create uniquephysio logic challenges for the woman with cardiac disease (Comparison Chart 20.1). Therapeutic Management Ideally, a woman with a history of congenital or acquiredheart disease should consult her health care provider beforebecoming pregnant and should undergo a risk assessment.This risk assessment must consider the woman's functionalcapacity, exercise tolerance, degree of cyanosis, medicationneeds, and history of arrhythmias. Data needed for risk as-sessment can be acquired from a thorough cardiovascularhistory and examination, a 12-lead electrocardiogram(ECG), and evaluation of oxygen saturation levels by pulseoximetry. The impact of heart disease on a woman's child-bearing potential needs to be clearly explained, and infor-mation on how pregnancy may affect her and the fetus isimportant. This allows women to make an informed choice Sources: Gilbert & Harmon, 2006; Gilbert, 2007; Blackburn, 2007.CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 57711223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 577578 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK whether they wish to accept the risks associated with preg- nancy. When possible, any surgical procedures, such asvalve replacement, should be done before pregnancy to im-prove fetal and maternal outcomes (Uebing et al., 2006). If the woman presents for care after she has become pregnant, prenatal counseling focuses on the impact of thehemodynamic changes of pregnancy, the signs and symp-toms of cardiac compromise, and dietary and lifestylechanges needed. More frequent prenatal visits (every 2 weeks until the last month and then weekly) are usuallyneeded to ensure the health and safety of the mother andfetus. Nursing Assessment Frequent and thorough assessments are crucial during theantepartum period to ensure early detection of and promptintervention for problems. Assess the woman's vital signs,noting any changes. Auscultate the apical heart rate andheart sounds, being especially alert for abnormalities, in-cluding irregularities in rhythm or murmurs. Check theclient's weight and compare to baseline and weights ob-tained on previous visits. Report any weight gain outsiderecommended parameters. Inspect the extremities foredema and note any pitting. Question the woman about fetal activity, and ask if she has noticed any changes. Report any changes such as a de-crease in fetal movements. Ask the woman about anysymptoms of preterm labor, such as low back pain, uterinecontractions, and increased pelvic pressure and vaginaldischarge, and report them immediately. Assess the fetalheart rate and review serial ultrasound results to monitorfetal growth. Assess the client's lifestyle and her ability to cope with the changes of pregnancy and its effect on her cardiac sta-tus and ability to function. Evaluate the client's under-standing of her condition and what restrictions and lifestylechanges may be needed to provide the best outcome for herand her fetus. A healthy infant and mother at the end ofpregnancy is the ultimate goal. As the client's pregnancyadvances, expect her functional class to be revised based onher level of disability. Suggest realistic modications.The nurse plays a major role in recognizing the signs and symptoms of cardiac decompensation. Decompensa-tion refers to the heart's inability to maintain adequate cir-culation. As a result, tissue perfusion in the mother and thefetus is impaired. The pregnant woman is most vulnerablefor this complication from 28 to 32 weeks of gestation andin the rst 48 hours postpartum (Witcher & Harvey, 2006).Assess the woman for the following signs and symptoms: Shortness of breath on exertion, dyspnea Cyanosis of lips and nail beds Swelling of face, hands, and feet Jugular vein engorgement Rapid respirations Abnormal heartbeats, reports of heart racing or palpitations Chest pain with effort or emotion Syncope with exertion Increasing fatigue Moist, frequent cough Measurement Prepregnancy Pregnancy Heart rate 72 (\u00b110 bpm) +10-20% Cardiac output 4.3 (\u00b10.9 L/min) +30% Blincoe, 2007; Blackburn, 2007; Harvey, 2007. Assessing the pregnant woman with heart disease for cardiac decompensation is vital because the mother's hemodynamic status determinesthe health of the fetus.Take NOTE! Nursing Management Nursing management of the pregnant woman with heart disease focuses on assisting with measures to stabilize themother's hemodynamic status, because a decrease in ma-ternal blood pressure or volume will cause blood to beshunted away from the uterus, thus reducing placental per-fusion. Pregnant women with cardiac disease also need as-sistance in reducing risks that would lead to complicationsor further cardiac compromise. Therefore, education andcounseling are critical. Collaboration between the cardiol-ogist, obstetrician, perinatologist, and nurse is needed topromote the best possible outcome.11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 578Encourage the woman to continue taking her cardiac medications as prescribed. Review the indications, ac-tions, and potential side effects of the medications. Re-inforce the importance of frequent antepartal visits andclose medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. Discuss the need to conserve energy. Help the client to prioritize household chores and childcare to allow restperiods. Encourage the client to rest in the side-lying position, which enhances placental perfusion. Encourage the client to eat nutritious foods and con- sume a high-ber diet to prevent straining and constipa-tion. Discuss limiting sodium intake if indicated to reducefluid retention. Contact a dietitian to assist the woman inplanning nutritionally appropriate meals. Assist the woman in preparing for diagnostic tests to evaluate fetal well-being. Describe the tests that may bedone, such as ECG and echocardiogram, and explain theneed for serial nonstress testing, usually beginning at ap-proximately 32 weeks. Instruct the woman in how to monitor fetal activity and movements. Urge her to do this daily and report anychanges in activity immediately. Although the morbidity and mortality rates of preg- nant women with cardiac disease have decreased greatly,congestive arrhythmia, thrombo-embolism, angina, hypoxemia, and occur (Witcher & Harvey, 2006). Explain the signsand symptoms of these complications and review the signand symptoms of cardiac decompensation, encouragingthe woman to notify her health care provider if any occur. Provide support and encouragement throughout the antepartal period. Assess the support systems available tothe client and her family, and encourage her to use them.If necessary, assist with referrals to community servicesfor additional support. During labor, anticipate the need for invasive hemo- dynamic monitoring, and make sure the woman has beenprepared for this beforehand. Monitor her fluid volumecarefully to prevent overload. Anticipate the use of epiduralanesthesia if a vaginal birth is planned. After birth, assessthe client for fluid overload as peripheral fluids mobilize.This fluid shift from the periphery to the central circulationtaxes the heart, and signs of heart failure such as cough,progressive dyspnea, edema, palpitations, and postpartum diuresis be-gins. Because hemodynamics do not return to baseline forseveral days after childbirth, women at intermediate or highrisk require monitoring for at least 48 hours postpartum(Barker et al., 2006). CHRONIC HYPERTENSION Chronic hypertension exists when the woman has high blood pressure before pregnancy or before the 20th weekof gestation, or when hypertension persists for more than12 weeks postpartum. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua-tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC, 2003)has classied blood pressure as follows: Normal: diastolic Prehypertension: systolic 120 diastolic 80 Mild hypertension: systolic 140 mmHg, diastolic 90 to 99 mmHg Severe hypertension: systolic 160 mm Hg or higher, diastolic 100 mm Hg or higher Chronic hypertension occurs in up to 22% of women of childbearing age, with the prevalence varying accord-ing to age, race, and BMI. It complicates at least 5% ofpregnancies, with 1 in 4 women developing preeclampsiaduring pregnancy (Blincoe, 2007). Chronic hypertensionis typically seen in older, obese women with glucose intol-erance. The most common complication is preeclampsia,which is seen in approximately 25% of women who enterthe pregnancy with hypertension (Podymow & August,2007; Tihtonen et al., 2007). (See Chapter 19 for moreinformation about preeclampsia.) Therapeutic Management Preconception counseling is important in fostering posi-tive outcomes. Typically, it involves lifestyle changessuch as diet, exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation. Treatment for women with chronic hypertension fo- cuses on maintaining normal blood pressure, preventingsuperimposed preeclampsia/eclampsia, and ensuringnormal fetal development. Once the woman is pregnant,antihypertensive agents are typically reserved for severehypertension (150 to 160 mmHg/100 to 110 mmHg).Methyldopa (Aldomet) is commonly prescribed becauseof its safety record during pregnancy. This slow-actingantihypertensive agent helps to improve uterine perfu-sion. Other antihypertensive atenolol (Tenorium), andnifedipine (Procardia) (Gibson & Carson, 2007). Lifestyle changes are needed and should continue throughout gestation. The woman with chronic hyperten-sion will be seen more frequently (every 2 weeks until 28 weeks and then weekly until birth) to monitor her bloodpressure and to assess for any signs of preeclampsia. At ap-proximately 24 weeks' gestation, the woman will be in-structed to document fetal movement. At this same time,serial ultrasounds will be ordered to monitor fetal growthand amniotic fluid volume. Additional tests will be in-cluded if the client's status changes. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the woman with chronic hyperten- sion involves a thorough history and physical examina tion. Review the woman's history closely for risk factors. TheCHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 57911223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 579pathogenesis of hypertension is multifactorial and in- cludes many modiable risk factors such as smoking, obe-sity, caffeine intake, excessive alcohol intake, excessive saltintake, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Also be alert for nonmodiable risk factors such as in-creasing age and African-American race (Sharp, 2006).Ask if the woman has received any preconceptual counsel-ing and what measures have been used to prevent or con-trol hypertension. Assess the woman's vital signs, in particular her blood pressure. Evaluate her blood pressure in all three positions(sitting, lying, and standing) and note any major differencesin the readings. Assess her for orthostatic hypertension when she changes her position from sitting to standing. Docu-ment your ndings. Ask the woman if she monitors her blood pressure at home; if so, inquire about the typical readings. Ask thewoman if she uses any medications for blood pressure con-trol, including the drug, dosage, and frequency of admin-istration, as well as any side effects. Ask the woman aboutlifestyle modications that she has used to address anymodiable risk factors, and their effectiveness. Hypertension during pregnancy decreases uteropla- cental perfusion. Therefore, fetal well-being must be as-sessed and closely monitored. Anticipate serial ultrasoundsto assess fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume. Questionthe woman about fetal movement and evaluate her reportof daily \"kick counts.\" Assess fetal heart rate at every visit. Nursing Management Preconception counseling is the ideal time to discuss life- style changes to prevent or control hypertension. One areato cover during this visit would be the Dietary Approachesto Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which contains an ad-equate intake of potassium, magnesium, and calcium.Sodium is usually limited to 2.4 g. Suggest aerobic exercise,although the woman should cease it once the pregnancy isconrmed. Encourage smoking cessation and avoidance ofalcohol. If the woman is overweight, encourage her to loseweight before becoming pregnant, not during the preg-nancy (Dudek, 2006). Stressing the positive benets of ahealthy lifestyle might help motivate the woman to makethe modications and change unhealthy habits. Assist the woman in scheduling appointments for an- tepartum visits every 2 weeks until 28 weeks' gestationand then weekly. Prepare the woman for frequent fetalassessments. Explaining the rationale for the need tomonitor fetal growth is important to gain the woman'scooperation. Carefully monitor the woman for signs andsymptoms of abruptio placentae (abdominal pain, rigidabdomen, vaginal bleeding), as well as superimposed pre-eclampsia (elevation in blood pressure, weight gain,edema, proteinuria). Alerting the woman to these risks al-lows early identication and prompt intervention. Stress the importance of daily periods of rest (1 hour) in the left lateral recumbent position to maximize placen-tal perfusion. Encourage women with chronic hyperten- sion to use home blood pressure monitoring devices.Urge the woman to report any elevations. As necessary,instruct the woman and her family how to take andrecord a daily blood pressure, and reinforce the need forher to take her medications as prescribed to control herblood pressure and to ensure the well-being of her un-born child. Praising her for her efforts at each prenatalvisit may motivate her to continue the regimen through-out her pregnancy. The close monitoring of the woman with chronic hypertension continues during labor and birth and dur-ing the postpartum period to prevent or identify the onsetof preeclampsia. Accurate and frequent blood pressurereadings and careful administration of antihypertensivemedications, if prescribed, are essential components ofcare. Stressing the need for continued medical supervi-sion after childbirth is vital to motivate the woman tomaintain or initiate lifestyle changes and dietary habitsand stay compliant with her medication regimen. Respiratory Conditions During pregnancy, the respiratory system is affected by hor-monal changes, mechanical changes, and prior respiratoryconditions. These changes can cause a woman with a his-tory of compromised respiration to decompensate duringpregnancy. While upper respiratory infections are typicallyself-limiting, chronic respiratory conditions, such as asthmaor tuberculosis, can have a negative effect on the growingfetus when alterations in oxygenation occur in the mother.The outcome of pregnancy in a woman with a respiratorycondition depends on the severity of the oxygen alterationas well as the degree and duration of hypoxia on the fetus. ASTHMA Asthma affects approximately 1% to 4% of pregnancies. It affects 20 million Americans and is one of the mostcommon and potentially serious medical conditions tocomplicate pregnancy (Arenson & Drake, 2007). Mater-nal asthma is associated with an increased risk of infantdeath, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation(IUGR), preterm birth, and low birthweight. These risksare linked to the severity of asthma: more severe asthmaincreases the risk (National Asthma Education Preven-tion Program [NAEPP], 2007). Remember Rose, the pregnant teenager with asthma in acute distress described at the beginning of the chapter?What therapies might be offered to control her symptoms?Should she be treated differently than someone who is notpregnant? Why or why not?580 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 580Pathophysiology Asthma, an allergic-type inflammatory response of the respiratory tract to various stimuli, is also known as reac-tive airway disease because the bronchioles constrict inresponse to allergens, irritants, and infections. bronchoconstriction, inflammation of the airwaysproduces thick mucus that further limits the movementof air and makes breathing difcult. The normal physiologic changes of pregnancy affect the respiratory system. While the respiratory rate doesnot change, hyperventilation increases at term by 48%due to high progesterone levels. Diaphragmatic elevationand a decrease in functional lung residual capacity occurlate in pregnancy, which may reduce the woman's abil-ity to inspire deeply to take in more oxygen. Oxygen con-sumption and the metabolic rate both increase, placingadditional stress on the woman's respiratory system(American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunol-ogy [AAAAI], 2007). Both the woman and her fetus are at risk if asthma is not well managed during pregnancy. When a preg-nant woman has trouble breathing, her fetus also hastrouble getting the oxygen it needs for adequate growthand development. Severe persistent asthma has beenlinked to the development of maternal hypertension,preeclampsia, placenta previa, uterine hemorrhage, andoligohydramnios. Women whose asthma is poorly con-trolled during pregnancy are at increased risk of pretermbirth, low birthweight, and stillbirth (Hackley, Kriebs,& Rousseau, 2007). The severity of the condition improves in one third of pregnant women, remains unchanged in one third, andworsens in one third (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007).However, the effect of pregnancy on asthma is unpre-dictable. The greatest increase in asthma attacks usually oc-curs between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation; flare-ups are rareduring the last 4 weeks of pregnancy and during labor(AAAAI, 2007). Therapeutic Management Asthma should be treated as aggressively in pregnant women as in nonpregnant women because the benets of avertingan asthma attack outweigh the risks of medications. Thegoals of treatment are to prevent hospitalization, emergency room visits, work loss, and chronic disability. NAEPP rec- ommends three specic drugs recommended for the treat- ment of asthma during pregnancy, but they can be usedto treat severe asthma attacks during pregnancy (AAAAI,2007).Nursing Assessment Obtain a thorough history of the disease, including the woman's usual therapy and control measures. Questionthe woman about asthma triggers and strategies used toreduce exposure to them (Box 20.2). Review the client'smedication therapy regimen. Auscultate the lungs and assess respiratory and heart rates. Include the rate, rhythm, and depth of respirations;skin color; blood pressure and pulse rate; and signs of fatigue. Patients with an acute asthma attack often presentwith wheezing, chest tightness, tachypnea, nonproductivecoughing, shortness of breath, and Lung auscul-tation ndings might include diffuse wheezes and rhonchi,bronchovesicular sounds, and a more prominent expira-tory phase of respiration compared to the inspiratory phase(More, 2007). If the pregnancy is far enough along, thefetal heart rate is measured and routine prenatal assess-ments (weight, blood pressure, fundal height, urine forprotein) are completed. Laboratory studies usually include a complete blood count with differential (to assess the degree of nonspecicinflammation and identify anemia) and pulmonary func-tion tests (to assess the severity of an attack and to providea baseline to evaluate the client's response to treatment). Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on client education aboutthe condition and the skills necessary to manage it: self-monitoring, correct use of inhalers, identifying and limit-ing exposure to asthma triggers, and following a long-termplan for managing asthma and for promptly handlingsigns and symptoms of worsening asthma. Client educa-tion fosters adherence to the treatment regimen, therebypromoting an optimal environment for fetal growth anddevelopment. Ensure that the woman understands drug actions and interactions, the uses and potential abuses of asthma BOX 20.2 Common Asthma Triggers Smoke and chemical irritants Air pollution Dust mites Animal dander Seasonal changes with pollen, molds, and spores Upper respiratory infections Esophageal reflux Medications, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Exercise Cold air Emotional AAAAI, 2007; Little & Sinert, 2008; Gilbert, 2007.CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 58111223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 581582 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK medications, and the signs and symptoms that require medical evaluation. Reviewing potential perinatal com-plications with the woman is helpful in motivating her toadhere to the prescribed regimen. At each antepartumvisit, reassess the efcacy of the treatment plan to deter-mine whether adjustments are needed. Taking control of asthma in pregnancy is the respon- sibility of the client along with her health care team. Pro-viding the client with the knowledge and tools to monitorher condition, control triggers and her environment(Teaching Guidelines 20.2), and use medications to pre-vent acute exacerbations assist the client in taking control.Facilitating a partnership with the woman will improveperinatal outcomes. When teaching the pregnant woman with asthma, cover the following topics: Signs and symptoms of asthma progression and exacerbation Importance and safety of medication to the fetus and to herself Warning signs that indicate the need to contact the health care provider Potential harm to the fetus and to herself by under- treatment or delay in seeking help Prevention and avoidance of known triggers Home use of metered-dose inhalers Adverse effects of medications During labor, monitor the client's oxygenation satu- ration by pulse oximetry and provide pain managementthrough epidural analgesia to reduce stress, which may trigger an acute attack. Continuously monitor the fetusfor distress during labor and assess fetal heart rate pat-terns for hypoxia. Assess the newborn for signs and symp-toms of hypoxia. TEACHING GUIDELINES 20.2 Teaching to Control Environmental Triggers Remove any carpeting in the house, especially the bedroom, to reduce dust mites. Use allergen-proof encasing on the mattress, boxspring, and pillows. Wash all bedding in hot water. Remove dust collectors in house, such as stuffedanimals, books, knick-knacks. Avoid pets in the house to reduce exposure to petdander. Use a high-efciency particulate air-ltering systemin the bedroom. Do not smoke, and avoid places where you can beexposed to passive cigarette smoke from others. Stay indoors and use air conditioning when thepollen or mold count is high or air quality is poor. Wear a covering over your nose and mouth whengoing outside in the cold weather. Avoid exposure to persons with colds, flu, or viruses. Successful asthma management can reduce adverse perinatal outcomes: preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birthweight.Take NOTE! Rose, the pregnant teenager described earlier, is concerned about passing her asthma on to her baby. What should thenurse discuss with her? What questions should the nurse askto help in identifying triggers in Rose's environment toprevent future asthma attacks? TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that has been around for years but never seems to go away completely. Globally, TBis second only to HIV/AIDS as a cause of illness and deathin adults, accounting for over 9 million cases of active dis-ease and 2 million deaths each year. Someone in the worldis newly infected with TB every second. Overall, one thirdof the world's population is currently infected with TB(World Health Organization [WHO], 2007). Although itis not prevalent in the United States, a resurgence wasnoted starting in the mid-1980s secondary to the AIDSepidemic and immigration. Left undiagnosed and un-treated, each person with active TB will infect on averagebetween 10 and 15 people each year (WHO, 2007). Withthe large numbers of immigrants coming to the UnitedStates, all nurses must be skilled in screening for and man-aging this condition. A person becomes infected by inhaling the infectious organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is carried on a droplet nuclei and spread by airborne transmission. Thelung is the major site of involvement, but the lymph glands,meninges, bones, joints, and kidneys can become infected.Women can remain asymptomatic for long periods of timeas the organism may lie dormant. Pregnant women withuntreated TB are more likely to have preeclampsia, miscar-riage, preterm labor, an underweight infant, an infant witha low Apgar score, and perinatal death (Bothamley, 2006).The newborn is at risk of postnatally acquired TB if themother still has active TB at the time of birth. Therefore,prenatal diagnosis and effective treatment of the mother areessential. 11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 582Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of TB during pregnancy is essentially the same as that for the general population.Medications are the cornerstone of treatment to preventinfection from progressing. The medical therapy for preg-nant women is a combination of medications such as iso-niazid, rifampin, and ethambutol, taken daily for up to 9 months. These anti-TB agents appear to have minimalteratogenic risks and may be started as soon as the diagno-sis of TB is made. However, extensive research has notbeen done to determine the denitive safety of these drugs(Herchline & Amorosa, 2007). Nursing Assessment Review the woman's history for risk factors such as im-munocompromised status, recent immigration status,homelessness or overcrowded living conditions, and in-jectable drug use. Women emigrating from developingcountries such as Latin America, Asia, the Indian sub-continent, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, Mexico, Haiti,and Africa with high rates of TB also are at risk. At antepartum visits, be alert for clinical manifesta- tions of TB, including fatigue, fever or night sweats, non-productive cough, slow weight loss, anemia, hemoptysis,and anorexia (Noyes & Popay, 2007). If TB is suspectedor the woman is at risk for developing TB, anticipatescreening with puried protein derivative (PPD) adminis-tered by intradermal injection. If the client has been exposed to TB, a reddened induration will appear within 72 hours. If the test is positive, anticipate a follow-up chestx-ray with lead shielding over the abdomen and sputumcultures to conrm the diagnosis. Nursing Management Compliance with the multidrug therapy is critical toprotect the woman and her fetus from progression of TB.Provide education about the disease process, the mode oftransmission, prevention, potential complications, and theimportance of adhering to the treatment regimen. Stressing the importance of health-promotion activi- ties throughout the pregnancy is important. Some sugges-tions might include avoiding crowded living conditions,avoiding sick people, maintaining adequate hydration,eating a nutritious, well-balanced diet, keeping all pre-natal appointments to evaluate fetal growth and well- being, and getting plenty of fresh air by going outside frequently.Determining the woman's understanding of her conditionand treatment plan is important for compliance. A lan-guage interpreter may be needed to validate and reinforceher understanding if she does not speak English. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated during the med- ication regimen and should in fact be encouraged. Man-agement of the newborn of a mother with TB involvespreventing transmission by teaching the parents not tocough, sneeze, or talk directly into the newborn's face. Nurses need to stay current about new therapies andscreening techniques to treat this centuries-old disease. Hematologic Conditions Anemia , a reduction in red blood cell volume, is mea- sured by hematocrit (Hct) or a decrease in the concentra-tion of hemoglobin (Hgb) in the peripheral blood. Thisresults in reduced capacity of the blood to carry oxygen tothe vital organs of the mother and fetus. Anemia is a signof an underlying problem but does not indicate its origin. IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron deciency anemia affects one in four pregnancies and is usually related to an inadequate dietary intake of iron(McCann, 2007). It is a very common state in pregnantwomen. Anemia during the early part of pregnancy can in-crease the likelihood of preterm birth, low birthweight, andperinatal mortality (Blackburn, 2007). With signicantmaternal iron depletion, the fetus will attempt to storeiron, but at the cost to the mother. Anemia at term in-creases the perinatal risk for both the mother and newborn.The risks of hemorrhage (impaired platelet function) andinfection during and after birth also are increased. Therapeutic Management The goals of treatment for iron deciency anemia in preg-nancy are to eliminate symptoms, correct the deciency,and replenish iron stores. The CDC recommends routineiron supplementation for all pregnant women at a low doseof 30 mg/day beginning at the rst prenatal visit. Attempt-ing to meet maternal iron requirements solely through dietin the face of diminished iron stores is difcult. Nursing Assessment Review the mother's history for factors that may contributeto the development of iron deciency anemia, includingpoor nutrition, hemolysis, pica (consuming non-food sub- stances), multiple gestation, limited intervals between preg-nancies, and blood loss. Assess the woman's dietary intakeas well as the quantity and timing of ingestion of sub-stances that interfere with iron absorption, such as tea, cof-fee, chocolate, and high-ber foods. Ask the woman if shehas fatigue, weakness, malaise, anorexia, or increased sus-ceptibility to infection, such as frequent colds. Inspect theskin and mucous membranes, noting any pallor. Obtainvital signs and report any tachycardia. Prepare the woman for laboratory testing. Labora- tory tests usually reveal low Hgb 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 58311223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 583584 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with iron deciency anemia focuses on encouraging compliance with drugtherapy and providing dietary instruction about the in-take of foods high in iron. Although iron constitutes aminimal percentage of the body's total weight, it has sev-eral major roles: it assists in the transport of oxygen andcarbon dioxide throughout the body, it aids in the pro-duction of red blood cells, and it plays a role in the body'simmune response. Stress the importance of taking the prenatal vitamin and iron supplement consistently. Encourage the womanto take the iron supplement with vitamin C-containingfluids such as orange juice, which will promote absorp-tion, rather than milk, which can inhibit iron absorption.Taking iron on an empty stomach improves its absorp-tion, but many women cannot tolerate the gastrointesti-nal discomfort it causes. In such cases, advise the womanto take it with meals. Instruct the woman about adverseeffects, which are predominantly gastrointestinal and in-clude gastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, di-arrhea, metallic taste, and constipation. Suggest that thewoman take the iron supplement with meals and increaseher intake of ber and fluids to help overcome the mostcommon side effects. Provide dietary counseling. Recommend foods high in iron, such as dried fruits, whole grains, green leafy veg-etables, meats, peanut butter, and iron-fortied cereals(Dudek, 2006). Anticipate the need for a referral to a di-etitian. Teaching Guidelines 20.3 highlights instructionsfor the pregnant woman with iron deciency anemia. THALASSEMIA Thalassemia is a group of hereditary anemias in which synthesis of one or both chains of the hemoglobin mole-cule (alpha and beta) is defective. A low Hgb and a mi-crocytic, hypochromic anemia result. The prevalence andseverity of thalassemia depend on the woman's racialbackground: persons of Mediterranean, Asian, Italian, or Greek heritage and African-Americans are most fre-quently affected. Beta-thalassemia is the most commonform found in the United States (Curran & Poggi, 2007). Thalassemia occurs in two forms: alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia. Alpha-thalassemia (minor), theheterozygous form, results from the inheritance of one ab-normal gene from either parent, placing the offspring in acarrier trait state. These women have little or no hemato-logic disease and are clinically asymptomatic (silent carrierstate). Beta-thalassemia (major) is the form involving inher-itance of the gene from both parents. Beta-thalassemiamajor can be very severe. Genetic counseling might be nec-essary when decisions about childbearing are being made. Thalassemia minor has little effect on the pregnancy, although the woman will have mild, persistent anemia.This anemia does not respond to iron therapy, and ironsupplements should not be prescribed. Women withthalassemia major do not usually become pregnant be-cause of lifelong severe hemolysis, anemia, and prema-ture death (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Management of thalassemia during pregnancy de- pends on the severity of the disease. Identication andscreening are important to plan care. The woman's eth-nic background, medical history, and blood studies areanalyzed. If the woman is determined to be a carrier,screening of the father of the child is indicated. Knowl-edge of the carrier state of each parent provides the ge-netic counselor with knowledge about the risk that thefetus will be a carrier or will have the disease (Curran &Poggi, 2007). Take NOTE! Hemoglobin and hematocrit decrease normally during pregnancy in response to an increase in blood plasma in comparison to red bloodcells. This hemodilution can lead to physiologic anemiaof pregnancy, which is expected in the second trimesterof pregnancy. This hemodilution phenomenon shouldnot be confused with an iron deciency anemia, inwhich the Hgb would be below 11 g/100 mL and Hctbelow 35%.TEACHING GUIDELINES 20.3 Teaching for the Woman With Iron Deciency Anemia Take your prenatal vitamin daily; if you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. For best absorption, take iron supplement betweenmeals. Avoid taking iron supplement with coffee, tea,chocolate, and high-ber food. Eat foods rich in iron, such as: Meats, green leafy vegetables, legumes, driedfruits, whole grains Peanut butter, bean dip, whole-wheat fortiedbreads and cereals For best iron absorption from foods, consume thefood along with a food high in vitamin C. Increase your exercise, fluids, and high-ber foods to reduce constipation. Plan frequent rest periods during the day. 11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 584Mild anemia may be present, and instructions to rest and avoid infections are helpful. Nurses should providesupportive care and expectant management throughoutthe pregnancy. SICKLE CELL ANEMIA Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive inherited con- dition that results from a defective hemoglobin molecule(hemoglobin S). It is found most commonly in African-Americans, Southeast Asians, and Middle Eastern popu-lations. About 1 in 10 African-Americans are carriers ofthe trait, while approximately 3 in 800 are affected withthe disease (McCann, 2007). People with only one genefor the trait (heterozygous) will have sickle cell trait with-out obvious symptoms of the disease and with little effecton the pregnancy. Pathophysiology In the human body, the hemoglobin molecule serves as theoxygen-carrying component of the red blood cells. Mostpeople have several types of circulating hemoglobin (HbAand HbA2) that make up the majority of their circulatorysystem. In sickle cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin S(HbS) replaces HbA and HbA2. This abnormal hemoglo-bin (HbS) becomes sickle-shaped as a result of any stressor trauma such as infection, fever, acidosis, dehydration,physical exertion, excessive cold exposure, or hypoxia. Sig-nicant anemia results. (See Chapter 46 for more informa-tion about sickle cell disease.) Sickle cell anemia during pregnancy is associated with more severe anemia and frequent vaso-occlusive crises,with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity and mor-tality. In pregnant women with sickle cell anemia, compli-cations can occur at any time during gestation, labor andbirth, or postpartum. This is believed to be secondary tohormonal modications, hypercoagulable state, and in-creased susceptibility to infection. growth restriction, and low birthweight (El-sayegh & Shapiro, 2007). Therapeutic Management Ideally, women with hemoglobinopathies are screened be-fore conception and are made aware of the risks of sicklecell anemia to themselves and to the fetus. A blood hemo-globin electrophoresis is done for all women from high-riskancestry at their rst prenatal visit to determine the typesand percentages of hemoglobin present. This informationshould help them in making reproductive decisions. Treatment depends on the health status of the woman. During pregnancy, only supportive therapy is used: bloodtransfusions for severe anemia, analgesics for pain, and antibiotics for infection. Nursing Assessment Assess the woman for signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia. Ask the woman if she has anorexia, dyspnea, ormalaise. Inspect the color of the skin and mucous mem-branes, noting any pallor. Be alert for indicators of sicklecell crisis, including severe abdominal pain, muscle spasms,leg pains, joint pain, fever, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting,and seizures (McCann, 2007). Nursing Management Clients require emotional support, education, and follow-up care to deal with this chronic condition, which can havea great impact on the woman and her family. Monitor vitalsigns, fetal heart rate, weight gain, and fetal growth. Assesshydration status at each visit and urge the client to drink 8to 10 glasses of fluid daily to prevent dehydration. Teachthe client about the need to avoid infections (includingmeticulous handwashing), cigarette smoking, alcohol con-sumption, and temperature extremes. Assist the woman in scheduling frequent fetal well- being assessments, such as biophysical proles, nonstresstests, and contraction stress tests, and monitor laboratorytest results for changes. Throughout the antepartal period,be alert for early signs and symptoms of crisis. During labor, encourage rest and provide pain management. Oxygen supplementation is typically usedthroughout labor, along with intravenous fluids to main-tain hydration. The fetal heart rate is monitored closely.After giving birth, the woman is tted with antiembolismstockings to prevent blood clot formation. Before dis-charge from the facility after birth of the newborn, discussfamily planning options. Infections A wide variety of infections can affect the progression ofpregnancy, possibly having a negative impact on the out-come. The effect of the infection depends on the timingand severity of the infection and the body systems in-volved. Common viral infections include cytomegalovirus(CMV), rubella, herpes simplex, 20.3). Toxoplasmosis and group B streptococcusare common nonviral infections. Only the most commoninfections will be discussed here. CYTOMEGALOVIRUS Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital and perinatal viral infection in the world, possibly affecting up to 3% of all newborns (Ross, Jones, & Lynch,CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 58511223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 585586 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK 2006). Pregnant women acquire active disease primarily from sexual contact, blood transfusions, kissing, and con-tact with children in daycare centers. The virus can befound in virtually all body fluids. Prevalence rates in womenin the United States range from 50% to 85% (Hoerst &Samson, 2007). The incidence of primary CMV infectionin pregnant women in the United States ranges from 1% to3% (Hoerst & Samson, 2007). CMV infection during preg- may result in abortion, stillbirth, birthweight,IUGR, blindness, or neonatal infection. The rstor primary infection, if it occurs during pregnancy, is themost dangerous to the fetus: the fetus has a Implications Maternal infection increases risk of prema- ture labor and birth. Newborn may be born with congenital syphilis\u2014jaundice, rhinitis, anemia,IUGR, and CNS involvement. Majority of women are asymptomatic. It causes ophthalmia neonatorum in the newborn from birth through infected birth canal. Majority of women are asymptomatic. Infection is associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous preterm labor, premature ruptureof membranes, low birthweight, stillbirth,and neonatal mortality. Infection is transmitted to newborn through vaginal birth. Neonate may develop conjunctivitis or pneumonia. Infection causes warts in the anogenital area, known as condylomata acuminata. These warts may grow large enough to block a vaginal birth. Fetal exposure to HPV during birth is asso- ciated with laryngeal papillomas. Infection produces itching and burning, dysuria, strawberry patches on cervix,and vaginal discharge. Infection is associated with premature rupture of membranes and preterm birth.All pregnant women should be screened for this STI and treated with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM to preventplacental transmission. All pregnant women should be screened at rst prenatal visit, with repeat screeningin the third trimester. All newborns receive mandatory eye prophy- laxis with tetracycline or erythromycinwithin the rst hour of life. Mother is treated with ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 125 mg IM in single dose before goinghome. All pregnant women should be screened at rst prenatal visit and treated with erythromycin. Warts are treated with trichlorocetic acid, liquid nitrogen, or laser therapy under colposcopy. A quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) against the viral types most likely tocause cervical cancer (types 16 and 18)and genital warts (types 6 and 11) hasbeen licensed in the United States forgirls and women 9 to 26 years old. Thevaccine is 95% to 100% effective (Zimmerman, 2007). It is hoped that thisvaccine will reduce the number of HPV-positive pregnant women in the future. Treatment is with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole (Flagyl).TABLE 20.3 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AFFECTING PREGNANCY Sources: Guidelines, 2006; Moore & 3:03 PM Page 586Most women are asymptomatic and don't know they have been exposed to CMV. Symptoms of CMV in thefetus and newborn, and mental retardation (Hoerst & Samson,2007). Since there is no therapy that prevents or treatsCMV infections, nurses are responsible for educating andsupporting childbearing-age women at risk for CMV in-fection. Stressing the importance of good handwashingand use of sound hygiene practices can help to reducetransmission of the virus. RUBELLA Rubella, commonly called German measles, is spread by droplets or through direct contact with a contaminated ob-ject. The risk of a pregnant woman transmitting this virusthrough the placenta to her fetus increases with earlier ex-posure to the virus. When infection occurs within the rstmonth after conception, 50% of fetuses show signs of in-fection; in the second month following conception, 25%of fetuses will be infected; and in the third month, 10% offetuses will be affected (Santis et al., 2006). Education for primary prevention is key. Ideally, all women have been vaccinated and have adequate immunityagainst rubella. However, all women are still screened attheir rst prenatal visit to determine their status. A rubellaantibody titer 1:8 or greater proves evidence of immunity.Women who are not immune should be vaccinated duringthe immediate postpartum period so they will be immunebefore becoming pregnant again (CDC, 2007c). Nursesneed to check the rubella immune status of all new moth-ers and should make sure all mothers with a titer of lessthan 1:8 are immunized prior to discharge after birth of thenewborn. HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS Approximately 50 million people are infected with geni- tal herpes in the United States, and 500,000 new casesare diagnosed annually. Despite strategies designed toprevent perinatal transmission, the of cases ofnewborn herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection continuesto rise, mirroring the rising prevalence of genital herpesinfection in women of childbearing age (Fischer, 2007). HSV is a DNA virus with two subtypes: HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 infections were traditionally associatedwith oral lesions (fever blisters), whereas HSV-2 infectionsoccurred in the genital region. Currently, either type canbe found in either location (Fischer, 2007). Infection occurs by direct contact of the skin or mu- cous membranes with an active lesion through such activ-ities as kissing, sexual (vaginal, oral, anal) contact, or routine skin-to-skin contact. HSV is associated with infec-tions of the genital tract that when acquired during preg-nancy can result in severe systemic symptoms in themother and signicant morbidity and mortality in the new-born (Baker, 2007). Once the virus enters the body, itnever leaves. Infants born to mothers with a primary HSV infec- tion have a 30% to 50% risk of acquiring the infection viaperinatal transmission near or during birth. Recurrentgenital herpes simplex infections carry a 1% to 3% risk ofneonatal infection if the recurrence occurs around thetime of vaginal birth (Xu et al., 2007). The greatest risk of transmission is when the mother develops a primary infection near term and it is not rec-ognized. Most neonatal infections are acquired at oraround the time of birth through either ascending infec-tion after ruptured membranes or contact with the virusat the time of birth. The method and timing of birth in awoman with genital herpes are controversial. The CDCrecommends that in the absence of active lesions, a vagi-nal birth is acceptable, but if the woman has active her-petic lesions near or at term, a cesarean birth should beplanned (CDC, 2008). All invasive procedures that mightcause a break in the infant's skin should be avoided, such as articial rupture of membranes, fetal scalp electrode,or forceps and vacuum extraction (Gilbert, 2007). Management for the woman with genital herpes dur- ing pregnancy involves caring for her as well as reducingthe risk of newborn herpes. Since the majority of newbornherpes cases result from perinatal transmission of the virusduring vaginal birth, and because transmission can resultin severe neurologic impairment or death, treatment ofthe mother with an antiviral agent such as acyclovir mustbe started as soon as the culture comes back positive. Uni-versal screening for herpes is not economically sound, sonurses need to remain knowledgeable about current prac-tice to provide accurate and sensitive care to all women. HEPATITIS B VIRUS Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world. HBV can be transmittedthrough contaminated blood, illicit drug use, and sexualcontact. The virus is 100 times more infectious than HIVand, unlike HIV, it can live outside the body in driedblood for more than a week (Hoerst & Samson, 2007). Sexual transmission accounts for most adult HBV in- fections in the United States. Acutely infected women de-velop hepatitis with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever,abdominal pain, and jaundice. In women with acute hep-atitis B, vertical transmission occurs in approximately 10%of newborns when infection occurs in the rst trimesterand in 80% to 90% of newborns when acute infection oc-CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 58711223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 587curs in the third trimester. Without intervention, 70% to 90% of infants born to women who are positive for hepa-titis B will have chronic hepatitis B by 6 months of age(Kripke, 2007). In addition, hepatitis B infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, lowbirthweight, and neonatal death. Newborns infected withHBV are likely to become chronic carriers of the virus, be-coming reservoirs for continued infection in the popula-tion (CDC, 2007e). The fetus is at particular risk duringbirth because of the possible contact with contaminatedblood at this time. Nursing Assessment Review the woman's history for factors placing her athigh risk: History of sexually transmitted infections Household contacts with HBV-infected persons Employment as a health care worker Abuse of intravenous drugs Sex worker (prostitute) Foreign born Multiple sexual partners Chinese, Southeast Asian, or African heritage Sexual partners who are HBV infected (CDC, 2007e) At the rst prenatal visit, all pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) viablood studies. Expect to repeat this screening later in preg-nancy for women in high-risk groups (Hoerst & Samson,2007). Nursing Management If a woman tests positive for HBV, expect to administerHBV immune globulin (HBIG, Hep-B-Gammagee).The newborn receives HBV vaccine (Recombivax-HB,Engerix-B) within 12 hours of birth. The second and thirddoses of the vaccine are given at 1 month and 6 months ofage (CDC, 2007e). The CDC recommends routine vac-cination of all newborns. Women who are HbsAg-negative may be vaccinated safely during pregnancy. No current research supportsthe use of surgical births to reduce vertical transmissionof HBV. Breastfeeding by mothers with chronic HBV in-fection does not increase the risk of viral transmission totheir newborns (Pyrsopoulos & Reddy, 2007). Client education related to prevention of HBV is es- sential. Teach the woman about safer sex practices, goodhandwashing techniques, and the use of standard precau-tions (Teaching Guidelines 20.4). Protection can be afforded with the highly effective hepatitis B vaccine. Permanent remission of the disease even with treat- ment rarely occurs. Therefore, therapy is directed atlong-term suppression of viral replication and preventionof end-stage liver disease. Urge the woman to consume ahigh-protein diet and avoid fatigue. A healthy lifestyle can help delay disease progression. Initiate an open discus-sion about the modes of transmission and use of con-doms to prevent spread. VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS Varicella zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is the virus that causes both varicella (chickenpox)and herpes zoster (shingles). Pregnant women are at riskfor developing varicella when they come in close contactwith children who have active infection. Maternal varicellacan be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta, lead-ing to congenital varicella syndrome, if the mother is in-fected during the rst half of pregnancy, via an ascendinginfection during birth, or by direct contact with infectiouslesions, leading to infection after birth. Varicella occurs inapproximately 1 to 7 of 10,000 pregnancies (Anderson &Safdar, 2007). Congenital varicella syndrome can occur in newborns of mothers infected during early pregnancy. It is character-ized by low birthweight, skin lesions in a scarring, (Laartz& Gompf, 2007). Preconception counseling is important for prevent- ing this condition. A major component of counseling in-volves determining the woman's varicella immunity. Thevaccine is administered if needed. Provide education towomen who work in occupations that increase the risk ofTEACHING GUIDELINES 20.4 Teaching to Prevent Hepatitis B Virus Abstain from alcohol. Avoid intravenous drug exposure or sharing of needles. Encourage all household contacts and sexualpartners to be vaccinated. Receive immediate treatment for any sexuallytransmitted infection. Know that your newborn will receive the hepatitisB vaccine soon after birth. Use good handwashing techniques at all times. Avoid contact with blood or body fluids. Use barrier methods such as condoms duringsexual intercourse. Avoid sharing any personal items, such as razors,toothbrushes, or eating utensils. 588 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 588exposure to the virus, such as daycare workers, teachers of young children, and staff caring for children in institu-tional settings. Varicella during pregnancy can be associated with se- vere illnesses for both the mother and her newborn. Ifcontracted in the rst half of pregnancy, some pregnantwomen are at risk for developing varicella pneumonia,which may put them at risk of life-threatening ventilatorycompromise and death (Sauerbrei & Wutzler, 2007). Ifthe rashes close generalized neonatal varicella leading to death inabout 20% of cases can be expected (Gardella & Brown,2007). is preventable by preconcep-tion The inci- dence of acute B19 infection in pregnancy is about 3%(Malee, 2007). Parvovirus B19 is a common, self-limitingbenign childhood virus that causes erythema infectiosum,also known as fth disease (referring to its \"fth place\" ina list of common childhood infections). Approximately50% to 65% of women of reproductive age have devel-oped to parvovirus B19 (Broliden, Tolfven-stam, & Norbeck, The infection is spread transplacentally, by the oropharyn-geal route in casual contact, and through infected blood.Infection of the fetus occurs through transplacental pas-sage of the virus. Acute infection in pregnancy can causeB19 infection in the fetus, leading to nonimmune fetal hy-drops secondary to severe anemia or fetal loss, dependingon the gestational age at the time of infection. The risk tothe fetus is greatest when the woman is exposed and in-fected within the rst 20 weeks of gestation. In addition tohydrops, other fetal effects of parvovirus include sponta-neous abortion, congenital anomalies (central nervous sys-tem, craniofacial, and eye), and long-term effects such ashepatic insufciency, myocarditis, and learning disabilities(Cunningham & Rennels, 2006). Therapeutic Management Generally, diagnosis of parvovirus is based on clinicalsymptoms and serologic antibody G and M(IgM). Parvovirus B19 infection is is shown by positive serum B19 IgG.Pregnant women who have been exposed to or who de-velop symptoms of parvovirus B19 require assessment todetermine whether they are susceptible to infection (non-immune). If the woman is immune, she can be reassuredthat she will not develop infection and that the virus will not adversely affect her pregnancy. If she is nonimmune,then referral to a perinatologist is recommended andcounseling regarding the risks of fetal transmission, fetalloss, and hydrops is necessary. Knowledge of how best tomanage it during pregnancy lags behind our understand-ing of the potential adverse consequences. Intrauterine B19 infection is a cause of fetal anemia, hydrops, and demise, and perhaps also of congenital anom-alies. The best strategy for surveillance of the infected preg-nant woman is serial ultrasounds for detection of hydropicchanges and fetal anemia, and treatment for severe fetalanemia. Serial ultrasounds are advocated because the ratesof fetal death and complications peak 4 to 6 weeks after ex-posure, but they can occur as late as 3 months followingonset of symptoms (Elbaz et al., 2007). The infected newborn is assessed for any anomaly and followed for up to 6 years to identify any sequelae(Cunningham & Rennels, 2006). Nursing Assessment Review the mother's history for any risk factors. School-teachers, daycare workers, and women living with school-aged children are at highest risk for being seropositive forparvovirus B19, especially if a recent outbreak has oc-curred in those settings. Also assess the woman for spe-cic signs and symptoms. The characteristic rash startson the face with a \"slapped-cheeks\" appearance and isfollowed by a generalized maculopapular rash. Fever,arthralgia, and generalized malaise are usually present inthe mother. Prepare the mother for antibody testing. Nursing Management Prevention is the best strategy. Stress the need for hand-washing after handling children; cleaning toys and surfacesthat children have been in contact with; and avoiding thesharing of food and drinks. Screening for parvovirus B19during early pregnancy may help in early diagnosis, but thecost-effectiveness of a national screening program has notbeen accepted to date. The nurse can provide informationregarding risk factors and potential complications if ex-posed and support the parent's decision. GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a naturally occurring bacterium found in 10% to 35% of healthy adults.Women who test positive for the GBS bacteria are con-sidered carriers. Carrier status is transient and doesn't in-dicate illness. Approximately 25% of pregnant womencarry GBS in the rectum or vagina, thus introducing therisk of colonization of the fetus during birth. GBS affectsabout 1 in every 2,000 newborns in the United StatesCHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 58911223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 589(March of Dimes, 2007d). Approximately 1 out of every 100 to 200 newborns born to mothers who carry GBSwill develop signs and symptoms of GBS disease. Al-though GBS is rarely serious in adults, it can be life-threatening to newborns. GBS is the most common causeof sepsis and meningitis in newborns and is a frequentcause of newborn pneumonia (Moos, 2006). Newbornswith early-onset (within a week after birth) GBS infec-tions may have pneumonia or sepsis, whereas late-onset(after the rst week) infections often manifest with menin-gitis (CDC, 2007b). Genital tract colonization poses the most threat to the newborn because of exposure during birth and to themother because of ascending infection after the mem-branes rupture. GBS colonization in the mother is thoughtto cause chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and postpartumwound infection. Therapeutic Management Antibiotic therapy usually is effective in treating womenwith GBS infections of the urinary tract or uterus, orchorioamnionitis without any sequelae. According to the2002 CDC guidelines, all pregnant women should bescreened for GBS at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. Vaginaland rectal specimens are cultured for the presence of thebacterium. If positive, the woman should be treated withintravenous antibiotics during labor. Penicillin G is the treatment of choice for GBS infec- tion because of its narrow spectrum. Alternative anti-biotics can be prescribed for clients with a penicillinallergy. The drug is usually administered intravenously atleast 4 hours before birth so that it can reach adequatelevels in the serum and amniotic fluid to reduce the riskof newborn colonization. Close monitoring is requiredduring the administration of intravenous antibiotics be-cause severe allergic reactions can occur rapidly. Nursing Assessment Review the woman's prenatal history, asking about any pre-vious infection. Determine if the woman's membranes haveruptured and the time of rupture. Rupture of amnioticmembranes greater than 18 hours increases the risk for in-fection. Monitor the mother's vital signs, reporting any ma-ternal fever greater than 100.4 \u00b0F. Assess the woman for other risk factors for perinatal transmission of GBS, includ-ing previous colonization with GBS, low socioeconomicstatus, African-American race, age less than 20 years, pos-itive colonization at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation, GBS in urinesample, previous birth of GBS-positive newborn, pretermbirth, and use of invasive obstetric procedures (March ofDimes, 2007d). Document this information to help pre-vent vertical transmission to the newborn. Many women with GBS infection are asymptomatic, but they may have urinary tract infections, uterine infec-tions, and chorioamnionitis.Nursing Management Nurses play major roles as educators and advocates for allwomen and newborns to reduce the incidence of GBS in-fections. Ensure that pregnant women between 35 and37 weeks' gestation are screened for GBS infection dur-ing a prenatal visit. Record the results and notify the birthattendant if the woman has tested positive for GBS. Dur-ing labor, be prepared to administer intravenous anti-biotics to all women who are GBS positive. TOXOPLASMOSIS Toxoplasmosis is a relatively widespread parasitic infec- tion caused by a one-celled organism, Toxoplasma gondii. When a pregnant woman is exposed to this protozoan,the infection can pose serious risks to her fetus. Between1 in 1,000 and 8,000 newborns are born infected withtoxoplasmosis in the United States (Hokelek & Safdar,2006). It is transferred by hand to mouth after touchingcat feces while changing the cat litter box or through gar-dening in contaminated soil. Consuming undercookedmeat, such as pork, lamb, or venison, can also transmit this organism. A pregnant woman who contracts toxoplasmosis for the rst time has approximately a 40% chance of passingthe infection to her fetus (March of Dimes, 2007e). Although the woman typically remains asymptomatic,transmission to her fetus can occur throughout preg-nancy. A fetus that contracts congenital toxoplasmosistypically has a low birthweight, enlarged liver and spleen,chorioretinitis, jaundice, neurologic damage, and anemia(Peyron et al., 2006). Treatment of the woman during pregnancy to reduce the risk of congenital infection is a combination of pyri-methamine and sulfadiazine. Treatment with sulfon-amides during pregnancy has been shown to reduce therisk of congenital infection. Prevention is the key to managing this infection. Nurses play a key role in educating the woman about measures toprevent toxoplasmosis (Teaching Guidelines 20.5). Vulnerable Populations Every year there are an estimated 220 million pregnan-cies worldwide, with about 6 million of them in the United States (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2007). Each preg-nancy runs the risk of an adverse outcome for the motherand the baby, but risks are dramatically increased for cer-tain vulnerable populations: adolescents, women over theage of 35, women who are HIV positive, and women whoabuse substances. While risks cannot be totally elimi-nated once pregnancy has begun, they can be reducedthrough appropriate and timely interventions.590 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 590Every woman's experience with pregnancy is unique and personal. The circumstances each one faces and whatpregnancy means to her involve emotions and experiencesthat belong solely to her. Many women in these specialpopulation groups go through this experience in confusionand isolation, feeling desperately in need of help but notknowing where to go. Although all pregnant women expe-rience these emotions to a certain extent, but they areheightened in women who have numerous psychosocial is-sues. Pregnancy is a stressful time. Pregnant women facewide-ranging changes in their lives, relationships, and bod-ies as they move toward parenthood. These changes canbe challenging for a woman without any additional stressesbut are even more so in the face of age extremes, illness, orsubstance abuse. Skilled nursing interventions are essential to promote the best outcome for the client and her baby. Timely sup-port and appropriate interventions during the perinatalperiod can have long-standing implications for the motherand her newborn, ultimately with the goal of stability andintegration of the family as a unit. PREGNANT ADOLESCENT Adolescence lasts from the onset of puberty to the ces- sation of physical growth, roughly from 11 to 19 years ofage. Adolescents vacillate between being children andbeing adults. They need to adjust to the physiologic changes their bodies are undergoing and establish a sex-ual identity during this time. They search for personalidentity and desire freedom and independence of thoughtand action. However, they continue to have a strong de-pendence on their parents (O'Toole, 2005). Each year in the United States, approximately 1 mil- lion adolescents, or 10% of girls between the ages of 15 to19 years, become pregnant. These pregnancies, which ac-count for 11% of all births, are typically unintended andoccur outside of marriage (Alan Guttmacher Institute,2006). In addition, about half of all teen pregnancies occurwithin 6 months of rst having sexual intercourse. Of girlswho become pregnant, one in six will have a repeatpregnancy within 1 year. Most of these girls are unmar-ried, and many are not ready for the emotional, psycho-logical, and financial responsibilities of parenthood(March of Dimes, 2007a). Adolescent pregnancy is fur-ther complicated by the adolescent's lack of financial re-sources: the income of teen mothers is half that ofwomen who have given birth in their 20s (March ofDimes, 2007a). Although the incidence of teenage pregnancy has steadily declined since the early 1990s, it continues to behigher in the United States than in any other industrial-ized country (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2006). Eventhis reduced incidence represents what is considered anunacceptably high level of pregnancy in an age group thatis likely to suffer the social consequences of early preg-nancy most. Subsequently, adolescent pregnancy is con-sidered a major health problem and is addressed in Healthy People 2010. Impact of Pregnancy in Adolescence Adolescents are a unique group with special needs relatedto their stage of development. Adolescent pregnancy canbe an emotionally charged situation, laden with ethicaldilemmas and decisions. Topics such as abstinence, safersex, abortion, and the decision to have a child are sensi-tive issues.TEACHING GUIDELINES 20.5 Teaching to Prevent Toxoplasmosis Avoid eating raw or undercooked meat, especially lamb or pork. Cook all meat to an internaltemperature of 160 \u00b0F throughout. Clean cutting boards, work surfaces, and utensils with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat orunwashed fruits and vegetables. Peel or thoroughly wash all raw fruits andvegetables before eating them. Wash hands thoroughly with warm water and soapafter handling raw meat. Avoid feeding the cat raw or undercooked meats. Avoid emptying or cleaning the cat's litter box.Have someone else do it daily. Keep the cat indoors to prevent it from huntingand eating birds or rodents. Avoid uncooked eggs and unpasteurized milk. Wear gardening gloves when in contact with outdoor soil. Avoid contact with children's sandboxes, becausecats can use them as litter boxes.

Nurses need to examine their own beliefs aboutteen sexuality to identify personal assumptions. Puttingaside one's moral convictions may be difcult, but it isnecessary when working with pregnant adolescents. To beeffective, health care providers must be able to communi-cate with adolescents in a manner they can understandand respect them as individuals. Developmental Issues An adolescent must accomplish certain developmentaltasks to advance to the next stage of maturity. These de-velopmental tasks include: Seeking economic and social stability Developing a personal value system Building meaningful relationships with others (Fig. 20.3) Becoming comfortable with their changing bodies Working to become independent from their parents Learning to verbalize conceptually (Zarrett & Eccles, 2006) Adolescents have special needs when working to ac- complish their developmental tasks and making a smoothtransition to young adulthood. One of the biggest areas ofneed is sexual health. Adolescents commonly lack the in-formation, skills, and services necessary to make informedchoices related to their sexual and reproductive health.Developmentally, adolescents are trying to gure out whothey are and how they t into society. As adolescents ma-ture, their parents become less influential and peers be-come more influential. Peer pressure can lead adolescentsto participate in sexual activity, as can the typical adoles-cent's belief that \"it won't happen to me\" (Box 20.3). As a result, unplanned pregnancies occur. Work on the developmental tasks of adolescence, especially iden-tity, can be interrupted as the adolescent attempts to in-tegrate the tasks of pregnancy, bonding, and preparing tocare for another with the tasks of developing self-identity and independence. A pregnant adolescent must try tomeet her own needs along with those of her fetus. Theprocess of learning how to separate from the parents whilelearning how to bond and attach to a newborn brings con-flict and stress. A pregnancy can exacerbate an adoles-cent's feeling of loss of control (Secco et al., 2007). Health and Social Issues Adolescent pregnancy has a negative impact in terms ofboth health and social consequences. For example, sevenout of ten adolescents will drop out of school. More than75% will receive public assistance within 5 years of havingtheir rst child. In addition, children of adolescent mothersare at greater risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, childabuse, neglect, poverty, and death (As-Sanie, Gantt, &Rosenthal, 2004). The younger the adolescent is at the timeof the rst pregnancy, the more likely it is that she will haveanother pregnancy during her teens (Holub et al., 2007). The psychosocial risks associated with early childbear- ing often have an even greater impact on mothers, families,and society than the obstetric or medical risks (Zeck et al.,2007). Pregnant adolescents experience higher rates of do-mestic violence and substance abuse. Those experiencingabuse are more likely to abuse substances, receive inade-quate prenatal care, and have lower pregnancy weightcompared with those who are not (Magill & Wilcox, 2007). Moreover, substance abuse (cigarettes, alcohol, or illicitdrugs) can contribute to low birthweight, IUGR, pretermbirths, newborn addiction, and sepsis (March of Dimes,2007a). FIGURE20.3 Adolescent girls sharing time together.BOX 20.3 Possible Factors Contributing to Adolescent Pregnancy Early menarche Peer pressure to become sexually active Sexual or other abuse as a child Lack of accurate contraceptive information Fear of telling parents about sexual activity Feelings of invulnerability Poverty (85% of births occur in poor families) Culture or ethnicity (high incidence in Hispanic and African-American girls) Unprotected sex Low self-esteem and inability to negotiate Lack of appropriate role models Strong need for someone to love Drug use, truancy from school, or other behavioral problems Wish to escape a bad home situation Early dating without supervision Sources: March of Dimes, 2008; Langille, 2007.11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 592Although early childbearing (12 to 19 years of age) occurs in all socioeconomic groups, it is more prevalentamong poor women and those from minority back-grounds, who face more obstetric and newborn risks thantheir more affluent counterparts (March of Dimes,2007a). Poverty often contributes to delayed prenatal careand medical complications related to poor nutrition, suchas anemia. The nancial burden of adolescent pregnancy is high and costs taxpayers an estimated $7 billion to $15 billionannually in the United States (Alan Guttmacher Insti-tute, 2007). Much of the expense stems from Medicaid,food stamps, state health department maternity clinics,Aid to Families and Children, and direct payments tohealth care providers. However, this amount does not ad-dress the costs to society in terms of the loss of human re-sources and the far-reaching intergenerational effects ofadolescent parenting. For some adolescents, pregnancy may be seen as a hopeless situation: a grim story of poverty and lostdreams, of being trapped in a life that was never wanted.Health-related behaviors, such as smoking, diet, sexualbehavior, and help-seeking behaviors, that are developedduring adolescence often endure into later life (Goodmanet al., 2007). The consequences associated with an ado-lescent's less-than-optimal health status at this age due topregnancy can ultimately affect her long-term health andthat of her children. However, some adolescents can create a happy, sta- ble life for themselves and their children by facing theirchallenges and working hard to beat the odds. Recall Rose, the pregnant teenager with asthma. What issues would be important for the nurse to discuss with herrelated to her pregnancy, her asthma, and her age? Nursing Assessment Assessment of the pregnant adolescent is the same as thatfor any pregnant woman. However, when dealing withpregnant teens, the nurse also needs to ask: How does the girl see herself in the future? Are realistic role models available to her? How much does she know about child development? What nancial resources are available to her? Does she work? Does she go to school? What emotional support is available to her? Can she resolve conflicts and manage anger? What does she know about health and nutrition for herself and her child? Will she need help dealing with the challenges of the new parenting role? Does she need information about community resources?Having an honest regard for adolescents requires get- ting to know them and being able to appreciate the im-portant aspects of their life. Doing so forms a basis for thenurse's clinical judgment and promotes care that takesinto account the concerns and practical circumstances ofthe teen and her family. Skillful practice includes know-ing how and when to advise a teen and when to listen andrefrain from giving advice. Giving advice can be misinter-preted as \"preaching,\" and the adolescent will probablyignore the information. The nurse must be perceptive,flexible, and sensitive and must work to establish a ther-apeutic relationship. Nursing Management For adolescents, as for all women, pregnancy can be a physically, emotionally, and socially stressful time. Thepregnancy is often both the result of and cause of socialproblems and stressors that can be overwhelming to them. Nurses must support adolescents during thetransition from childhood into adulthood, which iscomplicated by their emergence into motherhood. As-sist the adolescent in identifying family and friends whowant to be involved and provide support throughoutthe pregnancy. Help the adolescent identify the options for this pregnancy, such as abortion, self-parenting of the child,temporary foster care for the baby or herself, or place-ment of the child for adoption. Explore with the ado-lescent why she became pregnant. Becoming aware ofwhy she decided to have a child is necessary to helpwith the development of the adolescent and her abilityto parent. Identify barriers to seeking prenatal care,such as lack of transportation, too many problems athome, financial concerns, the long wait for an appoint-ment, and lack of sensitivity on the part of the healthcare system. Encourage the girl to set goals and worktoward them. Assist her in returning to school and fur-thering her education. As appropriate, initiate a referralfor career or job counseling. Stress that the girl's physical well-being is impor- tant for both her and her developing fetus, which de-pends on her for its own health-related needs. Assistwith arrangements for care, including stress manage-ment and self-care. Having a healthy newborn eases the transition to motherhood somewhat, rather than having to deal withthe added stress of caring for an unhealthy baby (Secco et al., 2007). Monitor weight gain, sleep and rest patterns,and nutritional status to promote positive outcomes forboth. Stress the importance of attending prenatal educa-tion classes. Provide appropriate teaching based on theadolescent's developmental level and emphasize the im-portance of continued prenatal and follow-up care. Mon-itor maternal and fetal well-being throughout pregnancyand labor (Fig. 20.4).CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 59311223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 593Nurses can also play a major role in preventing ado- lescent pregnancies, perhaps by volunteering to talk toteen groups. Box 20.4 highlights the key areas for teach-ing adolescents about pregnancy prevention. Tackling the many issues surrounding adolescent pregnancy is difcult. Making connections with clients iscrucial regardless of how complex their situation is. Thefuture challenges nurses to nd solutions to teenage preg-nancies. Nurses must take proactive positions while work-ing with adolescents, parents, schools, and communitiesto reduce the problems associated with early childbearing.THE PREGNANT WOMAN OVER AGE 35 The term \"elderly primip\" is used to describe women ages 35 or older who are pregnant for the rst time. A fewdecades ago, a woman having a baby after the age of 35probably was giving birth to the last of several children,but today she may be having her rst. With advances intechnology and the tendency of women to seek career ad-vancement prior to childbearing, the dramatic increase inwomen having rst pregnancies after the age of 35 willlikely continue. Impact of Pregnancy on the Older Woman Whether childbearing is delayed by choice or by chance, starting a family at age 35 is different and not without risks.Women in this age group may already have chronic healthconditions that may put the pregnancy at risk. In addition,numerous studies have shown that increasing maternal ageis a risk factor for infertility and spontaneous abortions,gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia,preterm labor and birth, multiple pregnancy, genetic dis-orders and chromosomal abnormalities, placenta previa,IUGR, low Apgar scores, and surgical births (Hilton,2006). However, even though increased age implies in-creased complications, most women today who becomepregnant after age 35 have healthy pregnancies and healthynewborns (March of Dimes, 2007c). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the pregnant woman over age 35is the same as that for any pregnant woman. For a womanof this age, a preconception visit is important to identifychronic health problems that might affect the pregnancyand also to address lifestyle issues that may take time tomodify. Encourage the older woman to plan for the preg-nancy by seeing her health care provider before gettingpregnant to discuss preexisting medical conditions, med-ications, and lifestyle choices. Assess the woman for riskfactors such as cigarette smoking, poor nutrition, over-weight or underweight, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. A preconception visit also provides the opportunity to educate the woman about risk factors and provide infor-mation on how to modify her lifestyle habits to improvethe pregnancy outcome. Assist the woman with lifestylechanges so that she can begin pregnancy in an optimalstate of health. For example, if the woman is overweight,educate her about weight loss so that she can start thepregnancy at a healthy weight. If the woman smokes, en-courage smoking cessation to reduce the effects of nicotineon herself and her fetus. Prepare the woman for laboratory and diagnostic testing to establish a baseline for future comparisons. The FIGURE20.4 A pregnant adolescent receiving care during labor.

Amniocentesis is routinely of-fered to all older women to allow the early detection of numerous chromosomal abnormalities, including Downsyndrome. Additionally, a between 15 and 20 weeks of preg-nancy can be helpful in screening for Down syndrome andneural tube defects. Nursing Management During routine prenatal visits, the nurse can play a key role in promoting a healthy pregnancy. Consider social,genetic, and environmental factors that are unique to theolder pregnant women and prepare to address these fac-tors when providing care. Although research has shownincreases in preterm labor and births, low-birthweightnewborns, and operative interventions for older women,many carry their pregnancies to term without incident(Tough et al., 2007). Assess the woman's knowledge about risk factors and measures to reduce them. Educate her about measures topromote a positive outcome. Encourage her to get earlyand regular prenatal care. Advise her to eat a variety of nu-tritious foods, especially fortied cereals, enriched grainproducts, and fresh fruits and vegetables, and drink atleast six to eight glasses of water daily and to take the pre-scribed vitamin containing 400 micrograms of folic aciddaily. Also stress the need for her to avoid alcohol intakeduring pregnancy, avoid exposure to second-hand smoke,and take no drugs unless they are prescribed. Provide con-tinued surveillance of the mother and fetus throughoutthe pregnancy. WOMEN WHO ARE HIV POSITIVE Human immunodeciency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that is transmitted by blood and body fluids. The numberof people living with HIV infection in 2006 was estimatedat nearly 40 million, including approximately 20 millionwomen of childbearing age and 2.5 million children, mostof whom acquired HIV from mother-to-child transmis-sion (CDC, 2007a). Despite the revolutionary strides that have been made in treatment and detection and recent clinical advancesand cautious optimism associated with combination ther-apies and vaccines, the number of individuals who areHIV positive continues to climb worldwide. Intensive ef-forts notwithstanding, there still remains no real \"cure\"on the horizon (Lampe, 2006).Historically, HIV/AIDS was associated with the male homosexual community and intravenous drug users, butcurrently the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is now increasingmore rapidly among women than men. Women are thefastest-growing segment of persons becoming infectedwith HIV; transmission in women occurs most frequentlyfrom sexual contact (64%) and from intravenous drug use(33%) (CDC, 2007a). Most women, a large number ofwhom are mothers, have acquired the disease through het-erosexual contact. The risk of acquiring HIV through het-erosexual contact is greater for women due to exposure tothe higher viral concentration in semen. In addition, sex-ual intercourse may cause breaks in the vaginal lining, in-creasing the chances that the virus will enter the woman'sbody. Fifty percent of all the HIV/AIDS cases worldwideoccur in women. AIDS is the third leading cause of deathamong all U.S. women aged 25 to 44 years and the lead-ing cause of death among African-American women in thisage group (CDC, 2007a). Pathophysiology The three recognized modes of HIV transmission are un-protected sexual intercourse with an infected partner,contact with infected blood or blood products, and peri-natal transmission. HIV is not transmitted by doorknobs, faucets, toilets, dirty dishes, mosquitoes, wet towels, coughing or sneezing, shaking hands, orbeing hugged or by any other indirect method.Take NOTE! The virus attacks the T4 cells, decreases the CD4 cellcount, and disables the immune system. The HIV condi-tion can progress to a severe immunosuppressed statetermed acquired immunodeciency syndrome (AIDS) . AIDS is a progressive, debilitating disease that suppresses cellular immunity, predisposing the infectedperson to opportunistic infections and malignancies. TheCDC denes AIDS as an HIV-infected person with aspecic opportunistic infection or a CD4 count of lessthan 200. Eventually, death occurs. The time from infec-tion with HIV to development of AIDS is a median of 11 years but varies depending on whether the patient istaking current antiretroviral therapy (Johnsen, 2007). Re-search indicates that pregnancy does not accelerate theprogression of HIV to AIDS or death (Cressey & Lalle-mant, 2007). Once infected with HIV, the woman develops anti- bodies that can be detected with the enzyme-linked im-munosorbent assay (ELISA) and conrmed with theWestern blot test. Antibodies develop within 6 to 12 weeksCHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 59511223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 595596 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK after exposure, although this latent period is much longer in some women. Table 20.4 highlights the four stages ofHIV infection according to the CDC (2007a). Impact of HIV on Pregnancy When a woman who is infected with HIV becomes preg-nant, the risks to herself, her fetus, and the newborn aregreat. The risks are compounded by problems such asdrug abuse, lack of access to prenatal care, poverty,poor nutrition, and high-risk behaviors such as unsafesex practices and multiple sex partners, which can pre-dispose the woman to additional sexually transmittedinfections such as herpes, syphilis, or human papilloma-virus (HPV). Additional risk factors to assess for in-clude women who exchange sex for money or drugs or have sex partners who do; women whose past or presentsex partners were HIV infected; and women who had a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985 (U.S. Pre-ventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2006b). Sub-sequently, pregnant women who are HIV positive are atrisk for preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes,intrapartal or infec-tions (CDC, 2007a). Perinatal transmission of HIV (from the mother to the fetus or child) also can occur. However, such caseshave decreased in the past several years in the UnitedStates, primarily due to the use of zidovudine (ZDV) ther-apy in pregnant women infected with HIV. This has notbeen the case in poor countries without similar resources.The Joint United Nations programs on HIV/AIDS (UN-AIDS) estimates that over 600,000 new infections due tomother-to-child transmission occur annually. This num-ber is expected to increase rapidly as the prevalence risesin Southeast Asia (Johnsen, 2007). Perinatal transmission rates are as high as 35% when there is no intervention (an-tiretroviral therapy) and below 5% when antiretroviraltreatment and appropriate care are available. With perinatal transmission, approximately 25% to 50% of children manifest AIDS within the rst year of life,and about 80% have clinical symptoms of the diseasewithin 3 to 5 years (Johnsen, 2007). Breastfeeding is a majorcontributing factor for mother-to-child transmission, andthe infected mother must be informed about this (Daoet al., 2007). The U.S. Public Health Service recommendsthat women who are HIV positive should avoid breastfeed-ing to prevent HIV transmission to the newborn. Given thedevastating effects of HIV infection on children, preventingits transmission is critical (Lampe, 2006). In addition to perinatal transmission, the fetus and newborn also are at risk for prematurity, IUGR, lowbirthweight, and infection. Prompt treatment with anti-retroviral medications for the HIV-infected infant mayslow the progression of the disease. Therapeutic Management Women who are seropositive for HIV require counselingabout the risk of perinatal transmission and the potentialfor obstetric complications. The risk of perinatal trans-mission directly correlates with the viral load (Johnsen,2007). A discussion of the options on continuing thepregnancy, medication therapy, risks, perinatal out-comes, and treatment is warranted. Women who elect tocontinue with the pregnancy should be treated with an-tiretroviral therapy regardless of their CD4 count or viralload. Drug therapy is the mainstay of treatment for preg- nant women infected with HIV. The standard treatment is I II III IVStages Description Clinical Picture Acute infection Asymptomatic infection Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy End-stage disease (AIDS)Early stage with pervasive viral production Flu-like symptoms 2-4 weeks after exposureSigns and symptoms: weight loss, low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat, night sweats, and myalgia Viral replication continues within lymphatics Usually free of symptoms; lymphadenopathy Possibly remaining in this stage for years; AIDS develops in most within 7-10 years Opportunistic infections occur Severe immune deciency High viral load and low CD4 countsSigns and symptoms: bacterial, viral, or fungal opportunistic infections, fever, wasting syndrome, fatigue, neoplasms, andcognitive changesTABLE 20.4 STAGES OF HIV I NFECTION OUTLINED BY THE CDC11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 596oral antiretroviral drugs given twice daily from 14 weeks' gestation until giving birth, intravenous administrationduring labor, and oral syrup for the newborn in the rst 6 weeks of life (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Thegoal of therapy is to reduce the viral load as much as pos-sible, which reduces the risk of transmission to the fetus. Decisions about the birthing method to be used are made on an individual basis based on several factors involving the woman's health. Some reports suggest thatcesarean birth may reduce the risk of HIV infection(Johnsen, 2007). Efforts to reduce instrumentation, suchas avoiding the use of an episiotomy, fetal scalp electrodes,and fetal scalp sampling, will reduce the newborn's expo-sure to bodily fluids. With appropriate therapies, the prognosis for preg- nant women with HIV infection has improved signi-cantly. In addition, the newborns of women with HIVinfection who have received treatment usually do not be-come infected. Unfortunately, therapy is complicated andmedications are expensive. Moreover, the medications areassociated with numerous adverse effects and possibletoxic reactions. These therapies offer a dual purpose: re-duce the likelihood of mother-to-infant transmission andprovide optimal suppression of the viral load in the mother. The core goal of all medical therapy is to bring the client'sviral load to an undetectable level, thus minimizing therisk of transmission to the fetus and newborn. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment begins with a thorough history andphysical examination. In addition, the woman is offeredscreening for HIV antibodies. Health History and Physical Examination Review the woman's history for risk factors, such as unsafesex practices, multiple sex partners, and injectable druguse. Also have the woman complete a risk assessment sur-vey. In addition, question the woman about any flu-likesymptoms such as a low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat,night sweats, diarrhea, cough, skin lesions, or muscle pain. Perform a complete physical examination. Obtain the woman's weight and determine if she has lost weight re-cently. Assess for signs and symptoms of sexually trans-mitted of the increased risk for STIs.Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that allpregnant women be offered HIV antibody testing, re-gardless of their risk of infection, and that testing be doneduring the initial prenatal evaluation (Lampe, 2006).Testing is essential because treatments are available thatcan reduce the likelihood of perinatal transmission andmaintain the health of the woman. Women who request an HIV test despite reporting no individual risk factors should be considered at risk, since many are not likely to dis-close their high-risk behaviors.Take NOTE! Screening only women who are identied as high risk based on their histories is in- adequate due to the prolonged latency period that canexist after exposure. Also, research indicating thattreatment with antiretroviral agents could reduce verti-cal transmission from the infected mother to the new-born has dramatically increased the importance ofHIV antibody screening in pregnancy.Take NOTE! Offer all women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy HIV testing using ELISA. Prepare the womanwith a reactive screening test for an additional test, suchas the Western blot or an immunofluorescence assay.The Western blot is the conrmatory diagnostic test. Apositive antibody test conrmed by a supplemental testindicates that the woman has been infected with HIV andcan pass it on to others. HIV antibodies are detectable inat least 95% of women within 3 months after infection(Cressey & Lallemant, 2007). In addition to the usual screening tests done in normal pregnancy, additional testing for STIs may be necessary.Women infected with HIV have high Rousseau, 2007). Nursing Management Women infected with HIV should have comprehensive pre-natal care, which starts with pretest and posttest counseling.In pretest counseling, the client completes a risk assessmentsurvey and the nurse explains the meaning of positive ver-sus negative test results, obtains informed consent for HIVtesting, and educates the woman on how to prevent HIVinfection by changing lifestyle behaviors if needed. Posttestcounseling includes informing the client of the test results,reviewing the meaning of the results again, and reinforcingsafer sex guidelines. All pretest and posttest counselingshould be documented in the client's chart. Educating the Client Pregnant clients are dealing with many issues at their rstprenatal visit. The conrmation of pregnancy may be ac-CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 59711223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 597companied by feelings of joy, anxiety, depression, or other emotions. Simultaneously, the client is given manypamphlets and receives advice and counseling about many important health issues (e.g., nutrition, prenatal develop-ment, appointment schedules). This health teaching maybe done while the woman feels excited, tired, and anxious.To expect women to understand detailed explanations of acomplex disease entity (HIV/AIDS) too may be unrealistic.Determine the client's readiness for this discussion. Identify the client's individual needs for teaching, emo- tional support, and physical care. Approach education andcounseling of HIV-positive pregnant women in a caring,sensitive manner. Address the following information: Infection control issues at home Safer sex precautions Stages of the HIV disease process and treatment for each stage Symptoms of opportunistic infections Preventive drug therapies for her unborn infant Avoidance of breastfeeding Referrals to community support, counseling, and nancial aid Client's support system and potential caretaker Importance of continual prenatal care Need for a well-balanced diet Measures to reduce exposure to infections Be knowledgeable about HIV infection and how HIV is transmitted and share this knowledge with all women.Nurses also can work to influence legislators, public healthofcials, and the entire health establishment toward poli-cies to address the HIV epidemic. Research toward treat-ment and cure is tremendously important, but the majorkey to prevention of the spread of the virus is education.Nurses play a major role in this education. Supporting the Client Be aware of the psychosocial sequelae of HIV/AIDS. Adiagnosis of HIV can put a woman into an emotional tail-spin, where she is worried about her own health and thatof her unborn infant. She may experience grief, fear, oranxiety about the future of her children. Along with themedications that are so important to her health mainte-nance, address the woman's mental health needs, familydynamics, capacity to work, and social concerns and pro-vide appropriate support and guidance. Be aware of your personal beliefs and attitudes to- ward women who are HIV positive or have AIDS. Incor-porate this awareness in your actions as you help thewoman face the reality of the diagnosis and treatment op-tions. Empathy, understanding, caring, and assistanceare key to helping the client and her family. Preparing for Labor, Birth, and Afterward Current evidence suggests that cesarean birth performedbefore the onset of labor and before the rupture of mem-branes signicantly reduces the rate of perinatal transmis- sion. ACOG recommends that HIV-positive women beoffered elective cesarean birth to reduce the rate of trans-mission beyond that which may be achieved throughantiretroviral therapy. They further suggest that operativebirths be performed at 38 weeks' gestation and that am-niocentesis be avoided to prevent contamination of theamniotic fluid with maternal blood. Decisions concern-ing the method of delivery should be based on the woman's viral load, the duration of ruptured membranes, theprogress of labor, and other pertinent clinical factors(USPHSTF, 2006b). Prepare the woman physically and emotionally for the possibility of cesarean birth and assist as necessary. Ensurethat she understands the rationale for the surgical birth. After the birth of the newborn, the motivation for tak- ing antiretroviral medications may be lower, thus affectingthe woman's compliance with therapy. Encourage thewoman to continue therapy for her own sake as well as thatof the newborn. Nurses can make a difference in helpingwomen to adhere to their complex drug regimens. Reinforce family planning methods during this time, incorporating a realistic view of her disease status. The useof oral contraceptives with concurrent use of condoms isrecommended (Lampe, 2006). Advise the woman thatbreastfeeding is not recommended. Instruct the HIV-positive woman in self-care measures, including theproper method for disposing of perineal pads to reducethe risk of exposing others to infected body fluids. Finally,teach the HIV-positive woman the signs and symptoms ofinfection in newborns and infants, encouraging her to re-port any to the health care provider. When providing direct care, ALWAYS follow standard precautions.Take NOTE! THE PREGNANT WOMAN WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE Perinatal drug abuse is the use of alcohol and other drugs by pregnant women. The incidence of substanceabuse during pregnancy is highly variable because mostpregnant women are reluctant to reveal the extent of theiruse. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that6% of the women in the United States have used illicitdrugs while pregnant. These include cocaine, marijuana,heroin, and psychotherapeutic drugs that were not pre-scribed by a health care professional. More than 18%used alcohol and 21% smoked cigarettes during theirpregnancy (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA],2007a).598 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 598Impact of Substance Abuse on Pregnancy The use of drugs, legal or not, increases the risk of med- ical complications in the mother and poor birth outcomesin the newborn. The placenta acts as an active transportmechanism, not as a barrier, and substances pass from amother to her fetus through the placenta. Thus, the fetusas well as the mother experiences substance use, abuse,and addiction. Additionally, fetal vulnerability to drugs ismuch greater because the fetus has not developed the en-zymatic system needed to metabolize drugs (Hackley,Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). A woman who claims to have taken no drugs while pregnant may be unaware that substances such as hairdye, diet cola, paint, or over-the-counter (OTC) medica-tions for colds or headaches are still considered drugs.Thus, it is very difcult to get a true picture of the real useof drugs by pregnant women. Many drugs are considered to have a teratogenic effect on growing fetuses. A teratogen is any environmental sub- stance that can cause physical defects in the developing em-bryo and fetus. Pregnant women with substance abusecommonly present with polysubstance abuse, which is likelyto be more damaging than the use of any single substance.Thus, it is inherently difcult to ascribe a specic perinataleffect to any one substance (Rassool & Villar-Luis, 2006). Effects of Addiction Addiction is a multifaceted process that is affected by en-vironmental, psychological, family, and physical factors.Women who use drugs, alcohol, or tobacco come from allsocioeconomic backgrounds, cultures, and lifestyles. Fac-tors associated with substance abuse during a pregnancymay include low self-esteem, inadequate support systems,low self-expectations, high levels of anxiety, socioeco nomic barriers, involvement in abusive relationships, chaotic fa- milial and social systems, and a history of psy chiatric illness or depression. Women often become substance abusers torelieve their anxieties, depression, and feelings of worth-lessness (Jones, 2006). Societal attitudes regarding women and substance abuse may prohibit them from admitting the problem andseeking treatment. Society sanctions women for failing tolive up to expectations of how a pregnant woman \"should\"behave, thereby possibly driving them further away fromthe treatment they so desperately need. For many reasons,pregnant women who abuse substances feel unwelcome inprenatal clinics or medical settings. Often they seek pre-natal care late or not at all. They may fear being shamedor reported to legal or child protection authorities. A non-judgmental atmosphere and unbiased teaching to all preg-nant women regardless of their lifestyle is crucial. A caring,concerned manner is critical to help these women feel safeand respond honestly to assessment questions. Pregnancy can be a motivator for some who want to try treatment. The goal of therapy is to help the clientdeal with pregnancy by developing a trusting relation- ship. Providing a full spectrum of medical, social, andemotional care is needed. Effects of Commonly Abused Substances Substance abuse during pregnancy, particularly in the rst trimester, has a negative effect on the health of the motherand the growth and development of the fetus. The fetusexperiences the same systemic effects as the mother, butoften more severely. The fetus cannot metabolize drugs asefciently as the expectant mother and will experience theeffects long after the drugs have left the women's system.Substance abuse during pregnancy is associated withpreterm labor, abortion, IUGR, abruptio placentae, lowbirthweight, neurobehavioral abnormalities, and childhood developmental (Rassool &Villar-Luis, 2006). Table 20.5 summarizes the effects ofselected drugs during pregnancy.

Alcohol is a teratogen, a substance known to betoxic to human development. Approximately 10% of preg-nant women report alcohol consumption (CDC, 2007d).Theoretically, no mother would give a glass of wine, beer,or hard liquor to her newborn, but when she drinks, herembryo or fetus is exposed to the same blood alcohol con-centration as she is. The teratogenic effects of heavy mater-nal drinking have been recognized since 1973, when fetalalcohol syndrome was rst described. Fetal alcohol syn-drome is now a classication under the broader term offetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) ; this disorder includes the full range of birth defects, such as structuralanomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilitiescaused by prenatal exposure to alcohol (Green, 2007). Theincidence of FASD in the United States is estimated to beone or two cases per 1,000 live births (National Organiza-tion on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome [NoFAS], 2007). It is theleading cause of mental retardation (CDC, 2007d). Not every woman who drinks during pregnancy will give birth to an affected child. Based on the best researchavailable, the following is known about alcohol consump-tion during pregnancy: Intake increases the risk of alcohol-related birth de- fects, including growth deciencies, facial abnormali-ties, central nervous system impairment, behavioraldisorders, and intellectual development. No amount of alcohol consumption is considered safe during pregnancy. Damage to the fetus can occur at any stage of preg- nancy, even before a woman knows she is pregnant. Cognitive defects and behavioral problems resulting from prenatal exposure are lifelong. Alcohol-related birth defects are completely preventa- ble (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services[USDHHS], 2007). Risk factors for giving birth to an alcohol-affected newborn include maternal age, socioeconomic status, eth-nicity, genetic factors, poor nutrition, depression, familydisorganization, unplanned pregnancy, and late prenatalcare (Hackley, Kriebs, & Rousseau, 2007). Identicationof risk factors strongly associated with alcohol-relatedbirth outcomes could help identify high-risk pregnanciesrequiring intervention. Characteristics of FASD include craniofacial dysmor- phia (thin upper lip, small and smalleyes), IUGR, microcephaly, and congenital anomalies suchas limb abnormalities and cardiac defects. Long-term sequelae include postnatal growth restriction, attentiondecits, delayed reaction time, and poor scholastic per-formance (NoFAS, 2007). The complex neurobehavioralproblems typically manifest themselves insidiously. Chil-dren with prenatal alcohol exposure struggle with cognitive,academic, social, emotional, and behavioral challenges.These challenges reduce the child's ability to learn and function successfully in many structured environments(Green, 2007). Common cognitive and behavioral prob-lems are listed in Box 20.5, and Figure 20.5 illustrates thecharacteristic facial features. See Chapter 24 for a more de-tailed discussion of the newborn with FASD. One of the biggest challenges in determining the true prevalence of FASD is how to recognize the syndrome,which depends in part on the age and physical featuresof the person being assessed. Difficulty in identifying alcohol abuse is due to the client's denial of alcohol use,unwillingness to report alcohol consumption, under-reporting, and limited ability to recollect the frequency,quantity, and type of alcohol consumed. This makes itdifficult to identify women who are drinking duringpregnancy, institute preventive measures, or refer themfor treatment. Women who drink excessively while pregnant are at high risk for giving birth to children with birth defects. Toprevent these defects, women should stop drinking during BOX 20.5 Common Cognitive and Behavioral Problems Associated With FASD Attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Inability to foresee consequences Inability to learn from previous experience Lack of organization Learning difculties Poor abstract thinking Poor impulse control Speech and language problems Poor judgment Low nasal bridge Short palpebral fissures Short nose Flat midface Epicanthal folds Minor ear abnormalities Thin upper lip Receding jaw FIGURE20.5 Typical facial characteristics of a newborn with FASD.600 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 600all phases of a pregnancy. Unfortunately, many women continue to drink during their pregnancy despite warn-ings from professionals. Currently, it is not known whether there is a mini- mal amount of alcohol safe to drink during pregnancy;an occasional glass of wine might be harmless or mightnot be. Therefore, eliminating alcohol consumption dur-ing pregnancy is the ultimate goal to prevent FASD.Most women know they shouldn't drink during preg-nancy, but the \"window of vulnerability\"\u2014the time lagbetween conception and the discovery of pregnancy\u2014may put substantial numbers of children at risk. Addi-tionally, traditional alcohol-screening questionnaires,such as the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test(MAST) and the CAGE Questionnaire, are not sensitiveenough to detect low levels of alcohol consumptionamong women. Several challenges remain in preventing birth defects due to alcohol consumption: Ways to improve clinical recognition of high-risk women who drink alcohol Ways to intervene more effectively to modify drinking behaviors In utero approaches to prevent or minimize fetal injury Strategies to address the neurodevelopmental prob- lems of children affected by maternal alcohol ingestion Caffeine Caffeine, a CNS stimulant, is present in varying amountsin such common products as coffee, tea, colas, and choco-late. It is also in cold remedies and analgesics. Birth de-fects have not been linked to caffeine consumption, butmaternal coffee consumption decreases iron absorptionand may increase the risk of anemia during pregnancy.The FDA recommends that pregnant women eliminate orlimit their consumption of caffeine to less than 300 mg/day,or the equivalent of three cups of coffee or cola (Hoffman& Brown, 2006). Nicotine Nicotine, found in cigarettes, is another substance that isharmful to the pregnant women and her fetus. Nicotine,which causes vasoconstriction, transfers across the pla-centa and reduces blood flow to the fetus, contributing tofetal hypoxia. When compared with alcohol, marijuana,and other illicit drug use, tobacco use is less likely to de-cline as the pregnancy progresses (Wang, 2007). Smokingis associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However,these adverse outcomes can be avoided if the woman stopssmoking before becoming pregnant. Smoking increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm labor and birth, maternal hypertension, placentaprevia, and abruptio placentae. The perinatal death rateamong to 35% higher(Raatikainen, Huurinainen, & Heinonen, 2007).Smoking has also been considered an important risk factor for low birthweight, sudden infant death syndrome(SIDS), and cognitive decits, especially in language, read-ing, and vocabulary, as well as poorer performances on testsof reasoning and memory. Researchers have also reportedbehavior problems, such as increased activity, inattention,impulsivity, opposition, and aggression (Wang, 2007). Women who smoke during the pregnancy also con- tinue to smoke after giving birth, and thus the infant willbe exposed to nicotine after birth. This environmental orpassive exposure affects the child's development and in-creases the risk of childhood respiratory disorders. Cocaine Cocaine use is second only to marijuana in women whoabuse drugs during pregnancy. The incidence of cocaineexposure in utero is 1 to 10 per 1,000 live births (Weekes& Lee, 2006). Cocaine is a psychoactive drug derived from the leaves of the coca plant, which grows in the Andes Mountains ofPeru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. The freebase form, called\"crack\" because of the cracking or popping noise made inits preparation, is less expensive, easily made, and smok-able. Cocaine is a powerful vasoconstrictor. When sniffedinto the mucous membranes of the nose, it produces anintense \"rush\" that some have compared to an orgasmicexperience. Smoked crack is absorbed rapidly by the pul-monary vasculature and reaches the brain's circulation in6 to 8 seconds (NIDA, 2007b). Cocaine use produces vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypertension in both the mother and the fetus (Weekes& Lee, 2006). Uteroplacental insufciency may result fromreduced blood flow and placental perfusion. Chronic usecan result in low birthweight, the most common effect ofcocaine use in pregnancy (NIDA, 2007b). Studies suggest that perinatal cocaine use increases the risk of preterm labor, abortion, abruptio placentae, IUGR,intrauterine fetal distress and demise, seizures, withdrawal,and cerebral infarcts. Cocaine may increase the risk of uter-ine rupture and congenital anomalies (NIDA, 2007b).Fetal anomalies associated with cocaine use in early preg-nancy involve neurologic problems such as neural tube de-fects and microcephaly; cardiovascular anomalies such ascongenital heart genitourinary such asprune belly syndrome, ambiguousgenitalia; and gastrointestinal system problems such asnecrotizing enterocolitis (Jones, 2006). Some infants ex-posed to cocaine in utero show increased irritability and aredifcult to calm and soothe to sleep. Marijuana Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in Amer-ica, with over 90 million people having tried it at leastonce. It is often called pot, reefer, herb, widow, hash, grass,weed, Mary Jane, or MJ (NIDA, 2007c). Marijuana is apreparation of the leaves and flowering tops of Cannabis CHAPTER 20 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AT RISK: SELECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 60111223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 601sativa, the hemp plant, a number of pharmacologically active agents. Tetrahydrocannabi-nol (THC) is the most active ingredient of marijuana.With heavy smoking, THC narrows the bronchi andbronchioles and produces inflammation of the mucousmembranes. Smoking marijuana causes tachycardia anda reduction in blood pressure, resulting in orthostatichypotension. The effects of marijuana smoking on pregnancy are not yet fully understood because there are very few studieson its long-term effects on child development. One canspeculate that the effects of marijuana on the immaturenervous system may be subtle and not detected until morecomplex functions are required, usually in a formal edu-cational setting. There is some evidence that marijuanaincreases the risk of spontaneous abortion and pretermdelivery (Barros et al., 2006). Although marijuana is notconsidered teratogenic, many newborns display alteredresponses to visual stimuli, increased tremulousness, anda high-pitched cry, which might indicate CNS insults(Wang, 2007). A strong correlation exists between the useof marijuana and the use of alcohol and cigarettes. Opiates and Narcotics Opiates and narcotics include opium, heroin (known ashorse, junk, smack, dollies). These drugs are central nervous system depressants that soothe and lull. They may be used med-ically for pain, but all have a high potential for abuse.Most cause an intense addiction in both mother andnewborn. Narcotic dependence is particularly problematic in pregnant women. It leads to medical, nutritional, and so-cial neglect by the woman due to the long-term risks ofphysical dependence, malnutrition, compromised immu-nity, hepatitis, and fatal overdose (Alexander et al., 2007).Taking opiates or narcotics during pregnancy places thewoman at increased risk for preterm labor, IUGR, andpreeclampsia (Wang, 2007). Heroin is the most common illicitly used opioid. It is derived from the seeds of the poppy plant and can besniffed, smoked, or injected. It crosses the placenta viasimple diffusion within 1 hour of maternal consumption(Dodge, Brady, & Maguire, 2007). Use of heroin duringpregnancy is believed to affect the developing brain of thefetus and may cause behavioral abnormalities in child-hood (Alexander et al., 2007). The most common harmful effect of heroin and other narcotics on newborns is withdrawal, or neonatal absti- nence syndrome (see Chapter 24). This collection of symptoms may include irritability, hypertonicity, a high-pitched cry, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, dis-turbed sleeping, sneezing, diaphoresis, fever, poor sucking,tremors, and seizures (Ebner et al., 2007).Withdrawal from opiates during pregnancy is ex- tremely dangerous for the fetus, so a prescribed oral methadone maintenance program combined with psy-chotherapy is recommended for the pregnant woman.This closely supervised treatment program reduces with-drawal symptoms in the newborn, reduces drug cravings,and blocks the euphoric effects of narcotic drugs in orderto reduce illicit drug use. Methadone maintenance pro-vides a steady state of opiate levels, thus reducing the riskof withdrawal to the fetus and exposure to HIV and otherSTIs because the mother is no longer injecting drugs.However, methadone has the same withdrawal conse-quences for women and newborns as heroin does (Burnset al., 2007). Sedatives Sedatives relax the central nervous system and are usedmedically for inducing relaxation and sleep, relieving ten-sion, and treating seizures. Sedatives easily cross the placenta and can cause birth defects and behavioral prob-lems. Infants born to mothers who abuse sedatives dur-ing pregnancy may be physically dependent on the drugsthemselves and are more prone to respiratory problems,feeding difculties, disturbed sleep, sweating, irritability,and fever (Alexander et al., 2007). Methamphetamines Methamphetamine use among pregnant women has in-creased rapidly in the United States. This highly addic-tive stimulant is commonly known as speed, meth, orchalk. In its smoked form, it is often referred to as ice,crystal, crank, and glass. It is a white, odorless, bitter-tasting powder that was developed from its parent drug,amphetamine, and was used originally in nasal deconges-tants and bronchial inhalers. The maternal effects in-clude increased energy and alertness, an intense rush,decreased appetite, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Chronicuse can lead to psychosis, including paranoia, hallucina-tions, memory loss, and aggressive or violent behavior(Derlet & Albertson, 2006). Few studies have been doneon the effects of methamphetamine abuse during preg-nancy, but the few done indicate an increased risk forpreterm births, placental abruption, fetal growth restric-tion, and congenital anomalies (NIDA, 2007d). Thesendings are hard to interpret, however, due to small sam-ple size and polydrug use of the participants. Nursing Assessment Complete a thorough history and physical examinationto evaluate a client for substance use and abuse. Sub-stance abuse screening in pregnancy is done to detect theuse of any substance known or suspected to exert a dele-terious effect on the client or her fetus. Routinely askabout substance abuse with all women of childbearingage, inform them of the risks involved, and advise them602 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK11223-20_CH20.qxd 8/4/08 3:03 PM Page 602against continuing. Screening questionnaires are helpful in identifying potential users, may reduce the stigma ofasking clients about substance abuse, and result in amore accurate and consistent evaluation. The questionsin Box 20.6 may be helpful in assessing a client who isat risk for substance abuse during pregnancy. Using \"ac-cepting\" terminology may encourage the woman to givehonest answers without fear of reproach. A urine toxicology screen may also be helpful in de- termining drug use, although a urine screen identiesonly recent or heavy use of drugs. The length of time adrug is present in urine is as follows: Cocaine: 24 to 48 hours in an adult, 72 to 96 hours in an infant Heroin: 24 hours in an adult, 24 to 48 hours in an infant Marijuana: 1 week to 1 month in an adult, up to a month or longer in an infant Methadone: up to 10 days in an infant (Wang, 2007) Nursing Management If the woman's drug screen is positive, use this as an op-portunity to discuss prenatal exposure to substances thatmay be harmful. The discussion may lead the nurse torefer the client for a diagnostic assessment or identify anintervention such as counseling that may be helpful. Beingnonjudgmental is a key to success; a client is more apt totrust and reveal patterns of abuse if the nurse does not judge her and her lifestyle choices. A positive drug screen in a newborn warrants an in- vestigation by the state protection agency. In the interim,institute measures to reduce stress and stimuli to pro-mote the newborn's comfort (see Chapter 24 for a morein-depth discussion). Be proactive, supportive, and accepting when caring for the client. Assure women with substance abuse prob-lems that sharing information of a condential naturewith health care providers will not render them liable to criminal prosecution. Provide counseling and education,emphasizing the following: Effects of substance exposure on the fetus Interventions to improve mother-child attachment and improve parenting Psychosocial support if treatment is needed to reduce substance abuse Referral to outreach programs to improve access to treatment facilities Hazardous legal substances to avoid during pregnancy Follow-up of children born to substance-dependent mothers Dietary counseling to improve the pregnancy outcome for both mother and child Drug screening to identify all drugs a client is using More frequent prenatal visits to monitor fetal well- being Maternal and fetal benets of remaining drug-free Cultural sensitivity Coping skills, support systems, and vocational assistance Substance abuse is a complex problem that requires sensitivity to each woman's unique situation and contribut-ing factors. Be sure to address individual psychological andsociocultural factors to help the woman to regain control ofher life. Treatment must combine different approaches andprovide ongoing support for women learning to live drug-free. Developing personal strengths, such as communica-tion skills and assertiveness, and self-condence will helpthe woman in resisting the drug use. Encourage the use ofappropriate coping skills. Enhancing self-esteem also helpsprovides a foundation to avoid drugs. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Preconception counseling for the woman with diabetes is helpful in promoting blood glucose control to pre-vent congenital anomalies. /H18546The classication system for diabetes commonly used is based on disease etiology and not pharmacology man-agement; the classication includes type 1 diabetes, type2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and impaired fastingglucose and impaired glucose tolerance. /H18546A functional classication for heart disease during pregnancy is based on past and present disability: class I,BOX 20.6 Sample Questions for Assessing Substance Use Have you ever used recreational drugs? If so, when and what? Have you ever taken a prescription drug other than as intended? What are your feelings about drug use during pregnancy? How often do you smoke cigarettes? How many per day? How often do you drink alcohol?If the assessment reveals substance use, obtain additional information by using the RAFFT questions, which are asensitive screening instrument for identifying substanceabuse (Weekes & Lee, 2006):R:Do you drink or take drugs to Relax, improve your self-image, or t in? A:Do you ever drink or take drugs while Alone? F:Do you have any close Friends who drink or take drugs? F:Does a close Family member have a problem with alcohol or drugs?

Consider the woman who has had a problem-free preg- nancy and then suddenly develops a condition duringlabor, changing a routine situation into a possible crisis.Many complications occur with little or no warning andpresent challenges for the perinatal health care team as well as the family. The nurse plays a major role in identi-fying the problem quickly and coordinating immediateintervention, ultimately achieving a positive outcome. National Health Goals address maternal and new- born outcomes involving complications of labor and birthand cesarean birth (USDHHS, 2000). These goals are highlighted in Healthy People 2010 21.1. This chapter will address several conditions occur- ring during labor and birth that may increase the risk of an adverse outcome for the mother and fetus. It also de-scribes birth-related procedures that may be necessary forthe woman who develops a condition that increases herrisk or that may be needed to reduce the woman's risk fordeveloping a condition, thus promoting optimal maternaland fetal outcomes. Nursing management of the womanand her family focuses on professional support and com-passionate care. Dystocia Dystocia , dened as abnormal or difcult labor, can be influenced by a vast number of maternal and fetal factors. Dystocia is said to exist when the progress of labor devi- ates from normal; it is characterized by a slow and abnor-mal progression of labor. It occurs in approximately 8% to 11% of all labors and is the leading indicator for pri-mary cesarean birth in the United States (Joy & Lyon, 2007). To characterize a labor as abnormal, a basic under- standing of normal labor is essential. Normal labor startswith regular uterine contractions that are strong enoughto result in cervical effacement and dilation. Early inlabor, uterine contractions are irregular and cervical ef-facement and dilation occur gradually. When cervical di-lation reaches 4 cm and uterine contractions becomemore powerful, the active phase of labor begins. It is usu-ally during the active phase that dystocia becomes appar-ent. Because dystocia cannot be predicted or diagnosedwith certainty, the term \"failure to progress\" is oftenused. This term includes lack of progressive cervical di-lation, lack of descent of the fetal head, or both. An ade-quate trial of labor is needed to declare with condencethat dystocia or \"failure to progress\" exists. Early identication of and prompt interventions for dystocia are essential to minimize risk to the woman andfetus. According to American College of Obstetrics andGynecology (ACOG, 2003a), factors associated with an increased risk epidural analgesia, ex-cessive analgesia, ineffective maternal pushing technique,occiput posterior position, longer rst stage of labor, nul-liparity, short maternal stature (less than 5 feet tall), fetal birth weight (more than 8.8 lb), shoulder dystocia, ab-normal fetal presentation or position (breech), fetal anom-alies (hydrocephalus), maternal age older than 35 years, gestational age more than 41 weeks, chorioamnionitis, ineffective uterine contractions, and high fetal station atcomplete cervical dilation. Dystocia can result from problems or abnormalities involving the expulsive forces (known as the \"powers\"); presentation, position, and fetal development (the \"pas-senger\"); the maternal bony pelvis or birth canal (the \"pas-sageway\"); and maternal stress (the \"psyche\"). Table 21.1summarizes the diagnosis, therapeutic management, andnursing management of the common problems associatedwith dystocia. PROBLEMS WITH THE POWERS When the expulsive forces of the uterus become dysfunc- tional, the uterus may either never fully relax (hypertoniccontractions), placing the fetus in jeopardy, or relax too much (hypotonic contractions), causing ineffective con- tractions.

Subse-quently, contractions are erratic and poorly coordinatedbecause more than one uterine pacemaker is sending sig-nals for contraction. Placental perfusion becomes com-promised, thereby reducing oxygen to the fetus. Thesehypertonic contractions exhaust the mother, who is expe-riencing frequent, intense, and painful contractions withlittle progression. This dysfunctional pattern occurs inearly labor and affects nulliparous women more thanmultiparous women (Cheng & Caughey, 2007). Hypotonic uterine dysfunction occurs during active labor (dilation more than 4 cm) when contractionsbecome poor in quality and lack sufcient intensity to di-late and efface the cervix. The major risk with this compli-cation is hemorrhage after giving birth because the uteruscannot contract effectively to compress blood vessels. Precipitous labor is one that is completed in less than 3 hours. Women experiencing precipitous labor typicallyhave soft perineal tissues that stretch readily, permitting thefetus to pass through the pelvis quickly and easily. Mater-nal complications are rare if the maternal pelvis is adequateand the soft tissues yield to a fast fetal descent. Potentialfetal complications may include head trauma, such as in-tracranial hemorrhage or nerve damage, and hypoxia dueto the rapid progression of labor (Sharf et al., 2007). PROBLEMS WITH THE PASSENGER Any presentation other than occiput anterior or a slight variation of the fetal position or size increases the probabil-ity of dystocia. These variations can affect the contractionsor fetal descent through the maternal pelvis. Commonproblems involving the fetus include occiput posterior po-sition, breech cephalopelvic dispropor-tion (CPD), and structural anomalies. Persistent occiput posterior is the most common mal- position, occurring in about 15% of laboring women. Thereasons for this malposition are often unclear. This posi-tion presents slightly larger diameters to the maternalpelvis, thus slowing fetal descent. A fetal head that ispoorly flexed may be responsible. In addition, poor uter-ine contractions may not push the fetal head down into thepelvic floor to the extent that the fetal occiput sinks into itrather than being pushed to rotate in an anterior direction. Face and brow presentations are rare and are associ- ated with fetal abnormalities (anencephaly), pelvic con-tractures, high parity, placenta previa, hydramnios, lowbirthweight, or a large fetus (WHO, 2007). Breech presentation, which occurs in 3% to 4% of labors, is frequently associated with multifetal pregnancies,grand multiparity (more than ve births), advanced mater-nal age, placenta previa, hydramnios, preterm births, and fetal anomalies such as hydrocephaly (Lee, El-Sayed, &Gould, 2007). In a persistent breech presentation, an in-creased frequency of prolapsed cord, placenta previa, lowbirthweight from preterm birth, fetal or anomalies,and perinatal morbidity and mortality from a difcult birthmay occur (Cunningham et al., 2005). Perinatal mortalityis increased two- to four-fold with a breech presentation,regardless of the mode of delivery (Lee, El-Sayed, &Gould, 2007). Shoulder dystocia is dened as the obstruction of fetal descent and birth by the axis of the fetal shouldersafter the fetal head has been delivered. The incidence ofshoulder dystocia is increasing due to increasing birth-weight, with reports of it in up to 2% of vaginal births. Itis one of the most anxiety-provoking emergencies en-countered in labor. Failure of the shoulders to deliverspontaneously places both the woman and the fetus atrisk for injury. Postpartum hemorrhage, secondary touterine atony or vaginal lacerations, is the major compli-cation to the mother. Transient Erb's or Duchenne'sbrachial plexus palsies and clavicular or humeral the most common fetal injuries encounteredwith shoulder dystocia (WHO, 2007). Newborns experi-encing shoulder dystocia typically have greater shoulder-to-head and chest-to-head disproportions compared withthose delivered without dystocia (Cunningham et al.,2005). Prompt recognition and appropriate manage-ment, such as with McRobert's maneuver or suprapubicpressure, can reduce the severity of injuries to the motherand newborn (Fig. 21.1). Prompt recognition and appropriate man- agement of shoulder dystocia can reduce the severity of injuries to the mother and infant. Imme-diately assess the infant for signs of trauma such as afractured clavicle, Erb's palsy, or neonatal asphyxia.Assess the mother for excessive vaginal bleeding andblood in the urine from bladder trauma.Take NOTE! Multiple gestation refers to twins, triplets, or more infants within a single pregnancy (Box 21.1). The inci-dence is increasing, primarily as a result of infertilitytreatment (both ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertiliza-tion) and an increased number of women giving birth atolder ages (March of Dimes, 2007b). The incidence oftwins is approximately 1 in 30 conceptions, with abouttwo thirds of them due to the fertilization of two ova(dizygotic or fraternal) and about one third occurringfrom the splitting of one fertilized ovum (monozygotic oridentical twins). One in approximately 8,100 Dimes, 2007b). The most11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 619620 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK common maternal complication is postpartum hemor- rhage resulting from uterine atony. Excessive fetal size and abnormalities can also con- tribute to labor and birth dysfunctions. Macrosomia , in which a newborn weighs 4,000 to 4,500 g (8.13 to 9.15 lb)or more at birth, complicates approximately 10% of allpregnancies (Jazayeri & Contreras, 2007). Fetal abnor-malities may include hydrocephalus, ascites, or a largemass on the neck or head. Complications associated withdystocia related to excessive fetal size and anomalies in-clude an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage, dys-functional labor, fetopelvic disproportion, soft tissuelaceration during fetal injuries or fractures,and asphyxia (Joy & Lyon, 2007). PROBLEMS WITH THE PASSAGEWAY Problems with the passageway (pelvis and birth canal) are related to a contraction of one or more of the three planesof the maternal pelvis: inlet, midpelvis, and outlet. Thefemale pelvis can be classied into four types based onthe shape of the pelvic inlet, which is bounded anteriorlyby the posterior border of sacral promontory, and laterally four basic types are gynecoid, anthro-poid, android, and platypelloid (see Chapter 12 for addi-tional information). Contraction of the midpelvis is morecommon than inlet contraction and typically causes anarrest of fetal descent. Obstructions in the maternal birthcanal, such as swelling of the soft maternal tissue andcervix, termed soft tissue dystocia, also can hamper fetalFIGURE21.1 Maneuvers to relieve shoulder dystocia. ( A) McRobert's maneuver. The mother's thighsare flexed muchas possible to straighten the pelviccurve. ( B) Suprapubic pressure. Pressure is applied just above thepubic bone, pushing the fetal an-terior shoulder downward to dis-place it from above the mother'ssymphysis pubis. The newborn'shead is depressed toward themother's anus while suprapubicpressure is applied. AB BOX 21.1 Multiple Gestation As the name implies, multiple gestation involves more than one fetus. These fetuses can result from fertilizationof a single ovum or multiple ova. Twin pregnancies thatare single-ovum conceptions (monozygotic twins) shareone chorion (membrane closest to the uterus), and eachtwin has his or her own amnion (membrane surroundingthe amniotic fluid). One fertilized ovum splits into twoseparate individuals who are said to be natural clones.They have separate amniotic sacs and placentas, areidentical in appearance, and are always the same gender.Twin pregnancies that are multiple-ova conceptions(dizygotic twins) result from two ova fertilized by twosperm. Genetically, dizygotic twins are as alike (or unlike) as any other pair or siblings. The fetuses of a twin gestation, whether monozygotic or dizygotic, are slightly \"squashed\" because two fetusesdevelop in a space usually occupied by one. This com-pression is reflected in the slowing of weight gain inboth twins compared to that for singletons (Zach & Pramanik, 2007). Multiple births other than twins can be of the identi- cal type, the fraternal type, or combinations of the two.Triplets can occur from the division of one zygote intotwo, with one dividing again, producing identical triplets,or they can come from two zygotes, one dividing into aset of identical twins, and the second zygote developingas a single fraternal sibling, or from three separate zygotes. Triplets are said to occur once in 7,000 birthsand quadruplets once in 660,000 births (March ofDimes, 2007b). In recent years, fertility drugs used to induce ovulation have resulted in a greater frequency ofquadruplets, quintuplets, sextuplets, and even octuplets.11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 620CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 621 descent and impede labor progression outside the mater- nal bony pelvis. PROBLEMS WITH THE PSYCHE Many women experience an array of emotions during labor, which may include fear, anxiety, helplessness,being alone, and weariness. These emotions can lead topsychological stress, which indirectly can cause dystocia. Nursing Assessment Begin the assessment by reviewing the client's history to look for risk factors for dystocia. Include in the assessmentthe mother's frame of mind to identify fear, anxiety, stress,lack of support, and pain, which can interfere with uter-ine contractions and impede labor progress. Helping thewoman to relax will promote normal labor progress. Assess the woman's vital signs. Note any elevation in temperature (might suggest an infection) or changes inheart rate or blood pressure (might signal hypovolemia).Evaluate the uterine contractions for frequency and inten-sity. Question the woman about any changes in her con-traction pattern, such as a decrease or increase in frequencyor intensity, and report these. Assess fetal heart rate andpattern, reporting any abnormal patterns immediately. Assess fetal position via Leopold's maneuvers to iden- tify any deviations in presentation or position, and reportany deviations. Assist with or perform a vaginal examina-tion to determine cervical dilation, effacement, and engage-ment of the fetal presenting part. Evaluate for evidence ofmembrane rupture. Report any malodorous fluid. Nursing Management Nursing management of the woman with dystocia, regard-less of the etiology, requires patience. The nurse shouldprovide physical and emotional support to the client andher family. The nal outcome of any labor depends on thesize and shape of the maternal pelvis, the quality of theuterine contractions, and the size, presentation, and posi-tion of the fetus. Thus, dystocia is diagnosed not at thestart of labor but rather after it has progressed for a time. Promoting the Progress of Labor The nurse plays a major role in determining the progressof labor. Continue to assess the woman, frequently mon-itoring cervical dilation and effacement, uterine contrac-tions, and fetal descent, and document that all assessedparameters are progressing. Evaluate progress in activelabor by using the simple rule of 1 cm/hour for cervicaldilation. When the woman's membranes rupture, ifthey have not already ruptured, observe for visible cordprolapse.Throughout labor, assess the woman's fluid balance status. Check skin turgor and mucous membranes. Mon-itor intake and output. Also monitor the client's bladderfor distention at least every 2 hours and encourage her toempty her bladder often. In addition, monitor her bowelstatus. A full bladder or rectum can impede descent. Continue to monitor fetal well-being. If the fetus is in the breech position, be especially observant for visiblecord prolapse and note any variable decelerations in heartrate. If either occurs, report it immediately. Be prepared to administer a labor stimulant such as oxytocin (Pitocin) if ordered to treat hypotonic laborcontractions. Anticipate the need to assist with manipu-lations if shoulder dystocia is diagnosed. Prepare thewoman and her family for the possibility of a cesareanbirth if labor does not progress. Providing Physical and Emotional Comfort Employ physical comfort measures to promote relaxationand reduce stress. Offer blankets for warmth and a back-rub, if the client wishes, to reduce muscle tension. Pro-vide an environment conducive to rest so the woman canconserve her energy. Lower the lights and reduce exter-nal noise by closing the hallway door. Offer a warmshower to promote relaxation (if not contraindicated).Use pillows to support the woman in a comfortable posi-tion, changing her position every 30 minutes to reducetension and to enhance uterine activity and efciency.Offer her fluids/food as appropriate to moisten her mouthand replenish her energy (Fig. 21.2). Assist with providing counterpressure along with backrubs if the fetus is in the occiput posterior position.Encourage the woman to assume different positions topromote fetal rotation. Upright positions are helpful infacilitating fetal rotation and descent. Also encourage thewoman to visualize the descent and birth of the fetus. Assess the woman's level of pain and degree of dis- tress. Administer analgesics as ordered or according tothe facility's protocol. Evaluate the mother's level of fatigue throughout labor, such as verbal expressions of feeling exhausted, in-ability to cope in early labor, or inability to rest or calmdown between contractions. Praise the woman and herpartner for their efforts. Provide empathetic listening toincrease the client's coping ability, and remain with theclient to demonstrate caring. If a dysfunctional labor occurs, contrac- tions will slow or fail to advance in frequency, duration, or intensity; the cervix will fail to respond to uterine contractions by dilating and effacing; and the fetus will fail to descend.Take NOTE! 11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 621622 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Promoting Empowerment Educate the client and family about dysfunctional labor and its causes and therapies. Explain therapeutic inter-ventions that may be needed to assist with the laborprocess. Encourage the client and her partner to partici-pate in decision making about interventions. Assist the woman and partner in expressing their fears and anxieties. Provide encouragement to help themto maintain control. Support the client and her partner intheir coping efforts. Keep the woman and her partner in-formed of progress and advocate for them. Preterm Labor Preterm labor is dened as the occurrence of regular uterine contractions accompanied by cervical effacementand dilation before the end of the 37th week of gestation.If not halted, it leads to preterm birth. Preterm births remain one of the biggest contributors to perinatal morbidity and mortality in the world. Ac-cording to the March of Dimes (2007c, 2007d, 2007e),about 12% of births (one in eight infants) in the UnitedStates are premature. Preterm birth is one of the most common obstetric complications, and its sequelae have a profound effecton the survival and health of the newborn. The rate ofpreterm births in the United States has increased 35% inthe past 20 years. Preterm births account for 75% of neuro-developmental disorders and other serious morbidities,as well as behavioral and social problems. They account for 85% of all perinatal morbidity and mortality. In addi-tion, up to $30 billion is spent on maternal and infantcare related to prematurity (March of Dimes, 2007c). In-fants born prematurely also are at risk for serious seque-lae such as respiratory distress syndrome, infections,congenital heart defects, thermoregulation problems thatcan lead to acidosis and weight loss, intraventricularhemorrhage, feeding difculties resulting from dimin-ished stomach capacity and an underdeveloped suck re-flex, and neurologic disorders related to hypoxia andtrauma at birth (Gray, 2006). Although great strides havebeen made in neonatal intensive care, prematurity re-mains the leading cause of death within the rst month oflife and is the second leading cause of all infant deaths(March of Dimes, 2007c). The exact cause of preterm labor is not known. Cur- rently, prevention is the goal. Therapeutic Management Predicting the risk of preterm labor is valuable only if there is an available intervention that is likely to improvethe situation. According to ACOG, many factors must beconsidered before selecting an intervention. Many factorsinfluence the decision to intervene when women presentwith symptoms of preterm labor, including the probabil-ity of progressive labor, gestational age, and the risks oftreatment. ACOG (2003b) recommends the following asguidelines: There are no clear rst-line tocolytic drugs (drugs that promote uterine relaxation by interfering withuterine contractions) to manage preterm labor. Clini-cal circumstances and the health care provider's pref-erence should dictate treatment. Antibiotics do not appear to prolong gestation and should be reserved for group B streptococcal prophy-laxis in women in whom birth is imminent. Tocolytic drugs may prolong pregnancy for 2 to 7 days; during this time, steroids can be given to improve fetallung maturity and the woman can be transported to atertiary care center. Despite these recommendations, health care providers continue to prescribe pharmacologic treatment for pre-term labor at home and in the hospital setting. This treat-ment often includes oral or intravenous tocolytics andvarying degrees of activity restriction (Fig. 21.3). Anti-biotics may also be prescribed to treat presumed or con-rmed infections. Steroids may be given to enhance fetallung maturity between 24 weeks and 34 weeks' gestation. Tocolytic Therapy The decision to stop preterm labor is individualized based on risk factors, extent of cervical dilation, membrane sta-tus, fetal gestational age, and presence or absence of in-fection. Tocolytic therapy is most likely ordered if pretermFIGURE21.2 The nurse applies a cool, moist washcloth to the client's foreheadand offers her ice chips to combat thirstand provide comfort for the woman experiencing dystocia. 11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 622CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 623 labor occurs before the 34th week of gestation in an at- tempt to delay birth and thereby to reduce the severity ofrespiratory distress syndrome and other complications as-sociated with prematurity. Tocolytic therapy does nottypically prevent preterm birth, but it may delay it. It iscontraindicated for abruptio placentae, acute fetal distressor death, eclampsia or severe preeclampsia, active vaginalbleeding, dilation of more than 6 cm, chorioamnionitis,and maternal hemodynamic instability (Grifn, 2007). Medications most commonly used for tocolysis in- clude magnesium sulfate (which reduces These drugs are used \"off label\": this meansthey are effective for this purpose but have not been of-cially tested and developed for this purpose by the FDA(Tan et al., 2006). All these medications have serious sideeffects, and the woman needs close supervision when theyare being administered (Drug Guide 21.1). Corticosteroids Corticosteroids given to the mother in preterm labor canhelp prevent or reduce the frequency and severity ofrespiratory distress syndrome in premature infants de-livered between 24 weeks and 34 weeks' gestation. Thebenecial effects of corticosteroids on fetal lung matura-tion have been reported within 48 hours of initial admin-istration (Blackburn, 2007). These drugs require at least24 hours to become effective, so timely administration iscrucial. Nursing Assessment The preterm birth rate cannot be reduced until there areways to predict the risk for preterm birth. Because the eti-ology is often multifactorial, an individualized approach isneeded.Health History and Physical Examination The signs of preterm labor are subtle and may be over-looked by the client as well as the health care professional.Obtain a thorough health history and be alert for risk fac-tors associated with preterm labor and birth (Box 21.2). Frequently, women are unaware that uterine contrac- tions, effacement, and dilation are occurring, thus makingearly intervention ineffective in arresting preterm laborand preventing the birth of a premature newborn. Ask thewoman about any complaints, being alert for the subtlesymptoms of preterm labor, which may include: Change or increase in vaginal discharge Pelvic pressure (pushing-down sensation) Low, dull backache Menstrual-like cramps Heaviness or aching in the thighs Uterine contractions, with or without pain Intestinal cramping, with or without diarrhea (Gilbert, 2007; Gray, 2006) Assess the pattern of the contractions: the contrac- tions must be persistent, such that four contractions occurevery 20 minutes or eight contractions occur in 1 hour.Evaluate cervical dilation and effacement: cervical efface-ment is 80% or greater and cervical dilation is greater than1 cm (AAP & ACOG, 2003). On examination, engage-ment of the fetal presenting part will be noted. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Commonly used diagnostic testing for preterm labor riskassessment includes a complete blood count to detect in-fection, which may be a contributing factor to pretermlabor; urinalysis to detect bacteria and nitrites, which areindicative of a urinary tract infection; and an amniotic fluidanalysis to determine fetal lung maturity and the presenceof subclinical chorioamnionitis. Four other tests may be used for preterm labor pre- diction: fetal bronectin testing, cervical length evalua-tion by transvaginal ultrasound, salivary estriol, and homemonitoring of uterine activity to recognize preterm con-tractions. Fetal bronectin and cervical length examina-tions have a high negative predictive value and are thusbetter at predicting which pregnant women are unlikelyto have a preterm birth as opposed to predicting thosewho will (Grimes-Dennis & Berghella, 2007). Fetal Fibronectin Fetal bronectin, a glycoprotein produced by the chorion,is found at the junction of the chorion and decidua (fetalmembranes and uterus). It is present in cervicovaginalfluid prior to delivery, regardless of gestational age. It is notfound in vaginal secretions unless there has been a dis-ruption between the chorion and decidua. The test is a use-ful marker for impending membrane rupture within 7 to14 days if the level increases to greater than 0.05 ug/mL.Conversely, if fetal fibronectin is not present, there is aFIGURE21.3 The mother with preterm labor resting in bed at home. 11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 623624 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK DRUG GUIDE 21.1 MEDICATIONS USEDWITHPRETERM LABOR Drug Action/Indication Nursing Implications Magnesium sulfate Terbutaline sulfate (Brethine) Indomethacin (Indocin)Relaxes uterine muscles to stop irritability and contractions, to arrest uterine con-tractions for preterm labor (off-label use).

Monitor level of consciousness; report any headache, blurred vision, dizziness, or alteredlevel of consciousness. Perform continuous electronic fetal monitoring; report any decreased fetal heart rate variabil-ity, hypotonia, or respiratory depression. Monitor intake and output hourly; report any decrease in output (<30 mL/hour). Assess respiratory rate; report respiratory rate <12 breaths/minute; auscultate lung soundsfor evidence of pulmonary edema. Monitor for common maternal side effects, includ- ing flushing, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth,lethargy, blurred vision, and headache. Assess for nausea, vomiting, transient hypo- tension, lethargy. Assess for signs and symptoms of magnesium toxicity, such as decreased level of conscious-ness, depressed respirations and DTRs, slurredspeech, weakness, and respiratory and/or car-diac arrest. Have calcium gluconate readily available at the bedside to reverse magnesium toxicity. This drug is usually effective in delaying birth for up to 48 hours (Tan et al., 2006). Monitor the mother for adverse effects such as tachycardia, hypotension, palpitations, tremors,chest pain, hypokalemia, water retention, nau-sea, vomiting, de-creased urinary output, and nervousness. Monitor fetal well-being, noting any adverse effects such as tachycardia or heart failure. Adverse effects are dose-related and will increase as dose is increased. Perform cardiac assessment of woman to rule out preexisting cardiac disease and diabetes. Institute continuous fetal monitoring.Assess vital signs frequently for changes.Discontinue drug for maternalpulmonary edema. Have propranolol (Inderal) available to reverse cardiac adverse effects.

A sterile applicator is used to collect a cervicovaginal sample during a speculum examination. The result is either positive (fetal bronectin is present) or negative(fetal bronectin is not present). Interpretation of fetal -bronectin results must always be viewed in conjunctionwith the clinical ndings; it is not used as a lone indica-tor for predicting preterm labor. Transvaginal Ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound of the cervix has been used as atool to predict preterm labor in high-risk pregnanciesand to differentiate between true and false preterm labor.Three parameters are evaluated during the transvaginalultrasound: cervical length and width, funnel width andlength, and percentage of funneling. Measurement of theclosed portion of the cervix visualized during the trans-vaginal ultrasound is the single most reliable parameterfor prediction of preterm delivery in high-risk women (Blackburn, 2007). Cervical length varies during pregnancy and can be measured fairly reliably after 16 weeks' gestation using anultrasound probe inserted in the vagina. A cervical lengthof 3 cm or more indicates that delivery within 14 days isunlikely. Women with a short cervical length of 2.5 cmduring the mid-trimester have a substantially greater riskof preterm birth prior to 35 weeks' gestation. As with fetalbronectin testing, negative results can be reassuring andprevent unnecessary interventions (Grimes-Dennis &Berghella, 2007). Home Uterine Activity Monitoring Home monitoring of uterine activity can identify womenin preterm labor at an early stage to reduce the rate ofpreterm birth (Gilbert, 2007).

It involves clienteducation, daily client assessment, data collection, anddata interpretation (Gray, 2007). The woman is asked to wear an ambulatory tocodyna- mometer and transmit data to the nurse or health careprovider daily via telephone lines. Uterine and fetal activ-ity data are transmitted to perinatal nurses who are avail-able around the clock for detection of uterine contractions,in addition to picking up the fetal heart rate. Women are also asked to record uterine activity (uterine pressure,back pain, or cramps) they experience for an hour twicea day and then speak to a perinatal nurse, who analyzesthe results. If the number of contractions exceeds a predeter- mined threshold, the woman drinks 8 to 12 oz of water,rests, empties her bladder, and then repeats uterine mon-itoring. The effectiveness of this type of screening remainscontroversial (Morrison & Chauhan, 2003).Nursing Management Nurses play a key role in reducing preterm labor and births to improve pregnancy outcomes for both mothers andtheir infants. Early detection of preterm labor is currentlythe best strategy to improve outcomes. Because of the nu-merous factors associated with preterm labor, it is chal-lenging to identify and address all of them, especially whenwomen experiencing contractions are frequently falsely re-assured and not assessed thoroughly to determine thecause. This delay impedes initiation of interventions to re-duce infant death and morbidity. Preterm birth prevention programs for women at high risk have used self-monitoring of symptoms and patterns,weekly cervical examinations, telephone monitoring, homevisiting, and home uterine activity monitoring, alone or incombination, with mixed results (Gray, 2006). Nursing management of the woman with preterm labor involves administering tocolytic therapy if indicated,thoroughly educating the client, and providing psycholog-ical support during the process. Administering Tocolytic Therapy A rm diagnosis of preterm labor is necessary before treat- ment is considered. Diagnosis requires the presence ofboth uterine contractions and cervical change (or an ini-tial cervical examination of more than 2 cm and/or morethan 80% effacement in a nulliparous client). A cause forpreterm labor should always be sought. Absolute contra-indications to tocolytic agents include intrauterine infec-tion, fetal distress, vaginal bleeding, prolonged prematurerupture of the membranes, and intrauterine demise(Norwitz & Schorge, 2006). Bed rest and hydration arecommonly recommended, but without proven efcacy. Short-term pharmacologic therapy remains the cor- nerstone of management. However, there are no studiesto suggest that any tocolytic agent can delay birth forlonger than 48 hours (Stein, 2007). No single agent hasa clear therapeutic advantage. Magnesium sulfate may be ordered. This agent acts as a physiologic calcium antagonist and a general inhibitor ofneurotransmission. Expect to administer it intravenously.Monitor the woman for nausea, vomiting, headache, weak-ness, hypotension, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Assess thefetus for decreased fetal heart rate variability, drowsiness,and hypotonia. Magnesium has a wide margin of safety andis commonly used as a rst choice. Although calcium channel blockers may be pre- scribed to manage preterm labor, available literatureprovides little evidence that they have better efficacy intreating preterm labor than magnesium sulfate (ACOG,2003b). Administer calcium channel blockers (nifedip-ine) orally or sublingually every 4 to 8 hours as ordered.Monitor the woman for hypotension, reflex tachycardia,headache, nausea, and facial flushing. If beta-adrenergic agonists (terbutaline) are ordered, expect to administer the agent intravenously during theBOX 21.2 Risk Factors Associated With Preterm Labor and Birth African-American race (double the risk) Maternal age extremes less than 16 years and more than 40 years old Low socioeconomic status Alcohol or other drug use, especially cocaine Poor maternal nutrition Maternal periodontal disease Cigarette smoking Low level of education History of prior preterm birth (triples the risk) Uterine abnormalities, such as broids Low pregnancy weight for height Preexisting diabetes or hypertension Multiple gestation PROM Late or no prenatal care Short cervical length STIs: gonorrhea, Chlamydia, trichomoniasis Bacterial vaginosis (50% increased risk) Chorioamnionitis Hydramnios Gestational hypertension Cervical insufciency Short interpregnancy interval: less than 1 year between births Placental problems, such as placenta previa and abruption placenta Maternal anemia UTI Domestic violence Stress, acute and chronic (March of Dimes, 2007c)11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 626CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 627 initial period and then switch to the oral route for mainte- nance therapy. Closely assess the woman for side effects,including jitteriness, anxiety, restlessness, nausea, andtachycardia. Assess the fetus for tachycardia, hypotension,and hypoglycemia. Supportive nursing care is needed for the woman in preterm labor whether the contractions are stopped withtocolytic therapy or not. Nursing tasks include monitoringvital signs, measuring intake and output, encouraging bedrest on the woman's left side to enhance placental perfu-sion, monitoring the fetal heart rate via an external moni-tor continuously, limiting vaginal examinations to preventan ascending infection, and monitoring the mother andfetus closely for any adverse effects from the tocolyticagents. Offering the couple ongoing explanations will helpprepare them for the birth. Educating the Client Ensure that every pregnant woman receives basic educa-tion about preterm labor, including information aboutharmful lifestyles, the signs of genitourinary infections andpreterm labor, and the appropriate response to thesesymptoms. Teach the client how to palpate for and timeuterine contractions. Provide written materials to supportthis education at a level and in a language appropriate forthe client. Also educate clients about the importance ofprenatal care, risk reduction, and recognizing the signs andsymptoms of preterm labor. Teaching Guidelines 21.1highlights important instructions related to preventingpreterm labor. Explaining to the couple what is happening in terms of labor progress, the treatment regimen, and the status ofthe fetus is important to reduce the anxiety associated withthe risk of giving birth to a preterm infant. Educate themabout the importance of promotion of fetal lung maturitywith corticosteroids. Include supportive family membersin all education. Allow time for the woman and her familyto express their concerns about the possible outcome forthe infant and the possible side effects of the tocolytic ther-apy. Encourage them to vent any feelings, fears, and angerthey may experience. Provide the woman and her familywith an honest appraisal of the situation and plan of treat-ment throughout her care. Providing Psychological Support Preterm labor and birth present multifactorial challengesfor everyone involved. If the woman's activities are re-stricted, additional stresses may be placed on the family,contributing to the crisis. Assess the stress levels of theclient and family, and make appropriate referrals. Em-phasize the need for more frequent supervision and ofcevisits, and encourage clients to talk to their health careprovider for reassurance. Every case of spontaneous preterm labor is unique. Care must take into account the clinical circumstances,and the full and informed consent of the woman and herpartner is needed. Half of all women who ultimately give birth prematurely have no identiable risk factors. Nursesshould be sensitive to any complaint and should provideappropriate assessment, information, and follow-up. Sen-sitivity to the subtle differences between normal preg-nancy sensations and the prodromal symptoms of pretermlabor is a key factor in ensuring timely care. Offer clari-cation and validation of the woman's symptoms.TEACHING GUIDELINES 21.1 Teaching to Prevent Preterm Labor Avoid traveling for long distances in cars, trains, planes, or buses. Avoid lifting heavy objects, such as laundry, gro-ceries, or a young child. Avoid performing hard, physical work, such as yardwork, moving of furniture, or construction. Visit a dentist in early pregnancy to evaluate andtreat periodontal disease. Enroll in a smoking cessation program if you areunable to quit on your own. Curtail sexual activity until after 37 weeks if experi-encing preterm labor symptoms. Consume a well-balanced nutritional diet to gainappropriate weight. Avoid the use of substances such as marijuana, co-caine, and heroin. Identify factors and areas of stress in your life, anduse stress management techniques to reduce them. If you are experiencing intimate partner violence,seek resources to modify the situation. Recognize the signs and symptoms of preterm laborand notify your birth attendant if any occur: Uterine contractions, cramping, or low back pain Feeling of pelvic pressure or fullness Increase in vaginal discharge Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Leaking of fluid from vagina If you are experiencing any of these signs or symp- toms, do the following: Stop what you are doing and rest for 1 hour. Empty your bladder. Lie down on your side. Drink two to three glasses of water. Feel your abdomen and make note of the hard-ness of the contraction. Call your health careprovider and describe the contraction as Mild if it feels like the tip of the nose Moderate if it feels like the tip of the chin Strong if it feels like your forehead (Simhan &Caritis, 2007) 11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 627628 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK If tocolytic therapy isn't successful in stopping uterine contractions, support the couple through this stressful pe-riod to prepare them for the birth. Keep them informed ofall progress and changes; for example, continuously mon-itor maternal and fetal vital signs, especially the maternaltemperature to detect signs of early infection. Offer one-on-one contact and be available throughout this difcultand anxiety-producing period. Postterm Labor A term pregnancy usually lasts 38 to 42 weeks. A post- term pregnancy is one that continues past the end of the 42nd week of gestation, or 294 days from the rst day ofthe last menstrual period. Postterm pregnancies accountfor about 3% to 12% of births (Butler & Wilkes, 2007). In-correct dates account for the majority of these cases: manywomen have irregular menses and thus cannot identify thedate of their last menstrual period accurately. Recall Jennifer described at the beginning of the chapter, who was at 41 weeks' gestation. What information would bemost important to determine on admission to the facility?What interventions might the nurse anticipate when shearrives? The exact etiology of a postterm pregnancy is un- known because the mechanism for the initiation of laboris not completely understood. Theories suggest there maybe a deciency of estrogen and continued secretion ofprogesterone that prohibits the uterus from contracting,but no evidence has validated this. A woman who has onepostterm pregnancy is at greater risk for another in sub-sequent pregnancies. Postterm pregnancies may adversely affect both the mother and fetus or newborn. Maternal risk is related tothe large size of the fetus at birth, which increases thechances that a cesarean birth will be needed. Other issuesmight include dystocia, birth trauma, postpartum hemor-rhage, and infection. Mechanical or articial interventionssuch as forceps or vacuum-assisted birth and labor induc-tion with oxytocin may be necessary. In addition, mater-nal exhaustion and feelings of despair over this prolongedgestation can add to the woman's anxiety level and reduceher coping ability. Fetal risks associated with a postterm pregnancy clude macrosomia, shoulder disproportion. All of these con-ditions predispose this fetus to birth trauma or a surgicalbirth. The perinatal mortality rate at more than 42 weeksof gestation is twice that at term and increases six-fold andhigher at 43 weeks of gestation and beyond. Uteroplacen-tal insufciency, meconium aspiration, and intrauterineinfection contribute to the increased rate of perinataldeaths (Heimstad et al., 2006). As the placenta ages, itsperfusion decreases and it becomes less efcient at deliv- ering oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Amniotic fluidvolume also begins to decline by 40 weeks of gestation,possibly leading to oligohydramnios, subsequently result-ing in fetal hypoxia and an increased risk of cord compres-sion because the cushioning effect offered by adequatefluid is no longer present. Hypoxia and oligohydramniospredispose the fetus to aspiration of meconium, whichis released by the fetus in response to a hypoxic insult(G\u00fcmezoglu, Crowther, & Middleton, 2006). All of theseissues can compromise fetal well-being and lead to fetaldistress. Nursing Assessment Obtain a thorough history to determine the estimated dateof birth. Many women are unsure of the date of their lastmenstrual period, so the date given may be unreliable. De-spite numerous methods used to date pregnancies, manyare still misdated. Accurate gestational dating via ultra-sound is essential. Antepartum assessment for a postterm pregnancy typ- ically includes daily fetal movement counts done by thewoman, nonstress tests done twice weekly, amniotic fluidassessments as part of the biophysical prole, and weeklycervical to evaluate for ripening. In addition,assess the following: Client's understanding of the various fetal well-being tests Client's stress and anxiety concerning her lateness Client's coping ability and support network Nursing Management Once the dates are established and postdate status isconrmed, monitoring fetal well-being becomes critical.When determining the plan of care for a woman with apostterm pregnancy, the rst decision is whether to de-liver the baby or wait. If the decision is to wait, then fetalsurveillance is key. If the decision is to have the womandeliver, labor induction is initiated. Both decisions remaincontroversial, and there is no clear answer about whichoption is more appropriate. Therefore, the plan must beindividualized. Think back to Jennifer, who is scheduled for labor induction. What ongoing nursing assessments would beimportant when providing care for her? Providing Support The intense surveillance is time-consuming and intrusive,adding to the anxiety and worry already being experiencedby the woman about her overdue status. Be alert to thewoman's anxiety and allow her to discuss her feelings. Pro-vide reassurance about the expected time range for birth11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 628CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 629 and the well-being of the fetus based on the assessment tests. Validating the woman's stressful state due to the pro-longed pregnancy provides an opportunity for her to ver-balize her feelings openly. Educating the Woman and Her Partner Teach the woman and her partner about the testing re-quired and the reasons for each test. Also describe themethods that may be used for cervical ripening if indi-cated. Explain about the possibility of induction if thewoman's labor isn't spontaneous or if a dysfunctional laborpattern occurs. Also prepare the woman for the possibilityof a surgical delivery if fetal distress occurs. Providing Care During the Intrapartum Period During the intrapartum period, continuously assess andmonitor fetal heart rate (FHR) to identify potential fetaldistress early (e.g., late or variable decelerations) so thatinterventions can be initiated. Also monitor the woman'shydration status to ensure maximal placental perfusion.When the membranes rupture, assess amniotic fluid char-acteristics (color, amount, and odor) to identify previousfetal hypoxia and prepare for prevention of meconium as-piration. Report meconium-stained amniotic fluid imme-diately when the membranes rupture. Anticipate the need for amnioinfusion to minimize the risk of meconium aspi-ration by diluting the meconium in the amniotic fluidexpelled by the hypoxic fetus. In addition, monitor thewoman's labor pattern closely because dysfunctional pat-terns are common (Gilbert, 2007). Encourage the woman to verbalize her feelings and concerns, and answer all her questions. Provide support,presence, information, and encouragement throughoutthis time. Women Requiring Labor Induction and Augmentation Ideally, all pregnancies go to term, with labor beginning spontaneously. However, many women need help to ini-tiate or sustain the labor process. Labor induction in- volves the stimulation of uterine contractions by medicalor surgical means to produce delivery before the onset ofspontaneous labor. The labor induction rate is at an all-time high in the United States. The widespread use of ar-ticial induction of labor for convenience has contributedto the recent increase in the number of cesarean births.G\u00fclmezoglu, A. M., Crowther, C. A., & Middleton, P. (2006). Induction of labour for improving birth outcomes for women at or beyond term. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006. Issue 4. Art. No.: CD004945.DOI:10.1002/14651858.CD004945.pub2.Study Postterm pregnancies may adversely affect both the mother and fetus or newborn. Placental perfusion decreases as theplacenta ages and becomes less efcient at delivering oxy-gen and nutrients to the fetus. Amniotic fluid volume alsobegins to decline by 40 weeks of gestation, increasing thefetus's risk for oligohydramnios, meconium aspiration, andcord compression. However, questions arise: What is thebest time for inducing labor in a postterm pregnancy? Doeslabor induction improve maternal and fetal outcomes, orwould it be better to wait for spontaneous labor to begin? A study was conducted to compare the effects of inducinglabor in women at or beyond term with those of waiting forspontaneous labor to begin. A search was conducted forrandomized controlled trials that compared labor inductionwith waiting for spontaneous labor to begin in women whowere at term or postterm. Two review authors collectedthe data and analyzed the trials. A total of 19 trials involving almost 8,000 women were evaluated. Findings Based on the trials analyzed, fewer perinatal deaths occurred in women who underwent labor induction at 41 completed weeks of gestation or later. Fewer newborns experienced meconium aspiration syndrome with inductionat 41 weeks or more. Women at 37 to 40 weeks' gestationwho received expectant management were more likely toundergo a cesarean birth compared to those in the samegestational week range who received induction. Statisticalanalysis, however, showed that these differences were notsignicant. Nursing Implications Although the study did not reveal results that were statisti- cally signicant, nurses need to be aware of the potentialbenets and limitations associated with labor induction sothat they can provide women and their families with themost appropriate information about options for a posttermpregnancy. Nurses can integrate information from this studyin their teaching about the risks associated with posttermpregnancy. They can also use this information to help an-swer the couple's questions about induction and its effec-tiveness as well as provide anticipatory guidance aboutthe procedure. Doing so fosters empowerment of thewoman and her family, promoting optimal informed deci-sion making. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 21.1 Labor Induction and Outcomes for Women Beyond Term11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 629630 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Evidence is compelling that elective induction of labor signicantly increases the risk of cesarean birth, instru-mented delivery, use of epidural analgesia, and neonatalintensive care unit admission, especially for nulliparouswomen (Crane, 2006). Labor induction is not an isolated event: it brings about a cascade of other interventions that may or may notproduce a favorable outcome. Labor induction also in-volves intravenous therapy, bed rest, continuous electronicfetal discomfort from stimulatinguterine contractions, epidural analgesia/anesthesia, and aprolonged stay on the labor unit (Wing, 2006). Labor augmentation enhances ineffective contrac- tions after labor has begun. Continuous electronic FHRmonitoring is necessary. There are multiple medical and obstetric reasons for inducing labor, the most common being postterm gesta-tion. Other indications for inductions include prolongedpremature hyper-tension, dystocia, fetal demise, and diabetes(Bueno et previa, fetal lie, prolapsed umbilical cord, a priorclassic uterine incision that entered the uterine cavity,pelvic structure abnormality, previous myomectomy,vaginal bleeding with unknown cause, invasive cervicalcancer, active genital herpes infection, and abnormalFHR patterns (ACOG, 2004b). In general, labor induc-tion is indicated when the benets of birth outweigh therisks to the mother or fetus for continuing the pregnancy.However, the balance between risk and benet remainscontroversial.Therapeutic Management The decision to induce labor is based on a thorough eval- uation of maternal and fetal status. Typically, this in-cludes an ultrasound to evaluate fetal size, position, andgestational age and to locate the placenta; pelvimetry torule (PG) level fetal Nitrazine testto conrm membranes; complete blood countand urinalysis to rule out infection; and a vaginal exami-nation to evaluate the cervix for inducibility (ACOG,2004). Accurate dating of the pregnancy also is essentialbefore cervical ripening and induction are initiated toprevent a preterm birth. Cervical Ripening There has been increasing awareness that if the cervix isunfavorable or unripe, a successful vaginal birth is un-likely. Cervical ripeness is an important variable whenlabor induction is being considered. A ripe cervix is short-ened, centered (anterior), softened, and partially dilated.An unripe cervix is long, closed, posterior, and rm. Cer-vical ripening usually begins prior to the onset of laborcontractions and is necessary for cervical dilatation andthe passage of the fetus. Various scoring systems to assess cervical ripeness have been introduced, but the Bishop score is most com-monly used today. The Bishop score helps identifywomen who would be most likely to achieve a successfulinduction (Table 21.2). The duration of labor is inverselycorrelated with the Bishop score: a score over 8 indicatesa successful vaginal birth. Bishop scores of less than 6usually indicate that a cervical ripening method should beused prior to induction (Rai & Schreiber, 2007). Nonpharmacologic Methods Nonpharmacologic methods for cervical ripening are lessfrequently used today, but nurses need to be aware ofthem and question clients about their use. Methods mayinclude herbal agents such as evening primrose oil, blackhaw, black and blue cohosh, and red raspberry leaves. In Before labor induction is started, fetal maturity (dating, ultrasound, amniotic fluid studies) and cervical readiness (vaginal exami-nation, Bishop scoring) must be assessed. Both need tobe favorable for a successful induction.Take NOTE! 0 Closed 0-30% -3 Firm Posterior 1 -2 Medium Midposition 2 3-4 cm 60-70% or Soft Anterior 5-6 cm 80% +1 or +2 Very soft AnteriorEffacement Cervical Position of Score Dilation (cm) (%) Station Consistency CervixTABLE 21.2 BISHOPSCORING SYSTEM Modied from Bishop, E.

The risks and ben-ets of these agents are unknown. Another nonpharmacologic method suggested for labor induction is sexual intercourse along with breaststimulation. This promotes the release of oxytocin, whichstimulates uterine contractions. In addition, human semenis a biological source of prostaglandins used for cervicalripening. According to a Cochrane Review, sexual inter-course with breast stimulation would appear benecial,but safety issues have not been fully evaluated, nor can thisactivity be standardized (Kavanagh, Kelly, & Thomas,2007). Therefore, its use as a method for labor inductionis not validated by research. Mechanical Methods Mechanical methods are used to open the cervix andstimulate the progression of labor. All share a similarmechanism of action\u2014application of local pressure stim-ulates the release of prostaglandins to ripen the cervix.Potential advantages of mechanical methods, comparedwith pharmacologic methods, may include simplicity orpreservation of the cervical tissue or structure, lower cost,and fewer side effects. The risks associated with thesemethods include infection, bleeding, membrane rupture,and placental disruption (Boulvain et al., 2007). For example, an indwelling (Foley) catheter (e.g., 26 French) can be inserted into the endocervical canal toripen and dilate the cervix. The catheter is placed in theuterus, and the balloon is lled. Direct pressure is thenapplied to the lower segment of the uterus and the cervix.This direct pressure causes stress in the lower uterine seg-ment and probably the local production of prostaglandins(Rai & Schreiber, 2007). Hygroscopic dilators absorb endocervical and local tissue fluids; as they enlarge, they expand the endocervixand provide controlled mechanical pressure. The prod-ucts available include natural osmotic dilators (laminaria,a type of sulfate (Lamicel, Dilapan). Hygroscopicdilators are advantageous because they can be inserted onan outpatient basis and no fetal monitoring is needed. Asmany dilators are inserted in the cervix as will t, andthey expand over 12 to 24 hours as they absorb water.Absorption of water leads to expansion of the dilators andopening of the cervix. They are a reliable alternativewhen prostaglandins are contraindicated or unavailable(Gelber, 2006). Surgical Methods Surgical methods used to ripen the cervix and inducelabor include stripping of the membranes and perform-ing an amniotomy. Stripping of the membranes is accom-plished by inserting a nger through the internal cervicalos and moving it in a circular direction. This motioncauses the membranes to detach. Manual separation of the amniotic membranes from the cervix is thought toinduce cervical ripening and the onset of labor (Rai &Schreiber, 2007). An amniotomy involves inserting a cervical hook (Amniohook) through the cervical os to deliberately rup-ture the membranes. This promotes pressure of the pre-senting part on the cervix and stimulates an increase inthe activity of prostaglandins locally. Risks associatedwith these procedures include umbilical cord prolapseor compression, maternal or neonatal infection, FHRdecel eration, bleeding, and client discomfort (Shobeiri, Tehranian, & Nazari, 2007). When either of these techniques is used, amniotic fluid characteristics (such as whether it is clear or bloody,or meconium is present) and the FHR pattern must bemonitored closely. Pharmacologic Agents The use of pharmacologic agents has revolutionized cer-vical ripening. The use of prostaglandins to attain cervi-cal ripening has been found to be highly effective inproducing cervical changes independent of uterine con-tractions (Sifakis et al., 2007). In some cases, women willgo into labor, requiring no additional stimulants for in-duction. Induction of labor with prostaglandins offers theadvantage of promoting both cervical ripening and uter-ine contractility. A drawback of prostaglandins is theirability to induce excessive uterine contractions, whichcan increase maternal and perinatal morbidity (Hofmeyr& Gulmezoglu, 2007). agent used in the treatmentand prevention of peptic ulcers. It can be administeredintravaginally or orally to ripen the cervix or induce labor.It is available in 100-mcg or 200-mcg tablets, but dosesof 25 to 50 mcg are typically used. However, it is not ap-proved by the FDA for cervical ripening since several re-ports found higher levels of uterine rupture associatedwith its use (USFDA, 2007) (Drug Guide 21.2). Fur-thermore, it is contraindicated for women with prior uter-ine scars and therefore should not be used for cervicalripening in women attempting a VBAC. Oxytocin induction and naturally by the posterior pituitary gland andstimulates contractions of the uterus. For women withlow Bishop scores, cervical ripening is typically initiatedbefore oxytocin is used. Once the cervix is ripe, oxytocinis the most popular pharmacologic agent used for induc-ing or augmenting labor. Frequently a woman with anunfavorable cervix is admitted the evening before induc-11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 631632 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK tion to ripen her cervix with one of the prostaglandin agents. Then induction begins with oxytocin the nextmorning if she has not already gone into labor. Doing somarkedly enhances the success of induction. Response to oxytocin varies widely: some women are very sensitive to even small amounts. The most commonadverse effect of oxytocin is uterine hyperstimulation, lead-ing to fetal compromise and impaired oxygenation (Smith& Merrill, 2006). The response of the uterus to the drug isclosely monitored throughout labor so that the oxytocininfusion can be titrated appropriately. In addition, oxy-tocin has an antidiuretic effect, resulting in decreased urineflow that may lead to water intoxication. Symptoms towatch for include headache and vomiting. Oxytocin is administered via an intravenous infusion pump piggybacked into the main intravenous line at theport most proximal to the insertion site. Usually 10 units of oxytocin is added to 1 L of isotonic solution to achieve aninfusion rate of 1 mU/min =6 mL/hr. The dose is titrated according to protocol to achieve stable contractions every2 to 3 minutes lasting 40 to 60 seconds (Briggs & Wan,2006). The uterus should relax between contractions. If theresting uterine tone remains above 20 mmHg, uteroplacen-tal insufciency and fetal hypoxia can result. This under-scores the importance of continuous FHR monitoring. Oxytocin has many advantages: it is potent and easy to titrate, it has a short half-life (1 to 5 minutes), and it isgenerally well tolerated. Induction using oxytocin hasside effects (water intoxication, hypotension, and uterinehypertonicity), but because the drug does not cross theplacental barrier, no direct fetal problems have been ob-served (Khan, Khan, & Ashraf, 2007) (Fig. 21.4).

After her cervix is ripened, anoxytocin infusion is started and her progress is slow. Whatencouragement can the nurse offer? After a few hours, hercontractions begin to increase in intensity and frequency.What typical pain management measures can the nurseimplement, and how would the nurse evaluate theeffectiveness of these measures? Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the woman who is undergoing laborinduction or augmentation involves a thorough historyand physical examination. Review the woman's history forrelative indications for induction or augmentation, suchas diabetes, postterm status, dysfunctionallabor pattern, prolonged ruptured membranes, and mater-nal or fetal infection, and for contraindications such as pla-centa previa, overdistended uterus, active genital herpes,fetopelvic disproportion, fetal malposition, or severe fetaldistress. Assist with determining the gestational age of the fetus to prevent a preterm birth. Assess fetal well-being to vali-date the client's and fetus's ability to withstand labor con-tractions. Evaluate the woman's cervical status, includingcervical dilatation and effacement, and station via vaginalexamination as appropriate before cervical ripening or in-duction is started. Determine the Bishop score to deter-mine the probable success of induction.TEACHING GUIDELINES 21.2 Teaching in Preparation for Labor Induction Your health care provider may recommend that you have your labor induced. This may be necessary fora variety of reasons, such as elevated blood pres-sure, a medical condition, prolonged pregnancyover 41 weeks, or problems with fetal heart ratepatterns or fetal growth. Your health care provider may use one or moremethods to induce labor, such as stripping themembranes, breaking the amniotic sac to release thefluid, administering medication close to or in thecervix to soften it, or administering a medicationcalled oxytocin (Pitocin) to stimulate contractions. Labor induction is associated with some risks anddisadvantages, such as overactivity of the uterus;nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; and changes in fetalheart rate. Prior to inducing your labor, your health careprovider may perform a procedure to ripen yourcervix to help ensure a successful induction. Medication may be placed around cervix the daybefore you are scheduled to be induced. During the induction, your contractions may feelstronger than normal. However, the length of yourlabor may be reduced with induction. Medications for pain relief and comfort measureswill be readily available. Health care staff will be present throughout labor. FIGURE21.4 The nurse monitors an intra- venous infusion of oxytocin being ad-ministered to a woman in labor. Nurses working with women in labor play an important role acting as the \"eyes\" and \"ears\" for the birth attendant because they remain atthe client's bedside throughout the entire experience.Close, frequent assessment and follow-up interventionsare essential to ensure the safety of the mother andher unborn child during cervical ripening and labor induction or augmentation.Take NOTE! Nursing Management Explain to the woman and her partner about the induc-tion or augmentation procedure clearly, using simpleterms (Teaching Guidelines 21.2). Ensure that an in-formed consent has been signed after the client and her11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 633634 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK partner have received complete information about the procedure, including its advantages, disadvantages, andpotential risks. Ensure that the Bishop score has beendetermined before proceeding. Nursing Care Plan 21.1presents an overview of the nursing care for a womanundergoing labor induction. Administering Oxytocin If not already done, prepare the oxytocin infusion by dilut- ing 10 units of oxytocin in 1,000 mL of lactated Ringer'ssolution. Use an infusion pump on a secondary line con-nected to the primary infusion. Start the oxytocin infusionin mU/min or milliliters per hour as ordered. Typically, theinitial dose is 0.5 to 1 mU/min; anticipate increasing therate in increments of 1 to 2 mU/min every 30 to 60 min-utes. Maintain the rate once the desired contraction fre-quency has been reached. To ensure adequate maternaland fetal surveillance during induction or augmentation,the nurse-to-client ratio should not exceed 1:2 (Briggs &Wan, 2006). During induction or augmentation, monitoring of the maternal and fetal status is essential. Apply an externalelectronic fetal monitor or assist with placement of an in-ternal device. Obtain the mother's vital signs and the FHRevery 15 minutes during the rst stage. Evaluate the con-tractions (frequency, duration, and intensity) and restingtone, and adjust the oxytocin infusion rate accordingly.Monitor the FHR, including baseline rate, baseline vari-ability, and decelerations, to determine whether the oxy-tocin rate needs adjustment. Discontinue the oxytocinand notify the birth attendant if uterine hyperstimulationor a nonreassuring FHR pattern occurs. Perform or assistwith periodic vaginal examinations to determine cervicaldilation and fetal descent: cervical dilation of 1 cm/hourtypically indicates satisfactory progress. Continue to monitor the FHR continuously and doc- ument it every 15 minutes during the active phase of laborand every 5 minutes during the second stage. Assist withpushing efforts during the second stage. Measure and record intake and output to prevent ex- cess fluid volume. Encourage the client to empty her blad-der every 2 hours to prevent soft tissue obstruction. Providing Pain Relief and Support Assess the woman's level of pain. Ask her frequently to rate her pain and provide pain management as needed.Offer position changes and other non-pharmacologicmeasures. Note her reaction to any medication given, anddocument its effect. Monitor her need for comfort meas-ures as contractions increase. Throughout induction and augmentation, frequently reassure the woman and her partner about the fetal sta-tus and labor progress. Provide them with frequent up-dates on the condition of the woman and the fetus. Assessthe woman's ability to cope with stronger contractions(Kuczkowski, 2007). Provide support and encourage-ment as indicated.A fter a very long day, Jennifer gives birth to a healthy baby boy with Apgar scores of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. When transferring her to the postpartum unit,what information is essential to include for the accepting nurse?What specic nursing information should be given to thenursery nurse regarding the laboring experience? With such alengthy labor, what assessments might the postpartum nursebe especially focused on for the rst few hours after birth? Intrauterine Fetal Demise When an unborn life suddenly ends with fetal loss, the family members are profoundly affected. The sudden lossof an expected child is tragic and the family's grief can bevery intense: it can last for years and can cause extremepsychological stress and emotional problems (Lindsey &Azad, 2007). Fetal death can be due to numerous conditions, such as prolonged pregnancy, infection, hypertension, ad vanced maternal age, Rh disease, uterine rupture, diabetes, con-genital anomalies, cord accident, abruption, prematurerupture of membranes, or hemorrhage; it may go un-explained (Gilbert, 2007). Early pregnancy loss may bethrough a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), an inducedabortion (therapeutic abortion), or a ruptured ectopicpregnancy. A wide spectrum of feelings may be ex- pressed, from relief to sadness and despair. A stillbirthcan occur at any gestational age, and typically there islittle or no warning other than reduced fetal movement. The period following a fetal death is extremely dif- cult for the family. For many women, emotional healingtakes much longer than physical healing. The feelings ofloss can be intense. The grief response in some womenmay be so great that their relationships become strained,and healing can become hampered unless appropriateinterventions and support are provided. Fetal death also affects the health care staff. Despite the trauma that the loss of a fetus causes, some staff mem-bers avoid dealing with the bereaved family, never talkingabout or acknowledging their grief. This seems to implythat not discussing the problem will allow the grief to dis-solve and vanish. As a result, the family's needs go unrec-ognized. Failing to keep the lines of communication openwith a bereaved client and her family closes off some ofthe channels to recovery and healing that may be desper-ately needed. Subsequently, the bereaved family membersmay feel isolated. Nursing Assessment History and physical examination are of limited value inthe diagnosis of fetal death, since the only history tends to be recent absence of fetal movement. An inability toobtain fetal heart sounds on examination suggests fetaldemise, but an ultrasound is necessary to conrm the absence of fetal cardiac activity. Once fetal demise is con-rmed, induction of labor is indicated.11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 634635 Nursing Care Plan 21.1 OVERVIEW OF THE WOMAN UNDERGOING LABORINDUCTION Rose, a 29-year-old primipara, is admitted to the labor and birth suite at 40 weeks' gestation for induction of labor. Assessment reveals that her cervix is ripe and 80% effaced, and dilated to 2 cm. Rose says, \"I'm a bit nervous about beinginduced. I've never been through labor before and I'm afraid that I'll have a lot of pain from the medicine used to start thecontractions.\" She consents to being induced but wants reassurance that this procedure won't harm the baby. Upon exam-ination, the fetus is engaged and in a cephalic presentation, with the vertex as the presenting part. Her partner is at herside. Induction is initiated with oxytocin. Rose reports that contractions have started and are beginning to get stronger. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to induction of labor and lack of experience with labor as evidenced by statements about being nervous, not having gone through labor before and fear of pain Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will experience decrease in anxiety as evidenced by ability to verbalize understanding of procedures involved anduse of positive coping skills to reduce anxious state. Interventions: Minimizing Anxiety Provide a clear explanation of the labor induction process to provide client and partner with a knowledge base. Maintain continuous physical presence to provide physical and emotional support and demonstrate concern for maternal and fetal well-being. Explain each procedure before carrying it out and answer questions to promote understanding of procedure and rationale for use and decrease fears of the unknown. Review with client measures used in the past to deal with stressful situations to determine effectiveness; encourage use of past effective coping strategies to aid in controlling anxiety. Instruct client's partner in helpful measures to assist client in coping and encourage their use to foster joint participation in the process and feelings of being in control and to provide support to the client. Offer frequent reassurance of fetal status and labor progress to help alleviate client's concerns and foster continued partic- ipation in the labor process. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury (maternal or fetal) related to induction procedure as evidenced by client's concerns about fetal well-being and possible adverse effects of oxytocin administration Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will remain free of complications associated with induction as evidenced by progression of labor as expected, delivery of healthy newborn, and absence of signs and symptoms of maternal and fetal adverse effects. Interventions: Promoting Maternal and Fetal Safety Follow agency's protocol for medication use and infusion rate to ensure accurate, safe drug administration. Set up oxytocin IV infusion to piggyback into the primary IV infusion line to allow for prompt discontinuation should adverse effects occur. Use an infusion pump to deliver accurate dose as ordered. Gradually increase oxytocin dose in increments of 1 to 2 mU/min every 30 to 60 minutes based on assessment ndings and protocol to promote effective uterine contractions. Maintain oxytocin rate once desired frequency of contractions has been reached to ensure continued progress in labor. Accurately monitor contractions for frequency, duration, and intensity and resting tone to prevent development of hyper- tonic contractions. Maintain a nurse-client ratio of 1:2 to ensure maternal and fetal safety. Monitor FHR via electronic fetal monitoring during induction and continuously observe the FHR response to titrated medication rate to ensure fetal well-being and identify adverse effects immediately. Obtain maternal vital signs every 1 to 2 hours or as indicated by agency's protocol, reporting any deviations, to promote maternal well-being and allow for prompt detection of problems. Communicate with birth attendant frequently concerning progress to ensure continuity of care. (continued)11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 635636 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Nursing Management The nurse can play a major role in assisting the grieving family. With skillful intervention, the bereaved family maybe better prepared to resolve their grief and move forward.To assist families in the grieving process, include the fol-lowing measures: Provide accurate, understandable information to the family. Encourage discussion of the loss and venting of feel- ings of grief and guilt. Provide the family with baby mementos and pictures to validate the reality of death. Allow unlimited time with the stillborn infant after birth to validate the death; provide time for the familymembers to be together and grieve; offer the familythe opportunity to see, touch, and hold the infant. Use appropriate touch, such as holding a hand or touching a shoulder. Inform the chaplain or the religious leader of the fam- ily's denomination about the death and request his orher presence. Assist the parents with the funeral arrangements or disposition of the body. Provide the parents with brochures offering advice about how to talk to other siblings about the loss. Refer the family to the support group SHARE Pregnancy and Infant Loss Support, Inc., which is designed for thosewho have lost an infant through abortion, miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or other tragic circumstances. Make community referrals to promote a continuum of care after discharge. Women Experiencing an Obstetric Emergency Obstetric emergencies are challenging to all labor and birth personnel because of the increased risk of adverseoutcomes for the mother and fetus. Quick clinical judg-ment and good critical decision making will increase theodds of a positive outcome for both mother and fetus.This chapter will discuss a few of these emergencies: um-bilical prolapse, placental PROLAPSE An umbilical cord prolapse is the protrusion of the umbilical cord alongside (occult) or ahead of the present-ing part of the fetus (Fig. 21.5). This condition occurs in1 out of every 300 births and requires prompt recogni-tion and intervention for a positive outcome (March of Dimes, 2007f). Cord prolapse occurs in 3% of deliverieswhen the fetus is in the vertex position and in 3.7% of de-liveries when the fetus is in the breech position. The riskis increased further when the presenting part does not llthe lower uterine segment, as is the case with incompleteDiscontinue oxytocin infusion if tetanic contractions (>90 seconds), uterine hyperstimulation (<2 minutes apart), elevated uterine resting tone, or a nonreassuring FHR pattern occurs to minimize risk of drug's adverse effects. Provide client with frequent reassurance of maternal and fetal status to minimize anxiety. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Pain related to uterine contractions as evidenced by client's statements about contractions increasing in intensity and expected effect of oxytocin administration Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client will report a decrease in pain as evidenced by statements of increased comfort and pain rating of 3 or less on numericpain rating scale. Interventions: Promoting Comfort and Pain Relief Explain to the client that she will experience discomfort sooner than with naturally occurring labor to promote client's awareness of events and prepare client for the experience. Frequently assess client's pain using a pain rating scale to quantify client's level of pain and evaluate effectiveness of pain-relief measures. Provide comfort measures, such as hygiene, backrubs, music, and distraction, and encourage the use of breathing and relax-ation techniques to help promote relaxation. Provide support for her partner to aid in alleviating stress and concerns. Employ nonpharmacologic methods, such as position changes, birthing ball, hydrotherapy, visual imagery, and effleurage, to help in managing pain and foster feelings of control over situation. Administer pharmacologic agents such as analgesia or anesthesia as appropriate and as ordered to control pain. Continuously reassess client's pain level to evaluate effectiveness of pain management techniques used.Nursing Care Plan 21.1 (continued)11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 636CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 637 part is well applied to the cervix and engaged into the pelvis. If pressure or compression of the cord occurs,assist with measures to relieve the compression. Typi-cally, the examiner places a sterile gloved hand into thevagina and holds the presenting part off the umbilicalcord until delivery. Changing the woman's position toa modified Sims, Trendelenburg, or knee-chest posi-tion also helps relieve cord pressure. Monitor fetalheart rate, maintain bedrest, and administer oxygen ifordered. Provide emotional support and explanationsas to what is going on to allay the woman's fears andanxiety. If the mother's cervix is not fully dilated, pre-pare the woman for an emergency cesarean birth tosave the fetus's life. PLACENTAL ABRUPTION Placental abruption refers to premature separation of a normally implanted placenta from the maternal my-ometrium. Abruptio placentae occurs in about 1% of allpregnancies throughout the world (March of Dimes,2007a). Risk factors include preeclampsia, gestationalhypertension, seizure activity, uterine rupture, trauma,smoking, cocaine use, coagulation defects, previous his-tory of abruption, domestic violence, and placentalpathology. These conditions may force blood into the un-derlayer of the placenta and cause it to detach (Deering& Satin, 2007). Management of placental abruption depends on the gestational age, the extent of the hemorrhage, andmater nal-fetal oxygenation perfusion/reserve status (see Chapter 19 for additional information on abruptio placen-tae). Treatment is based on the circumstances. Typicallyonce the diagnosis is established, the focus is on maintain-ing the cardiovascular status of the mother and developinga plan to deliver the fetus quickly. A cesarean birth takesplace if the fetus is still alive. A vaginal birth may take placeif there is fetal demise.FIGURE 21.5 Prolapsed cord. (A) Prolapse within the uterus. (B) Prolapse with the cord visible at the vulva. A B When the presenting part does not fully occupy the pelvic inlet, prolapse is more likely to occur.Take NOTE! breech presentations (5% to 10%), premature infants, and multiparous women (Morgan & Ross, 2007). With a50% perinatal mortality rate, it is one of the most cata-strophic events in the intrapartum period (Enakpene,Omigbodun, & Arowojolu, 2006). Pathophysiology Prolapse usually leads to total or partial occlusion of the cord. Since this is the fetus's only lifeline, fetal perfusiondeteriorates rapidly. Complete occlusion renders thefetus helpless and oxygen-deprived. The fetus will die ifthe cord compression is not relieved. Nursing Assessment Prevention is the key to managing cord prolapse by iden-tifying clients at risk for this condition. Carefully assesseach client to help predict her risk status. Be aware thatcord prolapse is more common in pregnancies involvingmalpresentation, growth restriction, prematurity, rup-tured membranes with a fetus at a high station, hydram-nios, grandmultiparity, and multifetal gestation (Dilbazet al., 2006). Continuously assess the client and fetus todetect changes and to evaluate the effectiveness of anyinterventions performed. Nursing Management Prompt recognition of a prolapsed cord is essential to reduce the risk of fetal hypoxia resulting from pro-longed cord compression. When membranes are artifi-cially ruptured, assist with verifying that the presenting11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 637638 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK UTERINE RUPTURE Uterine rupture is a catastrophic tearing of the uterus at the site of a previous scar into the abdominal cavity. Its onset isoften marked only by sudden fetal bradycardia, and treat-ment requires rapid surgery for good outcomes. From thetime of diagnosis to delivery, only 10 to 30 minutes areavailable before clinically signicant fetal morbidity occurs.Fetal morbidity occurs secondary to catastrophic hemor-rhage, fetal anoxia, or both. Nursing Assessment Review the mother's history for risk conditions such as uterine scars, prior cesarean births, prior rupture, trauma,prior invasive molar pregnancy, history of placenta perc-reta or increta, malpresentation, labor induction with ex-cessive uterine stimulation, and crack cocaine use (Nahum& Pham, 2007). Reviewing a client's history for risk factorsmight prove to be life-saving for both mother and fetus. Generally, the rst and most reliable symptom of uterine rupture is sudden fetal distress. Other signs mayinclude acute and continuous abdominal pain with orwithout an epidural, vaginal bleeding, hematuria, irregu-lar abdominal wall contour, loss of station in the fetal pre-senting part, and hypovolemic shock in the woman, fetus,or both (Nahum & Pham, 2007). Timely management of uterine rupture depends on prompt detection. Because many women desire a trial oflabor after a previous cesarean birth, the nurse must be fa-miliar with the signs and symptoms of uterine rupture. Itis difcult to prevent uterine rupture or to predict whichwomen will experience rupture, so constant preparednessis necessary. Screening all women with previous uterine surgical scars is important, and continuous electronic fetal moni-toring should be used during labor because this may pro-vide the only indication of an impending rupture. Nursing Management Because the presenting signs may be nonspecic, the ini- tial management will be the same as that for any othercause of acute fetal distress. Urgent delivery by cesareanbirth is usually indicated. Monitor maternal vital signs andobserve for hypotension and tachycardia, which might in-dicate hypovolemic shock. Assist in preparing for an emer-gency cesarean birth by alerting the operating room staff,anesthesia provider, and neonatal team. Insert an in-dwelling urinary (Foley) catheter if one is not in place al-ready. Inform the woman of the seriousness of this eventand remind her that the health care staff will be workingquickly to ensure her health and that of her fetus. Remaincalm and provide reassurance that everything is being doneto ensure a safe outcome for both. The life-threatening nature of uterine rupture is under- scored by the fact that the maternal circulatory system de-livers approximately 500 mL of blood to the term uterusevery minute (Kennare et al., 2007). Maternal death is a real possibility without rapid intervention. Newborn out-come after rupture depends largely on the speed withwhich surgical rescue is carried out. AMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare and often fatal event characterized by the sudden onset of hypotension, hy-poxia, and coagulopathy. Amniotic fluid containing parti-cles of debris (e.g., hair, skin, vernix, or meconium) entersthe maternal circulation and obstructs the pulmonary ves-sels, causing respiratory distress and circulatory collapse(O'Shea & Eappen, 2007). The incidence is approximately1 case per 8,000 to 80,000 pregnancies and carries a ma-ternal mortality rate as high as 80% (Schoening, 2007). Pathophysiology Normally, amniotic fluid does not enter the maternal cir-culation because it is contained within the uterus, sealedoff by the amniotic sac. An embolus occurs when the bar-rier between the maternal circulation and the amnioticfluid is broken and amniotic fluid enters the maternal ve-nous system via the endocervical veins, the placental site(if the placenta is separated), or a site of uterine trauma.This condition has a high mortality rate: as many as 50%of women die within the first hour after the onset ofsymptoms, and about 85% of survivors have permanenthypoxia-induced neurologic damage (Moore, 2006). Although medical science has supplied many answers to questions about this condition, health care providersremain largely unable to predict or prevent an amnioticfluid embolism or to decrease its mortality rate. Nursing Assessment No test can diagnose an amniotic fluid embolism. There-fore, the nurse's assessment skills are critical. Immediaterecognition and diagnosis of this condition are essential toimprove maternal and fetal outcomes. Until recently, thediagnosis could be made only after an autopsy of themother revealed squamous cells, lanugo hair, or other fetaland amniotic material in the pulmonary arterial vascula-ture (Gilbert, 2007). The clinical appearance is varied, but most women re- port difculty breathing. Other symptoms include hypo-tension, cyanosis, seizures, tachycardia, coagulation failure, When excessive bleeding occurs during the childbirth process and it persists or signs such as bruising or petechiae appear, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 638CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 639 disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary edema, uterine atony with subsequent hemorrhage, adult respi-ratory distress syndrome, and cardiac arrest (Moore &Ware, 2007).and vaginal birth following a previous cesarean birth. Nurses play a major role in helping the couple to copewith any unanticipated procedures by offering thoroughexplanations of the procedure, its anticipated benets andrisks, and any other options available. AMNIOINFUSION Amnioinfusion is a technique in which a volume of warmed, sterile, normal saline or Ringer's lactate solutionis introduced into the uterus through an intrauterine pres-sure catheter to increase the volume of fluid when oligo-hydramnios is present (Boyd & Carter, 2008). It is used tochange the relationship of the uterus, placenta, cord, andfetus to improve placental and fetal oxygenation. Instillingan isotonic glucose-free solution into the uterus helps tocushion the umbilical cord or dilute thick meconium (Xuet al., 2007). This procedure is commonly indicated for severe vari- able decelerations due to cord compression, insufciency, or ruptureof with and thick meconium fluid. However, it doesnot prevent meconium aspiration syndrome (ACOG,2006). Contraindications to amnioinfusion include vagi-nal bleeding of unknown origin, umbilical cord prolapse,amnionitis, uterine hypertonicity, and severe fetal distress(ACOG, 2006). There is no standard protocol for amnioinfusion. After obtaining informed consent, a vaginal examinationis performed to evaluate for cord prolapse, establish dila-tion, and conrm presentation. Next, 250 to 500 mL ofwarmed normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution is ad-ministered using an infusion pump over 20 to 30 minutes.Overdistention of the uterus is a risk, so the amount offluid infused must be monitored closely (Boyd & Carter,2008). When caring for the woman who is receiving an amnioinfusion, include the following: Explain the need for the procedure, what it involves, and how it may solve the problem. Inform the mother that she will need to remain on bed rest during the procedure. Assess the mother's vital signs and associated discom- fort level. Maintain intake and output records. Assess the duration and intensity of uterine contrac- tions frequently to identify overdistention or increaseduterine tone. Monitor the FHR pattern to determine whether the amnioinfusion is improving the fetal status. Prepare the mother for a possible cesarean birth if the FHR does not improve after the amnioinfusion. Amniotic fluid embolism should be sus- pected in any pregnant women with an acute onset of dyspnea, hypotension, and disseminatedintravascular coagulation. By knowing how to inter-vene, the nurse can promote a better chance of survivalfor both the mother and her newborn.Take NOTE! Nursing Management Upon recognizing the signs and symptoms, institute sup-portive measures: oxygenation (resuscitation and 100%oxygen), circulation (intravenous and pressure), hemorrhage and coagulopathy (oxytocic agents to con-trol uterine atony and bleeding), seizure precautions, andadministration of steroids to control the inflammatoryresponse (Schoening, 2007). Care is largely supportive and aimed at maintaining oxygenation and hemodynamic function and correctingcoagulopathy. There is no specific therapy that is life-saving once this condition starts. Adequate oxygenation isnecessary, with endotracheal intubation and mechanicalventilation for most stability. Management of dissemi-nated intravascular coagulation may involve replacementwith packed red blood cells plasma as nec-essary. Oxytocin infusions and prostaglandin analogs canbe used to address uterine atony. Explain to the client and family what is happening and what therapies are being instituted. The woman is usuallytransferred to a critical care unit for intensive observationand care. Assist the family to express their feelings and pro-vide support as needed. WOMEN REQUIRING BIRTH-RELATED PROCEDURES Most women can give birth without the need for opera- tive obstetric interventions. Most will expect to have a\"natural\" birth experience and don't anticipate the needfor medical intervention. However, in some situationsinterventions are necessary to safeguard the health of themother and fetus. The most common birth-related proce-dures are amnioinfusion, birth,11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT FIGURE21.6 Forceps delivery. ( A) Example of forceps. ( B) Forceps being applied to the fetus. B A FIGURE21.7 Vacuum extractor for delivery. ( A) Example of a vacuum extractor. ( B) Vacuum extractor applied to the fetal head to assist in delivery. A BFORCEPS- OR VACUUM- ASSISTED BIRTH Forceps or a vacuum extractor may be used to apply trac- tion to the fetal head or to provide a method of rotating thefetal head during birth. Forceps are stainless-steel instru- ments, similar to tongs, with rounded edges that t aroundthe fetus's head. Some forceps have open blades and somehave solid blades. Outlet forceps are used when the fetalhead is crowning and low forceps are used when thefetal head is at a +2 station or lower but not yet crowning. The forceps are applied to the sides of the fetal head. Thetype of forceps used is determined by the birth attendant.All forceps have a locking mechanism that prevents theblades from compressing the fetal skull (Fig. 21.6). A vacuum extractor is a cup-shaped instrument at- tached to a suction pump used for extraction of the fetalhead (Fig. 21.7). The suction cup is placed against the oc- ciput of the fetal head. The pump is used to create nega-tive pressure (suction) of approximately 50 to 60 mmHg.The birth attendant then applies traction until the fetalhead emerges from the vagina. The indications for the use of either method are simi- lar and include a prolonged second stage of labor, a non-reassuring FHR pattern, failure of the presenting part tofully rotate and descend in the pelvis, limited sensation andinability to push effectively due to the effects of regionalanesthesia, presumed fetal jeopardy or fetal distress, ma-ternal heart disease, acute pulmonary edema, intrapartuminfection, maternal fatigue, or infection (Pope & O'Grady,2006). The use of forceps or a vacuum extractor poses the risk of tissue trauma to the mother and the newborn. Ma-ternal trauma may include lacerations of the cervix, vagina,11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 640CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 641 or perineum; hematoma; extension of the ecchymoses, facial and scalp lac-erations, facial nerve injury, cephalhematoma, and caputsuccedaneum (Cunningham et al., 2005). Prevention is key to reducing the use of these tech- niques. Preventive measures include frequently changingthe client's position, encouraging ambulation if permitted,frequently reminding the client to empty her bladder toallow maximum space for birth, and providing adequatehydration throughout labor. Additional measures in-clude assessing maternal vital signs, the contraction pat-tern, the fetal status, and the maternal response to the procedure. Provide a thorough explanation of the proce-dure and the rationale for its use. Reassure the mother thatany marks or swelling on the newborn's head or face willdisappear without treatment within 2 to 3 days. Alert thepostpartum nursing staff about the use of the technique sothat they can observe for any bleeding or infection relatedto genital lacerations. CESAREAN BIRTH A cesarean birth is the delivery of the fetus through an incision in the abdomen and uterus. A classic (vertical) orlow transverse incision may be used; today, the low trans-verse incision is more common (Fig. 21.8). High cesarean birth rates are an international con- cern. The number of cesarean births has steadily risen inthe United States: today approximately 29% or one inthree births occur this way (ACOG, 2008). Althoughthere has been some decline in rates since the 1980s, theUnited States still has a way to go to reduce its surgical birth rates (USDHHS, 2000). Several factors may explain this increased incidence of cesarean deliveries: the use of electronic fetal monitoring,which identies fetal distress early; the reduced number offorceps-assisted births; older maternal age and reducedparity, with more nulliparous women having infants; con-venience to the client and doctor; and a increase in mal-practice suits (Katz, 2006). Cesarean birth is a major surgical procedure with in- creased risks compared to a vaginal birth. The client is atrisk for complications such as infection, hemorrhage, aspi-ration, also may occur(Gagnon, Meir, & Waghorn, 2007). Spinal, epidural, or general anesthesia is used for ce- sarean births. Epidural anesthesia is most commonly usedtoday because it is associated with less risk and mostwomen wish to be awake and aware of the birth experience. Nursing Assessment Review the woman's history for indications associatedwith cesarean birth and complete a physical examination.Any condition that prevents the safe passage of the fetusthrough the birth canal or that seriously compromises ma-ternal or fetal well-being may be an indication for a ce-sarean birth. Examples include active or scar,gestational hypertension, diabetes, positive HIV status,and dystocia. Fetal indications include malpresentation(nonvertex presentation), congenital anomalies (fetal neu-ral tube defects, hydrocephalus, abdominal wall defects),and fetal distress (Humenick, 2006). Nursing Management Once the decision has been made to proceed with a ce-sarean birth, assess the woman's knowledge of the proce-dure and necessary preparation. Assist with obtainingdiagnostic tests as ordered. These tests are usually orderedto ensure the well-being of both parties and may include acomplete blood count; urinalysis to rule out infection;blood type and cross-match so that blood is available fortransfusion if needed; an ultrasound to determine fetal po-sition and placental location; and an amniocentesis to de-termine fetal lung maturity if needed. Although the nurse's role in a cesarean birth can be very technical and skill-oriented at times, the focus mustremain on the woman, not the equipment surrounding thebed. Care should be centered on the family, not the sur-gery. Provide education and minimize separation of themother, father, and newborn. Remember that the client isanxious and concerned about her welfare as well as that of FIGURE21.8 Low transverse incision for cesarean birth. 11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 641642 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK her child. Use touch, eye contact, therapeutic communi- cation, and genuine caring to provide couples with a posi-tive birth experience, regardless of the type of delivery. Providing Preoperative Care Client preparation varies depending on whether the ce-sarean birth is planned or unplanned. The major differ-ence is the time allotted for preparation and teaching. Inan unplanned cesarean birth, institute measures quickly toensure the best outcomes for the mother and fetus. Ensurethat the woman has signed an informed consent, and allowfor discussion of fears and expectations. Provide essentialteaching and explanations to reduce the woman's fears andanxieties. Ascertain the client's and family's understanding of the surgical procedure. Reinforce the reasons for surgerygiven by the surgeon. Outline the procedure and expec-tations of the surgical experience. Ensure that all diag-nostic tests ordered have been completed, and evaluatethe results. Explain to the woman and her family aboutwhat to expect postoperatively. Reassure the woman thatpain management will be provided throughout the pro-cedure and afterward. Encourage the woman to reportany pain. Ask the woman about the time she last had anything to eat or drink. Document the time and what was con-sumed. Throughout the preparations, assess maternal andfetal status frequently. Provide preoperative teaching to reduce the risk of postoperative complications. Demonstrate the use of theincentive spirometer and deep-breathing and leg exer-cises. Instruct the woman on how to splint her incision. Complete the preoperative procedures, which may include: Preparing the surgical site as ordered Starting an intravenous infusion for fluid replacement therapy as ordered Inserting an indwelling (Foley) catheter and informing the client about how long it will remain in place (usu-ally 24 hours) Administering any preoperative medications as ordered; documenting the time administered and the client'sreaction Maintain a calm, condent manner in all interactions with the client and family. Help transport the client andher partner to the operative area. Providing Postoperative Care Postoperative care for the mother who has had a cesarean delivery is similar to that for one who has had a vaginalbirth, with a few additional measures. Assess vital signsand lochia flow every 15 minutes for the rst hour, thenevery 30 minutes for the next hour, and then every 4 hoursif stable. Assist with perineal care and instruct the client inthe same. Inspect the abdominal dressing and documentdescription, including any evidence of drainage. Assess uterine tone to determine fundal rmness. Check the pa-tency of the intravenous line, making sure the infusion isflowing at the correct rate. Inspect the infusion site fre-quently for redness. Assess the woman's level of consciousness if sedative drugs were administered. Institute safety precautionsuntil the woman is fully alert and responsive. If a regionalanesthetic was used, monitor for the return of sensationto the legs. Assess for evidence of abdominal distention and auscultate bowel sounds. Assist with early ambulationto prevent respiratory and cardiovascular problems andto promote peristalsis. Monitor intake and output atleast every 4 hours initially and then every 8 hours asindicated. Encourage the woman to cough, perform deep- breathing exercises, and use the incentive spirometer every2 hours. Administer analgesics as ordered and providecomfort measures, such as splinting the incision and pil-lows for positioning. Assist the client to move in bed andturn side to side to improve circulation. Also encourage thewoman to ambulate to promote venous return from theextremities. Encourage early touching and holding of the newborn to promote bonding. Assist with breastfeeding initiationand offer continued support. Suggest alternate positioningtechniques to reduce incisional discomfort while breast-feeding. Review with the couple their perception of the surgi- cal birth experience. Allow them to verbalize their feelingsand assist them in positive coping measures. Prior to dis-charge, teach the woman about the need for adequate rest,activity restrictions such as lifting, and signs and symptomsof infection. VAGINAL BIRTH AFTER CESAREAN Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) describes a woman who gives birth vaginally after having at least oneprevious cesarean birth. Despite evidence that somewomen who have had a cesarean birth are candidates forvaginal birth, most women who have had a cesarean birth once undergo another for subsequent pregnancies (Caughey, 2006). The choice of a vaginal or a repeat cesarean birth can be offered to women who had a lower abdominal incision.However, controversy remains. The argument againstVBAC focuses on the risk of uterine rupture and hemor-rhage. Although the risk of uterine rupture is relatively low,the rate of fetal mortality in the event of a uterine ruptureis extremely high.11223-21_CH21.qxd 8/4/08 3:04 PM Page 642CHAPTER 21 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF LABOR AND BIRTH AT RISK 643 Contraindications to VBAC include a prior classic uterine incision, prior transfundal uterine surgery (my-omectomy), uterine scar other than low-transverse ce-sarean scar, contracted pelvis, and inadequate staff orfacility if an emergency cesarean birth in the event of uter-ine rupture is required (Caughey, 2006). Most women gothrough a trial of labor to see how they progress, but thismust be performed in an environment capable of handlingthe emergency of uterine rupture. The use of cervicalripening agents increases the risk of uterine rupture andthus is contraindicated in VBAC clients. The woman con-sidering induction of labor after a previous cesarean birthneeds to be informed of the increased risk of uterine rup-ture with an induction than with spontaneous labor(Meddings et al., 2007). Women are the primary decision makers about the choice of birth method, but they need education aboutVBAC during their prenatal course. Management is sim-ilar for any women experiencing labor, but certain areasrequire special focus: Consent: Fully informed consent is essential for the woman who wants to have a trial of labor after cesareanbirth. The client must be advised about the risks as wellas the benets. She must understand the ramicationsof uterine rupture, even though the risk is small. Documentation: Recordkeeping is an important com- ponent of safe client care. If and when an emergencyoccurs, it is imperative to take care of the client, butalso to keep track of the plan of care, interventions andtheir timing, and the client's response. Events and ac-tivities can be written right on the fetal monitoring trac-ing to correlate with the change in fetal status. Surveillance: A nonreassuring fetal monitor tracing in a woman undergoing a trial of labor after a cesarean birthshould alert the nurse to the possibility of uterine rup-ture. Terminal bradycardia must be considered anemergency situation, and the nurse should prepare theteam for an emergency delivery. Readiness for emergency: According to ACOG criteria for a safe trial of labor for a woman who has had a pre-vious cesarean birth, the physician, anesthesia provider,and operating room team must be immediately avail-able. Anything less would place the women and fetus atrisk (ACOG, 2004a). Nurses must act as advocates, giving input on the ap- propriate selection of women who wish to undergo VBAC.Nurses also need to become experts at reading fetal mon-itoring tracings to identify a nonreassuring pattern and setin motion an emergency delivery. Including all these nurs-ing strategies will make VBAC safer for all. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key epidural analgesia, posterior position, longer rst stage of labor, nul-liparity, short maternal stature (<5 feet tall), high birthweight, maternal age older than 35 years, gestational age more than 41 weeks, chorioamnionitis, pelvic con-tractions, macrosomia, and high station at completecervical dilation. /H18546Dystocia may result from problems in the powers, pas- senger, passageway, or psyche. /H18546Problems involving the powers that lead to dystocia include hypertonic uterine dysfunction, hypotonicuterine dysfunction, and precipitous labor. /H18546Management of hypertonic labor pattern involves ther- apeutic rest with the use of sedatives to promote relax-ation and stop the abnormal activity of the uterus. /H18546Any presentation other than occiput or a slight variation of the fetal position or size increases the probability ofdystocia. /H18546Multiple gestation may result in dysfunctional labor due to uterine overdistention, which may lead to hypotonicdystocia, and abnormal presentations of the fetuses. /H18546During labor, evaluation of fetal descent, cervical ef- facement and dilation, and characteristics of uterinecontractions are paramount to determine progress orlack thereof. /H18546Antepartum assessment for a postterm pregnancy typ- ically includes daily fetal movement counts done by thewoman, nonstress tests done twice weekly, amnioticfluid assessments as part of the biophysical prole, andweekly cervical examinations to check for ripening forinduction. /H18546Once the cervix is ripe, oxytocin is the most popular pharmacologic agent used for inducing or augmentinglabor. /H18546Generally, the rst and most reliable symptom of uter- ine rupture is fetal distress. /H18546Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but often fatal event characterized by the sudden onset of hypotension, hy-poxia, and coagulopathy. /H18546Cesarean births have steadily risen in the United States; today, approximately one in ve births occursthis way. Cesarean birth is a major surgical procedureand has increased risks over vaginal birth. REFERENCES Abenhaim, H., Kinch, R., Morin, L., Benjamin, A., & Usher, R. (2007).

It is a time lledwith many changes and wide-ranging emotions, and thenew mother commonly experiences a great sense of accom-plishment. However, the woman can experience deviationsfrom the norm, developing a postpartum condition thatplaces her at risk. These high-risk conditions or complica-tions can become life-threatening. Healthy People 2010addresses these risks in two National Health Goals. This chapter will address the nursing management of the most common conditions that place the postpartumwoman at risk: is a potentially life-threatening complication that can occur after both vaginal and cesarean births. It is the leading cause of maternal mortality world-wide: it is estimated that worldwide, 150,000 women dieof postpartum hemorrhage annually\u2014one every & Gynecolo gists [ACOG], 2006). More than half of all maternal deathsoccur within 24 hours of giving birth, most commonly fromexcessive bleeding. Postpartum hemorrhage is dened as a blood loss greater than 500 mL after vaginal birth or more than1,000 mL after a cesarean birth. Blood loss that occurs within 24 hours of birth is termed early postpartum hemor- rhage; blood loss that occurs 24 hours to 6 weeks after birth is termed late postpartum hemorrhage. However, this deni- tion is arbitrary, because estimates of blood loss at birthare subjective and generally inaccurate. Studies have sug-648 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK gested that health care providers consistently underesti- mate actual blood loss (Smith & Brennan, 2007). A moreobjective denition of postpartum hemorrhage would beany amount of bleeding that places the mother in hemo-dynamic jeopardy. Pathophysiology Excessive bleeding can occur at any time between theseparation of the placenta and its expulsion or removal.The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage isuterine atony , failure of the uterus to contract and re- tract after birth. The uterus must remain contracted afterbirth to control bleeding from the placental site. Any fac-tor that causes the uterus to relax after birth will causebleeding\u2014even a full bladder that displaces the uterus. Over the course of a pregnancy, maternal blood vol- ume increases by approximately 50% (from 4 to 6 L).The plasma volume increases twice as much in compari-son to the total red blood cell volume. As a result, hemo-globin and hematocrit fall. The increase in blood volumemeets the perfusion demands of the low-resistance utero- placental unit and provides a reserve for the blood lossthat occurs at delivery (Cunningham et al., 2005). Giventhis increase, the typical signs of hemorrhage (e.g., fall-ing blood pressure, increasing pulse rate, and decreas-ing urinary output) do not appear until as much as1,800 to 2,100 mL of blood has been lost (Gilbert andHarmon, 2007). In addition, accurate determination ofactual blood loss is difficult because of blood pooling in-side the uterus, on peripads, mattresses, and the floor.Since no universal clinical standard exists, nurses mustremain vigilant, assessing for risk factors and checkingclients carefully before the birth attendant leaves thebirthing area. Other causes of postpartum hemorrhage include lac- erations the vagina, or subperitoneal areas(ACOG, 2006). A helpful way to remember the causes ofpostpartum hemorrhage is by using the \"4 Ts\": tone, tis-sue, trauma, and thrombosis (Anderson & Etches, 2007). Tone Altered uterine muscle tone most commonly results fromoverdistention of the uterus. Overdistention can be causedby multifetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios,fetal abnormality, or placental fragments. causesmight include prolonged labor, especiallyif stimulated; bacterial (e.g., halo-thane; and magnesium sulfate used in the treatment ofpreeclampsia (Nash, 2007). Overdistention of the uterus isa major risk factor for uterine atony, the most commoncause of early postpartum hemorrhage, which can lead tohypovolemic shock.T Reduce maternal deaths from a baseline of 7.1 maternaldeaths per 100,000 live birthsto 3.3 maternal deaths per100,000 live births.

Classic signs ofplacental separation include a small gush of blood withlengthening of the umbilical cord and a slight rise of theuterus in the pelvis. Complete detachment and expulsionof the placenta permit continued contraction and optimalocclusion of blood vessels. Failure of complete placentalseparation and expulsion leads to retained fragments,which occupy space and prevent the uterus from con-tracting fully to clamp down on blood vessels; this canlead to hemorrhage. After the placenta is expelled, a thor-ough inspection is necessary to conrm its intactness;tears or fragments left inside may indicate an accessorylobe or placenta accreta (an uncommon condition inwhich the myometrium, caus-ing the placenta to adhere abnormally to the uterus andnot separate and deliver spontaneously). Profuse hemor-rhage results because the uterus cannot contract fully. A prolapse of the uterine fundus to or through the cervix so that the uterus is turned inside out after birth iscalled uterine inversion . This condition is associated with grand multiparity, abnormal adherence of the pla-centa, excessive traction on the umbilical cord, vigorousfundal pressure, precipitous labor, or vigorous manual re-moval of the placenta. Acute postpartum uterine inversionis rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2,000 births(Pope & O'Grady, 2006). Prompt recognition and rapidtreatment to replace the inverted uterus will avoid morbid-ity and mortality for this serious complication (Smith &Brennan, 2006). Subinvolution refers to incomplete involution of the uterus or failure to return to its normal size and conditionafter birth (Dorland, 2007). Complications of subinvolu-tion include hemorrhage, placental fragments,distended bladder, uterine myoma, and infection. All ofthese conditions contribute to delayed postpartum bleed-ing. The clinical picture includes a postpartum fundalheight that is higher than expected, with a boggy uterus;the lochia fails to change colors from red to serosa to albawithin a few weeks. This condition is usually identied atthe woman's postpartum examination 4 to 6 weeks afterbirth with a bimanual vaginal examination or ultrasound.Treatment is directed toward stimulating the uterus toexpel fragments with a uterine stimulant, and antibioticsare given to prevent infection. Trauma Damage to the genital tract may occur spontaneously orthrough the manipulations used during birth. Lacerationsand hematomas resulting from birth trauma can cause sig-nicant blood loss. Hematomas can present as pain or asa change in vital signs disproportionate to the amount ofblood loss. Uterine inversion can occur secondary to pres-CHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 649 sure or pulling on the umbilical cord when the placenta is still rmly attached to the fundus after the infant has beenborn. Additionally, uterine rupture can cause damage tothe genital tract and is more common in women with pre-vious cesarean incisions or those who had undergone anyprocedure resulting in disruption of the uterine wall, in-cluding myomectomy, of intrauterinedevice (IUD) insertion (Smith & Brennan, 2006). Trauma can also occur after prolonged or vigorous labor, especially if the uterus has been stimulated withoxytocin or prostaglandins. Trauma can also occur afterextrauterine or intrauterine manipulation of the fetus. Cervical lacerations commonly occur during a forceps delivery or in mothers who have not been able to resistbearing down before the cervix is fully dilated. Vaginal side-wall lacerations are associated with operative vaginal birthsbut may occur spontaneously, especially if the fetal handpresents with the head. Lacerations can arise duringmanipulations to resolve shoulder dystocia. Lacerationsshould always be suspected in the face of a contracteduterus with bright-red blood continuing to trickle out ofthe vagina. Thrombosis Thrombosis (blood clots) helps to prevent postpartumhemorrhage after birth by providing hemo-stasis. Fibrin deposits and clots in supplying vessels play asignicant role in the hours and days after birth. Disordersthat interfere with the clot formation can lead to postpar- tum hemorrhage. Medication used to prevent hemorrhageby stimulating uterine contractions may delay the appear-ance of coagulation disorders. Coagulopathies should besuspected when postpartum cause (ACOG, 2006). Ideally, the client's coagulation status is determined during pregnancy. However, if she received no prenatalcare, coagulation studies should be ordered immediatelyto determine her status. Abnormal results typically in-clude decreased platelet and brinogen levels, increasedprothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and brindegradation products, and a prolonged bleeding time(Anderson & Etches, 2007). Conditions associated withcoagulopathies in the develop-ment of autoantibodies to platelet-membrane antigens.The incidence of ITP in adults is approximately 66 casesper 1 million per year (Silverman, 2007). Thrombocyto-penia, capillary fragility, and increased bleeding time de-ne the disorder, commonly manifested by easy bruising,bleeding hemorrhage after a cesarean birth or lacerations (Sood & Abrams, 2007).Glucocorticoids and immune globulin are the mainstays ofmedical therapy. von Willebrand Disease von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a congenital bleedingdisorder, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It ischaracterized by a prolonged bleeding time, a deciencyof von Willebrand factor, and impairment of platelet ad-hesion (Dorland, 2007). In the United States, it is esti-mated to affect fewer than 3% of the population (Geil,2007). Most cases remain undiagnosed due to lack ofawareness, difculty in diagnosis, a tendency to attributebleeding to other causes, and variable symptoms (Kadiret al., 2007). The disorder is characterized by excessivebruising, prolonged nosebleeds, and prolonged oozingfrom wounds after surgery and after childbirth. The goalof therapy is to correct the defect in platelet adhesivenessby raising the level of von Willebrand factor with & Lippi, 2007). is a life-threatening, acquired pathologic process in which theclotting system is abnormally activated, resulting in wide- spread clot formation in the small vessels throughout thebody (Levi & Schmaier, 2007). It can cause postpartumhemorrhage by altering the blood clotting mechanism.DIC is always a secondary diagnosis that occurs as a com- plication of abruptio placentae, amniotic fluid embolism,intrauterine fetal death with prolonged retention of thefetus, severe preeclampsia, septicemia, and during birth, andacute renal failure (Bick, 2007). Treatment goals are tomaintain tissue perfusion through aggressive administra-tion of fluid therapy, oxygen, heparin, and blood products. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management focuses on the underlying cause of the hemorrhage. For example, uterine massage is usedto treat uterine atony. If retained placental fragments arethe cause, the fragments are usually manually separatedand removed and a uterine stimulant is given to promotethe uterus to expel fragments. Antibiotics are administeredto prevent infection. Lacerations are sutured or repaired.Glucocorticoids and may be given.A splenectomy may be necessary if the bleeding tissues donot respond to medical management. In vWD, there is a decrease in von Willebrand factor, which is necessary for platelet adhesion and aggregation.It binds to and stabilizes factor coagulation cas-cade (Franchini & Lippi, 2007). Desmopressin, a syn-650 CHILDBEARING AT RISK thetic form of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), may be used to treat vWD. This drug stimulates the release ofstored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor from the lin-ing of blood vessels, which increases platelet adhesivenessand shortens bleeding time. Other treatments that may beordered include clotting factor concentrates, replacementof von Willebrand factor VIII (Alphanate,Humate-P); (NSAIDs) that do causeplatelet dysfunction (Geil, 2007). Nursing Assessment Pregnancy and childbirth involve signicant health risks, even for women with no preexisting health problems.There are an estimated 14 million cases of pregnancy-related hemorrhage every year, with some of these womenbleeding to death. Most of these deaths occur within 4 hours of giving birth and are a result of problems duringthe third stage of labor (ACOG, 2006). The period afterthe birth and the rst hours postpartum are crucial timesfor the prevention, assessment, and management of bleed-ing. Compared with other maternal risks such as infection,bleeding can rapidly become life-threatening, and nurses,along with other health care providers, need to identify thiscondition quickly and intervene appropriately. Begin by reviewing the mother's history, including labor and birth history, for risk factors associated withpostpartum hemorrhage (Box 22.1). Since the most common cause of immediate severe postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony (failure of the BOX 22.1 Factors Placing a Woman at Risk for Postpartum Hemorrhage Prolonged rst, second, or third stage of labor Previous history of postpartum hemorrhage Multiple gestation Fetal macrosomia Uterine infection Manual extraction of placenta Arrest of descent Maternal exhaustion, malnutrition, or anemia Mediolateral episiotomy Preeclampsia Precipitous birth Maternal hypotension Previous placenta previa Coagulation abnormalities Birth canal lacerations Operative birth (forceps or vacuum) Augmented labor with medication Coagulation abnormalities Grand multiparity Polyhydramnios (Anderson & Etches, 2007)11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 650uterus to contract properly after birth), assess uterine tone after birth by palpating the fundus for rmness andlocation. A soft, boggy fundus indicates uterine atony.CHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 651 Inspect the skin and mucous membranes for gingival bleeding or petechiae and ecchymoses. Check venipunc-ture sites for oozing or prolonged bleeding. These ndingsmight suggest a coagulopathy as a cause of postpartumhemorrhage. Also assess the amount of lochia, which wouldbe much greater than usual. Urinary output would be di-minished, with signs of acute renal failure. Vital signs wouldshow an increased pulse rate and a decreased level of con-sciousness. However, signs of shock do not appear untilhemorrhage is far advanced due to the increased fluid andblood volume of pregnancy. Nursing Management Massage the uterus if uterine atony is noted. The uterinemuscles are sensitive to touch; massage stimulates themuscle bers to contract. Massage the boggy uterus tostimulate contractions and expression of any accumulatedblood clots while supporting the lower uterine segment.As blood pools in the vagina, stasis of blood causes clotsto form; they need to be expelled as pressure is placed onthe fundus. Overly forceful massage can tire the uterinemuscles, resulting in further uterine atony and increasedpain. See Nursing Procedure 22.1 for the steps in massag-ing the fundus. If repeated fundal massage and expression of clots fail, medication is probably needed to cause the uterus tocontract in order to control bleeding from the placentalsite. The injection of an uterotonic drug immediatelyafter birth is an important to manage hemorrhage (DrugGuide 22.1). However, misoprostol is not approved bythe U.S. Food and Drug Association for this purpose.The choice of which uterotonic drug to use for manage-ment of bleeding depends on the judgment of the healthcare provider, the availability of drugs, and the risks andbenets of the drug. Remember Joan, the woman described at the beginning of the chapter? The nurse assesses her and nds that her uterusis boggy. What would the nurse do next? What additionalnursing measures might be used if Joan's fundus remainsboggy? When should the health care provider be notied? Maintain the primary IV infusion and be prepared to start a second infusion at another site if blood transfusionsare necessary. Draw blood for type and cross-match andsend it to the laboratory. Administer oxytocics as ordered,correlating and titrating the infusion rate to assessmentndings of uterine rmness and lochia. Assess for visiblevaginal bleeding, and count or weigh perineal pads. A soft, boggy uterus that deviates from the midline suggests that a full bladder is inter- fering with uterine involution. If the uterus is not incorrect position (midline), it will not be able to contractto control bleeding.Take NOTE! Assess the amount of bleeding. If bleeding continues even though there are no lacerations, suspect retainedplacental fragments. The uterus remains large with pain-less, dark-red bleeding mixed with clots. This cause ofhemorrhage can be prevented by carefully inspecting theplacenta for intactness. If trauma is suspected, attempt to identify the source and document it. Typically, the uterus will be rm with asteady stream or trickle of unclotted bright-red blood notedin the perineum. Most deaths from postpartum hemor-rhage are not due to gross bleeding, but rather to inade-quate management of slow, steady blood loss (Anderson &Etches, 2007). Assess for hematoma. The uterus would be rm, with bright-red bleeding. Observe for a localized bluishbulging area just under the skin surface in the perinealarea (Fig. 22.1). Often the woman will report severeperineal or pelvic pain and will have difculty voiding. Inaddition, she may exhibit swollen mass.11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 651Check vital signs every 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the acuity of the mother's health status. Monitor hercomplete blood count to identify any decit or assess theadequacy of replacement. Assess the woman's level ofconsciousness to determine changes that may result frominadequate cerebral perfusion. If a full bladder is present, assist the woman to empty her bladder to reduce displacement of the uterus. If thewoman cannot void, anticipate the need to catheterizeher to relieve bladder distention. Prepare the woman for removal of retained placental fragments. These usually are manually separated and re-moved by the health care provider. Be sure that the healthcare provider remains long enough after birth to assess thebleeding status of the woman and determine the etiology.Assist the health care provider with suturing any lacerationsimmediately to control hemorrhage and repair the tissue.652 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Continually assess the woman for signs and symp- toms of hemorrhagic shock, a condition in which inade-quate perfusion of organs results in insufcient availabilityof oxygen to satisfy the metabolic needs of the tissues(Dorland, 2007). Subsequently a catabolic state develops,leading to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, anddisruption of normal metabolic processes in vital organs.Once these events become established, the process ofshock is often irreversible, even if volume and red bloodcell decits are corrected (Cohen, 2006). Monitor the woman's blood pressure, pulse, capillary rell, mental status, and urinary output. These assessmentsallow estimation of the severity of blood loss and help di-rect treatment. If the woman develops hemorrhagic shock,interventions focus on controlling the source of blood loss;restoring adequate oxygen-carrying capacity; and main-taining adequate tissue perfusion. Successful treatment de-pends on efcient collaboration among all health care teammembers to meet the woman's specic needs. For the woman with ITP, expect to administer gluco- corticoids, IV immunoglobulin, IV anti-RhoD, and platelettransfusions. Prepare the woman for a splenectomy if thebleeding tissues do not respond to medical management. Be alert for women with abnormal bleeding tenden- cies, ensuring that they receive proper diagnosis and treat-ment. Teach them how to prevent severe hemorrhage byNursing Procedure 22.1 MASSAGING THE FUNDUS Purpose: To Promote Uterine Contraction 1. After explaining the procedure to the woman, place one gloved hand (usually the dominant hand) on the fundus. 2. Place the other gloved hand on the area above the sym- physis pubis (this helps to support the lower uterinesegment). 3. With the hand on the fundus, gently massage the fun- dus in a circular manner. Be careful not to overmassagethe fundus, which could lead to muscle fatigue anduterine relaxation. 4. Assess for uterine rmness (uterine tissue responds quickly to touch). 5. If rm, apply gentle yet rm pressure in a downward motion toward the vagina to express any clots that mayhave accumulated. 6. Do not attempt to express clots until the fundus is rm because the application of rm pressure on an uncon-tracted uterus could cause uterine inversion, leading tomassive hemorrhage. 7. Assist the woman with perineal care and applying a new perineal pad. 8. Remove gloves and wash hands. When weighing perineal pads to determine blood loss, remember that 1 g of pad weight is equivalent to 1 mL of blood loss (Cohen, 2006).Take NOTE! 11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 652learning how to feel for and massage their fundus when boggy, assisting the nurse to keep track of the number ofand amount of bleeding on perineal pads, and avoiding anymedications with antiplatelet activity such as aspirin, anti-histamines, or NSAIDs. If the woman develops DIC, institute emergency measures to control bleeding and impending shock andprepare to transfer her to the intensive care unit. Identi-cation of the underlying condition and elimination of thecausative factor are essential to correct the coagulationproblem. Be ready to replace fluid volume, administerblood component therapy, and optimize the mother's oxy-genation and perfusion status to ensure adequate cardiacoutput and end-organ perfusion. Continually reassess thewoman's coagulation status via laboratory studies. Monitor vital signs closely, being alert for changes that signal an increase in bleeding or impending shock.Observe for signs of bleeding, including spontaneousbleeding from gums or nose, petechiae, excessive bleed-ing from the cesarean incision site, hematuria, and bloodin the stool. These ndings correlate with decreased bloodvolume, decreased organ and peripheral tissue perfusion,and clots in the microcirculation (Bick, 2007).CHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 653 Institute measures to avoid tissue trauma or injury, such as giving injections and drawing blood.

Offer explanation to client and family about what is happening and the purpose of the medication. Provide nonpharmacologic comfort measures to assist with pain management. Set up the IV infusion to be piggybacked into a primary IV line. This ensures that the medication can be discontinued readily ifhyperstimulation or adverse effects occur while maintainingthe IV site and primary infusion. Assess baseline bleeding, uterine tone, and vital signs every 15 minutes or according to protocol. Offer explanation to client and family about what is happening and the purpose of the medication. Monitor for possible adverse effects, such as hypertension, seizures, uterine cramping, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations. Report any complaints of chest pain promptly. Assess vital signs, uterine contractions, client's comfort level, and bleeding status as per protocol. Offer explanation to client and family about what is happening and the purpose of the medication. Monitor for possible adverse effects, such as fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing, andbronchospasm. Always remember the four causes of post- partum hemorrhage and the appropriate intervention for atony\u2014massage andoxytocics; 2. NOTE! A n IV oxytocin infusion is started for Joan.

What dischargeinstructions need to be reinforced with Joan?11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 653Thromboembolic Conditions A thrombosis (blood clot within a blood vessel) can cause an inflammation of the blood vessel lining ( thrombo- phlebitis ), which in turn can lead to a thromboembolism (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot carried by thecirculation from the site of origin). Thrombi can involvethe supercial or deep veins in the legs or pelvis. Super-cial venous thrombosis usually involves the saphenousvenous system and is conned to the lower leg. Supercialthrombophlebitis may be caused by the use of the lithot-omy position during birth. Deep venous thrombosis caninvolve deep veins from the foot to the calf, to the thighs,or pelvis. In both locations, thrombi can dislodge andmigrate to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. The three most common thromboembolic conditions occurring during the postpartum period are than 1% of all postpartum women, pulmonary embo-lus can be fatal if a clot obstructs the lung circulation; thus,early identication and treatment are paramount. Thrombus (blood clot) formation results typically resultsfrom venous stasis, injury to the and hypercoagulation. Venous stasis andhypercoagulation are both common in the postpartumperiod. If a clot dislodges and travels to the pulmonary circu- lation, pulmonary embolism can occur. Pulmonary em-bolism is a potentially fatal condition that occurs when thepulmonary artery is blocked by a blood clot that has trav-eled from another vein into the lungs, causing an obstruc-tion and infarction. When the clot is large enough to blockone or more of the pulmonary vessels that supply thelungs, it can result in sudden death. Pulmonary embolismis the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in theUnited States, occurring in 2 out of 100,000 live births(Shaughnessy, 2007). Nursing Assessment Assess the woman closely for risk factors and signs andsymptoms of thrombophlebitis. Look for risk factors in thewoman's history such as use of oral contraceptives beforethe pregnancy, smoking, employment that necessitatesprolonged standing, history of thrombosis, thrombophle-bitis, or endometritis, or evidence of current varicosities.Also look for other factors that can increase a woman'srisk, such as prolonged bed rest, diabetes, obesity, cesareanbirth, progesterone-induced distensibility of the veins ofthe lower legs during pregnancy, severe anemia, varicoseveins, advanced maternal age (older than 35), and multi-parity (Feied & Handler, 2007). Ask the woman if she has pain or tenderness in the lower extremities. Suspect supercial venous thrombosis654 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK in a woman with varicose veins who reports tenderness and discomfort over the site of the thrombosis, mostcommonly in the calf area. The area appears reddenedalong the vein and is warm to the touch. The woman willreport increased pain in the affected leg when she ambu-lates and bears weight. Manifestations of deep venous thrombosis are often absent and diffuse. If they are present, they are caused byan inflammatory process and obstruction of venous re-turn. Calf swelling, erythema, warmth, tenderness, andpedal edema may be noted. A positive Homans' sign(pain in the calf upon dorsiflexion) is not a denitive di-agnostic sign and is no longer recommended as an indi-cator of deep vein thrombosis because calf pain can alsobe caused by a strained muscle or contusion (Feied &Handler, 2007). Be alert for signs and symptoms of pulmonary em- bolism, including unexplained sudden onset of shortnessof breath and severe chest pain. The woman may be ap-prehensive and diaphoretic. Additional manifestationsmay include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, syn-cope, distention of the jugular decreased oxygensaturation (shown by pulse oximetry), cardiac arrhyth-mias, hemoptysis, and a sudden change in mental statusas a result of hypoxemia (Shaughnessy, 2007).

Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on preventing thromboticconditions, promoting adequate circulation if thrombosisoccurs, and educating the client about preventive mea-sures, anticoagulant therapy, and danger signs. Preventing Thrombotic Conditions Prevention of thrombotic conditions is an essential aspectof nursing management and can be achieved with theroutine use of simple measures: Developing public awareness about risk factors, symp- toms, and preventive measures Preventing venous stasis by encouraging activity that causes leg muscles to contract and promotes venousreturn (leg exercises and walking) Using intermittent sequential compression devices to produce passive leg muscle contractions until thewoman is ambulatory Elevating the woman's legs above her heart level to promote venous return Stopping smoking to reduce or prevent vascular vasoconstriction Applying compression stockings and removing them daily for inspection of legs Performing passive range-of-motion exercises while in bed Using postoperative deep-breathing exercises to improve venous return by relieving the negativethoracic pressure on leg veins11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 654 Reducing hypercoagulability with the use of warfarin, aspirin, and heparin Preventing venous pooling by avoiding pillows under knees, not crossing legs for long periods, and not leav-ing legs up in stirrups for long periods Padding stirrups to reduce pressure against the popliteal angle Avoiding sitting or standing in one position for pro- longed periods Using a bed cradle to keep linens and blankets off extremities Avoiding trauma to legs to prevent injury to the vein wall Increasing fluid intake to prevent dehydration Avoiding the use of oral contraceptives In women at risk, early ambulation is the easiest and most cost-effective method.

Standardheparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxa-parin (Lovenox) can be given, since neither drug crossesthe placenta. It is typically discontinued during labor andbirth and then restarted during the postpartum period. Promoting Adequate Circulation For the woman with supercial venous thrombosis, ad-minister NSAIDs for analgesia, provide for rest and ele-vation of the affected leg, apply warm compresses to theaffected area to promote healing, and use antiembolismstockings to promote circulation to the extremities. Implement bed rest and elevation of the affected ex- tremity for the woman with deep vein thrombosis. Theseactions help to reduce interstitial swelling and promotevenous return from that leg. Apply antiembolism stock-ings to both extremities as ordered. Fit the stockings cor-rectly to avoid excess pressure and constriction and urgethe woman to wear them at all times. Sequential compres-sion devices can also be used for women with varicoseveins, a history of thrombophlebitis, or a surgical birth.

After several days of IV heparin therapy, expect to begin oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin (Coumadin)CHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 655 as ordered and monitor coagulation studies. In most cases, the woman will continue to take this medication for severalmonths after discharge. For the woman who develops a pulmonary embolism, institute emergency measures immediately. The objec-tives of treatment are to prevent growth or multiplicationof thrombi in the lower extremities, prevent more thrombifrom traveling to the pulmonary vascular system, and pro-vide cardiopulmonary support if needed. Administer oxy-gen via mask or cannula as ordered and initiate IV heparintherapy titrated according to the results of the coagulationstudies. Maintain the client on bed rest, and administeranalgesics as ordered for pain relief. Be prepared to assistwith administering thrombolytic agents, such as alteplase(tPA), which might be used to dissolve pulmonary emboliand the source of the thrombus in the pelvis or deep legveins, thus reducing the potential for a recurrence. Educating the Client Provide teaching about the use of anticoagulant therapyand danger signs that should be reported (TeachingGuidelines 22.1). Provide anticipatory guidance, sup-port, and education about associated signs of complica-tions and risks. Focus teaching on the following issues: Elimination of modiable risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (smoking, use of oral contraceptives, asedentary lifestyle, and obesity) Importance of using compression stockings Avoidance of constrictive clothing and prolonged stand- ing or sitting in a motionless, leg-dependent position Danger signs and symptoms (sudden onset of chest pain, dyspnea, and tachypnea) to report to the healthcare provider Postpartum Infection Infection during the postpartum period is a common cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Overall, post-partum infection is estimated to occur in up to 8% of allbirths. There is a higher occurrence in cesarean birthsthan in vaginal births (Gilbert & Harmon, 2007). Postpartum infection is dened as a fever of 38 \u00b0C or 100.4 \u00b0F or higher after the rst 24 hours after childbirth, occurring on at least 2 of the rst 10 days after birth,exclusive of the rst 24 hours (Dorland, 2007). Infections can easily enter the female genital tract ex- ternally and ascend through the internal genital structures.In addition, the normal physiologic changes of childbirthincrease the risk of infection by decreasing the vaginal acid-ity due to the presence of amniotic fluid, blood, and lochia,all of which are alkaline. An alkaline environment encour-ages the growth of bacteria. Postpartum infections usually arise from organisms that constitute the normal vaginal flora, typically a mix ofaerobic and anaerobic species. Generally, they are poly-microbial and involve the following Sta- phylococcus trachomatis, and vaginosis (Kennedy,2007). Common postpartum infections include metritis,wound infections, urinary tract infections, and mastitis. METRITIS Although usually referred to clinically as endometritis, postpartum uterine infections typically involve more thanjust the endometrial lining. Metritis is an infectious con- dition that involves the endometrium, decidua, and adja-cent myometrium of the uterus. Extension of metritis canresult in parametritis, which involves the broad ligamentand possibly the ovaries and fallopian tubes, or septicpelvic thrombophlebitis, which results when the infection656 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK spreads along venous routes into the pelvis (Simmons & Bammel, 2007). The uterine cavity is sterile until rupture of the amni- otic sac. As a consequence of labor, birth, and associatedmanipulations, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria can con-taminate the uterus. In most cases, the bacteria responsi-ble for pelvic infections are those that normally reside inthe bowel, vagina, perineum, and cervix, such as E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or G. vaginalis. The risk of metritis increases dramatically after a cesarean birth; it complicates from 10% to 20% of cesareanbirths. This is typically an extension of chorioamnionitisthat was present before birth (indeed, that may havebeen why the cesarean birth was performed). In addition, trauma to the tissues and a break in the skin (incision)provide entrances for bacteria to enter the body and multi-ply (Kennedy, 2007). WOUND INFECTIONS Any break in the skin or mucous membranes provides a portal for bacteria. In the postpartum woman, sites ofwound infection include cesarean surgical incisions, theepisiotomy site in the perineum, and genital tract lacera-tions (Fig. 22.2). Wound infections are usually not identi-ed until the woman has been discharged from the hospitalbecause symptoms may not show up until 24 to 48 hoursafter birth. URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS Urinary tract infections are most commonly caused by bacteria often found in bowel flora, including E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterobacter species. Invasivemanipulation of the urethra (e.g., urinary catheterization),frequent vaginal examinations, and genital trauma increasethe likelihood of a urinary tract infection. MASTITIS A common problem that may occur within the rst 2 weeks postpartum is an inflammation of the breast, termed mas- titis. It can result from any event that creates milk stasis: insufcient drainage of the breast, rapid weaning, over-supply of milk, pressure on the breast from a poorly ttingbra, a blocked duct, missed feedings, and breakdown of thenipple via ssures, cracks, or blisters (Betzold, 2007). Themost common infecting organism is S. aureus, which comes from the breastfeeding infant's mouth or throat (Kennedy,TEACHING GUIDELINES 22.1 Teaching to Prevent Bleeding Related to Anticoagulant Therapy Watch for possible signs of bleeding and notify your health care provider if any occur: Nosebleeds Bleeding from the gums or mouth Black tarry stools Brown \"coffee ground\" vomitus Red to brown speckled mucus from a cough Oozing at incision, episiotomy site, cut, or scrape Pink, red, or brown-tinged urine Bruises, \"black and blue marks\" Increased lochia discharge (from present level) Practice measures to reduce your risk of bleeding: Brush your teeth gently using a soft toothbrush. Use an electric razor for shaving. Avoid activities that could lead to injury, scrapes,bruising, or cuts. Do not use any over-the-counter products con-taining aspirin or aspirin-like derivatives. Avoid consuming alcohol. Inform other health care providers about the useof anticoagulants, especially dentists. Be sure to comply with follow-up laboratory testingas scheduled. If you accidentally cut or scrape yourself, apply rmdirect pressure to the site for 5 to 10 minutes. Dothe same after receiving any injections or havingblood specimens drawn. Wear an identication bracelet or band that indicatesthat you are taking an anticoagulant. 11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 6562007). Infection can be transmitted from the lactiferous ducts to a secreting lobule, from a nipple ssure to periduc-tal lymphatics, or by circulation (Gilbert & Harmon, 2007)(Fig. 22.3). A breast abscess may develop if mastitis is nottreated adequately. Therapeutic Management When metritis occurs, broad-spectrum antibiotics are usedto treat the infection. Management also includes measuresto restore and promote fluid and electrolyte balance, pro-vide analgesia, and provide emotional support. In mosttreated women, fever drops and symptoms cease within 48to 72 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy.CHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 657 Management for wound infections involves recogni- tion of the infection, followed by opening of the wound toallow drainage. Aseptic wound management with sterilegloves and frequent dressing changes if applicable, goodhandwashing, frequent perineal pad changes, hydration,and ambulation to prevent venous stasis and improve cir-culation are initiated to prevent development of a moreserious infection or spread of the infection to adjacentstructures. Parenteral antibiotics are the mainstay of treat-ment. Analgesics are also important, because women oftenexperience discomfort at the wound site. If the woman develops a urinary tract infection, fluids are used to treat dehydration. Antibiotics may be orderedif appropriate. Treatment of mastitis focuses on two areas: emptying the breasts and controlling the infection. The breast canbe emptied either by the infant sucking or by manual ex-pression. Increasing the frequency of nursing is advised.Lactation need not be suppressed. Control of infection isachieved with antibiotics. In addition, ice or warm packsand analgesics may be needed. ABFIGURE22.2 Postpartum wound in- fections. ( A) Infected episiotomy site. ( B) Infected cesarean birth incision. FIGURE22.3 With mastitis, an area on one breast is tender, hot, red, and painful. Regardless of the etiology of mastitis, the focus is on reversing milk stasis, maintain- ing milk supply, and continuing breastfeeding, alongwith providing maternal comfort and preventingrecurrence.Take NOTE! Nursing Assessment Perinatal nurses are the primary caregivers for post-partum women and have a unique opportunity to iden-tify subtle changes that place women at risk for infection.11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 657Nurses play a key role in identifying signs and symptoms that suggest a postpartum infection. Today women arecommonly discharged 24 to 48 hours after giving birth.Therefore, nurses must assess new mothers for risk fac-tors and identify early, subtle signs and symptoms of aninfectious process. Factors that place a woman at riskfor a postpartum infection are highlighted in Box 22.2. Review the client's history and physical examina- tion and labor and birth record for factors that mightincrease her risk for developing an infection. Thencomplete the assessment (using the \"BUBBLE-HE\"parameters discussed in Chapter 16), paying particular attention to areas such as the abdomen and fundus,breasts, urinary tract, episiotomy, lacerations, or inci-sions, being alert for signs and symptoms of infection(Table 22.1).658 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK When assessing the episiotomy site, use the acronym \"REEDA\" (redness, ecchymosis, edema, drainage or dis-charge, and approximation of wound edges) to ensurecomplete evaluation of the site (Arenson & Drake, 2007).Monitor the woman's vital signs, especially her tempera-ture, for changes that may signal an infection. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on preventing postpartuminfections. Use the following guidelines to reduce the in-cidence of postpartum infections: Maintain aseptic technique when performing invasive procedures such as urinary catheterization, whenchanging dressings, and during all surgical procedures. Use good handwashing technique before and after each client care activity. Reinforce measures for maintaining good perineal hygiene. Use adequate lighting and turn the client to side to assess the episiotomy site. Screen all visitors for any signs of active infections to reduce the client's risk of exposure. Review the client's history for preexisting infections or chronic conditions. Monitor vital signs and laboratory results for any abnormal values. Monitor the frequency of vaginal examinations and length of labor. BOX 22.2 Factors Placing a Woman at Risk for Postpartum Infection Prolonged ( >18 to 24 hours) premature rupture of mem- branes (removes the barrier of amniotic fluid so bacteriacan ascend) Cesarean birth (allows bacterial entry due to break in protective skin barrier) Urinary catheterization (could allow entry of bacteria into bladder due to break in aseptic technique) Regional anesthesia that decreases perception to void (causes urinary stasis and increases risk of urinary tractinfection) Staff attending to woman are ill (promotes droplet infec- tion from personnel) Compromised health status, such as anemia, obesity, smoking, drug abuse (reduces the body's immune systemand decreases ability to ght infection) Preexisting colonization of lower genital tract with bacterial vaginosis, Chlamydia trachomatis, group B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli (allows microbes to ascend) Retained placental fragments (provides medium for bacterial growth) Manual removal of a retained placenta (causes trauma to the lining of the uterus and thus opens up sites for bacterial invasion) Insertion of fetal scalp electrode or intrauterine pressure catheters for internal fetal monitoring during labor (provides entry into uterine cavity) Instrument-assisted childbirth, such as forceps or vacuum extraction (increases risk of trauma to genitaltract, which provides bacteria access to grow) Trauma to the genital tract, such as episiotomy or lacerations (provides a portal of entry for bacteria) Prolonged labor with frequent vaginal examinations to check progress (allows time for bacteria to multiply andincreases potential exposure to microorganisms or trauma) Poor nutritional status (reduces body's ability to repair tissue) Gestational diabetes (decreases body's healing ability and provides higher glucose levels on skin and in urine, whichencourages bacterial growth) Break in aseptic technique during surgery or birthing process (allows entry of bacteria) A postpartum infection is commonly associated with an elevated temperature, as mentioned previously. Other generalized signs andsymptoms may include chills, foul-smelling vaginaldischarge, headache, malaise, restlessness, anxiety,and tachycardia. In addition, the woman may havespecic signs and symptoms based on the type andlocation of the infection.Take NOTE! 11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 658 Assess frequently for early signs of infection, especially fever and the appearance of lochia. Inspect wounds frequently for inflammation and drainage. Encourage rest, adequate hydration, and healthy eat- ing habits. Reinforce preventive measures during any interaction with the client. If the woman develops an infection, review treatment measures, such as antibiotic therapy if ordered, and anyspecial care measures, such as dressing changes, that mightbe needed (Nursing Care Plan 22.1). Client teaching is a priority due to today's short lengths of stay after delivery. Some infections may notCHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 659 manifest until after discharge. Review the signs and symp- toms of infection, emphasizing the danger signs that needto be reported to the health care provider. Most impor-tantly, stress proper handwashing, especially after perinealcare and before and after breastfeeding. Also reinforcemeasures to promote breastfeeding, including properbreast care (see Chapter 16). Teaching Guidelines 22.2highlights the major teaching points for a woman with apostpartum infection.

It was a cesarean birth due to cephalopelvic disproportion following 25 hours of labor with ruptured membranes. Her temperature is 102.6 \u00b0F (39.2 \u00b0C). She is complaining of chills and malaise and says, \"My incision really hurts.\" Jennifer rates her pain as 7 to 8 out of 10. The incision site is red, swolle n, and very warm to the touch. A 5-cm area of purulent drainage is noted on the dressing; a 3-cm area of the incision isslightly opened, with the wound edges separated. Jennifer's lochia is scant and dark red, with a strong odor. She asks thenurse to take her baby back to the nursery because she doesn't feel well enough to care for him. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective thermoregulation related to bacterial invasion as evidenced by fever, complaints of chills and malaise, and statement of not feeling well Outcome Identication and Evaluation Jennifer will exhibit a return to normothermia as evidenced by a body temperature being maintained below 99 \u00b0F, reports of a decrease in chills and malaise, and statements of feeling better. Interventions: Promoting Fever Reduction Assess vital signs every 2 to 4 hours and record results to monitor progress of infection. Administer antipyretics as ordered to reduce temperature and help combat infection. Encourage fluid intake to promote fluid balance. Document intake and output to assess hydration status. Offer cool bed bath or shower to reduce temperature. Place cool cloth on forehead and/or back of neck for comfort. Change bed linen and gown when damp from diaphoresis to provide comfort and hygiene. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired skin integrity related to wound infection as evidenced by purulent drainage, redness, swelling, and separation of wound edges Outcome Identication and Evaluation Jennifer will experience a resolution of wound infection as evidenced by a reduction in redness, swelling, and drainage from wound, absence of purulent drainage, and beginning signs and symptoms of wound healing. Interventions: Promoting Wound Healing Administer antibiotic therapy as ordered to treat infection. Perform frequent dressing changes and wound care as ordered to promote wound healing; monitor dressing for drainage, including amount, color, and characteristics, to evaluate for resolution of infection. Use aseptic technique to prevent spread of infection. Encourage fluid intake to maintain fluid balance; encourage adequate dietary intake, including protein, to promote healing. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Acute pain related to infectious process Outcome Identication and Evaluation Client reports a decrease in pain as evidenced by pain rating of 0 or 1 on pain scale; verbalization of relief with pain management, and statements of feeling better and ability to rest comfortably. Interventions: Relieving Pain Place client in semi-Fowler's position to facilitate drainage and relieve pressure. Assess pain level on pain scale of 0 to 10 to quantify pain level; reassess pain level after intervening to determine effectiveness of intervention. Assess fundus gently to ensure appropriate involution. Administer analgesics as needed and on time as ordered to maintain pain relief. Provide for rest periods to allow for healing. Assist with positioning in bed with pillows to promote comfort. Offer nonpharmacologic pain measures such as a backrub to ease aches and discomfort if desired and enhance effectiveness of analgesics.11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 660of a woman and her family. It is an exhilarating time for most women, but for others it may not be what they hadexpected. Women have varied reactions to their child-bearing experiences, exhibiting a wide range of emotions.Typically, the delivery of a newborn is associated withpositive feelings such as happiness, joy, and gratitude forthe birth of a healthy infant. However, women may alsofeel weepy, overwhelmed, or unsure of what is happeningto them. They may experience fear about loss of control;they may feel scared, alone, or guilty, or as if they havesomehow failed. Postpartum affective disorders have been documented for years, but only recently have they received medicalattention. Plummeting levels of estrogen and progesteroneimmediately after birth can contribute to postpartum mooddisorders. It is believed that the greater the change in thesehormone levels between pregnancy and postpartum, thegreater the chance for developing a mood disorder (Edler,Jones, & Venis, 2007). Many types of affective disorders occur in the post- partum period. Although their description and classica-tion may be controversial, the disorders are commonlyclassied on the basis of their severity as postpartum or babyblues, postpartum depression, and postpartum psychosis. POSTPARTUM OR BABY BLUES Many postpartum women (approximately 50% to 90%) experience the \"baby blues\" (ACOG, 2007). The womanCHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 661 NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for impaired parent-infant attachment related to effects of postpartum infection as evidenced by mother's request to take baby back to the nursery Outcome Identication and Evaluation Jennifer begins to bond with newborn appropriately with each exposure as evidenced by desire to spend time with newborn, expression of positive feelings toward newborn when holding him, increasing participation in care of newborn as client'scondition improves, and statements about help and support at home to care for self and newborn. Interventions: Promoting Mother-Newborn Interaction Promote adequate rest and sleep to ensure adequate energy for interaction and wound healing. Bring newborn to mother after she is rested and had an analgesic to allow mother to focus her energies on the child. Progressively allow the client to care for her infant or comfort him as her energy level and pain level improve to promote self-condence in caring for the newborn. Offer praise and positive reinforcement for caretaking tasks; stress positive attributes of newborn to mother while caringfor him to facilitate bonding and attachment. Contact family members to participate in care of the newborn to allow mother to rest and recover from infection. Encourage mother to care for herself rst and then the newborn to ensure adequate energy for newborn's care. Arrange for assistance and support after discharge from hospital to provide necessary backup. Refer to community health nurse for follow-up care of mother and newborn at home to foster continued development of maternal-infant relationship.Nursing Care Plan 22.1 (continued) exhibits mild depressive symptoms of anxiety, irritability,mood swings, tearfulness, increased sensitivity, feelings ofbeing overwhelmed, and fatigue (Edler, Jones, & Venis,2007). The \"blues\" typically peak on postpartum days 4and 5 and usually resolve by postpartum day 10. Althoughthe woman's symptoms may be distressing, they do notreflect psychopathology and usually do not affect themother's ability to function and care for her infant. Baby blues are usually self-limiting and require no for- mal treatment other than reassurance and validation of thewoman's experience, as well as assistance in caring for her-self and the newborn. However, follow-up of women withpostpartum blues is important, because up to 20% go onto develop postpartum depression (Alexander et al., 2007). POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION Depression is more prevalent in women than in men, which may be related to biological, hormonal, and psycho-social factors. If the symptoms of postpartum blues last be-yond 6 weeks and seem to get worse, the mother may beexperiencing postpartum depression , a major depres- sive episode associated childbirth (Edler, Jones, &Venis, 2007). As many as 20% of all mothers develop post-partum depression (ACOG, 2007). It affects approxi-mately 500,000 mothers in the United States each year,and about half of these women receive no mental healthevaluation or treatment (ACOG, 2007). Unlike the post-partum blues, women with postpartum depression feel11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 661worse over time, and changes in mood and behavior do not go away on their own. Postpartum depression affects not only the woman but also the entire family. Identifying depression earlycan substantially improve the client and family outcomes.Postpartum depression usually has a more gradual onsetand becomes evident within the rst 6 weeks postpartum. Postpartum depression may lend itself to prophylactic intervention because its onset is predictable, the risk periodfor illness is well dened, and women at high risk poten-tially could be identied using a screening tool. This isnot the case for all women, however (see Evidence-Based662 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK Practice 22.1). Prophylaxis starts with a prenatal risk assessment and education. Based on the woman's his-tory of prior depression, prophylactic antidepressanttherapy may be needed during the third trimester orimmediately after giving birth. Management mirrorsthat of any major depression\u2014a combination of anti-depressant medication, antianxiety medication, andpsycho therapy in an outpatient or inpatient setting (Jung et al., 2007). Marital counseling may be necessary if marital problems are contributing to the woman's de- pressive symptoms. POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS At the severe end the continuum of postpartum emo- tional disorders is postpartum psychosis, which occurs inone or two women per 1,000 births (Edler, Jones, & Venis,2007). It generally surfaces within 3 weeks of giving birthand is manifested by sleep disturbances, fatigue, depres-sion, and hypomania. The mother will be tearful, confused,and preoccupied with feelings of guilt and worthlessness.Early symptoms resemble those of depression, but theymay escalate to delirium, hallucinations, anger toward her-TEACHING GUIDELINES 22.2 Teaching for the Woman With a Postpartum Infection Continue your antibiotic therapy as prescribed. Take the medication exactly as ordered and con- tinue with the medication until it is nished. Do not stop taking the medication even when youare feeling better. Check your temperature every day and call yourhealth care provider if it is above 100.4 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Watch for other signs and symptoms of infection, such as chills, increased abdominal pain, change inthe color or odor of your lochia, or increased red-ness, warmth, swelling, or drainage from a woundsite such as your cesarean incision or episiotomy.Report any of these to your health care providerimmediately. Practice good infection prevention: Always wash your hands thoroughly before andafter eating, using the bathroom, touching your perineal area, or providing care for your newborn. Wipe from front to back after using the bathroom. Remove your perineal pad using a front-to-backmotion. Fold the pad in half so that the inner sidesof the pad that were touching your body areagainst each other. Wrap in toilet tissue or place ina plastic bag and discard. Wash your hands before applying a new pad. Apply a new perineal pad using a front-to-backmotion. Handle the pad by the edges (top andbottom or sides) and avoid touching the inner aspect of the pad that will be against your body. When performing perineal care with the peri- bottle, a ngle the spray of water to that it flows from front to back. Drink plenty of fluids each day and eat a variety offoods that are high in vitamins, iron, and protein. Be sure to get adequate rest at night and periodi-cally throughout the day.Consider THIS! As an assertive practicing attorney in her thirties, myrst pregnancy was lled with nagging feelings of doubtabout this upcoming event in my life. Throughout mypregnancy I was so busy with trial work that I neverhad time to really evaluate my feelings. I was alwaysreading about the bodily changes that were taking place,and on one level I was feeling excited, but on anotherlevel I was emotionally drained. Shortly after the birthof my daughter, those suppressed nagging feelings ofdoubt surfaced big time and practically immobilizedme. I felt exhausted all the time and was only too gladto have someone else care for my daughter. I didn'tbreastfeed because I thought it would tie me down toomuch. Although at the time I thought this \"low mood\"was normal for all new mothers, I have since found outit was postpartum depression. How could any womanbe depressed about this wondrous event? Thoughts: Now that postpartum depression has been \"taken out of the closet\" and recognized as a realemotional disorder, it can be treated. This womanshowed tendencies during her pregnancy but was ableto suppress the feelings and go forward. Her descriptionof her depression is very typical of many women whosuffer in silence, hoping to get over these feelings intime. What can nurses do to promote awareness of thisdisorder? Can it be prevented? 11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 662self and her infant, bizarre behavior, manifestations of mania, and thoughts of hurting herself and the infant. Themother frequently loses touch with reality and experiencesa severe regressive breakdown, associated with a high riskof suicide or infanticide (Johnson, 2007). Most women with postpartum psychosis are hospi- talized for up to several months. Psychotropic drugs arealmost always part of treatment, along with individualpsychotherapy and support group therapy.CHAPTER 22 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE POSTPARTUM WOMAN AT RISK 663 Nursing Assessment Postpartum affective disorders are often overlooked and go unrecognized despite the large percentage of womenwho experience them. The postpartum period is a time ofincreased vulnerability, but few women receive educationabout the possibility of depression after birth. In addition,many women may feel ashamed of having negative emo-tions at a time when they \"should\" be happy; thus, theydon't seek professional help. Nurses can play a major rolein providing guidance about postpartum affective dis-orders, detecting manifestations, and assisting women toobtain appropriate care. Begin the assessment by reviewing the history to iden- tify general risk factors that could predispose a woman todepression: Poor coping skills Low self-esteem Numerous life stressorsDennis, C.-L., & Creedy, D. (2004). Psychosocial and psychological interventions for preventing postpartum depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2004, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD001134. DOI:10.1002/14651858.CD001134.pub2.Study Postpartum depression can be a devastating condition for women and their families. There is a lack of knowledgeabout its cause, and women receive limited educationabout the possibility of depression after birth. Researchhas shown the effectiveness of treatment strategies thatintegrate psychosocial and psychological variables. Thequestion then arises that if management addressing thesevariables is effective, would psychosocial interventionsprovided during pregnancy and the early postpartum periodbe effective in preventing postpartum depression? Two reviewers searched multiple databases and con- tacted experts in the eld. They also scanned secondary references and contacted several trial researchers for additional information. Both reviewers were involved inevaluating the methodology of the study and in extractingdata. Information was gathered from all published and unpublished randomized controlled trials that comparedpsychosocial or psychological interventions with typicalcare during the antepartal, intrapartal, and postpartal periods. The researchers used relative risk for categoricaldata and weighted mean difference for continuous data.The study included 15 trials involving over 7,600 women. Findings Women who received some type of psychosocial inter-vention had the same risk for developing postpartum depression as the women who received routine care; thus, the psychosocial intervention was not effective inpreventing postpartum depression. However, statisticalanalysis found that intensive psychosocial support frompublic health nurses or midwives in the postpartum periodwas beneficial. The use of psychosocial interventions primarily during the postpartum period also was more effective than when these interventions were also used inthe prenatal period. Interventions focusing on women atrisk appear to be more effective than those geared to theoverall maternal population. Individualized interventionswere found to be more effective than those designed forgroups. However, the risk for developing postpartum depression for either group did not differ signicantly. Nursing Implications Although the study failed to identify effective measures for preventing postpartum depression, it did provide someuseful information for nurses to incorporate when providingcare to pregnant women throughout the perinatal period.Nurses need to remain alert for risk factors associated withpostpartum depression so they can initiate appropriate interventions for these at-risk women. Nurses can implementpsychosocial interventions during the prenatal period,keeping in mind that these interventions need to be contin ued throughout the postpartum period. They can also advocate for their clients upon discharge to ensureappropriate follow-up and support in the community. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 22.1 Preventing Postpartum Depression Using Psychosocial Interventions The greatest hazard of postpartum psychosis is suicide. Infanticide and child abuse are also risks if the woman is left alone with her infant.Early recognition and prompt treatment of this disorderare imperative.Take NOTE! 11223-22_CH22.qxd 8/4/08 3:05 PM Page 663 Mood swings and emotional stress Previous psychological problems or a family history of psychiatric disorders Substance abuse Limited or lack of social support network Also review the history for specic pregnancy and birth factors that may increase the woman's risk for de-pression. These may include a history of postpartum de-pression, evidence of depression during the pregnancy,prenatal anxiety, a difcult or complicated pregnancy,traumatic birth experience, or birth of a high-risk orspecial-needs infant (Johnson, 2007). Be alert for physical ndings. Assess the woman's activity level, including her level of fatigue. Ask about hersleeping habits, noting any problems with insomnia. Wheninteracting with the woman, observe for verbal and non-verbal indicators of anxiety as well as her ability to con-centrate during the interaction. Difculty concentratingand anxious behaviors suggest a problem. Also assess hernutritional intake: weight loss due to poor food intake maybe seen. Assessment can identify women with a high-riskprole for depression, and the nurse can educate themand make referrals for individual or family counseling ifneeded. Some common assessment ndings associatedwith postpartum depression are listed in Box 22.3. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on assisting any postpartumwoman to cope with the changes of this period. Encouragethe client to verbalize what she is going through and em-phasize the importance of keeping her expectations realis-tic. Assist the woman in structuring her day to regain asense of control over the situation. Encourage her to seek664 UNIT SEVEN CHILDBEARING AT RISK help if necessary, using available support systems. Also re- inforce the need for good nutrition and adequate exerciseand sleep (Linter & Gray, 2006). The nurse can play an important role in assisting women and their partners with postpartum adjustment.Providing facts about the enormous changes that occurduring the postpartum period is critical. This informationwould include changes in the woman's body. Review thesigns and symptoms of all three affective disorders. Thisinformation is typically included as part of prenatal visitsand childbirth education classes. Know the risk factorsassociated with these disorders and review the history ofclients and their families. Use specic, nonthreateningquestions to aid in early detection, such as, \"Have youfelt down, depressed, or hopeless lately? Have you felt lit-tle interest or pleasure in doing things recently?\" Discuss factors that may increase a woman's vulnera- bility to stress during the postpartum period, such as sleepdeprivation and unrealistic expectations, so couples canunderstand and respond to those problems if they occur.Stress that many women need help after childbirth and thathelp is available from many sources, including people theyalready know. Assisting women to learn how to ask for helpis important so they can gain the support they need. Alsoprovide educational materials about postpartum emotionaldisorders. Have available referral sources for psychotherapyand support groups appropriate for women experiencingpostpartum adjustment difculties. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Postpartum hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening complication of both vaginal and cesarean births.

Gestational age at birth isinversely correlated with the risk that the infant will expe-rience physical, neurologic, or developmental sequelae(March of Dimes, 2007b, 2007c). Some newborns areborn very ill and need special advanced care to survive. When a woman gives birth to a newborn with prob- lems involving immaturity or birthweight, especially onewho is considered high risk, she may go through a grievingprocess in which she mourns the loss of the healthy full-term newborn she had expected. Through this process shelearns to come to terms with the experience she now faces. The development of new technologies and regional- ized care centers for the care of newborns with specialneeds has resulted in signicant improvements. Nursesneed to have a sound knowledge base to identify the new-born with special needs and to provide coordinated care. The key to identifying a newborn with special needs related to birthweight or gestational age variation is anawareness of the factors that could place a newborn atrisk. These factors are similar to those that would suggesta high-risk pregnancy and include: Maternal nutrition (malnutrition or overweight) Substandard living conditions Low socioeconomic status Maternal age of less than 20 or more than 35 years old Substance abuse Failure to seek prenatal care Smoking or exposure to passive smoke Periodontal disease Multiple gestation Extreme maternal stress Abuse and violence Placental complications (placenta previa or abruptio placentae) History of previous preterm birth Maternal disease (e.g., hypertension or diabetes) Maternal infection (e.g., urinary tract infection or chorioamnionitis) Exposure to occupational hazards (Gilbert, 2007) Being able to anticipate the birth of a newborn at risk allows the birth to take place at a health care facilityequipped with the resources to meet the mother's andnewborn's needs. This is important in reducing mortal-ity and morbidity. Healthy People 2010 identies preterm births and low birthweight as important national health goals (U.S. De-partment of Health and Human Services [USDHHS],2000). This chapter discusses the nursing management of newborns with special needs related to variations in birth-672 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK weight and gestational age. It also describes selected as- sociated conditions affecting these newborns. Due to thefrailty of these newborns, the care of the family experienc-ing perinatal loss and the role of the nurse in helping thefamily cope also are addressed. Birthweight Variations Fetal growth is influenced by maternal nutrition, genet-ics, placental function, environment, and a multitude ofother factors. Assigning size to a newborn is a way tomeasure and monitor the growth and development of thenewborn at birth. Newborns can be classied accordingto their weight and weeks of gestation, and knowing thegroup into which a newborn ts is important. Appropriate for gestational age (AGA) charac- terizes approximately 80% of newborns and describes anewborn with a normal height, weight, head circumfer-ence, and body mass index (BMI; Dorland, 2007). Beingin the AGA group confers the lowest risk for any prob-lems. These infants have lower morbidity and mortalitythan other groups.

A newborn is also classi- ed as SGA if his or her birthweight is at or below the10th percentile as correlated with the number of weeks ofgestation on a growth chart. Large-for-gestational-age (LGA) describes new- borns whose birthweight is above the 90th percentile on agrowth chart and who weigh more than 4,000 g (8 lb 13 oz)at term due to accelerated growth for length of gestation(Herranz et al., 2007). The following terms describe other newborns with marginal weights at birth and of any gestational age: Low birthweight : less than 2,500 g (5.5 lb) (Fig. 23.1) Very low birthweight : less than 1,500 g (3 lb 5 oz) Extremely low birthweight : less than 1,000 g (2 lb 3 oz) SMALL-FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE NEWBORNS Newborns are considered SGA when they weigh less than two standard deviations for gestational age or fall belowthe 10th percentile on a growth chart for gestational age.These infants can be preterm, term, or postterm. In some SGA newborns, the rate of growth does not meet the expected growth pattern. Termed intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), these newborns alsoare considered at risk, with the perinatal morbidity andmortality rate increased substantially compared to thatof the appropriate-for-age newborn (Cunningham et al.,2005). IUGR is the pathologic counterpart of SGA.However, an important distinction to make betweenSGA and IUGR newborns is that not all who are SGAhave IUGR. The converse also is true: not all are SGA. Some SGA newborns are con-stitutionally small: they are statistically small but other-wise healthy.CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 673 Conditions altering fetal growth produce insults that affect all organ systems and are known to produce two pat-terns of growth that depend on the timing of the insult tothe developing embryo or fetus. An early insult (typicallyoccurring before 28 weeks) results in overall growth restric-tion, with all organs being small. These SGA infants nevercatch up in size when compared with normal children. Aninsult later in gestation (after 28 weeks) results in intrauter-ine malnutrition, but optimal postnatal nutrition generallyrestores normal growth potential and carries a better prog-nosis than earlier insults (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Historically, IUGR has been categorized as symmet- ric or asymmetric. Symmetric IUGR refers to fetuses withequally poor growth rates of the head, the abdomen, andthe long bones. Asymmetric IUGR refers to infants whosehead and long bones are spared compared to their ab-domen and internal organs. The current belief is that inmost cases IUGR is a continuum from asymmetry (earlystages) to symmetry (late stages) (Harper & Lam, 2007). Fetal growth is dependent on genetic, placental, and maternal factors. Cognitive and motor development duringinfancy forms the basis for children's subsequent develop-ment. Newborns who experience nutritional deciencies inutero and are born SGA are at risk for cognitive decits thatcan undermine their academic performance throughouttheir lives (Kristensen et al., 2007). The fetus is thought to have an inherent growth po- tential that, under normal circumstances, yields a healthynewborn of appropriate size. The maternal-placental-fetalunits act in harmony to meet the needs of the fetus duringgestation. However, growth potential in the fetus can belimited, and this is analogous to failure to thrive in the in-fant. The causes of both can be intrinsic or environmental.Factors that can contribute to the birth of an SGA new-born are highlighted in Box 23.1. Nursing Assessment Assessment of the SGA infant begins by reviewing the ma-ternal history to identify risk factors such as smoking, drugabuse, chronic maternal illness, hypertension, multiplegestation, or genetic disorders. This information allowsthe nurse to anticipate a possible problem and to be pre-pared to intervene quickly should one occur. At birth, per-form a thorough physical examination, closely observingthe newborn for typical characteristics, including: Head disproportionately large compared to rest of body Wasted appearance of extremities Reduced subcutaneous fat stores Decreased amount of breast tissue Scaphoid abdomen (sunken appearance) Wide skull sutures secondary to inadequate bone growth Poor muscle tone over buttocks and cheeks Loose and dry skin that appears oversized Thin umbilical cord FIGURE23.1 A low birthweight newborn in an isolette.11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 673Also the SGA newborn for any congenital mal- formations, neurologic insults, or indications of infection.SGA newborns commonly face problems after birth be-cause of the decrease in placental function during gesta-tion. Table 23.1 highlights some of the common problemsassociated with SGA newborns and others experiencing avariation in birthweight or gestational age. Anticipate theneed for and provide resuscitation as indicated by thenewborn's condition. Nursing Management Interventions for the SGA infant may include obtainingweight, length, and head circumference, comparing themto standards, and documenting the ndings. Perform fre-quent serial blood glucose measurements as ordered andmonitor vital signs, being particularly alert for changes inrespiratory status that might indicate respiratory distress.Institute measures to maintain a neutral thermal environ-ment to prevent cold stress and acidosis. Initiate early and frequent oral feedings unless con- traindicated. At birth the newborn's glucose level 70%of the mother's serum glucose (Aylott, 2006a). Any new-born stressed at birth uses up available glucose storeswith resulting hypoglycemia, a plasma glucose concentra-tion at or below 40 mg/dL (Stanley, 2006). With the lossof the placenta at birth, the newborn now must assumecontrol of glucose homeostasis through intermittent oralfeedings. If oral feedings are not accepted, an intravenousinfusion with 10% dextrose in water may be needed tomaintain the glucose level above 40 mg/dL. Weigh thenewborn daily and ensure that he or she has adequate restperiods to decrease metabolic requirements. Observe for clinical signs of polycythemia and mon- itor blood results. Asymptomatic newborns with a ocrit between 60% and 70% may simply be supportedwith fluids, close observation, and a repeat hematocrit674 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK level in 4 to 6 hours (Kates & Kates, 2007). If the new- born is symptomatic, partial exchange transfusion may beused, but this treatment is considered controversial. Provide anticipatory guidance to parents about any treatments and procedures that are being done. Empha-size the need for close follow-up and careful monitoringof the infant's growth in length, weight, and head circum-ference and feeding patterns throughout the rst year oflife to conrm any \"catch-up\" growth taking place. LARGE-FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE NEWBORNS A newborn whose weight is above the 90th percentile on growth charts or two standard deviations above the meanweight for gestational age is dened as LGA. The rangeof weight is 4,000 to 5,000 g, or more than 9 lb. LGA in-fants may be preterm, term, or postterm. Based on thesedenitions, up to 10% of all births involve an LGA new-born (March of Dimes, 2007a). Because of the newborn's large size, vaginal birth may be difcult and occasionally results in birth injury.In addition, shoulder dystocia, clavicular fractures, andfacial palsies are common. The incidence of cesareanbirths is very high with LGA newborns to avoid arrestedlabor and birth trauma.Sources: Harper & Lam, 2007; Kenner & Lott, 2007; and Neonatal Handbook, 2007eBOX 23.1 Factors Contributing to the Birth of SGA Newborns Maternal causes Chronic hypertension Diabetes mellitus with vascular disease Autoimmune diseases Living at a high altitude (hypoxia) Smoking Substance abuse (heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines) Hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell anemia) Preeclampsia Chronic renal disease Malnutrition TORCH group infections Placental factors Abnormal cord insertion Chronic abruption Decreased previa insufciency Fetal factors Trisomy 13, fetal Radiation exposure Multiple gestation Diabetes is commonly associated with LGA newborns.

(continued)11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 677Nursing Assessment Assessment of the LGA newborn begins with a review of the maternal history, which can provide clues as to whetherthe woman has an increased risk of giving birth to an LGAnewborn. Maternal factors that increase the chance ofbearing an LGA newborn include maternal diabetes mel-litus or glucose intolerance, multiparity, prior history of amacrosomic infant, postdates gestation, maternal obesity,male fetus, and genetics (Jazayeri, 2007). At birth, assess the newborn for common character- istics. The typical LGA newborn has a large body and ap-pears plump and full-faced. The increase in body size isproportional. However, the head circumference and bodylength are in the upper limits of intrauterine growth.These newborns have poor motor skills and have difcultyin regulating behavioral states. LGA newborns are moredifcult to arouse to a quiet alert state (Neonatal Hand-book, 2007f). Thoroughly assess the LGA newborn at birth to identify traumatic birth injuries such as fractured clavi-cles, brachial palsy, facial paralysis, phrenic nerve palsy,678 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK skull fractures, or hematomas. Perform a neurologic ex- amination to identify any nerve palsies, looking for ab-normalities such as immobility of the upper arm. Observeand document any injuries discovered to allow for earlyintervention and improved outcomes. Obtain frequent blood glucose levels as ordered to evaluate for hypoglycemia. The clinical signs are oftensubtle and include lethargy, apathy, drowsiness, irritability,tachypnea, weak cry, temperature instability, jitteriness,seizures, apnea, bradycardia, cyanosis or pallor, feeble suckand poor feeding, hypotonia, and coma. Other disorders,including septicemia, severe respiratory distress, and con-genital heart disease, may present with similar ndings. Inaddition, be alert for other common problems, such aspolycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia (see Table 23.1 ear-lier in this chapter). Nursing Management Assist in stabilizing the LGA newborn.

To help prevent hypoglycemia, initiatefeedings, which can be formula or breast milk, with intra-venous glucose supplementation as needed. If the newborn's blood glucose level is below 25 mg/dL, institute immediate treatment with intravenous glucose, re-gardless of clinical symptoms (Aylott, 2006a). Monitor andrecord intake and output and obtain daily weights to aid inevaluating nutritional intake. Observe for signs of polycythemia and hyperbiliru- binemia and report any immediately to the health careprovider so that early interventions can be taken to pre-vent poor long-term neurologic development outcomes.Polycythemia and hyperviscosity are associated with neand gross motor delays, speech delays, and neurologicsequelae (Neonatal Handbook, 2007g). Increasing fluidvolume aids in decreasing blood viscosity. Partial ex-change transfusion with plasma or normal saline may beused to lower hematocrit and decrease blood viscosity,but this treatment remains controversial. Hydration, earlyfeedings, and phototherapy are used to treat hyperbili-rubinemia (see Chapter 24 for more information abouthyperbilirubinemia). Provide parental guidance about thetreatments and procedures being done and about the needfor follow-up care for any abnormalities identied. Gestational Age Variations The mean duration of pregnancy, calculated from therst day of the last normal menstrual period, is approxi-mately 280 days, or 40 weeks. Gestational age is typicallymeasured in weeks: a newborn born before completion of37 weeks is classied as a preterm newborn and one born after completion of 42 weeks is classied as a post- term newborn . An infant born from the rst day of 38th week through 42 weeks is classied as a term newborn . As of 2006, a new classication has been added, the late preterm newborn \u2014one who is born between 34 weeks and 36 weeks, 6 days of gestation. Precise knowledge of a newborn's gestational age is imperative for effective postnatal management. Determi-nation of gestational age by the nurse assists in planningappropriate care for the newborn and provides importantinformation regarding potential problems that need inter-ventions. See Chapter 18 for more information on assess-ing gestational age.CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 679 POSTTERM NEWBORN A pregnancy that extends beyond 42 weeks' gestation pro- duces a postterm newborn. Other terms used to describethese late births include postmature, prolonged preg-nancy, or postdates pregnancy. Postterm newborns maybe LGA, SGA, or dysmature (newborn weighs less thanestablished normal parameters for estimated gestationalage [IUGR]), depending on placental function. The reason why some pregnancies last longer than others is not completely understood. What is known isthat women who experience one postterm pregnancyare at increased risk in subsequent pregnancies. The in-cidence of prolonged pregnancy is approximately 10%(Gilbert, 2007). The ability of the placenta to provide adequate oxy- gen and nutrients to the fetus after 42 weeks' gestationis thought to be compromised, leading to perinatal mor-tality and morbidity. As the placenta loses its ability tonourish the fetus, the fetus uses stored nutrients to stayalive, and wasting occurs. This wasted appearance atbirth is secondary to the loss of muscle mass and sub-cutaneous fat. Consider THIS! I had been waiting for this baby my whole married lifeand now I was told to wait even longer. I was into mythird week past my due date and was just told that if Ididn't go into labor on my own, the doctor would in-duce me on Monday. As I waddled out of his ofceinto the hot summer sun, I thought about all the com-ments that would await me at the ofce: \"You're notstill pregnant, are you?\" \"Weren't you house.\" \"Are you sureyou aren't expecting triplets?\" I started to get into mycar when I felt warm fluid slide down my legs. Al-though I was embarrassed at my wetness, I wasthrilled I wouldn't have to go back to the ofce anddrove myself to the hospital. Within hours my waitwas nally over with the birth of my son, a postterminfant with peeling skin and a thick head of hair. Hewas certainly worth the wait! Thoughts: Although most due dates are within plus or minus 2 weeks, we can't \"go to the bank with it\"because so many factors influence the start of labor.This woman was anxious about her overdue status,but nature prevailed. The old adage \"when the fruit isripe, it will fall\" doesn't always bring a good outcome:many women need a little push to bring a healthynewborn forth. What happens when the fetus stays in-side the uterus too long? What other features are typi-cal of postterm infants? Although preterm and postterm newborns may appear to be at opposite ends of the ges- tational age spectrum and are very different in size andappearance, both are at high risk and need special care.Take NOTE! 11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 679Nursing Assessment A thorough assessment of the postterm newborn upon admission to the nursery provides a baseline from whichto identify changes in clinical status. Review the mater-nal history for any risk factors associated with posttermbirth. Also be aware of the common physical character-istics and be able to identify any deviation from the ex-pected. Postterm newborns typically exhibit the followingcharacteristics: Dry, cracked, wrinkled skin Long, thin extremities Creases that cover the entire soles of the feet Wide-eyed, alert expression Abundant hair on scalp Thin umbilical cord Limited vernix and lanugo Meconium-stained skin Long nails (Kenner & Lott, 2007) Assess the newborn's gestational age and complete a physical examination to identify any abnormalities. Re-view the medical record to determine the color of the am-niotic fluid when membranes ruptured and observe for ameconium-stained umbilical cord and ngernails to as-sess for possible meconium aspiration. Careful suctioningat the time of birth and afterwards, if the condition dic-tates it, reduces the incidence of meconium aspiration.Also be alert for other typical complications associatedwith a postterm newborn, such as perinatal asphyxia,hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and polycythemia, and beprepared to initiate early interventions (see Table 23.1earlier in the chapter). Nursing Management The birth of a postterm newborn creates a crisis for themother and her family. In most situations, birth of a new-born requiring special care was not anticipated. Posttermnewborns are susceptible to several birth challenges sec-ondary to placental dysfunction that place them at riskfor asphyxia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory distress. Thenurse must be vigilant for complications when managingthese newborns. The postterm newborn is at high risk for perinatal as- phyxia, which is usually attributed to placental deprivationor oligohydramnios that leads to cord compression, therebyreducing perfusion to the fetus. Anticipating the need fornewborn resuscitation is a priority. The newborn resuscita-tion team needs to be available in the birthing suite for im-mediate backup. The newborn may require transport to theneonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for continuous assess-ment, monitoring, and treatment, depending on his or herstatus after resuscitation. Monitor and maintain the postterm newborn's blood glucose levels once stabilized. Intravenous dextrose 10%and/or early initiation of feedings will help stabilize the680 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK blood glucose levels to prevent central nervous system sequelae. Also monitor the postterm newborn's skin tempera- ture, respiration results gases (ABGs) and serum bilirubinlevels, and neurologic status. Institute measures to pre-vent or reduce the risk of hypothermia by eliminatingsources of heat loss: thoroughly dry the newborn at birth,wrap him or her in a warmed blanket, and place a stock-inet cap on the newborn's head. Providing environmen-tal warmth via a radiant heat source will help stabilize thenewborn's temperature. Closely assess all postterm newborns for polycythe- mia. Providing adequate hydration helps to reduce the vis-cosity of the newborn's blood to prevent thrombosis. Bealert to the early, often subtle signs to promote early iden-tification and prompt treatment to prevent any neuro-developmental delays. PRETERM NEWBORN A preterm newborn is one who is born before the com- pletion of 37 weeks of gestation. Although the nationalbirth rate has been declining since the 1990s, the pretermbirth rate has been climbing rapidly. Approximately onein eight babies, or 12%, is born before the 37th week ofgestation (March of Dimes, 2007c). Prematurity is nowthe leading cause of death within the rst month of lifeand the second leading cause of all infant deaths. The etiology of half of all preterm births is unknown (March of Dimes, 2007b, 2007c). Preterm births take anenormous nancial toll, estimated to be in the billions ofdollars. They also take an emotional toll on those involved. Changes in perinatal care practices, including regional care, have reduced newborn mortality rates. Transportinghigh-risk pregnant women to a tertiary center for birthrather than transferring the neonate after birth is asso-ciated with a reduction in neonatal mortality and morbid-ity (Vargo & Trotter, 2007). Despite increasing survivalrates, preterm infants continue to be at high risk forneurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy ormental retardation, intraventricular hemorrhage, con-genital anomalies, lung disease (Kipiani, Tatishvili, &Sirbiladze, 2007). Making sure that all pregnant womenreceive quality prenatal care throughout pregnancy is amajor method for preventing preterm births. Effects of Prematurity on Body Systems Since the preterm newborn did not remain in utero longenough, every body system may be immature, affectingthe newborn's transition from intrauterine to extrauter-ine life and placing him or her at risk for complications.11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 680Without full development, organ systems are not capable of functioning at the level needed to maintain extrauter-ine homeostasis (March of Dimes, 2007b, 2007c). Recall Anna, who was described at the beginning of the chapter; she gave birth to a newborn at 7 months' gestation.What problems would you anticipate that her newbornmight have? Respiratory System The respiratory system is one of the last body systems tomature. Therefore, the preterm newborn is at great riskfor respiratory complications. A few of the problems thataffect the preterm newborn's breathing ability and adjust-ment to extrauterine life include: Surfactant deciency, leading to the development of respiratory distress syndrome Unstable chest wall, leading to atelectasis Immature respiratory control centers, leading to apnea Smaller respiratory passages, leading to an increased risk for obstruction Inability to clear fluid from passages, leading to transient tachypnea Cardiovascular System The preterm newborn has great difculty in making thetransition from intrauterine to extrauterine life in terms ofchanging from a fetal to a newborn circulation pattern.Higher oxygen levels in the circulation once air breathingbegins spur this transition. If the oxygen levels remain lowsecondary to perinatal asphyxia, the fetal pattern of circu-lation may persist, causing blood flow to bypass the lungs.Another problem affecting the cardiovascular system is theincreased incidence of congenital anomalies associatedwith continued fetal circulation\u2014patent an open foramen ovale. In addition, impaired regula-tion of blood pressure in preterm newborns may causefluctuations throughout the circulatory system. One ofspecial note is cerebral blood flow, which may predisposethe fragile blood vessels in the brain to rupture, causingintracranial hemorrhage (Lissauer & Weindling, 2006). Gastrointestinal System Preterm newborns usually lack the neuromuscular co-ordination required to maintain the suck, swallow, andbreathing regimen necessary for sufcient calorie andfluid intake to support growth. Perinatal hypoxia causesshunting of blood from the gut to more important organssuch as the heart and brain. Subsequently, ischemia anddamage to the intestinal wall can occur. This combina-tion of shunting, ischemia, damage to the intestinal wall,and poor sucking ability places the preterm infant at riskfor malnutrition and weight loss.CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 681 In addition, preterm newborns have a small stomach capacity, weak abdominal muscles, compromised meta-bolic function, limited ability to digest proteins and ab-sorb nutrients, and weak or absent suck and gag reflexes.All of these limitations place the preterm newborn at riskfor nutritional deficiency and subsequent growth anddevelopment delays (Neonatal Handbook, 2007h). Currently, minimal enteral feeding is used to prepare the preterm newborn's gut to overcome the many feedingdifculties associated with gastrointestinal immaturity. Itinvolves the introduction of small amounts, usually 0.5 to1 mL/kg/h, of enteral feeding to induce surges in guthormones that enhance maturation of the intestine. Thisminute amount of breast milk or formula given via gavagefeeding prepares the gut to absorb future introduction ofnutrients. It builds mucosal bulk, stimulates develop-ment of enzymes, enhances pancreatic function, stimulatesmaturation gastrointestinal hormones, reduces gastro-intestinal distention and malabsorption, and enhancestransition to oral feedings (Blackburn, 2007). Renal System The renal system of the preterm newborn is immature, re-ducing the baby's ability to concentrate urine and slowingthe glomerular ltration rate. As a result, the risk for fluidretention, with subsequent fluid and electrolyte distur-bances, increases. In addition, preterm newborns havelimited ability to clear drugs from their systems, thereby in-creasing the risk of drug toxicity. Close monitoring of thepreterm newborn's acid-base and electrolyte balance is crit-ical to identify metabolic inconsistencies. Prescribed med-ications require strict evaluation to prevent overwhelmingthe preterm baby's immature renal system. Immune System The preterm newborn's immune system is very immature,increasing his or her susceptibility to infections. A de-ciency of IgG may occur because transplacental transferdoes not occur until after 34 weeks' gestation. This pro-tection is lacking if the baby was born before this time. Inaddition, preterm newborns have an impaired ability tomanufacture antibodies to ght infection if they were ex-posed to pathogens during the birth process. Moreover,the preterm newborn's thin skin and fragile blood vesselsprovide a limited protective barrier, adding to the in-creased risk for infection. Thus, anticipating and prevent-ing infections is the goal; preventing infections has a betteroutcome than treating them. Central Nervous System The preterm newborn is susceptible to injury and insult tothe central nervous system (CNS), increasing the poten-tial for long-term disability into adulthood. Like all new-borns, preterm newborns have difculty in temperatureregulation and maintaining stability. However, their riskfor heat loss is compounded by inadequate amounts of11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 681insulating subcutaneous fat; lack of muscle tone and flex- ion to conserve heat; inadequate brown fat to generateheat; limited muscle mass activity, reducing the possibilityof producing their own heat; inability to shiver to generateheat; and an immature temperature-regulating center inthe brain (Blackburn, 2007). Preventing cold stress, whichwould increase the newborn's metabolic and oxygen needs,is crucial. The goal is to create a neutral thermal environ-ment in which oxygen consumption is minimal but bodytemperature is maintained (Kenner & Lott, 2007). In addition, the preterm newborn is especially sus- ceptible to hypoglycemia due to immature glucose con-trol mechanisms, decreased glucose stores, and a reducedavailability of alternative fuels such as ketone bodies.682 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Thin, transparent skin with visible veins Breast and nipples not clearly delineated Abundant vernix caseosa (Kenner & Lott, 2007) Be alert for evidence that might suggest that the pre- term newborn is developing a complication (see Table 23.1earlier in the chapter). Review the maternal history to identify risk factors for preterm birth and check antepartum and intrapartumrecords for maternal infections to anticipate the need fortreatment. Maternal risk factors associated with pretermbirth include a previous preterm delivery, low socio-economic status, preeclampsia, hypertension, poor ma-ternal nutrition, smoking, multiple gestation, infection,advanced maternal age, and substance abuse. Assess the newborn's gestational age and assess for IUGR if appropriate. Inspect the newborn's skin closely,especially skin color. Assess vital signs, including temper-ature via skin probe to identify hypothermia or fever, andheart rate for tachycardia or bradycardia. Evaluate thenewborn's respiratory effort and respiratory rate. Observefor periods of apnea lasting longer than 20 seconds. Mon-itor oxygen saturation levels by pulse oximetry to validateperfusion status. Note and report any signs of respiratorydistress. Auscultate lung and heart sounds, being espe-cially alert for possible murmur, which would indicate thepresence of patent ductus arteriosus in a preterm newborn. Assess neurologic status by observing the newborn's behavior. Note any restlessness, hypotonia, or weak cryor sucking effort and report unusual ndings. Monitor laboratory studies such as hemoglobin and hematocrit for signs of polycythemia. Screen for hypo-glycemia upon admission and then hourly, always ob-serving for nonspecific signs of hypoglycemia such aslethargy, poor feeding, and seizures. Evaluate serum biliru-bin concentrations. Also assess the mother and family members. Identify family strengths and coping mechanisms to establish abasis for intervention. Nursing Management The birth of a preterm newborn creates a crisis for themother and family. Multiple studies have found thathospitalization for preterm newborns is often followedby negative mental health/behavioral outcomes, anxietyand depressive disorders, and developmental problems(Melnyk, Feinstein, & Fairbanks, 2006). Preterm new-borns present with immaturity of all organ systems, abun-dant physiologic challenges, and signicant morbidity andmortality (Kenner & Lott, 2007). The nurse must be vig-ilant for complications when managing preterm newborns(Fig. 23.3 and Nursing Care Plan 23.1). Promoting Oxygenation Newborns normally start to breathe without assistance andoften cry after birth, being stimulated by a change in pres- Glucose is needed by the brain and CNS to maintain and support numerous body system functions.Take NOTE! Nursing Assessment Preterm newborns are at high risk for numerous problemsand require special care. When preterm labor developsand cannot be stopped by medical interventions, plans forappropriate management of the mother and the pretermnewborn are necessary, such as transporting them to a re-gional center with facilities to care for preterm newbornsor notifying the facility's NICU. Depending on the degreeof prematurity, the preterm newborn may be kept in theNICU for months. A thorough assessment of the preterm newborn upon admission to the nursery provides a baseline from whichto identify changes in clinical status. Be aware of thecommon physical characteristics and be able to identifyany deviation from the expected (Fig. 23.2). Commonphysical characteristics of preterm infants may include: Birthweight of less than 5.5 lb Scrawny appearance Head disproportionately larger than chest circumference Poor muscle tone Minimal subcutaneous fat Undescended testes Plentiful lanugo (soft, downy hair), especially over the face and back Poorly formed ear pinna, with soft, pliable cartilage Fused eyelids Soft and spongy skull bones, especially along suture lines Matted scalp hair, wooly in appearance Absent to a few creases in the soles and palms Minimal scrotal rugae in male infants; prominent labia 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 682sure gradients and environmental temperature. The work of taking that rst breath is primarily due to overcomingthe surface tension of the walls of the terminal lung unitsat the gas-tissue interface. Subsequent breaths require lessinspiratory pressure since there is an increase in functionalcapacity and air retained. By 1 minute of age, most new-CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 683 borns are breathing well. A newborn who fails to establish adequate, sustained respiration after birth is said to haveasphyxia . On a physiologic level, it is dened as an im- pairment in gas exchange resulting in a decrease in oxygenin the blood (hypoxemia) and an excess of carbon dioxideor hypercapnia that leads to acidosis. Asphyxia is the most AB C D E F FIGURE23.2 Characteristics of a preterm newborn. ( A) Few plantar creases. ( B) Soft, pliable ear cartilage, matted hair, and fused eyelids.

The preterm infant lacks surfactant. Surfactant lowers surface tension in the alveoli and stabilizes them to preventtheir collapse. Even if preterm newborns can initiate res-pirations, they have a limited ability to retain air due toinsufcient surfactant. Therefore, preterm newborns de-velop atelectasis quickly without alveoli Theinability to initiate and establish respirations leads to hypo-xemia and ultimately hypoxia (decreased oxygen), acido-sis (decreased pH), and hypercarbia (increased carbondioxide). This change in the newborn's biochemical envi-ronment may inhibit the transition to extrauterine circula-tion, thus allowing fetal circulation patterns to persist. Failure to initiate extrauterine breathing or failure to breathe well after birth leads to hypoxia (too little oxygenin the cells of the body). As a result, the heart rate falls,cyanosis develops, and the newborn becomes hypotonicand unresponsive. Although this can happen with anynewborn, the risk is higher in preterm newborns. Prevention and early identication of newborns at risk are key. Prenatal risk factors that can help identify thenewborn who may need resuscitation at birth secondaryto asphyxia include: History of substance abuse Gestational hypertension Fetal distress due to hypoxia before birth Chronic maternal diseases such as diabetes or a heart or renal condition Maternal or perinatal infection684 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Placental cord problems or prolapsed) Difcult or traumatic birth Multiple births Congenital heart disease Maternal anesthesia or recent analgesia birth (Neonatal Handbook, 2007i) Note the newborn's Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes. If the score is below 7 at either time, resuscitation efforts areneeded. Several diagnostic studies may be done to identifyunderlying etiologies. For example, a chest x-ray helps toidentify structural abnormalities that might interfere withrespirations. Blood studies may be done, such as culturesto rule out an infectious process, a toxicology screen to de-tect any maternal drugs in the newborn, and a metabolicscreen to identify any metabolic conditions (Lissauer &Weindling, 2007). Monitor vital signs continuously, checkblood glucose levels for hypoglycemia secondary to stress,and maintain a neutral thermal environment to promoteenergy conservation and minimize oxygen consumption. Resuscitating the Newborn Any newborn can be born with asphyxia without warn-ing. Approximately 10% of newborns require some assis-tance to begin breathing at birth. Anticipation, adequatepreparation, accurate evaluation, and prompt initiationof support are critical for successful newborn resuscita-tion. Have all basic equipment immediately available andin working order. Ensure that the equipment is evaluateddaily, and document its condition and any needed re-pairs. Box 23.2 lists the equipment needed for basic new-born resuscitation. Determine the need for resuscitation by performing a rapid assessment using the following four questions: What is the gestational age of this newborn? Was the amniotic fluid clear of meconium or cloudy (infection present)? Is the newborn breathing or crying now? Does the newborn have good muscle tone? If the answers are \"yes\" to all questions, then routine care is initiated: provide warmth, clear the airway, dry thenewborn, and assess color. If the answer to any of thesequestions is \"no,\" the newborn should receive one ormore of the following actions, according to this sequence: 1. Stabilization\u2014Dry the newborn thoroughly with a warm towel; provide warmth by placing him or herunder a radiant heater to prevent rapid heat lossthrough evaporation; position the head in a neutralposition to open the airway; clear the airway with abulb syringe or suction catheter; stimulate breathing.At times, handling and rubbing the newborn with adry towel may be all that is needed to stimulaterespirations.

When Mary Kaye was born, she had respiratory distress and hypoglycemiaand couldn't stabilize her temperature. Assessment revealed the following: newborn described as scrawny in appearance;skin thin and transparent with prominent veins over abdomen; hypotonia with lax, extended positioning; weak sucking reflex when nipple offered; respiratory distress with tachypnea (70 breaths/min), nasal flaring, and sternal retractions; lowblood glucose level suggested tachycardia, jitteriness; temperature of 36 \u00b0C 2,146 length 45 cm (17.72 inches). NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective breathing pattern related to immature respiratory system and respiratory distress as evidenced by tachypnea, nasal flaring, and sternal retractions Outcome Identication and Evaluation Newborn's respiratory status returns to adequate level of functioning as evidenced by rate remaining within 30 to 60 breaths/min, maintenance of acceptable oxygen saturation levels, and minimal to absent signs of respiratory distress. Interventions: Promoting Optimal Breathing Pattern Assess gestational age and risk factors for respiratory distress to allow early detection. Anticipate need for bag and mask setup and wall suction to allow for prompt intervention should respiratory status continue to worsen. Assess respiratory effort (rate, character, effort) to identify changes. Assess heart rate for tachycardia and auscultate heart sounds to determine worsening of condition. Observe for cues (grunting, shallow respirations, tachypnea, apnea, tachycardia, central cyanosis, hypotonia, increased effort) to identify need for additional oxygen. Maintain slight head elevation to prevent upper airway obstruction. Assess skin color to evaluate tissue perfusion. Monitor oxygen saturation level via pulse oximetry to provide objective indication of perfusion status. Provide supplemental oxygen as indicated and ordered to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation. Assist with any ordered diagnostic tests, such as chest x-ray and arterial blood gases, to determine effectiveness of treatments. Cluster nursing activities to reduce oxygen consumption. Maintain a neutral thermal environment to reduce oxygen consumption. Monitor hydration status to prevent fluid volume decit or overload. Explain all events and procedures to the parents to help alleviate anxiety and promote understanding of the newborn's condition. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective thermoregulation related to lack of fat stores and hypotonia as evidenced by extended positioning, low axillary temperature despite warmed blanket, respiratory distress, and lethargy Outcome Identication and Evaluation Newborn will demonstrate ability to regulate temperature as evidenced by temperature remaining in normal range (36.5 \u00b0to 37.5 \u00b0C) and absent signs of cold stress. Interventions: Promoting Thermoregulation Assess the axillary temperature every hour or use a thermistor probe to monitor for changes. Review maternal history to identify risk factors contributing to problem. Monitor vital signs, including heart rate and respiratory rate, every hour to identify deviations. Check radiant heat source or isolette to ensure maintenance of appropriate temperature of the environment. Assess environment for sources of heat loss or gain through evaporation, conduction, convection, or radiation to minimize risk of heat loss. Avoid bathing and exposing newborn to prevent cold stress. Warm all blankets and equipment that come in contact with newborn; place warmed cap on the newborn's head and keep it on to minimize heat loss.

The decision to progress from one set of actions to the next and the need for further resuscitative efforts isdetermined by the assessment of respirations, heart rate,and color (AHA/AAP, 2006). When performing newborn resuscitation, use the mnemonic \"ABCDs\" (airway, breathing, circulation, anddrugs) to remember the sequence of steps (Box 23.3). Resuscitation measures are continued until the new- born has a pulse above 100 bpm, a good cry, or good686 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK breathing efforts and a pink tongue. This last sign indicates a good oxygen supply to the brain (AHA/AAP, 2006). Throughout the resuscitation period, keep the par- ents informed of what is happening to their newborn andwhat is being done and why. Provide support through thisinitial crisis. Once the newborn is stabilized, encouragebonding by having them stroke, touch, and when appro-priate hold the newborn. Administering Oxygen Oxygen administration is a common therapy in newbornnurseries. Although it has been used in newborns for over75 years, there is no universal agreement on the most ap-Encourage kangaroo care (mother or father holds preterm infant underneath clothing skin-to-skin and upright betweenbreasts) to provide warmth. Educate parents on how to maintain a neutral thermal environment, including importance of keeping the newborn warm with a cap and double-wrapping with blankets and changing them frequently to keep dry to promote newborn's adjustment. Demonstrate ways to safeguard warmth and prevent heat loss. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to poor sucking and lack of glycogen stores necessary to meet the newborn's increased metabolic demands as evidenced by weak sucking reflex, lowbirthweight, and signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, including lethargy, tachycardia, and jitteriness Outcome Identication and Evaluation Newborn will demonstrate adequate nutritional intake, remaining free of signs of hypoglycemia as evidenced by blood glucose levels being maintained above 45 mg/dL, enhanced sucking ability, and appropriate weight gain. Interventions: Promoting Optimal Nutrition Identify newborn at risk based on behavioral characteristics, body measurements, and gestational age to establish a baseline and allow for early detection. Assess blood glucose levels as ordered to determine status and establish a baseline for interventions. Obtain blood glucose measurements upon admission to nursery and every 1 to 2 hours as indicated to evaluate for changes. Observe behavior for signs of low blood glucose to allow early identication. Initiate early oral feedings or gavage feedings to maintain blood glucose levels. If oral or gavage feedings aren't tolerated, initiate an IV glucose infusion to aid in stabilizing blood glucose levels. Assess skin for pallor and sweating to identify signs of hypoglycemia. Assess neurologic status for tremors, seizures, jitteriness, and lethargy to identify further drops in blood glucose levels. Monitor weight daily for changes to determine effectiveness of feedings. Maintain temperature using warmed blankets, radiant warmer, or warmed isolette to prevent heat loss and possible cold stress and reduce energy demands. Monitor temperature to prevent cold stress resulting in decreased blood glucose levels. Offer opportunities for non-nutritive sucking on premature-size pacier to satisfy sucking needs. Monitor for tolerance of oral feedings, including intake and output, to determine effectiveness. Administer IV dextrose if newborn is symptomatic to raise blood glucose levels quickly. Decrease energy requirements, including clustering care activities and providing rest periods, to conserve glucose and glycogen stores. Inform parents about procedures and treatments, including rationale for frequent blood glucose levels, to help reduce their anxiety.Nursing Care Plan 23.1 (continued)11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 686propriate range at which oxygen levels should be main- tained for newborns experiencing hypoxia, nor is there astandard time frame for oxygen to be administered(Neonatal Handbook, 2007d). While this uncertaintycontinues, nurses will experience a wide variation in prac-tice in terms of modes of administration, monitoring,blood levels, and target ranges for both short- and long-term oxygen therapy. A guiding principle, though, is that oxygen therapy should be targeted to levels appropriate to the condition,gestational age, and postnatal age of the newborn. Oxygentherapy must be used judiciously to prevent retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) , a major cause of blindness in preterm newborns in the past. ROP is a potentially blind-ing eye disorder that occurs when abnormal blood vesselsgrow and spread through the retina, eventually leading toretinal detachment. The incidence of ROP is inverselyproportional to the preterm baby's birthweight. Approxi-mately 400 to 600 children become blind because of ROPin the United States annually (Lyon & Warren, 2006). Although the role of oxygen in the pathogenesis of ROP is unclear, current evidence suggests that it is linkedto the duration of oxygen use rather than the concentra-tion. Thus, the use of 100% oxygen to resuscitate a new-born should not pose a problem (National Eye Institute,2007). However, an ophthalmology consult for follow-upafter discharge is essential for preterm infants who havereceived extensive oxygen therapy. See Chapter 38 for amore in-depth discussion of this condition. Respiratory distress in preterm infants is commonly caused by a deciency of surfactant, retained fluid in thelungs (wet lung syndrome), meconium aspiration, pneu-monia, hypothermia, or anemia. The principles of care arethe same regardless of the cause of respiratory distress.First, keep the newborn warm, preferably in a warmed iso-CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 687 lette or with an overhead radiant warmer, to conserve the baby's energy and prevent cold stress. Handle the newbornas little as possible, because stimulation often increases theoxygen requirement. Provide energy through calories viaintravenous dextrose or gavage or continuous tube feed-ings to prevent hypoglycemia. Treat cyanosis with an oxy-gen hood or blow-by oxygen placed near the newborn'sface if respiratory distress is mild and short-term therapyis needed. Record the following important observationsevery hour or more frequently if indicated, and documentany deterioration or changes in respiratory status: Respiratory rate, quality of respirations, and respira- tory effort Airway patency, including removal of secretions per facility policy Skin color, including any changes to duskiness, blue- ness, or pallor Lung sounds on auscultation to differentiate breath sounds in upper and lower elds Equipment required for oxygen delivery, such as: Blow-by oxygen delivered via mask or tube for short- term therapyBOX 23.2 Basic Equipment for Newborn Resuscitation A wall vacuum suction apparatus A wall source or tank source of 100% oxygen with a flow meter A neonatal self-inflating ventilation bag with correct-sized face masks A selection of endotracheal tubes (2.5, 3.0, or 3.5 mm) with introducers A laryngoscope with a small, straight blade and spare batteries and bulbs Ampules of naloxone (Narcan) with syringes and needles A wall clock to document timing of activities and events A supply of disposable gloves in a variety of sizes for staff to useBOX 23.3 ABCDs of Newborn Resuscitation Airway Place infant's head in \"snifng\" position. Suction mouth, then nose. Suction trachea if meconium-stained and newborn is NOT vigorous (strong respiratory effort, good muscletone, and heart rate > 100 bpm). Breathing Use positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) for apnea, grasping, or pulse <100 bpm. Ventilate at rate of 40 to 60 breaths/minute. Listen for raising heart rate, audible breath sounds. Look for slight chest movement with each breath. Use carbon dioxide detector after intubation. Circulation Start compressions if heart rate is <60 after 30 seconds of effective PPV. Give 3 compressions: 1 breath every 2 seconds. Compress one third of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest. Drugs Give epinephrine if heart rate is <60 after 30 seconds of compressions and ventilation. Caution: Epinephrine dosage is different for endotracheal IV 1:10,000 concentration /H185460.1 via endotracheal tube (AHA/AAP,2006)11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 687 Oxygen hood (oxygen is delivered via a plastic hood placed over the newborn's head) Nasal cannula (oxygen is delivered directly through the nares) (Fig. 23.4A) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which prevents collapse of unstable alveoli and delivers highlevels of inspired oxygen into the lungs Mechanical ventilation, which delivers consistent assisted ventilation and oxygen therapy, reducingthe work of breathing for the fatigued infant (seeFig. 23.4B) Correct placement of endotracheal tube (if present) Heart rate, including any changes Oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximetry to evaluate need for therapy modications based on hemoglobin Maintenance of oxygen saturation level from 87% to 95% (Aylott, 2006b) Nutritional intake, including calories provided, to pre- vent hypoglycemia and method of feeding, such asgavage, intravenous, or continuous enteral feedings Hydration status, including any signs and symptoms of fluid overload Laboratory tests, including ABGs, to determine effec- tiveness of oxygen therapy Administration of medication, such as exogenous surfactant If the newborn shows worsening cyanosis or if oxygen saturation levels fall below 87%, prepare to give additionaloxygen as ordered. Throughout care, strict asepsis, includ-ing handwashing, is vital to reduce the risk of infection. Maintaining Thermal Regulation Immediately after birth, dry the newborn with a warmedtowel and then place him or her in a second warm, drytowel before performing the assessment. This drying pre-vents rapid heat loss secondary to evaporation. Newbornswho are active, breathing well, and crying are stable andcan be placed on their mother's chest (\"kangaroo care\")688 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK to promote warmth and prevent hypothermia. Preterm newborns who are not considered stable may be placedunder a radiant warmer or in a warmed isolette after theyare dried with a warmed towel. Typically newborns use nonshivering thermogenesis for heat production by metabolizing their own brown adi-pose tissue. However, the preterm newborn has an in-adequate supply of brown fat because he or she left theuterus before it was adequate. The preterm newborn alsohas decreased muscle tone and thus cannot assume theflexed fetal position, which reduces the amount of skin ex-posed to a cooler environment. In addition, preterm new-borns have large body surface areas compared to weight.This allows an increased transfer of heat from their bod-ies to the environment. Typically, a preterm newborn who is having problems with thermal regulation is cool to cold to the touch. Thehands, feet, and tongue may appear cyanotic. Respira-tions are shallow or slow, or signs of respiratory distressare present. The newborn is lethargic and hypotonic,feeds poorly, and has a feeble cry. Blood glucose levels areprobably low, leading to hypoglycemia, due to the energyexpended to keep warm. When promoting thermal regulation for the preterm newborn: Remember the four mechanisms for heat transfer and ways to prevent loss: Convection: heat loss through air currents (avoid drafts near the newborn) Conduction: heat loss through direct contact (warm everything the newborn comes in contact with, suchas blankets, mattress, stethoscope) Radiation: heat loss without direct contact (keep iso- lettes away from cold sources and provide insulationto prevent heat transfer) Evaporation: heat loss by conversion of liquid into vapor (keep the newborn dry and delay the rst bathuntil the baby's temperature is stable) A B FIGURE23.4 (A) A preterm newborn receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula. The newborn also has an enteral feeding tube inserted for nutrition. ( B) A preterm newborn receiving mechanical ventilation.11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 688 Frequently assess the temperature of the isolette or ra- diant warmer, adjusting the temperature as necessaryto prevent hypo- or hyperthermia. Assess the newborn's temperature every hour until stable. Observe for clinical signs of cold stress, such as respi- ratory distress, central cyanosis, hypoglycemia,lethargy, weak cry, abdominal distention, apnea,bradycardia, and acidosis. Remember the complications of hypothermia and fre- quently assess the newborn for signs: Metabolic acidosis secondary to anaerobic metabo- lism used for heat production, which results in theproduction of lactic acid Hypoglycemia due to depleted glycogen stores Pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary vasoconstriction Monitor the newborn for signs of hyperthermia such as tachycardia, tachypnea, apnea, warm to touch, flushedskin, lethargy, weak or absent cry, and CNS depression;adjust the environmental temperature appropriately. Explain to the parents the need to maintain the new- born's temperature, including the measures used;demonstrate ways to safeguard warmth and preventheat loss. Promoting Nutrition and Fluid Balance Providing nutrition is challenging for preterm newbornsbecause their needs are great but their ability to take in op-timal amounts of energy/calories is reduced due to theircompromised health status. Individual nutritional needsare highly variable. Depending on their gestational age, preterm new- borns receive nutrition orally, enterally, or parenterally viainfusion. Several different methods can be used to providenutrition: parenteral feedings administered through a per-cutaneous central venous catheter for long-term venousaccess with delivery of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), orenteral feedings, which can include for compromised newborns to allow themto rest during the feeding process. Many have a weak suckand become fatigued and thus cannot consume enoughcalories to meet their needs. Most newborns born after 34 weeks' gestation with- out signicant complications can feed orally. Those bornbefore 34 weeks' gestation typically start with parenteralnutrition within the rst 24 hours of life. Then enteral nu-trition is introduced and advanced based on the degree ofmaturity and clinical condition. Ultimately, enteral nutri-tion methods replace parenteral nutrition. To promote nutrition and fluid balance in the preterm newborn: Measure daily weight and plot it on a growth curve. Monitor intake; calculate fluid and caloric intake daily.CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 689 Assess fluid status by monitoring weight; urinary out- put; urine specic gravity; laboratory test electrolyte creatinine,and hematocrit; skin turgor; and fontanels (Kenner &Lott, 2007). Be alert for signs of dehydration, such as adecrease in urinary output, sunken fontanels, tempera-ture elevation, lethargy, and tachypnea. Continually assess for enteral feeding intolerance; measure abdominal girth, auscultate bowel sounds,and measure gastric residuals before the next tubefeeding. Encourage and support breastfeeding by facilitating maternal breast pumping. Encourage nuzzling at the breast in conjunction with kangaroo care if the newborn is stable. When assessing the fluid status of a preterm newborn, palpate the fontanels. Sunken fontanels suggest dehydration; bulging fontanels suggestoverhydration.Take NOTE! Preventing Infection Prevention of infection is critical when caring for preterm newborns. Infections are the most common cause of mor-bidity and mortality in the NICU population (Kenner &Lott, 2007). Nursing assessment and early identicationof problems are imperative to improve outcomes. Preterm newborns are at risk for infection because their early birth deprived them of maternal antibodiesneeded for passive protection. Preterm newborns also aresusceptible to infection because of their limited ability toproduce antibodies, asphyxia at birth, and thin, friableskin that is easily traumatized, providing an entry portalfor microorganisms. Early detection is crucial. The clinical manifestations can be nonspecic and subtle: apnea, diminished activ-ity, poor feeding, temperature instability, respiratory dis-tress, seizures, tachycardia, hypotonia, irritability, pallor,jaundice, and hypoglycemia. Report any of these to theprimary care provider immediately so that treatment canbe instituted. Include the following interventions when caring for a preterm or postterm newborn to prevent infection: Assess for risk factors in maternal history that place the newborn at increased risk. Monitor for changes in vital signs such as temperature instability, tachycardia, or tachypnea. Assess oxygen saturation levels and initiate oxygen therapy as ordered if oxygen saturation levels fallbelow acceptable parameters. Assess feeding tolerance, typically an early sign of infection.11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 689 Monitor laboratory test results for changes. Avoid using tape on the newborn's skin to prevent tearing. Use equipment that can be thrown away after use. Adhere to standard precautions; use clean gloves to handle dirty diapers and dispose of them properly. Use sterile gloves when assisting with any invasive procedure; attempt to minimize the use of invasiveprocedures. Remove all jewelry on your hands prior to washing hands; wash hands upon entering the nursery and inbetween caring for newborns. Avoid coming to work when ill, and screen all visitors for contagious infections. Preventing Complications Preterm newborns face a myriad of possible complicationsas a result of their fragile health status or the proceduresand treatments used. Some of the more common compli-cations in preterm newborns delayed growth and development, andmental or motor delays (March of Dimes, 2007b). Sev-eral of these complications are described in Chapter 24. Remember Anna, who was in a state of shock when she entered the NICU to see her preterm baby for the rst time?How could the nurse have prepared her for this event? Whatinformation needs to be given at the isolette to reduce heranxiety and fear now? Providing Appropriate Stimulation Newborn stimulation involves a series of activities to en-courage normal development. Research on developmentalinterventions shows that when preterm newborns, in par-ticular, receive sensorimotor interventions such as rocking,skin-to-skin contact with parents, containment (swaddlingand surrounded by blanket rolls), music, non-nu tritive sucking, breastfeeding, massage, holding, or sleeping onwaterbeds, they gain weight faster, progress in feedingabilities more quickly, and show improved interactive be-havior compared to preterm newborns who were not stim-ulated (Field et al., 2006). Conversely, overstimulationmay have negative effects by reducing oxygenation andcausing stress. A newborn reacts to stress by flaying thehands or bringing an arm up to cover the face. When over-stimulated, such as by noise, lights, excessive handling,alarms, and procedures, and stressed, heart and respira-tory rates decrease and periods of apnea or bradycardiamay follow (Blackburn, 2007). Appropriate developmental stimulation that would not overtax the compromised newborn might include690 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK kangaroo (skin-to-skin) holding, rocking, soft singing or music, cuddling, gentle stroking of the infant's skin, color-ful mobiles, gentle massage, waterbed mattresses, and non-nutritive sucking opportunities (Fig. 23.5) or providingsucrose if tolerated. The NICU environment can be altered to provide periods of calm and rest for the newborn by dimming thelights, lowering the volume and tone of conversations,closing doors gently, setting the telephone ringer to thelowest volume possible, clustering nursing activities, andcovering the isolette with a blanket to act as a light shieldto promote rest at night. Encourage parents to hold and interact with their newborn. Doing so helps to acquaint the parents withtheir newborn, promotes self-confidence, and fosters parent-newborn attachment (Fig. 23.6). Think back to Anna, the woman who gave birth to a preterm newborn at 7 months' gestation. Anna will bedischarged but her newborn will be staying in the NICU for awhile. What interventions would be appropriate to facilitatebonding despite their separation? What support can beprovided specically to her family? Managing Pain Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experiencefelt by all humans. Newborns feel pain and require thesame level of pain assessment and management as adults.Common indicators of pain in the newborn who is unable FIGURE23.5 A preterm newborn receiving non-nutritive sucking.11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM 690to include facial expressions, body movements, and physiologic changes (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Un-treated pain in newborns may result in increased morbid- ity and length of stay in the NICU, exaggerated responses to pain in later life, and altered psychosocial development(Koeppel, 2007). Parents commonly expect that healthcare providers will use appropriate measure to preventpain in their newborns, but there are gaps in knowledge about the most effective way to accomplish this. Assessment of pain in the newborn remains a con- tentious and vexing problem. Newborns in the NICU aresubjected to repeated procedures that cause them pain.Newborns, whether preterm, full term, or postterm, doexperience pain, but the pain is difcult to validate with consistent behaviors. Considering that ill newborns un- dergo multiple noxious stimuli from invasive procedures,such as lumbar punctures, sticks, lineinsertions, specimen collections,endotracheal intubation and suctioning, and mechanicalventilation, common sense would suggest that newbornsexperience pain from these many activities and interven-tions. However, pain management in infants was notaddressed formally until various professional and accred-iting organizations issued position statements and clini-cal recommendations in an effort to promote effective painmanagement (AAP, 2006a, 2006b). An international con-sortium established principles of newborn pain prevention and management that all nurses must be familiar withand apply (Box 23.4). Several psychometric tools are available to assess pain in the newborn. Examples include the Pain AssessmentTool (PAT), which evaluates respirations, heart rate, oxy-CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 691 gen saturation, and blood pressure; the Premature Infant Pain Prole (PIPP), which assesses heart rate and oxygensaturation; the CRIES tool (cry, requires oxygen, in- creased vital signs, expression and sleeplessness); and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), which evaluates res-piratory patterns. Most are based on facial expressions,crying patterns, change in vital signs, and body move-ments (AAP, 2006a). Nurses play a key role in assessing a newborn's pain level. Assess the newborn frequently. Pain is considered the \"fth vital sign\" and should be assessed as frequentlyas the other four vital signs. Differentiate pain from agi-tation by observing for changes in vital signs, behavior,facial expression, and body movement. Suspect pain if the newborn exhibits the following: Sudden high-pitched cry Facial grimace with furrowing of brow and quivering chin Increased muscle tone Oxygen desaturationBOX 23.4 Newborn Pain Prevention and Management Guidelines Newborn pain frequently goes unrecognized and undertreated. Pain assessment is an essential activity prior to pain management. Newborns experience pain, and analgesics should be given. A procedure considered painful for an adult should also be considered painful for a newborn. Developmental maturity and health status must be considered when assessing for pain in newborns. Newborns may be more sensitive to pain than adults. Pain behavior is frequently mistaken for irritability and agitation. Newborns are more susceptible to the long-term effects of pain. Adequate pain management may reduce complications and mortality. Nonpharmacologic measures can prevent, reduce, or eliminate newborn pain. Sedation does not provide pain relief and may mask pain responses. A newborn's response to both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain therapy should be assessedwithin 30 minutes of administration or intervention. Health care professionals are responsible for pain assessment and treatment. Written guidelines are needed on each newborn unit. Source: Kenner & Lott, 2007. FIGURE 23.6 A mother bonding with her preterm newborn.11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/14/08 12:14 PM Page 691 Body posturing, such as squirming, kicking, arching Limb withdrawal and thrashing movements Increase in heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, and respirations Fussiness and irritability (Arenson & Drake, 2007) The goals of pain management are to minimize the amount, duration, and severity of pain and to assist thenewborn in coping. Effective pain management strategiesfor newborns include preventing, limiting, or avoidingnoxious stimuli; using nonpharmacologic techniques toreduce pain; and administering pharmacologic agentswhen appropriate. Box 23.5 lists some of the more com-monly used nonpharmacologic pain management tech-niques for the preterm newborn. The number of analgesics available for use with preterm newborns is limited. Morphine and fentanyl, usu-ally administered intravenously, are the most commonlyused opioids for moderate to severe pain. Acetaminophenis effective for mild pain. Benzodiazepines are used assedatives during painful procedures and can be combinedwith opioids for more effectiveness. Local or topical anes-thetics (e.g., EMLA cream) also may be used before pro-cedures such as venipuncture, lumbar puncture, andintravenous catheter insertion (AAP, 2006b). Be vigilant in assessing for adverse effects (respiratory depression or hypotension) when administering pharma-cologic agents for pain management, especially in preterm692 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK newborns with neurologic impairment. These negative effects are usually dose- and route-related, so be knowl-edgeable about the pharmacokinetics and therapeuticdosing of any drug administered. Promoting Growth and Development In the late 1970s, researchers evaluated the NICU envi- ronment in terms of light and sound levels, caregivingactivities, and handling of newborns. As a result of thisresearch, many environmental modications were madeto reduce the stress and overstimulation of the NICU, andthe concept of developmentally supportive care was intro-duced. Developmentally supportive care is dened as careof a newborn or infant to support positive growth and de-velopment. Developmental care focuses on what new-borns or infants can do at that stage of development; ituses therapeutic interventions only to the point that theyare benecial; and it provides for the development of thenewborn-family unit (Neonatal Handbook, 2007b). Developmental care is a philosophy of care that re- quires rethinking the relationships between newborns,families, and health care providers. It includes a variety ofactivities designed to manage the environment and individ-ualize the care of the preterm or high-risk ill newborn basedon behavioral observations (see Evidence-Based Practice23.1). The goal is to promote a stable, well-organized new-born who can conserve energy for growth and development(Hendricks-Munoz & Prendergast, 2007). Developmental care includes these strategies: Clustering care to promote rest and conserve the infant's energy Flexed positioning to simulate in utero positioning Environmental management to reduce noise and visual stimulation Kangaroo care to promote skin-to-skin sensation Placement of twins in the same isolette or open crib to reduce stress Activities to promote self-regulation and state regulation: Surrounding the newborn with nesting rolls/devices Swaddling with a blanket to maintain the flexed position Providing sheepskin or a waterbed to simulate the uterine environment Providing non-nutritive sucking (calms the infant) Providing objects to grasp (comforts the newborn) Promotion of parent-infant bonding by making par- ents feel welcome in the NICU Open, honest communication with parents and staff Collaboration with the parents in planning the infant's care (Davidson et al., 2007) Developmental care can be fostered by clustering the lights in one area so that no lights are shining directly onnewborns, installing visual alarm systems and limitingoverhead pages to minimize noise, and monitoring contin-uous and peak noise levels. Nurses can play an active roleBOX 23.5 Nonpharmacologic Techniques to Reduce Pain in the Preterm Newborn Gentle handling, rocking, caressing, cuddling, and massaging Rest periods before and after painful procedures Kangaroo care (skin-to-skin contact) during procedure Breastfeeding, if able, to reduce pain from minor procedures Use of a facilitated tuck (holding arms and legs in a flexed position) Application of topical anesthetics prior to venipuncture or lumbar puncture Swaddling and positioning to establish physical boundaries Non-nutritive sucking (pacier dipped in sucrose) prior to procedure Minimal use of tape, with gentle removal to avoid skin tears Warm blankets for wrapping to facilitate relaxation Reduction of environmental stimuli by removing or turning down noxious stimuli such as noise fromalarms, beepers, loud conversations, and bright lights Distraction, such as with colored objects or mobiles (AAP, 2006a, 2006b)11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 692by serving on committees that address these issues. In ad- dition, nurses can provide direct developmentally support-ive care. Doing so involves careful planning of nursingactivities to provide the ideal environment for the new-born's development. For example: Dim the lights and cover isolettes at night to simulate nighttime. Support early extubation from mechanical ventilation. Encourage early and consistent feedings with breast milk. Administer prescribed antibiotics judiciously. Position the newborn as if he or she was still in utero (a nesting fetal position). Promote kangaroo care by encouraging parents to hold the newborn against the chest for extended periodseach day. Coordinate care to respect sleep and awake states.CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 693 Throughout the newborn's stay, work with the par- ents, developing a collaborative partnership so they feelcomfortable caring for their newborn. Be prepared tomake referrals to community support groups to enhancecoping (McGrath, 2006). Promoting Parental Coping Generally, pregnancy and the birth of a newborn are ex-citing times, but when the newborn has serious, perhapslife-threatening problems, the exciting experience sud-denly changes to one of anxiety, fear, guilt, loss, and grief. Parents are typically unprepared for the birth of a preterm newborn and commonly experience an array ofemotions, including disappointment, fear for the survivalof the newborn, and anxiety due to the separation fromtheir newborn immediately after birth (Mok & Sui, 2006).Early interruptions in the bonding process and concernSymington, A., & Pinelli, J. (2006). Developmental care for promoting development and preventing morbidity in preterm infants. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006. Issue 2. Art. No.: CD001814. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001814.pub2.Study Preterm newborns are at risk due to their immature body systems. This is compounded by the newborn's increasedrisk for complications and illnesses and his or her exposureto numerous stimuli in the NICU environment. Together,these stressors can interfere with the newborn's growthand development. Developmental care is a philosophy that includes a wide range of activities to manage the environment and individualize care. The belief is that it canreduce the effects of these stressors. Activities typicallyassociated with developmental care include controlling external stimuli, clustering care activities, and positioningand swaddling the preterm newborn. A study was done to examine the effects of developmental care on preterm newborns. The study evaluated relevantoutcomes such as neurodevelopment, weight gain, lengthof hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, andphysiologic stress. A computerized search of all articles,controlled trials, and conference and symposia proceedingswas done. Two independent experts identied the datafrom all relevant randomized trials that compared the elements of developmental care to routine nursery care fornewborns less than 37 weeks' gestation. The researchersidentied 36 controlled trials. Findings Assessing the benefits of developmental care was difficult because most of the studies reviewed includedmultiple interventions and many of the trials had small sample sizes. Therefore, the authors could not determinewhether any one intervention was more effective than another. Overall, they reported that developmental carehad limited benefits and no major harmful effects. It hada limited benet on decreasing moderate to severe chroniclung disease, decreasing the incidence of necrotizing colitis, and improving family outcomes. Evidence was also limited related to the long-term positive effect on behavior and movement at 5 years corrected age. However,individualized developmental care activities showed some positive effects in improving neurodevelopmentaloutcomes. Nursing Implications Although the study found that developmental care forpreterm newborns was of limited benefit, it emphasizedthat this type of care had no major harmful effects.Nurses can integrate these findings into their care forpreterm newborns with the understanding that they arebeneficial but that the effect may be limited. Nurses canadvocate for individualizing the activities involved in developmental care based on the newborn's needs. They also can play a key role in fostering research tohelp determine which stressors seem to be the mosttroublesome and which specific activities are of thegreatest benefit. In addition, nurses can assist in identifying appropriate short- and long-term outcomemeasures. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 23.1 Promoting Development and Preventing Morbidity in Preterm Infants11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 693about the newborn's survival can create extreme anxiety and interfere with attachment (Mercer & Walker, 2006). Nursing interventions aimed at reducing parental anxiety include: Reviewing with them the events that have occurred since birth Providing simple relaxation and calming techniques (visual imagery, breathing) Exploring their perception of the newborn's condition and offering explanations Validating their anxiety and behaviors as normal reac- tions to stress and trauma Providing a physical presence and support during emotional outbursts Exploring the coping strategies they used successfully in the past and encouraging their use now Encouraging frequent visits to the NICU Addressing their reactions to the NICU environment and explaining all equipment used Identifying family and community resources available to them (Franklin, 2006) Preparing for Discharge Discharge planning typically begins with evidence that re- covery of the newborn is certain. However, the exact dateof discharge may not be predictable. The goal of the dis-charge plan is to make a successful transition to home care.Essential elements for discharge are a physiologically sta-ble infant, a family who can provide the necessary care withappropriate support services in place in the community,and a primary care physician available for ongoing care. The care of each high-risk newborn after discharge requires careful coordination to provide ongoing multi-disciplinary support for the family. The discharge planningteam typically includes the parents, primary care physician,neonatologists, neonatal nurses, and a social worker. Otherprofessionals, such as surgical specialists and pediatric sub-specialists, occupational, physical, speech, and respiratorytherapists, nutritionists, home health care nurses, and acase manager, may be included as needed. Critical compo-nents of discharge planning are summarized in Box 23.6. Nurses involved in the discharge process are instru- mental in bridging the gap between the hospital and home.Interventions typically include: Assessing the physical status of the mother and the newborn Discussing the early signs of complications and what to do if they occur Reinforcing instructions for infant care and safety Stressing the importance of proper car seat use Providing instructions for medication administration Reinforcing instructions for equipment operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting Teaching infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency care694 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Demonstrating techniques for special care procedures such as dressings, ostomy care, articial airway main-tenance, chest physiotherapy, breastfeeding or instruction on gav- age feedings Assisting with dening roles in the adjustment period at home Assessing the parents' emotional stability and coping status Providing support and reassurance to the family Reporting abnormal ndings to the health care team for intervention Following up with parents to assure them that they have a \"lifeline\" Dealing With Perinatal Loss Perinatal loss is a profound experience for the family. Itengenders a unique kind of mourning since the infant isso much a part of the parents' identity. Instead of celebrat-ing a new life as they expected, parents are mourning theloss of dreams and hopes and the loss of an extension ofthemselves. NICU nurses face a difcult situation whencaring for newborns who may not survive. Newborn deathis incomprehensible to most parents. This makes thegrieving process more difcult because what is happening\"can't be real.\" Deciding whether to see, touch, or holdthe dying newborn is extremely difcult for many parents.Nurses play a major role in assisting parents to make theirdying newborn \"real\" to them by providing them with asBOX 23.6 Critical Components of Discharge Planning Parental education\u2014involvement and support in newborn care during NICU stay will ensure theirreadiness to care for the infant at home Evaluation of unresolved medical problems\u2014review of the active problem list and determination of whathome care and follow-up is needed Implementation of primary care\u2014completion of newborn screening tests, immunizations, examinationssuch as funduscopic exam for ROP, and hematologicstatus evaluation Development of home care plan, including assessment of: Equipment and supplies needed for care In-home caregiver's preparation and ability to care for infant Adequacy of the physical facilities in the home An emergency care and transport plan if needed Financial resources for home care costs Family needs and coping skills Community resources, including how they can be accessed11223-23_UT8-CH23.qxd 8/4/08 3:06 PM Page 694CHAPTER 23 NURSING CARE OF THE NEWBORN WITHSPECIAL NEEDS 695 Before the newborn's death After the newborn's death At the time of the release of thenewborn's bodyRespect variations in the family's spiritual needs and readiness. Assess cultural beliefs and practices that may bring comfort; respect culturally appropriate requests for truth telling and informed refusal. Initiate spiritual comfort by calling the hospital clergy if appropriate; offer to pray with the family if appropriate. Encourage the parents to take photographs, make memory boxes, and record their thoughts in a journal. Explore with family members how they dealt with previous losses.Discuss techniques to reduce stress, such as meditation and relaxation.Recommend that family members maintain a healthy diet and get adequate rest and exercise to preserve their health. Participate in early and repeated care conferencing to reduce family stress.Allow family to be present at both medical rounds and resuscitation; provide explanations of all procedures, treatments, and ndings; answer questions honestly and as completely as possible. Provide opportunities for the family to hold the newborn if they choose to.Assess the family's support network.Provide suggestions as to how friends can be helpful to the family. Help the family to accept the reality of death by using the word \"died.\" Acknowledge their grief and the fact that their newborn has died.Help the family to work through their grief by validating and listening.Provide the family with realistic information about the causes of death.Offer condolences to the family in a sincere manner.Encourage the father to cry and grieve with his partner.Provide opportunities for the family to hold the newborn if they desire. Reassure the family that their feelings and grieving responses are normal. Encourage the parents to have a funeral or memorial service to bring closure.Suggest that the parents plant a tree or flowers to remember the infant.Address attachment issues concerning subsequent pregnancies.Provide information about local support groups.Provide anticipatory guidance regarding the grieving process.Present information about any impact on future childbearing, and refer the parents to appropriate specialists or genetic resources.TABLE 23.2 ASSISTING PARENTS TO COPEWITHPERINATAL LOSSmany memories as possible and encouraging them to see, hold, touch, dress, and take care of the infant and takephotographs. These actions help to validate the parents'sense of loss, relive the experience, and attach signicanceto the meaning of loss. A lock of hair, a name card, or anidentication bracelet may serve as important mementoesthat can ease the grieving process. The memories createdby these interventions can be useful allies in the grievingprocess and in resolving grief (Callister, 2006). Parent-newborn interaction is vital to the normal processes of attachment and bonding. The detachmentprocess involved in a newborn's death is equally importantfor parents. Nurses can aid in this process by helping par-ents to see their newborn through the maze of equipment,explaining the various procedures and equipment, encour-aging them to express their feelings about the newborn'sstatus, and providing time for them to be with their dyingnewborn (Kavanaugh & Moro, 2006). A common reaction by many people when learning that a newborn is not going to survive is one of avoidance.Nurses are no exception. It is difcult to initiate a conver-sation about such a sensitive issue without knowing how the parents are going to react and cope with the impend-ing loss. One way to begin a conversation with the parentsis to convey concern and acknowledge their loss. Activelistening can give parents a safe place to begin the healingprocess. The relationship that the nurse establishes withthe parents is a unique one, providing an opportunity forboth the nurse and the parents to share their feelings. Be aware of personal feelings about loss and how these feelings are part of one's own life and personal belief sys-tem. Actively listen to the parents when they are talkingabout their experiences. Communicate empathy (under-standing and feeling what another person is feeling), re-spect their feelings, and respond to them in helpful andsupportive ways (Kavanaugh & Moro, 2006). Table 23.2highlights appropriate interventions for a family experi-encing a perinatal loss before and after a newborn dies. In a time of crisis or loss, individuals are often more sensitive to other people's reactions. For example, the par-ents may be extremely aware of the nurse's facial expres-sions, choice of words, and tone of voice. Talking quickly, Sources: Callister, 2006; PM Page 695in a businesslike fashion, or ignoring the loss may inhibit parents from discussing their pain or how they are copingwith it. Parents may need to vent their frustrations andanger, and the nurse may become the target. Validate theirfeelings and attempt to reframe or refocus the anger to-ward the real issue of loss. An example would be to say, \"Iunderstand your frustration and anger about this situation.You have experienced a tremendous loss and it must bedifcult not to have an explanation for it at this time.\"Doing so helps to defuse the anger while allowing them toexpress their feelings. When assisting bereaved parents, start where the par- ents are in the grief process to avoid imposing your ownagenda on them. You may feel uncomfortable at not beingable to change the situation or take the pain away. Thenurse's role is to provide immediate emotional support andfacilitate the grieving process. Supporting and strengthen-ing the family bond in the face of perinatal loss is essential. LATE PRETERM NEWBORN A late preterm newborn is an infant born between 34 weeks and 36 weeks, 6 days of gestation. In recent years, thesubject of late preterm birth has received much attention,since this population of preterm newborns represents morethan 70% of all preterm births in the United States andhas increased by 30% in the past 20 years (National Cen-ter for Health Statistics, 2006). With the sharp rise in thenumber of cesarean births performed, the incidence oflate preterm newborns will also rise. Perinatal nurses needto understand the risks of late preterm births and theunique needs of this population to facilitate timely assess-ment and intervention to improve outcomes. Some of the challenges facing the late preterm new- born include respiratory distress (secondary to cesareanbirths, maternal gestational diabetes, chorioamnionitis,premature rupture of membranes, and fetal distress);thermoregulation issues related to limited ability to flexthe trunk and extremities to decrease exposed surfacearea; hypoglycemia related to the rst two challenges(respiratory distress and cold stress); jaundice and hyper-bilirubinemia related to a gestational age of 36 weeks orless; and feeding challenges related to immature suck andswallowing reflexes (Askin et al., 2007). These challengesare similar to those facing the preterm newborn and re-quire similar management. Nurses and parents must beaware of the risks associated with late preterm births tooptimize care and outcomes for this group of newborns. /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Variations in birthweight and gestational age can place a newborn at risk for problems that require special care.696 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK /H18546Variations in birthweight include the following cate- gories: small for gestational age, appropriate for gesta-tional age, and large for gestational age.

These newborns are consideredat risk: that is, they are susceptible to morbidity and mor-tality because of the acquired or congenital disorder. Sev-eral National Health Goals address the issues of acquiredand congenital conditions in newborns (Healthy Peo-ple 2010). Technological and pharmacologic advances, in con- junction with standardized policies and procedures, overthe past several decades have signicantly improved sur-vival rates for at-risk newborns. However, morbidity re-mains an important sequela. For example, some of thesenewborns are at risk for continuing health problems thatrequire long-term technological support. Other newbornsremain at risk for physical and developmental problemsinto the school years and beyond. Providing the complexcare needed to maintain the child's health and well-beingwill have a tremendous emotional and economic impacton the family. Nurses are challenged to provide supportto mothers and their families when neonatal well-being isthreatened. Acquired disorders typically occur at or soon after birth. They may result from problems or conditions ex-perienced by the woman during her pregnancy or atbirth, such as diabetes, maternal infection, or substanceabuse, or conditions associated with labor and birth,such as prolonged rupture of membranes or fetal dis-tress. However, there may be no identifiable cause forthe disorder. Congenital disorders are disorders present at birth, usually due to some type of malformation that occurredduring the antepartal period. Congenital disorders, whichtypically involve a problem with inheritance, include struc-tural anomalies (commonly referred to as birth defects),A9.Outline the assessment, interventions, prevention, and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. 10.Summarize the interventions appropriate for a newborn with neonatal sepsis. 11.Compare and contrast the four classications of congenital heart disease. 12.Describe the major acquired congenital anomalies affecting the central nervous system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, genitouri-nary system, and musculoskeletal system that can occur in a newborn. 13.Discuss three inborn errors of metabolism. 14.Formulate a plan of care for a newborn with an acquired or congenital condition. 15.Discuss the importance of parental participation in care of the new- born with an acquired or congenital condition, including the nurse'srole in facilitating parental involvement.LEARNING OBJECTIVES (continued) chromosomal disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism.Most congenital disorders have a complex etiology, involv-ing many interacting genes, gene products, and social andenvironmental factors during organogenesis. Some alter-ations can be prevented or compensated for with phar-macologic, nutritional, or other types of interventions,while others cannot be changed. Only through a betterunderstanding of the complex interplay of genetic, envi-ronmental, social, and cultural factors can these devastat-ing and life-changing outcomes be prevented (Arenson &Drake, 2007). This chapter addresses selected acquired and con- genital newborn conditions. In addition, it describes thenurse's role in assessment and management, emphasiz-ing parental education and support. Nurses play a keyrole in helping the parents cope with the stress of havingan ill newborn. Acquired Disorders NEONATAL ASPHYXIA As the newborn makes the transition to life outside the fluid-filled intrauterine environment, dramatic changesmust occur to facilitate newborn respirations. New-borns normally start to breathe with routine warming,drying, airway suctioning, and mild stimulation. Mostnewborns make this transition such that by 1 minute ofage, they are breathing well on their own. A newbornwho fails to establish adequate, sustained respirationafter birth is said to have asphyxia . Physiologically, asphyxia can be defined as impaired gas exchange re-sulting in a decrease in blood oxygen levels (hypox-emia) and an excess of carbon dioxide or hypercapniathat leads to acidosis.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 701Asphyxia is the most common clinical insult in the perinatal period. As many as 10% of newborns requiresome degree of active resuscitation to stimulate breathing(Cunningham et al., 2005). According to the World HealthOrganization, 4 to 9 million cases of neonatal asphyxiaoccur annually worldwide, accounting for approximately20% of all newborn deaths. More than a million newbornswho survive asphyxia at birth develop long-term problemssuch as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and speaking,hearing, visual, and learning disabilities (Maternal andNeonatal Health [MNH], 2007). Pathophysiology Asphyxia occurs when oxygen delivery is insufcient to meet metabolic demands, resulting in hypoxia, hypercar-bia, and metabolic acidosis. Any condition that reducesoxygen delivery to the fetus can result in asphyxia. These702 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK conditions may include maternal hypoxia, such as from cardiac or respiratory disease, anemia, or postural hypo-tension; maternal vascular disease that leads to placentalinsufciency, such as diabetes or hypertension; cord prob-lems such as compression or prolapse; and posttermpregnancies, which may trigger meconium release intothe amniotic fluid. Initially, the newborn uses compensatory mecha- nisms including tachycardia and vasoconstriction to helpbring oxygen to the vital organs for a time. However,without intervention, these mechanisms fail, leading to hypotension, bradycardia, and eventually cardiopul-monary arrest. With failure to breathe well after birth, the newborn will develop hypoxia (too little oxygen in the cells of thebody). As a result, the heart rate falls, cyanosis develops,and the newborn becomes hypotonic and unresponsive.1. Reduce fetal and infant deaths Decrease the number of all infant deaths (within 1 year) from a baseline of 7.2/1,000 live births to 4.5/1,000 live births. Decrease the number of neonatal deaths (within the rst 28 days of life) from a baseline of 4.8 to 2.9 deaths/1,000 livebirths. Decrease the number of post-neonatal deaths from a base- line of 2.4 to 1.2 deaths/1,000 live births. Reduce the number of deaths related to all birth defects from a baseline of 1.6 to 1.1 deaths/1,000 live births. 2.

Review the perinatal history for risk fac-tors, including: Trauma: injury to the central or peripheral nervous system secondary to a long or difcult labor, a precipi-tous birth, multiple gestation, abnormal presentation,cephalopelvic disproportion, shoulder dystocia, or extraction by forceps or vacuum Intrauterine asphyxia: for example, fetal hypoxia sec- ondary to maternal hypoxia, diabetes, hypertension,anemia, cord compression, or meconium aspiration Sepsis: acquired bacterial or viral organisms from infected amniotic fluid, maternal infection, or directcontact while passing through the birth canal Malformation: congenital anomalies including facial or upper airway deformities, renal anomalies, pulmonaryhypoplasia, neuromuscular disorders, esophageal atre-sia, to placenta previa, or cord rupture resulting in bloodloss to the fetus Medication: drugs given to mother during labor that can affect the fetus by causing placental hypoperfusionand hypotension; use of hypnotics, analgesics, anes-thetics, narcotics, oxytocin, and street drugs duringpregnancy At birth, assess the newborn immediately. Observe the infant's color, noting any pallor or cyanosis. Assessthe work of breathing. Be alert for apnea, tachypnea,gasping respirations, grunting, nasal flaring, bradycardia. Assessthe newborn's temperature, noting hypothermia. De-termine the Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes; an Apgarscore below 7 at either time indicates that resuscitationis needed. Anticipate diagnostic testing to identify etiologies for the newborn's asphyxia. For example, a chest x-ray mayidentify structural abnormalities that might interfere withrespiration. A blood culture may identify an infectiousprocess. A blood toxicology screen may detect any mater-nal drugs in the newborn (Kenner & Lott, 2007).CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 703 Nursing Management Management of the newborn experiencing asphyxia in- cludes immediate resuscitation. Ensure that the equip-ment needed for resuscitation is readily available and inworking order. Essential equipment includes a wall suc-tion apparatus, an oxygen source, a newborn ventilationbag, endotracheal tubes (2 to 3 mm), a laryngoscope, andampules of naloxone (Narcan) with syringes and needlesfor administration (see Chapter 23 for a more detailed dis-cussion of resuscitation). Dry the newborn quickly with a warm towel and then place him or her under a radiant heater to prevent rapidheat loss through evaporation. Handling and rubbing thenewborn with a dry towel may be all that is needed tostimulate breathing. If the newborn fails to respond tostimulation, then active resuscitation is needed. The procedure for newborn resuscitation is easily re- membered by the \"ABCDs\"\u2014airway, breathing, circula-tion, and drugs (see Chapter 23, Box 23.3). Continueresuscitation until the newborn has a pulse above 100 bpm,a good cry, or good breathing efforts and a pink tongue.This last sign indicates a good oxygen supply to the brain(Brodsky & Ouellette, 2007).Think back to Kelly, described at the beginning of the chapter. She gives birth to a son weighing approximately2,500 g; he appears postterm and small for gestational age.His skin is stained yellow-green and he is limp, cyanotic,and apneic at birth. The initial assessment once the newbornis under the radiant warmer indicates that resuscitation andtracheal suctioning are needed. What is the nurse's roleduring What assessments will be neededduring this procedure? Take NOTE! According to the American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics Emergency Care Guidelines for NeonatalResuscitation, resuscitation efforts may be stopped ifthe newborn exhibits no heart beat and no respiratoryeffort after 10 minutes of continuous and adequate resuscitation (AHA/AAP, 2005; Zaichkin, 2006). Provide continued observation and assessment of the newborn who has been successfully resuscitated. Monitorthe newborn's vital signs and oxygen saturation levelsclosely for changes. Maintain a neutral thermal environ-ment to prevent hypothermia, which would increase thenewborn's metabolic and oxygen demands. Check theblood glucose level and observe for signs of hypoglycemia;if this develops, it can further stress the newborn. The need for resuscitative measures can be extremely upsetting for the parents. Explain to them the initial re-suscitation activities being performed and offer ongoingexplanations about any procedures being done, equip-ment being used, or medications given. Provide physicaland emotional support to the parents through the initialcrisis and throughout the newborn's stay. When the new-born is stable, allow parents to spend time with theirnewborn to promote bonding (Fig. 24.1). Point out thenewborn's positive attributes and give frequent updateson his or her status.

Passage through the birth canal during a vaginal birthcompresses the thorax, which helps remove the majorityof this fluid. Pulmonary circulation and the lymphaticdrainage remove the remaining fluid shortly after birth.TTN occurs when the liquid in the lung is removedslowly or incompletely. Nursing Assessment Astutely observe the newborn with respiratory distress be-cause TTN is a diagnosis of exclusion. Initially it might bedifficult to distinguish this condition from respiratorydistress syndrome or group B streptococcal pneumonia,since the clinical picture is similar. However, the symp-toms of transient tachypnea rarely last more than 72 hours(McLenan, 2007). Health History and Physical Examination Review the perinatal history for contributing factors.TTN is commonly seen in newborns who are sedated orhave been born via cesarean birth. Also check the historyfor evidence of a prolonged labor, fetal macrosomia, andmaternal asthma and smoking. These factors are associ-ated with a higher incidence of TTN. Closely assess the newborn for signs of TTN. Within the rst few hours of birth, observe for tachypnea, expi-ratory grunting, retractions, labored breathing, (Asenjo, 2007). Mild to moderaterespiratory distress is present by 6 hours of age, with res-piratory rates as high as 100 to 140 breaths per minute(Kenner & Lott, 2007). Also inspect the newborn's chestfor hyperextension or a barrel shape. Auscultate breathsounds, which may be slightly diminished secondary toreduced air entry. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing To aid in the diagnosis, a chest x-ray may be done. It usu-ally reveals mild symmetric lung overaeration and of retainedfetal fluid (Asenjo, 2007). Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on providing adequate oxy-genation and determining whether the newborn's respira-tory manifestations appear to be resolving or persisting.Provide supportive care while the retained lung fluid is re-absorbed. Administer intravenous (IV) fluids and/or gav-age feedings until the respiratory rate decreases enoughto allow safe oral feeding. Provide supplemental oxygen viaa nasal cannula or oxygen hood to maintain adequate oxy-gen saturation. Maintain a neutral thermal environmentwith minimal stimulation to minimize oxygen demand. Provide ongoing assessment of the newborn's respi- ratory status. As TTN resolves, the newborn's respiratory FIGURE24.1 A father interacting with his newborn once the newborn's condition has stabilized. Remember Kelly, the young woman described at the beginning of the chapter? Her son is intubated and trachealsuctioning is performed. Positive-pressure ventilation is alsostarted with a self-inflating bag and 50% oxygen. Ventilationis continued for 1 minute and then gradually discontinued.The heart rate is now 120 bpm, and spontaneous respirationsare noted. When free-flow oxygen is administered, thenewborn begins to cry and turn pink. What continued care isneeded in the special care nursery? What explanation shouldbe offered to Kelly regarding her son's treatment? TRANSIENT TACHYPNEA OF THE NEWBORN Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a condi- tion involving a mild degree of respiratory distress. It isdescribed as the retention of lung fluid or transient pul-monary edema (McLenan, 2007). It usually occurs withina few hours of birth and resolves by 72 hours of age.TTN occurs in approximately 11 per 1,000 live births(Asenjo, 2007). Pathophysiology Most newborns make the transition from fetal to new-born life without incident. During fetal life, the lungs arelled with a serous fluid because the placenta, not thelungs, is used for nutrient and gas exchange. During and11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 704rate declines to 60 breaths per minute or less, the oxygen requirement decreases, and the chest x-ray shows reso-lution of the perihilar streaking. Provide reassurance andprogress reports to the parents to help them cope withthis crisis. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Despite improved survival rates and advances in perinatal care, many high-risk newborns are at risk for respiratoryproblems, particularly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a breathing disorder resulting from lung immatu-rity and lack of alveolar surfactant. Since the link betweenRDS and surfactant deciency was discovered more than30 years ago, tremendous strides have been made in un-derstanding the pathophysiology and treatment of this dis-order. The introduction of prenatal steroids to acceleratelung maturity and the development of synthetic surfactantcan be credited with the dramatic improvements in theoutcome of newborns with RDS. RDS affects an estimated 25,000 infants born alive in the United States annually. The incidence declines withdegree of maturity at birth. It occurs in 60% of pretermnewborns of less than 28 weeks' gestation, 30% of thoseborn at 28 to 34 weeks, and less than 5% of those bornafter 34 weeks (American Lung Association [ALA], 2007). Intensive respiratory care, usually with mechanical venti-lation, is necessary. Pathophysiology Lung immaturity and surfactant deciency contribute tothe development of RDS. Surfactant is a complex mixtureof phospholipids and proteins that adheres to the alveolarsurface of the lungs. Surfactant forms a coating over theinner surface of the alveoli, reducing the surface tensionand preventing alveolar collapse at the end of expiration.In the affected newborn, surfactant is decient or lacking,and this decit results in stiff lungs and alveoli that tend tocollapse, leading to diffuse atelectasis. The work of breath-ing is increased because increased pressure similar to thatrequired to initiate the first breath is needed to inflatethe lungs with each successive breath. Hypoxemia and acidemia result, leading to occurs andalveolar capillary circulation is limited, further inhibitingsurfactant production. As the disease progresses, fluid andbrin leak from the pulmonary capillaries, causing hyalinemembranes to form in the bronchioles, alveolar ducts, andalveoli. These membranes further decrease gas exchange.A vicious circle is created, compounding the problem(Blackburn, 2007).CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 705 Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment focuses on keen observation to iden- tify the signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. In ad-dition, assessment aids in differentiating RDS from otherrespiratory conditions, such as TTN or group B strepto-coccal pneumonia. Health History and Physical Examination Review the history for risk factors associated with RDS;these include perinatal asphyxia regardless of gestationalage, cesarean birth in the absence of preceding labor (dueto the lack of thoracic squeezing), male gender, and ma-ternal diabetes. It is believed that each of these conditionshas an impact on surfactant production, thus resulting inRDS in the term infant (Stoll & Kliegman, 2007). Take NOTE! Prolonged rupture of membranes, intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR), gesta- tional hypertension, maternal heroin addiction, anduse of prenatal corticosteroids reduce the newborn's riskfor RDS because of the physiologic stress imposed onthe fetus. Chronic stress experienced by the fetus inutero accelerates the production of surfactant before the35th week of gestation and thus reduces the incidenceof RDS at birth. The newborn with RDS usually demonstrates signs at birth or within a few hours of birth. Observe the infant forexpiratory grunting, nasal flaring, chest wall retractions,seesaw respirations, and generalized cyanosis. Auscultatethe heart and lungs, noting tachycardia (rates above 150 to180), ne inspiratory crackles, and tachypnea (rates above60 breaths per minute). Use the Silverman-Anderson indexassessment tool to determine the degree of respiratory dis-tress. The index involves observation of ve features, eachof which is scored as 0, 1, or 2 (Fig. 24.2). The higher thescore, the greater the respiratory distress. A score over7 suggests severe respiratory distress. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The diagnosis of RDS is based on the clinical pictureand x-ray findings. A chest x-ray reveals hypoaeration,underexpansion, and a \"ground glass\" pattern (Brodsky& Ouellete, 2007; Simpson & Creehan, 2008). Nursing Management If untreated, RDS will worsen. However, it appears to bea self-limiting disease, with respiratory symptoms declin-ing after 72 hours. This decline parallels the production ofsurfactant in the alveoli (McLenan, 2007). The newbornneeds supportive care surfactant is produced. Effec-11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 705tive therapies for established RDS include conventional mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pres-sure (CPAP), or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)to prevent volume loss during expiration, and surfactanttherapy. The use of exogenous surfactant replacementtherapy to stabilize the newborn's lungs until postnatalsurfactant synthesis matures has become a life-saver. Care of the newborn with RDS is primarily supportive and requires a multidisciplinary approach to obtain the bestoutcomes. Therapy focuses on improving oxygenation andmaintaining optimal lung volumes. Expect to transfer thenewborn to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) soonafter birth. Apply the basic principles of newborn care, suchas thermoregulation, cardiovascular and nutritional sup-port, normal glucose level maintenance, and infection706 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK prevention, to achieve the therapeutic goals of reducing mortality and minimizing lung trauma. Anticipate the administration of surfactant replace- ment therapy, prophylactically or as a rescue approach.With prophylactic administration, surfactant is givenwithin minutes after birth, thus providing replacement sur-factant before severe RDS develops. Rescue treatment isindicated for newborns with established RDS who requiremechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. The ear-lier the surfactant is administered, the better the effect ongas exchange (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Administer the prescribed oxygen concentration via nasal cannula.

Recent studies show no difference in outcomes for newborns who received earlytreatment with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation com-pared with those receiving conventional mechanical venti-lation (Blackburn, 2007). Although mechanical ventilationhas increased survival rates, it is also a contributing factorto bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension,and retinopathy of prematurity (Cunningham et al., 2005). In addition, support the newborn with RDS using the following interventions: Continuously monitor the infant's cardiopulmonary status via invasive or noninvasive means (e.g., arteriallines or auscultation, respectively). Monitor oxygen saturation levels continuously; assess pulse oximeter values to determine oxygen saturationlevels. Closely monitor vital signs, acid-base status, and arterial blood gases. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics if blood cultures are positive. Administer sodium bicarbonate or acetate as ordered to correct metabolic acidosis. Provide fluids and vasopressor agents as needed to prevent or treat hypotension. Test blood glucose levels and administer dextrose as ordered for prevention or treatment of hypoglycemia. Cluster caretaking activities to avoid overtaxing and compromising the newborn. Place the newborn in the prone position to optimize respiratory status and reduce stress. Perform gentle suctioning to remove secretions and maintain a patent airway. Assess level of consciousness to identify intraventricu- lar hemorrhage. Provide sufcient calories via gavage and IV feedings. Maintain adequate hydration and assess for signs of fluid overload.CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 707 Provide information to the parents about treatment modalities; give thorough but simple explanations aboutthe rationales for interventions and provide support. Encourage the parents to participate in care (Blackburn, 2007). Provide ongoing assessment and be alert for compli- cations. These may include air leak syndrome, broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (chronic lung disease), patent ductusarteriosus, thrombus and developmentaldelay or disability (Stoll & Kliegman, 2007). MECONIUM ASPIRATION SYNDROME Meconium is a viscous green substance composed primar- ily of water and other gastrointestinal secretions that canbe noted in the fetal gastrointestinal tract as early as 10 to16 weeks' gestation (Clark & Clark, 2007). It is expelledas the newborn's rst stool after birth. Meconium aspi- ration syndrome occurs when the newborn inhales par- ticulate meconium mixed with amniotic fluid into thelungs while still in utero or on taking the rst breath afterbirth. It is a common cause of newborn respiratory distressand can lead to severe illness. Meconium staining of theamniotic fluid, with the possibility of aspiration, occurs inapproximately 20% of pregnancies at term (Cunninghamet al., 2005). Aspiration induces airway obstruction, sur-factant dysfunction, hypoxia, and chemical pneumonitiswith inflammation of pulmonary tissues. In severe cases,it progresses to persistent pulmonary hypertension anddeath (Cunningham et al., 2005). About 3% to 5% of in-fants with meconium aspiration syndrome die (Wiswell,Tin, & Ohler, 2007). Pathophysiology Meconium may be passed in utero secondary to hypoxicstress. Hypoxia induces the fetus to gasp or attempt tobreathe. The fetus may bear down and pass meconiuminto the amniotic fluid or he or she may experience a vagalreflex that causes relaxation of the anal sphincter, allow-ing meconium to be passed into the amniotic fluid. Thefetus then sucks or swallows this amniotic fluid in utero,or the infant may aspirate meconium with the rst breathafter birth as air rushes into the lungs. Although the etiology is not well understood, the effects of meconium can be harmful to the fetus. Meco-nium alters the amniotic fluid by reducing antibacterialactivity and subsequently increasing the risk of perinatalbacterial infection. Additionally, meconium is very irritat-ing because it contains enzymes from the fetal pancreas. FIGURE24.3 A newborn with RDS receiving mechanical ventilation.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 707When aspirated into the lungs, meconium blocks the bronchioles, causing an inflammatory reaction as well asa decrease in surfactant production. Gas exchange is im-paired and atelectasis occurs. A ball-valve effect occurswhen air is inspired into the alveoli but cannot be fully ex-pired secondary to reduced airway diameter. Signicantrespiratory distress is followed by persistent pulmonaryhypertension, right-to-left shunting of (ECMO), nitricoxide, high-frequency ventilation, or liquid ventilationmay be necessary. Nursing Assessment Review prenatal and birth records to identify newbornswho may be at high risk for meconium aspiration. Predis-posing factors for meconium aspiration syndrome includepostterm pregnancy; breech, forceps, or vacuum extractionbirths; prolonged or difcult labor associated with fetal dis-tress in when the maternal membranes rupture. Green-stained amni-otic fluid suggests the presence of meconium in the amni-otic fluid and should be reported immediately. After birth,note any yellowish-green staining of the umbilical cord,nails, and skin. This staining indicates that meconium hasbeen present for some time.708 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Observe the newborn for a barrel-shaped chest with an increased anterior-posterior (AP) chest diameter (sim-ilar to that found in a patient with chronic obstructivepulmonary disease), prolonged tachypnea, progressionfrom mild to severe and cyanosis (Clark noting coarse crack-les and rhonchi. Chest x-rays show patchy, fluffy inltrates unevenly distributed throughout the lungs and marked hyperaera-tion mixed with areas of atelectasis. Arterial blood gasanalysis will indicate metabolic acidosis with a low bloodpH, decreased PaO 2, and increased PaCO 2(Wiswell, Tin, & Ohler, 2007). Direct visualization of the vocal cords formeconium staining using a laryngoscope can conrm thepresence of meconium below the larynx. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on ensuring adequate tissue perfusion and minimizing oxygen demand and energy ex-penditure. Caring for the newborn with meconium aspi-ration begins in the birthing unit when the birth attendantidentifies meconium-stained amniotic fluid with mem-brane rupture during labor. Upon delivery of the new- born's head, before the newborn takes the rst breath, the nasal cavity and then the posterior pharynx are gently suc-tioned to decrease the potential for aspiration. If the new-born is signicantly depressed at birth, secondary clearingof the lower airways by direct tracheal suctioning may benecessary. Repeated suctioning and stimulation are lim-ited to prevent overstimulation and further depression(Clark & Clark, 2007). Usually the newborn is transferredto the NICU for close monitoring. Maintain a neutral thermal environment, including placing the newborn under a radiant warmer or in awarmed isolette, to prevent hypothermia. In addition,minimize handling to reduce energy expenditure andoxygen consumption that could lead to further hypox-emia and acidosis. Administer oxygen therapy as ordered via nasal can- nula or with positive-pressure ventilation. Monitor oxygensaturation levels via pulse oximetry to evaluate the new-born's response to treatment and to detect changes. In-creased pulmonary pressures associated with meconiumaspiration may cause blood to be shunted away from thelungs. The newborn may exhibit uneven pulmonary venti-lation, with hyperinflation in some areas and atelectasis inothers. This leads to poor perfusion and subsequent hypox-emia, which in turn may increase pulmonary vasoconstric-tion, resulting in a worsening of hypoxemia and acidosis. Expect to administer hyperoxygenation to dilate the vasculature and close the ornitric oxide inhalation to use high-frequency oscillatory ventilation toincrease the chance of air trapping (Clark & Clark, 2007).In addition, administer vasopressors and pulmonaryConsider Kelly, the 27-year-old woman who gave birth to a son who required resuscitation. What ndings would leadthe nurse to suspect that her son aspirated meconium? Whatrisk factors in Kelly's history would support the diagnosis ofmeconium aspiration syndrome? Take NOTE! Standard prevention and treatment for meconium aspiration syndrome previously included suctioning the mouth and nares upon headdelivery before body delivery. However, recent evi-dence suggests that aspiration occurs in utero, not atdelivery; therefore, the infant's birth should not be impeded for suctioning. After full delivery, the infantshould be handed to a neonatal team for evaluationand treatment. Although infants previously have beengiven intubation and airway suctioning, current evi-dence favors expectant management unless certain cri-teria (i.e., spontaneous respiration, heart rate greaterthan 100 beats per minute, and reasonable tone) areabsent (Hermansen & Lorah, 2007).11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 708Almost any procedure, such as suctioning, weighing, changing diapers, or positioning, can precipitate severe hypoxemia due to the instabilityof the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, minimize thenewborn's exposure to stimulation as much as possible.Take NOTE! vasodilators as prescribed and administer surfactant as or- dered to counteract inactivation by meconium. Monitorarterial blood gas results for changes and assist with mea-sures to corre ct acid-base i mbalances to facilitate perfusion of tissues and prevent pulmonary hypertension (Simpson& Creehan, 2008). If these measures are ineffective, beprepared to assist with the use of ECMO, a modied typeof heart-lung machine. In addition, perform the following interventions: Cluster newborn care to minimize oxygen demand. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat bacte- rial pneumonia. Administer sedation to reduce oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. Continuously monitor the newborn's condition. Provide continuous reassurance and support to the parents throughout the experience (McLenan, 2007). PERSISTENT PULMONARY HYPERTENSION OF THE NEWBORN Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, previously referred to as persistent fetal circulation, is acardiopulmonary disorder characterized by marked pul-monary hypertension that causes right-to-left extrapul-monary shunting of blood and hypoxemia. Persistentpulmonary meconium aspirationsyndrome, hypothermia, hypo-volemia, hyperviscosity, acute hypoxia with delayedresuscitation, sepsis, and RDS. It occurs in 2 to 6 newbornsper 1,000 live births of term, near-term, or postterm infants (Steinhorn, 2007). Pathophysiology Normally, pulmonary artery pressure decreases when thenewborn takes the rst breath. However, interference withthis ability to breathe allows pulmonary pressures to remainincreased. Hypoxemia and acidosis also occur, leading tovasoconstriction of the pulmonary artery. These eventscause an elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance. Nor-mally, the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and pul-monary vascular resistance with breathing leads to theclosure of the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. How-ever, with persistent pulmonary hypertension, pulmonaryvascular resistance is elevated to the point that venousblood is diverted to some degree through fetal structures,such as the ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale, open, leading to a right-to-left shunting ofblood into the systemic circulation. This diversion of bloodbypasses the lungs, resulting in systemic arterial hypoxemia.CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 709 Nursing Assessment Assess the newborn's status closely. A newborn with per- sistent pulmonary hypertension demonstrates tachypneawithin 12 hours after birth. Observe for marked cyanosis,grunting, and retractions. Auscultate the heart, noting asystolic ejection murmur, and measure blood pressure forhypotension resulting from both heart failure and persis-tent hypoxemia (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Measure oxygensaturation via pulse oximetry and report low values. Pre-pare the newborn for an echocardiogram, which will revealright-to-left shunting of blood that conrms the diagnosis. Nursing Management When caring for the newborn with persistent pulmonaryhypertension, pay meticulous attention to detail, with con-tinuous monitoring of the newborn's oxygenation andperfusion status and blood pressure. The goals of therapyinclude improving alveolar oxygenation, inducing meta-bolic alkalosis hypovolemia with the admin-istration of volume replacement and vasopressors, andanticipating use of ECMO when support has failed tomaintain acceptable oxygenation (Steinhorn, 2007). Provide immediate resuscitation after birth and admin- ister oxygen therapy as ordered. Early and effective resus-citation and correction of acidosis and hypoxia are helpfulin preventing persistent pulmonary hypertension. Monitorarterial blood gases frequently to evaluate the effectivenessof oxygen therapy. Provide respiratory support, which fre-quently necessitates the use of mechanical ventilation. Ad-minister prescribed medications, monitor cardiopulmonarystatus, cluster care to reduce stimulation, and provide on-going support and education to the parents. BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, currently referred to as chronic lung disease, commonly occurs in infants whohave experienced a lung injury resulting in the need forcontinued use of oxygen after the initial neonatal period(28 days of life). Approximately 5,000 to 10,000 newcases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia occur each year.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 709White male infants seem to be at greatest risk for devel- oping bronchopulmonary dysplasia (ALA, 2007). Theoverall costs of treating dysplasia inthe United States are estimated to be $2.4 billion annu-ally (ALA, 2007). Newborns with bronchopulmonarydysplasia need hospital care for several months after birthand home oxygen therapy after being discharged. Pathophysiology Bronchopulmonary dysplasia results from an underlying lung injury. However, the etiology of the lung injury ismultifactorial: it is associated with surfactant deciency,pulmonary edema, lung immaturity, barotrauma frommechanical ventilation, and fluid overload. Lung injurycommonly occurs secondary to mechanical ventilationand oxygen toxicity, usually in infants who have had RDS.High inspired oxygen concentrations cause an inflam-matory process in the lungs that leads to parenchymaldamage (Driscoll & Davis, 2007). This damage includesepithelial stretching, invasion macrophages and poly- morphonuclear leukocytes, airway edema interfering withthe growth and development of lung structures, loss ofcilia, and a decrease in the number of alveoli. Therapeutic Management Bronchopulmonary dysplasia can be prevented by admin-istering steroids to the mother in the antepartal period andexogenous surfactant to the newborn to help reduce the riskfor RDS and its severity. In addition, using high-frequencyventilation and nitric oxide helps reduce the need for respi-ratory support with mechanical ventilation (Lowdermilk &Perry, 2007). Supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, and fluid restric- tion and diuretics to decrease fluid accumulation in thelungs are used. Bronchodilators are used to open the air-ways. Intravenous feedings are given to meet the infant'snutrition needs, and physical therapy is used to improvemuscle performance and to help the lungs expel mucus. Nursing Assessment Although bronchopulmonary dysplasia is most common in preterm newborns, it can also occur in full-term oneswho had respiratory problems during their rst days of life.Thus, it is essential to assess the newborn's history for riskfactors, including male gender, preterm birth (<32 weeks),nutritional deciencies, white race, excessive fluid intakeduring the rst few days of life, presence of patent ductusarteriosus, severe RDS treated with mechanical ventilationfor more than 1 week, and sepsis (Cutz & Chiasson, 2008).Also review the history for use of supplemental oxygen,the length of exposure to oxygen therapy, and the use of ventilatory support. Assess the infant for signs and symptoms of bron- chopulmonary dysplasia. These may include tachypnea,poor weight gain related to the increased metabolic work-710 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK load, tachycardia, sternal retractions, nasal flaring, and bronchospasm with abnormal breath sounds (crackles,rhonchi, and wheezes). Hypoxia, as evidenced by abnor-mal blood gas results, and acidosis and hypercapnia alsoare noted. Chest x-rays will show hyperinflation, inl-trates, and cardiomegaly. Nursing Management Nursing care includes providing continuous ventilatory andoxygen support and optimal nutrition to support growth,and administering bronchodilators, anti-inflammatoryagents, and diuretics as ordered. Continuously monitor thenewborn's respiratory status to determine the need for con-tinued ventilatory assistance. When the newborn is clini- cally stable and ready, expect to wean him or her slowly so that he or she can compensate for the changes. Sup-plemental oxygen may be needed after discharge fromthe hospital. Provide a high caloric intake to promotegrowth and to compensate for the calories expendeddue to the increased work of breathing. Some infants may require high-calorie formulas to foster adequate growth. Newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may require continued care at home. When planning for dis- charge, educate the family caretaker about how to managea chronically ill child who may be oxygen-dependent foran extended time. Provide ongoing support to parents asthey learn to meet their infant's needs. Also instruct thefamily about the safe use of oxygen in the home, includingthe need to notify emergency medical services and utilitycompanies that a technology-dependent child is living intheir district. In addition, initiate a social service referralto help the family access community resources and obtainnecessary support (Cutz & Chiasson, 2008). RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a developmental ab- normality that affects the immature blood vessels of theretina. The incidence of ROP in preterm newborns isinversely proportional to their birthweight. Of the approx-imately 4 million infants born in the United States annu-ally, about 28,000 weigh 1,500 grams (2.75 lb) or less.About 14,000 to 16,000 of these infants are affected bysome degree of ROP (National Eye Institute [NEI], 2008).ROP can lead to lifelong vision impairment and blindness(NEI, 2008). It can also lead to vitreous hemorrhage andretinal detachment (Greene, 2007). Pathophysiology The eye begins to develop early in gestation, at approxi-mately 16 weeks. Blood vessels begin to form and growto supply the retina, which transmits visual information11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 710to the brain, with oxygen and nutrients. These vessels continue to grow gradually until about the last 12 weeksof pregnancy (between 28 and 40 weeks' gestation), atwhich time the eye undergoes rapid development. Thus,an infant born at term has retinal vessels that are almostcompletely developed. However, when the infant is bornpreterm, normal blood vessel development may cease. ROP typically develops in both eyes secondary to an injury such as hyperoxemia due to prolonged assistiveventilation and high oxygen exposure, acidosis, and shock. Exposure to high oxygen concentrations leads to severeretinal vasoconstriction with endothelial damage andvessel obliteration. Abnormal blood vessels develop in anattempt to nourish the retina. These vessels, which pro-liferate in the retina, are highly fragile and bleed easily, leading to the formation of scar tissue. They also can en-large and twist, pulling the retina away from the wall ofthe eye and resulting in retinal detachment.CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 711 weight. Be especially alert for newborns weighing 1,500 grams or less or those born at 28 weeks' gestation or less.Evaluate the newborn's history for the duration of intuba-tion and the use of oxygen therapy, intraventricular hem-orrhage, and sepsis (Vision Channel, 2007). Prepare theinfant for an ophthalmologic examination. Nursing Management Institute measures for prevention. Administer oxygentherapy cautiously and monitor oxygen saturation levelsto ensure that the lowest oxygen concentration possibleis used and for the shortest possible duration. Cover theisolette with a blanket and dim the surrounding lights toprotect the newborn's eyes. Although the precise levels of hyperoxemia that can be sustained without causing retinopathy are not known, very immature newbornswho develop respiratory distress often must be given high oxygen concentrations to maintain life(Cunningham et al., 2005).Take NOTE! ROP is classied in ve stages, ranging from mild (stage I) to severe (stage V). The degree of abnormal bloodvessel growth and evidence of retinal detachment areused to stage this disorder. Therapeutic Management The key to treating ROP is prevention, by minimizing the risk of preterm birth through providing quality prenatalcare and health counseling to all pregnant women. WhenROP does develop, treatment depends on the stage anddegree of retinal ndings. Typically, stages I and II resolveon their own and require only periodic evaluation by theophthalmologist. For more advanced stages, surgical in-tervention such as laser therapy or cryotherapy can bedone. For later stages of ROP, scleral buckling surgery(stage IV or V) and/or vitrectomy (stage V) may be done. Nursing Assessment The newborn who develops ROP exhibits no signs orsymptoms, so assessment involves identifying the newbornat risk. Review the maternal prenatal history for risk fac-tors such as substance abuse, hypertension, preeclampsia,heavy cigarette smoking, or evidence of placental insuf-ficiency. Also assess the newborn's gestational age and Any newborn with a birthweight of less than 1,500 g or born at less than 28 weeks' gestation should be examined by a pediatric ophthal-mologist within 4 to 6 weeks after birth.Take NOTE! Assist with scheduling an ophthalmic examination for the newborn. Expect to administer a mydriatic eyeagent to dilate the newborn's pupils approximately 1 hourprior to the examination as ordered. During this time,take extra care to protect the newborn's eyes from brightlight. If necessary, provide assistance with the examina-tion by holding the newborn's head. Assist with schedul- ing follow-up eye examinations, usually every 2 to 3 weeksdepending on the severity of the clinical ndings at therst examination (Clark & Mandal, 2008). Provide support to the parents. This is an extremely difcult time for them: in addition to learning to meet theneeds of their preterm newborn, they must also deal withthe possibility that their baby may have a condition thatcould lead to blindness. Consider the family's needs andprovide individualized support and guidance. Provide in-formation about the newborn's condition and treatmentoptions. Stress the need for follow-up vision screenings,because ROP is a life-long disease. PERIVENTRICULAR- INTRAVENTRICULARHEMORRHAGE Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage is dened as bleeding that usually originates in the subependymal ger-minal matrix region of the brain, with extension into theventricular system (Brodsky & Ouellette, 2007). It is acommon problem in preterm infants, especially in those11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 711born before 32 weeks. A significant number of these newborns will incur brain injury, leading to complica-tions that may include hydrocephalus, seizure disorders, periventricular leukomalacia (an ischemic injury resultingfrom inadequate perfusion of the white matter adjacent tothe ventricles), cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, vision orhearing decits, and mental retardation. Identifying pre-ventive strategies to reduce the incidence of these brain in-sults is a national public health priority (McLenan, 2007). The incidence of ventricular hemorrhage depends on the gestational age at birth. Up to 50% of newbornsweighing 1,500 g or less or born at 30 weeks' gestation orless will have evidence of hemorrhage, whereas only about4% of term newborns show evidence of ventricular hemor-rhage. Very-low-birthweight infants have the earliest onsetof hemorrhage and highest mortality rate (Brodsky &Ouellette, 2007). Pathophysiology The preterm newborn is at greatest risk for periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage because cerebral vasculardevelopment is immature, making it more vulnerable toinjury. The earlier the newborn is, the greater the likeli-hood for brain damage. While all areas of the brain can beinjured, the periventricular area is the most vulnerable. Each ventricular area contains a rich network of cap- illaries that are very thin and fragile and can rupture easily.The causes of rupture vary and include fluctuations in sys-temic and cerebral blood flow, increases in cerebral bloodflow from hypertension, IV infusions, seizure activity, in-creases in cerebral venous pressure due to vaginal delivery,hypoxia, and respiratory distress. With a preterm birth,the fetus is suddenly transported from a well-controlled uterine environment into a highly stimulating one. Thistremendous physiologic stress and shock may contributeto the rupture of periventricular capillaries and subsequenthemorrhage. Most hemorrhages occur in the rst 72 hoursafter birth (Cunningham et al., 2005). Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage is classi- ed according to a grading system of I to V (least severe tomost severe) (Blackburn, 2007). The prognosis is guarded,depending on the grade and severity of the hemorrhage.Generally, newborns with mild hemorrhage (grades I andII) have a much better developmental outcome than thosewith severe hemorrhage (grades III and IV). Nursing Assessment The signs of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhagevary signicantly; no clinical signs may be evident. Closelymonitor newborns who are at an increased risk, such asthose who are preterm or of low birthweight. Also assessfor risk factors such as acidosis, asphyxia, unstable bloodpressure, meningitis, seizures, acute blood with mechanical ventilation,intubation, apnea, hypoxia, suctioning, use of hyperosmo-712 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK lar solutions, rapid volume expansion, and activities that involve handling. Evaluate the newborn for an unexplained drop in hematocrit, pallor, and poor perfusion as evidenced by res-piratory distress and oxygen desaturation. Note seizures, lethargy or other changes in level of consciousness, weaksuck, high-pitched cry, or hypotonia. Palpate the anteriorfontanel for tenseness. Assess vital signs, noting and hypotension. Evaluate laboratory data for changesindicating metabolic acidosis or glucose instability (Anni-bale & Hill, 2007). Frequently a bleed can progress rapidlyand result in shock and death. Prepare the newborn forcranial ultrasonography, the diagnostic tool of choice todetect hemorrhage. Nursing Management Prevention of preterm birth is essential in preventing periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. Promotecommunity awareness of factors that may contribute toperiventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, such as alack of prenatal care, maternal infection, alcohol con-sumption, and smoking (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Identifyrisk factors that can lead to hemorrhage, and focus careon interventions to decrease the risk of hemorrhage. Forexample, institute measures to prevent perinatal asphyxiaand birth trauma and provide developmental care in theNICU. If a preterm birth is expected, having the motherdeliver at a tertiary care facility with a NICU would bemost appropriate. Care of the newborn with periventricular-intraventric- ularhemorrhage is primarily supportive. Correct anemia, acidosis, and hypotension with fluids and medications.Administer fluids slowly to prevent fluctuations in bloodpressure. Avoid rapid volume expansion to minimizechanges in cerebral blood flow. Keep the newborn in aflexed, contained position with the head elevated to pre-vent or minimize fluctuations in intracranial pressure. Continuously monitor the newborn for signs of hemor-rhage, such as changes in the level of consciousness,bulging fontanel, seizures, apnea, and reduced activitylevel. Also, measure head circumference daily. Minimize handling of the newborn by clustering nurs- ing care, and limit stimulation in the newborn's environ-ment to reduce stress. Also reduce the newborn's exposureto noxious stimuli to avoid a fluctuation in blood pressureand energy expenditure. Provide adequate oxygenation topromote tissue perfusion but controlled ventilation to de-crease the risk of pneumothorax. Support for the parents to cope with the diagnosis and potential long-term sequelae is essential. The long-termneurodevelopmental outcome is determined by the sever-ity of the bleed. Provide education and emotional supportfor the parents throughout the newborn's stay. Discuss ex-pectations for short-term and long-term care needs withthe parents and assist them in obtaining the necessary sup-port from appropriate community resources.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastro- intestinal disease occurring in newborns. It is the mostcommon and most serious acquired gastrointestinal dis- order among hospitalized preterm neonates and is with signicant acute and chronic morbidity andmortality (Wiedmeier, 2008). NEC occurs in 1 to 3 casesper 1,000 live births, affecting 1% to 5% of all newbornsin intensive care units (Stoll & Kliegman, 2007). Ways toimprove gastrointestinal function and reduce the risk ofNEC include enteral (Neu, 2007). Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of NEC is not clearly understood andis thought to be multifactorial in nature. Current researchpoints to three major pathologic mechanisms that lead toNEC: bowel ischemia, bacterial flora, and the effect offeeding (Neu, 2007). During perinatal or postnatal stress, oxygen is shunted away from the gut to more important organs such as theheart and brain. Ischemia and intestinal wall damageoccur, allowing bacteria to invade. High-solute feedingsallow bacteria to flourish. Mucosal or transmucosal necro-sis of part of the intestine occurs (Wood, 2007). Althoughany region of the bowel can be affected, the distal ileumand proximal colon are the regions most commonly in-volved. NEC usually occurs between 3 and 12 days of life,but it can occur weeks later in some newborns. Nursing Assessment NEC can be devastating, and astute assessment is crucial.Assessing the newborn for the development of NEC in-cludes the health history and physical examination as wellas laboratory and diagnostic testing. Health History and Physical Examination Assess the newborn's history for risk factors associatedwith NEC. In addition to preterm birth, prenatal and post-natal predisposing risk factors are highlighted in Box 24.1. Also observe the newborn for common signs and symptoms, which may include: Abdominal distention and tenderness Bloody stools Feeding intolerance, characterized by bilious vomiting Signs of sepsis Lethargy Apnea Shock Always keep the possibility of NEC in mind when dealing with preterm newborns, especially when enteralCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 713 feedings are being administered. Note respiratory dis- tress, cyanosis, lethargy, decreased activity level, tempera-ture instability, feeding intolerance, diarrhea, bile-stainedemesis, or grossly bloody stools. Assess blood pressure, noting hypotension. Evaluate the neonate's abdomenfor distention, tenderness, and visible loops of bowel(Wiedmeier, 2008). Measure the abdominal circumfer-ence, noting an increase. Determine residual gastric vol-ume prior to feeding; when it is elevated, be suspiciousfor NEC. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common laboratory and diagnostic tests ordered for assessment of NEC include: Kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) x-ray: conrms the presence pneumatosis intestinalis (air persistently dilated loops bowel(Srinivasan, Brandler, & 2008; Wood, 2007) Blood values: acidosis, blood cells, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, electrolyte imbalance, or disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIC) Nursing Management Nursing management of the newborn with NEC fo-cuses on maintaining fluid and nutritional status, provid- ing supportive care, and teaching the family about theBOX 24.1 Predisposing Factors for the Development of Necrotizing Enterocolitis Prenatal Factors Preterm labor Prolonged rupture of membranes Preeclampsia Maternal sepsis Amnionitis Uterine hypoxia Postnatal Factors Respiratory distress syndrome Patent ductus arteriosus Congenital heart disease Exchange transfusion Low birthweight Low Apgar scores Umbilical catheterization Hypothermia Gastrointestinal infection Hypoglycemia Asphyxia11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 713condition and prognosis. Therapeutic management ini- tially consists of bowel rest and antibiotic therapy. SerialKUB x-rays are used to assess the resolution or progres-sion of NEC. If medical treatment fails to stabilize thenewborn or if free air is present on a left lateral decubituslm, surgical intervention will be necessary to resect theportion of necrotic bowel. Surgery for NEC usually re-quires the placement of a proximal enterostomy until theanastomosis site is ready for reconnection. Maintaining Fluid and Nutritional Status If NEC is suspected, immediately stop enteral feedingsuntil a diagnosis is made. Administer IV fluids initially torestore proper fluid balance. If ordered, administer totalparenteral nutrition (TPN) to keep the newborn sup-ported nutritionally. Give prescribed IV antibiotics to pre-vent sepsis from the necrotic bowel (if surgery is required,antibiotics may be needed for an extended period). Insti-tute gastric decompression as ordered with an orogastrictube attached to low intermittent suction. Carefully mon-itor intake and output. Restart enteral feedings once thedisease has resolved (normal abdominal examination andKUB negative for pneumatosis) or as determined post-operatively by the surgeon. Providing Supportive Care Manage pain by administering analgesics as ordered. In- fection control is important, with an emphasis on carefulhandwashing. In addition, implement these interventionsin an ongoing manner: Check stools for evidence of blood and report any pos- itive ndings. Measure the abdominal girth. Palpate the abdomen for tenderness and rigidity. Auscultate for normal bowel sounds. Observe the abdomen for redness or shininess, which indicates peritonitis. Teaching the Family The diagnosis of NEC may cause significant family anx- iety. Listen to the family's worries and fears. Answertheir questions honestly. Inform the family that med-ically treated NEC is usually limited to a short periodand resolves within 48 hours of stopping oral feedings,but surgically treated NEC can be a much lengthierprocess. The amount of bowel that has necrosed, as de-termined during the bowel resection, significantly in-creases the likelihood of long-term medical problems.Short bowel syndrome may result from a large resectionof the bowel. Reassure the family that although some in-fants have more involved cases of NEC, the improvedparenteral nutrition formulations have improved theoutcomes for these infants. Provide education aboutostomy care if surgery is required. Promote interactionwith the newborn.714 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK INFANTS OF DIABETIC MOTHERS An infant of a diabetic mother is one born to a woman with pregestational or gestational diabetes (see Chapter 20for additional information). The newborn of a diabeticwoman is at high risk for numerous health-related compli-cations, especially hypoglycemia. In light of the increasingincidence of type 2 diabetes among women of childbearingage, it is important to educate women about the potentialimpact of poor glycemic control on their offspring. Impact of Diabetes on the Newborn For more than a century, it has been known that diabetesduring pregnancy can have severe adverse effects on fetaland newborn outcomes. Infants of diabetic mothers haveincreased morbidity and mortality in the perinatal period.The incidence of major congenital anomalies is muchgreater for these newborns than for other newborns. Poorglycemic control in the rst trimester, during organogen-esis, is thought to be a major reason for congenital mal-formations. The most common types of malformations ininfants of diabetic mothers involve the cardiovascular,skeletal, central nervous, gastrointestinal, and genitouri-nary systems. Cardiac anomalies are the most common(Kwik et al., 2007). Infants of diabetic mothers are longer and weigh more than newborns of similar gestational age. They also haveincreased organ weights (organomegaly) and excessive fatdeposits on their shoulders and trunk, contributing tothe increased overall body weight and predisposing themto shoulder dystocia. These newborns are macrosomic (aninfant whose birthweight exceeds 4,500 g). These over-sized newborns frequently require cesarean births forcephalopelvic disproportion and are often hypoglycemicin the rst few hours after birth. Despite their increased size and weight, they may be remarkably frail, showing behaviors similar to those of apreterm newborn. Thus, birthweight may not be a reli-able criterion of maturity. Newborns of women with dia-betes but without vascular complications often tend to belarge for gestational age (LGA), whereas those of womenwith diabetes and vascular disease are usually small forgestational age (SGA). Pathophysiology The large size of the infant born to a diabetic motheroccurs secondary to exposure to high levels of maternalglucose crossing the placenta into the fetal circulation.Maternal hyperglycemia acts as a fuel to stimulate in-creased production of fetal insulin, which in turn promotessomatic growth within the fetus. The fetus responds tothese high levels by producing more insulin, which acts asa growth factor in the fetus (Blackburn, 2007). How thefetus will be affected and the problems that the newbornexperiences depend on the severity, duration, and controlof the diabetes in the mother. Table 24.1 summarizes the11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 714CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 715 Macrosomia Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) Hypoglycemia Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia PolycythemiaCondition Description Effects Newborn with dened as a birthweight >4,000 g (8 lb 13 oz) to 4,500 g (9 lb 15 oz) or >90%for gestational age Complication in 10% of all pregnancies in the United States Cortisol-induced stimulation of lecithin/ sphingomyelin (phospholipids) necessaryfor within thefetus due to mother's hyperglycemia.

Typical characteristics: - Poor feedings- Jitteriness- Lethargy- High-pitched or Some newborns are asymptomatic.

Infants of diabetic mothers with vascular disease seldom develop RDS because thechronic stress of poor intrauterine perfusionleads to increased production of steroids,which accelerates lung maturation. Low blood glucose levels are problematic during the early post-birth period due toabrupt cessation of high-glucose maternalblood supply and the continuation ofinsulin production by the newborn. Limited ability to release glucagon and cate- cholamines, which normally stimulateglucagon breakdown and glucose release Prolonged and untreated hypoglycemia leads to serious, long-term adverse neurologicsequelae such as learning disabilities andmental retardation. Newborn is at risk for a prolonged delay in parathyroid hormone production and cardiac dysrhythmias.

Nursing Assessment Assessment begins in the prenatal period by identifying women with diabetes and taking measures to control ma-ternal glucose levels (see Chapter 20 for information onmanagement of the pregnant woman with diabetes). Physical Examination At birth, inspect the newborn for these characteristicfeatures: Full rosy cheeks with a ruddy skin color Short neck (some describe \"no-neck\" appearance) Buffalo hump over the nape of the neck Massive shoulders with a full intrascapular area Distended upper abdomen due to organ overgrowth Excessive subcutaneous fat tissue, producing fat extremities (Fig. 24.4) Be alert for hypoglycemia, which may occur immedi- ately or within an hour after birth. Assess blood glucoselevels, which should remain above 40 mg/dL. Closelyassess the newborn for signs of hypoglycemia, includ-ing listlessness, hypotonia, apathy, poor feeding, apneicepisodes with a drop in oxygen saturation, cyanosis, tem-perature instability, pallor and sweating, tremors, irritabil-ity, UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Hyperbilirubinemia Congenital anomaliesCondition Description Effects Usually seen within the rst few days after birth; manifested by a yellow appearanceof the sclera and skin Excessive red cell hemolysis necessary to break down increased RBCs in circulationdue to polycythemia Resultant elevated bilirubin levelsExcessive bruising secondary to birth trauma of macrosomic infants, further adding tohigh bilirubin levels Occur in up to 10% of infants of diabetic mothers, accounting for 30% to 50% ofperinatal deaths Incidence is greatest among small-for- gestational-age newborns. Overall, infants of diabetic mothers have 3 times the usual incidence of congenital anomalies compared to newborns fromthe non-diabetic general population.If untreated, high levels of unconjugated bilirubin may lead to kernicterus (neuro-logic syndrome that results in irreversibledamage) with long-term sequelae that in-clude cerebral palsy, sensorineural hearingloss, and mental retardation.

Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Determine baseline serum calcium, magnesium, andbilirubin levels and monitor them frequently for changes(Table 24.2). Hypocalcemia is typically manifested in therst 2 to 3 days of life as a result of birth injury or a pro-longed delay in parathyroid hormone production. Hypo-magnesemia parallels calcium levels and is suspectedonly when hypocalcemia does not respond to calcium re-placement therapy. Red blood cell breakdown leads toincreased hematocrit and polycythemia. In addition,hyperbilirubinemia may be caused by slightly decreasedextracellular fluid volume, hepatic immaturity, and birthtrauma forming enclosed hemorrhages. It can appear within the first 24 hours of life (pathologic) or after 24 hours of life (physiologic). Nursing Management The focus of care for these infants is early detection and ini-tiation of therapy to address potential problems (NursingCare Plan 24.1). Perform a head-to-toe physical assess-ment to identify congenital anomalies. Institute measuresto hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia,dehydration, and jaundice. Provide oxygenation and venti-latory support as necessary. Preventing Hypoglycemia Prevent hypoglycemia by providing early oral feedingswith formula or breast milk at frequent intervals (every 2to 3 hours). Feedings help to control glucose levels, re-duce hematocrit, and promote bilirubin excretion. Main-tain a neutral thermal environment to avoid cold stress,which may stimulate the metabolic rate, thereby increas-CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 717 ing the demand for glucose. Provide rest periods to de- crease energy demand and expenditure. Monitor blood glucose levels via heel stick every hour for the rst 4 hours of life and then every 3 to 4 hours untilstable. Document the results. Report unstable glucosevalues if oral feedings do not maintain and stabilize thenewborn's blood glucose levels. If glucose levels are notstabilized, initiate IV glucose infusions as ordered and en-sure that the infusions are flowing at the prescribed rate. Maintaining Fluid and Electrolyte Balance Monitor serum calcium levels for changes indicating theneed for supplementation, such as with oral or IV cal-cium gluconate. Assess the newborn for signs of hypocal-cemia, such as tremors, jitteriness, twitching, seizures,and high-pitched cry. Also administer fluid therapy as ordered to maintain adequate hydration. Monitor serum bilirubin levels andinstitute phototherapy if the newborn is over 24 hours old. Providing Parental Support Assist the parents and family in understanding the new-born's condition and need for frequent monitoring. Offersupport and information to the parents and family. Theymay erroneously interpret the newborn's large size as anindication that the newborn is free of problems. Encour-age open communication and listen with empathy to thefamily's fears and concerns. Provide frequent opportuni-ties for the parents to interact with their newborn. Makeappropriate referrals to social services and communityresources as necessary to help the family cope. BIRTH TRAUMA Injuries to the newborn from the forces of labor and birth are categorized as birth trauma. In the past, numerous in-juries were associated with difcult births requiring exter-nal or internal version or mid- or high forceps deliveries.Today, however, cesarean births have contributed to thedecline in birth trauma. Signicant birth trauma accounts for fewer than 2% of neonatal deaths and stillbirths in the United States(Kenner & Lott, 2007). Improved prenatal diagnosis andmonitoring during labor have helped to reduce the inci-dence of birth injuries today. Pathophysiology The process of birth is a blend of compression, contrac-tions, torques, and traction. When fetal size, presentation,or neurologic immunity complicates this process, the forcesof labor and birth may lead to tissue damage, edema, hem-orrhage, or fracture in the newborn. For example, birthtrauma may result from the pressure of 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 717718 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Nursing Care Plan 24.1 OVERVIEW OF THE INFANT OF A DIABETIC MOTHER Jamie, a 38-year-old Hispanic woman, gave birth to a term large-for-gestational-age newborn weighing 10 lb. She had a his- tory of gestational diabetes but had not received any prenatal care. She arrived at the hospital in active labor. Despite macro - somia, the newborn's Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. No resuscitative measures were needed. One hour after birth, assessment revealed a pale, irritable newborn with sweating and several episodes of apnea. A glucose level obtained at this time via a heel stick was 35 mg/dL. Two hours later, the newborn begins exhibiting signs of respiratory distress\u2014grunting, nasal flaring, retractions, tachypnea (respiratory rate 72 breaths/minute), and tachycardia (heart rate 176 b pm). NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for unstable glucose level related to hypoglycemia secondary to intrauterine hyperinsulin state resulting from maternal gestational diabetes as evidenced by low blood glucose level, irritability, pallor, sweating, and apnea Outcome Identication and Evaluation The newborn will exhibit adequate glucose control as evidenced by maintaining blood glucose levels above 40 mg/dL and an absence of clinical signs of hypoglycemia. Interventions: Promoting Glucose Control Monitor blood glucose levels hourly for the rst 4 hours and then every 3 to 4 hours or as necessary to detect hypo- glycemia, which would be <40 mg/dL. Continue to observe for manifestations of hypoglycemia, such as pallor, tremors, jitteriness, lethargy, and poor feeding, to allow for early detection and prompt intervention, thereby minimizing the risk of complications associated with hypoglycemia. Monitor temperature frequently and institute measures to maintain a neutral thermal environment to prevent cold stress, which would increase metabolic demands and further deplete glycogen stores. Initiate early feedings every 2 to 3 hours or as appropriate or administer glucose supplements as ordered to prevent hy- poglycemia caused by the newborn's hyperinsulin state. Administer IV glucose infusions as ordered to correct hypo- glycemia if glucose levels do not stabilize with feeding. Cluster infant care activities and provide for rest periods to conserve the newborn's energy and reduce use of glucose and glycogen stores. Reduce environmental stimuli by dimming lights and speaking softly to reduce energy demands and further utilization of glucose. Explain all events and procedures to the mother to help alleviate anxiety and promote understanding of the newborn's condition. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired gas exchange related to respiratory distress secondary to delayed lung maturity resulting from inhibition of pulmonary surfactant production due to fetal hyperinsulinemia as evidenced by grunting, nasal flaring,retractions, tachypnea, and tachycardia Outcome Identication and Evaluation Newborn will demonstrate signs of adequate oxygenation without respiratory distress as evidenced by respiratory rate and vital signs within acceptable parameters, absence of nasal flaring, retractions, and grunting, and oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas levels within acceptable parameters. Interventions: Promoting Oxygenation Monitor newborn's vital signs to establish a baseline and evaluate for changes. Assess airway patency and perform gentle suctioning as ordered to ensure patency and allow for adequate oxygen intake. Position the newborn prone to optimize respiratory status and reduce stress. Assess lung sounds for changes to allow early detection of change in status. Continuously monitor oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximetry to determine adequacy of tissue perfusion. Assess arterial blood gas results to detect changes indicating acidosis, hypoxemia, or hypercarbia, which would suggest hypoxia. Administer medications as ordered to correct acidosis. Administer oxygen as ordered to promote adequate tissue perfusion. Assess newborn's skin to identify cyanosis, pallor, and mottling to detect changes indicating compromised oxygenation. Administer surfactant replacement therapy as ordered to aid in stabilizing the newborn's lungs until postnatal surfactant synthesis improves. Institute measures to maintain normal blood glucose levels and a neutral thermal environment, cluster care activities,and reduce excessive stimuli to reduce oxygen demand and consumption.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 718a prolonged presen- tation, cephalopelvic disproportion, or mechanical forces,such as forceps or vacuum used during delivery. Table 24.3summarizes the most common types of birth trauma. Nursing Assessment Recognition of trauma and birth injuries is imperative sothat early treatment can be initiated. Review the labor andbirth history for risk factors, such as a prolonged or abruptlabor, abnormal or difcult presentation, cephalopelvicdisproportion, or mechanical forces, such as forceps orvacuum used during delivery. Also review the history formultiple fetus deliveries, large-for-date infants, extremeprematurity, large fetal head, or newborns with congeni-tal anomalies. Complete a careful physical and neurologic assess- ment of every newborn admitted to the nursery to es-tablish whether injuries exist. Inspect the head forlumps, bumps, or bruises. Note if swelling or bruisingcrosses the suture line. Assess the eyes and face for fa-cial paralysis, observing for asymmetry of the face withcrying or appearance of the mouth being drawn to theunaffected side. Ensure that the newborn sponta-neously moves all extremities. Note any absence of ordecrease in deep tendon reflexes or abnormal position-ing of extremities. Assess and document symmetry of structure and function. Be prepared to assist with scheduling diag-nostic studies to confirm trauma or injuries, which willbe important in determining treatment modalities. Nursing Management Nursing management is primarily supportive and fo-cuses on assessing for resolution of the trauma or any as-sociated complications along with providing support andeducation to the parents. Provide the parents with expla-nations and reassurance that these injuries usually re-solve with minimal or no treatment. Parents are alarmedwhen their newborn is unable to move an extremity ordemonstrates asymmetric facial movements. Provideparents with a realistic picture of the situation to gaintheir understanding and trust. Be readily available toanswer questions and teach them how to care for thenewborn, including any modications that might be nec-essary. Allow parents adequate time to understand theimplications of the birth trauma or injury and what treat-ment modalities are needed, if any. Provide them withinformation about the length of time until the injury willresolve and when and if they need to seek further med-ical attention for the condition. Spending time with theparents and providing them with support, information,and teaching are important to allow them to make deci-sions and care for their newborn. Anticipate the need forcommunity referral for ongoing follow-up and care, ifnecessary.CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 719 NEWBORNS OF SUBSTANCE- ABUSING MOTHERS It is generally assumed that all pregnant women want to provide a healthy environment for their unborn child andknow how to avoid harm. However, for women who usesubstances such as drugs or alcohol, this may not be thecase. Substance use during pregnancy exposes the fetus tothe possibility of IUGR, prematurity, neurobehavioral andneurophysiologic dysfunction, birth defects, infections, andlong-term developmental sequelae (Kenner & Lott, 2007). It is difcult to establish the true prevalence of sub- stance use in pregnant women; many women deny takingany nonprescribed substance because of the associatedsocial stigma and legal implications. The National Insti-tute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) suggests that approximately 1 in 10 newborns are exposed to one or more mood-altering drugs in utero (NIDA, 2007f). Drug exposuremay go unrecognized in these newborns, and they maybe discharged from the newborn nursery at risk for med-ical and social problems, including abuse and neglect. Tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana are the substances most commonly abused during pregnancy. Other drugsmay include opioids and nitrous oxide (NIDA,2007f ). Table 24.4 highlights commonly used substancesand their effects on the fetus and newborn. Consider THIS! I admit, I had led a reckless life since I was a teen. I re- belled against my mother's authority and started smok-ing and doing drugs just to \"check out\" of my painful world. It was one big blast after another with a highand then a low. I never considered the consequencesof my behavior then and never thought it would hurtanyone until I learned I was about 4 months preg-nant. I convinced myself that if I cut back, every-thing would be fine. Now, as I stand here in the NICU watching my tiny son struggle for air and tremble all over, I am notso convinced that I didn't hurt anyone except myself.As I witness my son ght against MY nicotine anddrug addiction, my heart is heavy with guilt. I wonderhow I could have thought that my troubles wouldn'tbecome another's plight sooner or later. What must Ihave been thinking to isolate my addiction and notconsider the impact that it would have on my motherand my son?

Erb's palsy is an upper brachial plexus injury. Klumpke's palsy is an injury to the lower brachial plexus(lower brachial injuries areless common). Most common is facial nerve palsy. Frequently attributed to pressure resulting from forceps May also result from pressure on the nerve in utero, relatedto fetal positioning such asthe head lying against theshoulderMid-clavicular fractures: The newborn is irritable and doesnot move the arm on theaffected side either sponta-neously or when the Mororeflex is elicited. Femoral or humeral long bone fractures: The newborn showsloss of spontaneous leg orarm motion respectively; usu-ally swelling and pain accom-pany the limited movement. X-rays conrm the fracture. In Erb's palsy, the involved extremity usually Moro, absent,but the grasp reflex is usuallypresent. Klumpke's palsy is manifested by weakness in the hand andwrist; grasp reflex is absent. Physical ndings include asym- metry of the face when crying;mouth may be drawn towardsthe unaffected side; wrinklesare deeper on the unaffectedside. The paralyzed side maybe smooth, with a swollen ap-pearance. Eye is persistentlyopen on the affected side.Mid-clavicular fractures typically heal rapidly and uneventfully;arm motion may be limited bypinning the newborn's sleeveto the shirt. Femoral and humeral tures are treated with splinting.Healing and complete recov-ery are expected within 2 to 4 weeks without incident(Laroia, 2007). Explanation to the parents and reassurance are needed. Erb's palsy usually involves immobilization of the upperarm across the upperabdomen/chest to protect the shoulder from excessivemotion for the rst week; then gentle passive range-of-motion exercises areperformed daily to preventcontractures. There is usuallyno associated sensory loss,and this condition usuallyimproves rapidly. Treatment for Klumpke's palsy involves placing the hand in a neutral position and usingpassive range-of-motionexercises. In some cases decits may persist, requiring continuingobservation. Most infants begin to recover in the rst week, but full resolu-tion may take up to severalmonths; parents need reas-surance about this. In most cases, treatment is not necessary, only observation. If the eye is affected and unable to close, protection withpatches and synthetic tearsmay be necessary. Parents need instruction about how to feed the newborn,since he or she cannot closethe lips around the nipplewithout having milk seep out.

Cephalhematoma (subperiosteal collection of blood secondaryto the rupture of blood vesselsbetween the skull and perios-teum) occurs in 2.5% of allbirths and typically appearswithin hours after birth (Cunningham et al., 2005). Caput succedaneum (soft tis- sue swelling) is caused byedema of head againstthe dilating cervix during thebirth process. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (one of the most common types ofintracranial trauma) may bedue to hypoxia/ischemia,variations in blood pressure,and the pressure exerted onthe head during labor. Bleed-ing is or cerebellum (mostcommon newborns ofprimaparas and large new-borns, or after an instru-mented birth) are the cause.Increased pressure on theblood vessels inside the skullleads to tears. Depressed skull fractures (rare) may result from the pressureof a forceps delivery; can alsooccur during spontaneous orcesarean may side, over theparietal bone. In caput succedaneum, swelling is not limited by suture lines:it extends across the midlineand is associated with headmolding. It does not usuallycause complications otherthan a misshapen head.Swelling is maximal at birthand rapidly decreases in size.

Thoughts: This woman honestly regrets what her addiction has done to her son as she stands watchinghim go through withdrawal. Her lifestyle choices do affect others, despite her previous denial. One problemwith addiction is the difculty in getting help after deciding to nally quit. There aren't enough rehabcenters to deal with the large numbers needing theirservices and it can be difcult to get into one. Whatcan be offered to pregnant women who abuse sub-stances? How can nurses increase community aware-ness about the impact of this problem, especially during pregnancy?Consider THIS! (continued) Substance abuse during pregnancy is the subject of much controversy. The timing of drug ingestion usually de-termines the type and severity of damage to the fetus. Fre-quently, the woman uses more than one substance, whichcompounds the problem. Nurses must be knowledgeableabout the issues of substance abuse and must be alert foropportunities to identify, prevent, manage, and educatewomen and families about this key public health issue.Fetal Alcohol Syndrome The adverse effects of alcohol consumption have been recognized for centuries, but the associated pattern of fetalanomalies was not labeled until the early 1970s. The dis-tinctive pattern identied three specic and distinctivendings were called fetal alcohol syndrome , character- ized by physical and mental disorders that appear at birthand remain problematic throughout the child's life. How-ever, there are also circumstances in which the effects ofprenatal alcohol exposure are apparent but the newborndoes not meet all of the criteria. In an attempt to includethose who do not meet the strict criteria, the terms \"fetalalcohol effects,\" \"alcohol-related birth defects,\" and\"alcohol-related neurologic defects\" are used to describechildren with a variety of problems thought to be related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The Institutesof Medicine coined the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder as a way of describing the broader effects of pre- natal alcohol exposure. Children with fetal alcohol syn-drome are at the severe end of the spectrum (Manning & Hoyme, 2007). Newborns with some but not all of thesymptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome are described asSubstance Description Effects on Fetus and Newborn Nursing Implications11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 725having alcohol-related birth defects . Fetal alcohol ef- fects may include such problems as low birthweight, devel-opmental delays, and hyperactivity. Box 24.2 summarizesthe manifestations of fetal alcohol syndrome. Worldwide, the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome is 1 to 3 cases per 1,000 live births, and that of fetal alco-hol effects is 3 to 5 per 1,000 live births (March of Dimes,2007a). Current estimates indicate that approximately13% of women of childbearing age are either problemdrinkers or alcoholics; therefore, the number of fetusesexposed to alcohol during utero increases dramatically(March of Dimes, 2007a). Fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the most common known causes of mental retardation, and it is the onlycause that is entirely preventable. The effects last a life-726 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK time. Children with this syndrome have varying degrees of psychological and behavioral problems and oftenfind it difficult to hold a job and live independently(CDC, 2007b). Decreasing or eliminating alcohol consumption dur- ing pregnancy is the only way to prevent fetal alcoholsyndrome and fetal alcohol effects. Unfortunately, fewtreatment programs address the needs of pregnant women,so many newborns are exposed to alcohol in utero. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Newborns of women who abuse tobacco, illicit sub-stances, caffeine, and alcohol can exhibit withdrawalbehavior. Withdrawal symptoms occur in 60% of allnewborns exposed to drugs (Arenson & Drake, 2007).Drug dependency acquired in utero is manifested by aconstellation of neurologic and physical behaviors andis known as neonatal abstinence syndrome . Although often treated as a single entity, neonatal abstinence syn-drome is not a single pathologic condition. The mani-festations of withdrawal are a function of the drug's half-life, the specific drug or combination of drugs used, dosage, route of administration, timing of drug expo-sure, and length of drug exposure (Kuschel, 2007).Typical newborn (Marcellus, syndromehas both medical and developmental consequences forthe newborn. Nursing Assessment Several assessment tools can be used to assess a drug-exposed newborn. Figure 24.5 shows an example. Regard-less of the tool used for assessment, address these key areas: Maternal history to identify risk behaviors for sub- stance abuse: Previous unexplained fetal demise Lack of prenatal care History of missed prenatal appointments Severe mood swings Precipitous labor Poor nutritional status Abruptio placentae Hypertensive episodes History of drug abuse Laboratory test results (toxicology) to identify sub- stances in mother and newborn Signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome (use the \"WITHDRAWAL\" acronym; see description below) Evidence of seizure activity and need for protective environment The newborn's behavior often prompts the health care provider or nurse to suspect intrauterine drug expo-sure (Box 24.3).

Most pregnant women are unaware of the adverse impact their substance abuse can have on the newborn. Nurses are in a unique position to help because they interact with high-risk mothers and newborns in manysettings, including the community, health care facilities,and family agencies. It is the responsibility of all nursesto identify, educate, counsel, and refer pregnant womenwith substance-abusing problems. For example, nursescan be instrumental in increasing the number of pregnantwomen who make a serious attempt to quit smoking byusing the \"5 A's\" approach: Ask: Ask all women if they smoke and would like to quit. Advise: Encourage the use of clinically proven treatment plans. Assess: Provide motivation by discussing the \"5 R's\": Relevance of quitting to the woman Risk of continued smoking to the fetus Rewards of quitting for both Roadblocks to quitting Repeat at every visit Assist: Help the woman to protect her fetus and new- born from the negative effects of smoking. Arrange: Schedule follow-up visits to reinforce the woman's commitment to quit. Although this approach is geared to smoking cessa- tion, nurses can adapt it to focus on cessation for any sub-stance use. Early, supportive, ongoing nursing care iscritical to the well-being of the mother and her newborn. Caring for a substance-exposed newborn remains a major challenge to health care professionals. The majorgoals include providing comfort to the newborn by reliev-ing symptoms, improving feeding and weight gain, prevent-ing seizures, promoting mother-newborn interactions, andreducing the incidence of newborn mortality and abnormaldevelopment (Belik & Hawes, 2007). Promoting Comfort Keep environmental stimuli to a minimum. For example,decrease stimuli by dimming the lights in the nursery, andswaddle the newborn tightly to decrease irritability behav-iors. Other techniques such as gentle rocking, using a flexedposition, and offering a pacier can help manage CNS irri-tability. A pacier also helps satisfy the newborn's need fornonnutritive sucking. Use a calm, gentle approach whenhandling the newborn and plan activities to avoid overstim-ulating the newborn, allowing time for rest periods. Meeting Nutritional Needs When feeding the newborn, use small amounts and posi-tion the newborn upright to prevent aspiration and to fa-cilitate rhythmic sucking and swallowing. Breastfeedingis encouraged unless the mother is still using drugs. Mon-itor the newborn's weight daily to evaluate the successof food intake. Assess hydration; check skin turgor andfontanels. Assess the frequency and characteristics ofCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 729 bowel movements and monitor the newborn's fluid and electrolyte and acid-base status. Preventing Complications Pharmacologic treatment is warranted if conservativemeasures, such as swaddling and decreased environmen-tal stimulation, are not adequate. The AAP recommendsthat for newborns with conrmed drug exposure, drugtherapy is indicated if the newborn has seizures, diarrhea,and vomiting resulting in excessive weight loss and dehy-dration, poor feeding, inability to sleep, and fever unre-lated to infection (AAP Committee on Substance Abuse,2005). Common medications used in the management ofnewborn withdrawal include morphine, paregoric, phe-nobarbital, tincture of opium, methadone, clonidine,chlorpromazine, and diazepam (Marcellus, 2007). Ad-minister the prescribed medications and document thenewborn's behavioral responses. The newborn is at risk for skin breakdown. Weight loss, diarrhea, dehydration, and irritability can contributeto this risk. Provide meticulous skin care and protect thenewborn's elbows and knees against friction and abrasions. Promoting Parent-Newborn Interaction For a mother who abuses substances, the birth of a drug-exposed newborn is both a crisis and an opportunity. Themother may feel guilty about the newborn's condition.Many of these newborns are unresponsive and have dis-organized sleeping and feeding patterns. When awake,they can be easily overstimulated and irritated. Such char-acteristics make parent-newborn interactions difcult andfrustrating, leading to possible detachment and avoidance(Burd, 2007). In addition, the mother may be single anda victim of physical and sexual abuse and may have a lim-ited support system. Many of these mothers may have hadpoor parenting themselves, lack information about char-acteristic infant behaviors, and have unrealistic expecta-tions about the newborn's abilities (Goff & O'Connor,2007). Instruct the mother or caretaker how to care forthe newborn, including what to do after the newborn goeshome (Teaching Guidelines 24.1). On the other hand, the newborn may be a powerful motivator for the mother to undergo treatment and seekrecovery. Refer the mother to community agencies to ad-dress her addiction and the infant's developmental needs(Gilbert, 2007). The nurse can play a pivotal role in assist-ing her to abstain from drug use and to promote effectiveparenting skills. HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA Hyperbilirubinemia is a total serum bilirubin level above 5 mg/dL resulting from unconjugated in the skin membranes11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 Page 729(Blackburn, 2007). Hyperbilirubinemia is jaundice (yellowing of the body tissues and fluids).Newborn jaundice is one of the most common reasonsfor hospital readmission. It occurs in 60% to 80% ofterm newborns in the first week of life and in virtuallyall preterm newborns (Fanaroff & Lissauer, 2008). Pathophysiology Newborn jaundice results from an imbalance in the rateof bilirubin production and bilirubin elimination. This730 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK imbalance determines the pattern and degree of newborn hyperbilirubinemia (Blackburn, 2007). During the newborn period, a rapid transition from the intrauterine to the extrauterine pattern of bilirubin phys-iology occurs. Fetal unconjugated bilirubin is normally cleared by placenta and the mother's liver in utero, sototal bilirubin at birth is low. After the umbilical cord is cut,the newborn must conjugate bilirubin (convert a lipid-soluble pigment into a water-soluble pigment) in the liveron his or her own. The rate and amount of bilirubin conju-gation depend on the rate of red blood cell breakdown, thebilirubin load, the maturity of the liver, and the number ofalbumin-binding sites (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Bilirubinproduction increases after birth mainly because of a short-ened red blood cell lifespan (70 days in the newborn vs.90 days in the adult) combined with an increased red bloodcell mass. Therefore, the amount of bilirubin the newbornmust deal with is large compared to that of an adult. Bilirubin has two forms\u2014unconjugated or indirect, which is fat-soluble and toxic to body tissues, and conju-gated or direct, which is water-soluble and nontoxic. Ele-vated serum bilirubin levels are manifested as inthe newborn. Typically the total serum bilirubin level risesover the rst 3 to 5 days and then declines. Physiologic Jaundice Physiologic jaundice is the manifestation of the normalhyperbilirubinemia seen in newborns, appearing during thethird to fourth days of life, due to the limitations and abnor-malities of bilirubin metabolism. It occurs in 60% of terminfants up to 80% of preterm infants Serum bilirubin levels reach up to 10 mg/dL andthen decline rapidly over the rst week after birth (Cun-ningham et al., 2005). Most newborns have been dis-charged by the time this jaundice peaks (at about 72 hours). Physiologic jaundice may result from an increased bilirubin load because of relative polycythemia, a short-ened red blood cell lifespan, immature hepatic uptakeand conjugation process, and increased enterohepaticcirculation (McLenan, 2007). Newborns with delayedpassage of meconium are to develop physio-logic 2007). Physiologic jaundice differs between breastfed and bottle-fed newborns in relation to the onset of symptoms.Breastfed newborns typically have peak bilirubin levelson the fourth day of life; levels for bottle-fed newbornsusually peak on the third day of life. The rate of bilirubindecline is less rapid in breastfed newborns compared tobottle-fed newborns because bottle-fed newborns tend tohave more frequent bowel movements. Jaundice associ-ated with breastfeeding practices because of rela-TEACHING GUIDELINES 24.1 Caring for Your Newborn at Home Position your newborn with the head elevated to prevent choking. To aid your newborn's sucking and swallowingduring feeding, position the chin downward andsupport it with your hand. Place your newborn on his or her back to sleep ornap, never on the stomach. Keep a bulb syringe close by to suction your new-born's mouth in case of choking. Cluster newborn care (bathing, feeding, dressing)to prevent overstimulation. If your newborn is fussy or crying, try these measuresto help calm him or her: Wrap your newborn snugly in a blanket and gentlyrock in rocking chair. Take the baby for a ride in the car (using a new born car seat). Play soothing music and \"dance\" with the new born. Use a wind-up swing with music. To help your newborn get to sleep, try these measures: Schedule a bath with a gentle massage prior tobedtime. Change diaper and clothes to make the baby comfortable. Feed the baby just prior to bedtime. If the newborn cries when put in crib and allneeds are met, allow him or her to cry. Use a rocking chair to feed and sing a soft lullaby. Call your primary care provider if you observe with-drawal behaviors such as: Slight tremors (shaking) of hands and legs Stiff posture when held in your arms Irritability and frequent fussiness High-pitched cry, excessive sucking motions Erratic sleep pattern Frequent yawning, nasal stufness, sweating Prolonged time needed to feed Frequent vomiting after feeding 11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 730tive caloric deprivation in the rst few days of life. De- creased volume and frequency of feedings may result inmild dehydration and the delayed passage of meconium.This delayed defecation allows enterohepatic circulationreuptake of bilirubin and an increase in the serum level ofunconjugated bilirubin. To prevent this, strategies to pro-mote early effective breastfeeding are important. TheAAP guidelines recommend early and frequent breast-feeding without supplemental water or dextrose-waterunless medically indicated (AAP, 2005). Early frequentfeedings can provide the newborn with adequate caloriesand fluid volume (via colostrum) to stimulate peristalsisand period, with the bilirubin level usually peaking in the6th to 14th day of life. Total serum bilirubin levels may be12 to 20 mg/dL, but the levels are not considered patho-logic (Simpson, 2007). The specic cause of late-onsetbreast milk jaundice is not entirely understood, but it maybe related to a change in the milk composition resulting inenhanced enterohepatic circulation. Additional research isneeded to determine the cause. Interrupting breastfeedingis not recommended unless bilirubin levels reach danger-ous levels; if this occurs, breastfeeding is stopped for only1 or 2 days. Substituting formula during this short breakusually results in a prompt decline of bilirubin levels. Pathologic Jaundice Pathologic jaundice is manifested within the rst 24 hours of life when total bilirubin levels increase by more than5 mg/dL/day and the total serum bilirubin level is mg/dL in a full-term infant (Ozen & Mukherjee,2007). Conditions that alter the production, transport,uptake, metabolism, excretion, or reabsorption of biliru-bin can cause pathologic jaundice in the newborn. A fewconditions that contribute to red blood cell breakdownand thus higher bilirubin levels include polycythemia,blood incompatibilities, and systemic acidosis. TheseCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 731 altered conditions can lead to high levels of unconjugated bilirubin, possibly reaching toxic levels and resulting in asevere condition called kernicterus. Kernicterus (yellow nucleus) disorder abnormalities, hearing andvision loss, and death (Maisels & Newman, 2007). Neuro-toxicity develops because unconjugated bilirubin has ahigh afnity for brain tissue, and bilirubin not bound to al-bumin is free to cross the blood-brain barrier and damagecells of the CNS. In the acute stage, the newborn becomes lethargic, irritable, and hypotonic and sucks poorly. If the hyper-bilirubinemia is not treated, the newborn becomes hyper-tonic, with arching and seizures. A high-pitched cry maybe noted. These changes can occur rapidly, so all new-borns must be assessed for jaundice and tested if indicatedso that treatment can be initiated. The most common condition associated with patho- logic jaundice is hemolytic disease of the newborn sec-ondary to incompatibility of blood groups of the motherand the newborn. The most frequent conditions are Rhfactor and ABO incompatibilities. Signicant jaundice in a newborn less than 24 hours of age should be immedi- ately reported to the physician, as it may indicate apathologic process.Take NOTE! Rh IsoimmunizationRh incompatibility or woman who has experienced Rh isoimmuniza-tion subsequently becomes pregnant with an Rh-positivefetus. The maternal antibodies cross the placenta into thefetal circulation and begin to break down the red blood cells(Fig. 24.6). Destruction of the fetal red blood cells leads to A B C + - - + + + + + - - + + + + + + - - + + + Subsequent Rh + fetus FIGURE24.6 Rh isoimmunization. (A) The Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive antigens.(B) Maternal antibodies form. (C) Rh antibodies are transferred to the fetus.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 731fetal anemia and hemolytic disease of the newborn. The severity of the fetal hemolytic process depends on the leveland effectiveness of anti-D antibodies and the capacity ofthe fetal system to remove antibody-coated cells. Intrauterine transfusions with Rh-negative, type O blood may be life-saving if done in time. The widespreadadministration of Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM),combined with aggressive fetal surveillance and trans-fusion, has reduced the incidence of hemolytic diseaseof the newborn. Immune hydrops, also called hydrops fetalis, is a se- vere form of hemolytic disease of the newborn that occurswhen pathologic changes develop in the organs of thefetus secondary to severe anemia. Hydrops fetalis resultsfrom fetal hypoxia, anemia, congestive Rh incompatibilities can both cause hydrops fetalis,but Rh disease is the more common cause. Typically, hy-drops is not observed until the hemoglobin drops belowapproximately 4 g/dL (hematocrit <15%) (Huang et al.,2007). Fetuses with hydrops may die in utero from pro-found anemia and circulatory failure. The placenta isvery enlarged and edematous. One sign of severe anemiaand impending death is the sinusoidal fetal heart rate pat-tern (Cunningham et al., 2005). ABO Incompatibility ABO incompatibility is an immune reaction that occurswhen the mother has type O blood and the fetus has typeA, B, or AB blood. Although it occurs more frequentlythan Rh incompatibilities, it causes less severe problemsand rarely results in hemolytic disease severe enough tobe clinically diagnosed and treated. Enlargement of thespleen and liver may be found in newborns with ABO in-compatibility, but hydrops fetalis is rare (Kenner & Lott,2007). Because the antibodies resulting in ABO incom-patibility occur naturally, it is impossible to eliminate thistype of incompatibility. Women with type O blood develop anti-A or anti-B antibodies throughout their life through foods they eat andexposure to infections. Most species of anti-A and anti-B antibodies are immunoglobin M (IgM), which cannotcross the placenta and thus cannot gain access to thefetal red blood cells. Some anti-A and anti-B antibodiesfrom the mother may cross the placenta to the fetus dur-ing the first pregnancy and can cause hemolysis of fetalblood cells. Nursing Assessment Nurses play an important role in early detection andidentication of jaundice in the newborn. Keen observa-tion skills are essential. Health History and Physical Examination Review the history for factors that might predispose thenewborn to hyperbilirubinemia, such as:732 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Polycythemia Signicant bruising or cephalhematoma, which increases bilirubin production Infections as TORCH (toxoplasmosis, hepatitis B, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus) Use of drugs during labor and birth such as diazepam (Valium) or oxytocin (Pitocin) Prematurity Gestational age of 34 to 36 weeks Hemolysis due to ABO incompatibility or Rh iso- immunization Macrosomic infant of a diabetic mother Delayed cord clamping, which increases the erythro- cyte volume Decreased albumin binding sites to transport unconju- gated bilirubin to the liver because of acidosis Delayed meconium passage, which increases the amount of bilirubin that returns to the unconjugatedstate and can be absorbed by the intestinal mucosa Siblings who had signicant jaundice Inadequate breastfeeding leading to dehydration, decreased caloric intake, weight loss, and delayed passage of meconium Ethnicity, such as Asian-American, Mediterranean, or Native American Male gender (Kenner & Lott, 2007) Perform a complete physical examination. Assess the skin, mucous membranes, sclerae, and bodily fluids (tears,urine) for a yellow color. Detect jaundice by observing theinfant in a well-lit room and blanching the skin with digi-tal pressure over a bony prominence. Typically, jaun-dice begins on the head and gradually progresses to the abdomen and extremities. Also inspect for pallor (anemia),excessive bruising (bleeding), and dehydration (sluggishcirculation), which may contribute to the development ofjaundice and the risk for kernicterus. Assess the newborn for Rh incompatibility. Be alert for clinical manifestations such as ascites, congestive heartfailure, edema, pallor, 2007). The hydropic newborn appears pale, edematous, and limp at birth and typically requires resuscitation. Thenewborn with immune hydrops exhibits severe general-ized edema, organ and enlargement, and ef-fusion of fluid into body cavities. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Determine maternal and fetal blood types, checking for incompatibilities (Comparison Chart 24.1). Assess lab-oratory values for bilirubin (both unconjugated andconjugated). Bilirubin levels establish the diagnosis ofhyperbilirubinemia. The newborn with Rh incompatibil-ity demonstrates a rapidly rising unconjugated bilirubinlevel at birth or in the rst 24 hours. Also expect to obtain11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 732alkaline phosphatase, liver enzymes, and prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, as well as: Direct Coombs test\u2014to identify hemolytic disease of the newborn; positive results indicate that the new-born's red blood cells have been coated with anti-bodies and thus are sensitized Hemoglobin concentration\u2014for evidence of anemia Blood type\u2014to determine Rh status and any incom- patibility of the newborn Total serum protein\u2014to detect reduced binding capacity of albumin Reticulocyte count\u2014to identify an elevated level indicating increased hemolysis Assist with obtaining blood specimens. Use cord blood for hemoglobin concentration measurements; usea heel stick for direct Coombs testing and bilirubin lev-els. Prepare the parents and newborn for radiologic eval-uation if necessary to determine abnormalities that maybe causing the jaundice. Nursing Management Nursing management of a newborn with hyperbilirubine-mia requires a comprehensive approach. As members ofthe health care team, nurses share in the responsibility forearly detection and identication, family education, man-agement, and follow-up of the mother and newborn.Documentation of the timing of onset of jaundice is es-sential differentiate between hours) jaundice. Nurses can im-prove care by offering their presence and support. Reducing Bilirubin Levels Encourage early initiation of feedings to prevent hypo-glycemia and provide protein to maintain the albuminlevels to transport bilirubin to the liver. Ensure newbornfeedings (breast milk or formula) every 2 to 3 hours topromote prompt emptying of bilirubin from the bowel.Encourage the mother to breastfeed (8 to 12 feedings perday) to prevent inadequate intake and thus dehydration.Supplement breast milk with formula to supply protein ifbilirubin levels continue to increase with breastfeedingCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 733 only. Monitor serum bilirubin levels frequently to reduce the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia. Phototherapy For the newborn with jaundice, regardless of its etiology,phototherapy is used to convert unconjugated bilirubinto the less toxic water-soluble form that can be excreted.Phototherapy, via special lights placed above the new-born or a ber-optic blanket placed under the newbornand wrapped around him or her, involves blue wave-lengths of light to alter unconjugated bilirubin in the skin.For the newborn receiving phototherapy, place the new-born under the lights or on the beroptic blanket, expos-ing as much skin as possible. Cover the newborn's genitalsand shield the eyes to protect them from becoming irri-tated or burned when using direct lights. Assess the inten-sity of the light source to prevent burns and excoriation(Fig. 24.7). Turn the newborn every 2 hours to maximizethe area of exposure, removing the newborn from thelights only for feedings. Maintain a neutral thermal envi-ronment to decrease energy expenditure, and assess thenewborn's neurologic status frequently. Assess the newborn's temperature every 3 to 4 hours as indicated. Monitor fluid intake and output closely andassess daily weights for gains or losses. Check skin turgorfor evidence of dehydration. With feedings, remove the newborn from the lights and remove the eye shields to allow interaction with thenewborn. Encourage breast or bottle feedings every 2 to3 hours. Follow agency policy about removing the eyeshields periodically to assess the eyes for discharge orcorneal irritation secondary to eye shield pressure. Typi-cally, the eyes are assessed and eye shields are removedonce a shift. Monitor stool for consistency and frequency. Un- conjugated bilirubin excreted in the feces will produce agreenish appearance, and typically stools are loose. Lackof frequent green stools is a cause for concern. Provide meticulous skin care. Assess skin surfaces fre- quently for dryness and irritation secondary to the dehy-drating effects of phototherapy and irritation from highlyacidic stool to prevent excoriation and skin breakdown(Simpson, 2007). Monitor the newborn's skin turgor.Clinical Picture Rh Incompatibility ABO Incompatibility First-born Rare Common Later pregnancies More severe No increase in severityJaundice Moderate to severe MildHydrops fetalis Frequent RareAnemia Frequently severe RareAscites Frequent RareHepatosplenomegaly 24.1 S. ABO I NCOMPATIBILITY11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 733Exchange Transfusion If the total serum bilirubin level remains elevated afterintensive phototherapy, an exchange transfusion, thequickest method for lowering serum bilirubin levels, maybe necessary (Springer & Annibale, 2007). In the pres-ence of hemolytic disease, severe anemia, or a rapid risein the total serum bilirubin level, an exchange transfusionis recommended. An exchange transfusion removes thenewborn's blood and replaces it with nonhemolyzed redblood cells from a donor. During the transfusion, moni-tor the newborn's cardiovascular status continuously be-cause serious complications can arise, such as acid-baseimbalances, infection, hypovolemia, and fluid and elec-trolyte imbalances. Exchange transfusion is used only asa second-line therapy after phototherapy has failed toyield results. Intensive nursing care is needed. Assist the physician with an exchange transfusion if necessary. Monitor the newborn's status closely forchanges, especially in vital signs and heart rate and rhythm,before, during, and after the procedure. Providing Parent Teaching and Support Nurses can help the parents to understand the diagnostictests and treatment modalities by offering individualizedteaching. Explore with the family their understanding of734 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK jaundice and treatment modalities to reduce anxiety and gain their cooperation in monitoring the infant. Teach theparents about jaundice and its potential risk using writtenand verbal material. Also show the parents how to iden-tify newborn behaviors that might indicate rising bilirubinlevels. Emphasize the need to seek treatment from theirpediatrician should any of the following occur: Lethargy, sleepiness, poor muscle tone, floppiness Poor sucking, lack of interest in feeding High-pitched cry Teach the parents how to assess their newborn for signs of jaundice because physiologic jaundice may notoccur until after the newborn is discharged. Reinforce theneed for appropriate follow-up with the primary careprovider within 48 to 72 hours after discharge to assessjaundice status (Keren & Bhutani, 2007). The need for phototherapy can be anxiety-producing for the parents. Explain the rationale for the procedureand demonstrate techniques that the parents can use tointeract with their newborn. Additional education aboutphototherapy may be necessary when home photother-apy is used (Teaching Guidelines 24.2). NEWBORN INFECTIONS Newborns are susceptible to infections because their immune system is immature and slow to react. The anti-bodies that newborns received from the mother duringpregnancy and from breast milk help protect them frominvading organisms. However, these need time to reachoptimal levels. Bacterial infections of the newborn affect approxi- mately 4 out of every 1,000 live births (McLenan, 2007).Making the diagnosis of sepsis in newborns is difcultdue to its nonspecic symptoms. The mortality rate fromnewborn sepsis may be as high as 50% if untreated. In-fection is a major cause of death during the rst month oflife, contributing to 13% to 15% of all neonatal deaths(Anderson-Berry & Bellig, 2007). Pathophysiology When a pathologic organism overcomes the newborn'sdefenses, infection and sepsis results. Neonatal sepsis is the presence of bacterial, fungal, or viral microorganismsor their toxins in blood or other tissues. Infections thathave an onset within the rst month of life are termednewborn infections. Exposure to a pathogenic organism,whether a virus, fungus, or bacteria, occurs, and it entersthe newborn's body and begins to multiply. Newborn infections are usually grouped into three classes according to their time of onset: congenital infec-tion, acquired in utero (intrauterine infections) by verti-cal transmission with onset before birth; early-onset FIGURE24.7 A newborn receiving phototherapy. Here the nurse is checking the intensity of the lights with a meter.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 734infections, acquired by vertical transmission in the peri- natal period, either shortly before or during birth; andlate-onset infections, acquired by horizontal transmis-sion in the nursery. As many as 80% to 90% of neonatal infections have their onset in the rst 2 days of life(Rubarth, 2008). Comparison Chart 24.2 compares the three classes of newborn infections. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment focuses on early identication of a newborn at risk for infection to allow for prompt treat-CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 735 ment, thus reducing mortality and morbidity. Be aware of the myriad risk factors associated with newborn sepsis.Among the factors that contribute to the newborn's over-all vulnerability to infection are poor skin integrity, in-vasive procedures, exposure to numerous caregivers,and an environment conducive to bacterial coloniza-tion (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Few newborn infections are easy to recognize because manifestations usually are nonspecic. Early symptomscan be vague because of the newborn's inability to mountan inflammatory response. Often, the observation is thatthe newborn does not \"look right.\" Assess the newborn forcommon Pallor flaring Apnea and bradycardia Lethargy Hypoglycemia Poor feeding (lack of interest in feeding) Abdominal distention (Anderson-Berry & Bellig, 2007) Since infection can be confused with other new- born conditions, laboratory and radiographic tests areneeded to confirm the presence of infection. Be pre-pared to coordinate the timing of the various tests andassist as necessary. Evaluate the complete blood count with a differential to identify anemia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia. ElevatedC-reactive protein levels may indicate inflammation. Asordered, obtain x-rays of the chest and abdomen, which may reveal infectious processes located there. Blood,cerebrospinal fluid, and urine cultures are indicated toidentify the location and type of infection present. Posi-tive cultures conrm that the newborn has an infection. Nursing Management To enhance the newborn's chance of survival, early recog- nition and diagnosis are key. Often the diagnosis of sepsisis based on a suspicious clinical picture. Antibiotic therapyis usually started before the laboratory results identify theinfecting pathogen (see Evidence-Based Practice 24.1).Along with antibiotic therapy, circulatory, respiratory, nu-tritional, and developmental support is important. Anti-biotic therapy is continued for 7 to 21 days if cultures are positive, or it is discontinued within 72 hours if culturesare negative. With the use of antibiotics along with earlyrecognition and supportive care, mortality and morbidityrates have been reduced greatly.TEACHING GUIDELINES 24.2 Caring for Your Newborn Receiving Home Phototherapy Inspect your newborn's skin, eyes, and mucous membranes for a yellow color. Remember that a home health nurse will come tovisit and help you set up the light system. Keep the lights about 12 to 30 inches above yournewborn. Cover your newborn's eyes with patches or cottonballs and gauze to protect them. Keep the newborn undressed except for the diaperarea; fold the diaper down below the newborn'snavel in the front and as far as possible in the backto expose as much skin as possible. Turn your newborn every 2 hours so that all areasof the body are exposed. Remove the newborn from the lights only for feeding. Remove the eye patches during feedings so that youcan interact with your newborn. Record your newborn's temperature, weight, andfluid intake daily. Document the frequency, color, and consistency ofall stools; the stools should be loose and green asthe bilirubin is broken down. Keep the skin clean and dry to prevent irritation. Feed your newborn frequently, including supple-mental glucose water if allowed to provide addedfluid, protein, and calories. Rock, cuddle, or hold the newborn to promotebonding when out of the lights. Contact your pediatrician or home health careagency with any questions or changes, including refusing feedings, fewer than ve wet diapers in oneday, vomiting of complete amounts of feeding, orelevated temperature. Keep appointments for follow-up laboratory testingto monitor bilirubin levels. 11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 735Nurses possess the education and assessment tools to decrease the incidence of and reduce the impact of in-fections on women (see Chapter 20 for additional infor-mation) and their newborns. Implement measures forprevention and early recognition, including: Formulating a sepsis prevention plan that includes education of all members of the health care team onidentication and treatment of sepsis Screening all newborns daily for signs of sepsis Monitoring sepsis cases and outcomes to reinforce continued quality-improvement measures or to modifycurrent practices Outlining and carrying out measures to prevent noso- comial infections, such as:736 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Thorough handwashing hygiene for all staff Frequent oral care and inspections of mucous membranes Proper positioning and turning to prevent skin breakdown Use of strict aseptic technique for all wound care Frequent monitoring of invasive catheter sites for signs of infection Identifying newborns at risk for sepsis by reviewing risk factors Monitoring vital sign changes and observing for subtle signs of infection Monitoring for signs of organ system dysfunction: Cardiovascular compromise\u2014tachycardia and hypotensionIntrauterine (Congenital) Early-Onset Infections Late-Onset Infections Risk factors Common causativeorganisms Mechanism of infection- Immature immune system IgM, IgA, and T lymphocytes - Decreased gastric acid, which is needed to reduce organisms - Cytomegalovirus - Rubella- Toxoplasmosis- Syphilis - Organism crossing placenta into fetal circulatory system; organ-ism residing in amniotic fluid - Ascent of organism via the vagina, ultimately infectingmembranes and causing ruptureand leading to respiratory andgastrointestinal tract infectionsCOMPARISON CHART 24.2 INTRAUTERINE VS . albicans - Coagulase-negative - Enterobacter- Klebsiella- Serratia- Pseudomonas- Group B streptococci More common in newborns undergoing invasive proce-dures such as endotrachealintubation or catheter insertion;break in skin or mucosal protection barrier- rupture of Prolonged Maternal fever- Colonization with group B streptococci - Maternal infections - Escherichia coli - Group B occur during birthing process when newborn comesinto contact with infected birthcanal (newborn cannot defendagainst host organisms). - Newborn susceptibility to infec- tion by exogenous organismspossibly due to inadequacy ofphysical barriers (thin, friable skinwith little subcutaneous tissue) - Lack of gastric acidity, possibly resulting in easy colonization byenvironmental organisms - Aspiration of microorganisms during birth with Sources: Renal compromise\u2014oliguria or anuria Systemic compromise\u2014abnormal blood values Providing comprehensive sepsis treatment: Circulatory support with fluids and vasopressors Supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation Obtaining culture samples as requested Antibiotic administration as ordered, observing for side effects Promoting newborn comfort Assessing the family's educational needs and provid- ing instructions as necessary Perinatal infections continue to be a public health problem, with severe consequences for those affected.

Primary disease pre- vention must be a major focus for nurses. Family edu-cation plays a key role in the prevention of perinatalinfections, in addition to following accepted practices inimmunization. Congenital Conditions Congenital conditions can arise from many etiologies, in-cluding single-gene disorders, chromosome aberrations,exposure to teratogens, and many sporadic conditions ofunknown cause. Congenital conditions may be inheritedor sporadic, isolated or multiple, apparent or hidden, grossor microscopic. They cause nearly half of all deaths in termnewborns and cause long-term sequelae for many. The in-cidence varies according to the type of defect. When a se-rious anomaly is identied prenatally, the parents candecide whether or not to continue the pregnancy. When ananomaly is identied at or after birth, parents need to beinformed promptly and given a realistic a ppraisal of the severity of the condition, the prognosis, and treatmentRao, S. C., Ahmed, M., & Hagan, R. (2006). One dose per day compared to multiple doses per day of gentamicin for treatment of suspected or proven sepsis in neonates. Cochrane Database of System- atic Reviews 2006. Issue 1. Art. No.: CD005091.Sepsis in a newborn can be fatal, and the signs and symp- toms can be vague. Antibiotic therapy is usually initiatedbefore the infection is conrmed by cultures. Gentamicin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat neonatal sepsis because it is effective against gram-negative pathogens.However, gentamicin, like other aminoglycosides, canhave adverse effects on hearing and kidney function, lead-ing to questions about the most effective dosing regimen.Studies have shown that once-a-day dosing is most effec-tive in older children and adults, but these studies do notaddress the neonatal population. Study A study involving neonates with conrmed or suspectedsepsis was completed to evaluate the effectiveness andsafety two involving a comparisonof one daily dose with multiple doses per day of gentamicinto newborns less than 28 days of age were selected. Infor-mation about clinical effectiveness, pharmacokinetic effec-tiveness, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity was collected. Ofthe 24 studies initially selected, 11 were evaluated. Most ofthe studies used intravenous infusion of gentamicin as themethod of administration. One study used a bolus dose ofgentamicin administered over 1 minute; two other studies used intramuscular administration. Findings Regardless of the dosing regimen, gentamicin was shown to be effective in treating the sepsis. The once-daily dosingregimen appeared to be more effective: appropriate peakand trough levels of the drug were obtained more fre-quently when compared to the multiple-dose regimen. Thestudies found no evidence of ototoxicity or nephrotoxicitywith either regimen. Nursing Implications The study conrmed the effectiveness of gentamicin in thetreatment of neonatal sepsis, but it did not determinewhether a once-daily dose was more effective than multi-ple doses per day in treating sepsis. Nurses can integratethe ndings of this study into their practice when caring fornewborns who are at risk for or have developed sepsis.Regardless of the regimen ordered, nurses can be diligentin ensuring that peak and trough drug levels are monitored.Although the study showed no evidence of hearing andkidney adverse effects, nurses still need to monitor thenewborns for this possibility.

Congenital conditions can affect virtually any body system. This chapter describes common congenital condi-tions identied at or after birth. Some of these conditionswarrant immediate treatment soon after birth. Other con-ditions, although identied in the newborn period, arelong-term with ongoing effects into childhood. CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE Congenital heart disease is a structural defect involving the heart, the great vessels, or both that is present at birth(American Heart Association [AHA], 2008a, 2008b). Itis a broad term that can describe a number of abnormali-ties affecting the heart. Approximately 8 newborns out ofevery 1,000 live births will have some form of congenitalheart disease. Congenital heart disease causes more deathsduring the rst year of life than any other birth defect(AHA, 2008a). The defect may be very mild and the new-born appears healthy at birth, or it may be so severe that thenewborn's life is in immediate jeopardy. Severe congeni-tal cardiac defects usually present in the rst few days orweeks of life, while the newborn's circulation is continu-ing to adapt to the demands of extrauterine life. Advancesin diagnosis and medical and surgical interventions haveled to dramatic increases in survival rates for newbornswith serious heart defects. Pathophysiology In most cases, the exact cause of congenital heart diseaseis unknown. Most congenital heart defects develop dur-ing the rst 8 weeks of gestation and are usually the resultof genetic and environmental forces. Typically, congenital heart disease is divided into four physiologic categories based on structural abnormal-ities and functional alterations (Table 24.5): Defects causing increased pulmonary blood flow, such as atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect Defects causing obstructed blood flow out of the heart, such as pulmonary or aortic stenosis Defects causing decreased pulmonary blood flow, such as tetralogy of Fallot Defects involving mixing of saturated and desaturated blood, such as truncus arteriosus or transposition ofthe great arteries These four categories are more descriptive than the system used previously, which classied the disorder onlyas cyanotic or acyanotic. This previous because some with \"acyanotic\" de-fects developed cyanosis and delayed symptoms thatoften became apparent during infancy and early child-738 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK hood. With the hemodynamic classication, the clinical picture of each grouping is more uniform and predictable(Simpson & Creehan, 2008). Therapeutic Management If the defect is mild, typically no treatment is necessary.However, for most congenital defects corrective surgeryis necessary. Nursing Assessment While most congenital heart defects cannot be prevented,several key areas need to be addressed to ensure the op-timal health status for the woman and her fetus. A thor-ough health history of the woman and newborn andphysical examination provide valuable information. Lab-oratory and diagnostic tests provide additional informa-tion about the defect and its severity. Health History and Physical Examination Ideally, nursing assessment begins prenatally by re-viewing the maternal history for risk factors that mightpredispose the newborn to a congenital heart defect.Risk factors include: Maternal alcoholism Maternal diabetes mellitus Single-gene mutation or chromosomal disorders Maternal exposure to x-rays Maternal exposure to rubella infection Poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy Maternal age over 40 Maternal use of amphetamines Genetic factors (family recurrence patterns) Maternal metabolic disorder of phenylketonuria Maternal use or isotretinoin(Accutane) After birth, carefully assess the newborn's cardio- vascular and respiratory systems, looking for signs of res- piratory distress, cyanosis, or congestive heart failure thatmight indicate a cardiac anomaly. Assess rate, rhythm,and heart sounds, reporting any abnormalities immedi-ately. Note any signs of heart failure, including edema,diminished peripheral pulses, hepatomegaly, tachycardia, diaphoresis, respiratory distress with tachypnea, peripheralpallor, and irritability (Kenner & Lott, 2007). Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Assist with diagnostic testing, such as: Arterial blood gases to determine oxygenation levels and to differentiate lung disease from heart disease asthe cause of cyanosis Chest x-rays to identify cardiac size, shape, and position11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 738 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for cardiac malformations Electrocardiogram to detect atrial or ventricular hypertrophy and dysrhythmias Echocardiogram to evaluate heart anatomy and flow defects Blood studies to assess anemia, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels Catheterization to obtain data for denitive diagnosis or in preparation for cardiac surgeryCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 739 Nursing Management Like nursing assessment, nursing management ideally fo- cuses on prevention with measures during the prenatalperiod. For example, ensure that all women are tested priorto pregnancy for immunity to rubella so that they can beimmunized if necessary.

Referthe woman and her partner for genetic counseling if car-diac defects are present in the family to provide the parentswith a risk assessment for future offspring. Some defects can be discovered on routine prenatal ultrasound. Therefore, stress the importance of receivingprenatal care throughout pregnancy so that appropriateinterventions can be initiated early if the need arises. After birth of the newborn, nursing management fo- cuses on ensuring adequate cardiac functioning. Providecontinuous monitoring of the newborn's cardiac andrespiratory status. Administer medications as ordered.Provide comfort measures to the newborn who will besubjected to a variety of painful procedures. Be vigilant inensuring the newborn's comfort, since he or she cannotreport or describe pain. Assist in preventing pain as muchas possible; interpret the newborn's cues suggesting painand manage it appropriately. Include the parents in the plan of care. Assess their ability to cope with the diagnosis, encouraging them to ver-balize their feelings about the newborn's condition andtreatment. Educate them about the specic cardiac defect;include written information and pictures to enhance under-standing. Present an overview of the prognosis and pos- sible interventions. Teach them about the medications prescribed, including side effects and doses, and how toobserve for signs and symptoms indicating heart failure. Assist them with making decisions about treatment, and support their decisions for the newborn's care. If sur-gical correction is planned, provide the parents with pre-operative teaching and orient them to the NICU prior tosurgery. Provide emotional support and guidance through-out the newborn's care. The parents also need clear instructions about how to monitor the newborn at home, especially if the new-born will be discharged and then brought back later sothe condition can be corrected. The parents also need in-structions about caring for their newborn after the defectis corrected. Educate the parents about signs that need tobe reported, such as weight loss, poor feeding, cyanosis,breathing difculties, irritability, increased respiratoryrate, and fever. Referrals to local support groups, nationalorganizations, and websites also are helpful. Emphasizethe importance of close supervision and follow-up care. NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS Neural tube defect (NTD) is the common name used to describe congenital CNS structural defects. NTDs areserious malformations involving the spine bida)and brain (anencephaly). In the United States, NTDs af-fect 0.6 per 1,000 live births; approximately 3,000 preg-nancies annually are complicated by NTDs (Jallo &740 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Bescke, 2007). They are the second most common major congenital anomaly worldwide, behind cardiac malfor-mations (CDC, 2008a). A worldwide decline in NTDs has occurred over the past few decades as a result of prevention (preconceptionfolic acid supplementation and monitoring of maternalserum alpha-fetoprotein levels) and use of ultrasonographyand amniocentesis to identify affected fetuses (Blackburn,2007). Despite this decline, still more infants could beborn free of these birth defects if all women consumed thenecessary amount of folic acid (CDC, 2008a). Pathophysiology NTDs occur when the neural tube that develops into the brain and spinal cord fails to close properly during earlyembryogenesis. The neural tube normally closes betweenthe 17th and 30th day of gestation. NTDs develop dur-ing this rst month, when most women are still unawareof their pregnancy and the embryo is estimated to beabout the size of a grain of rice. In pregnancies in whichthe fetus has a NTD, the level of alpha-fetoprotein in theamniotic fluid and maternal serum is elevated. NTDs involve abnormalities in the region-specific neural tube closure junctions with the cranial and caudallevels of the neural tube. NTDs may be either closed(covered by skin or a membrane) or open (neural tissueexposed). These defects vary in their severity, dependingon the type and level of the lesion. defect, is the congenital absence of the cranial vault, with the cerebralhemispheres completely missing or reduced to smallmasses. It most commonly involves the forebrain and vari-able amounts of the upper brain stem, where there is nobrain tissue above the brain stem. The incidence is approx-imately 0.2 per 1,000 live births, and both genetic and en-vironmental insults appear to be responsible (Best, 2007).Anencephaly is apparent on visual inspection after birth,with exposed neural tissue without a cranium surroundingit. Prenatally, alpha-fetoprotein levels are elevated late inthe rst trimester. Most newborns with anencephaly arestillborn; those born alive die within a few days. Spina Bida Spina bida is a general term used to refer to caudal de- fects (below the level of T12) involving spinal cord tissue.Spina bida is the leading cause of infantile paralysis inthe world today; incidence rates are about 1 per 1,000 livebirths (Foster, 2007). Spina bida may be classied by the degree of spinal cord involvement as spina bida occulta or spinal bidacystica (Fig. 24.8). Spina a defect11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 740in the vertebrae without any protrusion or herniation of the spinal cord or meninges. It is a closed defect and isnot visible externally. A hairy patch, dermal sinus tract,dimple, hemangioma, or lipoma may be noted tho-racic, lumbar, or sacral area. Spina bida cystica is a NTD. It in- cludes meningocele and myelomeningocele. Meningo- cele, a less severe form of spina bida cystica, is an opening in the spine through a bony defect (spina bida)where a herniation of the meninges and spinal fluid hasprotruded. The spinal cord and nerve roots do not herni-ate into this dorsal dural sac. Surgical treatment to closethe defect is usually warranted. A myelomeningocele is a more severe form of spina bida cystica in which the spinal cord and nerve rootsherniate into the sac through an opening in the spine,compromising the meninges. It is the most common form,accounting for 94% of cases (Behrman et al., 2007). Theincidence is 1 in 1,200 to 1,400 live births; it affects 6,000to 11,000 newborns in the United States each year (Jallo& Becske, 2007). This complex condition, resulting froma neurodevelopmental disruption early in gestation, af-fects not just the spine but also the CNS. Hydrocephalusfrequently accompanies this anomaly (Ellenbogen, 2006).This protrusion is typically covered partially or com-pletely by skin but is very fragile and may leak CSF iftraumatized.CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 741 Therapeutic Management No immediate treatment is needed for spina bifida occulta. However, surgical intervention may be neces-sary later in life to treat complications associated withdegenerative changes or spinal or nerve root involve-ment. For meningocele, surgery is performed to closethe defect. For myelomeningocele, surgical repair iscompleted as soon as possible, usually within 72 hoursafter birth, to prevent infection and preserve neurologicfunction (Ellenbogen, 2006). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment focuses on prevention. Assess all women of childbearing age for intake of folic acid and theuse of folic acid supplementation. Review a pregnantwoman's history for this supplementation throughout thepregnancy. In addition, monitor the pregnant woman'sserum alpha-fetoprotein levels as indicated during preg-nancy. Be alert for genetic and environmental risk factorsassociated with myelomeningocele, such as: Celtic ancestry (highest incidence) Female sex (accounting for 60% to 70% of affected newborns) Low socioeconomic status Maternal diabetes Use of anticonvulsants (valproic acid and carbamazepine) Previous newborn with a NTD Maternal obesity Maternal malnutrition Low folic acid intake (Cunningham et al., 2005) Inspect the newborn for abnormalities of the spine and back. Look for dimpling or a tuft of hair, which wouldsuggest spina bifida occulta. Observe for a protrusionalong the back that may be partially or completely cov-ered with skin. Note the head circumference: a newborn AB C D FIGURE24.8 Neural tube defects. ( A) Normal spine. occulta. ( C) Meningocele. (D) Myelomeningocele. Myelomeningoceles can arise at any point along the vertebral column, but they most commonly occur in the lower lumbar or sacral regions,causing neurologic decits below the level of the defect.Paralysis, bladder and bowel incontinence, and hydro-cephalus are the 3:07 PM Page 741Infants with myelomeningocele are at increased risk for latex allergy due to their repeated and numerous exposures to products containinglatex during surgery and other necessary treatments.Take NOTE! with myelomeningocele often exhibits hydrocephalus (Fig. 24.9).742 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK In addition, ensure a neutral thermal environment and avoid hypothermia. Heat can be lost through the de-fect opening, placing the newborn at increased risk forcold stress. Assess movement and sensation below the defect; also assess urinary and bowel elimination, which may beaffected based on the level of the lesion. Measure headcircumference daily to observe for hydrocephalus. FIGURE24.9 A newborn with myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus. Newborns with meningocele usually have normal examination ndings and a covered (closed) dural sac. They typically do not have associatedneurologic malformations.Take NOTE! Nursing Management Nursing management of the newborn with spina bidaocculta is primarily supportive. Be sure that the parentsunderstand the term used and that they do not confusetheir newborn's condition with a more serious form ofNTD. Teach them about the possibility of surgery in thefuture should complications develop. For the child with meningocele, closely monitor the skin covering the area for evidence of CSF leakage. Preparethe newborn and parents for surgery. Nursing management for a newborn with myelo- meningocele involves the following actions to reduce therisk of infection: Use strict aseptic technique when caring for the defect to prevent infection. Avoid trauma to the sac (to prevent leakage of CSF or damage to the nerve tissue) through prone or side-lying positioning. Apply a sterile dressing or protective covering over the sac to prevent rupture and drying, with frequent changes toprevent the dressing from adhering to the defect. Frequently monitor the sac for signs of oozing fluid or drainage. Meticulously clean the genital area to avoid contami- nation of the sac.Provide support and information to help the parents cope. Allow them to verbalize their feelings and ask ques-tions. Encourage open discussions regarding the baby'sprognosis and long-term care. Provide education about thecare of the newborn, including measures to reduce the riskof infection and trauma to the sac. Encourage the parentsto participate in their newborn's care as much as possible.As necessary, refer the parents to a support group. MICROCEPHALY Microcephaly is a condition in which a small brain is lo- cated within a normal-sized cranium. This implies neu-rologic impairment. Diagnosis is conrmed by a CT scanor MRI. Care is supportive since there is no known treat-ment to reverse the disorder. Risk factors for this anomalyinclude maternal viral infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella,cytomegalovirus, herpes, and diabetes, exposure,and malnutrition (DeVries, 2007). Inform parents aboutthe potential cognitive impairment of their newborn. En-sure that appropriate community referrals are made toassist the parents and the child, who will have develop- mental delays. HYDROCEPHALUS Hydrocephalus is an increase in CSF in the ventricles of the brain due to overproduction or impaired circula-tion and absorption. The term stems from the Greekwords hydro (water) and kephale (head). It occurs in about 3 or 4 per 1,000 live births (Engelhart & Sahraker,2007).11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 742Pathophysiology Congenital hydrocephalus usually arises as a result of a malformation in the brain or an intrauterine infection (toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus). Hydrocephalus rarelyoccurs as an isolated defect; it is usually associated withspina bida or other neural tube anomalies. Normal growthof the brain is altered secondary to the increase in intra-cranial pressure from the CSF. Therapeutic Management No treatment is available that can counteract the accu- mulation of CSF in the brain. Therefore, surgery with theinsertion of a ventricular shunt is the mainstay of treat-ment to relieve pressure within the cranium. Shunts aredesigned to maintain normal intracranial pressure bydraining CSF. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt isinserted from the ventricle in the brain and threadeddown into the peritoneal cavity to allow drainage of ex-cess CSF. The long-term prognosis for this conditionvaries and depends on the patency of the shunt, the pres-ence of other CNS anomalies and their impact on thenewborn, and the quality of care the newborn receives.However, shunting has dramatically improved the out-come of newborns with hydrocephalus (Kramer, 2007). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment focuses on obtaining a health history and performing a physical examination. Be alert for riskfactors in the maternal history such as intrauterine infec-tion or preterm birth. Assess the infant's head circumfer-ence and note any increases. Also note any visible scalpveins (Fig. 24.10). Palpate the infant's head, noting anywidened sutures and wide, opened fontanels. Typicallythe fontanels will feel tense and bulging. Also observe forother signs of hydrocephalus, including poor feeding,\"setting sun\" eyes, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability. ACT scan or MRI conrm the diagnosis.CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 743 Nursing Management Prior to shunt insertion, nursing management focuses on daily documentation of the newborn's head circumfer-ence and associated neurologic behaviors that might in-dicate an increase in intracranial pressure: irritability,high-pitched cry, poor feeding and sucking, vomiting, ordecrease in consciousness. Gently palpate the fontanelsfor bulging and tenseness, and palpate the suture lines forincreasing separation. Protect the enlarged head to pre-vent skin breakdown. Handle the head gently and use asheepskin or a waterbed or egg-crate mattress. Changethe newborn's position frequently to minimize pressure. Postoperatively, strictly monitor the newborn's neu- rologic status and behavior and report any changes thatmight indicate increased intracranial pressure secondaryto a blockage pressure placespressure the oculomotor nerve, producing dilation),increasing head size, bulging fontanels, and change inlevel of consciousness. Assess the abdomen for disten-tion because drainage of CSF into the abdomen cancause peritonitis. Paralytic ileus is another possible post-operative complication due to distal catheter placement(Engelhart & Sahraker, 2007). After surgery, continue to provide protective and comfort measures for the enlarged head. Position thenewborn's head so that he or she does not lie on the shuntarea. Educate the parents about caring for the shunt andsigns of infection or blockage. A referral for follow-uphome care is appropriate. CHOANAL ATRESIA Choanal atresia is an uncommon congenital malformation of the upper airway that involves a narrowing of the nasalairway due to membranous or bony tissue. It can be unilat-eral or bilateral and typically presents with other anomaliesinvolving the heart and CNS. It occurs in 1 in 8,000 livebirths, with a female preponderance (Tewk, 2007). The cause of this congenital defect is unknown, but it is thought to result from persistence of the membranebetween the nasal and oral spaces during fetal develop-ment. During attempted inspiration, the tongue is pulledto the palate and obstruction of the oral airway results. Ifthe newborn cries and takes a breath through the mouth,the airway obstruction is momentarily relieved. When thecrying stops, however, the mouth closes and the cycle ofobstruction is repeated (Tewk, 2007). This structuralanomaly can result in signicant respiratory distress inthe newborn. If the nasal airway is completely obstructed,death from asphyxia may occur at birth. Inability to pass a suction catheter through the nose into the pharynx is highly suggestive of choanal atresia. hydrocephalus.11223-24_CH24.qxd PM Page 743Other signs include respiratory distress, cyanosis unless newborn is crying, and inability to suck and breathe simul-taneously. The diagnosis can be conrmed with a CT scan.Surgery to remove the obstruction and establish a patentairway is needed. Full recovery is the usual outcome. CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a (1 in 3,000 newborns) that frequently presentswith signicant respiratory distress in the immediatenewborn period (Datin-Dorriere et al., 2008). Most her-nias (85%) involve the left hemidiaphragm (Beck et al.,2008). CDH is associated with other anomalies, includ-ing congenital cardiac defects, genital or renal anomalies,NTDs, choanal atresia, or chromosomal anomalies, suchas trisomy 13 and 18. The survival rate of newborns witha diaphragmatic hernia varies widely. Pathophysiology It is thought that the diaphragm failed to close properlyduring early embryonic development. The abdominalcontents herniated into the thoracic cavity through adefect in the diaphragm (Fig. 24.11). The timing of theherniation and the amount of abdominal contents inthe thoracic cavity greatly influence the clinical pictureat birth and the survival rate. The presence of the ab-dominal contents in the chest compresses the lung,leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, and promotes persis-tent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (Datin-Dorriere et al., 2008).744 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Nursing Assessment Assess the newborn closely for evidence of respiratory distress, including cyanosis. Affected newborns presentwith profound respiratory distress because at least one ofthe lungs cannot expand or may not have fully developed,resulting in persistent pulmonary hypertension shortlyafter birth. If present, institute resuscitation measuresimmediately. Inspect the chest and abdomen, noting a barrel- shaped chest and scaphoid-shaped abdomen. Duringauscultation, note absent breath sounds on the affectedside of the chest and heart sounds displaced to the right.Also listen for bowel sounds, which would be heard inthe chest. Prepare the newborn for a chest x-ray, which will reveal evidence of air-filled bowel in the chest. Diaphragm Abdominal contents Lung FIGURE24.11 Congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Note how some of the abdominal contents have entered the thoracic cavity,compressing the lung. Prenatal diagnosis of CDH is possible through ultrasound. This diagnosis should be considered when hydramnios is present.Take NOTE! Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on maintaining optimal res- piratory function until surgery is performed to correct thedefect. Assist with endotracheal intubation and positive-pressure ventilation to aid in lung expansion and improve-ment of ventilation. Position the newborn on the affected side with the head and chest elevated to promote normallung expansion. Monitor ventilatory pressures to preventpneumothorax. If a pneumothorax occurs, assist with in-sertion of a chest tube. Monitor oxygen saturation levelsto evaluate systemic perfusion status. If the infant's con-dition does not stabilize, anticipate use of extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) or high-frequency os-cillatory ventilation. Administer prescribed medications as ordered. For ex- ample, give inotropics to support systemic blood pressure.Administer surfactant, steroids, and inhaled nitric oxide asordered to correct hypoxia and acid-base imbalance. Monitor vital signs, weight, urinary output, and serum electrolytes to identify changes early. Maintain nothing bymouth (NPO) status to prevent aspiration, and ensure aneutral thermal environment to prevent cold stress and re-duce oxygen demands. Minimize environmental stimulito reduce agitation and oxygen demand. Assist with place-ment of an orogastric tube for gastric decompression. Provide the parents with continuing updates about the newborn's condition. Encourage the parents to seeand touch the infant frequently to promote bonding. As-11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 744sist parents with identifying newborn cues and respond- ing to them. CLEFT LIP AND PALATE A cleft lip involves a congenital ssure or longitudinal opening in the lip; a cleft palate involves a congenital s-sure or longitudinal opening in the roof of the mouth.The defect may be limited to the outer flesh of the upperlip or it may extend back through the midline of the upperjaw through the roof of the palate. It may occur as a sin-gle defect or part of a syndrome of anomalies. It can beunilateral or bilateral. Unilateral cleft lip occurs morecommonly on the left side. Bilateral cleft lip is usually ac-companied by a cleft palate. Cleft palate can range froma cleft in the uvula to a complete cleft in the soft and hardpalates that can be unilateral, bilateral, or in the midline(Fig. 24.12). Cleft lip and palate is the most common craniofacial birth defect. It is more common in white and Asianmales. In addition to immediate feeding difculties, in-fants with cleft lip and palate may have problems withdentition, language acquisition, and hearing (March ofDimes, 2008a). Therapeutic Management Repairing the facial anomaly as soon as possible is impor- tant to facilitate bonding between the newborn and theparents and to improve nutritional status. Treatment ofcleft lip is surgical repair between the ages of 6 to 12 weeks.Successful surgery often leaves only a thin scar on theupper lip. The outcome of surgery depends on the sever-ity of the defect: children with more severe cases will needadditional surgery in stages (March of Dimes, 2008a). Surgical correction for cleft palate is done around 6 to 18 months of age to allow for developmental growthCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 745 to occur. A plastic palate guard to form a synthetic palate may need to be used to allow for introduction of solidfoods and to prevent aspiration in the interim. Nursing Assessment Obtain a thorough maternal history, noting the presenceof any risk factors such as maternal use of phenytoin (Di-lantin), alcohol, and retinoic acid (Accutane) and ciga-rette smoking. Also assess for a family history of cleft lipor palate, which increases the risk. Inspect the lip for a visible deformity. Inspect and palpate the mouth for an opening, which may be small orinvolve the entire palate. Also observe for any feeding dif-culties, which are common in newborns with cleft lipand palate. FIGURE24.12 A newborn with a cleft lip. The defect may extend up through the roof of the palate. Milk flow during feeding requires negative pressure and sucking pressure. Newborns with cleft lip and palate have feeding difculties becausethey cannot generate a negative pressure in the mouthto facilitate sucking (Vieira, 2008). Use special nipples,bottles, and feeders to help meet the nutritional needs ofinfants with this anomaly.Take NOTE! Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on providing adequate nutri-tion, promoting parental bonding, and providing parentaleducation. Providing Adequate Nutrition Feed the infant in an upright position to prevent aspira- tion, and assess for achievement of adequate suction dur-ing feeding. Use high-calorie formula to improve caloricintake. Burp the infant frequently to reduce the risk forvomiting and aspiration; burp him or her in the sittingposition on your lap to prevent trauma to the mouth onyour shoulder. Limit feeding sessions to avoid poor weightgain due to fatigue. After feeding, position the newbornon his or her side in an infant seat. Promoting Parental Bonding On rst glance, parents may be upset with the appearance of their newborn. Encourage the parents to express theirfeelings about this highly visible anomaly. Emphasize thenewborn's positive features and role-model nurturing be-haviors when interacting with the infant. Encourage par-ents to interact with the newborn. Provide support to theparents, especially related to feeding difculties. Allowthem to vent their frustrations. Offer practical sugges-tions and continued encouragement for their efforts.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 745Providing Parental Education Outline treatment modalities and explain the staging of surgical interventions. Show the family photos taken be-fore and after surgical repair in other babies. These pho-tos can alleviate some of their anxiety. Plan for dischargeas soon as the parents feel comfortable with infant care.As part of the discharge plan, initiate appropriate refer-rals for community support and counseling as needed(Kenner & Lott, 2007). ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA AND TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA Esophageal atresia and anomalies in which the esophagus andtrachea do not separate normally during embryonic de-velopment. endsdo the upper esophageal segmentends in a blind pouch and the lower segment ends avariable distance above the diaphragm (Fig. 24.13).Tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormal communica-tion between the and esophagus. When associ-ated with esophageal atresia, the stula most commonly occurs between the distal esophageal segment and the tra-chea. The incidence of esophageal atresia is 1 per 3,000 to4,000 live births (Blackburn, 2007). Pathophysiology Several types of esophageal atresia exist, but the mostcommon anomaly is a stula between the distal esophagusand the trachea, which occurs in 86% of newborns withan esophageal defect. Esophageal atresia and tracheo-esophageal stula are thought to be the result of incom-plete separation of the lung bed from the foregut duringearly fetal development. A large percentage of thesenewborns have other congenital anomalies involvingthe vertebrae, kidneys, heart, and musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal systems (CDC, 2008b). Most newborns have several anomalies. Nursing Assessment Review the maternal history for polyhydramnios. Often this is the rst sign of esophageal atresia because the fetus can-not swallow and absorb amniotic fluid in utero, leading toaccumulation. Soon after birth, the newborn may exhibitcopious, frothy bubbles of mucus in the mouth and nose,accompanied by drooling. Abdominal distention developsas air builds up in the stomach. In esophageal atresia, a gas-tric tube cannot be inserted beyond a certain point becausethe esophagus ends in a blind pouch. The newborn mayhave rattling respirations, excessive salivation and drooling,746 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK and \"the three C's\" (coughing, choking, and cyanosis) if feeding is attempted. The presence of a stula increases therisk of respiratory complications such as pneumonitis andatelectasis due to aspiration of food and secretions (Kenner& Lott, 2007). The \"three C's\" of choking, coughing, and cyanosis in conjunction with feeding are considered the classic signs of tracheoesophagealstula and atresia.Take NOTE! Prepare the newborn and parents for radiographic evaluation. Diagnosis is made by x-ray: a gastric tube ap-pears coiled in the upper esophageal pouch, and air in thegastrointestinal tract indicates the presence of a stula(Kenner & Lott, 2007). Once a diagnosis of esophagealatresia is established, begin preparations for surgery if thenewborn is stable. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on preparing the newbornand parents for surgery and providing meticulous post-operative care. Providing Preoperative Care Preoperative nursing interventions include the following measures: Initiate nothing by mouth (NPO) status. Elevate the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees to prevent reflux and aspiration. Monitor hydration status and fluid and electrolyte balance; administer and monitor parenteral IV fluidinfusions. Assess and maintain the patency of the orogastric tube. Monitor the functioning of the tube, which is attached to low continuous suction. Avoid irrigation of the tube to prevent aspiration. Have oxygen and suctioning equipment readily available should the newborn experience respiratorydistress. Assist with diagnostic studies to rule out other anomalies. Use comfort measures to minimize crying and prevent respiratory distress; provide nonnutritive sucking. Inform the parents about the rationales for the aspiration prevention measures. Document frequent observations of the newborn's condition (Kenner & Lott, 2007).11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 746Providing Postoperative Care Surgery consists of closing the fistula and joining the two esophageal segments. Postoperative care involvesclosely observing all of the newborn's body systems toidentify any complications. Expect to administer TPNand antibiotics until the esophageal anastomosis is provenintact and patent. Then begin oral feedings, usuallywithin a week after surgery (Blackburn, 2007). Keepthe parents informed of their newborn's condition andprogress. Closely assess the newborn during feeding andreport any difficulty with swallowing. Provide parentCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 747 teaching. Demonstrate and reinforce all teaching prior to discharge. OMPHALOCELE AND GASTROSCHISIS Omphalocele and gastroschisis are congenital anomalies of the anterior abdominal wall.

( D) The upper portion of the esophagusconnects to the trachea via a fistula.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 747abdominal contents into an external peritoneal sac. Defects vary in size; they may be limited to bowel loops or may in-clude the entire gastrointestinal tract and liver (Fig. 24.14).Bowel malrotation is common, but the displaced organs areusually normal. Omphaloceles are associated with otheranomalies in more than 70% of the cases. This anomalyis usually detected during routine prenatal ultrasound ofthe fetus or during investigation of an increased alpha-fetoprotein level (Glasser, 2007). Gastroschisis is a herniation of the abdominal con- tents through an abdominal wall defect, usually to the leftor right of the umbilicus (McLenan, 2007). Gastroschi-sis differs from omphalocele in that there is no peritonealsac protecting the herniated organs, and thus exposureto amniotic fluid makes them thickened, edematous,and inflamed. Gastroschisis is associated with signicantnewborn mortality and morbidity rates. Despite surgicalcorrection, feeding intolerance, failure to thrive, and pro-longed hospital stays occur in nearly all newborns withthis anomaly (Henrich et al., 2008). Each of these diagnoses requires that a pediatric sur- geon be available at delivery to determine the extent ofthe defect and complications. Nursing Assessment Review the maternal history for factors associated withhigh-risk pregnancies, such as maternal illness and infec-tion, drug use, smoking, and genetic abnormalities.These factors are also associated with omphalocele and gastroschisis. They contribute to placental insufciencyand the birth of a small-for-gestational-age or pretermnewborn, the populations in which both of these abdomi-nal defects most commonly occur. The combined inci-dence of both congenital abdominal wall anomalies is 1 in2,000 births (Glasser, 2007).748 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK Omphalocele and gastroschisis are readily observed. Note the appearance of the protrusion on the abdomenand evidence of a sac. Inspect the sac closely for the pres-ence of organs, most commonly the intestines but some-times the liver. Also inspect the contents for any twistingof the intestines. Note the color of the organs within thesac and measure the size of the omphalocele. Also perform a complete physical examination of the newborn. Typically these congenital conditions are asso-ciated with other congenital anomalies, such as those in-volving the cardiovascular, genitourinary, and centralnervous systems. Nursing Management Nursing management of newborns with omphalocele orgastroschisis focuses on preventing hypothermia, main-taining perfusion to the eviscerated abdominal contentsby minimizing fluid loss, and protecting the exposed ab-dominal contents from trauma and infection. These ob-jectives can be accomplished by placing the infant in asterile drawstring bowel bag that maintains a sterile envi-ronment for the exposed contents, allows visualization,reduces heat and moisture loss, and allows heat from ra-diant warmers to reach the newborn. The newborn isplaced feet-rst into the bag and the drawstring is securedaround the torso (McLenan, 2007). Strict sterile tech-nique is necessary to prevent contamination of the ex-posed abdominal contents. An orogastric tube attached to low suction is used to prevent intestinal distention. IV therapy is administered tomaintain fluid and electrolyte balance and provide a routefor antibiotic therapy. Monitor the newborn's fluid statusfrequently. Closely observe the exposed bowel for vascu-lar compromise, such as changes in color or a decrease intemperature, and report these immediately. Providing Postoperative Care Surgical repair of both defects occurs after initial stabiliza- tion and comprehensive evaluation for any other anom-alies. It may have to occur in stages, depending on thedefect (Box 24.4). Postoperative care involves providing pain manage- ment, monitoring respiratory and cardiac status, monitor-ing intake and output, assessing for vascular compromise,maintaining the orogastric tube to suction, document-ing the amount and color of drainage, and administer-ing ordered medications and treatments (Lund, Bauer,& Berrios, 2007). Also be alert for complications, such as short bowel syndrome. Promoting Parent-Newborn Interaction The parents need continued support and progress reportson their newborn. They may be distraught at the sight ofthe anomaly, and they may be frightened to touch theirnewborn. Encourage the parents to touch the newborn FIGURE24.14 Omphalocele in a newborn. Note the large, protruding sac.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 748and participate in care as much as possible. Because of the nature of this defect, bonding opportunities will be limitedinitially. However, strongly encourage frequent visiting.In addition, provide information to the parents aboutthe defect, treatment modalities, and prognosis. Aftersurgery, instruct the parents in care measures and givethem care instructions. Anticipate the need for a refer-ral to a home health care agency and community re-sources for support. IMPERFORATE ANUS An imperforate system malfor- of the anorectal area that may occur in severalforms. The rectum may end in a blind pouch that doesnot connect to the colon, or it may have fistulas (open-ings) between the rectum and the perineum, the vaginain girls or the urethra in boys (Fig. 24.15). The malfor-mations occur during early fetal development and areassociated with anomalies in other body systems. Imperforate anus occurs in about 1 of every 5,000 live births (March of Dimes, 2006). The defect can be furtherclassied as a high or low type, depending on its level.The level signicantly influences fecal continence andmanagement (Rosen & Beals, 2007). Surgical intervention is needed for both high and low types of imperforate anus. Surgery for a high type of de-fect involves a colostomy in the newborn period, with cor-rective surgery performed in stages to allow for growth.Surgery for the low type of anomaly, which frequently in-cludes a stula, involves closure of the stula, creation ofan anal opening, and repositioning of the rectal pouchCHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 749 into the anal opening. A major challenge for either type of surgical repair is nding, using, or creating adequate nerveand muscle structures around the rectum to provide fornormal evacuation. Nursing Assessment In the newborn, observe for an appropriate anal open-ing. If the anal opening exists, observe for passage ofmeconium stool within the rst 24 hours of life. Assessurine output to identify genitourinary problems. For thenewborn with an imperforate anus, inspection of the per-ineal area would reveal absence of the usual opening,and meconium generally is not passed or present within24 hours of birth. In the infant with suspected imperforate anus, assess for common signs of intestinal obstruction, which mayoccur as a result of the malformation. These includeabdominal distention and bilious vomiting. Prepare the newborn and family for radiographic studies that may be ordered to assess for complicationsassociated with imperforate anus. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on preparing the newbornand parents for surgery and providing postoperative care.Preoperatively, maintain the newborn's NPO status andprovide gastric decompression. Administer IV therapyand antibiotic therapy as ordered and monitor the new-born's hydration status. Provide a full explanation of thedefect, surgical options, potential complications, typicalpostoperative course, and long-term care needed to theparents. Make sure they are aware of the available treat-ment modalities. Prepare them for the possibility that thenewborn may require an ostomy. Provide support to theparents and family.BOX 24.4 Surgery to Repair Omphalocele and Gastroschisis Surgical repair of gastroschisis is an emergency due to the high risk of intestinal atresia, resulting in obstruc-tion. Primary repair of gastroschisis is usually performedwithout incident unless the contents are unable to tinto the abdominal cavity. This occurs more often with alarge omphalocele, requiring the surgeon to do a stagedclosure. This involves covering the defect with a syn-thetic material that is sequentially squeezed like tooth-paste to reduce the defect into the abdominal cavity.After enough of the defect is in the abdominal cavity, asurgical repair is then performed (Glasser, 2007). Ifdamage to the exposed organs occurs, such as necrosis,then the necrotic sections are removed during the repair.If a signicant amount of small intestine is lost, then thecomplication of short bowel syndrome may occur. FIGURE24.15 Imperforate anus, in which the rectum ends in a blind pouch.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 749Postoperative care includes ensuring adequate pain relief, maintaining NPO status and gastric decompres-sion until normal bowel function is restored, and provid-ing colostomy care if applicable. HYPOSPADIAS Hypospadias is an abnormal positioning of the urinary meatus on the underside of the penis (Fig. 24.16A).Hypospadias is a relatively common birth defect that oc-curs in approximately 1 of every 300 male births in theUnited States (Gatti et al., 2007) The malformation is the result of incomplete fusion of the urethral folds, which usually occurs between 9 and12 weeks of gestation (Schnack et al., 2008). The causeis unknown, but it is thought to be of multifactorial in-heritance because it occasionally occurs in more than onemale in the same family. The degree of hypospadias depends on the location of the opening. It is often accompanied by a downwardbowing of the penis (chordee), which can lead to urina-tion and erection problems in adulthood. Hypospadias can be corrected surgically. Depending on the severity, the correction can be completed in one ormore procedures with good results. Surgical interventionshould be completed during the rst year of life to pre-vent any body image problems in the child. EPISPADIAS Epispadias is a rare congenital genitourinary defect occurring in 1 of 117,000 male births and 1 of 484,000 fe-750 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK male births (Gilbert, 2007). The condition is usually diagnosed at birth or shortly thereafter. In boys with epis-padias, the urethra generally opens on the top or siderather than the tip of the penis. In females, the urinarymeatus is located between the clitoris and the labia. Thisanomaly often occurs in conjunction with exstrophy of thebladder (Perovic & Djinovic, 2008). Surgical correction isnecessary, and affected male newborns should not be cir-cumcised (Lowdermilk & Perry, 2007; see Fig. 24.16B). BLADDER EXSTROPHY In bladder exstrophy, the bladder protrudes onto the abdominal wall because the abdominal wall failed toclose during embryonic development (Fig. 24.17). Wideseparation of the rectus muscles and the symphysis pubisaccompanies this defect. Virtually all affected male in-fants have associated epispadias. The upper urinary tractis usually normal. The incidence is approximately 1 in24,000 to 40,000 live births (March of Dimes, 2008b). A B FIGURE24.16 Genitourinary tract structural anomalies. (A) B). Epispadias. A B FIGURE24.17 Bladder exstrophy. Before surgical repair. (B) After surgery.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 750Goals of therapy include restoring urinary continence, preserving renal function, and reconstructing functionaland cosmetically acceptable genitalia. Initial bladder clo-sure is completed within 48 hours after birth. Epispadiasrepair occurs at this time if possible. Further surgicalreconstruction is performed in several stages at about 2 to3 years of age (see Fig. 24.17B). Nursing management of the newborn with bladder exstrophy includes the following activities: Identify the genitourinary defect at birth so that imme- diate treatment can be provided. Cover the exposed bladder with a sterile clear non- adherent dressing to prevent hypothermia and infection. Irrigate the bladder surface with sterile saline after each diaper change to prevent infection. Assist with insertion and monitoring of a suprapubic catheter to drain the bladder and prevent obstruction. Administer antibiotic therapy as ordered to prevent infection. Schedule diagnostic tests to assess for additional anomalies. Assess the newborn frequently for any signs of infection. Inspect skin surfaces frequently to ensure skin integrity. Maintain modied Bryant traction for immobilization after surgery. Administer antispasmodics, analgesics, and sedatives as ordered to prevent bladder spasm and provide comfort. Educate the parents about the care of the urinary catheter at home if applicable. Support the parents throughout. Promote bonding by encouraging the parents to visit and touch the newborn. Refer the parents to a support group to enhance their coping ability. Be a therapeutic listener to the family (Marvin, 2007). CONGENITAL CLUBFOOT Clubfoot, or talipes equinovarus, the forefoot, inversion of the heel andhindfoot, limitation of extension of the ankle and sub-talar joint, and internal rotation of the leg (Fig. 24.18;Patel & Herzenberg, 2007). Reducing or eliminating allof the components of the deformity is the goal to ensurethat the newborn has a functional, mobile, painless footthat does not require the use of special or modifiedshoes (Chesney, Barker, & Maffulli, 2007). The inci-dence of clubfoot is approximately 1 case per 1,000 livebirths in the United States. It is bilateral in about half ofthe cases and affects boys slightly more often than girls(Patel & Herzenberg, 2007).CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 751 Pathophysiology Clubfoot is a complex, multifactorial deformity with ge- netic and intrauterine factors. Heredity and race seemto factor into the incidence, but the means of transmis-sion and the etiology are unknown. Most newborns withclubfoot have no identifiable genetic, syndromal, or ex-trinsic cause. Clubfoot can be classied into extrinsic (supple) type, which is essentially a severe positional or soft tissue defor-mity, or intrinsic (rigid) type, where manual reduction isnot possible. Therapeutic Management The type of clubfoot deformity determines the treatmentcourse. Treatment for the extrinsic (supple) type con-sists of serial casting, followed by maintenance splinting. Treatment for the intrinsic (rigid) type includes initialcasting followed by surgery. It is generally agreed that theinitial treatment should be nonsurgical and started soonafter birth. A B FIGURE24.18 Clubfoot deformity. A) Initial (B). Application of cast.11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page 751Treatment for either type starts with serial casting, which is needed due to the rapid growth of the newborn.Casts initially are changed weekly and are applied untilthe deformity responds and is fully corrected. If serialcasting is not successful in correcting the deformity, sur-gical intervention is necessary between 4 and 9 months ofage (Gupta et al., 2008). Nursing Assessment On examination, the foot appears \"down and in.\" It issmaller, with a flexible, softer heel because of the hypoplas-tic calcaneus. The heel is internally rotated, making thesoles of the feet face each other when the deformity occursbilaterally. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on education, anticipatoryguidance, and pain management. Educate the parentsabout their newborn's condition and the treatment pro-tocol to reduce their anxiety, and provide reassurancethat the clubfoot is not painful and will not hinder thechild's development. Discuss challenges associated withsleep, play, and dressing. Inform them that slight modi-cations will be necessary to accommodate the plastercasts. Review positioning, bathing, and skin care alongwith pain management when new casts are applied. Stressthe need to provide a calm, quiet environment to pro-mote relaxation and sleep for their newborn. DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) involves abnormal growth or development of the hip that resultsin instability. This includes hips that are unstable, sub-luxated, or dislocated (luxated) or have a malformed ac-etabulum. The instability allows the femoral head tobecome easily displaced from the acetabulum. The in-cidence of hip instability is about 10 per 1,000 livebirths (Larson & Nurmi, 2008). The etiology of DDHis unclear. Therapeutic Management Treatment is started as soon as DDH is identied. If the newborn examination reveals DDH, the newborn is re-ferred to an orthopaedist. The goal of treatment is to re-locate the femoral head in the acetabulum to facilitatenormal growth and development. The Pavlik harness isthe most widely used device; it prevents adduction whileallowing flexion and abduction to accomplish the treat-ment goal (Fig. 24.19). The harness is worn continuously752 UNIT EIGHT THENEWBORN AT RISK until the hip is stable, which make take several months. If harnessing is not successful, surgery is necessary. Nursing Assessment Asses the history for risk factors, including racial back-ground (Native Americans), genetic transmission (runs infamilies), intrauterine positioning (breech), sex (female),oligohydramnios, birth order (rst-born), and postnatalinfant-carrying positions (swaddling, which forces the hipsto be adducted). FIGURE24.19 The Pavlik harness is used to treat developmentaldysplasia of the hip. DDH is frequently not identied during the newborn examination, so newborns require careful evaluation for hip dysplasia at subsequent visits throughout the rst year.Take NOTE! Complete a physical examination. Typically, the newborn with DDH is otherwise healthy, usually withoutany other deformities. Pay particular attention to assessinghip instability. Perform Ortolani and Barlow manuevers(see Chapter 18 for more information on these maneu-vers). Ortolani's maneuver elicits the sensation of the dis-located hip Barlow's maneuver detects theunstable hip dislocating from the acetabulum. Also ob-serve for other physical signs of DDH, including an asym-metric number of skin folds on the thigh or buttock, anapparent or true short leg, and limited Magee, 2007).11223-24_CH24.qxd 8/4/08 3:07 PM Page related to DDH starts with recog- nition of the disorder and early reporting to the healthcare provider. Early diagnosis is the crucial aspect; edu-cation also is key. Teach the parents how to care for theirnewborn while in the harness during treatment. Propert and adjustments for growth are essential for successfultreatment. Frequent clinical assessment on an outpatientbasis is needed to monitor progress. Through education,the nurse can be very effective in helping the parents tostay compliant with treatment. INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic disorders that disrupt normal metabolic function. Most are due to adefect in an enzyme or transport protein, resulting in a blocked metabolic pathway. Clinical symptoms aremanifested secondary to toxic accumulations of sub-stances before the block. When viewed individually, in-born errors of metabolism are rare, but collectively theyare responsible for significant levels of infant mortalityand morbidity. Table 24.6 summarizes four commoninborn errors. A successful outcome depends on early diagnosis and prompt intervention. Most inborn errors present in the newborn period with nonspecific and subtlemanifestations\u2014lethargy, hypotonia, respiratory dis-tress, poor feeding and weight gain, vomiting, andseizures (Kwon & Tsal, 2007). Identification of an in-born error of metabolism in a newborn depends largelyon the awareness of the nurse and clues from the mater-nal history, laboratory work, and clinical examination.CHAPTER 24 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE NEWBORN AT RISK: ACQUIRED AND CONGENITAL NEWBORN CONDITIONS 753 /H18546/H18546/H18546Key Concepts /H18546Asphyxia, the most common clinical insult in the peri- natal period, results in brain injury and may lead tomental retardation, cerebral palsy, or seizures. /H18546Transient tachypnea of the newborn occurs when the liquid in the lung is removed slowly or incompletely. /H18546Common risk factors for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) include young gestational age, perinatal asphyxiaregardless of gestational age, cesarean birth in the absence of labor (related to the lack of thoracic squeeze), male gender, and maternal diabetes. /H18546Meconium aspiration has three major pulmonary ef- fects: airway obstruction, surfactant dysfunction, andchemical pneumonitis. /H18546The management of persistent pulmonary hyperten- sion of the newborn requires meticulous attention todetail, with continuous monitoring of oxygenation,blood pressure, and perfusion. /H18546Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a developmental abnormality that affects the immature vasculature ofthe retina: abnormal growth of blood vessels (neovas-cularization) takes place within the retina and vitreous. /H18546Periventricular/intraventricular hemorrhage is bleed- ing that usually originates in the subependymal germi-nal matrix region of the brain with extension into theventricular system. /H18546Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastro- intestinal disease of unknown etiology in newborns that can result in necrosis of a segment of the bowel. /H18546Infants of diabetic mothers are at risk for malfor- mations most frequently involving the cardiovascu-lar, skeletal, central nervous, gastrointestinal, andgenitourinary systems; cardiac anomalies are the mostcommon. /H18546Factors that place the newborn at risk for birth trauma include cephalopelvic disproportion, maternal pelvicanomalies, oligohydramnios, prolonged or rapid labor, A B C FIGURE24.20 Characteristics of developmental dysplasia of the hip.

The number one cause of mortality in women is heart disease, accounting for more than one-half million deaths per year.Most women, however, believe that breast cancer is their number one concern. The mortality ratepales in comparison to that for cardiovascular deaths.Approximately 350 deaths occur secondary to child-birth complications. Statistics for injury resulting from violence would be much less than when comparedwith the numbers of women who die annually fromheart disease. 2.The correct response is C. Lack of adequate healthinsurance is a major barrier to receiving adequateprenatal care. Of the millions of Americans who haveno health insurance, the majority are women. Withouthealth insurance, many have limited options to pro-cure prenatal care. Statistics will demonstrate thebetter outcomes with prenatal care, and most women would want to have medical supervision for a betteroutcome. Most women seek care early in the preg-nancy, except for teenagers who hide or are unawareof their pregnancy. The majority of women receivequality prenatal care and the outcome is positive. Themistrust of traditional medical practices may play arole in some women from different cultures since theydiffer in their own cultural health practices. 3.The correct response is D. Pregnancy, contraception,and mental illness treatment are provided in manystates to adolescents without parental involvement.Those laws do not include the provision of care forcommunicable diseases such as tuberculosis, whichwould require parental consent and notication. 4.The correct response is B. The WIC program pro-vided and education tolow-income families; pregnant, postpartum, and lac-tating women; and infants and children up to age 5.Title V established a federal-state partnership andprovided aid to dependent families and children, maternal-child health services, and child welfare services. The Medicaid Program under Title XIXprovided state block grants to reduce nancial barri-ers to health care for the poor and special services topregnant women and young children. The Sheppard-Towner Act provided grants to states to establish maternal and child health division in state health care departments.5.The correct response is B, C, and D. Factors con- tributing to homelessness include economic factorssuch as the increase in poverty, lack of affordablehousing, decreases in availability of rent subsidies,unemployment, and cutbacks in public welfare programs. Personal crises such as divorce, domesticviolence, and substance abuse also are factors. Deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill has played a major role, especially without the development of community centers and homes to assist these individuals during times of crisis. Critical Thinking Exercise a. What changes might be helpful to address this situation? Many of the clients may have employment based on an hourly wage. If they don't work, they don't get paid, and thereforecan't attend the clinic during their normal work hours. Offerevening and Saturday hours to improve their attendance atclinic appointments. b. Outline what you might say at your next staff meeting to address the issue of clients making one clinic visit andthen never returning. Acceptance and a supportive tone are frequently set at the initial meeting, and one may need to examine how this iscommunicated to the client at their rst encounter with theclinic staff. Offer suggestions of how the staff can set a positive,welcoming tone so clients will return for additional care. c. What strategies might you use to improve attendance and notication? Have a staff person call each client to remind her of her appointment the next day and offer any needed assistanceto get her there. Assign a staff member to be an \"outreach\"person to make home visits to follow up on clients who habitually miss appointments. d. Describe what cultural and customer service techniques might be needed. Educate staff concerning cultural norms regarding the clientele served. Based on the culture served, devise culturally appropriatepolicies and procedures. Study Activities 1.Answers will vary depending on your location andtime period when researched. 2.Depending on the students' frames of reference,some will think it is a right and the governmentshould provide it for all citizens. Others will think it11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 771should be a privilege and should be paid for by the person and not the government. There is no right orwrong answer, but this topic can provide for a livelyclassroom discussion. 3.Women lack insurance to pay for services, no trans- portation available to get to services, language or cultural barriers, health care agency hours are in conflict with their work hours, and negative healthstaff attitudes. CHAPTER 2 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct responses are A, B, D, and F. Secondaryprevention includes early detection and treatment.Activities would include fecal occult blood testing,hearing screenings, cholesterol testing, and pregnancytesting. Smoking cessation and hygiene programs areexamples of activities at the primary prevention level. 2.The correct response is C. Advantages to outpatientsurgery centers include decreased risk for infection,decreased cost, decreased separation from family,and decreased disruption of family functioning. Themajor disadvantage associated with this site is the inability to accommodate overnight stays if necessarydue to complications. The woman would need to betransferred to a hospital for continued care. 3.The correct response is B. Always assess the client'slearning needs and preferred style of learning rst. 4.The correct response is C. Having knowledge of thevarious cultural variations in health care practiceshelps the nurse to apply them in his or her everydaypractice settings. This cultural sensitivity and applica-tion of it makes a culturally competent nurse. Know-ing one's own culture does not foster tolerance andacceptance of people from different ones. Only whenthe nurse gains knowledge about other cultures willhe or she become culturally competent. Being opento different cultural customs and beliefs is only thebeginning of becoming culturally competent; appli-cation of the knowledge is critical. Playing a role inestablishing policies without seeing them applied inthe health care setting is not going to break downbarriers to care. What is written policy may not be usedin the real world. Thus, everyone can refer to the policybut attitudes and actions have not changed. 5.The correct response is A. The current emphasis ison health promotion and illness prevention. Thus,the rise in community-based care has occurred dueto a movement away from an illness-oriented cureperspective to one that focuses on health promotion, with an emphasis on primary care and outpatienttreatment and management. Advances in technologyhave allowed for improved monitoring of clients incommunity settings and the ability to perform com-plicated procedures outside of the acute care setting.772 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS Critical Thinking Exercises 1.First, the nurse must determine who the authority gure and primary caretaker(s) of the woman are, aswell as the family's support system. Determine cul-tural, religious, or spiritual values the family wouldlike to have incorporated into the woman's care andthe language spoken at home and by the woman.Ascertain special dietary needs or the family's desire to incorporate particular health practices or providers.Additionally, the nurse would need to assess thewoman's and family's learning needs, keeping inmind the impact of culture on these needs. 2.Important areas of assessment include the woman's pregnancy and fetal status, physical condition andmedical needs, home environment, other members ofthe family such as other children, and assessment ofthe teaching and learning needs of the family. Thenurse needs to ensure that the woman can be caredfor at home. Other assessment areas include how thefamily is coping with the woman's need for care andprescribed bedrest. For example, do they appearoverwhelmed? Are there other children in the house that need assistance and care? How is the family func-tioning, and what support and resources are available?Assess whether the environment is safe and nurturingand the necessary resources are available, such asany equipment and medication that might be needed.Identify the primary care givers and include them inthe assessment and development of the plan of care. Study Activities 1.This shadowing activity will provide the student withexposure to a variety of roles and situations facingnurses in specic health care settings. 2.This visit would be very educational for nursingstudents to see what is happening in the real world when faced with cultural barriers in the health caresetting. Hopefully, the community health center staffwill be open to these students and will share theirstrategies. These strategies can be used by the studentslater in their practice. 3.Depending on the website selected, answers will vary,but most of them offer a variety of resources to learnabout different cultures and could be helpful tonurses seeking information. CHAPTER 3 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is B. FSH is secreted from theanterior pituitary gland to initiate follicles and the secretion of estrogen bythem within the ovarian cycle. A is incorrect: TSHstimulates the thyroid gland and plays a limited role11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 772in the menstrual cycle. C is incorrect: CRH is released from the hypothalamus, not the anterior pituitarygland. D is incorrect: GnRH is released from thehypothalamus to stimulate the release of FSH andLH from the anterior pituitary gland. 2.The correct response is C. Skene's glands are located close to the urethral opening and secrete mucus andlubricate during urination and sexual intercourse. A isincorrect: Cowper's glands are located on either sideof the male urethra, not the female urethra. B is incor-rect: Bartholin's glands are located on either side ofthe vaginal opening and secrete alkaline mucus thatenhances the viability of the male sperm. D is incorrect:seminal glands are pouchlike structures at the base ofthe male urinary bladder that secrete an alkaline fluidto enhance the viability of the male sperm. 3.The correct response is B. The proliferative phasestarts with the enlargement of the endometrial glands,which is stimulated by increasing amounts of estrogen.The blood vessels dilate and the endometrium in-creases in thickness dramatically. The proliferativephase of the menstrual cycle begins at the end of themenstrual phase and ends at ovulation. It is character-ized by endometrial thickening and ovarian follicular maturation. 4.The correct response is D. Progesterone is thedominant hormone after ovulation to prepare theendometrium for implantation. A is incorrect: estrogenlevels decline after ovulation, since it assists in thematuration of the ovarian follicles before ovulation.Estrogen levels are highest during the proliferativephase of the menstrual cycle. B is incorrect: prosta-glandin production increases during the follicularmaturation and is essential during ovulation but notafter ovulation. C is incorrect: prolactin is inhibitedby the high levels of estrogen and progesterone dur-ing pregnancy; when their levels decline at birth, anincrease in prolactin takes place to promote lactation. 5.The correct response is C. The function of the epi-didymis is to store and mature sperm until ejacula-tion occurs. A is incorrect: the testes manufacturesperm and send them to the epididymis for storageand continued maturation. B is incorrect: the mainfunction of the vas deferens is to rapidly squeeze thesperm from their storage site (epididymis) into theurethra. D is incorrect: the function of the seminalvesicles is to secrete an alkaline fluid rich in fructoseand prostaglandins to help provide an environmentfavorable to sperm motility and metabolism. Critical Thinking Exercise a. How should the nurse respond to this question? The nurse should respond by explaining to the student that conception is achieved only during the time of ovulation, whichoccurs at midcycle and not during menstruation. Further expla- nation might outline the phases of the menstrual cycle andANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 773 how each phase contributes to the preparation of the endome-trial lining if conception were to take place. If conception doesnot occur, sloughing of the prepared endometrial lining takesplace, and this is what is shed during menstruation. b. What factor regarding the menstrual cycle was not clarified? The student apparently did not understand the concept of ovulation and the potential uniting of sperm and ovum. Atovulation, bodily changes occur that assist the sperm to impregnate the ovum that was released from the ovary. It is only during this midcycle period that the sperm can findthe ovum and begin a pregnancy. c. What additional topics might this question lead to that might be discussed? Sexually transmitted infections and barrier protection; absti- nence until marriage and personal responsibility; responsibilitiesand outcomes of becoming a young parent; self-esteem andtaking pride in their bodies; future educational and career goals Study Activities 1.This answer will vary depending on which website thestudent selects and which topic of interest he or sheresearches. With luck, a variety of topics will be pre-sented and lend themselves to a lively class discussion. 2.The predominant hormones involved in the menstrualcycle are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH),which is responsible for reproductive hormone controland timing of the cycle; follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH), which stimulates to the ovary that will mature; luteiniz-ing hormone (LH), which induces the mature ovumto burst from the ovary and stimulate production ofcorpus luteum; which induces of prepares the endometrial lining for implanta-tion; and prostaglandins, which help to free the mature ovum inside the graaan follicle. 3.ovum or ova 4.The correct responses are F (testes) and G (semi-niferous tubules). Sperm is produced in the semi-niferous tubules of the testes. A is incorrect: the vas is a cordlike duct that transports spermfrom the epididymis and has no role in makingsperm cells. B is incorrect: the penis is the organ forcopulation and serves as the outlet for sperm, but it plays no role in the manufacture of sperm cells ortestosterone. C is incorrect: the scrotum serves asthe climate-control system for the testes to allow fornormal sperm development, but it plays no directrole in their manufacture. D is incorrect: the ejacula-tory ducts secrete fluids to help nourish the sperm,but do not play a part in their development. E is incor-rect: the prostate gland produces fluid that nourishes11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 773the sperm but does not participate in the production of sperm cells. H is incorrect: the bulbourethral glands(Cowper's glands) secrete a mucus-like fluid thatprovides lubrication during the sex act. CHAPTER 4 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is B: the denition of infertility is the inability of a couple to conceive after 12 monthsof unprotected sexual intercourse. A is incorrect: 6 months is not long enough to diagnose infertility in a couple not using birth control. C is incorrect: 18 months is 6 months beyond the time needed to diagnose infertility based on the denition. D is incorrect: 24 months is double the time needed to diagnose infertility. 2.The correct response is B: if EC is taken within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse, preg-nancy will be prevented by inhibiting implantation.The next morning would still afford time to take ECand not become pregnant. A is incorrect: it wouldbe too late to use a spermicidal agent to preventpregnancy, since the sperm have already traveled upinto the female reproductive tract. C is incorrect:douching with vinegar and hot water 24 hours afterunprotected sexual intercourse will not change thecourse of events; by then it is too late to prevent apregnancy, and this combination would not be ef-fective anyway. D is incorrect: a laxative will stimu-late the gastrointestinal tract to produce defecationbut will not disturb the reproductive tract, wherefertilization takes place. 3.The correct response is A: Seasonale is the onlyFDA-approved oral contraceptive that is packaged toprovide 84 days of continuous protection. Althoughany oral contraceptive can be taken continuously, theFDA has not approved this, and it would be consid-ered an \"off-label\" use. B is incorrect: this producthas not gained FDA approval for continuous use; it isto be left in 3 weeks and then removed for 1 week tocreate monthly cycles. C is incorrect response: theFDA has not given approval to use this transdermalpatch on a continuous basis; it is placed on the skinfor 3 weeks and removed for 1 week. D is incorrect:this implantable device is protective for 5 years, butit is not a combination contraceptive; it releasessynthetic progesterone only, not estrogen. 4.The correct response is D: weight-bearing exercise is an excellent preventive measure to preserve boneintegrity, especially the vertebral column and hips.Walking strengthens the skeletal system and preventsbreakdown that leads to osteoporosis. A is incorrect:iron does not prevent bone breakdown; while ironsupplementation will build up blood and preventanemia, it has a limited effect on bones. B is incorrect:774 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS being in the horizontal position while sleeping is not helpful to build bone. Weight-bearing on long boneshelps to maintain their density, which prevents lossof bone matrix. C is incorrect: protein gained fromeating lean meats helps the body to build tissue and muscles but has a limited effect on maintaining boneintegrity or preventing loss of bone density. 5.The correct response is B because smoking cigarettescauses vasoconstriction of the blood vessels, increas-ing peripheral vascular resistance and thus elevatingblood pressure. These vascular changes increase thechances of CVD by placing additional pressure on theheart to pump blood with increasing vessel resistance.A is incorrect since fiber would be a positive dietaddition and assist with elimination patterns and prevent straining, which stresses the heart. C is an incorrect response because vitamins do not causenarrowing of the vessel lumen, which places an additional burden on the heart. D is an incorrect response since alcohol produces vasodilation and reduces blood pressure. Alcohol in moderation is said to be good for the heart. 6.The correct response is C since vasomotor instability,which causes hot flashes, is directly related to decliningestrogen levels. Increasing the estrogen levels by hor-mone replacement therapy reduces vasomotor insta-bility and thus hot flashes. A is an incorrect responsesince weight gain or loss is associated with calorie intake and metabolic output in the form of energyexpended through exercise. Although many womenreport a weight gain associated with HRT, when ques-tioned closely they admit to a reduction in activitylevel. B is incorrect since estrogen has the opposite effect on bone density-it increases and/or maintains it.HRT is prescribed for post-menopausal women toprevent osteoporosis, or loss of bone density. D is incorrect since the incidence of heart disease (myocar- dial infarction and strokes) was found to increase in women taking HRT in the WHI research study, if hormones were taken in high doses over a long period.Based on that landmark study, women on HRTshould take the lowest dose possible to relieve symp-toms and should not take HRT for more than 5 years. 7.The correct response is A: exercise is heart-healthy,weight-healthy, and emotionally healthy. The motto\"Keep moving\" is the basis for a healthy lifestyle, sinceit will help maintain an ideal weight, improve circula-tion, and improve moods. B is incorrect: socializationdoes not necessarily involve physical activity and wouldnot be proactive in preserving health. C is incorrect:quiet time alone, although needed to reduce stress,reduces movement and may result in depression andweight gain. D is incorrect: water, although neededto hydrate the body, will not maintain circulation,prevent weight gain, or improve one's emotionalmindset. Exercise will accomplish all three.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 7748.The correct response is D. This vaginal barrier contraceptive device is a dome-shaped rubber cupwith a flexible rim that needs to be inserted into thewoman's vagina before sexual intercourse. The domeof the diaphragm covers the cervix and the spermicidalcream or jelly applied to the rim prevents sperm fromentering the cervix. Women who use this method ofcontraception must be able to insert the device intheir vaginas before each sex act for it to be effective.If the woman is uncomfortable \"touching\" herself,this is not going to be a successful method and anothermethod should be utilized. Critical Thinking Exercise a. Is an IUS the most appropriate method for her? Why orwhy not? In this case, based on her history of STIs, PID, and multiple partners, she is not a candidate for an IUS. This method wouldincrease her risk of further ascending infections, which couldhinder her future fertility. Unless her lifestyle choices changedramatically, she is placing herself at risk. She should beencouraged to use barrier methods for contraception. b. What myths/misperceptions will you address in your counseling session? This client states she isn't interested in using birth control pills because they cause cancer. That is not true, and an explanationof risk factors for cancer needs to be given, along with a discussion of the lower doses of estrogen in the birth controlpills prescribed today. Positive noncontraceptive impactssuch as a reduction in ovarian and colorectal cancers shouldalso be addressed. c. Outline the safer sex discussion you plan to have with her. Having a monogamous relationship reduces the incidence of STIs. Using barrier methods (condom, cap, diaphragm) protects against both pregnancy and STIs. Oral sex using a dental dam reduces the risk of STIs. Dry kissing with no sores or broken skin reduces the risk of STIs. Inform the client of the relationship between PID and infertility. Encourage prompt treatment of any vaginal discharge. Study Activities 1.Teaching plan for an adolescent with PMS:1. Dene the condition in simple terms to increase the teen's understanding of it. 2. Cite statistics about the incidence of it to let her know it is a common entity. 3. Assign her the task of tracking her symptoms that most profoundly bother her. 4. Carefully study the patterns/trends of the symptoms to explain what is occurring.ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 775 5. Discuss an overall comprehensive approach to managing her symptoms:a. Dietary changes i. Resist carbohydrate cravings premenstrually ii. Reduce caffeine intake, which tends to increase nervous tension iii. Vitamins B6, A and E have shown some promise in studies b. Aerobic exercise throughout month helps in reducing pain c. Medical therapy, if lifestyle changes don't work to relive symptoms i. Antidepressants ii. Tranquilizers iii. Oral contraceptives 2.Typically the family planning nurse will ask the womanabout any sociocultural, spiritual, and religious beliefsthat will influence the decision. Lifestyle and econom-ics also play a big role in the choice of a family planningmethod. Ideally this should be a decision made by bothpartners, but rarely is the partner involved. Importantteaching involves the risks, benefits, side effects, andefficacy of each method, along with instructions on how to use it correctly. Information regardingfollow-up care should be stressed. 3.Numerous websites are available, many of themsponsored by infertility health care agencies. 4.Prices will be higher in metropolitan versus ruralareas of the county. Students will discover that therisk is higher for a woman undergoing a tubal ligationthan a man undergoing a vasectomy. The costs willvary, but male sterilization is generally both less riskyand less expensive. 5.The students will nd numerous brands of male con-doms and only one brand of female condom. Malecondoms prices can range from 35 cents each to over$4, depending on the manufacturer. Most femalecondoms are priced around $2.50 to $3.50 each. 6.A, B, D, E, and G are correct responses: researchstudies have validated a reduced incidence of thesecancers and conditions. C and F are incorrect: researchhas not shown a reduction, and some studies haveactually found an increase in the incidence of breastcancer and deep vein thrombosis. CHAPTER 5 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is C: it creates a mechanical barrier so that bacteria and viruses cannot gain accessto the internal reproductive tract and proliferate. A isincorrect: there is no barrier or protection offered bytaking an oral pill. Oral contraceptives offer protectionagainst pregnancy by preventing ovulation, but noneagainst STIs. B is incorrect: an infected partner can11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 775still transmit the infection through preejaculate fluids, which may contain an active STI. D is incorrect: anIUD offers no barrier to prevent entrance of bacteriaor viruses into the internal reproductive tract. Becauseit is an internal device, the string emerging from theexternal uterine os can actually enhance STI inltra-tion into the uterus in susceptible women. 2.The correct response is A: the HIV virus is notspread through casual contact between individuals.HIV is spread through unprotected sexual intercourse,breastfeeding, blood contact, or shared needles or sextoys. B is incorrect: HIV can be spread by sharing injection equipment because the user can come into contact with HIV-positive blood. C is incorrect: sex-ual intercourse (unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral)poses the highest risk of HIV transmission. D is incor-rect: the newborn can receive the HIV virus through infected breast milk. HIV-positive women are advisednot to breastfeed to protect their offspring from gettinga HIV infection. 3.The correct response is B: the human papillomavirus(HPV) causes warts in the genital region. HPV is aslow-growing DNA virus belonging to the papillomagroup. Types 6 and 11 usually cause visible genitalwarts. Other HPV types in the genital region (16, 18,31, 33, and 35) are associated with vaginal, anal,and cervical dysplasia. A is incorrect: a pus-filleddischarge is not typical of an HPV infection, but rathera chlamydial or gonococcal STI. C is incorrect: asingle painless ulcer would be indicative of primarysyphilis rather than an HPV infection. D is incorrect:multiple vesicles would indicate a herpes outbreak,not an HPV infection. The woman would also expe-rience tingling, itching, and pain in the affected area. 4.The correct response is D: a ruptured tubal pregnancysecondary to an ectopic pregnancy can cause life-threatening hypovolemic shock. Without immediatesurgical intervention, death can result. A is incorrect:involuntary infertility may be emotionally traumatic,but it is not life-threatening. B is incorrect: chronicpelvic pain secondary to adhesions is unpleasant buttypically is not life-threatening. C is incorrect: depres-sion may be caused by the chronic pain or involuntaryinfertility but is not life-threatening. 5.The correct response is C: the classic chancre inprimary can be described as a painless, indurated ulcer-like lesion at the site of exposure. A is incorrect: a highly variable rash is characteristicof secondary syphilis, not primary. B is incorrect: thisis more descriptive of a trichomoniasis vaginal infectionrather than primary syphilis, which manifests with achancre on the external genitalia. D is incorrect: a localized gumma formation on the mucous mem-branes, such as the lips or nose, is characteristic oflate syphilis, along with neurosyphilis and cardio-vascular syphilis.776 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS Critical Thinking Exercise a. What STI would the nurse suspect? Based on the description of the genital lesions, the nurse would suspect genital herpes. Typically the herpetic lesions beginas erythematous papules that then develop into vesicles. Thevesicles rupture and leave ulcerated lesions and then crustover. This is essentially what Sally described in her history. b. The nurse should give immediate consideration to which of Sally's complaints? As with any STI, treatment should aim at promoting comfort, promoting healing, preventing secondary infection, and decreas-ing transmission of the disease. A sample from a genital lesionshould be obtained for a denitive diagnosis. A urine sampleshould be checked for bacteria to rule out a bladder infection.Giving information about the specific STI is important topromote understanding. Information concerning her antiviralmedication therapy is paramount to reduce the viral shedding.Sitz baths and mild analgesics may be needed for pain relief. c. What should be the goals of the nurse in teaching Sally about STIs? Although acyclovir or another antiviral medication can reduce the symptoms of herpes, the nurse needs to point out that itis not a cure for herpes. Antiviral drugs act to suppress viralreplication but do not rid the body of them. This STI is a life-time one, and she may experience numerous episodes. Thenurse should teach Sally that this condition is manageable,but she will need to be able to identify stress factors thatmay trigger a recurrence and reduce them. Common triggersmay include hormonal changes, such as ovulation during themenstrual cycle; prolonged exposure to sunlight; emotionaldistress; lack of sleep; and overwork. The nal goal is to makesure Sally understands how to prevent transmission of herpesand what changes in her behaviors need to take place imme-diately to protect her health. Study Activities 1.Depending on which website the students select andwhich STI they choose to research, discussions willvary. We hope that each student will bring additionalinformation to the discussion and will share interesting\"nds\" with his or her peers. 2.Statistics will vary depending on the student's location.This research will help students learn what is happen-ing in their area and what preventive measures arebeing used to reduce the incidence of STIs. 3.The counseling role of the STI nurse should be oneof patience and sensitivity. The nurse should be non-judgmental and should see the client as someone who needs both treatment and education. The nurseshould counsel the patient about high-risk behaviorsand prevention of disease transmission. 4.chlamydia and gonorrhea11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 7765.The correct responses are B, C, and D: all three therapies assist in reducing the viral load in the warty lesion. Treatment may reduce but does not necessarilyeradicate infection. A is incorrect: penicillin is a bac-teriostatic agent and is not effective against viruses. E is incorrect: antiretroviral therapy is used for HIVinfections. F is incorrect: acyclovir is typically used totreat herpes infections. CHAPTER 6 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is C: visible changes to the skin of the breast take place (dimpling, contour changes,nipple discharge) and can be seen if inspected infront of a mirror. A is incorrect: breast cancer rstspreads to the axillary lymph nodes, not the cervicalnodes. Palpation of the axillary lymph nodes is war-ranted, not the cervical ones. B is incorrect: sponta-neous nipple discharge is more indicative of breast cancer than discharge produced by squeezing thenipple. D is incorrect: a mammogram is not part ofa breast self-examination, which the woman does inthe privacy of her home. 2.The correct response is A: the incidence of breastcancer increases with aging, especially over age 50.Only 1% of breast cancers occur in men. B is incor-rect: bearing children interrupts the menstrual cycleand decreases a woman's risk of breast cancer. C isincorrect: only 7% of women have a genetic mutationresulting in breast cancer, whereas in the remaining93% it is a sporadic occurrence. D is incorrect: coloncancer is not a risk factor for breast cancer. 3.The correct response is B: this describes the proce-dure for performing a sentinel node biopsy. A is incorrect: there is no dye used and a biopsy is takenof the breast mass, not the node. C is incorrect: thisis an actual surgical removal of the axillary nodes andnot just a biopsy, and no dye is used in this procedure.D is incorrect: an advanced breast biopsy does not usedye and involves taking a tissue sample of the breastmass, not the nodes in the axillary area. 4.The correct response is D: when the bone marrow is suppressed secondary to chemotherapy, the womanexperiences bleeding tendencies (low platelets), limited immunity (low white blood cells), and anemia(low red blood cells). This myelosuppression canbecome life-threatening. A is incorrect: a decrease in the number of platelets in the circulating bloodmay cause bleeding tendencies if the body is trau-matized, but it is not as life-threatening as having allbone marrow cells depressed. B is incorrect: havingblood clots in deep veins is typically not a frequentresponse to chemotherapy, whereas myelosuppres-sion is very common. C is incorrect: losing one'sANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 777 hair, while emotionally and aesthetically traumatizing,it is not a life-threatening event, and the hair willgrow back after therapy ends. 5.The correct response is B: the discomfort is usuallymild and analgesics will relieve it in most cases. A isincorrect: women are advised to reduce caffeine toreduce the stimulation of breast tissue, not increase it. C is incorrect: women are advised to increase theirintake of leafy vegetables, not reduce them, since this would be a part of a balanced healthy diet. D isincorrect: women are advised to wear a rm supportivebra to reduce the strain on the breast tissue, not a brathat offers no support. 6.The correct response is D: this volunteer organizationoffers support and practical advice to women withbreast cancer; all the volunteers have had breastcancer themselves. A is incorrect: NOW does notfocus on breast cancer per se, but all women's issues,especially ones of equality. B is incorrect: the FDA isconcerned with the regulation, security, and safetyof all foods and drugs in the United States, not breastcancer issues. C is incorrect: the March of Dimes focuses on prevention of preterm births and reductionof birth defects, not breast cancer. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. What specic questions would you ask this client to get aclearer picture? The nurse needs to assess this client's risk factors for breast cancer by asking about: Her family history of breast or ovarian cancer Her own health history Her gynecologic history (menarche, parity, family planning) Her history of breast problems (previous benign disorders) Her lifestyle habits, which may be associated with cancer (e.g., smoking, high intake of fat, alcohol intake) b. What education is needed for this client regarding breast health? The nurse needs to reassure the client that most breast lesions are benign, but this problem will need to be explored. The factshe experiences cyclic pain suggests this problem may be bro-cystic breast changes and not cancer, but she should undergo afurther workup. Stress the importance of performing monthlybreast self-examinations, receiving yearly mammograms, andscheduling annual clinical breast examinations with her healthcare provider to assist in taking control of her health. c. What community referrals are needed to meet this client's future needs? During October of each year, many health care agencies honor National Breast Cancer month by offering free or reduced-costmammograms. The nurse needs to make the client aware of thisand urge her to receive a mammogram to maintain her health.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 7772. a. What benign condition might the nurse practitioner suspect based on her description? Based on her history and symptom description, the NP probably would suspect the benign breast condition duct ectasia. b. What specic information should the nurse practitioner give Mrs. Davis about duct ectasia? Information given should include: Duct ectasia is a disease of ducts in the subareolar zone that occurs in aging breasts.Manifestations include a palpable dilated duct; a thick, green,sticky nipple discharge; pain; itching; and inflammation. Thereis no association with cancer. c. The typical treatment of this benign breast condition would include what? Treatment for duct ectasia consists of reassurance and sup- port. Although there is no cure for duct ectasia, antibiotics are prescribed for acute inflammatory episodes. The woman should be taught how to cleanse the breast to minimize therisk of infection. Good handwashing and personal hygienemeasures are stressed. Instructing her to wear a supportive yet nonconning bra will help reduce her discomfort. Study Activities 1.A woman's breasts have a variety of meanings andsymbolize various things to women. To some women,her breasts symbolize her female self and her abilityto suckle her newborn, and separate her biologicallyfrom a man. To society, a woman's breasts can beviewed as a sex symbol and denote sexiness. Differentcultures view a woman's breasts differently, dictatingwhether or not she is welcome to expose them forbreastfeeding. 2.Feelings might include fear of cancer, anxiety, help-lessness, embarrassment, denial, or depression. Anurse can help her cope with these feelings by givingher the facts and reassuring her that most breastdisorders are benign. Guide the woman through the diagnostic tests needed to validate her condition. 3.Lifestyle modications that can reduce the discomfortof brocystic breast changes might include taking oralcontraceptives; eating a low-fat diet rich in fruits andvegetables; avoiding caffeine intake; reducing salt intake; wearing a well-tting, bra most time; and taking over-the-counter analgesics toreduce mild discomfort. 4.mastitis CHAPTER 7 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is C: pressure against adjacent structures and stretching of the uterine muscle withincreasing growth of the fibroid creates pain. A is778 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS incorrect: migraines are not caused by growing broids, but rather a change within the vasculature in thecranium. B is incorrect: bladder pressure to causeurinary urgency would be secondary to pelvic struc-ture relaxation, not uterine broids. D is incorrect:constipation would be more common in a woman experiencing pelvic organ prolapse than in one withbroids, since broids usually involve the uterus, notthe rectum. 2.The correct response is A: both pessaries and Kegelexercises help hold up and strengthen the pelvic floorto restore the pelvic organs to their correct anatomicposition. B is incorrect: an external xation devicewould not be a tolerable long-term solution; it wouldalso be invasive and would place the woman at riskfor infection. C is incorrect: weight gain is not usuallya healthy intervention for women as they age. Addi-tional weight would increase the pressure on pelvicorgans and exacerbate the problem. Yoga is relaxingand could reduce the woman's stress level, but it wouldnot be therapeutic for pelvic organ prolapse. D isincorrect: wearing firm support garments might increase intra-abdominal pressure and cause furtherdownward descent of the pelvic organs. 3.The correct response is A: preventing constipationand straining with defecation would lessen the strainon pelvic organs. B is incorrect: sitting for long peri-ods will not affect pelvic organ movement. Gravitywill create a downward pull on all organs regardlessof the position, sitting or standing. C is incorrect:exercise will help to tone muscles within the bodyand strengthen the pelvic floor. D is incorrect: fre-quent childbirth contributes to pelvic organ pro-lapse rather than preventing it. Spacing childrenonly a year apart would negatively influence thepelvic-floor musculature and would be a contributingfactor for prolapse. 4.The correct response is C: insulin resistance is char-acterized by failure of insulin to enter cells appropri-ately, resulting in hyperinsulinemia, a characteristicof PCOS. Factors that contribute to this includeobesity, physical inactivity, and poor dietary habits. This person is at risk for developing type 2 diabetessecondary to insulin resistance. A is incorrect: osteo- porosis develops in aging women because of declin- ing estrogen and calcium levels, not due to PCOS.B is incorrect: lupus is an autoimmune conditionand is not related to PCOS. D is incorrect: migraineheadaches are not associated with PCOS but ratherchanges in cranium vessels. 5.The correct response is GnRH agonists block theproduction of estrogen, which produces menopausalsymptoms. A is incorrect: osteoporosis would be along-term result of estrogen deprivation and calcium,and typically women do not stay on GnRH agonistsfor long-term therapy. B is incorrect: the blocking of11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 778estrogen would not contribute to the development of arthritis. C is incorrect: inhibiting estrogen is not acause of depression; a change in serotonin levels inthe brain is a cause of depression. Critical Thinking Exercise a. What condition might Faith have based on her symptoms? The symptoms are suggestive of uterine broids. She presents with a typical prole. b. What treatment options are available to address this condition? If Faith desires to preserve her childbearing ability, she can be treated medically with oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, mifepristone, or a myomectomy. If sheis finished with childbearing, a vaginal hysterectomy wouldbe advised. c. What educational interventions should the nurse discuss with Faith? The nurse needs to make sure that Faith understands what the disorder is and how it can be treated and should provideinformation to assist her in making a decision about treatment.In addition to the treatment modalities for broids, her irondeciency anemia needs attention with iron preparations anddietary changes to increase her iron and vitamin C intake. Study Activities 1.Offer an explanation of how this inconspicuous exercise can help build muscle volume. Show a picture of where this pelvic floor muscle is located.Pelvic floor relaxation comes with the aging processin women secondary to childbirth, weight gain, and the force of gravity. The easiest way to instruct a woman how to do Kegel exercises is to have her practice using the pubococcygeus muscle by starting and stopping the flow of urine. Have her tighten thepubococcygeus muscle for a count of three, thenrelax it. This maneuver should be done at least 10 times each day. 2.The symptoms that accompany pelvic organ prolapsemight include stress incontinence, urinary frequencyand urgency, a feeling of bladder fullness after voiding,constipation, rectal fullness, painful intercourse, andpelvic pressure. All of the symptoms combined wouldtend to keep a woman isolated from society and herpartner because of the embarrassment of odor, dis-comfort, and accidents. A woman would not feel incontrol of her body functions and would thus feelvulnerable in most social or intimate circumstances.Joining a support group of women experiencing simi-lar problems would allow her to express her feelingsand nd support through others. Suggestions aboutwhat works and what doesn't work and how to copewith this situation would be very helpful.ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 779 3.Symptoms common in women with uterine broids include low back pain, menorrhagia, anemia, dys-pareunia, dysmenorrhea, bloating, and feelings ofheaviness in the pelvic region. A woman might delayseeking treatment because she fears she has cancerand thus might be in denial as a protective mecha-nism. Many women associate irregular bleeding andpain with the diagnosis of cancer. 4.cystocele 5.rectocele CHAPTER 8 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct answer is B: typically there are no glaringfeatures of ovarian cancer. Many of the symptoms are nonspecic and can easily be explained away andrationalized as changes related to the aging process.A is incorrect: ovarian cancer is aggressive and spreadsearly. C is incorrect: women do not have to die to bediagnosed with ovarian cancer. D is incorrect: mostwomen with acute pain bring it to the attention oftheir health care provider, but acute pain is a latesymptom of cancer. 2.The correct response is D: any postmenopausalbleeding is suspicious for endometrial cancer. Thisevent warrants immediate evaluation, which wouldinclude an endometrial biopsy. A is incorrect: post-menopausal women do not have menstrual periodsunless they are taking hormone replacement therapy.B is incorrect: any postmenopausal bleeding is abnor-mal and needs evaluation to determine its cause. The exception would be for a woman taking hormonereplacement therapy and still experiencing monthlycycles. C is incorrect: warm-water douches wouldnot be advised for a woman experiencing post-menopausal bleeding, since it would not be thera-peutic or warranted. Determining the etiology of the spotting or bleeding is imperative. 3.The correct response is A: women need clear informa-tion to make informed choices about treatment andaftercare. This information will help reduce her anxietyand chose the best course of action for her. B is incor-rect: hand-holding is important if used appropriately, but having clear information about what to expectand treatment options will go a longer way to meether psychosocial needs. C is incorrect: cheerfulness isnot necessarily therapeutic in the face of a grave prog-nosis. D is incorrect: instilling hope is important, butgiving clear information would be more of a priority. 4.The correct response is C: Pap smears are done specif- ically to detect abnormal cells of the cervix that mightbe cancerous. A is incorrect: a fecal occult blood testwould be useful in detecting blood in the gastrointesti-nal tract and might be diagnostic of colorectal cancer,not cervical cancer. B is 3:08 PM Page 779not specic for cervical cancer, but levels may rise in pancreatic, liver, colon, breast, and lung cancers. D isincorrect: a sigmoidoscopy is used to visualize the sig-moid colon to identify cancer, polyps, or blockages. Itis not diagnostic of cervical cancer. 5.The correct response is B: typically ovarian cancer is not diagnosed until it is in advanced stages, when theprognosis and survival rates are poor. A is incorrect:vulvar cancer is usually recognized earlier and whentreated in its early stages is curable. C is incorrect:endometrial cancer can usually be detected secondaryto postmenopausal bleeding and can be treated ifdetected early by surgery to remove the uterus orsource of cancer. D is incorrect: cervical cancer, ifdetected early and treated, can be eliminated. Withearly treatment, it does not carry a high mortality rate. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. Based on her history, which risk factors for cervical cancer are present? This client is at high risk for several conditions, including sexu- ally transmitted infections as well as cervical cancer, because ofthe following risk factors: smoking, early onset of sexual activity,multiple partners, and no previous Pap smears. b. What recommendations would you make for her and why? Schedule an appointment for a Pap smear and instruct her to keep it. It may save her life. The ACS strongly recommendscervical cancer screening for all women who are sexually ac-tive within 3 years of the start of sexual activity or at the ageof 21. This client has not undergone any assessment and en-gages in high-risk behavior. c. What are this client's educational needs concerning health maintenance? Cigarette smoking and multiple sexual partners from an early age strongly correlate with cervical dysplasia and cancer andincrease risk. This client needs to undergo a Pap smear annu-ally, stop smoking, use barrier methods for protection, and re-duce the number of sexual partners. The nurse should refer herto community social services to obtain employment and thushealth insurance to continue health maintenance activities.The nurse should stress the importance of lifestyle behavioralchanges that she needs to make to preserve her health. 2. a. Is this client's profile typical for a woman with this diagnosis? Yes, Jennifer represents the typical presentation of a woman with epithelial ovarian cancer. She was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer that had spread to other abdominal organs and the lymph nodes by the time she was diagnosed.She essentially experienced no symptoms of concern prior toher diagnosis. Her 5-year survival rate is poor because of heradvanced cancer state.780 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS b. What in her history might have increased her risk for ovarian cancer? Jennifer already had been diagnosed with breast cancer, which places her at an increased risk for ovarian can cer. In addition, she had no prior pregnancies to interrupt her men-strual cycles, which would be helpful in lowering her risk ofdeveloping ovarian cancer. Finally, Jennifer has a history ofperineal talc exposure, which increases her risk because of itssimilarity to asbestos. c. What can the nurse do to increase awareness of this cancer for all women? Community education can be very effective in increasing aware- ness of this condition. Education should focus on pertinent information about risk-reduction measures, screening options for women at high risk, and the importance of annual exami-nations. In addition, nurses should keep current on researchconcerning ovarian cancer and should be able to disseminatethis information at health fairs and women's support groups. Study Activities 1.Depending on the type of reproductive cancer thestudent selects, the responses will vary. Typicallythe symptoms described are vague, and the womanmay have delayed seeking help from her health careprovider. Her preoperative emotions are usually fear,denial, and anxiety regarding the unknown. Her post-operative feelings can include relief, worry, depres-sion, and anxiety again. Her future may seem brightif the cancer was detected early, but it may be bleakif it is advanced. 2.Depending on where the student lives and whatcommunity resources are available, the responses willvary. The purpose of this eld trip is to acquaint thestudents with their community resources and to visu-alize the equipment used in cancer treatment. Cancertreatment centers are very specialized, and most offernumerous modalities of care. It is important thatstudents know what is available in their communities and be informed referral agents. 3.Most websites address the lay public and offer educa-tion about each type of cancer. Most urge clients toseek specic information concerning their symptomsor situation from their health care practitioner. 4.ovarian 5.breast and ovarian CHAPTER 9 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is D: giving women the ability to gain control over their lives allows them to makethe changes needed to protect themselves and theirchildren. As long as they feel victimized, they willtake little action to make change. A is incorrect:being the victim of abuse is not a mental illness, but11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 780involves being in circumstances where her courage and self-esteem may be hindered. B is incorrect:leaving the abuser is a process, not an abrupt action, and a great deal of preparation is needed beforemaking this move. C is incorrect: nurses don't have the resources to provide nancial support to abusedwomen, but they can make referrals to communityagencies that could help with job training. 2.The correct response is B: tension builds within theabuser, and he demonstrates increased anger andviolent behavior without any provocation from thewoman. This tension-building phase starts the cycleof violence. A is incorrect: typically the woman doesn'tprovoke the abuser's violent behavior, but he blamesher for his lack of anger control. C is incorrect: inthe honeymoon phase, the final phase in the cycleof violence, the abuser says he is sorry, he loves her, and it will never happen again. D is incorrect: in theexplosion stage of the cycle of violence, the abuserphysically harms the woman. This stage follows thetension-building phase. 3.The correct response is C: women with low self-esteemand limited communication skills seem more likelyto become victims of abuse than those with goodcommunication skills and assertiveness. Womenpossessing these skills would be able to make changesin their life and would not fall victim to abuse. A isincorrect: cooking skills have a limited impact on abu-sive relationships. The woman's ability to communi-cate and feel strong within herself will provide herwith better preventive tools than her cooking skills. B is incorrect: being a good decorator will not preventabuse. Good self-esteem and work skills will go furtherto help her recover from an abusive relationship thanbeing a good homemaker. D is incorrect: improvingher appearance would not prevent her from becominga victim again if her self-esteem remains low. Improv-ing her appearance through weight loss and exercisewould, however, improve her overall health status andability to survive her abusive past. 4.The correct response is A: this statement promotesa sense of self-worth, which may have been destroyedby her abuser in the relationship. This statement indicates to the woman that she has a lot to offerand that she shouldn't put up with this abusive behavior. The victim may not have heard this message before; her abuser may have convinced her that she did deserve the violence. B is incorrect:many children living in violent homes are abusedthemselves and extremely stressed. No childrenshould live under such stressful circumstances; atwo-parent household is not healthy if one is anabuser. C is incorrect: in most cases the womandoesn't trigger the abuse; rather, the abuser haslimited control over his anger and does not need to be provoked before lashing out. There is not nec-essarily a cause-and-effect relationship between theANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 781 woman's behavior and the violence. D is incorrect:over time the abuse typically escalates rather thanlessens; thus, giving the partner more time will notbring him to his senses. Critical Thinking Exercise a. Outline your conversation when you broach the subject of abuse with Mrs. Boggs. Since you suspect abuse, asking a direct question about whether she feels safe in her own home might open up the conversationand allow Mrs. Boggs to talk about the situation. If she deniesthat there is a problem, reassure her that you care, that you areafraid for her safety, and that she deserves better. Opening thedoor for discussion is the rst step toward change. b. What is your role as a nurse in caring for this family in which you suspect abuse? Allow Mrs. Boggs to know that you are there for her when she is ready to talk about her situation and that she deserves bet-ter than this. If she is unwilling to do so at this time, continueto ask screening questions about abuse on each subsequentvisit. Providing her with the National Domestic Violence Hot- line number might be helpful. c. What ethical/legal considerations are important in planning care for this family? If you notice that Mrs. Boggs has suffered acute abuse, by law you must report it. You also need to document any injuries tostrengthen this case if it were to go to trial. Accurate docu-mentation can also be used as justication for a variety ofother actions, such as restraining orders, compensation, andinsurance and welfare payments. You have an ethical andlegal responsibility to report the abuse and assist the woman;do not ignore it and pass it off as \"a private family dispute.\" Study Activities 1.This website includes postings from women in abu-sive relationships. It may help the students grasp theextent of violence in our society and may prompt themto lobby legislators to pass stricter laws to protect thevictims of abuse. 2.This exercise may help the students put the issue of domestic violence into perspective and determinewhether they live in a safe state. They may also discover what interventions might help to reducedomestic violence. 3.Campus security personnel often present safety pro-grams for women about how to protect themselvesagainst date rape and sexual assault. This informationwill serve any woman well whether she lives on thecampus or not. 4.This activity should provide an eye-opening experi- ence about the frequency of calls related to domesticviolence and how much time police ofcers spenddealing with it.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 7815.Three community resources that a victim of violence might need include: i. Women's shelters to house women and children\u2014 United Way and local funding ii. Law enforcement agencies for restraining orders\u2014 county and state funding iii. Counseling services to empower the individual\u2014 private and local funding CHAPTER 10 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response to this question is C, because scientists have determined that conception/fertilizationoccurs in the upper portion of the fallopian tube. A isan incorrect response because this is where implanta-tion takes place after fertilization has occurred. B is an incorrect response because this describes the innerlining of the uterus, where implantation takes place,not where fertilization of the ovum and sperm occur.D is an incorrect response because the sperm does not travel outside the fallopian tube to the ovary, butrather meets the ovum for purposes of fertilization inthe fallopian tube. 2.The correct response to this question is B, becausehCG is secreted by the formation of the zygote afterfertilization has taken place. Its presence in the mater-nal urine or serum signals a pregnancy has started. Itsabsence denotes no pregnancy. A is an incorrect re-sponse because it is not detected until weeks later,after fertilization has taken place. It is secreted by theplacenta after it is formed. C is an incorrect responsebecause FSH stimulates ovulation, but bows outonce ovulation is accomplished. D is an incorrect re-sponse because TSH, although needed to support apregnancy, has a limited affect on fertilization and itsaftermath. 3.The correct response is D. Autosomal dominant inher-itance occurs when a single gene in the heterozygous state is capable of producing the phenotype. The affected person generally has an affected parent, and anaffected person generally has a 50% chance of passingthe abnormal gene to each of his or her children. 4.The correct response to this question is C, becauseuncovering an individual's family history can identifyprevious genetic disorders that have a high risk forrecurrence in subsequent generations. A is an incor-rect response because observing a patient and his orher family would be costly and unproductive in diag-nosing a genetic disorder; observation would have totake place over several generations to yield results. B is an incorrect response because psychological test-ing might not uncover genetic predispositions to dis-orders. D is an incorrect response because excludingthe numerous genetic conditions would be a time-consuming and tedious task.782 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 5.The correct response is C. The family history plays a critical role in identifying genetic disorders. A historyof a previous child, parents, or close relative with aninherited disease, congenital abnormalities, metabolicdisorders, developmental disorders, or choromosomalabnormalities can indicate an increased risk of geneticdisorders; therefore, referral to genetic counseling isappropriate. Critical Thinking Exercise a. What information/education should this couple considerbefore deciding whether to have the test? The nurse needs to outline the facts about the genetic inheritance: CF is a recessive disorder that affects 1 in every 2500 babies. It predominantly is seen in white infants and is less common in other races. Because it is a recessive disorder, Mrs. Martin must also be a carrier to pass it on to their offspring. If Mrs. Martin is a carrier, their chance of having a child with CF is one in four. The risk is the same each time they have a child. Information about the characteristics of cystic brosis. b. How can you assist this couple in their decision-making process? Start by providing all the facts about the nature of the inheri- tance risk. Also, outline all options so the couple can make an informed decision. Options include the following: The couple does not receive genetic testing and take their chances. If Mrs. Martin is a CF carrier, then they could choose not to have children or adopt a baby. Prenatal testing could be done on the fetus to determine whether both its genes carry a CF mutation. If so, the couplecould elect to abort the pregnancy. Use an ovum or sperm from a donor who does not carry CF. Make a referral to a reproductive technology health facility for the couple to become educated regarding alternatives tomaximize their outcome. Be realistic with this couple about not having any guarantees that another genetic disorder might not occur. Discuss the expense involved in genetic testing and in vitro fertilization, which probably will not be covered by healthinsurance. c. What is your role in this situation if you do not agree with their decision? As a nurse, your role is to provide the facts and allow the couple to make their own decision about what they wish todo. They must live with their decision, not the nurse. Your roleis to respect and support whatever this couple decides to do. Study Activities 1.The video entitled Miracle of Life is a wonderful visualization of conception through fetal developmentand birth. A photographer was able to photograph11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 782sperm swimming and ovum being released from the ovary. He then photographed the developing embryoand fetal development through birth. It is realistic anda true wonder of life. The title depicts the images. 2.Depending on which website the student selects, the critique will vary. Most sites are very user friendly andare geared to the lay public's understanding. Studentswill choose their own area of interest, depending ontheir frame of reference. Their information wouldmake for an educational discussion in class. 3.Students should draw their own family pedigree toidentify their past health history. This informationis important to determine genetic conditions andinheritable diseases. By identifying their past healthancestry, perhaps motivation for wiser lifestylechoices might surface. 4.Results will vary depending on which fetal screeningtest is chosen. An example might be the fetal nuchaltranslucency screening test. The purpose of the test is to identify genetic disorders and/or physical anomalies.The procedure involves ultrasound measurement of fluid in the nape of the neck between 10 and 14 weeks'gestation. A nuchal translucency measurement of 3 mm or more is highly suggestive of fetal abnormali-ties, and diagnostic genetic testing is indicated. Thestudent playing the role of the nurse discussing thistest should be very supportive but factual with the expectant couple. They can reverse roles with a different fetal screening test to discuss. CHAPTER 11 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is B. Progesterone is an essen-tial hormone to maintain the pregnancy and preventearly labor. Progesterone decreases systemic vascularresistance early in pregnancy, leading to a decline inblood pressure. It causes relaxation of the uterus andgastrointestinal smooth muscle, resulting in delayedgastric emptying and calming of the uterus. This relaxation mechanism is vital to reduce uterine contractions. 2.The correct response is C. Urinary frequency occursduring early pregnancy secondary to pressure on thebladder by the expanding uterus. This is one of thepresumptive signs of pregnancy. Restlessness or ele-vated mood is not a sign of pregnancy. As hormonesincrease during pregnancy, the mood might change,but it is not indicative of pregnancy. Low backache isfrequently experienced by many women during thethird trimester of pregnancy secondary to the changein their center of gravity, but it is not a presumptivesign of pregnancy. 3.The correct response is A. The corpus luteum secretes hCG early after conception to signal that fertilizationhas taken place. Without fertilization, hCG is not ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 783 detected. Thus, it is the basis for pregnancy tests. hPLis the hormone secreted by the placenta to prepare thebreasts for lactation. It is also an antagonist to insulin,competing for receptor sites that force insulin secre-tion to increase to meet the body's demands. FSH is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland to stimulatethe ovary to mature an ovum for ovulation. It is notdetected during pregnancy tests. LH is secreted by thepituitary gland. An increase in LH occurs immediatelybefore ovulation and is responsible for release of theovum. It is not the basis for pregnancy tests. 4.The correct response is A. Consuming raw meatcan increase the pregnant woman's risk of picking uptoxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that can be passedon to her fetus. Although toxoplasmosis may go un-noticed in the pregnant woman, it may cause abortionor result in the birth of an infant with the disease. Uncooked shellsh may contain high levels of mercury,which can damage the fetal central nervous system.Some raw or undercooked can also be contaminatedwith Listeria, which may result in abortion, stillbirth, or severe illness of the newborn. Raw or undercookedfood items should be avoided during pregnancy. 5.The correct response is D. The feeling of ambivalenceis experienced by most women when they questiontheir ability to become a mother. Feelings fluctuatebetween happiness about the pregnancy and anxietyand fear about the prospect of new responsibilitiesand a new family member. Acceptance usually devel-ops during the second trimester after fetal movementis felt by the mother and the infant becomes real toher. Depression is not a universal feeling experiencedby most women unless there is a past history of under-lying depression experienced by the woman. Jealousyis not a universal feeling of pregnant women. It canoccur in partners, because attention is being divertedfrom them to the pregnancy and the newborn. 6.The correct response is C. Seeking acceptance of selfas mother to the infant is the basis for establishing amutually gratifying relationship between mother andinfant. This \"binding in\" is a process that changesthroughout the pregnancy, starting with the mother'sacceptance of the pregnancy and then the infant asa separate entity. Ensuring safe passage throughpregnancy, labor, and birth focuses on the motherinitially and her concern for herself. As the pregnancyprogresses, the fetus is recognized and concern for itssafety becomes a priority. The mother-infant relation-ship is not the mother's concern yet. Seeking accep-tance of this infant by others includes the world around the mother and how they will integrate this new infantinto their world. The infant-maternal relationship isnot the focus in this task. Learning to give of oneselfon behalf of one's infant focuses on delaying maternalgratication, focusing on the infant's needs before themother's needs.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 783Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. How should the nurse answer this question? The feelings that the woman is describing are those of ambivalence, and they are very common in women when they rst learn they are pregnant. The nurse needs to explain this to the woman, emphasizing that it is common for women to question themselves in relation to the pregnancy because it is \"unreal\" to them during this early period. Fetal movementhelps to make the pregnancy a reality. b. What specic information is needed to support the client during this pregnancy? The nurse can be supportive to this woman during this time by providing emotional support and validating the various am- bivalent feelings she is experiencing. Including her husbandand/or family members might also provide support for her. 2. a. What explanation can the nurse offer Sally about herdiscomforts? The nurse can explain in simple terms that the new embryo needs a great deal of her glucose and nutrients to grow, andthus her energy level will be affected during early pregnancy;this is why she is feeling tired frequently. The nurse can alsoinform her that her energy level will increase by the secondtrimester and she should not feel as drained. b. What interventions can the nurse offer to Sally? Interventions to help Sally cope with her fatigue during her early pregnancy would be for her to plan rest periods through-out the day and make sure she gets a good night's sleep daily.Taking naps on weekends to refresh her may also help her.Also, help with meal preparation would be benecial. 3. What strategies can a nurse discuss with a mother whenshe asks how to deal with this? Strategies to integrate a new infant into the family unit would include involving the sibling in planning the nursery forthe new brother or sister, answering their questions about thenew infant during the pregnancy, using age-specic books toinform the sibling of the fetus' growth and development, andproviding special time set aside to be with that sibling beforeand after the new infant arrives into the home. Study Activities 1.Depending on the information obtained by the in-terview, each symptom and/or feeling can be placedon a list and matched to the appropriate trimester.For example, fatigue, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, ambivalence =first trimester. Increased energy level, less urinary frequency, fetal movement = second trimester. Backache, frequency, introspection = third trimester.784 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 2.The student should select about three websites and present the URLs during a post conference or in agroup with a thorough description of what each sitehas to offer. 3.physiologic anemia of pregnancy 4.compression of the vena cava by the heavy gravid uterus CHAPTER 12 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is C: A nonreactive fetal heart rate is one of the biophysical prole ndings that indicates poor oxygenation to the fetus. 2.The correct response is C: Kegel exercises help totighten and strengthen pelvic floor muscles to improvetone. They can help prevent stress incontinence in women after childbirth. These exercises don'tstrengthen the perineal area on the outside to preventlacerations, but rather the internal pelvic floor muscles.Kegel exercises have nothing to do with the start oflabor for postdate infants. A drop in progesteronelevels and an increase in prostaglandins augmentlabor, not exercise. Kegel exercises don't burn calories. 3.The correct response is D. The uterus is constantlycontracting throughout pregnancy, but the contrac-tions are irregular and not usually felt by the woman,nor do they cause dilation of the cervix. BraxtonHicks contractions are not the start of early labor,since there aren't any measurable cervical changes.They are normal throughout the pregnancy, not anominous sign of an impending abortion. A woman'shydration status is not related to Braxton Hicks con-tractions; they occur regardless of her fluid status. 4.The correct response is C: the underwater pressureincurred during scuba diving may cause oxygenationchanges and a decrease in perfusion to the placenta.There is also a risk of trauma from coral reefs andboating. Swimming is an appropriate sport if thewoman does not swim alone or after a heavy meal.Walking is an appropriate exercise to promote well-being. Bike riding provides good leg exercise and isappropriate if safety precautions are observed. 5.The correct response is D: using Nagele's rule, 3 months are subtracted and 7 days are added, plus 1 year from the date of the last menstrual period. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. What subjective and objective data do you have to makeyour assessment? Subjective data: reports feeling extreme fatigue; sleeps 8 to 9 hours each night; eats poorly. Objective data: pale and tired appearance; pale mucous membranes, low H & H.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 784b. What is your impression of this woman? She is in her first trimester of pregnancy, when fatigue is a normal complaint due to the diversion of the maternal glucoseto the developing fetus. In addition, she is anemic (low H & H)due to eating habits or perhaps pica. It is important for thenurse to report this nding to the health care professional forfurther investigation of the cause. c. What nursing interventions would be appropriate for this client? Reassure her that the fatigue is a common complaint of preg- nancy in the rst trimester, but her poor dietary habits are con-tributing to her fatigue. She is anemic and needs to improve herdiet and increase the amount of iron and vitamin C she takes.She also needs to increase her ber intake to prevent consti-pation. An iron supplement might be advised by the healthcare provider to address her anemia. Request that the clientkeep a food log to bring with her to the next visit to review.A referral for nutritional counseling would be appropriate. d. How will you evaluate the effectiveness of your interventions? To assess compliance with the iron supplement, ask her what color her stools are. If they are dark, then she is taking theiron; if not, she probably isn't. Ask what dietary changes shehas made to improve her nutrition by reviewing her food logand making suggestions to increase her iron consumption.Also review the importance of good nutrition for the positiveoutcome of this pregnancy. Do another H & H level to monitorher anemia. 2. a. In addition to the routine obstetric assessments, whichadditional ones might be warranted for this teenager? Calculate Monica's body mass index (BMI) based on height and weight (BMI =17.8, which places her at high risk for not gaining enough weight during pregnancy). Ask Monica if shetakes drugs or alcohol, which might have a negative impacton the pregnancy. Request a 24-hour diet recall, which mightreveal low calorie and calcium intake. Ascertain who does thecooking and food purchasing in her house; ask that the personaccompany her to the clinic for her next visit for dietaryteaching. Explore reasons why she won't drink milk, and pro-vide her with information about other sources of calcium thatshe might substitute for milk, such as yogurt. b. What dietary instruction should be provided to this teenager based on her history? Stress the importance of gaining weight for the baby's health. Encourage her to eat three meals each day plus three high-ber snacks. Go over the Food Guide Pyramid with her to show her selections from each group that she needs to consume daily. Request that she take a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on whole-wheat bread to school to make sure she eats a goodlunch each day.ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 785 Instruct her on limiting her intake of sodas and caffeinated drinks. Encourage her to drink calcium-fortied orange juice for breakfast daily. Reinforce the importance of taking her prenatal vitamin daily.Send her home with printed materials for review. c. What follow-up monitoring should be included in subsequent prenatal visits? Increase the frequency of prenatal visits to every 2 weeks to monitor weight gain for the next few months. Refer Monicaand her mother to the nutritionist in the WIC program for amore thorough dietary instruction. Request a 24-hour dietaryrecall at each prenatal visit to provide a basis for instructionand reinforcement. 3. a. What additional information would the nurse need toassess her complaint? Ask Maria for a 24-hour food intake recall to assess what other food she eats. Ask Maria if she had this problem before becoming pregnant.Ask Maria if she takes iron supplementation in addition to her prenatal vitamin. Ask Maria how much and what kind of fluid intake she has in 24 hours. Ask Maria whether she engages in any exercise consistently. b. What interventions would be appropriate for Maria? The nurse needs to discuss with her the reasons why she is constipated: heavy gravid uterus compressing the intestines,reduced peristalsis and smooth muscle relaxation secondaryto progesterone, low ber and fluid intake, and limited exer-cise. To reduce the problem, Maria will need to make changesin the areas of food, fluid, and exercise. c. What lifestyle adaptations will Maria need to make to alleviate her constipation? Maria will need to consume high-fiber foods (fruits and vegetables) and increase her fluid intake to 2,000 mL dailyto overcome the constipation. In addition, she will need toget off the couch and get some exercise, perhaps walking.Finally, she will need to stop taking stimulant laxatives andchange to bulk-forming ones if the increase in high-fiberfoods and fluids doesn't work for her. Study Activities 1-4. The answers to activities 1 to 4 are highly individualized. 5.doula CHAPTER 13 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is A. Frequency is measured from the start of one contraction to the start of thenext contraction. The duration of a contraction is11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 785measured from the beginning of one contraction to the end of that same contraction. The intensity of twocontractions is measured by comparing the peak ofone contraction with the peak of the next contraction.The resting interval is measured from the end of onecontraction to the beginning of the next contraction. 2.The correct response is B. A longitudinal lie places the fetus in a vertical position, which would be themost conducive for a spontaneous vaginal birth. Atransverse lie does not allow for a vaginal birth becausethe fetus is lying perpendicular to the maternal spine.A perpendicular lie describes the transverse lie, which would not be conducive for a spontaneous birth. Anoblique lie would not allow for a spontaneous vaginalbirth because the fetus would not fit through thematernal pelvis in this side-lying position. 3.The correct response is C. After the placenta separates from the uterine wall, the shape of the uterus changesfrom discoid to globular. The uterus continues tocontract throughout the placental separation processand the umbilical cord continues to pulsate for severalminutes after placental separation occurs. Maternalblood pressure is not affected by placental separationbecause the maternal blood volume has increaseddramatically during pregnancy to compensate forblood loss during birth. 4.The correct response is B. Progressive cervical changes occur in true labor. This is not the casewith false labor. 5.The correct response is C. The transition phase of the rst stage of labor occurs when the contractionsare 1 to 2 minutes apart and the nal dilation is tak-ing place. The transition phase is the most difcultand, fortunately, the shortest phase for the woman,lasting approximately 1 hour in the rst birth andperhaps 15 to 30 minutes in successive births. Manywomen are not able to cope well with the intensity ofthis short period, become restless, and request painmedications. During the latent phase, contractionsare mild. The women is in early labor and able tocope with the infrequent contractions. This phasecan last hours. The active phase involves moderatecontractions that allow for a brief rest period in between, helping the woman to be able to cope with the next contraction. This phase can last hours. Theplacental expulsion phase occurs during the thirdstage of labor. After separation of the placenta fromthe uterine wall, continued uterine contractions causethe placenta to be expelled. Although this phase canlast 5 to 30 minutes, the contraction intensity is lessthan that of the transition phase. 6.The correct response is B. Cervical dilation of 6 cm indicates that the woman is in the active phase of therst stage of labor. In this phase, the cervix dilatesfrom 3 to 7 cm with 40% to 80% effacement occur-ring. During the latent phase, the cervix dilates from786 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 0 to 3 cm. During the transition phase, the cervix dilates from 8 to 10 cm. The first stage of labor is divided into three phases: latent, active, and transition.There is no early phase. 7.The correct response is C. True labor is character- ized by contractions occurring at regular intervalsthat increase in frequency, duration, and intensity.These contractions bring about progressive cervicaldilation and effacement. Thus, a cervix dilated to4 cm and 90% effaced indicates true labor. Ruptureof membranes may occur before the onset of labor, at the onset of labor, or at any time during laborand thus is not indicative of true labor. Engagementoccurs when the presenting part reaches 0 station; ittypically occurs 2 weeks before term in primigravidasand several weeks before the onset of labor or at thebeginning of labor for multiparas. Contractions oftrue labor typically last 30 to 60 seconds and occurapproximately every 4 to 6 minutes. Critical Thinking Exercises 1.a. What additional information do you need to respond appropriately? Ask about the frequency and duration of her contractions. Ask about how long she has experienced \"labor pains.\"Ask about any other signs she may have experienced such as bloody show, lightening, backache, ruptured membranes,and so forth. Ask if walking tends to increase or decrease the intensity of contractions. Ask her when she last felt fetal movement.Ask her how far away (distance) she is from the birthing center. Ask her if she has a support person in the home with her. b. What suggestions/recommendations would you make to her? Stay in the comfort of her home environment as long as possible. Advise her to walk as much as possible to see what effect it has on the contractions. Also, tell her to drink fluids tohydrate herself. Review nonpharmacologic comfort measures she can try at home. Tell her to keep in contact with the birthing center staff regarding her experience. c. What instructions need to be given to guide her decision making? Instruct her on how to time the frequency and duration of contractions. Wait until contractions are 5 minutes apart or her membranes rupture to come to the birthing center. Tell her to come to the birthing center when she cannot talk during a contraction. Reinforce all instructions with her support partner.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 786d. What other premonitory signs of labor might the nurse ask about? Has she experienced the feeling of the fetus dropping (light- ening) lower down? Has her energy level changed (increased) in the last day or so?Has she noticed any reddish discharge (bloody show) from her vagina? Has she had any episodes of diarrhea within the last 48 hours?Has her \"bag of waters\" broken or does she feel any leakage? e. What manifestations would be found if Cindy is experiencing true labor? There would be progressive dilation and effacement of her cervix if true labor is occurring. Contraction pain also would notbe relieved with walking, and the pain would start in the backand radiate around toward the front of the abdomen. Contrac-tions also would occur regularly, becoming closer together, usually 4 to 6 minutes apart, and last 30 to 60 seconds. If sheis experiencing false labor, slight effacement might be present,but not dilation. 2. Topics to address in the community education programwould include: Information about the stages of labor, including what to expect Explanation of risks and benets about any interventional pro- cedures that might be performed during the labor processANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 787 Information about the available pain relief measuresMethods of involvement and participation during the labor and birthing process by partner/doula/family member Information about variables that may alter or influence the course of labor, including preoperative teaching for cesarean birth Study Activities 1.This discussion should involve the passenger, powers, passageway, position, and psychological response of the student's assigned women goingthrough labor and how each affected the length and stages of labor. 2.Answers A, B, and E are correct. The cardinal move- ments of labor by the fetus include engagement, descent, flexion, international rotation, extension,external rotation, and expulsion only. The otherchoices describe the various fetal positions. 3.This discussion will vary depending on the women's labor and birth experience. Psychological factors that could be addressed might include previous birthexperiences, age, pregnancy discomforts, cultural beliefs, expectations for this birth experience, prep-aration for birth, and effectiveness and participationof support system. 4.See the following gure. For duration, the \"X\" is placed at the start of one contraction and at the end of it. Duration CHAPTER 14 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is D: intermittent pushing with each contraction is more effective than continuouspushing, which reduces perfusion to the placenta.Holding the breath and pushing through the entirecontraction is incorrect because this action reducesblood flow and oxygenation to the uterus and to thefetus. Chest breathing is not an effective breathing pat-tern to increase intra-abdominal pressure, which assiststhe contraction to expel the fetus. Panting and blowingis used between contractions to abstain from pushing. 2.The correct response is B: a full bladder causes displacement of the uterus above it, and increasedbleeding results secondary to the uncontracted statusof the uterus. Massaging the uterus will help to make it rm but will not help to bring it back into the mid-line, since the full bladder is occupying the space itwould normally assume. Notifying the primary healthcare provider is not necessary unless the womancontinues to have difficulty voiding and the uterusremains displaced. The normal location of the uterusin the fourth stage of labor is in the midline. Dis-placement suggests a full bladder, which is not considered a normal finding. 3.The correct response is C: the entire focus of the labor and birth experience is for the family to makedecisions, not the caretakers. The nurse's role is torespect and support those decisions. Decisions aboutpain management are not based on length of the vari-ous stages of labor, but rather on what provides effec-tive pain relief for the laboring woman. Pain-relief11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 787measures differ. Each individual responds differently and uniquely to various pain-relief measures. Notrecommending nonpharmacologic measures demon-strates bias on the nurse's part; it is not the nurse'sdecision to make, but rather the client's. 4.The correct response is A: several professional women's health organizations have published guide-lines concerning the timing of intermittent FHR assess- ments during the active stage of labor. The currentrecommendation is that intermittent FHR is assessedevery 15 minutes during the active phase of labor. 5.The correct response is C: fetal accelerations denote an intact central nervous system and appropriate oxygenation levels demonstrated by an increase inheart rate associated with fetal movement. Accelera-tions are a reassuring pattern, so no intervention isneeded. Turning the woman on her left side would be an appropriate intervention for a late decelerationpattern. Administering 100% oxygen via face mask would be appropriate for a late or variable decelera-tion pattern. Since fetal accelerations are a reassuringpattern, no orders are needed from the health careprovider, nor does the health care provider need tobe notied of this reassuring pattern. Critical Thinking Exercises 1.a. Based on your assessment data and the woman's requestnot to have medication, what nonpharmacologic interven-tions could you offer her? Progressive relaxation techniques of locating, then releasing tension from one muscle group at a time until the entirebody is relaxed Visual imagery such as taking a journey in the woman's mind to a relaxing place that is far away from the discomfortof labor Music to bring about a calming effect as well as a distrac- tion or attention focusing to divert attention away from thelaboring process; focusing on sound or rhythm helps releasetension and promote relaxation Massage/acupressure to enhance relaxation, improve circu- lation, and reduce pain in labor; counterpressure on thelower back to help relieve back pain Breathing techniques for effective attention-focusing strategies to enhance coping mechanisms during labor b. What positions might be suggested to help facilitate fetal descent? Upright positions such as walking, swaying, slow-dancing with her partner, or leaning over a birthing ball will all enhance comfort and use the force of gravity to facilitatefetal descent. Kneeling and leaning forward will help relieve back pain. Pelvic rocking on hands and knees and lunging with one foot elevated on a chair may help with internal fetal rota-tion and speed a slow labor.788 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 2. a. What assessment needs to be done to determine what ishappening? The nurse should perform a vaginal examination to validate that she is in the transition phase (8 to 10 cm dilated). b. What explanation can you offer Carrie's partner regarding her change in behavior? Explain to her partner that she is in the transition phase of the rst stage of labor and that her behavior is typical, sinceshe is having hard contractions frequently. Reassure himnot to take Carrie's comments personally, but to stay andbe supportive to her. Study Activities 1.This information will vary depending on what the woman reports to the student. Unrealistic pain-management plans need to be identified and validevidence-based ones presented to the woman. Misconceptions can be cleared up also. 2.Acceleration \u2014elevation of FHR above the baseline; a reassuring pattern 3.The findings will vary from facility to facility, but the student might find a more liberal use of non-pharmacologic techniques in the birthing centercompared to the hospital setting and more frequentuse of hydrotherapy and ambulation to relieve discomfort. Also, intermittent assessment using a hand-held Doppler is probably used more fre-quently in the birthing center compared to the hospital, where continuous electronic fetal monitor-ing is prevalent. 4.Many childbirth websites present very basic informa- tion about childbirth and attempt to target a wide audience of educational levels. Many of these sitespromote various pregnancy and infant products. CHAPTER 15 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is A. Engorgement refers to the swelling of the breast tissue as a result of an in-crease in blood and lymph supply to produce milkfor the newborn. Estrogen and progesterone levelsdecrease considerably and are not restored until thefirst menses returns several weeks or months later,depending on the lactation status of the mother.Colostrum can be secreted as early as 16 weeks'gestation. The mother's body is going through profuse diuresis to restore prepregnant fluid levelsto her body and therefore would not be retainingfluid in the breasts. 2.The correct response is C. According to Reba Rubin, the mother is very passive and is dependent on others11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 788to care for her for the rst 24 to 48 hours after giving birth. Gaining self-condence would characterize amother in the taking-hold phase, during which themother demonstrates mastery over her own body'sfunctioning and feels more condent in caring for hernewborn. Adjustment to relationships does not occuruntil the third phase, letting go, when the motherbegins to separate from the symbiotic relationship she and her newborn enjoyed during pregnancy andbirth. Resuming control over her life would denotethe second phase of taking hold, during which themother does resume control over her life and gainsself-condence in her newborn care. 3.The correct response is D. The direct cause of after- pains is uterine contractions. Mothers experienceabdominal pain secondary to contractions, especially when breast-feeding because sucking stimulates therelease of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland,which causes uterine contractions. Manipulation of the uterus during labor would only occur duringa surgical birth, and this discomfort would not besustained weeks later. The size of the infant might cause additional stretching of the uterus, but it is notthe underlying cause of the afterpains. Pregnanciesspaced too close together can contribute to frequentstretching of the uterus, but this is not the cause ofafterpains. 4.The correct response is B. Lochia discharge from the uterus proceeds in an orderly fashion, regardless of asurgical or vaginal birth. Its color changes from red topink to whitish cream consistently, unless there is acomplication. The correct sequence is rubra (red),then serosa (pink), and then alba (white, creamy). 5.The correct response is C. The nurse would expect light pink or brown lochia, and the uterus should befour to ve ngerbreadths below the umbilicus. 6.The correct answer would be: 1, sleep and rest; 2, interaction time with the infant to facilitate bonding;3, lessons on holding and cuddling the infant; 4, ababy bath demonstration given by the nurse. Critical Thinking Exercises 1.a. Is there something \"wrong\" with Ms Grifn's behavior?Why or why not? No, this is typical behavior for a new mother within the rst 2 days after giving birth. b. What maternal role phase is being described by the new nurse? This behavior is characteristic of Reba Rubin's taking-in phase, which covers the rst 48 hours after childbirth. The new mother is typically focused on her own needs for rest, food, and comfort.New mothers in this phase tend to be passive and take directions/suggestions well from staff. Preoccupation with them-ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 789 selves rather than their newborns is normal during this phase. Their needs must be met before they can begin to care for others. c. What role can the nurse play to support the mother through this phase? The nurse can be supportive through this early phase by pro- viding a restful, quiet environment to facilitate her recoveryfrom childbirth. Providing her with simple guidance and sug-gestions of how she can care for herself and her newborn willassist the new mother in expanding her focus. Praising her forher accomplishments in care will reinforce it. 2. a. Would you consider Mr. Lenhart's paternal behavior tobe normal at this time? Yes, inexperienced rst-time fathers are anxious around their newborns because this is a new experience for them and manydo not know how to handle or care for their newborns yet.Paternal attachment is a gradual process that occurs overweeks and months. b. What might Mr. Lenhart be feeling at this time? He is probably feeling overwhelmed with this tiny baby and, although he probably wants to help, he is anxious about howor what to do without appearing awkward. c. How can the nurse help this new father adjust to his new role? The nurse can help new fathers adjust to their role by taking time to listen to their concerns and demonstrating how theycan become involved in the care of their newborn. Staying inthe room and physically supporting the father as he tries outhis new role will provide encouragement for him to becomeinvolved. The nurse can slowly introduce fathers to the careneeds of their newborn and encourage their participation. Thissupportive role by the nurse can help reduce role strain andenhance family adjustment.

Periodic crying and insom- nia are characteristic of postpartum blues, in additionto mood changes, irritability, and increased sensitivity.Panic attacks and suicidal thoughts or anger towardself and the infant would be descriptive of postpartumpsychosis, when some women turn this anger towardthemselves and have committed suicide or infanticide.Women experiencing postpartum blues do not losetouch with reality. Obsessive thoughts and halluci-nations would be more descriptive of postpartumpsychosis. 2.The correct response is D. Nurses need first to become educated about various cultural practicesto incorporate them into their care delivery. Bygaining an understanding of diverse cultures differ-ent from their own, nurses can become sensitive to these different practices and not violate them.Attending a transcultural course might be benefi-cial, but this would take several weeks to completeand the information is needed much sooner to provide culturally sensitive care for an admitted patient and her family. Caring only for families ofthe nurse's cultural origin would not be possible orrealistic in our global, culturally diverse populationwithin the United States. Nurses need to care forevery person regardless of their color, creed, or nationality with respect and competence. Teachingdiverse cultural families Western beliefs woulddemonstrate ethnocentric behavior and would notbe professional. Each culture needs to be respectedand learned about with tolerance and understanding. 3.The correct response is B. Because weight loss is based on the principle of intake of calories and output of energy, instructing this woman to avoidhigh-calorie foods that yield no nutritive value andexpending more energy through active exercise wouldresult in weight loss for her. Acid-producing foods(plums, cranberries, and prunes) are typically recom-mended for women to prevent urinary tract infectionsto acidify the urine, not for weight-loss purposes.Increasing fluid intake (water) would be good forweight loss because it lls the stomach and reduceshunger sensations; however, this option does notidentify which fluids should be increased. Increasinghigh-calorie juice and soda drinks would be counter-productive to weight-loss measures. Fluid restrictioncombined with a high-protein diet would increasethe risk of gout and formation of kidney stones.Carbohydrates are needed by the body to makeATP and convert it to energy for cellular processes.Limiting snacks might be a good suggestion dependingon which ones are selected. Raw fruits and vegetables790 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS are excellent high-ber snacks that will help in an overall weight-loss program. 4.The correct response is C. Lactating mothers need an extra 500 calories to sustain breast-feeding. Anadditional 20 g of protein is also needed to helpbuild and regenerate body cells for the lactatingwoman. Additional intake of carbohydrates or ber isnot suggested for lactation. An increase in fats is notrecommended, nor is it needed for breast-feeding. Toobtain adequate amounts of vitamins during lacta-tion, women are encouraged to choose a varied dietthat includes enriched and fortied grains and cere-als, fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean meats anddairy products. An increase in vitamins via supple-ments is not recommended. Choosing a variety offoods from the food pyramid will provide the lactat-ing women with adequate iron and minerals. 5.The correct response is D. A swollen, tender area on the breast would indicate mastitis, which would needmedical intervention. Fatigue and irritability are notcomplications of childbearing, but rather the normduring the early postpartum period secondary to infant care demands and lack of sleep on the care-taker's part. Perineal discomfort and lochia serosa are normal physiologic events after childbirth and indicate normal uterine involution. Bradycardia is a normal vital sign for several days after childbirth because of the dramatic circulatory changes that takeplace with the loss of the placenta at birth and the return of blood back to the central circulation. 6.The correct response is A. Desiring to be in close proximity to another human being is all part of thebonding process. Bonding cannot take place withseparation of individuals. Closeness is needed by thetwo people bonding, and not having others hold theinfant. Buying or wearing expensive clothes has noemotional effect on a bonding relationship. Request-ing that nurses provide care separates the parent fromthe infant and suggests that the parents lack the desirefor closeness with their infant. 7.The correct response is C. An older sibling needs to feel they are still loved and not upstaged by the newestfamily member. Allowing special time for that siblingreinforces the parent's love for them also. Regressionbehavior is common when there is stress in that sibling's life, and punishing him brings attention tonegative behavior, possibly reinforcing it. The older sibling might feel he or she is being replaced and isnot wanted by the parents when he or she is sentaway. Including the older sibling in the care of thenewborn is a better way to incorporate the newestmember into the family unit. Sharing a room withthe infant could lead to feelings of displacement in thesibling. In addition, frequent interruptions during theday and night will awaken the sibling and not allow afull night's sleep or undisturbed nap.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 7908.The correct response is A. Home visits are usually made within the rst week of discharge to assess themother and newborn. This visit is made primarily toprovide the nurse with the opportunity to recognizecommon biomedical and psychosocial problems orcomplications. Although not the primary reason, thisvisit also offers an opportunity to provide supportand guidance to the parents in making the adjust-ment to the change in their lives. The home visit isnot the time to complete PKU testing or completethe birth certicate. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. What is your nursing assessment of this encounter? Nursing observations would indicate poor bonding/ attachment behaviors between mother and infant based on Disinterest in holding or being close to infant Lack of concern for infant's needs More concerned about phone conversation Negative comment about newborn (\"monkey\") b. What nursing interventions would be appropriate? Assess for risk factors in the client\u2014age, outside family support, multiple life stressors, unrealistic expectations ofnewborn behaviors, level of education, family support system\u2014and determine the client's perception of newborn behaviorsand educate her about normal newborn behaviors andmothering activities needed. In addition, model parent carebehaviors in caring for a newborn and ascertain the availabilityof any family support\u2014extended family, neighbors, andcommunity resources. c. What specic discharge interventions may be needed? Based on observations and assessment data, this client would need a referral to the discharge planner, social services depart- ment, or local health department for home visit follow-up care. Bonding/attachment behaviors are lacking, possibly placing the newborn at risk for neglect or abuse. 2. a. Which of these assessment ndings warrants further investigation? Tearful client pacing the floor holding her crying son Distended bladder upon palpation; reporting frequency Fundus rm and displaced to right of midline b. What interventions are appropriate at this time and why? It is apparent that Jennifer is overwhelmed and does not seem to be coping well with her new parenting role. She maybe experiencing postpartum blues as well. She needs supportduring this critical period. The home care nurse needs to ascertain what family or support systems are available andmake contact with them for help. Questioning Jennifer aboutANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 791 previous crying episodes or feeling \"down\" recently is in order to ascertain whether she is feeling the \"blues\" in addition to being overwhelmed. If limited resources are available, assign-ing a home health aide to come daily to assist Jennifer mightbe needed. Counseling and active listening will be helpfulduring the home care visit. The uterine fundus is displaced out of the midline as a result of a distended bladder. The bladder needs to be emptied forthe uterus to assume midline positioning. Jennifer's urinary frequency may be the result of distention secondary to poorbladder tone or a developing urinary tract infection. The nurseshould attempt to get Jennifer to void on her own and obtaina clean-catch urine specimen. Checking for bacteria with achemical reagent strip (\"dipstick\") is appropriate. Institutingmeasures to promote voiding\u2014tap running, forcingfluids, and cranberry juice\u2014also would be appropriate inter-ventions. If a bacterium is found in the clean-catch urinespecimen, calling Jennifer's health care provider to obtain an order for medication would be necessary. Otherwise, advisingJennifer to increase her fluid intake and voiding frequently toempty her bladder would be in order. c. What health teaching is needed before you leave this home? Information about postpartum blues should be discussed, em- phasizing that it is benign and self-limiting. Assuring Jenniferthat this is very common and allowing time for her to vent herfrustrations and express her feelings can be very therapeutic.Increasing awareness about postpartum blues can bring it intofocus and help her understand this event in her life. In addition,self-care and newborn care measures that allow Jennifer to restneed to be outlined. Suggesting that Jennifer nap when thebaby sleeps throughout the day is a start. Attempting to clusterbaby care (bathing, feeding, and dressing) might give her addi-tional time for herself. Calling on friends and family to help outshould be stressed. Other interventions would include: Reassurance that her mothering ability is fine and the newborn is healthy Referral to community home health agency to gain home health aide assistance Discussions concerning accepting help and support from others Times and dates of follow-up care appointments Community resources available to assist her through this time 3. a. What response by the nurse would be appropriate atthis time? Reply in a sensitive, nonjudgmental manner that this bottle of formula has been sitting out for 3 hours since the last feedingand has not been refrigerated. It may be contaminated andwould not be appropriate to feed her baby with now. b. What action should the nurse take? Take the old bottle of formula and tell Lisa that you will get her a fresh bottle for this feeding. Leave the room with theformula bottle and replace it with another one.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 791c. What health teaching is needed for Lisa prior to discharge? A thorough explanation is needed about feeding practices, emphasizing that formula is milk and needs to be refriger-ated when not being used for feeding at that time. Leavingformula sit at room temperature for long periods increasesthe risk of bacterial contamination and may give her infantgastroenteritis. In addition, as the infant grows, more formulawill be consumed at each feeding, and making up an approxi-mate amount that will be consumed will become easier for her to avoid waste.

Wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the bathroom. 4.engorgement CHAPTER 17 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is B. The behaviors demonstrated by the newborn, such as alertness, stabilized heartand respiratory rates, and passage of meconium areassociated with the second period of reactivity. Therst period of reactivity starts with a period of quietalertness followed by an active alertness with frequentbursts of movement and crying. During the decreasedresponsiveness period, also called the sleep period, the newborn is relatively unresponsive and difficultto waken. 2.The correct response is C. Convection is loss of heat from an object to the environment. Using the port-holes instead of opening the isolette door preventsrapid heat loss from the inside of the isolette. Thisaction also protects the newborn from drafts. Evapo-ration is the loss of heat as water is lost from the skinto the environment. Keeping the newborn dry willprevent this type of heat loss. Conduction is thetransfer of heat from one object to another when indirect contact, such as placing a newborn onto acold scale to be weighed. Radiation is the loss ofheat between objects that are not in direct contact,792 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS such as a cold window near the newborn's isolette. 3.The correct response is D. Evaporation is the loss of heat as water is lost from the skin to the environment.Drying the newborn at birth and after bathing, keep-ing linens dry, and using plastic wrap blankets andheat shields will all prevent heat loss through evapo-ration. Placing the newborn on a warmed surface willprevent heat loss via conduction. Maintaining a warmroom temperature will prevent heat loss via convec-tion. Transporting the newborn in an isolette willprevent heat loss via radiation. 4.The correct response is A. The foramen ovale is the fetal structure within the heart that allows blood tocross immediately to the left side and bypass thepulmonary circuit. When left-side pressure gradientsincrease at birth, this opening closes, thereby estab- lishing an extrauterine circulation pattern. The duc-tus venosus is not located in the heart; it is locatedbetween the umbilical vein and the inferior venacava, and it shunts blood away from the liver duringfetal life. The ductus arteriosus connects the pul-monary artery to the aorta to bypass the pulmonary circuit. It begins to constrict as pulmonary circulationincreases and arterial oxygen tension increases. Theumbilical vein, along with two umbilical arteries, ispart of the umbilical cord that is cut at birth. 5.The correct answer is newborn D. Normal breathing can be described as shallow, at a rate of 36 bpm, withshort periods of apnea. 6.The correct answer is C. The ndings indicate a patent anus with no bowel obstruction and normalperistalsis. Critical Thinking Exercises 1.a. What is your impression of this behavior? It is evident the new nurse's behaviors demonstrate a lack of awareness or knowledge about thermoregulation in newborns.Reinforcement of these principles is needed. Perhaps she needs to be reminded of newborns' inability to keep them-selves warm as a result of a variety of factors, or perhaps she may feel overwhelmed with caring for more than one new-born at a time. An in-service for all nursery personnel mightbe a good reinforcement of this concept. b. What principles concerning thermoregulation need to be reinforced? All four. The nurse is subjecting the newborn to heat loss by all four methods\u2014evaporation (bathing), radiation (leavingdoor open), convection (cap off), and conduction (weighing). Newborns are unable to conserve body heat and experience heat loss through four mechanisms: conduction, convection, evaporation, and radiation. Placing newborns on cold surfaceswithout any protection (such as a blanket or cover) will causethem to lose body heat via conduction. By exposing them11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 792while wet, such as during bathing, heat is lost through evapo- ration. Leaving the storage room open permits cool air flowover the newborn, allowing heat loss by convection. Placingthe infant transporter near cold rooms allows for transfer ofneonatal body heat via radiation. c. How will you evaluate whether your instructions have been effective? The effectiveness of the in-service can be evaluated by observing the behavior of the staff while caring for thenewborns. Hopefully, the principles reinforced during thediscussion will be applied in the handling of the newborns.For the new nurse, it would be important to observe thenurse covering the newborn when bathing, placing awarmed blanket on the scale prior to weighing, closinghallway doors to prevent drafts, and keeping a cap on the newborn's head when showing him or her to the parents. In addition, the nurse should verbalize why she is performing all these actions. 2. A. Suction the mouth and then the nose to remove any mucus.Stimulate crying by drying the newborn immediately afterbirth. Assess respiratory effort to validate that it is withinnormal parameters. Observe for signs of respiratory distress.Auscultate chest for gas for normal gas exchange. B. Safety measures include matching identication bracelets for motherand infant; footprinting the newborn and thumbprinting themother for identication purposes as well as prevention ofabduction; handling the newborn with both hands securely toprevent dropping; positioning the newborn on his or her backto sleep; frequent handwashing when handling all newborns.C. Provide warmth by placing a hat on the newborn's headto prevent heat loss through the scalp. Take and record thenewborn's axillary temperature frequently to monitor thermo-regulation. Keep the newborn away from drafts and wrap in ablanket to keep warm or place under a radiant heater. Aftertemperature stabilizes, bathe the newborn. Study Activities 1.First period of reactivity behavior: burst of rapid, jerky movements of the extremities; sucking activity;smacking and rooting; and ne tremors of the extrem-ities. Second period behavior: newborn's alertnessgradually declines and he or she sleeps. Third period:newborns awaken and become more interactive withthe environment. Movement is smoother comparedwith the rst period of reactivity. Meconium may bepassed during this period. 2.Initially the heart rate immediately on admission to the nursery would be high (120-180 bpm), but afterseveral hours it typically will decline (120-140 bpm).The respiratory rate will be rapid (60-80 bpm), withperiods of apnea lasting 5 seconds or less. After severalhours, the respiratory rate will decline (30-50 bpm)ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 793 and periods of apnea will become less frequent. Thetemperature of the newly admitted newborn may beon the low end of normal (36.5-37 \u00b0C) if there has been no hypothermia while transporting the newbornfrom the birthing area. After being under a radiantheat source for several hours and not exposed todrafts or moisture, the temperature should be in themid range of temperature norms. If the temperatureremains stabilized, a bath can be given. 3.American Academy of Pediatrics, www.aap.org; Neonatal Network, www.neonatalwork.com 4.evaporation CHAPTER 18 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is D. One point would be sub- tracted for color (acrocyanosis) and 1 point for fairflexion of extremities. All the assessment parametersshould rate 2 points, except for color and flexion.Therefore, any score except 8 points would be incorrect. 2.The correct response is D. Phototherapy reduces the bilirubin on the newborn's skin via oxidation.Phototherapy does not affect surfactant levels in thenewborn's lungs, nor does it help to stabilize tempera-tures in the newborn. In fact, it might cause hyperther-mia at times if not monitored closely. Phototherapy cannot destroy Rh antibodies attached to RBCswithin the circulation. 3.The correct response is B. Vitamin K is needed for blood clotting and is a vital component of the blood-clotting cascade. The newborn's gut is sterile at birthand unable to manufacture vitamin K on its ownwithout an outside source initially. Vitamin K hasno impact on bilirubin conjugation, transport, orexcretion. It is not involved in closing the foremanovale; cutting the cord and changing gradient vascularpressures are responsible for this closure. Vitamin Khas no influence over the digestive process of com-plex proteins. 4.The correct response is A. The eyes of newborns can be exposed to gonorrhea and/or chlamydial organisms if they are present in the mother's vagina during the birth process, possibly resultingin a severe infection and blindness. Therefore, eyeprophylaxis is administered. Thrush and Entero- bacter typically do not affect the eyes. Thrush develops in the newborn's mouth after exposure to maternal vaginal yeast infections during the birth process. Infections with Staphylococcus and syphilis are contracted through blood stream exposure or via the placenta and not by contactwith the maternal vagina during birth. Eye treat-ment would not impact/treat either infectious11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 793process. Hepatitis B and herpes are not treatable with eye ointment. 5.The correct response is C. Research has identied sleeping position and its link to SIDS. Since 1992,the AAP has recommended that all newborns beplaced on their backs to sleep. This recommendationhas reduced the incidence of SIDS dramatically. Respiratory distress syndrome involves a lack of surfactant in the lungs, not sleeping position. The intake of formula or juice (high lactose exposure)being allowed to sit in the infant's mouth during sleep is the cause of bottle mouth syndrome. Positioningon the back might aggravate the GI regurgitation syndrome rather than help it. 6.The correct response is D. Most newborns are started on the hepatitis B series before discharge from thehospital and receive the remaining two immunizationsat 1 month and 4 to 6 months of age. The pneumo-coccal vaccine is given between 2 to 23 months ofage, not at birth. Varicella immunization is not givenuntil 12 to 18 months of age. Hepatitis A immuniza-tion is recommended for children and adolescents inselected states and regions and for high-risk groups.It is not a universal vaccine for all children. 7.The correct response is C. Ingestion of certain amino acids found in breast milk or formula must be accu-mulated in the newborn to identify a deciency in anenzyme that cannot metabolize them. If the PKU testis done prior to 24 to 48 hours after feeding, it mustbe repeated after the infant has tolerated feedings forat least that length of time. Identifying hypothyroidismis not linked to ingesting protein feedings. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic inherited condition not related to protein intake. Sickle cell disease is a geneticallyinherited condition unrelated to protein ingestionin the newborn. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. How should the nurse respond to Ms. Scott's questions? In a calm manner, explain to Ms. Scott that all her observations are normal variations and address each one separately: \"Banana-shaped head\"\u2014is molding where the newbornhad a slight overriding of the skull bones to navigate thebony pelvis and birth canal during the birth process \"Mushy\" feel to head\u2014caput succedaneum, which is anedematous area of the scalp as a result of sustained pres- sure of the occiput against the cervix during labor and birthprocess \"White spots on nose\"\u2014milia, which are plugged, distended,small, white sebaceous glands that are present in mostnewborns and should not be squeezed by the mother \"Blue bruises on buttocks\"\u2014Mongolian spots, which arebluish black areas of pigmentation that are common inAfrican-Americans and have no clinical signicance, butcan be mistaken for bruises794 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS b. What additional newborn instruction might be appropriate at this time? At this time, it might be appropriate for the nurse to unwrap the newborn and complete a thorough bedside assessment, pointingout any minor deviations to the mother and explaining their sig-nicance. This will allay any future anxiety about her newbornand will afford the opportunity to instruct Ms. Scott on variousphysiologic and behavioral adaptations present in her daughter. c. What reassurance can be given to Ms. Scott regarding her daughter's appearance? One can assume that Ms. Scott's concern is that these various normal deviations might be permanent. The nurse can identifyeach and provide reassurance about their approximate time ofdisappearance: Molding\u2014transient in nature and should disappear within 72 hours Caput succedaneum\u2014disappears spontaneously within 3 to4 days Milia\u2014will clear up spontaneously within the rst month Mongolian spots\u2014will gradually fade during the first orsecond year 2. a. What impact does an infant abduction have on the familyand the hospital? The abduction of an infant is a devastating event that poses signicant emotional, legal, and nancial risks to both thefamily and the hospital. The sudden, unexpected loss of an infant followed by an innite period of uncertainty concern-ing the child's well-being places the traumatized family incrisis. The hospital typically will change its security systems,policies, and procedures; heighten supervision; and increaseaccountability for all staff. b. What security measure was the weak link in the chain of security? The woman was able to pass into the hospital via the emer- gency room posing as a \"nurse\" without anyone checking hername tag. The security cameras were not working at the time of the abduction. This allowed the abductor to pass down the hall with the infant unnoticed and unrecorded. The nurses on the unit were unaware of this woman on their unit, which should not happen. There should be an alarm on the doors leading into the unit and the doors should remain locked and only be opened electronically by a staff member on the unitafter the person has been identied. There was truly a break-down of several security measures in this scenario. c. What can hospitals do to prevent infant abduction? Keys to infant security are awareness and education. The hospital staff should attend annual in-services on thesemeasures and participate in a mock infant-abduction drillto heighten awareness of infant security. Specially color-coded staff badges should be worn by all obstetrics staff, and par-ents should be instructed not to give their newborn to anyonewithout that specic color badge. the infant's ankle and wristbands. Everyone must work together to keep all infants safe. Study Activities 1.The discussion of newborn changes noticed will vary from student to student, depending on the interviewinformation obtained from the new mother. 2.This discussion will vary depending on questions asked during the bath demonstration as well as eachindividual mother's response to it. 3.The La Leche League website is lled with helpful information with pictures to assist new mothers withbreast-feeding. Each student will have his or her ownopinion about how helpful the website is and whateducational level it addresses. 4.The risks of benefits circumcision include prevention of penilecancer, decreased incidence of UTIs and STIs, andpreservation of male body consistent with father andpeers where the procedure is common. Students willexpress their own opinions about their thoughts basedon their value systems and cultural backgrounds. CHAPTER 19 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is A. Magnesium sulfate is a central nervous system depressant that interferes withcalcium uptake in the cells of the myometrium, thusreducing the muscular ability to contract. Magnesiumsulfate is not used as supplementation during preg-nancy because most pregnant women do not have adeciency of this mineral. Magnesium sulfate wouldnot be effective against constipation in pregnantwomen. Magnesium sulfate does not stimulate mus-culoskeletal tone to augment labor contractions;rather, it has the opposite effect. 2.The correct response is B. When the placenta separates from the uterine wall, it causes irritation and bleedinginto the muscle bers, which causes pain. Painless,bright-red bleeding indicates placenta previa sympto-matology. nausea and vomiting would becharacteristic of hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyper-tension and headache would be associated with gestational hypertension. 3.The correct response is A. Any time there is a preg- nancy with the chance of maternal and fetal bloodmixing, RhoGAM is needed to prevent sensitizationor antibody production. Head injury resulting from acar crash is not a situation in which there would bemixing of fetal or maternal blood. The trauma wouldcause hemorrhage, but not a sensitization reaction. Ablood transfusion after would require typ-ing of the client's blood; thus, sheANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 795 would receive blood with her own Rh factor, not onewith Rh-positive blood. Because the articial insemi-nation procedure was unsuccessful, no pregnancy oc-curred and RhoGAM would not be necessary. 4.The correct response is C. The woman should avoid noxious stimuli such as strong flavors, odors, or per-fumes because they might trigger nausea and vomiting. 5.The correct response is B. an inevitable abortion is characterized by vaginal bleeding that is greater thanslight, rupture of membranes, cervical dilation, strongabdominal cramping, and possible passage of prod-ucts of conception. The threatened abortion involves slight vaginal bleeding, no cervical dilation and nochange in cervical consistency, mild abdominal cramp-ing, a closed cervical os, and no passage of fetal tissue.An incomplete abortion involves intense abdominal cramping, heavy vaginal bleeding, and cervical dilation.A missed abortion involves the absence of contractionsand irregular spotting with possible progression toinevitable abortion. Critical Thinking Exercises 1.a. What is your impression of this condition? From her history, it appears she has hyperemesis gravidarum, because she is beyond the morning sickness time frame(6-12 weeks) and her symptoms are continual. b. What risk factors does Suzanne have? Her risk factors include young age and primigravida status. c. What intervention is appropriate for this woman? Question Suzanne further concerning previous eating patterns and food intake. Ask what measures she has used at home to stop the nauseaand vomiting. Consult the health care provider concerning hospitalizationof Suzanne for IV therapy to correct hypovolemia and elec-trolyte imbalances. If home care is in order, advise her to avoid the intake ofgreasy or highly seasoned foods and to separate food fromfluid intake; instruct her on antiemetic medication orderedand possible side effects; and instruct her to return to theclinic if symptoms do not subside within 48 hours. 2. a. What risk factors does Gloria have that increase her riskfor gestational hypertension? Gloria is a primigravida with a family history of preeclampsia (her sister). She also is an obese woman who is older than 35 years of age. Her diet of fast foods is most likely inadequatein nutritional content. She is also African-American. b. When assessing Gloria, what assessment ndings would lead the nurse to suspect that Gloria has developed severepreeclampsia?11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 795With severe preeclampsia, blood pressure is higher than 160/110 mm Hg on two occasions at least 6 hours apart, pro- teinuria is greater than 500 mg in 24 hours, and oliguria (less than 500 mL in 24 hours) is present. Other assessment ndingsmay include pulmonary edema, cerebral or visual disturbances (altered level of consciousness, headache, blurred vision, andscotomata), hyperreflexia, and epigastric or right upper quad-rant abdominal test ndings would includeincreased hematocrit, creatinine, and uric acid levels, throm-bocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Study Activities 1.Hopefully the signs and symptoms would be taught to women during their rst trimester, and writtenmaterial would be handed out too. During each pre-natal visit, the information should be reinforced tomake sure women understand what they are andwhat to do about them if they should occur. 2.Appropriate Internet sites might include Side- lines High Risk Pregnancy Support Office(www.sidelines.org) and Resolve through Sharing (http://www.ectopicpregnancy.com). 3.ectopic 4.choriocarcinoma 5.Various activities for the woman on prolonged bed rest at home could include watching TV, reading,visiting computer sites with chat rooms, talking onthe telephone, playing cards or engaging in crafts,having visitors in frequently, and completing educa-tional courses online. The woman could also use thetime to develop lists for managing the house while onbed rest, read or play games with her other children,and expand her knowledge related to the upcomingbirth of her babies. CHAPTER 20 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is B: levels of the hormone hPL (insulin antagonist) progressively rise through-out pregnancy, and additional insulin is needed toovercome its resistance. Having a carbohydrate crav-ing is not associated with gestational diabetes. Hyper-insulinemia in the fetus develops in response to themother's high blood glucose levels. Glucose levelsare diverted across the placenta for fetal use, and thusmaternal levels are reduced in the rst trimester. Thislower glucose level doesn't last throughout the ges-tation, just the first trimester. For the remainingtwo trimesters, the maternal glucose levels are highbecause of the insulin resistance caused by hPL. 2.The correct response is D: a pregnant woman with asthma who is having an acute exacerbation will be poorly oxygenated, and thus perfusion to theplacenta is compromised. Immediate treatment is796 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS needed for her well-being as well as that of the fetus. Corticosteroids are used as a first-line drugtherapy for asthma treatment and management because of their anti-inflammatory properties. Havingasthma has no influence on the woman's glucoselevels, unless she also has diabetes. Bronchodilatorsusually are inhaled, not given subcutaneously, so instruction about this route of administration wouldnot be necessary. 3.The correct response is B: extreme nausea and vomiting as part of hyperemesis gravidarum wouldcause fluid and electrolyte imbalances and wouldalter blood levels tremendously. With pla-centa previa, the placenta is dislocated, not malfunc- tioning; it would not have as much of an impact onthe pregnancy as would an imbalance of fluids andelectrolytes. Abruptio placentae would place themother at risk for hemorrhage, but the placenta doesnot govern the blood glucose levels of the mother.Rh incompatibility affects the fetus, not the mother,by causing hemolysis of the red blood cells in thefetus. This process would not influence the mother'sglucose levels. 4.The correct response is C: alcohol ingested by the woman during pregnancy is teratogenic to the fetus,and the newborn can be born with fetal alcohol spec-trum disorder. Drinking alcohol would decrease pro-duction of dehydrogenase, an enzyme that mobilizesthe hydrogen of a substrate so that it can pass it to ahydrogen acceptor. Becoming intoxicated faster dur-ing pregnancy is not the underlying problem associ-ated with alcohol ingestion and pregnancy. Thewoman's genetic makeup, how much alcohol is in-gested, her amount of body fat, metabolic rate, andingestion of food are a few of the factors that deter-mine the metabolism of alcohol. Alcohol containscalories and if enough is ingested along with food,weight gain would occur, not weight loss. 5.The correct response is B: the highest percentage of HIV transmission results from sexual activity,followed by intravenous drug use. Transmissioncan occur despite a low viral load in the blood ofthe infected person. Pregnant women who take anti-retroviral therapy during their gestation signicantlyreduce the chances of transmitting HIV to their new-born. The use of standard precautions will minimizethe risk of transmission of HIV to health care workers.A very small percentage of nurses contract HIVthrough needlesticks if using appropriate precautions. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. What additional information will you need to providecare for her? Explore her typical daily dietary intake. Ask her if there is a family history of diabetes mellitus.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 796Take her vital signs, weight, and fetal heart rate. Assess her coping abilities and capacity for managing diabetes. Assess her knowledge of the disease process and lifestylechanges needed. Ask her about symptoms of fatigue, polyuria, polyphagia,and polydipsia. Ask about previous pregnancy outcomes and the weightof infants. b. What education will she need to address this new diagnosis? Dietary modications to reduce the amount of simple sugarsand carbohydrates Thorough explanation of potential complications of tract Congenital anomalies: cardiac, CNS, and skeletal anomalies Literature describing diet, exercise, and glucose monitoring Outline of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia symptoms Referral to nutritionist for diet planning d. How will you evaluate the effectiveness of your interventions? Schedule more frequent prenatal visits to evaluate herhealth status. Evaluate glucose values at each visit to validate that theyare in the normal range. Monitor HbA1C to determine past glucose levels. 2. a. What is your first approach with the client to gain her trust? Open the conversation by asking questions about school activities and her friends. Remain nonjudgmental and bringthe discussion to general questions about her monthly cycles. Finally work toward questions about when she lasthad her period, and assess how many months pregnant sheis. Adolescents usually deny a pregnancy for several months,so she may be well into her second trimester. b. List the client's educational needs during this pregnancy. Signs and symptoms of preterm labor Nutritional needs during pregnancy Need for prenatal care throughout pregnancy Importance of early detection of complications Decision about whether to involve her partner Reasons for the frequency of prenatal visits and importance of keeping them Symptoms of sexually transmitted infections Impact of substance abuse on fetal growth and development Childbearing and parenting classes Infant growth and development and newborn careANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 797 c. What prevention strategies are needed to prevent a second pregnancy? Ask about her educational goals and encourage her to com-plete school; perhaps refer her for vocational counseling. Identify her personal strengths and reinforce positive self-esteem. Actively involve her in her care at each visit and praise herfor her efforts. Discuss family planning methods appropriate for her andlet her decide. Enhance a positive perception of her ability to succeed in life. 3. a. What aspects of this woman's history may lead thenurse to suspect that this infant is at risk for fetal alcoholspectrum disorder? Lack of prenatal care History of substance abuse (alcohol) during previouspregnancies Children placed in foster care from birth due to poormothering ability Appearance on arrival and evidence of being malnourished Statement about not having any \"recent\" use of alcohol Delivery of newborn weighing 4 lb b. What additional screening or laboratory tests might validate your suspicion? Screening questionnaires can be used to diagnose problem drinking, along with a drug screen (urine or blood) of bothher and the newborn to identify specic substances present. The social service agency can also be called to do a morethorough history on this woman. c. What physical and neurodevelopmental decits might present later in life if the infant has fetal alcohol spectrumdisorder? The infant might have attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor impulse control, learning disabilities, and commu-nication problems, as well as growth restriction/developmentalproblems. It is important to address this woman's alcohol de-pendence by offering care options such as addiction treatment, mental health therapy, and support. As a nurse, it is importantto be sensitive to the client's cultural, spiritual, religious, andemotional needs during this time. Discussion of effective con-traception while she is struggling with her addiction is impor-tant to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Study Activities 1.Responses will vary based on the woman's preexisting condition. Common themes might be changes inactivity level if the woman interviewed has one of the anemias or hypertension and dietary modications ifshe is diabetic; all might express concern about thepregnancy outcome.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 7972.This study activity is one that many college students can relate to. Confronting the friend who is in denialis the most effective way to bring the issue up. Back itup with observed behaviors that demonstrate thefriend's drug or alcohol dependency. Telling the per-son that you care about her and her well-being can goa long way toward modifying her behavior. 3.The answers will vary depending on which side the student takes. Some of the common themes mightcenter on civil rights and the positive aspects mari-juana has had on nausea and vomiting for cancer patients and controlling glaucoma pressure. On theother side of the debate, allowing this drug to belegalized might afford many pregnant women accessto it, without long-term research studies to documenteffects on offspring. 4.The nurse should present the facts that taking the medications will reduce the risk of transmission of HIV and should discuss how the woman and her newborn will benefit from them. Stressing theimportance of lowering her viral load throughouther pregnancy and relating it to her well-beingmight help. Presenting her with the facts is all thatthe nurse can do, since the final decision will be the woman's. 5.A, B, C, E, and F. Women with all the infections listed except HIV can choose to breastfeed. An HIV-positive woman can pass the virus to her newbornthrough breast milk and should be discouraged frombreastfeeding. CHAPTER 21 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is D: fetopelvic disproportion is dened as a condition in which the fetus is too largeto pass through the maternal pelvis. Cervical insuf-ciency would lead to an abortion, typically in the sec-ond trimester, when the heavy gravid uterus wouldcause pressure on the weakened cervix. A contractedpelvis might cause passageway problems, but if thefetus was small, no problem might occur. Maternaldisproportion doesn't indicate where the dispropor-tion is located. 2.The correct response is B: herpes exposure during the birth process poses a high risk for mortality to theneonate. If the woman has active herpetic lesions inthe genital tract, a surgical birth is planned to avoidthis exposure. Hepatitis is a chronic liver disorder,and the fetus if exposed would at most become a carrier; a surgical birth would not be expected for this woman. Toxoplasmosis is passed through theplacenta to the fetus prior to birth, so a cesarean birthwould not prevent exposure. HPV would be manifestclinically by genital warts on the woman, and a surgi-798 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS cal birth would not be anticipated to prevent exposure unless the warts caused an obstruction. 3.The correct response is A: having a fetus in a poste- rior position would cause intense back pain second-ary to the fetal head facing the maternal vertebraand causing pressure. Leg cramps are common dur-ing pregnancy and not caused by an occiput poste-rior position, but rather pressure from the heavygravid uterus toward term. Fetal position would not contribute to nausea and vomiting. Goingthrough transition in labor might cause nausea and vomiting, not the fetal position. A precipitousbirth occurs rapidly and is not associated with intense back pain. 4.The correct response is D. Women with a history of preterm birth are at the highest risk for the samein subsequent pregnancies. Having had twins pre-viously would have no bearing on this singletonpregnancy to influence preterm labor. Location of residence is not a risk for preterm labor. Thewoman's occupation as a computer programmerwould not increase her risk of preterm labor. How-ever, standing for long periods in a work environ-ment might increase her risk. 5.The correct response is D: prostaglandins soften and thin out the cervix in preparation for labor induction.Although they do irritate the uterus, they aren't aseffective as oxytocin in stimulating contractions.Prostaglandin gel would stimulate cervical nervereceptors rather than numb them. Prostaglandinshave no power to prevent cervical lacerations. 6.The correct response is C: hypotonic labor typically occurs in the active phase; it involves ineffectivecontractions to evoke cervical dilation and causessecondary inertia. Hypertonic labor is characterizedby painful, high-intensity contractions that usuallyoccur in the latent phase. A precipitous labor oc-curs within 3 hours and cervical dilation is very fastsecondary to effective, high-intensity contractions.Dysfunctional labor describes any pattern thatdoesn't produce dilation and effacement in a timely manner. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. Based on the nurse's ndings, what might you suspect isgoing on? Since Marsha is multiparous and is in the active phase of labor without progression and the contraction pattern hasbecome less intense, a hypotonic uterine dysfunction shouldbe suspected. b. How can the nurse address Marsha's anxiety? Give her, in an easily understood manner, facts about dys- functional labor. Outline expected treatment and outcome.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 798Encourage questions and expression of feelings. Identify how this dysfunctional labor pattern may alter her labor plan. Re-assure Marsha about the status of her fetus. Maintain a posi-tive attitude about her ability to cope with this situation. c. What are the appropriate interventions to change this labor pattern? Typically some form of labor augmentation is initiated to produce more effective contractions to facilitate cervicaldilatation\u2014rupture of membranes or use of IV oxytocin tostimulate the intensity of contractions. If neither one ofthese interventions changes the hypotonic pattern, a surgi-cal birth is in order. 2. a. What might be occurring? Based on Marsha's description, the nurse might suspect spontaneous rupture of membranes. b. How will the nurse conrm the suspicions? Depending on the agency protocol, the nurse may perform or assist with a sterile speculum examination to observe for evi-dence of fluid pooling in the posterior vagina, any dischargepresent, inflammation or lesions, or protrusion of the mem-branes through the cervix. The nurse should also documentthe amount, color, and consistency of any fluid found duringthe examination. c. What interventions are appropriate for this nding? Obtain a baseline set of vital signs to assess FHR patterns for changes possibly indicating a prolapsed umbilical cord. Use Nitrazine paper to test for the presence of amniotic fluid:it will turn blue in the presence of amniotic fluid because it isalkaline. Examine a sample of fluid from the vagina under the micro-scope for a fern pattern once it dries. Study Activities 1.This international website offers numerous educational and personal testimonies to assist parents who havesuffered a perinatal loss. There are listings of localsupport groups in which they can participate. 2.Maternal/fetal risks associated with a prolonged pregnancy include maternal exhaustion, psycholog-icaldepression, macrosomia, dysmaturity syndrome, fetal hypoxia, meconium aspiration syndrome, stillbirth. 3.dystocia CHAPTER 22 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is C: it is important to assess the situation before intervening. In addition, check-ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 799 ing the bladder status and emptying a full bladderwill correct uterine displacement so that effectivecontractions to stop bleeding can occur. Assessmentof the situation is needed before the nurse can notifythe health care provider. At this point, the nurse hasno facts to report about the client's condition. Mag-nesium sulfate would relax the uterus and increasebleeding. Pallor and heavy bleeding are not normalndings during the postpartum period. 2.The correct response is A: psychotic persons tend to lose touch with reality and frequently attempt toharm themselves or others. This behavior may occurwhen a woman experiences postpartum psychosis.Anxiety typically does not induce hallucinations orcause a person to want to harm herself or others.Depression involves feelings of sadness rather thanhallucinations or thoughts of harming herself orothers. Feeling \"down,\" but not to the extreme ofwanting to harm herself or her newborn, is suggestiveof postpartum blues. 3.The correct response is D: hemorrhage is possible if the uterus cannot contract and clamp down on the vessels to reduce bleeding. When the placenta isexpelled, open vessels are then exposed and the riskof hemorrhage is great. Thrombophlebitis typically ismanifested later in the postpartum period rather thanwithin the rst few hours after birth. Infection usuallyis manifested 24 to 48 hours after birth, not withinthe rst few hours. 4.The correct response is C: applying compresses and giving analgesics would be helpful in providing com-fort to the woman with painful breasts. Treatment formastitis encourages frequent breastfeeding to emptythe breasts. Lanolin applied to the breasts will havelittle impact on mastitis other than to keep themmoist. Binding both breasts will not bring relief; infact, it could cause additional discomfort. Emptyingthe breasts frequently through breastfeeding wouldbe helpful. Although wearing a nursing bra will helpsupport the heavy breasts and fresh air is helpful toprevent cracked nipples, these are ineffective oncemastitis develops. 5.The correct response is C. A boggy uterus that is mid- line and above the umbilicus suggest that the uterus isnot contracting properly. Therefore, the nurse shouldmassage the fundus to aid in stimulating the uterinemuscles to contract. In addition, the nurse should assess the client's lochia. Vital signs are taken oncefundal massage has been initiated. Monitoring uterineoutput is important to evaluate the woman's fluid bal-ance, but this would have no effect at all on alleviatingthe current situation. Since the uterus is midline, it isunlikely that a full bladder is the cause. Notifying thewoman's obstetrician would be necessary if fundalmassage did not alleviate the problem.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 7996.The correct response is D. Methergine can cause hypertension. Therefore, if the woman's blood pres- sure was already elevated, the nurse would need to question the order for the drug. Typically if methergineis ordered, her lochia flow would be increased, notminimal. Methergine is not used to treat mastitis,which would be evidenced by tender, inflamedbreasts. A pulse rate of 68 beats per minute is notan unusual finding and would not be a reason toquestion the order. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. What postpartum complication is this new mother athighest risk for? Why? Postpartum infection would be the highest risk for this client because of the risk factors present: anemia, prolonged rupturedmembranes, prolonged labor before a surgical birth with anincision, the likelihood of frequent vaginal examinationsduring the prolonged labor, and the use of internal fetalmonitoring devices. b. What assessments need to be done to detect this complication? Monitor the client for signs of early infection: fever, malaise, abdominal pain, foul-smelling lochia, boggy uterus, tachy- cardia, and anorexia. Test results would indicate an elevated white blood cell count and sedimentation rate. Assessmentof her incision for drainage and approximation of edgesshould be done frequently. c. What nursing measures will the nurse use to prevent this complication? Adhere to strict aseptic technique in providing nursing careto the incision. Instruct the client about self-care measures to help preventinfection such as handwashing, perineal hygiene, wipingfrom front to back, and hydration. Complete a thorough \"BUBBLE =HE\" assessment and record ndings. Urge the client to change her peripads frequently and usethe peri-bottle. Reinforce home care instructions to continue infectionprevention. 2. a. What factors place Tammy at risk for postpartum hemorrhage? Tammy is a grand multipara with nine previous pregnancies, and thus her uterus has been stretched repeatedly with closepregnancies. She also had an epidural during labor andtherefore has limited sensation to her bladder. b. What assessments are needed before planning interventions? If Tammy's fundus is boggy (uterine atony) and her bladder is full, intervention is needed to promote voiding. If the800 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS fundus is firm and her bladder is empty, additional evalua- tion is needed to rule out lacerations or retained placentalfragments as a causative factor contributing to her heavyvaginal bleeding. c. What nursing actions are needed to prevent a postpartum hemorrhage? After the assessment is completed and the uterus is found to be boggy and the bladder is full, the next step is to getthe client up to void. After Tammy empties her bladder, reassess the fundus for firmness and location. With a fullbladder, the uterus is typically displaced to the right of the midline. After emptying the bladder, the fundus shouldreturn to the midline and be firm. As a result, bleedingshould decrease. 3. a. What factors/behaviors place Lucy at risk for an affectivedisorder? Lucy had a previous episode of postpartum depression. Her be- havior indicates limited interest in her newborn and herself by not providing care. She reports she is disappointed in the sexof this child. Lucy's inactivity and lack of appetite are alsoproblematic since she will be going home and needs to carefor herself and her newborn. b. Which interventions might be appropriate at this time? In a sensitive, caring manner, the nurse should approach Lucy and ask her questions to get a complete picture of her emotionalstatus. Demonstrating concern and care might encourageLucy to express her feelings about her situation and the new-born. Using therapeutic communication through open-endedquestions might assist in gathering data. Notifying the healthcare provider of the ndings is also crucial. c. What education does the family need prior to discharge? The family needs information on postpartum emotional dis- orders and referrals to community counseling centers to assist Lucy through this time. Providing the family with theaddresses of websites that offer assistance and informationabout emotional disorders might also be helpful. A good social support network of family and friends will be neededto care for both Lucy and her newborn initially when she isdischarged. Study Activities 1.Postpartum blues are usually self-limiting and benign, occurring a few days after childbirth and endingwithin 2 weeks. The woman cries easily, is irritable,and is more emotionally labile than normal. Thisemotional disorder usually resolves without specifictreatment other than reassurance and support fromthe family. Postpartum depression occurs within 6 months after childbirth and is similar to other depressive disorders. The woman feels inadequate as11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 800a parent and has disturbances in appetite, mood, sleep, concentration, and energy. Psychotherapy andantidepressants are helpful to address this disorder,which may take months to resolve. Family patienceand support are very important for her. Postpartum psychosis may result in suicidal or homicidal behavior and requires immediate medical and psychiatric inter-vention. Clinical manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, or both within 3 weeks after giving birth.Inpatient psychiatric services may be needed for thissevere emotional disorder. 2.Students will offer varying opinions based on the website they select. 3.The information obtained from this interview will vary depending on the woman's experience. It ishoped that some of the comments about helpfulnesswill center on a nurse who was present and providedassistance to her. 4.uterine atony 5.Information the nurse needs to care for this mother and her newborn should include vital signs, fundalassessment (firm or boggy and location), lochiacharacteristics (color, amount, smell, consistency),appearance of perineum (episiotomy site, lacerations, swelling, bruising), breast status (wearing a soft, sup-portive bra; any nipple problems), and eliminationstatus (empty or not voiding). CHAPTER 23 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is C: a postterm infant is one born after the 42nd week of gestation. Birth between38 and 41 weeks is considered within a normal rangefor a term newborn. A gestation of 44 weeks wouldbe considered extremely long if the dates were calcu-lated correctly. 2.The correct response is A: the fetus's body, in an attempt to compensate for the low oxygen level,produces more red blood cells to carry the limitedamount of oxygen available. Thus, polycythemiawill be present at birth in a fetus experiencing hypoxia in utero. Hypoglycemia is typically causedby inadequate stores of glycogen and overuse while living in a hostile environment. Low serum calciumlevels are associated with perinatal asphyxia and notan increase in red blood cells. Hypothermia is associ-ated with a decrease in body fat, particularly brownfat stores, and is not linked to increased productionof red blood cells. 3.The correct response is B: subcutaneous and brown fat stores may be used by the stressed fetus to sur-vive in utero and thus will not be available to pro-vide extrauterine warmth. Excessive red blood cellbreakdown is responsible for hyperbilirubinemia,not the breakdown of brown fat stores. PolycythemiaANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 801 is caused by a buildup of red blood cells in responseto a hypoxic state in utero; it is not linked to loss of subcutaneous and brown fat stores. Glycogenstores are used for survival in an environment withdepleted glycogen and are unrelated to brown fat stores. 4.The correct answer is D. When a newborn is born too soon, fetal circulation may persist into extrauterinelife. The ductus arteriosis and foramen ovale may re-main open if pulmonary vascular resistance remainshigh and oxygen levels remain low. This would bemanifested by a heart murmur. 5.The correct response is C: the parents need to validate the experience of loss. The best way to do this is to encourage them to participate in theirnewborn's care so that the grieving process can takeplace. Avoiding the experience of loss inhibits thegrieving process. Avoidance prolongs the experi-ence of loss and does not allow the parents to venttheir feelings so that they can progress through theirgrief. It is not the nurse's responsibility, nor is ithealthy for the family, to take over decisions for afamily. Family members need to support each otherand need to decide what is best for their situation.Leaving the family alone can be viewed as abandon-ment; privacy is important, but leaving them totallyalone is not therapeutic. 6.The correct response is A, B and C. Minimal han- dling, maintaining a neutral thermal environment,and decreasing environmental stimuli are importantmeasures to conserve energy in newborns with vari-ations in birth weight and gestational age. Feedingand digestion will increase energy demands. Ther-mal warmers may produce hypothermia and thus in-crease energy demands. Preventing parents fromvisiting their newborn is not a plan to reduce energyexpenditure and could increase stress for both par-ents and newborn. 7.The correct response is C. Newborns feel pain and require the same level of pain assessment and painmanagement as adults. Pain assessment, which iscomprehensive, involves observations of changes in vital signs, behavior, facial expression, and bodymovement. It is considered the \"fifth vital sign\" andshould be checked as frequently as the other foursigns. All newborns experience pain, not just thoseundergoing surgical procedures. Preterm newbornshave an increased risk of pain because they are sub-jected to repeat procedures and exposed to noxiousstimuli. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. What might these behaviors indicate? These behaviors are clinical signs of hypoglycemia, which is common in a postterm infant after a difficult birth; glyco-11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 801gen stores are depleted secondary to chronic placental insufficiency. b. For what other conditions might this newborn be at high risk? Besides hypoglycemia, hypothermia, polycythemia, meconium aspiration, and hyperbilirubinemia are common in the post-term infant. c. What intervention is needed to address this newborn's condition? Feed the newborn as early as possible, or administer glucose/ glucagon to counter the low blood glucose level. Decreaseenergy requirements to conserve glucose and glycogen stores.Maintain a neutral thermal environment to prevent coldstress, which can exacerbate the hypoglycemia. 2. a. What might have contributed to this newborn's hypo-thermic condition? The simple fact that the newborn was premature predisposes him to thermal instability because of his larger surface-to-weight ratio, immature muscle tone and decreased muscularactivity to generate heat, diminished stores of subcutaneousand brown fat, and poor nutritional intake, which makes himunable to meet energy requirements for growth and develop-ment. In addition, placing the isolette close to the door mightproduce cold drafts, causing hypothermia. b. What transfer mechanism may have been a factor? This preterm newborn could experience loss of heat by convec- tion (heat transfer via air currents). c. What intervention would be appropriate for the nurse to initiate? Bundle or nest the preterm newborn with warmed blankets and move the isolette away from the door to prevent heat lossby convection. Place a knitted cap on the newborn's head andmonitor his temperature frequently. 3. a. What complication might this SGA newborn be manifesting? The signs indicate polycythemia, which is common in SGA infants. b. What factors may have contributed to this complication? In SGA infants, polycythemia is thought to be secondary to chronic hypoxia in utero, with resulting erythropoietinproduction. Complications of polycythemia are related tothe increased viscosity of blood, which interferes withorgan circulation. c. What would be an appropriate intervention to manage this condition?802 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS Obtain a venous hematocrit measurement within 4 to 6 hours after birth to validate this condition, since its manifesta-tions are very similar to those of hypoglycemia. Hematocrit values over 65% should be brought to the health care provider'sattention. Typically it is treated by a dilutional exchangetransfusion. Study Activities 1.Answers will vary depending on parents interviewed. 2.The March of Dimes web site is full of ideas on how to prevent preterm births, which include early prenatalcare for all women, diagnostic tests to detect changes in the cervix, and prevention of maternal infections.The students' comments may center on the inaccessi-bility of health care, which precludes some pregnantwomen from receiving early prenatal care, and thelack of insurance to cover the cost of diagnostic testsor prescriptions for treatment of infections. 3.hypoglycemia 4.clavicle fractures, facial palsies, and brachial plexus injuries. CHAPTER 24 Multiple Choice Questions 1.The correct response is D: nasal flaring is a cardinal sign of air hunger in respiratory distress syndrome.When an infant becomes hypoxic due to poor lungexpansion, the nares expand to \"search\" for moreoxygen to relieve the low oxygen concentration. Abdominal distention denotes air in the intestines,not hypoxia. Acrocyanosis is present only in the extremities and might indicate sluggish circulation.An infant with respiratory distress syndrome woulddemonstrate generalized cyanosis secondary to hypoxemia. Depressed fontanels would indicate dehydration, not respiratory distress syndrome. 2.The correct response is C: irritability is a prime symptom of drug withdrawal in newborns. As theyexperience physiologic withdrawal from the addictivesubstance, irritability with crying and the inabilityto be consoled are prevalent behaviors. Newbornsexposed to substances are anything but calm whenwithdrawing from an addictive substance. They are extremely distressed, and their faces commonlyexhibit that distress. Weight loss, not weight gain, is typical of the newborn exposed to substances. Although they show signs of hunger, vomiting iscommon and thus weight loss follows. These new-borns are extremely distressed and agitated. Theirfeeding and sleeping patterns are disrupted andwould not be described as normal.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 8023.The correct response is D: the newborn with this anomaly cannot handle oral secretions since theesophagus ends in a blind pouch. The secretionstypically foam out of the mouth, and this becomes aclue that a stula exists. A tracheoesophageal stulaalone doesn't affect the newborn's temperature unless an infection is present. This defect is struc-tural, not neurologic. The newborn's ability to swal-low is not related to this structural defect. Therewould have to be an insult to the CNS for swallowingto be affected as well as a structural defect in thepharynx. 4.The correct response is A. Transient tachypnea is commonly seen in newborns who have been born by cesarean birth. Passage through the birth canalduring a vaginal birth compresses the thorax, help-ing remove the fluid from the fetus' lungs. Thismechanism is lost with a cesarean birth. Sedation is also implicated as a contributing factor to the devel-opment of transient tachypnea. Prolonged labor,macrosmia of the fetus, and maternal asthma andsmoking have also been associated with a higher incidence of this condition. Maternal heart diseaseand small for gestational age status are not associatedwith transient tachypnea. 5.The correct response is C. Instructions for the parents of a child with a cleft lip and palate should includeburping the infant frequently during feedings to reducethe risk of aspiration and vomiting; feeding the infantin an upright position to prevent aspiration; limitingfeeding sessions to avoid overfatigue; and using high-calorie formulas to improve caloric intake. 6.The correct response is D. An infant with develop- mental hip dysplasia would demonstrate an audibleclunk when abducting the hip. Other ndings wouldinclude asymmetric thigh folds, unequal knee height,and limited abduction of the hip. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. a. What in the mother's history should raise a red flag tothe nurse? Prolonged rupture of the membranes provides an avenue for bacteria to ascend into the mother's genital tract. The factthat she had a fever during labor is a key sign. b. What condition is this newborn at high risk for? Neonatal sepsis would be a likely diagnosis based on the mother's history and the nonspecific clinical manifestationsin the newborn. c. What interventions are appropriate for this condition? The nurse should document the assessment ndings and report them to the pediatrician so that cultures and blood work canANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS 803 be started to identify the offending organism. General antibiotictherapy is typically started until the offending organism isidentified. 2. a. What additional information do you need to obtain fromthe mother? It is important to understand the extent and type of her drug use during pregnancy. Ask specific questions about herdrug use so that you can plan care for her as well as hernewborn. Place her at ease and ask direct, nonjudgmentalquestions. b. What additional laboratory work might be needed for Terry? Due to an increased risk of HIV in injection drug users, an HIV test along with a polydrug screen is needed. The mother'sconsent must be obtained prior to the HIV testing. c. What specic measures need to be made for her ongoing care? After extensive counseling regarding the perinatal risks due to her heroin use, referral to a drug detoxication center andpossibly methadone maintenance may be necessary. Depend-ing on her commitment to stop taking drugs to reduce harmto her newborn, additional social services need to be explored.Although the decision to change her lifestyle is her choice,the nurse can play a vital role in guiding the care to achievea better outcome for the mother and her infant. Terry alsowill need to undergo detoxification and will require closesupervision until withdrawal has been achieved. Tight wrapping,calming techniques, and reduced stimuli will help decreasethe newborn's irritability. 3. a. What additional assessments should you complete? A spectrum of anomalies are possible, including the GI, GU, and cardiac systems. All of the systems require careful assessmentfor any additional disorders. b. Are anorectal agenesis and genitourinary tract anomalies common? Yes, genitourinary defects are the most common ones associated with anorectal agenesis since both systems share a commonorigin and developmental period. c. What diagnostic tests might be ordered? What might be included in the treatment plan for this newborn? Depending on additional anomalies found, an abdominal ultra- sound, cardiac echography, and skeletal x-rays are needed torule out associated defects. Depending on the extent of theanomalies found, surgical intervention might be in order tocorrect the structural defects.11223-26_Answers_rev.qxd 8/4/08 3:08 PM Page 803Study Activities 1.This answer will vary depending on each student's perceptions, but common impressions of the role of NICU nurses would be their autonomy and thenumerous types of technical equipment needed for each newborn. The students will probably note thatthe new parents seem overwhelmed because of the804 ANSWERS TO WORKSHEET QUESTIONS amount of equipment being used. Pointing out to expectant parents how capable and competent thenurses are will help in reducing their anxiety. 2.The students will nd thorough descriptions of the specic congenital condition aimed at the level oflaypeople.

however, the woman should always check with the pe-diatrician, physician, or lactation specialist before tak-ing any medications, including over-the-counter andherbal products. Inform the woman that she has the right to seek a sec- ond opinion if the physician does not perform athoughtful risk-versus-benet assessment before pre-scribing medications or advising against breast-feeding. Most medications pass from the woman's bloodstream into the breast milk. However, the amount is usuallyvery small and unlikely to harm the baby. A preterm or other special needs neonate is more susceptible to the adverse effects of medications inbreast milk. A woman who is taking medications andwhose baby is in the neonatal intensive care unit orspecial care nursery should consult with the pediatri-cian or neonatologist before feeding her breast milkto the baby. If the woman is taking a prescribed medication, she should take the medication just after breast-feeding.This practice helps ensure that the lowest possible doseof medication reaches the baby through the breast milk. Some medications can cause changes in the amount of milk the woman produces. Teach the woman to reportany changes in milk production.

(LRC: L2) Trace-to-negligible amounts of are Non-narcotic Analgesics NSAIDs (LRC: L1) Naproxen may cause neonatal hemorrhage and anemia if used for prolonged periods. (LRC: L3 for short-termuse and L4 for long-term use) The newer COX2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib (Celebrex), appear to be safe for use. (LRC: L2) Antibiotics Levels in breast milk are usually very low. The penicillins and cephalosporins are generally considered safe to use. (LRC: L1 and L2) Tetracyclines can be safely used for short periods but are not suitable for long-term therapy (e.g., for treat-ment of acne). (LRC: L2) Sulfonamides should not be used during the neonatal stage (the rst month of life). (LRC: L3) Antihypertensives A high degree of caution is advised when anti- hyper tensives are used during breast-feeding. Some beta blockers can be used. Hydralazine and methyldopa are considered to be safe. (LRC: L2)APPENDIX E BREAST-FEEDING AND MEDICATION USE819 ACE inhibitors are not recommended in the early postpartum period. Sedatives and Hypnotics Neonatal withdrawal can occur when antianxiety med- ications, such as lorazepam, are taken. Fortunatelywithdrawal is generally mild. Phenothiazines, such as Phenergan and Thorazine, may lead to sleep apnea and increase the risk for sud-den infant death syndrome. Antidepressants The risk to the baby often is higher if the woman is depressed and remains untreated, rather than takingthe medication. The older tricyclics are considered to be safe; however they cause many bothersome side effects, such asweight gain and dry mouth, which may lead to non-compliance on the part of the woman. The selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) also are considered to be safe and have a lower side effectprole, which makes them more palatable to thewoman. (LRC: L2 and L3) Mood Stabilizers (Antimanic Medication) Lithium is found in breast milk and is best not used in the breast-feeding woman. (LRC: L4) Valproic acid (Depakote) seems to be a more appro- priate choice for the woman with bipolar disorder.The infant will need periodic lab studies to checkplatelets and liver function. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids do not pass into the milk in large quantities. Inhaled steroids are safe to use because they don't accumulate in the bloodstream. Thyroid Medication Thyroid medications, such as levothyroxine (Synthroid), can be taken while breast-feeding. Most are in LRC category L1.
