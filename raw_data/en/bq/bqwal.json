A chiropractic is a licensed health care profession that utilizes the body's natural ability to heal itself. It's a system of therapy focused on the structure of the body, most commonly the spine. Commonly referred to as an \"adjustment\", chiropractic manipulation is performed to improve lost range of motion, increase segmental joint mobility, stimulate joint position sensors and promote normal function of the central nervous system. Our trained professionals manipulate the body's musculoskeletal system which naturally assists in both relieving pain and / or improving functionality. Our treatments range from postural and exercise education, stretching, sustained pressure to specific joint manipulations and ergonomic training. A chiropractor and patient relationship normally begins with a consultation (ours are free!) where our certified professionals can learn about your past and present health history, perform or schedule any tests that may be required, and do a brief examination of your body and skeletal system. As stated by the American Chiropractic Association in their [Frequently Asked Questions About Chiropractic](https://www.acatoday.org/News-Publications/Newsroom/Chiropractic-Frequently-Asked-Questions) article, chiropractic care is \"widely recognized as one of the safest drug-free, non-invasive therapies available for the treatment of neuromusculoskeletal complaints. Although chiropractic has an excellent safety record, no health treatment is completely free of potential adverse effects. The risks associated with chiropractic, however, are very small. Many patients feel immediate relief following chiropractic treatment, but some may experience mild soreness, stiffness or aching, just as they do after some forms of exercise. Current research shows that minor discomfort or soreness following spinal manipulation typically fades within 24 hours.\" Are you suffering from musculoskeletal related pains?
