Too often we accept that whatever winter sickness is 'going around' is an undesirable yet inevitable part of the season. This year, before you whip out the hand sanitizer, tissues and quarantine yourself for the foreseeable future, consider investing in your health with one of Clean Market's Immune Boosting IV Drips. WHY IV Drips for Immunity: Unlike our daily vitamins and supplements, which we typically ingest orally and which have only a roughly 20-30% absorption rate, IV drips are 100% bioavailable. This total bioavailability means that the active ingredients in an IV drip completely bypass our gut to deliver the vitamins and minerals that we need directly into our bloodstream. Our bodies can then soak up all the necessary vitamins and expel the excess, which is especially important when combatting a lingering virus. When to get an IV Drip: At Clean Market, we drip in sickness and in health. An immune-boosting IV drip can act as your protective armor, making you less susceptible to catching an airborne virus. In the event that you do come down with something, opting for an IV drip will be your first line of defense in fighting off the invader and cutting down on recovery time. Over-the-counter medications may help you temporarily reduce cold and flu symptoms, but they won't do anything to shorten the actual duration of your illness. Active Ingredients: when it comes to our immunity, there are a few key vitamins and minerals that are proven to boost and sustain our systems. Each of CM's immune boosting drips is custom formulated to include all the vital elements needed for our bodies to thrive. Read on to learn more about our top immune-boosting drips, and discover which is best for you. NutriMMUNITY: supercharge your immune defenses Megadose Vitamin C (the king of immunity boosting) is accompanied by zinc, calcium, magnesium, selenium and the B family to help fight off existing viruses, inflammation, infection and re-boost a depleted immune system or bolster the body pre-travel. NutriC: combat oncoming sickness Build your body up with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power before you even begin to worry about getting sick. A powerful punch of Vitamin C, B-Complex, Magnesium and Calcium will not only prevent viruses, autoimmune diseases and chronic illness but will also support the collagen production for skin health. NutriCLEANSE: detox and replenish In addition to the immune-boosting properties contained in the NutriCLEANSE drip (Vitamin C, B12, B-Complex, Selenium, etc.), the added Glutathione works to combat harmful toxins from urban exposure and to balance fatigue, poor diet and low energy for overall glow and vitality. How it works: if you're new to IV drips, know that you are in good hands. Each IV drip is administered by one of Clean Market's board certified nurses in the comfort of our drip lounge. Over the course of 30 to 90 minutes, the IV will drip into your system, infusing your body with a powerful jolt of nutrients to revive you to peak performance. Our staff will ensure that you experience peak comfort and confidence throughout your experience. Beverages from the [Clean Market functional cafe and tonic bar](https://cleanmarket.com/pages/menu-tonic-bar) can be purchased before your drip to enhance the experience. Show up for your health and let us take care of the rest. "}
