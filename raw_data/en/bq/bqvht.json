Naturopathic doctors (N.D.'s) treat acute and chronic ailments holistically, addressing and removing the root cause of dis-ease. N.D's provide preventative care, while teaching their patients to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes and natural therapies to promote optimal health and prevent illness. The role of the naturopathic physician is to educate and encourage individuals to take responsibility for their own care, while providing the body with the tools to heal. Naturopathic doctors are trained in the basic medical sciences and conventional diagnostics. In addition, naturopathic education includes therapeutic nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, natural childbirth, traditional Chinese medicine, hydrotherapy, naturopathic manipulative therapy, pharmacology and minor surgery. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: - The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. - Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. - First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: - Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; - Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and - Acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process. - - Doctor as Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize the importance of the doctor-patient relationship. - Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. - Prevention: Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. \"Let Food "}
