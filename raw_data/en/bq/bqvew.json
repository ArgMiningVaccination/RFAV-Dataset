I have never seen the entire world so gripped by fear and uncertainty. Everyone and I do mean everyone is weighing in on what this means, why it is happening, and how long it will last. I don't know all the answers, but there are some things we can know for sure. As Children of God we have access to a peace that passes understanding - that is, it is not natural or carnal. It is supernatural, surpassing what the mind and intellect can comprehend. That is important because what we need right now is not more information - we are being bombarded with news. What we need is something that goes straight into the core of our being and fortifies us from within. That is what the Word of God does. Over the next few days, we want to bombard your heart and mind with timeless, unchangeable truth from God's Word that will act as a spiritual vaccine, inoculating you against fear, anxiety, and worry. These words were true before COVID-19 came along and they will be true long after it is gone. But in moments like these, we need to remind ourselves of these truths more than ever before. Some people begin to waver in times like these. Like the disciples in the storm from yesterday's message, we can question God, His Word, His love, and His faithfulness. But this is the time we need to cling to Him as never before. I love this quote from Reinhard Bonnke \" If you are struggling, grab a hold of God's Word and His truth with all your might - it is your lifeline! In John 10:10, Jesus made a clear contrast between His mission and the devil's mission. Satan's plans for us are in complete opposition to God's plans for us! It is paramount we believe this foundational truth: Jesus came that we may have life and have it abundantly! We see the declarations of His love for mankind all over the scriptures, both in His words and in His actions\u2014 and most profoundly, when He laid down His life for us on the cross. Jesus loves us! He is for us! He gave us His word as our solid rock to stand on so that when the thief comes to attack, we can stand in unwavering trust in God's faithful promises. Once Satan has convinced a person to misplace their trust in the Lord, then they become susceptible to the contagions of fear, doubt, and unbelief. When a person is exposed to a pathogen and they survive, their bodies learn how to fight that contagion and they become immune to it from then on. This is where we get the old clich\u00e9 \"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\" I believe it is very similar to our spirits. As we go through life, overcoming trials and difficulties, emerging victorious, we become stronger, spiritually tougher and more resilient in faith. That is why a season like the one we are in now is so important. It can be a training ground for the more significant battles to come in the future. God has a purpose in the storm. "}
