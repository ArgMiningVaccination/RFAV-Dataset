From cell motility to cell-cell interactions, protein trafficking to cytoskeleton dynamics, cell cycle or cell death/apoptosis or many other topics in cell biology, live cell imaging may be critical to your research. In addition to balancing your needs for sensitivity, resolution and fluorophore requirements, you now have the added challenges of protecting your samples from phototoxicity with gentle imaging while balancing your need to acquire images at a faster speed. Perhaps you need options for photomanipulation. Your experiments may also require increased throughput, which can be very challenging with live samples. - Fast and Sensitive Widefield Imaging One of the most sensitive and fast solutions for live cell imaging is with widefield microscopes, such as the ZEISS Axio Observer inverted microscope. The entire field is imaged quickly using a high-speed camera. 3D data can be enhanced with deconvolution. Study the dynamics of multiple fluorophores quickly and with high resolution. The systems can be economical, straightforward and easy to use. - Extremely Gentle, Long-Term Volumetric Imaging With Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy volumetric imaging of subcellular structures and dynamics over hours to days with the best protection from photo damage. The system is both extremely fast and remarkably gentle to living samples. Lattice Lightsheet 7 is built with integrated environmental controls to create the perfect setting for your samples. - Revolutionary Confocal Imaging with Superresolution Increased Speed and Flexibility in Fluorophore Choice The revolutionary design of the ZEISS LSM 9 family of confocal microscopes offer high sensitivity for crisp imaging and spectral flexibility for use of multiple fluorophores with overlapping excitation and emission spectra is possible with capabilities into the NIR as well as LSM Plus for improved resolution of spectral data. Airyscan 2 can be added for super-resolution capabilities with Multiplex mode for higher speed to capture cellular dynamics. Confocal microscopy is equipped for photomanipulation experiments such as photobleaching experiments (FRAP, FLIP, etc.), photoconversion and optogenetics. Molecular analyses such as FCS, RICS and FLIM are also available options. - Live Cell Imaging with Unprecedented Superresolution ZEISS Elyra 7 enables you to combine super-resolution and high-dynamic imaging. With resolution down to 60 nm and speeds up to 255 fps, you can examine the dynamics of sub-cellular organelles with up to two fluorophores. - Fully Automated Live Cell Imaging For high content, fully automated experiments, ZEISS Celldiscoverer 7 calibrates itself, detects and focuses on your samples with automatic optics adjustments. Fully integrated environmental controls create the perfect conditions for your samples for the duration of your experiment. Celldiscoverer 7 easily combined with confocal microscope, giving you access to enhanced 3D resolution, high speed super-resolution imaging, photomanipulation and more. Acquire more data for robust analyses with this reliable, automated live cell imaging platform. Contact ZEISS Microscopy - 1 * The images shown on this page represent research content.
