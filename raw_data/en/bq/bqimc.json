Introduction [1](#B1-medicina-55-00501)]. The cornerstone of treatment for food allergy is the strict avoidance of food allergens and the use of dietary substitutions. Food allergy reactions can range from mild skin rashes to severe, potentially lethal, anaphylaxis [ [2](#B2-medicina-55-00501)]. In order to prevent such reactions, individualized advice and education on how to manage an elimination diet should be provided for parents [ [3](#B3-medicina-55-00501)]. Hidden food allergens in medications can lead to unpredictable allergic reactions. Food-derived substances are used to protect, support, or enhance stability or for bioavailability or for patient acceptability during the manufacturing process of medications [ [4](#B4-medicina-55-00501)]. The aim of this review is to provide existing data about egg, red meat, gelatin, and fish allergens in medications. 2. Methodology 3. Hen's Egg 3.1. Vaccines [5](#B5-medicina-55-00501)]. [6](#B6-medicina-55-00501)]. Both inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine can be safely administered to children with egg allergy in the usual manner. The children should then be kept under medical surveillance for 30 min. Children with a previous history of immediate allergic reactions to egg that do not involve only skin (anaphylaxis) should receive the influenza vaccine under the supervision of personnel who are experts in recognizing and treating allergic reactions [ [7](#B7-medicina-55-00501)]. Yellow fever vaccine contains egg protein and children with egg allergy should receive a skin prick test to the vaccine with progressive dilution (1:10 and 1:1) and an intradermal test with a 1:100 dilution. If the test result is negative, vaccination can be given with a 60-min observation following the injection. If the skin test result is positive, the vaccine can be given in graded doses in a hospital [ [8](#B8-medicina-55-00501)]. 3.2. Propofol [9](#B9-medicina-55-00501)]. Sommerfield found that two of 304 children with egg, peanut, soybean, or legume allergy experienced a possible allergic reaction to propofol that may be due to egg sensitization in children sensitized to both egg yolk and egg white. On the other hand, 124 (14%) of 892 nonallergic children met the criteria for a possible allergic reaction to propofol [ [10](#B10-medicina-55-00501)]. Use of propofol in children with eosinophlic esophagitis was evaluated in 1365 upper intestinal tract endoscopy procedures by Mehta [ [8](#B8-medicina-55-00501)]. They found no differences in the rate of allergic reactions between food-allergic and nonallergic patients. Along this line, Wiskin found no reaction to propofol in 131 children with food allergy [ [11](#B11-medicina-55-00501)] and similar findings have been reported by Asserhoj in adults [ [12](#B12-medicina-55-00501)]. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey found that propofol was given to children with egg allergy in 6 out of 26 Spanish hospitals, with no adverse reaction [ [13](#B13-medicina-55-00501)]. Overall, there is no clear evidence that allergy to egg, peanut, soybean, or legumes is a risk factor for propofol reactions and there is no definite relationship between egg allergy and severe allergic reactions to propofol. Isopropyl side chain and phenyl groups are potential allergenic epitopes of propofol. In an adult study, none of the patients allergic to propofol had food allergies. Reactions to propofol were likely due to these components. Physicians may consider prudentially avoiding propofol in patients with a history of egg anaphylaxis. Accordingly, the Childhood Allergy Committee of the Spanish Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommended an alternate drug or test dose in children with a history of anaphylaxis to egg, while patients with mild egg allergy can safely receive propofol [ [13](#B13-medicina-55-00501)]. Propofol should be administered to egg-allergic patients by trained personnel who can recognize and treat anaphylaxis [ [12](#B12-medicina-55-00501)]. 4. Red Meat [14](#B14-medicina-55-00501)]. These antibodies were also responsible for allergy to red meat (beef, pork, or lamb) presenting as urticaria, wheezing, or anaphylaxis 3-6 h after ingestion of a mammalian meat meal. Gelatin and dairy products also contain alpha-gal. Skin prick tests with commercial meat extracts are often inconclusive. If there is a high level of suspicion, additional testing with a prick test to gelatin, prick-by-prick test with pork kidney, [ [15](#B15-medicina-55-00501)] and specific IgE to alpha-gal should be carried out [15](#B15-medicina-55-00501), [16](#B16-medicina-55-00501)]. 4.1. Cetuximab [18](#B18-medicina-55-00501)]. 4.2. Antivenoms [19](#B19-medicina-55-00501)]. 4.3. Prosthetic Heart Valves [20](#B20-medicina-55-00501)]. A relationship between IgE antibodies to -gal and a premature degeneration of bioprosthetic aortic valves has been suggested in two patients who developed an allergy to -gal. 4.4. Recombinant Human Proteins [21](#B21-medicina-55-00501)]. 4.5. Heparin [22](#B22-medicina-55-00501)]. 4.6. Gelatin [23](#B23-medicina-55-00501)]. Commercial in vitro assays for gelatin IgE showed negative results in these patients. Additional skin prick or intradermal tests should be performed with gelatin in colloids for appropriate diagnosis. A relationship between red meat, alpha-gal, and gelatin hypersensitivity has not yet been fully understood [ [24](#B24-medicina-55-00501)]. Zoster vaccine that contains gelatin may not be tolerated in some patients with allergy to alpha-gal [ [25](#B25-medicina-55-00501), [26](#B26-medicina-55-00501)]. 5. Gelatin 5.1. Vaccines [4](#B4-medicina-55-00501), [27](#B27-medicina-55-00501)]. The highest amounts are found in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), rabies, varicella-zoster, oral typhoid fever, and yellow fever vaccines, and lesser amounts (up to 2000 g/dose) in diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and influenza vaccines. Severe allergic reactions caused by gelatin have been described for MMR [ [27](#B27-medicina-55-00501), [28](#B28-medicina-55-00501)], varicella [ [ [32](#B32-medicina-55-00501)], and Japanese encephalitis vaccines. In the past, Japanese studies reported a high rate of positive gelatin specific IgE (86-100%) in patients with anaphylactic reactions to MMR and varicella vaccines. In contrast, U.S. and European studies revealed a lower rate of positive specific IgE (14-28%) in the same patients [ [27](#B27-medicina-55-00501), [33](#B33-medicina-55-00501)]. The inconsistency between results could be attributed to different types of gelatins used in the vaccines. In the 1990s, highly hydrolyzed porcine gelatin with low molecular weight was added as a stabilizer in MMR vaccines in the United States. However, partially hydrolyzed bovine gelatin with a small amount of high molecular weight was used in Japan in those years. A second explanation for the high incidence of gelatin allergy in Japan could be the existence of a genetic predisposition [ [5](#B5-medicina-55-00501)]. HLA type (DR 9) is common in Japanese patients [ [34](#B34-medicina-55-00501)]. Hydrolyzed gelatin was eliminated from the DTP vaccine in 1999. After gelatin was removed from the vaccines or converted to less allergenic highly hydrolyzed porcine gelatin, vaccine-induced anaphylaxis markedly decreased in Japan [ [5](#B5-medicina-55-00501)]. Children with red meat (bovine, pork, lamb) or milk allergy are at an increased risk of vaccine reactions due to gelatin [ [35](#B35-medicina-55-00501)]. These patients have positive specific IgE levels for bovine, lamb, pork, and milk. As we discussed previously, these patients may have detectable IgE to -gal [ [36](#B36-medicina-55-00501)]. All children with a previous reaction to foods or vaccines containing gelatin should undergo an allergy workup. Determination of IgE to gelatin is available for diagnosis but there is no standardized skin prick extract for gelatin. A skin prick test could be an option with a prick-by-prick method melting 1 teaspoon of sugared gelatin powder in 5 mL of saline solution. If a skin test is negative but there is a history of positive gelatin allergy, an oral provocation test with gelatin should be performed. If the oral provocation test is negative, the patient should be observed for 60 min after the vaccination. If the test is positive, a gelatin-free vaccine should be administered. If that is not possible, the vaccine should be given with a graded-dose protocol [ [5](#B5-medicina-55-00501)]. If the patient is immune, an additional dose is not required but protective IgG antibody levels should be periodically confirmed [ [37](#B37-medicina-55-00501)]. 5.2. Gelatin-Based Colloids [38](#B38-medicina-55-00501)]. Gelatin-based solutions are heterogeneous mixtures of polypeptides, usually produced by hydrolysis of bovine collagen, including large amounts of proline and hydroxyproline residues [ [39](#B39-medicina-55-00501)]. Albumin solution is derived from donated blood by fractionation and/or plasmapheresis. The processing is expensive [ [40](#B40-medicina-55-00501)]. Hence, gelatin- (1.7% of all fluid administrations) and starch-based (0.2%) solutions are more widely used than albumin (0.1%) [ [41](#B41-medicina-55-00501)]. The incidence of anaphylaxis to gelatin solutions is 6.2 per 100,000 doses and anaphylaxis occurs within 10 min after administration [ [42](#B42-medicina-55-00501)]. However, in 11 out of 12 adult patients with anaphylaxis to intravenous gelatin-based solutions, only three patients showed immediate reactions, within 5 min, after the administration of a solution, while most of the reactions occurred 10-70 min later [ [43](#B43-medicina-55-00501)]. All of them suffered from severe allergic reactions and three of them developed cardiac arrest. Skin prick tests and intradermal tests (when the SPT was negative or indeterminate) confirmed allergy in 11 patients and an intravenous provocation test was positive in one patient with a negative skin test. Evidence supporting the use of gelatin-based colloids for intraoperative hypotension is lacking and the risk of life-threatening allergic reactions to gelatin solutions is higher in comparison with other plasma expanders, so their use should be reconsidered [ [43](#B43-medicina-55-00501)]. 5.3. Other Drugs [44](#B44-medicina-55-00501)]. 5.4. Erythropoietin [45](#B45-medicina-55-00501)]. [46](#B46-medicina-55-00501), [47](#B47-medicina-55-00501), [48](#B48-medicina-55-00501), [49](#B49-medicina-55-00501)]. Even in patients who could tolerate gelatin-containing food and vaccines, a severe allergic reaction can develop due to the different route of administration [ [49](#B49-medicina-55-00501)]. 6. Fish [50](#B50-medicina-55-00501)]. These protamine-related adverse reactions attributed to fish allergy are due to a possible cross reactivity between fish and protamine. However, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. Inhibition of IgE binding to salmon with protamine sulphate or the presence of serum IgE to protamine in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have not been shown [ [51](#B51-medicina-55-00501)]. Levy et al. determined that fish allergy is not a risk factor for protamine reactions [ [52](#B52-medicina-55-00501)]. Protamine reactions in patients using insulin have been reported. Recently, three cases of protamine allergy were evaluated and two of them subsequently received insulin without any reaction. Other mechanisms, rather than allergy, may lead to these reactions [ [53](#B53-medicina-55-00501)]. 7. Cow's Milk 7.1. Corticosteroids [55](#B55-medicina-55-00501)]. However, patients allergic to milk usually tolerate lactose in DPI [ [44](#B44-medicina-55-00501)]. Therefore, it is suggested to be aware when such drugs are given to children with CMA. [56](#B56-medicina-55-00501), [57](#B57-medicina-55-00501), [58](#B58-medicina-55-00501), [59](#B59-medicina-55-00501)]. Noteworthy, skin tests were positive to methylprednisolone sodium succinate 40 mg injection and negative to lactose-free methylprednisolone formulation [ [56](#B56-medicina-55-00501), [57](#B57-medicina-55-00501), has contraindicated intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate 40 mg in children with CMA or suspected CMA [ [60](#B60-medicina-55-00501)]. 7.2. Vaccines [61](#B61-medicina-55-00501)], potentially elicited by caseins in culture media [ [62](#B62-medicina-55-00501)]. The oral polio vaccine may contain alpha-lactalbumin and its administration may trigger hypersensitivity reactions in children allergic to milk [ [63](#B63-medicina-55-00501)]. However, these findings have not been confirmed by adverse events recorded in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database [ [62](#B62-medicina-55-00501)]. However, children with CMA should be cautiously kept under surveillance for 1 h after they receive the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine or oral polio vaccine. 8. Other Drugs [64](#B64-medicina-55-00501)]. Although adverse reactions to probiotics are sparsely reported, anaphylaxis has been described in a patient with CMA [ [65](#B65-medicina-55-00501), [66](#B66-medicina-55-00501)]. Lactulose is made from lactose and it may be contaminated by milk proteins. A case report described the onset of a dry cough and wheezing associated with ingestion of lactulose syrup for the treatment of constipation in a 4-year-old child with severe CMA. An oral challenge was performed. After a total of 2 mL of lactulose, the child presented with oral itching, diffuse erythema with conjunctival hyperemia, sneezing, and coughing followed by wheezing [ [67](#B67-medicina-55-00501)]. 9.
