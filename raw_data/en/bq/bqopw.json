Whether through a literature review or a refractoryheadache patient asking for additional options,we are often reminded of the need for improvedheadache management. In many cases, the lack of satisfaction does not stem from a missing treatment,but rather the need for a global perspective on theindividual burden of headache, which can point to themost appropriate treatment approach. This perspective,known as the integrative approach, underscores theimportance of proper diagnosis, education, andreassurance, as well as appropriate and individualizedpharmacologic and interventional care. In addition,incorporating self-management skills and evidence-basedintegrative and behavioral approaches round outtreatment offerings to optimize care. Overall, thisapproach can be a transformative experience for thepatient and the clinician. Headache Burden and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Use Those suffering from headaches deal with extensive sequelae from the primary diagnosis as well as from comorbidities that create a significant personal, social, and societal burden. Migraine has been declared one of the top 10 disabling medical conditions, with sufferers experiencing more pain and restrictions in their daily activities than people diagnosed with osteoarthritis, diabetes, and depression (1,2). In addition, those dealing with migraine are more likely to be diagnosed with mood, sleep, movement, and pain disorders, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, fibromyalgia, and myofascial pain syndrome (3-7). One comorbidity that may be overlooked is myofascial pain syndrome, which is often diagnosed withcharacteristic trigger points (T rPs). Active T rPs in the upper trapezius, sternoclidomastoid, and temporalismuscles are associated with chronic tension type headache(CTTH) as well as with greater headache intensity andduration (8). In another study, T rPs were noted in 93.9%of migraineurs versus 29% of controls (p<0.0001) withthe number of T rPs being significantly associated with theduration and frequency of migraine attacks (9). Otherstudies in both CTTH and migraine populations havenoted pressure pain sensitivity of the trapezius, temporal,and suboccipital muscles as well as their association withdevelopment of peripheral sensitization/hyperalgesia (10). Based on the lack of satisfaction, large number of comorbidities, and the effect on quality of life (QOL), itis not surprising that the most common reason (47.7%)for attempted use of CAM among headache sufferers was\"potentially beneficial for headache.\" A similar percentage(30% to 40%) found the therapies helpful. Unfortunately,these therapies are often isolated from conventional careor even each other, with 60% of CAM users notinforming their medical doctors of CAM use (11). The Integrative Team and Patient Flow An integrative team best addresses the divergent needs ofthe headache patient. In the case of the Scripps Clinic, anintegrative approach requires the neurological expertise ofthe Donald J. Dalessio Headache Center; physicaltherapists trained in postural, manual, and craniosacraltherapy; and the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicinewith its team integrative physicians, nurse practitioners,nurses, acupuncturists, dieticians, pharmacists,psychologists, and biofeedback therapists (Figure 1). The initial neurological evaluation includes diagnosis, discussion, and reassurance, with the incorporation ofmedical, interventional, and preventive approaches. Focusis placed on early incorporation of preventive andabortive treatments to avoid progression of headache into 42 |THE PAIN PRACTITIONER | SPRING 2010DEPARTMENT |HEADACHE |INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES TO HEADACHE MANAGEMENT Integrative Approaches to Headache Management BY ROBERT BONAKDAR, MD, FAAFP, and CHRISTY JACKSON, MDTHE PAIN PRACTITIONER | VOLUME 20, NUMBER 1 | 43a chronic daily phenomenon. Often a discussion of common triggers is important to help individualize self-management, pharmacologic, and nonpharmacologictherapies. Subsequently, the patient undergoes an integrative medicine consultation that continues the discussion oftrigger management, and develops an integrative planusing in-house therapies, such as acupuncture,biofeedback, hypnosis, healing touch, diet and dietarysupplement counseling, and yoga, to provide anindividualized menu of treatment options (Figure 2). When outside services, such as chiropractic manipulation or additional psychobehavioral services, aredeemed medically appropriate, referrals are made tospecific practitioners in the community. The patient isfollowed by the neurology and integrative medicinespecialists at both centers on a regular basis to determinethe benefit of current therapies as well as the need for theintroduction or tapering of therapies. At all stages, theclinician not only attempts to integrate appropriatetherapies with patients, but also strives to integratepatients with their treatment plan. By incorporatingpatient preferences, motivations, and individual needsthroughout the treatment process, the greatest likelihoodof understanding, compliance, and self-empowerment are obtained. Pharmacologic and Interventional Options In addition to improving QOL, early evaluation andmedical treatment is important for several reasons.Appropriate preventative and abortive medication use canhelp avoid central sensitization, avoid medication overuse headache, and help retain the efficacy ofprophylactic medications (12,13). Pharmacologic treatments for acuteheadache typically fall needs to be individualized,taking into consideration key factorsincluding frequency of headache andmedication use, timing of headache (e.g.,early in the morning, menstrualmigraine), severity of associatedsymptoms such as nausea, and need forrepeated treatment. New acute treatments, which currently include a combination ofsumatriptan and naproxen to helpreduce need for second dosing of rescueFigure 1.

Preventive treatment needs to be considered early in treatment. This is especially true if headache-relateddisability is >3 days/month, when symptomatictreatments are contraindicated, ineffective, or leading tooveruse. Also, if there are any profound bouts ofdisability, including prolonged auras, neurological deficits,or migrainous infarcts, prevention should be immediatelyconsidered. Preventive fall into the categoriesof b-blocker, calcium channel blockers, tricyclics,antidepressants, and certain neurological medications usedin other settings, such as anticonvulsants, which may havebenefit in the setting of headache. Similar to acutetreatments, preventive treatments need to be individualizedbased on level on comorbid insomnia, anxiety, depression,and vasospasm, as examples. Patients may have varyinglevels of side effects (e.g., sedation, fatigue, weightchange) which may alter available treatment options. In addition to acute and preventive medications, injection and interventional therapies performed bytrained specialists may be required in certain refractorycases such as with cervicognenic headache, occipitalmigraines, or headache associated with significantmyofascial spasm. These procedures may includetreatment of dysfunction at the level of the joint, nerve,or soft tissue, and include radiofrequency or chemicaltreatments such as injections with a continuum of agentsbased on severity (e.g., sterile water, anesthetic,corticosteroid, and botulinum toxin). Nonpharmacologic Interventions In conjunction with discussion of pharmacologic andinterventional options, it is equally important to introduce nonpharmacologic interventions, which represent a diverse group of therapies (Figure 2). In 2000, the US Headache Consortium, a multidisciplinary group representing both primary care and specialty clinicians, concluded that nonpharmacologic treatments were well suited for patients who have: a preference for nonpharmacologic treatment; poor tolerance of, contraindications to, or insufficient response to pharmacologic treatment; planned to become or currently are pregnant or nursing; a history of long-term, frequent, or excessive analgesic or acute medications; and exhibited significant stress or deficient stress-coping skills (14).Trigger Management One of the most important aspects of nonpharmacologicmanagement is trigger management. Since the vastmajority of headache sufferers report some type of triggerfor their migraine, an overview of triggers can be used toidentify therapies that the patient is most motivated topursue. One of the most commonly identified triggers isdiet. We look closely at nutrition, in order to get rid oftrigger foods, and fortify potential areas of deficiencies.Our end goal is not only to reduce headache, but tocreate an appropriate, health-promoting, anti-inflammatory diet. When discussing trigger foods we often discuss \"Aware of the A's\" as a quick reference for trigger food avoidance,which includes allergenic foods, such as gluten; additives,such as those found in processed or packaged foods;artificial ingredients, such as sweeteners; aged foods, suchas cheese, wine, sauerkraut, or cured meats; and alcohol.Other important aspects of diet management includegetting appropriate protein intake and avoiding excesspro-inflammatory fat. One study demonstrated that areduction in dietary fat, and preferably a transition fromsaturated and trans fats to mono- and polyunsaturatedfats (from 60 g/day to 30 g/day), demonstrated areduction in the frequency, intensity, and duration ofmigraines, in addition to medication use (15). Dietary Supplements for Headache After discussing dietary triggers and transitioning to amore optimal diet, supplements can address areas ofnutritional deficiency and/or suboptimal energymetabolism. If you consider migraine in the migraine state and replacement canprovide symptomatic benefit. Additionally, recent researchsuggests that the efficacy of supplements\u2014B vitamins inparticular\u2014may be determined by genetic factors thatinfluence DNA haplotypes(16,17). Several of the more common supplements usedin headache management are reviewed below. Magnesium is important for many enzymatic conversions and may cause increased inflammatory burden whendeficient in the diet. Unfortunately, most people do notget enough magnesium, since 68% of US adults consumeless than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) and 19% consume less than 50% of the RDA. Importantly,those who consumed less than the RDA of magnesiumwere 1.48 to 1.75 times more likely to have elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), which is linked to a number ofinflammatory conditions (18). T reatment appears safe in most groups. In a study of 118 children with migraine, it was demonstrated that 9mg/kg magnesium oxide daily was more effective thanplacebo in reducing headache frequency and severity (19).Absorption and gastrointestinal effects are variable, anddifferent formulations (i.e., oxide, sulfate, chelated forms)may needs to be attempted. Of note, vitamin D can bepredictive of optimal magnesium absorption, so checkingand correcting vitamin D deficiency should also be a partof the headache and dietary supplement evaluation (20). Riboflavin (vitamin B2) has also been shown to be effective in reducing headache days, although it may notsignificantly change the intensity or duration of episodes(21-23). Side effects are rare but, like with magnesium,may include diarrhea. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may also be deficient in headache sufferers (as found in 1/3 of adolescent migrainesufferers) and appears safe and effective in the pediatricpopulation. Replacement of 1 to 3 mg/kg per day in theadolescent population or 300 mg in the adult populationappears to decrease headache frequency and disability (24,25). Butterbur (Petasites hybridus root) was originally used for allergenic disorders, so conceptually it may be effective instabilizing the spreading inflammatory phenomenon seenin migraine. The recommended dosage that has beensuccessful in decreasing migraine in adults is 150 mg/day, and in children 25 to 50 mg twice daily (31,32). Most of the trials use the Petadolex \u00aeformulation, which is typically well tolerated, other than mild gastrointestinal adverse events. Research on feverfew (T anacetum parthenium ) has been very mixed, and may be based on the formulation utilized (26-29). New formulations, such as a sublinguallyadministered feverfew and ginger may be effective foracute treatment of migraine when administered duringthe mild pain phase (30). When recommending any dietary supplement, several key points need to be emphasized. In most cases, thesesupplements need to have 3 to 4 months of compliancefor appropriate benefit evaluation, especially when tryingto improve deficiency or cellular energy production. On apractical basis, it is important to educate the patient onwhy he or she is taking it, where to get it, what brand tobuy, how to use it, and potential side effects. Clear directions on finding and using supplements can help decrease the confusion that can often occurwhen attempting to identify a supplement on the shelf, aphenomenon we call the Supplement Stare Syndrome , which happens to both clinicians and patients. Oneapproach that has worked at the Scripps Clinic isincorporating a dietary supplement pharmacy, staffed by apharmacist trained in prescription and dietary supplementtherapies. This approach, or a system in which clinicianscollaborate with a community pharmacist or dietarysupplement expert, helps to ensure that the patient iseducated on the different formulations, and has the bestchance of incorporating what is recommended. THE PAIN PRACTITIONER | VOLUME 20, NUMBER 1 | 45(continued on page 49) THE PAIN PRACTITIONER | VOLUME 20, NUMBER 1 | 49Mind-body Therapies Mind-body therapies are an excellent choice for the most commonly identified headache trigger (stress) as well as other common comorbidities such as muscle tension,insomnia, and mood disorders that may often be difficult to resolve. Mind-body therapies, including biofeedback, guided imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, music therapy, relaxation training, and stress management, have been long proven safe and effective in the setting of headache (33,34). Several meta-analyses have shown that the improvement ranges from 30% to 50% versus controlfor both migraine and tension-type headache (35,36). There also appears to be a synergistic impact when these therapies are used with medications with responder rate increasing to over 60% as compared to 30% to 40% with monotherapy (37,38). In addition to gains in common headache comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, one of the most underappreciated benefits of mind-bodytherapies includes their ability to increase self-efficacy in dealing with the burden of headache (39). For example, we use various individualized biofeedback methods\u2014whether thermogenic, musculartension (sEMG), or heart rate variability\u2014in headache, and find it extremely helpful inimproving self-management. Our protocol is to have thepatient meet with the biofeedback therapist once a weekfor 4 weeks with daily homework throughout the periodto reinforce techniques. Most patients will graduate afterthis period, although some patients may need moresessions to fully incorporate techniques. By gaining moreawareness and insight into their condition and thetreatment they are utilizing, patients often gain greaterconfidence and ability in recognizing and self-managingsymptoms and triggers on a long-term basis. Movement Therapies Movement-based therapies have great promise in thesetting of headache, especially when associated withmuscle tension, poor posture, and cervicalgia.Unfortunately, reviews and trials are inconsistent andpoint to the fact that many headache sufferers suffer fromtissue hyperalgesia and need very individualized andgraded therapies to meet their needs. For example,physical therapies appear to be most beneficial for CTTHwhen patients have a high frequency of headacheepisodes. Also, physical therapies for migraine seem to bemost effective when combined with treatments such asbiofeedback, relaxation training, and exercise, lendingmore weight to the concept of an integrative approach(40). When examining the incorporation of movementand physical therapies, including exercise, stretching,massage, manual therapy, manipulation, and craniosacraltherapy, it is important to start slow and utilize therapistsexperienced with headache. Fortunately, it does not take much to gain benefit through movement. A study involving 284 office workerswith chronic headache or neck pain, demonstrated thatan educational and physical program involving simplerelaxation exercises and stretches was effective in reducingheadache frequency, neck and shoulder pain, andmedication use after 6 months (41). We need moreresearch on several of these therapies and who benefitsmost, but we often start with stretching or recommendyoga therapy, which has been shown in a preliminary trialto be beneficial for migraine without aura (42). We haveseveral yoga therapists in our clinic that can demonstrate (continued from page 45)which postures and breathing techniques can be helpful for headache with the goal of transitioning to use in thehome and office setting. Energetic Treatment Because headaches and chronic pain affect patients onmany levels, including physical, emotional, and spiritual,energetic therapies may be especially useful in certain cases.Preliminary evidence points to the benefit of healingtouch among other energy treatments in the setting ofheadache (43). The energetic treatment with the mostevidence is probably acupuncture. This treatment, whichis a component of T raditional Chinese Medicine, has beenused for several thousand years in the prevention andtreatment of multiple conditions, including pain. The recent Cochrane review of 22 trials (n=4419) (44) demonstrated that acupuncture appears to be effective forprevention of migraine headaches, and may be slightlybetter than pharmacotherapy with a strength of evidenceof A, based on consistent and good-quality patient-oriented evidence. Interestingly, acupuncture appears tobe based on a potent unspecific needling effect, thusmaking it difficult to differentiate from sham acupuncturein trials (45). Interestingly, in 4 trials comparingacupuncture with proven prophylactic pharmacologictreatment with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,or valproic acid, acupuncture demonstrated slightly betteroutcomes at 2, 4, and 6 months after randomization, withfewer adverse effects reported (44). Patient-centered Treatments When considering integrative therapies, it is important tonot only consider the evidence for a treatment, but also towhat degree the patient is integrated into the treatment.In many cases, a treatment that theoretically is a perfectfit may not match a patient's preference, understanding,or belief system. This may be true of both pharmacologicand nonpharmacologic options and points to the importance of an open, nonjudgmental discussion regarding goals for therapy, so that the most appropriate and patient-friendly options can be incorporated. Research has suggested that in clinical trials patient preference can often be a strong indicator of treatment outcomes, including level of compliance, follow-up, and benefit. Thus, the treatment(s) initiated is suggested toblend available evidence and patient preference to best ensure safety, compliance, potential benefit, and ongoing clinician-patient dialogue.Putting it all Together When examining how to combine treatments effectively,research demonstrates that simple integration can be bothclinically and financially effective. A study that looked ata low-cost group program, which included supervisedexercise, stress management and relaxation, massage, anddietary education, resulted in an improvement in theoverall frequency, severity, and duration of headaches at6-week and 3-month follow-up (46). In addition,improvements were made in patients' functional status,QOL, health status, pain-related disability, depression.Many education and self-management techniques can bereplicated in a clinic setting to provide more integrativeoptions at a low cost to improve patients' headaches,increase their QOL, and most importantly, empowerthem to manage their pain on their own. Conclusions and Next Steps Headache disorders are often precipitated and exacerbatedby a complex set of factors which can create significantmultisystem dysfunction. Similarly, treatments often need toprovide multipronged support to enable both pain reductionas well as management of significant comorbidities affectingsleep, mood, physical conditioning and social functioning.In many ways, an integrative model, which follows theprinciples discussed, provides a comprehensive, whole personapproach to headache management while empowering thepatient to increase awareness and self-managementapproaches. Such a model also has promise to provide botha more cost-effective and patient-friendly approach toheadache management. The clinician plays a key role inopenly discussing and providing guidance in the appropriateincorporation of integrative options to optimize care. I ROBERT A.
