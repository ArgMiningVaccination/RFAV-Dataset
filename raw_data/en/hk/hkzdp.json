A viral infection causes [genital herpes](/genital-herpes/guide/), and there is no cure for it. But if you have genital herpes, you can use complementary approaches to reduce how often you have outbreaks. Some alternative therapies can also provide relief from discomfort and pain during outbreaks that do occur. \"This kind of viral outbreak [from herpes], and other viruses, like a cold, is usually [related to stress](//www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress/) and your immunity,\" says [Lucy Gade, MD, MPH](https://www.drsadaty.com/rhm-dr-lucy-gade/), a [gynecologist](/gynecologist/guide/) in Roslyn, New York. As a result, an integrative medicine and lifestyle approach to herpes treatment involves making smart choices to foster your general wellness. In doing so, you bolster your immune system's ability to fight the two viruses that cause herpes, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). \"A healthy diet, appropriate sleep, finding ways to decrease [stressors](/stress/guide/) in your life ... these alone will make your herpes outbreaks less frequent,\" says Dr. Gade. Such healthy habits also have the potential to improve your overall well-being, lengthen your life, and boost your happiness. But first, make sure you have an accurate diagnosis for what's causing your symptoms. If You Have Symptoms, Find Out What You're Dealing With \"With genital herpes, the biggest mistake people make is not seeking medical advice,\" says Gade. People often find the [signs or symptoms of a first herpes outbreak](//www.everydayhealth.com/genital-herpes/guide/symptoms/) confusing, says Gade. You may mistake [herpes symptoms for those of a ](//www.everydayhealth.com/sexual-health-pictures/is-it-herpes-or-something-else.aspx)yeast infection and try curing that condition on your own. But if your healthcare provider diagnoses you with herpes, the first line of treatment will be [antiviral medications](//www.everydayhealth.com/genital-herpes/guide/treatment/). \"[Without a diagnosis], you can make matters worse by putting things on the herpes sores that you shouldn't put on the sores,\" she says. People often try using [Vaseline](/drugs/vaseline), [bacitracin](/drugs/bacitracin), or [Aquaphor](/drugs/cetaphil-moisturizing) to soothe the itchy or painful eruptions. \"Honestly, not putting anything on the sores is best,\" says Gade. Do keep the area clean and dry, though. Warm compresses applied to tender or painful areas can help. So can sitting in a warm bath, using [Epsom salt](/drugs/magnesium-sulfate). \"Sometimes people have enormous [pain with urination](//www.everydayhealth.com/urine/what-causes-burning-painful-urination-dysuria/),\" says Gade. For relief, you can urinate in your bathwater or while taking a shower to dilute the urine stream and lessen the sensation. \"You can also use warm water in a spray bottle to dilute the stream while you're urinating.\" Expect the First Outbreak to Be the Worst Remember that although herpes lasts a lifetime, the first outbreak typically causes the most pain, while later outbreaks tend to be much milder. \"You will always have herpes, and the sores will come and go, but you can decide not to treat the current outbreak. If it's not that unpleasant or uncomfortable, some patients will do that,\" says Gade. Some people never have symptoms after the first outbreak, [according to the Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22855-herpes-simplex). Tips for Preventing Future Herpes Outbreaks Boosting and maintaining your immune system through healthy habits forms the basis for an integrative and lifestyle approach to herpes management and prevention. Get Plenty of Sleep for Better Physical and Mental Health Americans are notoriously sleep-deprived, but if you have genital herpes, buck this unhealthy trend. Getting plenty of quality sleep affects every aspect of your life \u2014 your physical and mental health, performance at school or work, and appearance. To improve your sleep hygiene, follow some quick tips from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/sleep_hygiene.html). Upgrade Your Eating Habits Are you eating a \"standard American diet,\" or SAD? That means eating lots of meat, fast foods, and [processed foods](/diet-nutrition/processed-foods-linked-shorter-life-span-study-finds/), and few fresh fruits and vegetables. Such habits not only work against living comfortably with herpes, they also raise your risk for many diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. [Consider upgrading your eating habits](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/index.html) through a few, not-so-hard-to-make changes. \"Eat more veggies. Try to prepare home-cooked food more often. Eat until you are satisfied, not stuffed,\" says [LeeAnn Weintraub, RD, MPH,](https://halfacup.com/) a registered dietitian based in Los Angeles. She considers those three tips to be the first steps to follow for anyone who wants to eat more healthfully. Practice Stress-Reduction Techniques Such as Mindfulness Stress can be a major trigger for herpes outbreaks, so learn and use stress-management techniques, and consider modalities like yoga, meditation, [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/), and counseling. Gade encourages using mindfulness to reduce stress. \"Decide to be mindful of your surroundings and own your experiences,\" she suggests, perhaps through meditation or yoga. You can also simply remind yourself often to pay attention to the present moment as you go through your day, whether you're washing dishes, walking the dog, or in the shower. \"By being mindful, you may feel better overall, and it will decrease your outbreaks,\" says Gade. [Exercise also provides immense benefits](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469) as a stress management tool. Try Taking the Supplement Lysine In terms of taking supplements to prevent breakouts, \"I especially recommend L- [lysine](/drugs/lysine). This is the primary supplement for herpes,\" Gade says. L-lysine (also called \" [lysine](//www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/lysine)\") is an [amino acid](/amino-acids/guide/), a building block of protein. \"When you have an outbreak, it can be taken orally to shorten the outbreak in conjunction with an antiviral medication.\" Lysine appears to be useful in reducing the number and the severity of outbreaks. The usual daily dose is between 1 and 3 milligrams. Some studies suggest that taking lysine regularly may help prevent outbreaks of both [cold sores](/cold-sores/) and herpes sores. In Gade's experience, patients have had no side effects using lysine. In some people, though, there have been reports of the supplement causing [abdominal pain](/abdominal-pain/guide/) and diarrhea, so discuss with your doctor before taking long-term. Herbal Remedies May Also Offer Relief There is some research of varying quality that provides support for using certain botanical remedies for herpes. You may want to try one or more of these: Long Dan Xie Gan Tan This Chinese herbal formula has been used to quell symptoms and reduce herpes outbreaks. Its English name is \"clear liver fire pills.\" In at least one study, the formula was shown to inhibit the activity of HSV-1 and HSV-2. ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18332627/)) Lemon Balm This herb, which is related to mint, has traditionally been used to improve brain function and also has antiviral properties. Records concerning the medicinal use of lemon balm date back more than 2,000 years. ( [3](https://www.herbsociety.org/file_download/inline/d7d790e9-c19e-4a40-93b0-8f4b45a644f1)) Lemon balm can be prepared and drunk as a tea. It can also be applied to the skin to both prevent herpes to prevent outbreaks and reduce symptoms. Research has shown that lemon balm oil directly counteracts herpesviruses. ( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18693101/)) Ashwagandha Known to botanists as Withania somnifera, this plant plays a big role in traditional Indian medicine as a general health tonic. It goes by many names, including Ayurvedic ginseng, Indian ginseng, and winter cherry. Ashwagandha [ helps to support general well-being and reduce anxiety, as well as relieving herpes symptoms, says Gade.
