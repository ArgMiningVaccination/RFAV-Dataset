Our facilities expansion has continued with further renovations to the old Small Animal Hospital building, and a new Education Center in our academic building that will transform the space of the former \"reading room\" into a more student friendly study and group learning space complete with upgraded computers and large HD screens to accommodate groups of students. The hospital renovations include a new home for the Merial shelter medicine student clerkship, which had previously shared space within the surgery lab in the Veterinary Academic Building. The new location utilizes the former surgical suites in the old hospital. This provides ample high quality space for their important teaching and service work. Students report that this rotation is where they gain proficiency and confidence in surgery because of the high volume of procedures and the quality of the instruction. The Victoria I. Ford Acupuncture and Rehabilitation Center, was dedicated in September. We are so grateful to Vicki Ford for all of her efforts in supporting this center through her generous contributions and by being actively engaged and committed to the program's success. The new Acupuncture and Rehabilitation Center houses a new swimming pool and underwater treadmills. There will be hyperbaric and other services added as the area develops. The center will provide services that will be important adjuncts to current therapy and be an active area for research. We are also transforming VS-20 into a clinical skills laboratory where students can perfect clinical skills using life-life animal simulators for techniques such as CPR, bandaging and suturing etc and can have access to canine and feline dental, ear, and eye models. The new Education Center will provide a comfortable and relaxing physical venue to support educational activities within the college. The center will be able to accommodate a significantly larger number of students than the previous space, and will include expanded study areas, upgraded computers and large shared displays to support collaborative and group learning.. Several key appointments occurred this past year including Dr. Paul Cooke as chairman of the department of physiological sciences, Dr. Rowan Milner as chair of the department of small animal clinical sciences and Dr. Dana Zimmel as chief of staff of the UF Veterinary Hospitals. Dr. Pam Ginn was just appointed associate dean for students and instruction. Last year also marked the retirement of longtime small animal clinical sciences chairman, Dr. Colin Burrows. We also recently were saddened by the death of Dr. Woody Asbury, a longtime college faculty member and equine reproduction specialist who served the college in many capacities, including as interim dean.

But their uniqueness as a couple perhaps resides in the fact that they are equally focused on continuing to help each other grow, both personally and professionally. Their commitment defines them, as much because of their humility as by their contributions to the veterinary profession, their community of Hillsborough County and the University of Florida. The Centonzes, who have now been married for 18 years, were both accepted to and attended veterinary school at UF at the same time, graduating in 2003. Both had previous careers: Vincent, who goes by Vince, was a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and served as an officer and retired from the military in 1997 after being stationed all over the world, including Panama, Saudi Arabia and Japan; Lisa, a Princeton graduate, had worked in the Peace Corps in West Africa and met Vince in Virginia when he was stationed there and she was employed at a nonprofit organization that prepared and delivered meals to people with AIDS. Today, Vince is in his sixth year as director of the veterinary technology program at Hillsborough Community College. Lisa is a veterinarian for Hill-sborough County Animal Services, the second largest shelter in the state. The Centonzes are very involved in each other's work; Lisa works as an adjunct instructor at the college and will teach three classes in the spring, and Vince continually aspires to improve the lives of shelter animals through new training initiatives for his students and by frequently volunteering at the shelter. Winter 2012 | 5 \"I knew I wanted to teach ever since vet school, when I began volunteering for (the late) Dr. Kevin Anderson as a teacher's assistant in Anatomy Lab during the fall of my senior year. It's nice to know I had an impact. \" \u2014Dr. Vince CentonzeBoth say their respective work environments have been improved by their mutual commitments, which were as evident in their years as UF veterinary students as they are today. During all four years of veterinary school, the Centonzes regularly volunteered with Operation Catnip. Lisa served as the group's first cat coordinator and as message center manager. \"Vince started wet labs to help teach students cat spay techniques so that they could spay at Operation Catnip,\" said Julie Levy, D. V .M., Ph.D., the Maddie's Professor of Shelter Medicine at UF and Operation Catnip's director. Both Vince and Lisa were active in the Student Chapter of American Feline Practitioners, with Lisa serving as an officer all four years and as president for one year. \"I knew I wanted to teach ever since vet school, when I began volunteering for (the late) Dr. Kevin Anderson as a teacher's assistant in Anatomy Lab during the fall of my senior year,\" Vince said. \"While my classmates were studying for the national board examination, I was spending four hours a day in the lab helping the freshmen.\" His efforts were impressive enough that the college began allowing senior students to obtain elective credit by assisting in teaching the lab. \"It's nice to know I had an impact,\" Centonze said, who enjoyed the experience so much that he offered to fill in to teach the freshman endocrinology class in the fall term following his graduation from veterinary school. \"That sealed it for me,\" he said. \"I knew I had to become involved in teaching.\" After graduation, the Centonzes moved to Tampa, where both began working in private practice. Vince soon heard that HCC was starting a veterinary technology program and was seeking a program director. He applied, but wasn't interested in fulltime work at the time. Two years later, Vince received a call asking if he would consider working as an adjunct instructor for the Veterinary Ethics and Professional Development course.\"I jumped at the opportunity,\" Vince said. \"When the then- program director decided to depart at the end of the spring term, I applied for the position and was selected.\" But although the program had existed since 2005, it had a slow start. Vince was the fourth director in less than two years, and when he arrived there weren't but five students remaining, and no graduates. There were no surgical or radiology facilities and most of the equipment, which had been purchased in 2005, remained in crates, he said. \"There were no general education prerequisites to the program, was no requirement for the students to take courses in sequence and students could take courses without even having to be in the program,\" Vince said. \"To make a long story short, within a year, we had full surgical, radiology facilities, a simulated reception desk and grooming and bathing facilities. We were accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association less than a year after my arrival.\" The program now has a strict progression sequence and standards to remain enrolled; had two full graduating classes of more than 20 students in 2010 and 2011; and has had more than 50 applicants in each of the past two years, necessitating the implementation of limited enrollment and strict admission requirements. \"This program is the accomplishment in my life of which I am most proud...other than getting married to Lisa, of course,\" Vince said, adding that of four accredited programs in Florida, HCC's is now the second largest after St. Petersburg College, \"from which we received invaluable guidance and support when we started our program.\" Her husband said Lisa had been \"absolutely indispensible\" in the program's success to date. \"She was a frequent guest lecturer during my first year as director and volunteered her time for almost three academic years,\" Vince said. \"I relied heavily on her to assist by refining syllabi and by developing lectures and exams. Lisa was as 6 | Florida Veterinarian committed to the success of the program as I was, and we both recognize the importance of properly trained veterinary technicians to practices. \"There are still many practices where veterinarians place catheters, read slides, place endotracheal tubes, etc.,\" he added. \"Veterinarians need to recognize that credentialed veterinary technicians who are trained to perform these functions will allow the veterinarians to spend more time in exam rooms and at the surgery table.\" Students at both the HCC program and St. Petersburg college now participate in a shadowing program at UF, through which veterinary technology students sign up to spend a day at the UF Small Animal Hospital to shadow technicians in specific services. Two HCC graduates have already been hired by UF. In her job as shelter veterinarian at the HCAS in Tampa, Lisa performs spays, castrations and many other surgeries, she said. She diagnoses and treats sick and injured animals, controls infectious disease, examines and treats victims of animal cruelty and neglect and testifies as an expert witness on their behalf. \"This is one of the highlights of my career - speaking on behalf of victims of animal cruelty and attempting justice for them in court,\" Lisa said. \"I love being a shelter veterinarian because I am helping the animals that need it the most - the ones who have no one else, which are abandoned, stray, homeless and abused.\" Lisa has played an important role in strengthening the relationship between HCC and the shelter, which now sends animals over to HCC to receive radiographs or dental cleanings. \"Vince and his students do them for free,\" Lisa said. \"The students benefit from practicing on live animals that need the procedures done and the animals benefit by getting diagnostics and treatments that our shelter cannot provide. In addition, Vince comes in and volunteers at the shelter, doing surgeries occasionally on his day off.\" All animals for live animal laboratories are received from the shelter, Vince said. \"In return, we try to perform procedures on the animals which are beneficial to them, medically necessary or which the shelter would have been unable to perform due to time or resource constraints,\" he said. \"For example, for anesthesia labs, we'll place the animals under anesthesia and then perform spays, castrations or dental exams and cleaning so that we will not have to place an animal under anesthesia for the sake of training alone.\" Lisa also loves to teach and supervises many of the UF veterinary students, as well as some from other veterinary schools, who perform externships at the Hillsborough shelter. \"For the last three years, I have been asked by Drs. Cynda Crawford, Paul Gibbs and Lisa Farina to speak to the freshmen vet students about careers in shelter medicine. This is one of my favorite things to do,\" Lisa said. \"Now that I'm on the UF College of Veterinary Medicine's admissions committee, I get to see students that I have interviewed for admission in the audience of freshmen when I'm speaking to them, which is wonderful.\" In addition to teaching veterinary technology courses at HCC's Dale Mabry campus, Lisa works as an instructor for Penn Foster College, teaching veterinary technology students online. She said Levy, now the Maddie's Professor of Shelter Medicine at UF, and Cynda Crawford, D. V .M., Ph.D., an immunologist who is now the Maddie's Clinical Assistant Professor of Shelter Medicine at UF, were huge role models for her when she was a student. \"I spent almost every Sunday as a pre-vet and veterinary student at Operation Catnip, honing my skills and helping homeless cats,\" Lisa said. \"I was thrilled when they started the Maddie's Shelter Medicine program and only wish it had been \"I love being a shelter veterinarian because I am helping the animals that need it the most - the ones who have no one else, which are abandoned, stray, homeless and abused. \" \u2014 Dr. Lisa CentonzeDrs.

It is a fantastic resource for the students, not just in surgery but also in disaster response, infectious disease control, animal cruelty and veterinary forensics.\" The Centonzes became members of the UF College of Veterinary Medicine's alumni council in 2010. When they're not busy working, they also serve as regular guest hosts for two radio shows: Talkin' Pets with Jon Patch, which is nationally syndicated, and a show they created themselves, called Vet Talk, which appears weekly on Hawk Radio, a station that caters to students at HCC.

In a paper that appeared Oct. 4 in PLoS One, Maureen Long, D. V .M., Ph.D., an associate professor in the college's department of infectious diseases and pathology, and her former graduate student, lead author Melissa Bourgeois, D. V .M., Ph.D., describe their use of high throughput gene sequencing technology to develop a \"brain and immunity chip\" designed especially to characterize all of the changes that take place in the brain at the molecular level during illness and recovery from West Nile virus. The chip is \"We hope this will help us understand why some animals and humans become sick and others succumb to the virus resulting in severe illness, lifelong neurological debilitation and even death,\" Long said. \"Knowing this will allow us to come up with treatments that aid in recovery from illness.\" As part of her dissertation research, Bourgeois created a gene library enriched for neurological and immunological sequences and combed through millions of bytes of data to develop a novel brain chip that even had targets that may be rare but are important in brain disease states. In the end, the equine brain chip consisted of 41,040 genes and included many targets that are important in human psychiatric diseases, like depression and schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease.Long and Bourgeois investi- gated the basic hypothesis that certain families of genes change expression in a consistent manner during West Nile virus infection, as well as during the disease and recovery from encephalitis caused by it. \" Although we knew there were microarrays that had previously been developed for equines, our goal was to create a brain and inflammation-based array to look specifically at how function was affected during brain infection. This chip has applications to many neurological maladies of the horse including Eastern equine encephalitis, Equine rabies, Wobbler syndrome,\" Long said. \"This allowed us to detect changes that would not be common in normal horses.\" The chip itself is essentially a slide with probes that allow it to capture all of the different sequencing associated with equine brain disease. The UF group relied on Agilent Technologies, based in Santa Clara, Calif., which has a patent on the probes that were used. \" Analysis of the data found that many of the psychiatric, Parkinson genes and neuromuscular diseases were triggered,\" Long said. \"Then a computer program that can analyze hundreds of genes simultaneously was used to build models of various disease processes that may be affected in the acute disease and may result in other diseases once the infection is long gone.\" By Sarah CareyResearch Update Sarah KiewelLaura Moon, Dr. Chris Sanchez and Dr. Ali Morton are shown with Boon outside the UF Large Animal Hospital on Jan. 10.

Now, quite literally, and at only 6 years of age, he's in the process of becoming a true model horse. Mariah's Boon \u2014 known affectionately to his owner, Laura Moon, as Boon \u2014 has been chosen as the 2012 Celebration Breyer Horse. The Breyer Animal Creations Company, a subsidiary of Reeves International, manufactures plastic, porcelain and resin model horses. As many children who love horses know, these models are carried in toy stores and tack shops and begin as artist's sculptures. Each year, the company holds BreyerFest, the largest model horse show in the country. The event draws model horse collectors and enthusiasts to Lexington, Ky. In July 2012, BreyerFest will showcase British breeds, including the Drum Horse, a heavy riding horse that includes Clydesdale, Gypsy Horse and Shire bloodlines. Moon learned last summer that Breyer was looking for a Drum Horse with show experience and its own Drum outfit. Boon met the criteria. After his health problems resolved, he's been busy in the show ring, winning such accolades as Grand Champion Stallion at the Florida State Fair for two years in a row and just receiving Grand Champion Drum, Grand Champion Performance Drum and Grand Champion High Point Drum from the Feathered Horse Classic in Georgia. \"I am so proud of him and so pleased with everyone at UF,\" Moon said. Although many a horse owner might covet being selected as the Celebration Breyer Horse, for Moon the real prize is Boon's life, which she credits UF's large animal veterinarians and other staff for saving. After learning about the American Drum breed, Moon brought Boon home from the farm where he was bred when he was just a year old and began showing him at halter and in showmanship classes.After one show, Moon noticed Boon had a fever. When the fever persisted, Moon's veterinarian recommended a trip to the UF Large Animal Hospital. UF veterinarians Chris Sanchez and Laura Javsicas found a basketball-sized abscess in Boon's abdomen. He also had pericarditis, an infection of the sac surrounding his heart. Veterinarians suspected that Boon ate something that penetrated the wall of his stomach and into his chest \u2014 they just couldn't find the culprit. Boon improved initially, but the abscess returned. Boon received a second surgery at UF, during which Ali Morton, D. V .M., created a portal from the abscess to Boon's skin. This allowed improved drainage of the abscess after surgery. Eventually, the hole shrank to the size of a straw. Then one day Moon saw something dark in the catheter. She pulled out a piece of metal. \"I thought it must have come from the ground, but it didn't,\" she said. \"It was in the tube itself.\" A few days later, more metal came out. The culprits were found and the abscess continued to shrink in size. Within five months, the basketball-sized abscess was the size of a golf ball; after a year, it was the size of a grape and Boon looked like he had never been sick. The syndrome, called \"hardware disease,\" is common in cattle but quite rare in horses. \"I still carry those pieces of metal around in my truck,\" she said. \"It was a miracle. I am so thankful the UF veterinarians never gave up.\" By Sarah CareyStallion treated at UF becomes 'model' horseMaria Farias Winter 2012 | 9 Filly in distress triumphs over health hurdles aLt h o u g h t h e j o u r n e y h a s b e e n Lo n g a nD p a i n f u L f o r a r e s c u e D 2-y e a r -oL D q u a r t e r h o r s e n a m e D \"b a b y gi rL,\" the gentle buckskin filly is now on the road to recovery because of surgery in October at UF's Large Animal Hospital, a committed owner, and an ongoing regimen of advanced medical therapy. \"She is very bright and remains upbeat and strong,\" said Theresa Batchelor, president of Beauty's Haven Farm and Equine Rescue Inc., a non-profit organization located in Morriston, Fla. \"She looks good, still loves to eat, and cleans up everything when she gets her meals.\" At the time of her rescue in mid- August, Baby Girl suffered from numerous signs of neglect and injury, including trauma to the right side of her face. She weighed only 295 pounds and could barely eat. \"Baby Girl endured a lot of pain and discomfort for two months before finding her way to us,\" Batchelor said. \"When she arrived, she was starving to death, while fighting chronic infection. She likely wouldn't have lasted another week.\" Beauty's Haven immediately started Baby Girl on a special diet, and within just five weeks, she had gained more than 100 pounds. But the problems with her facial trauma and draining wound continued. An initial surgery performed at another facility in September to remove bone fragments from the right side of the horse's jaw allowed her to start chewing comfortably, eat more and gain additional weight. However, the wound on Baby Girl's face was not healing so Dr. Michael Porter, who owns an advanced mobile diagnostic practice and frequently examines horses at Beauty's Haven, referred Baby Girl to UF for a CT scan and surgery. The scan revealed that a large bone fragment was still present between her jawbone and her skull at the level of her temporomandibular joint. The fragment was dead and a large portion of the bone of both her jaw and skull was severely infected.Ali Morton, D. V .M., an associate professor of large animal surgery, told Batchelor that the only viable approach to tackle the animal's problems would be to surgically remove the problematic bone fragment. However, she knew the procedure would be very risky due to the proximity of the skull bone. \"Dr. Morton wouldn't even give us 50/50 odds that she would come through the surgery,\" Batchelor said. \"It was pretty grim. I felt like someone had kicked me in the gut. Yet at the same time, I felt relieved to know what was really going on.\" Morton said the horse's fracture was unusual and in a very difficult location. \"The CT scan was critical to identification of the problem and for surgical planning,\" Morton said. \"We are very fortunate to have this type of advanced- imaging capability.\" Morton said that in addition to Baby Girl's fracture, the CT also revealed that she had severe infection of the bone of her jaw and of the thin bone of the base of her skull. \"The fragment was located just millimeters from this bone and the bone was so severely affected that it was questionable if it was even completely intact in the area covering her brain just next to the fragment that had to be removed,\" Morton said. Among the many hurdles Baby Girl had to overcome were recovery from two anesthesia procedures associated with her CT scan and surgery, recuperation from her severe infection and the healing of her wound. \"With the help of Kesmarc Farm, we added hyperbaric oxygen therapy to her antibiotic therapy, and Baby Girl has responded to every step amazingly,\" Morton said. \"She is still not completely out of the woods, but she is healing beautifully so far. She is a special little horse, tough as nails, and loved by many.\" By Sarah Carey Richard Gonzmart and Rusty 10 | Florida VeterinarianRestaurateur uncorks special vintage to benefit UF Small Animal Hospital to ri c h a r D go n z m a r t , p r e s i De n t a nD a f o u r t h - g e n e r a t i o n m e m b e r o f t h e f a m i Ly t h a t r u n s ta m p a ba y's c e n t u r y -oL D coLu m b i a re s t a u r a n t , ru s t y t h e Do g i s m o r e t h a n a p e t. h e's p a r t o f t h e f a m i Ly. When Rusty, a 5-year- old German shepherd, was diagnosed with bone cancer, it felt like one of his children was sick, Gonzmart said. He sat in waiting rooms and watched as families waited for their loved ones to come out of surgery. He saw the anxiety on their faces. To his relief, veterinarians at the UF Small Animal Hospital discovered that Rusty didn't have cancer after all. He had a fungal infection that looks similar to bone cancer when an X-ray is taken. Gonzmart understood the heartache of being a parent of an animal diagnosed with cancer. To help, the restaurateur created his own blend of wine, called 2004 Rusty Red Wine, as a fundraiser. Only 600 bottles will be produced by world-class winery O. Fournier in Argentina. About 70 percent of the proceeds from the wine will go to the UF Small Animal Hospital's oncology unit and about 10 percent will go to several Humane Society branches in cities where Columbia's seven restaurants are located in Florida. Gonzmart said his goal is to donate $20,000 a year to the oncology unit. Gonzmart has pledged $100,000 to the oncology unit, said Nick Bacon, Vet.M.B., a surgical oncologist at UF's Small Animal Hospital. \"I saw so many people in the waiting room with their family members, their four-legged family members. I know the pain,\" Gonzmart said. \"It's just a great way to help people and give people hope.\" Rusty is doing well since he started treatment for the fungal infection but will probably need lifelong therapy to manage the disease, said Alex Gallagher, D. V .M, who is treating Rusty.Photo courtesy of Richard Gonzmart\"Mom and Dad report he's happy, jumping around, running up and down the stairs,\" Gallagher said. \"He's doing a lot better than the average patient.\" Gonzmart attributes Rusty's health to UF's Small Animal Hospital veterinarians' high level of skill and determination to give Rusty the best quality of life possible. \"We're blessed to have such a great animal hospital,\" Gonzmart said. \"If we hadn't gone there, we would've had to put him down.\" Rusty, a trained personal protection dog, has rolled down the window of Gonzmart's car, leaped out the window and would have tackled a nearby man with a gun had Gonzmart not called him back, he said. \"He would give his life for me,\" Gonzmart said. So when Rusty got sick, it became a family matter. Gonzmart and his wife, Melanie, often bring Rusty to the gleaming-white hospital atrium with another four-legged family member in tow. Rex, also a German shepherd, sits in the waiting room with the rest of the family. At checkups, Rusty gets an X-ray, his blood is drawn and he gets a physical exam. Had he not been so lucky \u2014 had the lesions been bone cancer tumors \u2014 the process would be different. Bacon says veterinarians can present owners with up to 10 to 12 treatment options when an animal is diagnosed with cancer. The family chooses the option that best fits their needs. He said many people want to feel like they still have some control in the midst of cancer. The treatment options can range from radiation treatment to surgery to pain pills \u2014 but they all are aimed at improving the pet's quality of life. \"The goal is to make their lives better,\" Bacon said. In addition, there's a chance the discoveries the Small Animal Hospital makes in dogs can help treat people. \"It's a fantastic model for human cancer,\" Bacon said. He said Gonzmart's donation helps the Small Animal Hospital stay focused on its mission of helping patients. Donation money goes toward education, student research programs, internships, day-to-day needs such as microscopes and large research projects, including those involving bone cancer, skin cancer and bladder cancer. \"It was an astonishingly generous thing to do,\" Bacon said.

It was there that she discovered chemistry, and what would become a lifelong love of science and research. By the time she graduated \u2014 as a chemistry major \u2014 from Mary Washington College, Denslow had an internship at the National Institutes of Health under her belt, along with two publications. She also had presented her honors research at a local American Chemical Society meeting. She then attended Yale University for a master's degree in biochemistry and molecular biology, and decided to take a hiatus. \" As most women at the time, I wasn't sure I could handle being married, having children and having a job as a scientist, so I quit, got married and had my first child,\" said Denslow, Ph.D., a professor of physiological sciences and at UF's Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology. Her husband, David Denslow, Ph.D., eventually accepted a faculty position at UF, where he is now a professor of economics. After moving to Gainesville, Nancy Denslow recommitted to her scientific love and enrolled in the doctoral program in the College of Medicine's department of biochemistry and molecular biology.Research Spotlight \"I had a great time learning how to do research and studying about mitochondrial ribosomes and raising a family,\" said Denslow, who had a second daughter soon after completing her Ph.D. A short time later, she landed a job as technical director of the Proteomics Core of UF's Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology. She brought in mass spectrometry technology and created new methods for helping UF researchers with questions about proteins. She soon started the ICBR's Biomarkers Core Facility and established 2D electrophoresis as a service. One of her first clients, an investigator from the Environmental Protection Agency's laboratory in Gulf Breeze, Fla., brought fish that had been exposed to poly aromatic hydrocarbons and other endocrine compounds, and presented with hepatocellular carcinomas. \"He wanted me to analyze their blood for potential biomarkers,\" Denslow said. \"We did, and found vitellogenin, the egg yolk protein responsive to estrogen, had been induced in male fish. This suggested that some of the contaminants were estrogen- like and were inducing male fish to produce female-specific proteins. The significance of the finding changed her research path. \" After some research, we decided to make monoclonal antibodies against the biomarker. We were among the first to document the problem of estrogens in the U.S. waterways with wild fish.\" She said the research fascinated her because it was fundamental and basic, yet resolved a real issue and thus it was easy to see its practical application. Now Denslow is known for pioneering the introduction of molecular approaches to ecotoxicology, as well as for her collegial and enthusiastic approach to collaborative research and her endless appetite for science. She received the Pfizer Award for Research Excellence from UF in 2007 and was named a UF Research Foundation professor in 2009. She cofounded two startup companies at the Biotechnology Development Institute, but modestly credits colleagues \"who were willing to take the risk with me.\" What she most enjoys at UF is working with students, postdoctoral associates and staff. \"It is especially fun to solve a new problem or get new answers to issues that are facing us all in the environment,\" Denslow said.

V .M., a veterinary pathologist, has been named associate dean for students and instruction at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine following a national search. Ginn has served as a member of the college's faculty since 1992. She will begin her new duties immediately and will assume full responsibilities in March, following the retirement of Paul Gibbs, B. V .Sc., Ph.D. from the position. \"Dr. Ginn has received numerous awards for teaching excellence and has a long-standing interest in students,\" said the college's dean, Glen Hoffsis, D. V .M. \"She is a great addition to the college administration and will provide strong leadership to the Office for Students and Instruction.\" Ginn has most recently served as a consulting pathologist for Specialty VETPATH in Seattle, Wash., and as an adjunct professor of pathology in the college's department of infectious diseases and pathology. She was an associate professor in that department from 1998-2007. Ginn received her D. V .M. degree from Colorado State University in 1983 and worked in small animal practice prior to entering UF's pathology residency program, which she completed in 1992. In 2011, Ginn was honored for her teaching by the American College of Veterinary Dermatologists, which presented her with its Excellence in Teaching Award. She was named Teacher of the Year by junior UF veterinary students in 2003 and again in 2006.In 1998, she received the UF veterinary college's prestigious Norden Distinguished Teacher of the Year Award. Ginn's goals include becoming informed about the learning styles of current generations of students and using this information to benefit the educational experience of veterinary students and the faculty that teach them. She also has a keen interest in addressing student debt load, streamlining the time frame of the educational process and expanding career options for veterinarians that would help make the One Health Initiative a reality for veterinarians. As a mother of three children, Ginn also plans to work to help students gain skills to help them lead a professional life that enables them to set priorities for living a balanced life. She loves to teach and plans to continue to contribute to the education of the students and future veterinary pathologists. On a University and community level, she would like to participate in projects that promote inclusion of individuals with disabilities in the educational process. \"Technology and the ease of access of information in today's digital world present new opportunities for improving methods of information delivery and assessing student learning,\" Ginn said.

What's perhaps less commonly known is that the character of Winter's veterinarian, played by Harry Connick Jr., is loosely based on none other than the University of Florida's Mike Walsh, D. V .M. Walsh, who is associate director of the College of Veterinary Medicine's Aquatic Animal Health program, also performs veterinary services at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, which is where Winter has resided since being rescued by scientists from the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce back in 2005. Aquarium staff contacted Walsh, who was director of veterinary services at Sea World in Orlando at the time, to ask his advice about how to best obtain blood samples from the impaired dolphin. \"I first had contact with Winter when she was a baby, and because she was missing her tail, there was confusion as to how to get blood samples from her on a regular basis to keep track of what was happening with her,\" Walsh said. \"The probability of infection was high, so we needed to monitor blood on a regular basis.\" Winter had lost her tail because the blood supply to it had been cut off when she was tangled in the buoy line, Walsh said. He recommended that samples be taken from the peduncle, the area between the dorsal fin and the tail since it could not be obtained from the tail, which is standard for obtaining blood samples from most dolphins but was impossible in Winter's case. A year or so later, Walsh was serving as the park's veterinarian. Many companies and individuals had approached the park about creating some type of prosthetic tail, but deciding whether this was a feasible option - as an alternative to euthanasia - and what the safest approach was, took some time, Walsh said. Eventually the park wound up working with a company called Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics of Waterville, Maine. \"They had the best idea for achieving the goal without hurting Winter's skin or causing other problems, and we thought that working with David Yates' team at Clearwater was going to be a long term benefit for Winter,\" Walsh said. He added that Winter's success from a medical perspective was greatly impacted by Janine Cianciolo, D. V .M., who took care of her after her injury and nursed the dolphin, along with other members of the aquarium's team, through infection, wound healing and growth. Five years later, Winter is doing well, Walsh said. However, he cautions that managing her tail is an ongoing, lifetime issue. \"The challenge with Winter is coming up with solutions to a problem that no one has dealt with before,\" Walsh said. \"This is where the College of Veterinary Medicine excels.\" When filming took place for the movie, Walsh spent a day at the park with Harry Connick, Jr., talking to him about various medical issues experienced by animals there, including showing the star how some stranded sea turtles were being treated. Others from UF have also played an important role in Winter's care over the past few years, including Carolina Medina, D. V .M., chief of the college's acupuncture and rehabilitation service, and Nicole Stacy, D. V .M., a clinical pathologist By Sarah Carey Dr. Mike Walsh and Winter at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.

Farina's award was announced Dec. 6 during the annual meeting of the ACVP , which was held in Nashville. Journal article receives award An article that appeared in Veterinary Pathology in 2010 and was coauthored by several faculty members from the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, has received the 2011 C.L. Davis Foundation Journal Award. The foundation's national advisory board's selected the paper, \"Canine H3N8 Influ- enza Virus Infection in Dogs and Mice,\" as the best original article published in Vet- erinary Pathology in 2010. The award was presented Dec. 5 in Nashville, Tenn. at the annual meeting of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists. Accepting the award on behalf of the authors was Dr. William Castleman, the paper's lead author and a professor of veterinary pathology at the UF CVM. The paper described pathologic lesions in racing greyhound dogs as well as in pet and shelter dogs naturally infected with the H3N8 influenza virus. This virus causes a serious and highly contagious respiratory disease in dogs and lesions associated with the virus serve as diag- nostic indicators of the infectious disease in diagnostic laboratory medicine. Dr. Woody Asbury dies Woody Asbury, D.V.M., one of the found-ing fathers of the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine and a former administrator whose contributions to college life spanned nearly 20 years, died in Versailles, Ky., on Nov. 17 after a long illness. He was 80 years old and his career had included private equine practice and consulting as well as academia, through which he helped many veterinary students and theriogenology residents. Asbury retired in April 1996 after serving the college as a teacher, a clinician and an administrative leader. Among his leader - ship roles were serving as chairman of the original department of reproduction; as chief of staff of what was then known as the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital; as chairman of the department of large animal clinical sciences, the job he held when he retired, and notably as interim dean of the college from 1988-89.Surgeon receives Hill's Mobility Award Dr. Dan Lewis, a professor of small animal surgery and the Jerry and Lola Collins Eminent Scholar in Canine Sports Medicine and Compara- tive Orthopedics at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, has been named the 2012 recipient of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Hill's Mobility Award.

D e p a r t m e n t o f ag r i c u Lt u r e , report that a single dose of an immunocontraceptive vaccine controls fertility over multiple years in adult female cats. Funded by Morris Animal Foundation, a nonprofit organization that advances veterinary research to protect, treat and cure animals, the five-year study was published in August online in the scientific journal Theriogenology. The scientists hope their findings will aid in the registration and use of the vaccine to help manage overabundant feral cat populations humanely. \"Millions of free-roaming feral cats exist in the United States and in other countries around the world,\" said Julie Levy, D. V .M., Ph.D., the lead researcher and director of the Maddie's Shelter Medicine Program at UF. \"Unfortunately, their welfare is not always adequate, and they can have a negative impact on public health and the environment. \"We're hoping this research will lead to a nonlethal method of control for feral cat populations that is less expensive, labor-intensive, and invasive than current methods, such as surgical sterilization,\" Levy said. GonaCon was developed by researchers at the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service National Wildlife Research Center. The NWRC is the federal institution devoted to resolving problems caused by the interaction of wild animals and society. The UF researchers involved in the testing do not have any licensing agreements with the USDA or any commercial interests in the vaccine. In the study, 15 adult female cats received a single shot of the vaccine called GonaCon while five received a placebo. Following the injections, the female cats were allowed access to a breeding male cat and observed for breeding activity. All five placebo females became pregnant seven to 28 days after the male cat was introduced. Cats injected with the vaccine, on the other hand, remained infertile from five months to more than five years. All of the cats were adopted at the end of the study. \" A total of 93 percent of the cats treated with GonaCon remained infertile for the first year,\" Levy said. \"In subsequent years, we saw a steady and expected decline in infertility as antibodies to the vaccine decreased. However, numbers were still quite high, with 73 percent of the cats remaining infertile during the second year, 53 percent in year three, 40 percent in year four, and 27 percent in year five when we ended the study.\" Although permanent sterilization is ideal, the relatively short lifespan of many free-roaming feral cats suggests that a contraceptive that blocks fertility for several years may be successful in reducing the population. Joyce Briggs is president of the Alliance for Contraception in Cats & Dogs, a group advocating for non-surgical birth control methods to humanely manage populations of cats and dogs. She called Levy \"a key player in efforts to advance new methods of fertility control.\" \"We are intrigued by this study,\" Briggs said. \" Although a permanent sterilant would be ideal, a long-acting contraceptive could be an effective tool for managing feral cat populations, especially where surgery is unavailable or impractical.\" GonaCon is currently registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use on female white-tailed deer; however, the vaccine has also proven successful with numerous other mammal species including feral horses, bison, elk, prairie dogs and ground squirrels. The single-shot, multiyear vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies that bind to GnRH, a hormone in an animal's body that signals the production of sex hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. By binding to GnRH, the antibodies reduce its ability to stimulate the release of these sex hormones. All sexual activity is inhibited, and animals remain in a nonreproductive state as long as a sufficient level of antibody activity is present.
