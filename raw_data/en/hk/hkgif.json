Dr. Dacus has been serving residents of Mansfield, TX for many years, and combines therapies that are proven to improve health and wellness. Our doctor takes a holistic approach to patient care, meaning he searches for and identifies the underlying cause of the condition instead of just treating the symptoms. Patients often wonder \"what type of treatment will you do for me\" or \"what can I expect when I come in for a visit\". One simple answer is to get you to function the way you want to function without limitation. Function can mean house chores, work, sleep, care for children or even run a marathon! It is unique for each patient. Limitations can include limited movement or stiffness, pain, and weakness. Our treatments are geared to fix, improve or maintain function without limitation! We need you to be able to sit, stand, move and sleep the way you are meant to. Most of our therapies involve movement. We may move things or we may instruct you how to move things to reach your goals. A treatment plan focused on proper movement will obviously help... you guessed it, MOVEMENT. Also, movement-based therapies can help improve the different conditions that can affect sleep! So, if you want to move and sleep better, that is what we focus on! At the True Balance Chiropractic and Physical Therapy center, we provide a myriad of services to meet the needs of our patients. Our services include, but are not limited to the following: We also have a physical therapist on staff, who will work with you to strengthen your body and further improve your range of motion. Working with a physical therapist is also beneficial because it reduces your chances of being injured again in the future.
