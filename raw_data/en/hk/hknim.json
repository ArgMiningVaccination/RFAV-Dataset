It had the aim of evaluating whether reiki or prayer is effective in relieving pain during cesarean section. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review with meta-analysis conducted at Botucatu Medical School, UNESP, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The following were searched to March 2016: MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and CENTRAL. Randomized controlled trials published in English or Portuguese were included in the review. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A GRADE table was produced to evaluate the risk of bias. RESULTS: There was evidence with a high risk of bias showing a statistically significant decrease in pain score through use of reiki and prayer, in relation to the protocol group: mean difference = -1.68; 95% confidence P < 0.00001; I2 = 92%. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Evidence with a high risk of bias suggested that reiki and prayer meditation might be associated with pain reduction. KEY WORDS: Spirituality; Delivery, obstetric; de medicamentos, a fim 0,00001; I2 92%), com o uso de reiki Complementary therapies have been practiced since ancient times, but there is still little scientific evidence on their real efficiency. Most of these therapies originated from oriental cultures, such as in India with Ayurveda treatments; China with acupuncture and moxibustion therapies; and Japan with reiki therapy. Moreover, complementary therapies are implemented both alone and alongside conventional medicine. Thus, complementary therapies tend to take a holistic approach in order to treat the entire person, i.e. body, mind and soul. In other words, they use a comprehensive set of techniques, such as meditation, body therapies, energy manipulation, art and music therapy, dietary therapy and other procedures that involve healthcare, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.11.

The term comes from combining two Japanese words: rei, a universal spirit; and ki, meaning universal life energy.11. Lee MS, Pittler MH, Ernst E. Effects of reiki in clinical practice: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials. Int J Clin Pract. 2008;62(6):947-54. Despite being a Japanese form of healing, use of reiki has already spread worldwide. It is mainly used for pain relief.22. vanderVaart S, Gijsen VM, de Wildt SN, Koren G. A systematic review of the therapeutic effects of Reiki. J Altern Complement Med. 2009;15(11):1157-69. Additionally, prayer meditation is also considered to be an adjunctive therapy involving a non-invasive method with a low-cost procedure.55. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

J Altern Complement Med. 2009;15(11):1157-69. compared reiki therapy with the usual care or with placebo among women undergoing breast biopsy, women with abdominal hysterectomies, cancer patients, individuals with depression, and chronically ill patients. However, that review seemed to have serious limitations with regard to its methodological aspects. For example, it presented a variety of conditions, i.e. 12 articles were included and therefore 12 different types of conditions, but there were no data on pregnant women. In other words, the review was quite generalist. Moreover, it did not use the GRADE approach to rate the quality of scientific evidence. Consequently, the review was unable to provide any conclusion about the effectiveness of reiki and the suggestion made was that new studies on this topic would be necessary. In the literature, a few studies11. Lee MS, Pittler MH, Ernst E. Effects of reiki in clinical practice: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials. Int J VM, de Wildt SN, Koren G.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to evaluate whether reiki or prayer meditation is effective for controlling pain among women undergoing cesarean section. METHODS The Cochrane Handbook for Intervention Reviews1212. Higgins JPT, Green S. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2011. Available from http://handbook.cochrane.org/. Accessed in 2016 (Dec 13). [http://handbook.cochrane.org/... ](http://handbook.cochrane.org/) guided our choice of methods. Our reporting adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement.1313. Moher D, Liberati A, Tetzlaff J, Altman DG; PRISMA Group. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: the PRISMA statement. BMJ. 2009;339:b2535. Eligibility criteria We included RCTs or quasi-RCTs that compared reiki therapy and prayer meditation with the usual care among pregnant women undergoing cesarean section, including any of the following maternal outcomes before and after receiving the intervention or usual care: pain control; heart rate; diastolic and systolic blood pressure; or medication intake. Furthermore, a single study99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al. The effect of distant reiki on pain in women after elective Caesarean section: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. BMJ Open. 2011;1(1):e000021. recorded postpartum physical activities through the Milestone questionnaire. Data source and searches Pertinent literature was identified through MEDLINE (from 1966 to March 2016); Embase (from 1980 to March 2016); LILACS (from 1982 to March 2016); and Cochrane controlled trials (CENTRAL) (up to March 2016), using the terms spirituality, reiki, prayer, cesarean and labor pain ( [Table 1]()). The data-gathering was restricted to Portuguese and English-language studies. There were no publication status restrictions. A review of relevant references in previous systematic review articles11.

Search strategies used in MEDLINE (via PubMed), CENTRAL, LILACS and Embase Selection of studies Randomized controlled trials or quasi-RCTs published in English or Portuguese were included. Two reviewers, working independently, screened all titles and abstracts that were identified through the literature search. Furthermore, they selected potential studies by obtaining the full-text articles, and then evaluated them, in accordance with the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment Two reviewers independently screened all the potential quantitative results or critical data from some preselected studies, with regard to the participants, interventions, control conditions, outcome measurements and results. Subsequently, disagreements between the reviewers were discussed with the ninth author, in order to reach a consensus. The reviewers independently assessed risk of bias by using a version of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias.1414. Higgins JP, Altman DG, G\u00f8tzsche PC, et al. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. BMJ. 2011;343:d5928. This includes nine domains: adequacy of sequence generation; allocation sequence concealment; blinding of participants and caregivers; blinding of data collectors; blinding for outcome assessment; blinding of data analysts; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and presence of other potential sources of bias not accounted for in the previously cited domains. For incomplete outcome data, we stipulated that low risk of bias consisted of loss to follow-up of less than 10% and a difference in missing data between the intervention and control groups of less than 5%. Certainty of evidence The reviewers used the Grading of Recommendations for Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of scientific evidence for each outcome, which was categorized as high, moderate, low or very low.1515. Guyatt GH, Oxman AD, Vist GE, et al. GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. BMJ. 2008;336(7650):924-6. The GRADE approach assessed the following: overall risk of bias,1616. Guyatt GH, Oxman AD, Vist G, et al. GRADE guidelines: 4. Rating the quality of evidence--study limitations (risk of bias). J Clin Epidemiol. 2011;64(4):407-15. imprecision,1717. GH, Oxman AD, Kunz R, al. GRADE guidelines: 6. Rating quality evidence--imprecision. inconsistency,1818. R, al. GRADE guidelines: 7.

GRADE guidelines: 5. Rating the quality of evidence--publication bias. J Clin Epidemiol. 2011;64(12):1277-82. Thus, the results were summarized in an evidence table, i.e. as a GRADE evidence profile. The reviewers independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias and data abstraction. Disagreements were resolved by reaching a consensus or by obtaining a third reviewer's opinion if needed. Data synthesis and statistical analysis We pooled the data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a fixed-effect model by considering the last follow-up outcome that had been measured in each study included. We assessed heterogeneity by means of the I2 statistic and evaluated the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE method. All of the analyses were conducted using the Review Manager (RevMan) software.2121. Cochrane Community.

[http://community.cochrane.org/sites/defa... ](http://community.cochrane.org/sites/default/files/uploads/inline-files/RevMan_5.3_User_Guide.pdf) RESULTS Selection of titles A total of 1,866 titles were identified in the databases cited above, but only 34 studies were selected for detailed evaluation.1212.

Accessed in 2016 (Dec 13). [http://handbook.cochrane.org/... ](http://handbook.cochrane.org/) Ultimately, it was found that only three studies that included 343 patients were eligible for the current review ( [Figure 1]()). These studies presented different interventions, i.e. distant reiki,99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al.

In the literature, all reiki healers consider that distant reiki99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al.

Effects of Reiki Post-caesarean Delivery Pain, Anxiety, and Hemodynamic Parameters: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial. Pain Manag Nurs. 2015;16(3):388-99. because all the information from this study with regard to the prayer meditation background, the objectives of the study and the methods used to evaluate the intervention were in line with these other studies.99.

Moreover, these factors were in line with our aim in this systematic review, which was to evaluate perceived pain among women undergoing cesarean section. Moreover, both reiki and prayer meditation are non-invasive and non-pharmacological practices, and both of them can be considered to be spiritual interventions.11. Lee MS, Pittler MH, Ernst E.

BMJ Open. 2011;1(1):e000021. showed that there was no statistically significant difference between distant reiki and the usual care in any of the following categories: time to first hunger; time to first eating of solid food; time to first flatus; time to first bowel movement; time to first spontaneous voiding; and time to first ambulation ( [Figure 1]()). Moreover, the same study99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al. The effect of distant reiki on pain in women after elective Caesarean section: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. BMJ Open. 2011;1(1):e000021. described the patients' need for opioids, but showed that there was no statistically significant difference between distant reiki and the usual care on the day of admission to hospital (relative risk, RR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.30; P = 0.64; I2 = not applicable); or on the next day (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.74 to applicable) ( [Figure 2]()). DISCUSSION This study evaluated the use of reiki and prayer meditation for pain control among women undergoing caesarean section. It was the first-ever study to evaluate spiritual healing in relation to this issue, given that most previous studies and reviews focused on severe chronically ill patients and their quality of life.11.

Thus, it was necessary to restrict the current systematic review to English and Portuguese-language studies were assessed from the outset. However, no study was excluded because it was written in another language, because no such studies were found through the search methods. A recent study2222.

In another study on women in the southern and midwestern United States regions (i.e. extremely religious areas) the proportion that received prayers for health was estimated to be 53%.2323.

Additionally, the more religious the people are, the more likely it is that they will use preventive healthcare.2020. Guyatt GH, Oxman AD, Montori V, et al. GRADE guidelines: 5.

In addition to the methodological limitations, this current review also presented a limitation relating to the results obtained through meta-analysis: although the perceived pain seemed to have decreased significantly, the heterogeneity of results was extremely high, i.e. I2 = 92% ( [Figure 3]()). This can be explained by the fact that there were three different types of intervention. On the other hand, regular and distant reiki work in the same way as foundations for this type of therapy99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al. The effect of distant reiki on pain in women after elective Caesarean section: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. BMJ Open. 2011;1(1):e000021. and, therefore, they were not different at all. Moreover, prayer meditation is a form of adjunctive therapy within many cultures.1111.

Southfield: Vision Publications, 2001. Thus, both prayer meditation and reiki are forms of spiritual healing. According to Benor,2424. Benor DJ. Spiritual healing: scientific validation of a healing revolution. Southfield: Vision Publications, 2001. spiritual healing is defined as a systematic and purposeful intervention by practitioners that has the aim of helping other people to improve their health condition through focused intention, which can include hand contact or hand movement. Thus, these three studies99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al. The effect of distant reiki on pain in women after elective Caesarean section: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Within systematic reviews, it is known that meta-analyses that included less than 10 studies cannot to estimate heterogeneity. The meta-analysis did not show any statistical significant differences from before to after the treatments, either in the intervention or in the usual care group, regarding heart rate ( [Figure 4]()), [6](), respectively). In other words, these results were concordant with those of the previous review.22. vanderVaart S, Gijsen VM, de Wildt SN, Koren G. A systematic review of the therapeutic effects of Reiki. J Altern Complement Med. 2009;15(11):1157-69. However, to reach definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of such therapies, larger populations in good RCTs are needed. With regard to the methodological aspects, the present review noted that there were risks of bias relating to random sequence generation;99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al.

This concern corroborates what was reported in the systematic review on reiki conducted by Vandervaart:22. vanderVaart S, Gijsen VM, de Wildt SN, Koren G. A systematic review of the therapeutic effects of Reiki. J Altern Complement Med. 2009;15(11):1157-69. all of the 12 studies included had failings in at least in one of the following areas: randomization, blinding and accountability of all patients. Therefore, both reviews can be classified as presenting low-quality evidence, and the main issue in this regard is the poor evidence from the RCTs. We sent emails to the respective corresponding authors of the studies selected for this review,99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al.

Acta Med Iran. 2014;52(12):909-15. regarding points in these studies that were unclear to us or not reported, but no replies had been received by the time of submitting this review. The previous review22. vanderVaart S, Gijsen VM, de Wildt SN, Koren G. A systematic review of the therapeutic effects of Reiki. J Altern Complement Med. 2009;15(11):1157-69. attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of reiki therapy under several conditions and presented 31 different outcomes within the 12 studies included. Not all of these studies were RCTs; no meta-analysis was performed, and the findings were based on Jadad scores. The previous review also did not include any study on pregnant women undergoing a cesarean section. On the other hand, the present systematic review included three studies99. Vandervaart S, Berger H, Tam C, et al. The effect of distant reiki on pain in women after elective Caesarean section: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. BMJ Open. Eser I.

Acta Med Iran. 2014;52(12):909-15. in which there were similarities regarding methods, outcomes and populations, based our evidence from the GRADE profile for continuous outcomes ( [Table 3]()), and this review also included a meta-analysis. Additionally, the major limitation of the current study was that only a very small number of studies considering spiritual healing approaches to pain management after cesarean section have been published. Therefore, there is still a need for high-quality RCTs on this issue, with the aim of assessing the real effectiveness of reiki and prayer meditation in relation to pain control among women undergoing cesarean section. CONCLUSION Low-certainty evidence suggested that use of reiki and prayer meditation might be associated with pain reduction.
