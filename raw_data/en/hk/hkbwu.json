Acting as coordinator for several clinical trials, he has evaluated the effectiveness of natural products in the treatment of obesity, prostate disease, and cardiovascular concerns. So we asked him what one should do before getting their COVID vaccine. Read on to see what he said\u2014and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Signs Your Illness is Actually Coronavirus in Disguise. 1 Recommendation #1 It is often an overlooked fact that the actual conferred benefits of any vaccine require a competent immune system. In reality, the stronger an individual's immune system, the more responsive they are to a vaccine. This obvious interactive relationship between the vaccine and immune response is my first recommendation: Make sure that your immune system is as healthy as possible prior to receiving the vaccination. The relative health of your immune system is going to vary based on any number of factors, but the basic premise is important independent of your age or health status. 2 Recommendation #2 To accomplish Recommendation #1, you need to add supplemental immune-supportive nutrition (and eat a healthy diet). Supplemental nutrition is the most direct way to impact your immune health and function in the near term, and the following nutrients are essential as a part of your immune-boosting efforts. Vitamin K2 (as MK-7), Vitamin D3, Vitamin C, Zinc, and Omega-3 from either concentrated fish oil or vegan sources like Ahi Flower. Adding supplemental nutrition prior to being vaccinated (and continuing it after you receive your vaccine) will boost and support your immune health from a natural perspective. 3 And Speaking of Vitamin K2 Recent research, as completed by my co-author, Dr. Grace McComsey, indicates that insufficient levels of Vitamin K2 (and Vitamin D3) are directly related to our susceptibility to COVID-19 and the seriousness of the outcomes should you become hospitalized. Vitamin K2 and Vitamin D3 work synergistically to improve our body's ability to mount a robust immune response and regulate healthy inflammation. Vitamin K2 is very hard to get in the standard American diet (SAD), and so supplementation with Vitamin K2 (as MK-7) is absolutely critical on a daily basis. 4 Recommendation #3 This one is personal to me and relates to my own conservative approach to vaccination. Just because you receive the vaccine doesn't mean that you should ignore and abandon the logical choices we know from well-documented, global research work to keep us safe from COVID. That means, from a public/social perspective, we should continue wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and maintain the hygiene habits that prevent the spread of the virus and its variants. What you do at home with your family, who may all also be vaccinated, can be a different matter. However, the large public position should be that we stay the course and keep up with those things we know keep us safe. 5 Final Words from ETNT Health \"I certainly hope these simple yet effective and research-driven recommendations are helpful and beneficial to your long term health!\" says Dr. Myers. As always, talk to your own doctor if you have concerns about your well-being.
