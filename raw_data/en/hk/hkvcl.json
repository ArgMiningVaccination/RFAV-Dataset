Immunization is the only preventive prophylaxis against rabies and serological screening for Rabies Virus Neutralizing Antibodies (RVNA) will determine the success rate of immunization. In case of immunity failure the efficacy of in use vaccines should also be determined because there are various factors that can destroy the efficacy of vaccines. Another development that is direly needed by rabies facing countries is the availability of gold standard Rapid Florescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT). Initiation of this test in all rabies facing countries will enable these countries of self reliance in the field of serological screenings to detect rabies protective immunity that is a basic requirement to combat this deadly hazard.
