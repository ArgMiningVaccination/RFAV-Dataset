These are just some of the at-home solutions for gas, and chances are they're already in your kitchen. Although everyone experiences gas, some people are troubled by it more than others. At times, [excessive gas](https://www.everydayhealth.com/digestive-health/treatment-for-excessive-gas/) can become uncomfortable or even painful. But simple changes to your diet can provide gas relief and also aid digestion. In addition to over-the-counter gas relief products, items commonly found in the kitchen may double as gas relievers. Herbs for Gas Relief A number of herbs with so-called carminative properties may help ease gas and prevent [bloating](https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/health-answers/seriously-bloated-warning-signs-you-shouldnt-ignore/), according to Angela Lemond, RDN, a dietitian and nutritionist based in Texas and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She explains that a carminative is a substance that aids in the expulsion of gas. Ginger is often considered a carminative for its [gastrointestinal](/digestive-health/common-digestive-conditions-from-top-bottom/) effects. A [systemic review published in January 2020 in the journal Nutrients](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/1/157) found that out of studies that analyzed ginger's effect on different gastric functions, 85 percent reported ginger as a digestive enhancer. As it relates to gas relief, faster digestion allows gases to move more quickly out of your small intestine to relieve discomfort and [bloating](/digestive-health/is-bloating-cause-for-concern/). Additionally, a [systemic review published in January 2019 in Food Science & Nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341159/) found that ginger was an important dietary agent in helping prevent [dyspepsia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/7316-indigestion-dyspepsia) (upper [abdominal pain](/abdominal-pain/guide/)), flatulence, and bloating. FDgard, a nonprescription formulation designed to help manage dyspepsia, uses other herbs to achieve similar results. The primary active ingredients are caraway and peppermint oils. Some doctors recommend this for gas and bloating, and a [study published in March 2022 in BMC Gastroenterology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8900420/) found that this combination also helps with dyspepsia. Other herbs and spices that may provide gas relief include: - Chamomile - Dill - Fennel - Basil - Caraway - Cumin - Parsley - Peppermint - Spearmint Lemond notes that you should always get approval from your doctor before taking an herbal supplement. She suggests trying to gain the benefit of carminatives from the food you eat rather than by taking supplements, which she says should be taken with caution. \"Some people think of herbal supplements as natural or straight from the earth, so they may be taken at will, but a lot of them have pharmaceutical effects and could interact with medication,\" she says. Gas, Stress, and Probiotics Gas can be worsened by stress. \"There are nerves up and down the GI tract,\" Lemond says. \"People who have a tendency to be nervous can develop gas, diarrhea, or [constipation](https://www.everydayhealth.com/constipation/guide/).\" When [dietary changes](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/gas-and-bloating/why-healthy-diet-may-cause-gas/) aren't effective, other treatments such as relaxation therapy may help. Stress can contribute to causing spasms in the colon and abdominal discomfort, according to a [review published in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2249749/). Reviewers noted that progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, yoga, counseling, or changes to daily stressful situations can help reduce stress and have a positive effect on [digestive health](https://www.everydayhealth.com/digestive-health/tips-for-better-digestive-health/). More studies are beginning to explore the role of stress and psychological factors and their impact on [irritable bowel syndrome](/irritable-bowel-syndrome/) (IBS). In a [study published in July 2020 in Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386351/), researchers found that an increase in stress was associated with people with IBS when compared with the study's control group. For a time, researchers were exploring the direct connections between the gut, brain, and [probiotics](/probiotics/guide/), as probiotics were thought to be a way to aid digestion and reduce [excessive gas](/digestive-health/treatment-for-excessive-gas/). But the evidence on probiotics remains thin. In fact, in June 2020 the [American Gastroenterological Association](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(20)34729-6/fulltext) released guidelines outlining that for most digestive conditions, there is not enough evidence to support the use of probiotics. Over-the-Counter Gas Treatments That May Help If gas doesn't move quickly enough through the digestive system, it can cause bloating and discomfort. A few changes to your daily routine and habits can bring relief from gas and bloating. [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/patients-and-families/meals-and-nutrition/bwh-nutrition-and-wellness-hub/special-topics/gas-beat-the-bloat) in Boston suggests these behaviors to help decrease bloating: - Eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly. - Eat smaller meals, more frequently. - Sit up straight after a meal. - Walk after a meal. - Drink room temperature beverages. Products at your local pharmacy to reduce [gas and bloating](https://www.everydayhealth.com/digestive-health/10-ways-get-rid-bloating/) generally contain [simethicone](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/simethicone), [activated charcoal](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/activated-charcoal-functions-benefits-risks-where-to-buy/), or a food enzyme known as alpha-galactosidase (the active ingredient in Beano) to help break down [hard-to-digest foods](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/gas-and-bloating/top-gas-producing-foods/) like beans and certain vegetables. Although some people find these drugs to be effective, others don't. Alpha-galactosidase contains the enzyme that the body lacks to digest certain carbohydrates in beans and certain vegetables, but the enzyme has no effect on gas caused by fiber or lactose. [Lactase](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/lactaid) tablets or drops may provide gas relief for those with [lactose intolerance](https://www.everydayhealth.com/lactose-intolerance/guide/). The tablets are taken right before consuming milk or milk products. \"Occasional excessive gas is normal,\" Lemond says. But when gas continues to be a problem despite dietary adjustments and home or over-the-counter gas treatments, it's a good idea to see your doctor. Additional reporting "}
