Please read our [disclosure policy](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/privacy-policy/). This DIY essential oil room spray will freshen any space. I keep bottles of diy room spray in the bathroom, living room, etc. Did you know that most conventional room freshening sprays on the market contain toxic ingredients? This is why I started making our own DIY essential oil room spray. The products that we think are simply making our home smell good, are actually negatively effecting our health. Most room sprays contain chemicals and fragrances that contain known carcinogens (substances that cause cancer), endocrine disruptors (chemicals that mimic hormones and can lead to many problems such as fertility issues), and neurotoxins (which affect brain activity and can cause headaches & more). This is why I started making my own diy essential oil room spray. It's made of plant-based and naturally derived ingredients, and freshens the air in your home without toxins or harmful ingredients. Why Essential Oil Room Spray? Essential oils are concentrated extracts harvested from nature. They are distilled and cold pressed from plants, herbs, and trees. These pure oils are natural and contain powerful, concentrated health and wellness benefits. This means, that this essential oil room spray actually benefits your health, instead of harms it. Use different blends of oils based on your desired purpose. This diy room spray can calm stress, purify the air, help you sleep, etc. To purchase essential oils to make this diy room spray, please sign up using this link: [Young Living Essential Oils](https://www.youngliving.com/us/en/referral/31270904) and enter my number #31270904.
