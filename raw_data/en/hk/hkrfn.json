Our primary goal is to create safe and potent herbal products for your family's health and vitality. We are located on an 80 acre certified organic farm in the rolling hills of Pennsylvania, just east of the Appalachian Mountains. On a typical summer day one might find us in the field planting, weeding, or harvesting vibrant fresh herbs and preparing them for the extraction process. The other part of our dedicated staff may be mixing, pressing, testing or bottling herbal extracts. QUALITY MATTERS. In addition to herbs grown on our farm, we partner with a variety of wild crafters, growers and suppliers, who provide us with some of the best quality herbs available. The quality of our finished product reflects the high quality of the fresh or dried herbs we use. Because we care about sustainability and conservation of the plants God has given us we support the work of United Plant Savers and are careful in our use of At-Risk herbs. From herb to extract, products are made following current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) at our FDA inspected facility. High quality herbs, careful attention to detail, and many quality checkpoints from raw herb to final product ensure amazing herbal products that your family can use with confidence. As a manufacturing company selling herbal products we cannot make disease treatment claims and are limited to talking about normal healthy body function and structure. For more specific information on how you can use herbs for your health we recommend working with a health practitioner or doing your own research. THANK YOU! We are grateful for your trust and support. You can be sure we will continue to produce quality herbal products for your family's health, at reasonable prices. We wish you and your family God's blessings of peace, health and happiness.
