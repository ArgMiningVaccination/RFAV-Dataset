Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\" Psalm 23: 5b-6 Don't you just LOVE the wonderful fragrances of essential oils?! The Bible is full of references to essential oils. In Exodus 30:24 the Lord instructs Moses to make a sacred anointing oil of [Myrrh](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/myrrh-oil), Cinnamon, Calamus, and Cassia. Frankincense and [Myrrh](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/myrrh-oil) were gifts of the Magi to the Christ child. Jesus was anointed with oil shortly before his death, and after his death, Joseph of Arimathea brought Sandalwood and [Myrrh](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/myrrh-oil) to bury him. Essential oils have been revered for thousands of years. Essential Oils can Cancel the Action of a Homeopathic Remedy Before discovering homeopathy several years ago, my health journey took me through discovering nutrient dense foods, herbs, and essential oils. It took me many years to realize that essential oils and homeopathy were two completely different healing modalities. In [My Journey to Homeopathy - Part 1](https://motheringstrength.com/how-i-discovered-homeopathy/), I confessed that for many years I thought that essential oils and homeopathy were one-in-the-same. Essential oils are NOT homeopathy. Homeopathy is different. In fact, essential oils can antidote homeopathy, so it is important to understand how they can be used to compliment one another. Like many people, I discovered essential oils when I was looking for a natural alternative to over-the-counter drugs. My family suffered from environmental allergies and my daughter learned of the benefits of essential oils from a naturally-minded friend. We began using high-quality essential oils from [doTERRA](http://my.doterra.com/cathidiaz) and were very impressed with the benefits. What are Essential Oils? All essential oils are made from the concentrated oils of plants. They are used to support the body's ability to heal itself. Each essential oil has its own individual fragrance and healing properties. Although they do not contain any vitamins or minerals, it is believed that the aromas in essential oils elicit powerful physical, mental, and emotional responses that help the body achieve a state of balanced health and wellness. How is Homeopathy Different? Homeopathy is a completely different healing modality than essential oils. Essential oils are exclusively derived from plants, whereas homeopathic remedies are derived from plants, animals, minerals, and substances of all kinds. Essential oils nourish the body. Like healthy foods or nutritional supplements, essential oils can be used daily and continually. When the body is well, essential oils can sustain and optimize the state of wellness. When the body is sick, essential oils can help move the body back toward a state of health. Whereas, essential oils give the body material support, homeopathic remedies are so highly diluted as to have no remaining physical properties. It is theorized that homeopathic medicines interact with the body as electromagnetic frequencies or nanoparticles. Because homeopathy is not physical, it stimulates a healing response at an energetic level. Homeopathy is Medicine Furthermore, homeopathy operates under the principle of The Law of Similars, or \"like heals like.\" Homeopathy stimulates the body's defense mechanism by treating it with ultra-dilute doses of a substance that produce symptoms similar to those of the illness. For this reason, homeopathy is medicine. It is primarily used when symptoms present. The symptoms are assessed and the correct homeopathic remedy is chosen that matches the \"symptom-picture\" of the individual. Unlike essential oils, homeopathic remedies are not used in an on-going manner. When the person is very much better, the remedy is discontinued. This is a very important distinction between essential oils and homeopathic remedies. Essential Oils in the Camphor Family Antidote Most Homeopathic Remedies Another important thing to be aware of is that essential oils can stop the action of a homeopathic remedy. In particular, essential oils in the Camphor family are known to antidote most homeopathic remedies. This is extremely helpful in a case where an ill-chosen homeopathic remedy has been given. If the wrong homeopathic remedy is chosen and the symptoms worsen, or new symptoms present, a few good whiffs of a high-quality, [Peppermint essential oil](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/peppermint-oil) will stop the action of the remedy. On the other hand, [oil of peppermint](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/peppermint-oil) should be avoided when taking a well-chosen homeopathic remedy, so as not to interfere with the positive action of the remedy. I always keep [Peppermint essential oil](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/peppermint-oil) on hand in case I need to antidote a homeopathic remedy. Oils that Will Antidote a small percentage of camphor. They can be used in conjunction with homeopathy if an individual is not sensitive to these oils. Mint Toothpaste can Antidote Homeopathy Many homeopathy users avoid mint toothpaste because it can cancel the action of a homeopathic remedy. I saw this first-hand when my children woke up in the middle of the night with a stomach bug. I was awakened to the sound of my daughter vomiting in the bathroom. I grabbed my homeopathy kit and chose Arsenicum album 30c, which is a premiere remedy for vomiting. She rinsed her mouth with water and I gave her a dose. She immediately felt relief and went back to bed. No more vomiting. About an hour later I was awakened again, this time by my son vomiting. Again, I grabbed the Arsenicum album 30c. However, before I could stop him, he grabbed some mint toothpaste, popped it in his mouth and rinsed with water. I gave him the dose of Arsenicum album 30c. However, within a few minutes he was vomiting again. I had him rinse his mouth with water only. We waited about 15 or 20 minutes and then I gave him another dose. This time the remedy acted, his vomiting ceased and we were both able to go back to bed. Store Essential Oils and Homeopathic Remedies in Separate Areas of Your Home Because homeopathy is energy medicine, the physical environment in which the remedy is placed can antidote a remedy. For this reason, homeopathic medicines and essential oils should be stored in a separate location. In my home, I store my essential oils in the bathroom and keep my homeopathy kits on the bar near my kitchen. Homeopathy is My Go-To Medicine but I Use Essential Oils Every Day Because homeopathic remedies work so effectively, they are my \"medicine of choice\" for my family. However, essential oils have remained a big part of our wellness plan. Essential oils are non-toxic and can replace many chemical-laden personal-care and cleaning products. Benefits of Essential Oils: - Cleansing and purifying: Essential oils are a non-toxic alternative to chemical-laden household cleaners. They leave your home smelling wonderful without fear of poisoning your family or causing cancer. - Immune Support: Essential oils have anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties. They help your body to hold the pathogens in-check without destroying all the beneficial microbes that your body depends on. - Mood balance: Essential oils are known to address mood imbalances. Some oils uplift, others sooth and calm. There is an oil for whatever mood support is needed. How to Use Essential Oils: [Diffusing:](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/pl/diffusers) The inhalation of essential oils, also known as aromatherapy is known to improve physical and emotional health. The concentrated oils are inhaled from the air, where the oil molecules enter the bloodstream and are carried to every part of the body. There are many ways to diffuse essential oils: [electric diffusers](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/pl/diffusers), [essential oil sprays](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/ultra-fine-continuous-mist-sprayer-2-pk), or even just putting a few drops of oil on a porous surface, such as clay or [100% wool](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/abode-dryer-balls), and allowing it to dissipate. [Topically:](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/using-essential-oils) Many oils are known for their anti-inflammatory and immunostimulant properties. When applied to the skin, essential oils are absorbed immediately. The molecules are so small that they readily enter the bloodstream and are carried to every part of the body. Many quality oils can be applied directly to the skin, but it is recommended that most oils be applied in combination with a carrier oil, such as olive oil or [fractionated coconut oil](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/usage-fractionated-coconut-oil-carrier-oil), for best results. [Household Cleaning Products:](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/onguard-cleaner-concentrate) Essential oils are the ideal natural purification products for our homes. Properties in many essential oils have a reputation for being antiseptic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral. Be sure that the oils that you use are pure, therapeutic grade oils. I trust [doTERRA](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/site/cathidiaz) Essential Oils because they are 100% pure, natural, and rigorously tested for quality. I like doTERRA [On Guard](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/pl/doterra-on-guard-products) cleaning products and use them in my home. [On Guard](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/pl/doterra-on-guard-products) smells wonderful and acts as a disinfectant. However, because it contains Eucalyptus, I am careful not to use it around an open bottle of my homeopathic remedies. I also love [lemon essential oil](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/lemon-oil). It can be used neat (undiluted) or mixed with water or vinegar. It makes a great all-purpose cleaner. [Lemon essential oil](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/lemon-oil) is amazing for removing grease or the sticky glue residue left from labels. For personal-care products, I avoid essential oils that will antidote homeopathy. There are many other essential oils, that are not in the Camphor family that are safe to use with homeopathy. Because essential oils have such a strong aroma, if I need to take a homeopathic remedy, I separate using essential oils from taking a homeopathic remedy by at least 15 minutes. Some Essential oils that are Safe to use with Homeopathy and Some of their Properties: [Arborvitae](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/arborvitae-oil)- cuts, burns, mouth sores, mouthwash, any wounds - [Lavender](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/lavender-oil) - For anti- bacterial and joints, [Lemon](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/lemon-oil)for cleansing, [Wild Orange](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/wild-orange-oil)for pick-me-up and [Frankincense](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/doterra-frankincense-touch-blend-oil)for deep healing. My daily fragrance is [Cheer roll-on](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/doterra-cheer-touch-uplifting-blend-oil), my fragrance for special occasions is [Whisper](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/whisper-touch-oil), and I use [Balance deodorant](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/natural-deodorant-infused-with-doterra-balance-essential-oil)daily. Two other family favorites are [InTune](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/in-tune-oil)and [Console](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/doterra-console-touch-comforting-blend-oil). Each of these single oils and oil blends are homeopathy-friendly. I stopped using On Guard liquid hand soap and now I make my own hand wash with homeopathy friendly oils. I simply fill a soap dispenser with water, mix a squirt or two of [pure castile liquid soap](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Pure-Castile-Liquid-Soap/dp/B000HJXQ9G/ref=sr_1_5?crid=HRKQR7AGBWNT&keywords=castile+soap&qid=1659989618&sprefix=castile+soap%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-5), and add a few drops of essential oils, such as [Clove](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/clove-oil), [Wild Orange](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/wild-orange-oil) and [Lemongrass](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/lemongrass-oil). I still use [OnGuard cleaner](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/onguard-cleaner-concentrate) on my floors and bathrooms surfaces, always keeping my homeopathic remedies separated. When I diffuse essential oils, I am careful to diffuse away from my homeopathic remedies and I don't diffuse any essential oils in the Camphor family. One Last Tip for Integrating Essential Oils with Homeopathic Remedies Any homeopathic remedy can be administered in water. This is referred to as an \"aqueous dose.\" When the homeopathic medicine is added to the water, the entire amount of water in the container becomes potentized with the remedy. This is a convenient way to administer a remedy and it also stretches the remedy, which saves money. Since homeopathy is energy-medicine, the quantity of the remedy makes very little difference in terms of a dose. However, the frequency, or how often the remedy is taken is extremely important. Frequency guidelines should always be followed. (Learn more about these guidelines in one of my guided study group. [Contact me](https://motheringstrength.com/contact/) for more information.) For the purpose of our discussion, it should be noted that once the remedy is made into a water dose, it can be used simultaneously with non-camphorated essential oils without fear of cancelling the homeopathic remedy. For example, when I sprained my ankle, I put my remedies in a water bottle and kept it by my bedside, taking the remedy as needed. I also rubbed the appropriate essential oils on my ankle to encourage healing. Here are the general guidelines for making a water or aqueous dose: - Drop 2-5 pills into 4-8 ounces of water - 1 sip = 1 dose - Doesn't matter if it's a teaspoon or a tablespoon - Frequency is based on severity of symptoms.
