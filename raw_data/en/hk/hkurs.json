Conserving paper: printing two pages per sheet Adjusting the size of the on-screen pages Why is the font so large in the PDF files? The font has purposely been made large so as to allow two pages to be printed on one sheet of paper. Printing two pages per sheet requires that your software scale-down [i.e. reduce the size of] each page. If the font were normal size, the reduced version would be extremely difficult to read. Conserving paper: printing two pages per sheet To print two pages per sheet of paper, in the \"Page setup\" setting on your computer, chose \"Multiple page: 2-in-1\" or \"Print 2 up\". You may need to experiment a bit, especially with the 'orientation' setting: portrait ( ) or landscape ( ). Some software will automatically print in landscape orientation when '2-in-1' is chosen; others will need to be set to landscape explicitly. (In the software installed on my own computer, for example, when I select \"2-in-1\", the program says \"portrait\" and then proceeds to print in landscape. Go figure. But, as I say, you may need to experiment a bit.) Try printing only a few pages initially, until you get the hang of the peculiarities of the print software installed on your own computer. Adjusting the size of the on-screen pages You may find the font in the PDF files so large as to make them difficult/uncomfortable for you to read on your monitor.

A good introductionto the subject must convey the sense of excitement that characterizeslively controversies. Doing this well - avoiding the mock combat ofstraw men and articial opponents - is far from easy, which is whyrelatively few good introductions are the work of one single writer.The present book is an exception to this rule. F r Norman S artz has o w managed to combine a good sense of the complexities that always lurk behind the surface of philosophical issues with an easy, nontechnicalmode of exposition accessible to the interested nonspecialist. His bookis at once readable, infor mative, and stimulating. One can lear n about philosophy by reading, but one can lear n to philosophize only by thinking about the issues. But philosophical thinking requires recourse to problems, concepts, and methods, andthese are obtained most efciently and effectively via the printedpage. What a book can do is to extend a congenial invitation to lear n-ing. The difculty is nding books with the right combination ofaccessibility-with-profundity and of breadth-with-depth. In this re-gard, the interests of the beginner - student or interested reader alike -are well served by Beyond Experience which, I have found, provides constantly stimulating discussion of a wide range of challenging ques-tions. The very nature of philosophy is such that it is easier to pose problems than to enforce conclusions. Even the plausible data of theeld - the deliverances of ' plain logic ', of ordinary common sense,and of science - are not of so xed a character that they always resistthe corrosive impact of critical scrutiny. Moreover the ' data ' ofphilosophy (whatever they are) underdetermine the conclusions: thereare always alter natives that must be weighed by standards that webring to our philosophizing rather than extract from it. T present o philosophy in a dogmatic way is accordingly to betray the enterpriseviii F rewordo by impoverishing it - by putting out of sight concepts, issues, and problems that deserve and need to have their place in philosophy 'scomplex terrain. In this connection, what is particularly appealingabout this book is its undogmatic approach. Its author is more con-cer ned that readers should appreciate the many-sidedness and com-plexity of the issues than that they take away a predilection for oneparticular answer. This insistence on readers thinking for themselvesrather than pressing for the endorsement of one particular view iscertainly one of the book 's most attractive features. Those who give Beyond Experience an attentive reading are in for a treat. They will come away not only with a better sense of what phi-losophy is all about, but will also experience the enjoyable stimulus ofthinking philosophically. Nicholas Rescher University Professor of PhilosophyUniversity of PittsburghAcknowledgments F ur colleagues, three of whom I have never met, have played essen-o tial roles in making it possible for me to bring this book into being. William Saywell, the president of Simon Fraser University, took it upon himself to recommend to the board of governors a sabbaticalleave for me under special ter ms for the academic year 1988-89.Without his condence in the project, his enthusiasm, and his arrang-ing supplementary nancial support, I would not have been able toundertake writing this book. If William Saywell provided the opportunity, Nicholas Rescher provided the sustenance. In the fall of 1988, when I had written aboutthe rst third of the manuscript, I read Rescher 's editorial in theAmerican Philosophical Quarterly : A substantial divide apparently separates the issues that intrigue philosophers themselves from those which non-philosophersthink that philosophers ought to discuss. F r, like other profes- o sionals, we philosophers favor shoptalk over popularization andprefer addressing our colleagues and ' the public ' at large. Weincline to salve our consciences with the comforting reassur-ance that our eld has become too technical for that sort ofthing. But has it? P rhaps we have simply become too impatient to e deal with the complexities of simple exposition and self-indul-gently prefer technicalities laden with presuppositions andlaborsaving complexities to the clear and patient discussion offundamentals. A considerable host of philosophers from Hume to Russell and beyond show that it is possible to do both technical philos-ophy and popular communication - occasionally even in oneand the same book. ... If philosophy loses out on its educativex Acknowledgments mission towards the reading public at large, the fault lies not in our stars - or in the very subject - but in ourselves. ([172], 1347) Once you have read chapter 1 in this book, you will understand why I was startled and delighted to nd Rescher writing this. On oppositesides of the continent, we were simultaneously writing identicalthoughts about the practice of philosophy. I sent him immediatelywhat I had already written, and he wrote back, encouraging me in myeffort and graciously accepting my invitation to write the F reword to o this volume. But his kindness did not end there. Throughout the yearthat followed, when I often became exhausted and discouraged, Res-cher kept pushing me on with reassurances and suggestions. There isno way I can repay him. But neither - I am sure - does he expectrepayment. All I can hope is that someday I might, in tur n, be privi-leged to pass such generosity on to some other writer. If Saywell was the impetus and Rescher the sustainer, then Ron Schoeffel, senior house editor, and Bill Harnum, marketing manager,at the University of T ronto Press, were the patrons. I had earlier dis- o cussed this project with some other editors, but they had war ned thatthe general public would not read philosophy. Schoeffel and Harnumreacted differently. They were not willing to ' write off ' the generalpublic, believing that not just university students and their teachers,but nonacademics as well, have both an appetite and an ability to readserious philosophy. But it must be clear that a book of this size cannot have called upon the assistance of just four other persons. Many others, as well, con-tributed substantially to this volume. The British Columbia provincial gover nment, under its W rk / Study o Program, and Robert Brown, the dean of arts at Simon Fraser Univer-sity, provided funding for my two stalwart research assistants, Hyne-Ju Cho and Ar min Meyerholz. Moira Gutteridge, a friend and colleague ( Fraser V lley College a and Capilano College), drew the splendid illustrations for chapters 8and 11. Lorraine Ourom, executive editor at the Press, was in charge \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. Abbreviated citations are used throughout this book.

Throughout the months of preparing the manuscript for publication, she good-naturedly accommodated aninordinate number of fussy requests from this author. John St Jamescopy-edited this book. Unfortunately, a good copy-editor 's contribu-tion to a book, unlike a good illustrator 's, is by its very natureinvisible. But those who have seen my original manuscript and haveseen John 's expert, extensive, and indispensable repair of it knowwhat a considerable improvement he has wrought. Probably unwisely,I have sometimes refused his advice. What stylistic idiosyncrasiesoccur, I assure you are my own. Two readers who were engaged by the University of T ronto Press, o and who remain anonymous, painstakingly read the penultimatedraft of the manuscript. They provided a number of astute suggestionswhich I have been pleased to adopt, and they caught some errorswhich I have corrected. But I am sure that they have not spotted everyerror or challenged me on every unclarity. In due course, readers maytell me what these are. But whatever these errors may tur n out to be, I,who wrote them, am alone responsible for them. Dennis Bevington and Professors John Len Berggren, Raymond D. Bradley, Roger C. Buck, W rren Goldfarb, Raymond E. Jennings, a Hugh Johnston, E.L. P ttullo, Mark Skinner, Kenneth B. Storey, Don a T dd, and Robert T dd provided invaluable assistance in trackingo o down some of the bibliographical materials I needed. Professors Harvey Gerber, Leigh P lmer, and Lawrence Dill oblig- a ingly lent a hand with certain details in mathematics, astronomy, andichthyology, respectively. And the editors of Analysis, The Canadian Journal of Philosophy , and Ratio kindly gave permission for me to reprint, as sections of chapters in this book, revised versions of certain of my earlier papers.The particulars of original publication are to be found herein as foot-notes at the outset of each of the relevant sections. The curator of theJoseph Regenstein Library, University of Chicago, gave me permis-sion to quote from the unpublished papers of Clarence Darrow. Last to be mentioned, but foremost in importance, is Sylvia, my wife and helpmate. Throughout the thousands of hours I spent work-ing on this book, by her quiet encouragement and unfailing love, sheprovided the needed perspective and balance. F r she is the secure o reminder that I am rst a husband and a father, a son and a brother,and then - but only then - a philosopher. February, 1991Preface to the second edition All known typographical errors in the rst edition (T ronto: Universi- o ty of T ronto Press), 1991, have been corrected. There are, in addition,o numerous small changes throughout. A postscript (pp. 144ff ), further exploring the matter of out-of-body sensations, has been added to chapter seven. I would like to thank the many university and college instructors who have adopted the rst edition for use in their metaphysics courses. Thanks, too, to all those - instructors and students alike - who havewritten to me with comments, questions, and suggestions. By making this book available, both as a single le and as multiple les (chapter-by-chapter), I hope instructors who wish to use selectedchapters as parts of their course materials will now nd it easy to do so.

The short answer is that I have written this book for my two children, Diane and Efrem. At various times during their growing-upyears, they asked me, \" Dad, what is philosophy? \" I explained to themthat the question \" What is philosophy? \" has no easy answer; that theywould need to take a course or read a book to nd the answer. Andthus it was, in part, a desire to answer their question that prompted myundertaking to write this book. But in the meantime, they have eachgone on to university and have each taken philosophy courses. And sofrom their teachers, they both have lear ned what philosophy is. IndeedDiane has even acquired a postgraduate degree in philosophy. F r o them, then, this book has tur ned out to be not so much an introductionto philosophy per se as it is an entree to their father 's own thoughtsabout philosophy, it is, one might say, a testament of their Dad 's inter-ests and reflections. But this book was scarcely undertaken solely for my children. I also had a much wider audience in mind. And it is to you of this wideraudience I now tur n to make a few remarks explaining what I try to doherein. In a way, the question \"F r whom is this book written?\" is a remark- o ably contemporary question, very much the sort of question which arises naturally in the age where an education is no longer reserved fora privileged few. F r nowadays it is the fashion when writing ' lear ned o books ' to address them either to specialists (cognoscenti) in one 's ownspecialized discipline, or to nonspecialists, often students, and in thelatter case to present the material in the familiar for m of a textbook. If we look into historical practices, however, we see few instances of this kind of division of labor. Books were not written to be readonly by specialists or only by tyros, but were addressed broadly to theeducated and would-be-educated public alike. Plato, Aristotle, Aqui-4 Beyond Experience nas, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Frege, Russell, Sartre, Camus, Austin, etc., never - not one of them - ever wrote a textbook. They - all of them - wrote philosophy books, books which they intended tobe read by persons interested in philosophy, never mind whether thosereaders were professional philosophers or lay readers. The philosophytextbook is pretty much a product of the twentieth and twenty-rstcenturies. It has, however, become so entrenched in the current teach-ing of philosophy that we often forget that it is an upstart and that it ispossible - if one makes the effort and has the interest - to write phi-losophy both for one 's professional colleagues and for the interestedlay reader. At least I hope it is still possible. Of course I may bewrong. Philosophy may have become so specialized, so technical, inrecent decades that it is no longer possible to address the same bookboth to one 's professional colleagues and to the interested, educatedadult reader. I hope this is not so. The style of the bulk of the writings of Karl P pper gives one cause o for some optimism. Many of his numerous articles and the greater partof his several books are read and enjoyed both by his professionalpeers and by interested readers who are far from being professionalphilosophers. His popularity is no accident. He is, after all, a ne andimportant philosopher. But there is a signicant additional element aswell, a craftsmanship about which I heard him speak often. When I was a graduate student, I was fortunate to take a course from him. Time after time, P pper exhorted his students to try to write o so clearly that virtually anyone could understand the material. Hewar ned that if your presentation was so dense that it could be read (Iwould say \" deciphered \") only by a lear ned colleague, then you shouldgo back and rewrite it again and again until it was pellucidly clear. Hisown work, for the greatest part, really does exhibit the very virtue heurged on the rest of us. I have found his advice compelling and havetried to follow it and commend it to others. I will try here to write abook in the old-fashioned style. It is intended as an antidote to themoder n textbook. I will try to make the material accessible and com-prehensible to a wide audience. However, I will not condescend tosimplify. Quite the contrary, some sections of this book have earlierbeen published as journal articles for professional colleagues. Much - far too much, I would hazard - of recent philosophical writ- ing apes the lamentable style of contemporary articles in physics andchemistry journals. Historically, scientists did not write in the com-pressed, antiseptic, manner currently favored in the scientic journals.In centuries past, much of the humanity of scientists, their disappoint-Presenting Philosophy 5 ments, their triumphs, and their frailties, was obvious in their writings. Thus, for example, we nd Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson)positively delighting in the effect of his experiment (c. 1790) of heat-ing water by friction (emphases are Rumford 's own): At 2 hours 20 minutes it was 200 \u00b0 [F hrenheit]; and at 2 hoursa 30 minutes it AC T UA L LY BO I L E D ! It would be difcult to describe the surprise and astonish- ment expressed in the countenances of the bystanders, onseeing so large a quantity of cold water heated, and actuallymade to boil, without any re. Though there was, in fact, nothing that could justly be con- sidered as surprising in this event, yet I acknowledge fairly thatit afforded me a degree of childish pleasure, which, were Iambitious of the reputation of a grave philosopher , I ought most certainly rather to hide than to discover. ([176], 15; gloss 1added ) (W will retur n in chapter 4, to examine Rumford 's experiment ine closer detail.) T day, perhaps because of the sheer volume of scientic writings,o most articles have been reduced to a kind of formula prose whichsimply tells what was done and the results of the experiment. Onlythose scientic magazines which are expressly written for the laypublic (e.g. Scientic American and Discover ) preserve any modicum of literary worth. But as regrettable as the situation has become inscience, it is worse in philosophy. F r in philosophy there are no o magazines targeted for the public. And thus nonspecialists nd them-selves, year by year, further removed from the researches and writingsof philosophers. This unhappy state of affairs can only be to the detri-ment of both the public and philosophers themselves. Why do persons become philosophers? No one ever gets hired as a philosopher without years of preparatory training. No more so than dodoctors or lawyers. P rsons become philosophers because they are in- e tensely interested in philosophical problems. And yet so little of thisgenuinely, deeply felt interest comes across in their professional writ- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. Hereinafter, when I interpolate a gloss within a quotation I will not call explicit attention to the insertion. The square brackets alone will indicate myeditorial elaboration. Also, see footnote 1, p. x.6 Beyond Experience ings. All sense of adventure, of personality, of struggle, and, yes, on occasion, of fun, is sucked out of most that is written in philosophynowadays. Journal articles and books often are tortuously dry readingand are almost entirely in the third person, as if they had been written,not by living, breathing, feeling, human beings, but by disembodiedoracles. F r too many authors, in trying to affect a modish kind of a objectivity, end by writing a prose which is so painfully impersonalthat it reads like a technical manual for the disassembly of a carbure-tor. One can read entire philosophy books and never once nd thereinthe word \" I \" or \" you \", as if these two comfortable English wordswere somehow vile subjective dissonances. This book will be different. In the third sentence of this introduc- tory chapter, I have already used the word \" I \", as I will many, manytimes subsequently. And from time to time, I will use the word \" you \"too, remembering that I am writing this book to be read by interestedpersons, and not just to be soaked up by the silicon chips of themicrocomputer on which I happened to have typed these words. R.G. Collingwood 's aphorism \" every new generation must rewrite history in its own way \" ([51], 248) might equally well be said for phi-losophy. Not only do we each have a uniquely personal perspectivefrom which we regard our world; there is also something of a culturalperspective, and certainly, too, something of a parochial perspective,especially if - as I do - one belongs to a certain school of thought. Inmy case, I am a product of an undergraduate degree in physics and agraduate degree in Anglo-American (so-called Analytic) philosophy. Imake no apology for this mind-set: it is impossible to do philosophywithout a mind-set. One cannot transcend all mind-sets and aspire toThe Truth. That kind of Presuppositionless Objectivity is quite beyondthe capabilities of human beings. All that we can do is to be honestabout our own approach and to try to get as clear as we can about justwhat it is that we are doing. Philosophy, like so many other twenty-rst-century studies, has broadened its compass enormously. I am no polymath; I can onlyoffer my own opinions, grounded in my own particular training andperspective. This book, like every other book in philosophy, howevermuch some writers try to pretend otherwise, is a personal statement by its author. There are no authorities in philosophy. There are onlygradations of plausibility. These views explain why, then, I will try to do two things in this book. T be sure, I will devote much of what follows to exploringo some traditional problems in metaphysics; I will review a variety ofPresenting Philosophy 7 theories that other philosophers have offered as solutions; and I will on occasion criticize these theories; and I will, too, sometimes offermy own ideas as to what solutions might be. But I will try to do some-thing else as well, and this ' something else ' accounts for the \" Philo-sophical Constraints \" which gures as the second part of the subtitleof this book. I want to try to explain why philosophers disagree, why the seem- ing consensus which exists in something like, let us say, physicsseems so often unattainable in philosophy. Many newcomers - partic-ularly those used to the textbooks of public high schools, where allcontroversy and intellectual struggle have, deliberately and systemati-cally, been expunged - are dismayed at the indecisiveness of so muchof philosophy. \" All those questions; never any answers \" I have oftenheard some of my students complain. There is no disguising the fact:there is much disagreement in philosophy. But, as we shall see, thereis much - or at least there is room for as much - disagreement inphysics, chemistry, and biology, too. In chapter 4, I will argue thatphilosophy is not really any worse off in this regard than the so-calledhard sciences. The difference is that the very existence of controversyitself is one of the central concer ns of the philosophical enterprise, andthus tends to become spotlighted. But controversy is the fuel of anyand every intellectual discipline. As this book progresses, I will try toexplain the nature of philosophical controversy, or to be more exact, the aspects and parts of philosophical controversy familiar to me.Indeed, the very nature of controversy itself tur ns out to be a contro-versial topic within philosophy. Different philosophers have differentaccounts of the origins of, and the possibilities for resolving, con-troversy. And thus, to be perfectly frank, when I subsequently offermy views as to the nature of controversy - why it exists and what roleit plays in the intellectual enterprise - I will not simply be presenting asettled matter of fact, but will, by that very attempt, be engaging in apiece of philosophizing which, like all philosophy, is itself a properobject for debate and analysis. But before we begin our studies, allow me a cautionary note. Profes- sional philosophers are constitutionally incapable of succumbing tothe danger I am about to alert you to. But if you are new to philoso-phy, be careful. Philosophy ought not to be something that oneacquires like a piece of purchased material goods. Philosophy ought tobe acquired by struggling yoursel f with its problems and exploring a variety of proposed solutions looking for the ' best answer '. F r only o8 Beyond Experience in the crucible of the clash of ideas can we hope to construct good theories. If you nd yourself interested in the questions I am about to pursue and nd yourself attracted to the tentative answers I am about to offerto some of those questions, do not accept my own answers by default.The answers I proffer in this book (at least at the time of my writingthis book) seem right to me. But if you, like me, nd that these ques-tions are fascinating, then you owe it to yourself not to accept any oneperson 's answers - neither mine nor anyone else 's - until you havesavored and reflected on a variety of answers, even a variety ofapproaches. Then you can make up your own mind. In short, if it tur nsout that I have been privileged to introduce you to metaphysics and tophilosophy, and if you nd that you resonate - as some do - to thesekinds of ideas, then I urge that you let this be only the rst of manybooks you read on these subjects. F r philosophy is, in the end, an o attitude or a process of thought; it ought not to be regarded as anished product.C H A P T E R T W O The metaphysical impulse A while ago, in my introductory philosophy course, we had reached the section dealing with metaphysics. I tried to explain to my studentswhat metaphysics is by mentioning a variety of problems which tradi-tionally have been regarded as falling within that area. Among theseproblems is the nature of space and time, and I began to recount thefascination, and in some instances the bewilderment, a variety of per-sons have felt through the centuries in contemplating the concepts ofspace and time. I recounted to my students how Lucretius (Titus 1Lucretius Carus, 95-52 B C) wondered what would happen if a person were at the ' end of space ' and hurled a spear. Where would it go? Ifthere really were an edge to space, then there would have to be morespace beyond; but if there were no edge, space would have to go on' forever '. Either way - Lucretius reasoned - one could never actuallybe at the edge of space, and so Lucretius argued to the conclusion that 2space, as he put it, \" goes on and has no bounds \". ... there can be no end to anything without something beyond to mark that end 3and show where nature and sense can go no further.... if we should theorize that the wholeof space were limited, then if a man ran outto the last limits and hurled a spear,would you prefer that, whirled by might and muscle,the spear flew on and on, as it was thrown,or do you think something would stop and block it? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. The dates of most persons mentioned in this book are listed in the Names Index, pp. 427-32. 2. Later, in footnote 3, p. 151, I will say a bit more about his argument.3. I.e. sensory perception10 Beyond Experience One or the other you must assume and grant. But either cuts off escape and forces youto grant that the All goes on and has no bounds.F r whether your spear is checked and stopped by somethingo from tracing its path and landing at its goal,or flies free, where it started was not the end.So it will go: no matter where you spotthe end, I 'll ask, \" What happens to my spear? \"([127], 23-4) I recounted, too, to my students how the teenaged Martin Buber (1878-1965), twenty centuries later, in adopting the same sort of vividimagery as Lucretius 's, was driven to despair and to the brink ofinsanity. ... what stirs and terries ... the ... innity of space ... It is the fact that, by the impression of innity, anyconcept of space, a nite no less than an innite, becomes un-canny to him, for really to try and imagine nite space is just ashazardous a venture as really to try and imagine innite space,and makes man just as emphatically conscious that he is not amatch for the world. When I was about fourteen years of age Imyself experienced this in a way which has deeply influencedmy whole life. A necessity I could not understand swept overme: I had to try again and again to imagine the edge of space,or its edgelessness, time with a beginning and an end or a timewithout beginning or end, and both were equally impossible,equally hopeless - yet there seemed to be only the choicebetween the one or the other absurdity. Under an irresistiblecompulsion I reeled from one to the other, at times so closelythreatened with the danger of madness that I seriously thoughtof avoiding it by suicide. ([37], 135-6) And I told the students, too, how I myself as a youngster, knowing nothing of Lucretius or Buber, would often wonder - like countlessothers before me and doubtless countless more in the future - aboutthese same problems. Even as a child, I resolved to write a book aboutthese problems. T day, I remember only the resolve; I have totally o forgotten what I thought I might write. That forgetfulness is probablyall for the best. F r I am sure that if I could remember my childhood o ruminations on these problems, they would embarrass me by theirThe Metaphysical Impulse 11 naivety and youthful exuberance. In any event, I recounted all this to my students, and then found myself asking how many of them, too,had harbored similar wonderment and perplexity. About half the class raised their hands and we got to talking. It tur ned out, as I suspected, that many of them had wondered aboutsuch matters. But a surprise lay with the other half of the class. As wetalked, some of the latter group conded that they had never, everthought about the matter. They told us that as they looked up at thestars on cloudless nights (and that they all did, from time to time),they never found themselves wondering how big the universe was -whether nite or innite - or whether space ' went on forever ' or' stopped somewhere out there '. I am afraid that my response, afterhearing several of them profess such uninterest, was \" How can younot think about such things!? \" Two days later, in one of the tutorial groups in that same course, one of my students objected to my remark. She wrote me a note whichreads, in part: \" One of the reasons why I have failed to worry aboutsuch problems as where space ends or when did time begin is becauseI prefer to concer n myself with dilemmas that have relevance to liferight now. There are many current crises that require immediate atten-tion ... This ... point of view may make me appear ignorant of intel-lectual thought but I don 't feel comfortable worrying ... [whether] theuniverse expanded last night because whether it did or not, I can stillfunction the same as I did yesterday. \" It was clear that this woman hadbeen put on the defensive by my unfortunate manner of expression\" How can you not think about such things!? \" I say \" unfortunate \" be- cause it had certainly not been my intention to berate those who do notshare my concer n with such problems. I was not suggesting - as thisstudent thought I was - that everybody ought to be fascinated by such puzzles. Instead I was merely expressing my own surprise at, not myobjection to, other persons ' not being seduced by these problems.Once again, this time to explain the thrust of my remark, I foundmyself recounting to my students still another piece of personal his-tory. When I was in my early twenties, I dated a woman who, on our third date, happened to mention that she did not like chocolate. Myresponse on that earlier occasion had been identical, save for the lastphrase. F r I had said to her: \" How can you not like chocolate!? \" I o certainly was not nding fault with her. There is no fault in someone 'snot liking chocolate. Nor is it that I thought that she should like it orthat if she would just give herself a chance, she would lear n to like it.12 Beyond Experience Nothing of the sort. I was simply amazed that her reactions could be so dissimilar to my own. So, too, it is with metaphysics. All of us, whether trained in philosophy or not, subscribe to a great variety of metaphysical theories. Some of us, however, are predis-posed to examine these theories, to probe their strong and weakpoints, to hold them up for comparison with alter native theories, andsometimes to abandon one in favor of another. Some persons - likemyself and many, but not all, of my students - nd themselvespondering metaphysical questions without being provoked or goadedto do so. W just do it naturally. Others come to nd such problems e interesting when they nd their friends and teachers talking aboutthem. And still others nd no particular interest or reward in examin-ing the merits of the metaphysical views they hold, and grow impa-tient with the exercise of intellectual self-examination. Y u may o already know into which category you yourself fall. But for some ofyou, philosophy will come as a new challenge, and you may nd theuncovering and the analyzing of your own world-view a fascinatingroute to self-discovery. What do I mean when I say that each of us, whether professional philosopher or not, holds a great variety of metaphysical theories? Iwill try to illustrate with a few examples. The exercise will serve to 4begin to illuminate what a metaphysical theory is. Metaphysical theories infor m world-views, and by this I mean not just that they shape what we say about the world, or what we mightbelieve about the world, but that they affect our actions, our reactions,and our emotions. T this extent, they resemble religious views, but o unlike religious views, there need not be any supernatural componentto them, and unlike religious views, they invite critical scrutiny andrevision. It is surprising that metaphysical theories which may resist being judged true or false by empirical, or experiential methods, i.e. which \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. Traditionally philosophy has been regarded as having four main divisions: Metaphysics; Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge); Logic; and V lue a Theory (incorporating both Aesthetics and Ethics). But these historical parti-tions within philosophy are not immutable; they are mere conveniences.Many problems and methods, particularly in the twentieth century, crisscrossseveral of these areas. Although my concer n in this book is principally withmetaphysics, occasionally the discussion will touch upon areas customarilyregarded as lying outside of metaphysics.The Metaphysical Impulse 13 have no testable consequences, may, nonetheless, have profound practical consequences. Buber, as we have already seen, contemplated suicide because he could not see his way through a metaphysicalpuzzle. Indeed, he probably did not even realize that he had unwit-tingly subscribed to a bad (conceptually bad, not of course morallybad) metaphysical theory. His mistake, I will argue later in this book, was very basic: he conceived of space as if it were similar to familiarphysical objects, i.e. as if it were similar to the sorts of things whichhave a surface and which are located at a place. He saw his way out ofthe puzzle, nally, only by casting off the one metaphysical theory infavor of another. It is interesting to note that he was rescued by dis-covering a book of metaphysics, and thereby coming to realize that hiswas, after all, a metaphysical conundrum. Picking up the passage Iquoted just above and now continuing, we nd: Under an irresistible compulsion I reeled from one to the other, at times so closely threatened with the danger of madness that Iseriously thought of avoiding it by suicide. Salvation came tothe fteen year old boy in a book, Kant 's Prolegomena to all Future Metaphysics , which I dared to read although its rst sentence told me that it was not intended for the use of pupilsbut for future teachers. This book showed me that space andtime are only the for ms in which my human view of what is,necessarily works itself out; that is, they were not attached tothe inner nature of the world, but to the nature of my senses.([37], 136) F rtunately Buber believed he had solved the puzzle and was able too cease agonizing over it. Kant 's theory at least had the virtue of con-vincing Buber that space itself is not to be likened to objects in space.But as it tur ns out, Kant 's was not the only alter native theory thenavailable, at the end of the nineteenth century, which could havesolved Buber 's problem. There was, in fact, another theory also avail-able, one which I regard as vastly superior to Kant 's, but Buber eitherdid not know of that theory or found it less convincing. In any event,later in this book I will offer a solution to Buber 's problem modeledafter the theory, not of Kant (1724-1804), but of Leibniz, who hadflourished (1646-1716) in the century before Kant. F r a second example let us tur n from concer ns about the end ofo space to one about the end of life. One of the most troubling problemsconfronting moder n society has been the realization of the scope of,14 Beyond Experience and the devastation to families that is wrought by, Alzheimer 's dis- ease. Many an unfortunate older woman, herself suffering failinghealth and often having meager nancial means, is faced with the ter-rible burden of caring for a husband dying of Alzheimer 's disease.There can be few greater human tragedies. F r as the disease pro- o gresses the patient is able less and less to respond in a human fashion to the ministrations, the care, and the love of his own suffering wife.In the last, most horrible days of the disease, the patient is unable evento thank his benefactors, or even to recognize them, and nally unableeven to talk to them. The patient falls into what is sometimes brutally,but aptly, called \" a vegetative state \". How the wife and the family react to this unfolding tragedy is to a great extent determined by which metaphysical theory of personhoodthey subscribe to. More often than not, families are unaware that theiractions in such circumstances are infor med by anything as grand-sounding as ' a metaphysical theory ', but their actions and attitudesreally are. What, after all, is it to be a person? Is the dying, semiconscious 5patient ' really ' a person? Beliefs* differ. Some families go through their grieving process midway through the course of the illness. Atsome point, even months perhaps before the patient is pronouncedclinically dead, the family might say something of the sort, \" F ther is a gone; all that is left is the shell of his body. \" When clinical death fol-lows months later, the members of such a family experience relief, notgrief. But other families react in a totally different way. Up until themoment of clinical death they regard the patient as ' husband ' and as' father ', and will permit themselves to grieve only after the clinicaldeath. It is not just the time of grieving which differs in the two cases.There may well be resentment and anger in the latter case where thefamily has for years felt themselves obliged to cater to the bodilyneeds of the ailing patient, often at a terrible sacrice in their ownlives. The wife may be consumed with enormous guilt. After all, shepledged, and she takes her pledge seriously, to \" cleave to her husbandunto death \". But when, exactly, does a person die? Is it just a gure of speech to say - as some families do - at some point, long before the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5. T r ms having distinctive meanings within philosophy and technical ter mse which may be unfamiliar to the nonspecialist reader have been flagged ontheir rst appearance with an asterisk and are explained in the Glossary, pp.397-407.The Metaphysical Impulse 15 clinical death of the body, that an Alzheimer 's patient is dead? Which account of personhood one subscribes to can have profound effects on one 's own attitudes, on one 's sense of obligation, and onone 's own measure of self-worth when one nds oneself entrusted tocare for an Alzheimer 's patient. \" I pledged myself to care for my hus-band ' unto death '. Is this wracked body which used to be that of myhusband still my husband? Or has my husband already died, and am Ithe victim of a cruel joke of Nature, left to care for this vegetativebody as if he were still alive? Am I a wife or a widow? Is this my hus-band or merely his breathing body? I married and swore my love andcare to a person, but is this a person? How far does my obligation tocare and love go? If his body were not breathing, he would be dead.But this body is merely breathing; there is no recognition, there is nohuman response, there is nothing reciprocated. Is my husband dead? \"Few of us, mercifully, are in positions where these questions areforced on us. And thus few of us actually go through such exercises ofmulling over the alter native answers. Sometimes persons who nd themselves caring for vegetative patients are unaware (as was Buber, albeit in a very different sort ofcase) that they do subscribe to a particular metaphysical theory. Theysimply unthinkingly, unreflectingly either believe that the patient hasdied or believe that the patient has not died. They take their belieffrom their own parents, or their church, or their friends. They fail torealize that the matter is not so clear-cut, that it can be argued what theproper attitudes should be, that it cannot either be simply assumed thatthe person has died or be simply assumed that the person has not died.In short, what answers one gives to such questions, and what attitudesone takes in getting through one 's day if one is forced to care for anAlzheimer 's victim, depend on what particular metaphysical theory ofpersonhood one subscribes to. And it is remarkably easy to subscribeto one theory or another without even an inkling that one is subscrib- ing to a metaphysical theory, one which, almost certainly, many otherpersons, just as matter-of-factly, reject. But we need not be in the darkabout these remarkably different beliefs and attendant attitudes. It ispossible to become aware that our own views about what a person isconstitute a theory, not a settled ' fact ', and are thus open to examina- 6tion, to critical probing, and to revision if not outright replacement. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. Even persons who are not clinically ill can change so much as to make identity problematic. \" When [television newscaster Jessica] Savitch 's end16 Beyond Experience These two problems, the one concer ning the end of space, the other the end of life, seem at the outset to have virtually nothing in com-mon. Even the appearance of the word \" end \" in the statement of thetwo problems is more of an accident than a genuine commonality, forthe ter m is equivocal. In the rst case \" end \" means something like\" boundary \" or \" edge \", while in the latter it means \" cessation \" or\" extinction \". And yet, there is a remarkable connection between thesetwo problems. F r both problems, as we will see later, intimately concer n the con-o cept of a physical (material) body. Does space exist independently ofthe objects (material bodies), e.g. the stars, planets, and comets, whichare said to ' occupy space '? Are persons anything other than certainkinds of physical objects, viz. living human bodies? Are persons, thatis, to be identied with their bodies, or are persons conceptually dis- tinct from their bodies? The two problems, one about the nature ofspace, the other about the nature of personhood, come together inrequiring that one attend to the concept of what it is to be a physicalobject (material body). But while there is this common feature in boththese problems, certainly not all metaphysical problems share this par-ticular commonality. Still another instance where a metaphysical theory infor ms our world-view occurs in the case of our judging the proper response to aperson 's wrongdoing. Some determinists believe that punishment isnever warranted. Such persons believe that whatever a person does isdetermined by that person 's genetic makeup and environment, where\" environment \" is understood broadly to include all the stimuli which impinge on that person. But if these are all the ' determiners ' of a per- son 's behavior, and if neither your genetic makeup nor the stimuliwhich assail you are of your choosing, then there can be no sense inwhich you are responsible for your own actions. And thus someonewho subscribes to this particular theory will argue that punishment, tothe extent that it is retributive and not rehabilitative, is never morally 7justied. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 nally came in a freak car accident in 1983, one close friend had already nished mour ning: the Jessica she had once known had died years before \"([220], 63). 7. I have argued in [201], chapters 10-11, that this particular version of deter- minism assumes a certain account of the nature of physical laws, and that ifthat account is abandoned, then the conclusion that we are never responsibleThe Metaphysical Impulse 17 Can one really believe such a theory? It certainly appears that the famed trial lawyer Clarence Darrow (1857-1938) did. Every one knows that the heavenly bodies move in certain paths in relation to each other with seeming consistency andregularity which we call [physical] law. ... No one attributesfreewill or motive to the material world. Is the conduct of manor the other animals any more subject to whim or choice thanthe action of the planets? ... W know that man 's every act is e induced by motives that led or urged him here or there; that thesequence of cause and effect runs through the whole universe,and is nowhere more compelling than with man. ([53], 76-7) The principal thing to remember is that we are all the products of heredity and environment; that we have little or no control,as individuals, over ourselves, and that criminals are like therest of us in that regard. ([52], 15; quoted by permission) Darrow often used such arguments in the murder cases he defended. In the mouth of such a skillful and theatrical orator, these metaphysi-cal arguments seem to have been highly persuasive, for never once inhis long career did he lose a client to the death penalty. The impact of metaphysical theories is not reserved exclusively for such momentous issues as the extent of the universe, the nature of per-sonhood, and the existence of free will. Metaphysical theories infor mour behavior, as well, in what might be regarded as the mundane. A person who believes in souls and who believes that pain is of moral consequence only in a creature with a soul, and who believesthat animals lack souls, may believe that it is morally permissible tokill animals without trying to lessen their pain. Nowadays many of usare repelled by the idea of causing an animal needless pain. But suchattitudes have not been the historical nor m. Even nowadays many per-sons who would be appalled at someone 's inflicting injury on a dogmay not give a moment 's heed to catching a trout by means of abarbed hook in the creature 's mouth. The familiar justication for thedifference in attitude is often summed up in the formula: \" Fish arecold-blooded creatures and cold-blooded creatures do not feel pain. \" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 for our actions does not follow. I will not, however, explore these issues fur- ther in this book.18 Beyond Experience In part, but only in part, is the verdict on whether or not sh feel pain a scientic one. Science can tell us how highly developed is a sh 'scentral nervous system. What science cannot possibly tell us is to what 8extent any creature feels pain. What, if anything, makes this diverse sample of puzzles metaphysi- cal? It is important to recognize that there need be no answer to thisquestion other than tradition. There may, that is, be many metaphysi-cal problems which bear little more in common than that they areregarded as metaphysical puzzles. T this extent, \" metaphysical \" may o be like \" interesting \" or \" popular \" or \" taboo \", i.e. the ter m may de-scribe something extrinsic, a way of our regarding the thing described,rather than any intrinsic feature of the thing itself. It may well be thatthere is no way other than by giving examples to explain what is to beregarded as a metaphysical puzzle. If this is true, there should be no cause for alar m. F r if this is true, o metaphysics is no worse off in this regard than is, for example, mathe-matics. There is no single determinate feature, other than tradition,which makes some puzzle or some technique a mathematical one.When certain persons at the end of the sixteenth century set theirminds to developing what has come to be known as algebra, manymathematicians did not know what to make of the newly developingtechniques and body of knowledge ([112], 122-6). W s algebra, or a was it not, mathematics? Or, again, at the tur n of this century, as settheory was being developed at the hands of a few mathematicians, itwas being roundly condemned by others ([112], 203-4). W s set a theory a genuine part of mathematics or not? Mathematicians, withoutof course ever taking a vote on the question, but rather just by theiraccepting and using algebra and set theory, collectively decided (notdiscovered!) that these new techniques and their attendant conceptswere to be regarded as mathematical. Similarly today there is a debateamong physical anthropologists whether ' forensic archaeology ' is a 9bona de discipline alongside forensic anthropology. There is nocourt of appeal to address one 's questions to, to settle such discipli- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8. F r a taste of just some of the many problems involved in trying to under- o stand the consciousness of nonhuman creatures, see Thomas Nagel 's \" WhatIs It Like to Be a Bat? \" ([140]). 9. One anthropologist, revealing his hostility, has characterized forensic archaeologists as \" ' fringe ' elements who analyze ceramics from vandalizedsites\" (reported in [98], 2).The Metaphysical Impulse 19 nary disputes. Nowhere is it authoritatively written what is, and what is not, to count as being mathematical; nowhere is it written what is,and what is not, to count as falling within the sphere of forensicanthropology. And - to make the point I am driving at - nowhere is it,nor could it be, authoritatively written what is, and what is not, tocount as being a metaphysical problem. This is not to say, however, that anything and everything is eligible for being regarded as being a metaphysical problem. No more so thanis everything eligible for being regarded as being a mathematical or ananthropological problem. T what extent, then, can we say what a metaphysical problem is, oro put another way, what metaphysics itself is? There is no simpleanswer. The scope of metaphysics changes somewhat from generationto generation (remember the quotation [p. 6] from Collingwood,speaking of history); it may even change from philosopher to philoso-pher. I think it would be foolhardy to attempt to give anything like adenition or some formula whose application would give a verdict:\" Y s, this is a metaphysical problem \"; or, \" No, this is not a metaphys-e ical problem \". T lear n what metaphysics is, or better, what sorts of o problems philosophers regard as being metaphysical problems, oneshould look into a variety of philosophical books. And in doing that,one will quickly discover that a great many, remarkably diverse,problems are regarded as being metaphysical ones. This essential vagueness must be terribly unsatisfactory for the newcomer. There is always the expectation that one should be told atthe outset what the nature and scope is of the studies to be pursued.Actually, I have tried to anticipate this presumption with the precedingexamples. But doubtless some of you would like something more byway of characterization. So, bearing in mind the war nings I have justgiven about the hazards and indeed the futility of the attempt, let mesay just a little bit more about what metaphysics might be regarded tobe. But understand that whatever anyone could say at this point couldbe nothing more than a kind of signpost. Human beings come equipped with several sensory modes. Aris- totle (384-322 B C) thought we had exactly ve: seeing, hearing, touch- 10ing, tasting, and smelling. So venerated was his philosophy that this \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. See [10], book III, 424b20-3. Aristotle not only thought that there were exactly ve senses, he thought that it was provable that there could not beany more than ve (see 424b24-425a14).20 Beyond Experience wildly wrong opinion was, and still is, accepted by many persons as indubitable truth. But the simple fact is that human beings have morethan ve senses, and I am not talking about esoteric senses whose veryexistence is highly debatable, such as precognition, clairvoyance, ortelekinesis. I mean perfectly ordinary, common, garden-variety senses:of temperature, of balance, of pain, etc. Our senses serve up to us a rich variety of infor mation about the world external to our skins and internal to our skins. But our curiosityruns beyond our ability to probe the universe with the sensory toolswe are bor n with. W extend, and indeed supplement, our human e senses with artfully crafted scientic instruments. Our scientic in-struments extend the range of our senses, to the infrared, to the ultra-violet, and beyond; to the subaudible, to the cryogenic, to the micro-scopic, etc. Our instruments, too, can make discriminations much nerthan we ourselves are personally capable of: the nanosecond, themicron, the milligram, etc. And our instruments can even revealfeatures of Nature to which our senses seem to be blind, such as thepolarization of the sky, the magnetic eld of the Earth, or the directionof an electrical current. Such knowledge, as provided by our sensesand by the extension of those senses through the use of scienticinstruments, is considered to be experiential knowledge. Only a little of experiential knowledge is passive. The greatest part is the result of our (individually and collectively) actively examiningand manipulating the environment with an eye to gaining knowledge.Our creative talents are pressed to the limits in this enterprise andreach their greatest fruition in our creating science. Few of the work-ings of Nature are written on the surface, as it were. T understand o how the world operates we need to guess about its workings, to testthose guesses, and then to guess again and again when those guessestur n out to be incorrect. P pper has called the method of science \" con- o jectures and refutations \". Just as aptly it could be called \" a creativeguessing game \". The growth in experiential knowledge has been prodigious in extent and remarkable in its variety. Science has revealed to us many of thenearly innitesimal components of the atom and much of the struc-tures of galactic clusters; many of the secrets of inorganic matter andthose of living tissues; a considerable number of the operations of theinsensate, and some of the innitely more subtle operations of the con-sciousnesses of human beings. What is there about hydrogen and oxygen that allows them to for m a molecule? What is there about these same elements which preventsThe Metaphysical Impulse 21 each of them from for ming molecules with seven of their own kind, i.e. why are there no molecules consisting solely of eight atoms ofhydrogen, and none consisting solely of eight atoms of oxygen? Whatis the normal evolution of stars? How are genes replicated? How domuscles contract? These are the sorts of questions which science cananswer. Nonetheless, experiential knowledge, whether the product of pas- sive, unaided human sensory perception or the result of the mosthighly imaginative and sophisticated scientic hypothesizing com-bined with controlled experimenting with technically rened instru-ments, still can take us only so far. Our desire for explanations forevertranscends what experience, even when pushed to its limits in science,can possibly offer us. Experience cannot answer a question such as\" What must a world be like in order that there should be able to existwithin it such things as physical molecules? \" Experience cannot tellus, for example, whether a human being, in the nal stages of Alzhei-mer 's disease, who has lost all ability to recognize and interact withother human beings, is still a person. Experience cannot tell us, forexample, whether a (future) computer which perfectly imitates thebehavior of a human being is conscious. Experience cannot tell us, forexample, whether human beings have free will. And experience can-not tell us whether human beings have immortal, immaterial souls. These questions, which go beyond the ability of experience, beyond the ability of science, to answer, are metaphysical questions. This, atthe very least, is the one common thread in all metaphysical questions.Etymology is not always a good indicator of meaning, but in this 11instance \" meta \", meaning \" beyond \", is apt. Metaphysical questionsare questions whose answers lie \" beyond \" physics, i.e. beyond sci-ence, beyond experience. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 11. W want to be careful, however, not to carry the etymology back too far. e F r although the etymology does provide a useful insight, it tur ns out to beo more fortuitous than it might at rst appear. There were neither quotationmarks nor italics in ancient Greek. Andronicus of Rhodes (c. 70 B C) intro- duced the ter m \" metaphysics \" in editing Aristotle 's writings. At its rstappearance, \" metaphysics \" meant, not \" beyond physics \", but \" after Physics \"; that is, Andronicus used the expression to refer to Aristotle 's sequel tothe treatise Physics. It was only subsequently that the ter m \" metaphysics \" came to be understood, not as indicating the position of certain of Aristotle 'swritings within his corpus, but rather as the kind of material treated in thosewritings. (See [54], 1.)22 Beyond Experience It does not follow, of course, that the converse is true, that every question which lies beyond the abilities of experience to answer is tobe regarded as a metaphysical one. Quite the contrary, many suchquestions are traditionally thought not to be metaphysical ones at all.Questions of ethics and of aesthetics, for example, if their answersreally do lie outside of experience, are not usually thought of as beingpart of metaphysics. So what we nd is that the best we can do is to characterize meta- physical problems as being among those problems whose answers take us beyond experience. But what makes one problem in this latterclass a metaphysical problem and another a non-metaphysical problemis probably something that, ultimately, can be decided only by exam-ining the history of philosophy to nd the verdict of tradition. Metaphysics can be pursued on a grand scale or it can be narrowly focused on one or a few specic problems. When Bruce Wilshire, forexample, begins his book on metaphysics by writing \" Metaphysicsseeks a comprehensive view of the world \" ([215], 13), he clearly istalking of metaphysics conceived in the for mer manner. And what hetries to do is to explore the rise and fall of a number of historicalattempts at creating large-scale metaphysical theories. Metaphysicsneed not be pursued in that fashion, however. One need not try tosolve every metaphysical problem simultaneously by the proposing ofa comprehensive theory. One can choose to work piecemeal, by solv-ing, or at least elucidating, specic metaphysical problems. Thus, forexample, in this century we have seen a number of books, by a greatvariety of philosophers, devoted to single problems within meta-physics, e.g. on the nature of mind, on the analysis of causality, on theanalysis of free will, on the relations between particulars and univer-sals, and on the nature of space and time. Philosophers who choose topursue metaphysics in this latter fashion may have no overarchingscheme which infor ms their researches. A philosopher choosing toanalyze, for example, the possibility of the existence of free will may,but certainly need not, have a philosophical theory about the nature ofspace and time. This book is of the latter design. I examine in subsequent pages only a select number of metaphysical problems. My criterion forchoosing is very straightforward: these are the problems which haveinterested me most in recent years. Utterly no value judgment isintended about the relative merits of the greater part of metaphysicswhich is not pursued in this book. I am temperamentally disinclined tothe kind of grand system building which has attracted some philoso-The Metaphysical Impulse 23 phers. I am also somewhat pessimistic about the prospects for success if one endeavors to create a comprehensive system. The probability oferror increases with the magnitude of the task. Grand system buildingis vastly more risky than focusing on specic problems. Indeed, thelatter is quite difcult enough for me. In contrast to Wilshire 's opening sentence, which foreshadows an examination of large-scale metaphysical schemes, the opening sen-tence of P.F. Strawson 's book lays the groundwork for his pursuingmetaphysics in a more modest fashion: \" Metaphysics has been oftenrevisionary, and less often descriptive \" ([200], 9). Strawson explainsthe difference this way: Descriptive metaphysics is content to describe the actual struc- ture of our thought about the world, revisionary metaphysics isconcer ned to produce a better structure. ... P rhaps no actual e metaphysician has ever been, both in intention and effect,wholly the one thing or the other. ... This book is, in part, andin a modest way, an essay in descriptive metaphysics. Only in amodest way - for though some of the themes discussed aresufciently general, the discussion is undertaken from a certainlimited viewpoint and is by no means comprehensive. ([200], 9,11) It should be clear, from what I have already said, that this book, like Strawson 's, is one intended by its author to be \" undertaken from acertain limited viewpoint and is by no means comprehensive. \" Myaim is to try to lay bare the ' inner logic ' (if I may be permitted such aphrase) of some of our most fundamental concepts. But - as Strawsonexplains - descriptive metaphysics is virtually always accompanied byrevisionary metaphysics. And thus I usually will not be content simplyto say, \" This is the way such-and-such a concept is standardly used. \"Frequently, I will venture to say something bolder, to wit, somethingtantamount to \" This is the way such-and-such a concept ought to be understood. \" When I do that, I will not merely be reporting how theconcept is used; I will be suggesting how we might protably reviseor rene our concept for further use.C H A P T E R T H R E E Theories: What they are andwhat they are not In chapter 2, I invoked the concept of theory several times. In chapters 4 and 5, I will discuss what differences there are between meta-physical theories and scientic theories and what the problems are ingenerating and testing theories. But we will pause here to examine theconcept of theory itself. A theory is, in the broadest sense, one or more hypotheses about some particular subject matter, such as mechanics, optics, inter nationaltrade, disease transmission, lear ning, pest control, ethics, innite num-bers, or sexual maturation. A theory is, in brief, an attempt to come togrips with, to make sense of, to explain, and in some instances to con-trol and predict, something of particular interest to us, often some fea-ture of the world (children 's growth, climatic changes, audio repro-duction, etc.), but sometimes something as ' abstract ' as provability orexistence in mathematics. On this account, we all construct theories constantly. Some of them may be relatively long-lived; for example, you might theorizethat investing one-tenth of your net income in gover nment bonds isthe best manner to save for your retirement and might subscribe to thistheory and put it into practice (follow its precepts) for all of yourworking lifetime. Other theories might be rejected almost im-mediately; for instance, the theory that the noise in a distant part ofyour friend 's apartment was caused by someone 's knocking on a win-dow. It may happen that no sooner does this theory cross your mindthan it might immediately be discarded, particularly if you happen torecall that you are visiting in an apartment on the forty-second floor. It might strike you as rather overstated, even a bit pretentious, to call a momentarily entertained belief that someone is knocking on thewindow a \" theory \". Y u may nd that you want to reserve the ter m o \" theory \" for something somewhat more elaborate, more specialized -Theories 25 for example, a theory about chemical reactions, or immunization, or electromagnetic radiation. Y u might, that is, be inclined to reserve the o ter m \" theory \" exclusively for recognizably scientic contexts. But there is no particular need to be difdent about conceiving of commonplace, even momentary, beliefs - e.g. about the cause of anoise in an apartment - as theories. Scientists have no more proprie-tary claim to \" theory \" than they have to ter ms like \" experiment \", oreconomists have to ter ms like \" prot \". T be sure, there is, for ex- o ample, a specialized sense of \" prot \" which economists adopt in their economic writings, but that sense is certainly not the only viablesense. W can, and do, for example, talk about the prot, not monetary e or capital gain certainly, in reading a good book, or taking a vacation,or quitting smoking. There unquestionably is this more general notionof \" prot \" having to do with gaining a good of any sort. So too isthere a notion of \" experiment \" which includes, but is not restricted to,the kinds of deliberately crafted laboratory experiments conducted byscientists. The four-year-old child, in rubbing one crayon over a markmade by another crayon, is experimenting with colors and textures; a chef substituting one spice for another specied in a recipe is ex- perimenting with flavors; and so on. And so it is with the ter m \" theory \". Theorizing is not something conned to the scientic con-text, nor is it the sole preserve of the trained scientist. All of ustheorize. W theorize about the cause of the delay in the mail, the best e way to handle the grievance from the shop steward, whether there isan afterlife, how to avoid having to buy a new vacuum cleaner,whether it would be protable to search the house for our missingnotes for the report we are writing or whether to assume that they areforever lost and it would be best to try to reconstruct them, etc. (Y u may recall, a moment ago, at the very end of chapter 2, Io wrote: \" Frequently, I will venture to say something bolder, to wit,something tantamount to, ' This is the way such-and-such a conceptought to be understood. ' When I do that, I will not merely be report- ing how the concept is used; I will be suggesting how we mightprotably revise or rene our concept for further use. \" Notice that thisis precisely what I have just been doing, in discussing how the conceptof theory is to be understood, and I will continue to do so throughout the rest of this current chapter. I am not merely saying that such-and-such is the way the concept theory is used; I have been arguing, and will continue to argue, that to adopt a certain usage is useful andprotable. In short, I am not just engaging in a piece of descriptive26 Beyond Experience 1lexicography,* but I am here doing philosophy, in this particular case, recommending how we might best, or at least usefully, regardthe concept of theory. I have, that is, started upon a philosophical theory about, interestingly enough, the very concept of theory itself. Hereinafter, however, as I continue this sort of exercise for a varietyof other concepts, I will not again explicitly direct your attention tothe fact that I am not only reporting how a concept is ordinarily used,but also, and more importantly for my purposes, making a proposalhow I think it might better be used. Concepts, after all, are intellectualtools. W are not duty-bound to leave them as we nd them. W areee entitled to tamper with them, to experiment with them, in an effort totry to improve them. And having wrought modications in a concept,we are entitled to offer those changes to others, along with our reasonsfor the revisions and with samples of their uses, so that others mayhave grounds for accepting, rejecting, criticizing, or modifying ourhandiwork in tur n.) Some authors like to make a distinction between hypotheses on the one hand and theories on the other. The distinction is akin to that be-tween sentences and paragraphs: a paragraph may consist of a singlesentence, but it may also consist of a great many sentences groupedtogether by a common subject matter. Similarly, a theory may con-sist of a single hypothesis, but it may also consist of a great manyhypotheses grouped together by a common subject matter. Becausetheories are, in the end, collections of one or more hypotheses, I willnot usually distinguish between the two. I am as happy to talk abouthypotheses as I am about theories. A theory, on this account, is a guess, sometimes a remarkably in- sightful guess, sometimes one containing several propositions*, but aguess, hypothesis, or conjecture nonetheless. I use all these ter ms,\" guess \", \" conjecture \", and \" hypothesis \", almost interchangeably. Theonly difference is that while all hypotheses are guesses, not all guessesare hypotheses. A child may hide a jelly bean in one of her sts andask her brother, \" Which one? \" If the brother tries, using his knowl-edge of his sister 's typical behavior, to gure out in which hand she islikely to have concealed the candy, then he is constructing a hypothe-sis. But if he chooses at random, makes a stab in the dark as we say,he is merely guessing, not hypothesizing. The difference is that ahypothesis is something more, but often little more, than just a guess. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. See \" descriptive denition \" in Glossary.Theories 27 It is an attempt to make sense of, or to predict the truth of some fea- ture of the world by calling upon one 's prior knowledge of the worldand some rational grounds for expecting it to be of one sort rather thananother. But with this said, I will not trouble myself further withtrying to offer a decisive account of the difference. Guesses andhypotheses are similar enough to one another that - for present pur-poses - a precise account of their subtle differences is not required. Some theories - e.g. that someone is knocking on the window - may be regarded to be among those things which may be judged trueor false. But other theories do not lend themselves to being judgedtrue or false - e.g. the theory (next chapter) that we should prefer ex-planations of natural events in ter ms of causes rather than in ter ms ofpurposes. These latter sorts of theories must be judged on othercriteria; for instance, Is the adopting of the theory useful? Does itallow us to get on better than do alter native theories? Is it simpler thanalter native theories? W will retur n to the matter of appraising such e theories later, in chapter 6, where we will examine metaphysical theo-ries in greater detail. Theories of the sort which allow for being judged true or false do not cease to be theories when their truth or falsity becomes known. Atheory - just like a guess - may be true; equally well a theory may befalse. This is not to say of course that any one theory may be both trueand false. I mean simply that something 's being a theory does notpreclude its being true: it may be, or then again, it may not be. Andthus a theory does not cease to be a theory when its truth comes to beregarded as a virtual certainty. Geometrical optics is sometimes heldup as an example of a body of knowledge whose truth is a practicalcertainty and whose details have been agreed upon, virtually withoutchange, for more than one hundred years. But despite its durability, itis still appropriate, within the meaning of the ter m, to call geometricaloptics a \" theory \". So, too, is it appropriate to talk of the theory that poliomyelitis is caused by a virus. This latter claim is, so far as Iknow, universally assented to within the medical profession. But it isstill perfectly appropriate to call the claim a theory. I emphasize the point that a theory may be true, that this is no con- tradiction in ter ms, because there is a bogus, quasi-political, argumentto the contrary which we would do well to scotch. Some creationists have argued that Creation Science deserves to be taught in the public schools alongside evolutionary theory, becauseboth are conjectures and neither can be regarded as established fact.The flawed argument runs like this: \" The very name ' evolutionary28 Beyond Experience theory ' signies that the claims being made are not proven. Whatever is proven is called a ' fact ', not a ' theory '. Evolutionary theory is not proven. It is conjecture; it is a set of beliefs. But insofar as evolution-ary theory is just that, a theory, i.e. unproven, then so too does crea-tion theory, admittedly also not proven, deserve to be taught alongsideas an alter native viewpoint. \" The creationist has in this argumentmade heavy weather of the word \" theory \", stating explicitly that theter m implies \" not proven \". This is simply incorrect. It is perfectlyproper to regard a body of propositions which have a certain explana-tory power, and which are generally regarded as true, as a \" theory \".Witness: the special theory of relativity, today so well established thatit is not much challenged; the theory of conic sections, believed bymost, if not all, mathematicians to be absolutely correct and notprotably to be challenged; and the theory of logarithms. All of theseare theories, and all of them - just like the previously mentionedtheories of poliomyelitis and geometrical optics - are reasonably to be 2regarded as true. If espousers of Creation Science, then, want to makea case for the teaching of Creation Science in the public schools, theymust do so on grounds other than the claim that evolution and creationare both theories. F r, from the fact that something is a theory, noth- o ing whatsoever follows about its worthiness, or unworthiness, to betaught in the public schools. Whether Creation Science deserves to betaught depends, rather, on what kind of theory it is: for example, whether it is religious or scientic, whether it is amenable or immuneto revision, and whether it is strongly or weakly conr med* by theevidence offered in its support. Theories which are true or false are called \" truth-valued theories \". (Being \" truth-valued \" simply means being \" either true or false \".)Among truth-valued theories, just as some may, with virtual certainty(conviction), be regarded as being true, others may, with equal cer-tainty, be regarded as being false; e.g. the theory that flies sponta-neously generate from putrefying meat; the theory that human beingsare the only tool-making animals on this planet; and the theory that itis possible to construct a perpetual-motion machine. But most truth-valued theories fall somewhere between the two extremes, some closeto one end or the other, while other theories fall closer to the middle. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. The list goes on indenitely: e.g. the theory that light travels at a xed, nite velocity; the theory that blood circulates within the human body; or thetheory that genetic infor mation is coded in the DNA molecule.Theories 29 This is not, of course, to say that truth-valued theories fall along a continuum from true to false. There is nothing ' between ' truth and fal-sity. Any truth-valued theory is either true or it is false; there is noother alter native. There is, however, a continuum between our attitudeof resolute conviction on the one extreme and our attitude of total dis-belief on the other. W may well be strongly inclined to view some e particular theory as true, another theory as false, and still another asone whose truth or falsity we are unsure about. Thus it is possible, al-though relatively rare, to be badly mistaken about a theory 's truth. Wemight, for example, take a false theory to be indubitable, even though- in this case - we happen to have made a mistake, and the theory is,in fact, false. As human beings, wanting to get on in the world, wemust make reasoned judgments about the truth or falsity, or the utilityas the case may be, of many of our theories. W may, even, feel our- e selves justied in adopting an attitude of certainty about particularones among our truth-valued theories. On occasion, however, theworld fools us; on occasion, the world surprises us. What we are con-vinced is true sometimes tur ns out - for all that - to be false; and whatwe are convinced is false sometimes tur ns out - for all that - to betrue. In the previous chapter I mentioned that many persons hold to a variety of theories without even being aware that they do so. I think,in fact, that we each hold not to just a few such theories, but to a greatmany. These theories typically are not especially well-articulated.Indeed, I am sure that most of the theories each of us subscribes to areheld rather inchoately, below the level of conscious examination. Notonly are we often not aware that we hold them, we would have somedifculty in articulating them were we to try. The case is analogous toa person 's knowing the meaning of a word, but without being able togive a denition of that word. This is especially true of children.Children know, that is, are able to use correctly, a great many words.But they are not able to dene those words or tell you what thosewords mean. Being able to use a word and being self-consciouslyaware of the meaning of the word are two quite different skills. Thelatter comes only later in one 's intellectual development, if it comes atall. Similarly for theories. Each of us subscribes to an enormous num-ber of theories but we may be totally unaware that we do, and may beunable to articulate many of the theories we in fact believe and actupon. Theorizing begins at a very early age. Even as the young infant lies in her crib, she begins exploring her environment and theorizing30 Beyond Experience about it. Laboratory data suggest that it takes some weeks before the infant ' catches on ' to the fact that when objects pass out of view (e.g.Mother or F ther leaving the room) or one object passes behind a another object, the obscured object does not ' go out of existence '([115], 451-3). But what exactly do we mean when we say that the in-fant ' catches on ' to the fact that most material objects persist (con-tinue to exist) even though obscured from view by some other physi-cal object? The most natural way to explicate this notion of ' catchingon ' is to say of the infant that she has posited* the hypothesis (con-structed the theory) that obscured physical objects continue to exist,and that, by experimenting, has come to accept this hypothesis. Note,of course, that we are not saying that the infant has a concept ofhypothesis or of theory. One may create a theory without having the concept of a theory, just as one may walk or talk without having theconcept walking or the concept talking. And it bears remarking, too, that some theorizing at least - for example, this very case of the younginfant hypothesizing the persistence of obscured physical objects -can proceed without a language. Indeed animals which lack languagescan also be regarded as engaging in theorizing, although at a muchless sophisticated level than human beings. Just as animals, e.g. catsand dogs, can be regarded as having certain kinds of unsophisticatedbeliefs, they can as well be regarded as engaging in a kind of low- 3level, unsophisticated, theorizing. In the eighteenth century, Kant hypothesized (recall the second quotation from Buber in chapter 2, p. 13) that the human mind is soconstituted as to interpret the data of our senses in such a way that theexternal world would present itself to our consciousness so as to beperfectly describable by Euclidean geometry. If someone were to tryto salvage this theory, and render it in a more moder n idiom, it wouldprobably emerge as the theory that our brains are hard-wired (prepro-grammed) to apply a Euclidean computation to the data provided by \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. These sorts of claims - about beliefs and theories held by animals - are programmatic. At the current level of theory within psycholinguistics, we areunable to state very precisely just what it is for an animal to have a belief. Asa matter of fact, we are unable to state with much clarity and conviction whatit is for a human being to have a belief. In a way, the claims that animals canhave beliefs and can engage in theorizing are pre-theoretical. They constitute,not the results of well-conr med theories in psycholinguistics, but rathersome of the intuitively grasped data which we would like to see such theories, in due course of their development, accommodate.Theories 31 our sensory organs. Moder n engineers use the technical ter m \" lter \" to describe any ' black-box device ' which alters, in a determinate man-ner, signals infor mation passing through that device ([102], 352).Thus polarizers placed on a camera lens are lters, but so too are bassand treble controls on a stereo amplier, and so too are many com-puter programs, e.g. ones which chop text les into readable chunks oftwenty-ve lines, or which justify lines of text so that they are all ofunifor m width on a page. In moder n terminology, then, Kant 's theorywas that the mind acts as a lter on the raw data of sense to transfor mthem in such a way as to confor m to the calculus of Euclideangeometry, or to put it still another way, the mind is itself a Euclideanlter. Now this particular claim, both in its original for m and in itsmoder n transfor mation, is probably false. W probably are not e preprogrammed to view the world with the kind of specicity inherentin Euclidean geometry. W may not, that is, be preprogrammed to in- e terpret the world so that, for example, doubling the lengths of thesides of a triangle would leave all the angles unchanged. (This latter isa theorem of Euclidean geometry, but not of some other geometries.)But we may be preprogrammed to interpret the world in more general ways, e.g. to conceive of it as having movable, enduring, physical ob-jects; or to conceive of it as having objects at varying distances fromour personal loci of perception. Since the early-twentieth century, someexperimental psychologists and linguists have tur ned to examine thesesorts of questions empirically: What sorts of beliefs, if any, do weseem predisposed to adopt? What sorts of concepts, if any, do weseem naturally to use? Some of the pioneering work in this eld, in particular Piaget 's in- vestigations into children 's understanding of the concept of causality , remains among the most interesting and philosophically illuminating([152]). His experimental data showed that children take several yearsto develop anything like an adult 's understanding, and use, of the con- 4cept of causality . P rhaps this very fact that it takes children so longe to master the concept of causality may help to explain why philos- ophers have had such a difcult time in trying to explicate it. Theconcept of causality may take so long to acquire because it is so com- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. Some more recent research (see [96], 2-3) would tend to lower, somewhat, the ages Piaget found for the various stages of mastery of the concept ofcausality. Nonetheless, his original nding that it takes children several years to acquire the adult 's understanding of the concept remains intact.32 Beyond Experience plicated and multifaceted, and indeed probably is not one single con- cept, but rather a family of concepts. It should be clear, from the examples I have been giving, that theories need not be (sets of ) mathematical formulas. Certain philoso-phers, however, in trying to explicate the concept of a theory, havefocused their attention on the sorts of theories one nds in physics andchemistry. F r example, Er nest Nagel, taking his inspiration from o Norman Campbell (1880-1949), writes: F r the purposes of analysis, it will be useful to distinguisho three components in a theory: (1) an abstract calculus that is thelogical skeleton of the explanatory system, and that \" implicitlydenes \" the basic notions of the system; (2) a set of rules thatin effect assign an empirical content to the abstract calculus byrelating it to the concrete materials of observation and experi-ment; and (3) an interpretation or model for the abstract cal- 5culus, which supplies some flesh for the skeletal structure inter ms of more or less familiar conceptual or visualizablematerials. ... However [these distinctions] ... are rarely givenexplicit formulation in actual scientic practice, nor do theycorrespond to actual stages in the construction of theoretical ex-planations. ([139], 90) By an \" abstract calculus \", Nagel means a mathematical equation or a statement expressed using the symbolism of moder n mathematicsor logic, e.g. (3.1) F = ma (3.2) I = E / R 22(3.3) Z = [R + (X - X ) ]L C Such symbolic expressions are, in the rst instance, to be conceived only as formulas which may be manipulated by the rules of somesystem. The \" F \", the \" m \", the \" a \", etc. are to be regarded merely as variables, in much the same way that a high-school teacher may \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5. The metaphor, \" skeleton \" and \" flesh \", which Nagel adopts here is not just his own: it is a familiar one which dozens of other philosophers of sciencehave appropriated as well.Theories 33 instruct students to manipulate expressions in algebra, such as 2\" x + 11 = 29.49 \", without specifying whether the variables are to stand for dollars, acres of far mland, milliliters of sulfuric acid, orscores on tests of eye blink frequencies. Only at the second stage ismeaning to be assigned to the symbols, e.g. \" F \" may be said to stand for \" force \", \" m \" for \" mass \", and \" a \" for acceleration, so that a for- mula such as (3.1) above might then be read as expressing Newton 'ssecond law of motion. Similarly, under the proper interpretation of\" I \", \" E \", and \" R \", (3.2) above may be read as expressing Ohm 's law, and under a proper denition for \" Z \", \" R \", \" X \", and \" X \", (3.3) LC above may be read as expressing the formula for calculating the im- pedance of a resistor-capacitance-inductor circuit. T be fair, Nagel explicitly denies that this philosophical recon-o struction which he is offering is meant to portray precisely what youmight expect to nd in physics texts and journals, nor is it meant tocapture the \" actual stages in the construction of theoretical explana-tions \". Nagel 's explication, which is promoted by a great number ofother philosophers of science as well, is intended to reveal no moreand no less than the ' logical structure ' of scientic theories. Philosophical ' reconstruction ' is a peculiar business. Even among philosophers who nominally belong to the same school of philosophy,there are remarkably different opinions as to what, properly, ought to 6go into a philosophical reconstruction. Nagel, in this passage, hasallied himself with the so-called formalist branch of Analytic philoso-phy. The formalist approach may be contrasted with the contextualist 7(or ordinary-language ) approach. The differences between these twoapproaches were more clear-cut and topical in the 1950s than they arecurrently, but something of the attitudes each wing took toward philos-ophy still characterizes many contemporary philosophers. Although \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. Incidentally, there are a few well-known, widely read, philosophers all bearing the name \" Nagel \". I am here writing of Er nest Nagel. 7. Neither \" contextualist \" nor \" ordinary-language \" are particularly good de- scriptions of the analytic philosophers who are not formalists. A more apt,but even less explanatory, description would be simply \" non-formalist \". V ry e crudely, the non-formalists put more stock into trying to incorporate into theiranalyses of concepts something of the context-dependency of their uses andthe intentions of their users, i.e. what are often called the ' pragmatics ' of theiruse.34 Beyond Experience not pledging unreserved allegiance to either wing, many contemporary philosophers tend to identify more strongly with one approach thanwith the other. On the matter of explicating the concept of theory, I depart widely from the formalists. T focus exclusively, or even primarily, on the o mathematical and logical features of certain rened theories in phys-ics, chemistry, and economics strikes me as drawing too restricted asample and ignoring too many other critical features. Of course sometheories are highly mathematical (quantum theory, special and generalrelativity, string theory [in cosmology], etc.), but this must not causeus to overlook that the greatest number of our theories are not mathe- matical ones. W will fail to understand what role theories - both e scientic and metaphysical ones - play in our lives if we blinker ouranalysis by conceiving of theory overly narrowly. Theorizing per- meates our human approach to the world. It is not something reservedexclusively for the accomplished, trained scientist. All of us theorizeconstantly, on political matters, human relationships, humankind 'splace in the world, children, ear ning a living, friendship, loyalty,death, etc. Philosophers differ, too, as to whether, and how much, a philo- sophical analysis ought to try to capture the route or means by which aconcept is acquired. F rmalists will usually dismiss the matter of con- o cept- and theory-generating as ' psychologizing ', arguing that it has noproper place in the concer ns of philosophy. Again others, I amongthem, take the opposite point of view. Pick up any textbook which attempts to teach a person physics or chemistry. The actual mathematical formulas typically will compriseno more than 5% of the total text, in some books vastly less, perhapsno more than 1%. Attend some introductory classes in any science, whether physics, chemistry, economics, sociology, or anthropology.There you will hear the lecturer speaking almost entirely in English orsome other natural language. Usually the lecturer will write down themathematical parts of the lecture on the blackboard, and students willcopy that math into their notebooks. An outsider, looking at thoseclass notes, might easily mistakenly infer that the lecture was almostentirely in mathematics. But this is clearly not so. T teach a theory, to o explain it to other persons, to get those other persons to understand thetheory - so that they in tur n can use it, can apply it to the world in anattempt to understand, manage, and predict what is going on in theworld - one must communicate in a natural language. W never lear ne theories by rst being taught an uninterpreted calculus, and then,Theories 35 having mastered the manipulation of the symbols, by being infor med, at a second stage of initiation as it were, what those symbols refer to.No, teachers rst try to explain to their students what the concepts of(for instance) mass, prot, capital, velocity, and neurosis are, and then and only then do they proceed to introduce symbols for those con-cepts. T understand why the formalists nd the sort of analysis offeredo by Nagel both alluring and plausible, one must understand that thissort of analysis has had some very striking historical successes. It is,to my mind, still the best account available to explain how it is pos-sible that there can be alter native geometries. F r two thousand years, o from the time of Euclid to the mid-nineteenth century, there had beenbut one geometry: Euclid 's. The prevailing view as to why there wasexactly one geometry was to the effect that, in some sense, eitherbecause geometry was a logical necessity or because geometry wasimposed by the mind on the data of sense (Kant), there could not be any more than one. When, nally, several geometries were discovered(invented) which competed with Euclidean geometry, an explanationhad to be found. The sort of analysis offered by Nagel and other for-malists serves that purpose admirably. By conceiving of each andevery geometry as, in the rst instance, consisting of just a set of unin-terpreted formulas, the way was found to place them all on an equalfooting. All geometries are simply abstract, uninterpreted calculisaying nothing whatsoever about the real world, and thus none ofthem is either true or false. Only when an uninterpreted system is' fleshed out ' with an interpretation, for example, linking the uninter-preted ter m \" L \" with something in the actual world that is to count as a line, can the interpreted geometry thereby created then be tested fortruth or falsity. Thus the model Nagel presents is powerfully historically motivated. It has had some stunning success. And indeed I continue to use itregularly to explain to my own students how it is possible that thereare bona de alter native, non-Euclidean, geometries. But the questionremains as to how far this particular formal analysis of theory may be extended. And it is in answering this question that some of the mostfundamental differences in philosophical attitude become vocally con-tested among analytic philosophers. Plato is reputed to have had inscribed in the lintel of the entrance to his Academy the motto \" Let no one who is not a geometer enter. \"The slogan had a point. Plato looked upon geometry as the ' ideal ' ofknowledge. It was the ' most perfect ' for m of knowledge. Non-geo-36 Beyond Experience metrical propositions were regarded as approximating to knowledge to the degree that they exhibited the rigor and style of geometry. T be sure, there is something quite remarkable, audacious, eveno aesthetically pleasing, that is to say, beautiful, in geometry. It is a mar-vel of the powers of human reason. But to what extent any given mas-terpiece, whether a geometry, a musical composition, or an act ofbravery, ought to set the standards by which others of that genre are tobe judged remains an issue over which all of us, philosophers andnon-philosophers alike, will perennially argue. Nagel and other formalists tend to offer specic, idealized , reconstructions of many of our most fundamental concepts - e.g. of 8theory, of cause, of explanation , indeed even of space and of time - growing out of analyses of some especially favored particular cases.Carl Hempel, for example, in explicating the concepts of theory, cause, and explanation ([90]), invoked the case of a car 's radiator cracking when the temperature fell below freezing - a case lending it-self to prediction by citing antecedent conditions (drop in temperature,lack of antifreeze, etc.) and known scientic laws (concer ning theexpansion of water when frozen, the tensile strength of metals, etc.). Non-formalists are temperamentally disposed to cast their nets far wider, to collect a much greater diversity of cases from which to beginand then to try to accommodate as much as possible of this diversityin their analyses. Critics of the formalist approach will argue, forexample, against the appropriateness of Hempel 's favored example,objecting that it is an articially simple case, unrepresentative of casessuch as explaining someone 's purchasing theater tickets in anticipa-tion of surprising arriving guests. In the latter case, of humanbehavior, there is little expectation of our being able to predict thepurchase nor can we deduce the description of the event from antece-dent conditions and known scientic laws. Wittgenstein (1889-1951),although himself having once been a formalist, denigrated the for-malists ' approach when he wrote in his posthumous Philosophical Investigations : \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8. It is a fascinating, and eye-opening, investigation to compare the writings of a formalist on the topic of time (see e.g. Gr \u00a8 nbaum [84]) with those of u sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists (see e.g. Gurvitch [85]).Sometimes it is difcult to discer n in just what sense these persons are writ-ing about the ' same ' thing.Theories 37 ... in many cases where the question arises \" Is this an appropri- ate description or not? \" The answer is: \" Y s, it is appropriate, e but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for thewhole of what you are claiming to describe. \" ([216], \u00a73) A main cause of philosophical disease - a one-sided diet: one nourishes one 's thinking with only one kind of example. (\u00a7593) It would be tempting to ask, \" W ll, who is right, the formalists or their e critics? Which is the correct way to go about doing a philosophicalanalysis? \" If only such questions had straightforward answers. But they do not. I can see no way at all to offer an answer without begging* thevery question being posed. F rmalists will answer in one fashion, o non-formalists in another. But who, or where, is the neutral, objectivereferee who can adjudicate the debate? So far as I can tell, at thispoint, when we have begun to ask questions about how philosophy isto be done, there can be no denitive or authoritative answers. As Isaid earlier, each of you must sample philosophical approaches to ndone suitable for yourself. At some point argumentation comes to anend and it becomes time simply to choose. When I was much younger, I did not at all have this attitude toward philosophy. I was convinced that there must be good argu-ments for the resolution of any philosophical question. My teachersseemed so sure of their own philosophical bearings. They never seemed to experience, let alone conde in us students, any qualms ormisgivings concer ning what they so condently professed. And for awhile I, too, shared something of what I took to be their attitude: thatone can achieve knowledge and certainty in philosophy, that with ef-fort and conscientiousness one could aspire to truth in philosophy justas one could in science. I believed that there were objective standardsin philosophy just as in science and that we philosophers could, if wewere willing to do the work, achieve consensus in our philosophy. Thirty-ve years later that youthful optimism has completely evaporated. I have unburdened myself of that comfortable delusion.Indeed, I have gone one step further. Unlike my own teachers, I oftenand emphatically explain my own views about philosophy to my stu-dents, telling them quite explicitly that although I am prepared topresent my views with as much verve as I can, I do not want them tomistake my enthusiasm for a conviction of certainty. I am certain of38 Beyond Experience almost nothing I teach my students. (And likewise for the bulk of this book.) My lack of certainty, however, has not dulled my interest. Cer- tainty has given way to what I regard as a more mature understandingof human theorizing. W do the best we can, but in the end we can e 9prove almost nothing of what we believe, say, or write. Why, exactly, this is so, or, more precisely, why exactly I believe this, I will try toexplain in the following two chapters. There I will argue that ourtheorizing is underdetermined by the evidence we offer in support of our theories. And I will argue that this indeterminacy is not just a fea-ture of our philosophizing, but permeates our attempts to do science aswell. But this is to anticipate. Some contemporary anthropologists and psychologists have taken to describing Homo sapiens as the storytelling species, and by this they mean that we human beings are constantly constructing stories(hypotheses / theories) in order to make sense of both the usual and theunusual. These stories range from the myths of primitive societies tothe highly sophisticated theories of quantum mechanics and astrophys-ics, from the commonplace (\" there are parallel black marks on thepavement; probably a car skidded \") to the highly speculative (\" there isintelligent life elsewhere in this galaxy \") and to the outrightly meta-physical (\" there is in each of us an immortal soul \"). But whether thismetaphysical view - that there exists within us a deep motivation totry to construct ever more and ever better explanations - ever achieveswide acceptance, there is one thing that must be said of it: it has an en-dearing kind of self-illustration, for it would itself appear to springfrom the very source it purports to describe. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9. \" ... the cause of philosophical disagreement ultimately lies in conflicting ' cognitive values ' that relate to such matters as importance, centrality, andpriority. ... Despite the inevitable strife of systems, scepticism regardingtraditional philosophy is not warranted. Because values - cognitive valuesincluded - are important to us as individuals, philosophy remains an impor-tant and worthwhile enterprise, notwithstanding its inability to achieve a ra-tionally constrained consensus on the fundamental issues. Indeed, given thenature of the enterprise, consensus is simply not a sensible goal, and failureto achieve it is not a defect \" (Rescher [171], xi).C H A P T E R F O U R Underdeter minism ( I ) T understand how it is even possible to pursue metaphysics, it is nec-o essary to begin by understanding the limits of what experience can tellus of the world,* and to understand how experiential (scientic)knowledge and metaphysics enjoy a symbiotic relationship. 4.1 The interconnectedness of science and metaphysicsIn the rst half of the twentieth century, there was a philosophical movement (c. 1920-45) which was openly hostile to metaphysics. Thedisaffection of the Logical P sitivists (also known as Logical Empiri- o cists) sprang principally from their antipathy to the highly speculativemetaphysics of a number of early-twentieth-centuryphilosophers. name Fichte, Schelling, Hegel,Bergson, and Heidegger ([44], 80). He illustrates (1932), with a quota-tion from Heidegger, the sort of metaphysics which he is intent toeliminate. What is to be investigated is being only and - nothing else; being alone and further - nothing; solely being, and beyond being - nothing. What about this Nothing? ... Does the Nothing exist only because the Not, i.e. the Negation, exists? Or is it the other way around? Does Negation and the Not exist only because the Nothing exists? ... W assert: the Nothing is priore to the Not and the Negation. ... Where do we seek the Noth- ing? How do we nd the Nothing. ... W know the Nothing. ... e Anxiety reveals the Nothing. ... That for which and because of which we were anxious, was ' really ' - nothing. Indeed: theNothing itself - as such - was present. ... What about this Nothing? - The Nothing itsel f nothings.

The translating of Heidegger 's writings into English has always been40 Beyond Experience A.J. A er continued the attack (1936) and used for his own example ofy unacceptable metaphysics ([16], 36) a slightly edited version of thelast sentence of this passage from F.H. Bradley: ... pure spirit is not realized except in the Absolute. It can never appear as such and with its full character in the scale ofexistence. P rfection and individuality belong only to that e Whole in which all degrees alike are at once present and ab-sorbed. This one Reality of existence can, as such, nowhereexist among phenomena. And it enters into, but is itself in-capable of, evolution and progress. ([33], 442) Moder n scholarship is not nearly so unsympathetic to these initially obscure-sounding pronouncements. Many moder n writers claim tond in them intelligibility and signicance not at all apparent to Car-nap, to A er, or to their fellow Logical P sitivists. Be that as it may, yo there is an undeniable difference between the style, the vocabulary,and the accessibility, on the one hand, of the metaphysics of Heideg-ger and Bradley, and on the other, of that of Strawson, for example, ofwhom we spoke briefly at the end of chapter 2. Suppose we comparethe selection from Heidegger with one drawn from the rst chapter ofStrawson 's Individuals . Both Heidegger and Strawson, we note, are endeavoring to explain what metaphysics is. W think of the world as containing particular things some ofe which are independent of ourselves; we think of the world 'shistory as made up of particular episodes in which we may ormay not have a part; and we think of these particular things andevents as included in the topics of our common discourse, asthings about which we can talk to each other. (Strawson [200],15) Metaphysics - at least as written by some philosophers - we see can be perfectly straightforward and readily comprehended. With examples drawn from the most speculative extremes of meta- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 problematic. What P p translates as \" being \", Hull and Crick translate as a \" what-is \" ([88], 358); and where P p coins the verb \" nothings \" and translates a Heidegger as saying \" The Nothing itself nothings \", Hull and Crick say\" Nothing ' nihilates ' of itself \" ([88], 369).Underdeter minism ( I ) 41 physics, the Logical P sitivists embarked on a program to try to o devise linguistic and logical tests by which they could separate ' scien-tically meaningful ' statements from what they called \" pseudo-state-ments \". Some of them were so incautious, even, as to call all of meta-physics, not just that which gave rise in the rst instance to theirdisapprobation, \" literal nonsense \". Nowadays metaphysics again needs no apology. The Logical P sitivists ' attack on metaphysics was relatively short-lived. F r aoo variety of technical reasons, their program to create what they called\" a criterion of empirical signicance \" was to prove impossible tocarry through. In due course, the P sitivists came to realize the futility o of their enterprise and abandoned it. Several philosophers (see e.g.Hempel [91]), including some of the P sitivists themselves, carefully o chronicled the successive attempts P sitivists made along the way. o Many explanations have been offered as to why the program was des-tined, ultimately, to fail. The most common explanation for the failure is that there is no par- ticular identifying feature of metaphysical statements. If a scientictheory happens to contain ' metaphysical ' statements, then those state-ments cannot be distinguished from the other ' non-metaphysical 'components of that theory. The source of the problem (from theP sitivists ' point of view) is that scientic theories are collections ofo diverse statements, and that sets of statements can only be tested al- together, i.e. one cannot, as a matter of logic, draw from a scientic theory testable implications whose truth or falsity redounds to thetruth or falsity of individual members of the set (see, for example,Hempel [91], 129). In short, according to this explanation, there seemsto be no way, either logically or linguistically, to isolate the ' meta-physical ' components of a scientic theory from its ' non-metaphysi-cal ' components. Such an explanation is, I think, incomplete. The problem lies deep- er. The P sitivists ' program was doomed, not just because it is impos-o sible to isolate the metaphysical components of a scientic theory, butrather, and more importantly, because metaphysical components areessential to any reasonable scientic theory. Scientic and metaphysi- cal theorizing go hand in hand; it is impossible to do either onewithout the other. Science is impossible without some metaphysical presuppositions; metaphysics is impossible, or at the very least sterilein the extreme, unless infor med by science (experience). Science andmetaphysics are one of a kind; the difference is merely one of degree.The most fundamental presuppositions of science, those furthest re-42 Beyond Experience moved from ' observational ' data, tend to be regarded as ' metaphysi- cal '. It is these which change most slowly, which are so much a partof working scientists ' conception of the world that scientists scarcelyattend to them in day-to-day work, spending most of their energiesinstead on that part of science which lends itself most easily to con-r mation, disconr mation, or revision in light of observation andexperiment. There is no question of logical or temporal priority in the interplay between our scientic and our metaphysical beliefs. T gether they o for m a world-view. This world-view is in constant flux. As scienceprogresses, our metaphysical views gradually change; and as meta-physical views change, adjustments are made within our science. 4.2 Case study: Francis Bacon 's account of induction\" What is heat? \" The question is deceptively simple. One is tempted to think that its answer ought to be a relatively trivial matter to settle.After all, heat is not an unfamiliar, rare commodity. W encounter it, e in varying degrees, throughout all our waking hours: in stoves, hot-water taps, light bulbs, automobile engines, noxious cigarettes, activemuscles, etc. Surely all a scientist has to do, we might be tempted tobelieve, is to examine instances of many such cases and it will bequickly obvious what heat is. Francis Bacon (1561-1626), for one, explicitly said exactly this in The New Organon of 1620: ... a nature [phenomenon] being given, we must rst of all have a muster or presentation ... of all known instances whichagree in the same nature, though in substances most unlike.And such collection must be ... without premature speculation... F r example, let the investigation be into ... heat. ...o 1. The rays of the sun, especially in summer and at noon. ... 3. Fiery meteors.4. Bur ning thunderbolts.5. Eruptions of flames from the cavities of mountains.6. All flames. ... 9. Liquids boiling or heated. ... 16. All bodies rubbed violently, as stone, wood, cloth, etc.Underdeter minism ( I ) 43 insomuch that poles and axles of wheels sometimes catch re ...... 25. Aromatic and hot herbs ... although not war m to the hand ..., yet to the tongue and palate, being a little masticated,they feel hot and bur ning.... 28. Other instances. ([20], 130-2) Bacon thinks, however, that humankind lacks the requisite intelligence to infer the nature of heat from a table consisting solely of positive in-stances. The difculty stems from the fact that, presented with anycollection of items however much seemingly initially unlike oneanother, we can - with a little ingenuity - nd not just one but severalcommon features. A rug, a chair, and a tea bag - to invent just oneexample - may share any number of features in common: they may allbe the same color; they may all be imported; they may all, to somedegree, be manufactured; they may all be purchased goods; they mayall be flammable; and so on. Drawing a single, correct, inference froma list of positive instances, Bacon thus believes, would be possibleonly by God and the angels, and perhaps by other higher intelligences(p. 151). Humankind, lacking the special faculties of divine intel-ligence, can reduce the number of detected commonalities only bysupplementing the list of positive instances with lists of negative in-stances. Thus, for example, where the rays of the sun had been therst item in his own list of positive instances, he contrasts this with\" the rays of the moon and stars and comets [which] are not found hotto the touch \" (133), and similarly, for each of the other twenty-onespecic items in his original list. And nally, he produces yet a thirdlist, this time of some forty-one items, discussing a variety of in-stances in which heat comes in various degrees. F r example, the o twenty-fth item in this third list reads: \" Some ignited bodies arefound to be much hotter than some flames. Ignited iron, for instance,is much hotter and more consuming than flame of spirit of wine[alcohol] \" (147). These methods of Bacon were to have a profound influence on phi- losophy. Two centuries later, we nd them little changed, repeated inJ.S. Mill 's Logic (1843) as the Method of Agreement, the Method of Difference, and the Method of Concomitant V riations. a Having gathered his data, and having rejected a great number of44 Beyond Experience hypotheses, e.g. the texture of materials, light or brightness, and rarity (pp. 154-5), Bacon states his conclusion: From a survey of the instances, all and each, of which the na- ture of heat is a particular case, [heat] appears to be motion.(156) In spite of its moder n sound, it is clear that Bacon 's notion of the nature of heat is very unlike that of moder n science. His subsequentcomments reveal that he has not made the moder n distinction betweenheat and temperature. Moder n science tells us, for example, that twoequal masses of water and iron at the same temperature contain differ-ent amounts of heat. It takes 8.4 times as much heat, for example, toraise 1 kg of water from 40 \u00b0C to 41\u00b0C than it does to raise 1 kg of iron 2from 40\u00b0C to 41\u00b0C. Nor does he conceive of heat as a quantity of xed amount, i.e. he has no inkling of the law of the conservation ofenergy. ... when heat is produced by the approach of a hot body, this ... depends ... on the nature of assimilation or self-multiplica-tion. ... multiplies and transfor ms bodies and sub- stances. ... Heat does not diffuse itself, in heating a body, bycommunication of the original heat but simply by exciting theparts of the body to that motion which is the for m of heat. (242) My purpose is not, however, to fault Bacon 's conclusions. My con- cer n lies with his discussion of how he supposedly arrived at thoseconclusions. At the most crucial point in all of this, at the juncture between having completed his review of his data and drawing his conclusions,Bacon offers no account whatsoever of how he proceeded to movefrom the for mer to the latter. Instead of an explanation, we nd simplya label: Bacon calls the process of moving from data to conclusion an\" induction \" (130). Earlier, he had spent several pages (18-23) explain-ing that this was to be regarded as a new kind of induction, a' legitimate ' sort of induction. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. This is to say, the specic heat of water is 8.4 times that of iron.Underdeter minism ( I ) 45 ... what the sciences stand in need of is a for m of induction which shall analyze experience and take it to pieces, and by adue process of exclusion and rejection lead to an inevitableconclusion. ... The testimony and infor mation of the sense [i.e.of sensory perception] has reference always to man, not theuniverse; and it is a great error to assert that the sense is ameasure of things. ... The mind, when it receives impressionsof objects through the sense, cannot be trusted to report themtruly, but in for ming its notions mixes up its own nature withthe nature of things. ... The intellect is not qualied to judgeexcept by means of induction, and induction in its legitimatefor m. (20-3) F r Bacon, human senses can, and often do, deceive. The human intel-o lect, either alone or in concert with the senses, is inadequate to thetask of nding the route to Nature 's \" rst principles ... [which] lie atthe heart and marrow of things \" (20). The only way, according toBacon, to proceed is by induction. And he thought, too, not only thathis induction could generate new ' notions ' but that it provided theonly means to do so: \" induction must be used ... in the for mation ofnotions \" (99). But while Bacon is expansive in his praise of induction, he is strangely silent in explaining precisely what it is supposed to be orhow it works. He is completely silent about how induction might get us from observational data to explanatory hypothesis, or how onemight lear n the technique or teach it to someone else. There are norules stated; there are not even any hints given. This seemingly minoroversight is of the utmost importance for our understanding how sci-ence is underdetermined,* and for identical reasons, how metaphysicsis underdetermined. Bacon did not explain how he was able to generate his conclusions from his data, not, as some might suppose, because he simplyneglected to make the details of the step explicit. Rather the explana-tion for the omission is that no such account (of the step which gener-ates conclusions from data) is even possible, and this for the reasonthat it is overwhelmingly likely that there is in fact no such step at all.Bacon never did, his claims to the contrary, generate his conclusionabout the nature of heat from the survey he had conducted. The statistics branch of mathematics has, since the late eighteenth century, provided us with a certain, steadily increasing, collection ofinductive techniques. F r example, moder n polling techniques attempt o46 Beyond Experience to predict the behavior or choices of a wider population on the basis of 3sampling a subset* of that population. In this instance, the inference is from the few to the many. Sometimes a statistical inference may gothe other way, as, for example, from the knowledge that 81% of thechildren in a school system are black, one might infer that more than60% of the children in some one school in the system are black. Inthese instances, what we nd is that features of certain aggregates are 3posited to hold of other aggregates (often a subset or superset* of theoriginal aggregates). What it is essential to note in these and in manyother sorts of inductive inferences sanctioned within statistics is that itis typically the scope of a feature which is being extrapolated, not the introduction or discer ning of new features. Bacon 's ' induction ' is re-markably different. Indeed Bacon takes some pains to contrast hisown kind of induction with statistical for ms which he calls \" simpleenumeration \" (98). Bacon claims that by using his considerably morepowerful induction, he can glean from his data, taken collectively, cer-tain features of each individual item, features which are anything butapparent in those individual items themselves. The inference thus isvery unlike the inference that \" Sally Jones has green eyes; her brotherhas green eyes; therefore all the other Jones 's children as well havegreen eyes. \" In this latter instance, the data explicitly contains theinformation about each child examined that he / she has green eyes.Bacon 's data is not at all like this. Many, if not most, of his data items contain no explicit mention of motion. Consider item 17: \" Green and moist vegetables conned andbruised together, as roses in baskets; insomuch that hay, if damp,when stacked, often catches re \"; or item 13: \" All villous [long-haired] substances, as wool, skins of animals, and down of birds, haveheat \" (131). One looks in vain for any explicit or implicit mentionhere of \" motion \". Indeed, on the basis of ' data ' such as this, if, that is,we were to consider wool as ' having heat ', most of us would be posi-tively insistent that whatever it is we are trying to explain, call it heator whatever, is surely not a for m of motion. What, after all, is moreinert, i.e. motionless, than a clump of wool? It is clear that one cannot' read off ' of data such as this the conclusion that heat is motion. Thetrouble is that Bacon has adduced a conclusion intended to explain allof his data but in which there occurs a descriptive ter m \" motion \"which does not occur in all or, for that matter, in even very many of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. F r denition in Glossary, see under \" set \".oUnderdeter minism ( I ) 47 his premises. Indeed, Bacon 's conclusion was not to prove convincing either to his contemporaries or to several subsequent generations ofscientists. When a majority of scientists nally did begin to adopt thetheory that heat is motion, in the mid-nineteenth century, it was forreasons remarkably different from the sorts of reasons (and reasoning)advanced by Bacon. In contemporary philosophy, it is common practice to distinguish two, fundamentally different, senses of \" induction \". On the one handwe recognize the historical use of \" induction \" in the sense we havejust seen promoted by Bacon. In this rst sense, \" induction \" is said todescribe the inferential step from data to a hypothesis explaining thatdata. On the other hand, \" induction \" is also used to describe the logicwhich endeavors to explain, and indeed in some cases to assignnumerical values to, the amount of weight a certain body of evidencelends to the support or credibility of a hypothesis. In this latter case,there is no suggestion of one 's being able to generate the hypothesis from the data; both hypothesis and data (evidence) are taken as' given ' (however each might have been arrived at), and the only mat-ter to be examined by induction is the extent to which the evidencesupports the hypothesis. Briefly, the distinction between the twosenses of \" induction \" is reflected in the two phrases \" logic of dis-covery \" and \" logic of justication \". Bacon clearly thought his inductive methods constituted a logic of discovery, that by the careful, systematic, unbiased collecting of dataone could ' by induction ' simply ' read off ' from that data its explana-tion. Beginning in the twentieth century, a number of philosophers - in- cluding, especially, K. P pper, H. Reichenbach, R. Carnap, and C. o Hempel - have scor ned this Baconian concept of induction. The con-trary thesis, that there is a logic of discovery, had - until very recently- been defended by only a tiny handful of philosophers, principallyJ.S. Mill (1806-73), C.S. P irce (1839-1914), and N.R. Hanson 4(1924-67). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. In 1962, the historian Thomas Kuhn published The Structure of Scientic Revolutions in which he clearly sides with the opinion that there is no logic of discovery. But he argues further that there is no logic of justication either,that the process of accepting or rejecting a scientic theory does not lend it-self to appraisal or prediction by logical rules, that ultimately a great numberof nonlogical factors influence scientists ' decisions to abandon an old theory48 Beyond Experience Those philosophers who have argued against the very possibility of there being a Baconian logic of discovery have been able to use a so-called bottom-line argument, in effect saying: \" If there really is a logicof discovery, show it to us, state its rules and principles so that we andanyone else can apply it to do useful work of scientic discovery. \" Unexpectedly, the challenge was taken up. Researchers in Cogni- tive Science have, for the last thirty years, been actively engaged in 5precisely this pursuit. They have been trying to discover the wayshuman beings actually go about making scientic discoveries andhave been trying to emulate those methods in computer programs. As each new science has developed it has revealed an underlying order where none had been previously noted. If we lacked scienticknowledge, most of what happens in the world would appear to us ascapricious, random, or the presumed handiwork of a hidden super-natural intelligence. But science frequently reveals an underlyingorder: in the ways elements for m compounds; in the ways livingbodies ght diseases; in the ways characteristics are passed fromparent to child; in the ways earthquakes come about; in the waysobjects fall; etc. Even something as seemingly haphazard as themeandering of streams is found to be explainable (Einstein [65]). So,too, with the subject matter of Cognitive Science. What, prior torecent research in Cognitive Science, appeared to be one of the mostcapricious, undetermined, of all activities, viz. problem solving, hasbeen revealed, under careful study, to have an unsuspected underlying \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and to accept a new one. (W will see for ourselves below, when we come to e the next case study, how scientists can resist abandoning one theory evenwhen experimental data are produced which are found to be compellingrefutation in the minds of some other scientists.) Arguments similar to thoseof Kuhn are found, too, in the writings of P ul Feyerabend (see e.g. [71]). T ao a limited extent, this moder n historiographical repudiation of a logic of jus-tication had been foreshadowed by Pierre Duhem and by Max Planck.Planck had written: \" An important scientic innovation rarely makes its wayby gradually winning over and converting its opponents. ... What does hap-pen is that its opponents gradually die out and the growing generation isfamiliarized with the idea from the beginning \" ([154], 97; see also [155],33-4). The views of Duhem, Planck, Kuhn, and Feyerabend have not,however, won unanimous endorsement from other philosophers and remaincontroversial. 5. Much of this research - theoretical and experimental - was both under- taken and inspired by Herbert A. Simon. See, e.g., [111].Underdeter minism ( I ) 49 order. Although they are not at all obvious to casual observation, the study under controlled conditions of problem solving is revealing setsof strategies and ploys used by virtually everyone. Problem solvingtur ns out not to be a wild flailing about in a search for anything at allthat ' works '. Problem solving is often methodical and systematic. Those cognitive scientists who have lately revived the claim that there is a logic of discovery base their assertion on their equatingscientic discovery with nothing but (a specialized kind of ) problemsolving: \" A hypothesis that will be central to our inquiry is that themechanisms of scientic discovery are not peculiar to that activity butcan be subsumed as special cases of the general mechanisms of 6problem solving \" (Langley et al. [119], 5). But how legitimate is suchan identication? Can scientic discovery realistically be equated withproblem solving, or is there something more to scientic discoverythan merely solving a problem? Of course scientic discovery is some kind of problem solving. It would be pointless to deny that. Bacon had a problem: \" What isheat? \" And his eventual answer, \" Heat is motion \", might, in somesense, be regarded as a ' solution ' to that problem. But was his ' route 'to his ' solution ' via a logic, as he claimed; or was it something else, as a great many other philosophers subsequently insisted? The way Bacon conceived of inductive logic, and the model criticized by many of his successors, was as a logic of discoveryunderstood to be something akin to a calculation. The idea was thatone should be able to gather data, subject it to a calculation in accordwith some speciable formula or recipe, and generate therefrom asolution. Metaphorically we can conceive of a logic of discovery asbeing a kind of ' logic engine ': one feeds in the data as input, one tur nsthe crank, and the engine outputs the solution. Such a model suggestsa possible realization, not in some visionary apparatus, but in some-thing as mundane as a moder n, large-scale digital computer. Indeed 7cognitive scientists regard the test of their theories to reside just in \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. This book, Scientic Discovery: Computational Explorations of the Crea- tive Process , contains an extensive bibliography of important work in this eld. 7. In the remainder of this chapter I will use the expression \" cognitive scien- tists \" for those researchers in cognitive psychology, articial intelligence( A I), etc. who advance the theory that scientic discovery is a kind of prob- lem solving replicable (in principle) in a program for a digital computer. In50 Beyond Experience their (eventually) programming computers to act as engines of dis- covery. Can such an engine of discovery be built? Equivalently, can com- puter programs be devised which will generate explanatory hypothe-ses from observational data? The cognitive scientists say, \" Y s ... in e principle. \" Their opponents say, \" No. \" Critics of the claim that a logic of discovery is nothing but a kind of problem solving point to two major differences between what cogni-tive scientists offer as cases of problem solving and what often havebeen applauded as cases of scientic discovery. As in any new sci-ence, there is a great deal of optimism, a slighting of difculties, and a 8tendency to exaggerate the signicance of initial ndings. And, inthis particular case, there has also been a marked penchant for the dis-putants to argue past one another, often because of subtle shifts in themeanings of central ter ms in the debate. A substantial part of the writings of cognitive scientists lays out the experimental ndings which reveal how persons will systematicallysearch through what these scientists call \" the hypothesis space \" (moreon this later, footnote 25, p. 187). Their intent is to show that personsdo not search among alter native hypotheses aimlessly but do so usingwhat have come to be called heuristics : rules of thumb, earlier suc- cessful techniques, etc. But to argue, as some cognitive scientists frequently do, that these ndings are good evidence in support of there being a logic of dis-covery is to overstate the case. F r the philosophers who have argued o against the logic of discovery do not contend that there is no rationalway to select among alter native hypotheses for testing. Their claim,rather, has been that there is no rational means for generating thehypotheses in the rst instance. Their objection is that these cognitive \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 using this ter m in this fashion I am of course distorting the ordinary meaning of the expression. It is just that there is no agreed-upon alter native expres-sion, and I am loath to coin a neologism. I hope that no confusion will result. 8. In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, researchers in machine translation of natural languages and in machine (visual-)patter n recognition believed thatwithin a few years they would be able to program computers to emulatehuman abilities. Subsequent developments, however, revealed that theproblems they were tackling were very much more difcult than supposed atthe outset. Initial progress was rapid, but soon gave way to steadily diminish-ing gains as the remaining problems grew harder and harder.Underdeter minism ( I ) 51 scientists are helping themselves to too much, are starting, as it were, too late in the day. Given a wealth of hypotheses, one might wellargue that there is some strategy for moving among them to selectcandidates for testing. But that is to misrepresent the problem. Thereal problem lies earlier: in the formulating of the hypotheses initially. But perhaps the point on which the cognitive scientist and the phi- losopher-critic will differ most is on the second, viz. the prospects ofadducing a set of heuristics capable of yielding those special scienticdiscoveries which we regard as standing in an exalted, privilegedniche: the scientic breakthroughs, the new scientic theories. Much of what cognitive scientists regard with pride as being cases of scientic (re)discovery their critics will dismiss as cases of mere 9curve tting. These critics argue that what is needed to generate agenuinely new scientic theory - a theory which goes beyond being asingle law and is instead a comprehensive way of looking at a largebody of varied data - is precisely the abandonment of heuristics. Whatis needed are not rules of thumb, or familiar strategies for solvingproblems, but an act of creative imagination. As long ago as 1949,Herbert Buttereld laid the groundwork for an objection to regardingscientic discoveries, particularly those discoveries we call ' break-throughs ' or ' revolutionary ', as being cases of (ordinary) problemsolving: ... of all for ms of mental activity, the most difcult to induce ... is the art of handling the same bundle of data as before, butplacing them in a new system of relations with one another bygiving them a different framework, all of which virtually meansputting on a different kind of thinking-cap for the moment. ...The supreme paradox of the scientic revolution is the fact thatthings which we nd it easy to instill into boys at school ... -things which would strike us as the ordinary natural way oflooking at the universe, the obvious way of regarding the be-haviour of falling bodies, for example - defeated the greatestintellects for centuries, defeated Leonardo da Vinci and at the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9. Trying to nd computer programs to generate formulas to t graphed data (curve tting) is a task which engineers have been pursuing in industry sinceat least the 1950s. Fifty years ago, no one regarded such programs as model-ing scientic discovery. It is only more recently that cognitive scientists havecome to regard them in that way.52 Beyond Experience marginal point even Galileo, when their minds were wrestling on the very frontiers of human thought with these very prob-lems. ([40], 1-2) No existing computer program (least of all the ones ironically named \" B A C O N.1 \" to \" B A C O N.6 \" [119]), nor any likely to be devel- oped along lines currently being pursued by cognitive scientists, couldpossibly emulate or replicate Bacon 's own thought processes (what-ever they were) which led him to hypothesize that heat is motion. Norealistically foreseeable computer program can bridge the gap betweendata which list a variety of hot things and the creation of the hypothe-sis \" Heat is motion. \" Or consider, as another example, Newton 's second law of motion published in the Principia in 1687 (here reworded): \" An object will experience an acceleration directly proportional to, and parallel to, theresultant of the total forces acting on it, and indirectly proportional toits mass. \" No amount of observing the world could ever provide datafrom which to generate such a law. F r eons, presumably for all of o time, prior to Newton 's appearance on the scene, there had beenmassy objects, i.e. objects having mass. But mass, unlike weight, is afeature of the world which is not directly observable by any human sense. Newton did not observe the property mass, he posited it, i.e. hehypothesized it as part of a solution to a puzzle. He did that by invent-ing the concept of mass, or, if you nd the notion of inventing a con- cept problematic, you could say that Newton introduced the concept 10of mass to science. His posit was insightful and protable beyond \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. There is an important distinction to be made between our having a con- cept (e.g. our having a concept of a unicor n, our having a concept of thesuperego) and there being anything in the world which exemplies that con-cept (e.g. there actually being a unicor n, there actually being a superego). Ipersonally happen to have a fairly ' realistic ' attitude concer ning the status ofthe referents of useful concepts in science. That is, if a concept in scienceseems to do the job, if it allows us to state useful and approximately truehypotheses, then I am inclined to regard that concept as referring to someactually existent thing or property in the world. However, a concept mayprove useful, even necessary, to a scientic theory without there beinganything in the world which it describes (refers to). F r example, Newton o also posited ' punctifor m ' masses, i.e. objects having mass but occupyingonly a mathematical point in space, that is, having zero depth, length, andUnderdeter minism ( I ) 53 his ability to foresee. (It was also, we might note with some interest, eventually to be signicantly emended by Einstein more than two cen-turies later, in 1905.) Newton 's invention (introduction) of the conceptof mass was a product of his fecund creative imagination, not of anysuperior powers of observation, not of his possessing a logic of dis- 11covery, and not of his utilizing some ' heuristic '. It was as novel, andas free of being gover ned by a logic or set of recipes, as was, for \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 height. Few physicists, if any, believe that there actually are any punctifor m masses in Nature, however useful the concept punctifor m mass may be in their theories. Realism need not, then, be an unqualied belief in the actualexistence of things or properties corresponding to every theoretical ter m ofscience. Scientic realism usually is something less than a one-to-one map-ping of theoretical ter ms onto unique features of the world. Although I have just incidentally admitted that I am a realist about mass, it is important to mention that there is considerable dispute about the wisdomof adopting such a realist position about the relations between the concepts ofscience and features of the world. One may, instead, adopt an instrumentalistattitude, arguing that scientic concepts may be justied by their successfulrole within a scientic theory and that one need not take the further step ofbelieving that these concepts refer to bona de features of the world. The dis-pute between scientic realists and instrumentalists runs very deep. I willretur n to a discussion of the concept of property in chapter 9; however, I will not pursue in this book the dispute between scientic realists and instrumen-talists. Although it is an important dispute within metaphysics, it is not on theagenda for this particular book. 11. Langley et al. cite Clark Glymour 's reconstruction ([78]) of the route by which Newton likely arrived at his second law of motion, F = ma, and assert that these steps are capable of being programmed so as to permit a computerto output the same formula given Newton 's data as input ([119], 54-6). ButNewton 's accomplishment was not simply the stating of a mathematicalrelationship between certain variables, \" F \", \" m \", and \" a \". In Newton 's hands, these were interpreted symbols, standing for, respectively, force, mass, and acceleration. What Newton could do, and computer programs ofthe sort described by Langley et al. cannot do, is to utilize the concept of mass in a comprehensive view, i.e. theory, of the world. T output the string o of symbols \" F = ma \", as a computer might do, even as a solution to a par- ticular problem we set for the computer using Newton 's data, is not to have atheory or to have invented the concept of mass . The symbol \" m \" is not a con- cept. T describe a computer 's outputting of \" F = ma \" as a ' rediscovery ' of o Newton 's second law of motion is to caricature, indeed to misrepresentegregiously, Newton 's accomplishment.54 Beyond Experience example, Beethoven 's composing the W ldstein Sonata. Just as therea are no known rules by which to write sublime music, there are noknown rules by which to invent new scientic concepts or to generate 12scientic hypotheses in which these new concepts occur. The insistence, by many philosophers, that there are no such gener- ative rules, either known or unknown, strikes many persons who areapproaching philosophy for the rst time as mistaken. These personsrecall having been taught in high school something called ' the scien-tic method '. \" Surely, \" they want to retort, \" there is a method forgenerating scientic hypotheses. \" If there were, then the history of science ought to have been very different from what it in fact has been. If there really were a logic ofdiscovery, some logical procedure, some set of rules, by which onecould get from observation to explanatory hypothesis, we shouldexpect that the history of science would simply be a history of succes-sive successes without any controversy or false starts. But the historyof science is not at all of this latter sort. It is, instead, a history of asuccession of guesses, of controversy, of disputes, of competing theo-ries, of occasional successes, and of far more failures. The world furnishes up to us its secrets extremely begrudgingly. Nature 's ' deep secrets ' are not written on the surface, as it were. Noamount of careful observation can ever reveal the greater part of what we want to know. Observation of the world, no matter how carefullydone, is an inadequate tool by itself for understanding the world. Tounderstand the world, we need essentially to proceed by guessing, orif you like, by hypothesizing, and by testing those guesses (hypothe- 13ses). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12. A third objection to the cognitive scientists ' claim that there is logic of discovery, an objection which argues that heuristics are not effective algo-rithms, will be examined in the following section. Unlike the two objectionsjust leveled, this third objection will be rejected, the counterargument beingthat although heuristics are not effective, to demand effective algorithms for alogic of discovery is to set an impossibly high requirement. 13. Later (in section 10.7, pp. 311ff.) we will examine a contemporary problem, \" What is mind? \", that is remarkably similar to Bacon 's problem,\" What is heat? \", in that it, too, dees answer by recourse to simple observa-tion or by an analysis which would construe it as a problem to be solved viaheuristics. W will see how the answer to this contemporary puzzle can come e about only through bold imaginative theory-construction.Underdeter minism ( I ) 55 4.3 Metaphysical strands in The New Organon How, we might ask, did Bacon manage to make such a grievous error about scientic methodology*? How might we explain how he cameto believe that one could ' read off ' of Nature its secrets? I think itworthwhile, particularly given the wider purposes of this book, todwell a bit longer on this remarkable episode in history. It is easy, but nonetheless mistaken, to conceive of Bacon, in ad- vancing his methods, as engaging solely in a piece of philosophizing.One may think of his implementing his methods, or his illustrating those methods, by his actually constructing the various tables we havesampled above, as his doing science . Used, as we have become, to in- sisting on a distinction between doing philosophy and doing science,we may be tempted to try to partition the material of The New Organon into nonoverlapping categories: the description of the meth- ods is philosophy; the practice of those methods is science. Even if Bacon himself did not mark out his work in that way, we, in hindsight,working with more rened concepts, can. I think that were we to do this, we would commit an error. F r I o think the best way to make sense of what Bacon was doing is to try toreconstruct what world-view he might have held which would leadhim to advance the methods he did. Once we have done that, theresult, I suggest, will defy categorization as either philosophy alone oras science alone. In short, if we try to imagine Bacon 's world-view,we will discover that his methods were neither philosophy nor sciencealone, but an inseparable amalgam of the two. One might think that it is possible to know a priori* that Bacon 's methods could not work. After all, the inductive leap from observa-tional data to an explanatory hypothesis is universally acknowledgedto be risky, i.e. not one guaranteed to reveal the truth. Even cognitivescientists who have argued that scientic discovery is a kind of prob-lem solving, all of which proceeds via heuristics, have been careful toinsist that heuristics are not effective algorithms*, that heuristics carryno guarantee of even a single solution, and hence no guarantee of aunique solution, still less any guarantee of providing ' the correct 'solution. Without an ironclad guarantee, however, it might be sup-posed, strictly as a matter of logic, that any and every attempt to createa logic of discovery is doomed to failure. It might be thought, that is,that it is logically impossible that there should be a logic of discovery. This pessimistic conclusion is too strong. If one makes it a matter of the very denition of the ter m \" logic \" that its results must always be56 Beyond Experience certain, i.e. that logic is truth-preserving in the sense that applying its rules to a set of true premises can produce only true conclusions, then- just as a matter of denition - there can be no logic of discovery.But if we allow a weaker sense of \" logic \", by which we mean a set ofstated, although not foolproof, rules (heuristics) by which to proceed,as when, for example, we talk of the ' logic ' of making a medical diag-nosis, it remains an entirely open question whether even a crude' logic ' of discovery is possible for the generating of explanatoryhypotheses from observational data. It is this weaker sense of \" logic \"which philosophers such as P irce and Hanson and present-day cogni- e tive scientists have clearly had in mind when they have tried to defendthe thesis that there is some ' logic ' gover ning the activities of scien-tists in their search for laws. It may well be that we never do succeed in devising a useful set of rules by which we can generate powerful explanatory hypotheses fromobservational data. But we will not know whether or not the goal ispossible without our actively trying. Whether or not anything like alogic of discovery is possible depends on two critical factors: one, onthe way the world is; and two, on our cleverness in making explicitcanons (heuristics) for discovery. Although I am strongly of theopinion that a logic of discovery which goes beyond curve tting andnding generalizations in data to being able to generate powerfulexplanatory theories is not realizable, my pessimism is not groundedin a priori or metaphysical principles. It stems, rather, from a convic-tion arising from my own experiential assessment of how complex theworld is and how ingenious and multifaceted our explanations of theworld have had to be in order to make sense of, and be able to explain,that complexity. Like cognitive scientists, I, too, believe that the ques-tion whether there is a logic of discovery is strictly an empirical* one(i.e. one to be decided solely by experience, not by a priori reason).But unlike many cognitive scientists I am convinced that scientic dis-covery is like ordinary problem solving only up to a point, that beyondthat - when one comes to making scientic breakthroughs, doing whatis sometimes called \" revolutionary \" science - what is called for is notthe application of familiar heuristics, but the creating of unforeseenand radically new ways of explaining the old and familiar. W cannot know what sort of world this is without actively explor-e ing it. It might have been a terribly simple world, one in which Naturereally does reveal (pretty much) all that is to be known simply by ourobserving it. It just may be that there is some possible world (here Ianticipate chapter 6) in which the sorts of rudimentary methods BaconUnderdeter minism ( I ) 57 advanced would prove very much more successful than they have proven in this world. The point is, however, that neither Bacon noranyone else could know precisely which sort of world this one hap-pens to be without actually trying out their methods to see whether,and if so to what extent, they worked. It tur ns out that this world isvastly more complicated than Bacon supposed. The subsequent courseof science has found it more and more necessary to hypothesize allsorts of features hidden from direct observation (e.g. subatomic par-ticles, electromagnetic elds, gravitational elds, free markets, capital,infor mation content, and placebo effects) in order to explain those fea-tures which are observable. One could not know a priori that extraor-dinarily imaginative and creative hypothesizing along with the posit-ing of arcane features would be needed for signicant advancementsin science. Such knowledge is attainable only by the verdict of experi-ence, by actually trying simple methods to see whether they could bemade to yield successful theories and by nding that they cannot. T try to sort out in Bacon 's methods what in particular waso prompted by ' metaphysical ' considerations and what by purely ' scien-tic ' considerations is a hopeless task. Is the belief that Nature is rela-tively simple a scientic or a metaphysical belief ? Our rst, natural,response is to regard this question as a metaphysical one. But if onehas - as Bacon had - a relatively simple science, and if that science,conning its observations pretty much to what unaided perception canfurnish, produces results which are generally accepted and found use-ful, and if its explanations are regarded as satisfactory, then is thebelief that Nature is simple not a belief warranted, not by metaphysics,but by science itself ? Such a question strikes me as having no deter-minate answer. There is no determinate answer, I suggest, becausedoing science and doing metaphysics blend into one another to such adegree as to make any attempt at dissociation futile. Bacon 's views about the possibility of a logic of discovery were a product of a scientic outlook infor med by late-sixteenth-century sci-ence. Sixteenth-century scientists and philosophers had no idea, norcould they have had an inkling, how complex the world is and how much the future course of scientic development would come to relyon positing a staggering complexity ' behind the appearances '. Theycould not have known, until they actually tried, and found wanting,methods which relied more heavily on observation than on creativeimagination. T nd excessive error in Bacon 's manner of doing sci- o ence is to believe that the criteria for judgment are ahistorical. If theyare, then our own methods may come to be regarded as being as ' mis-58 Beyond Experience taken ' as Bacon 's. But if Bacon 's ' methods ' were a product of the late-sixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century world-views, his ownviews about the nature of explanation itself were rather more fore-sighted. There is no authoritative account of the nature of explanation. What sorts of accounts are considered to be ' explanatory ' change from timeto time and place to place. T day many persons nd it peculiar that o throughout much of history so many persons were content with whatwe now, somewhat pejoratively, call ' teleological ' explanations. F r o our ancestors, very often to explain why an event occurred was tostate what purpose it served in the ' grand scheme of things '. Why wasa person bor n? An answer might have been \" to seek the good \" or \" toglorify God \". T day an answer more likely will be in ter ms of antece- o dent events: two sexually mature adults had sexual intercourse; asper m fertilized an egg; or some such account. W have, in moder n e times, switched our expectations about the very nature of explanationitself. W rarely offer or expect explanations, particularly within thee ' non-life ' sciences (such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology,and meteorology), to be in ter ms of purpose; rather we expect expla-nations in those sciences to cite causal factors. Only within the ' life 'sciences, biology and medicine, does one still nd teleological expla-nations - e.g. \" the purpose of the kidneys is to lter impurities fromthe blood \" - and even there a preponderance of explanations are 14causal, not teleological. Bacon, himself, was one of the principalcritics of the traditional teleological mode of explanation. He arguedstrenuously for the adoption within physics of the causal model in-stead: ... the treating of nal causes [i.e. the search for purpose] in physics has driven out the inquiry of physical ones, and mademen rest in specious and shadowy causes, without ever search-ing in ear nest after such as are real and truly physical. ... \" Theleaves of trees are to defend the fruit from the sun and wind.The clouds are designed for watering the earth, \" etc. All ...[such examples] ... in physics are impertinent and ... hinder the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 14. In contemporary social science, many explanations which may at rst appear to be teleological are often disguised causal explanations. T say of a o person that she did something \" with the goal (or purpose) of ... \" is to offerthat person 's having the goal as a cause of her behavior.Underdeter minism ( I ) 59 sciences from holding on their course of improvement, and introduce a neglect of searching after physical causes. ([19],chap. V I, p. 97) Bacon 's views about the roles of teleological and causal explanations were, in due course, to prevail; they were, it tur ns out, farsighted,almost prescient. But we must be careful not to think that Bacon (andwe) now have ' got it right ', that earlier in history when persons wereas likely as not to offer and accept explanations in ter ms of purpose,they had ' got it wrong '. W must be careful not to think that causal e explanation is ' right ' and teleological explanation is ' mistaken '. Is it possible to know a priori whether there is purpose in Nature, or is this an empirical question? If empirical, what would show it to betrue? to be false? If a priori, how could we know it to be true? to befalse? My own inclination is to regard the question whether or notthere is purpose in Nature as a metaphysical one, one which ' goesbeyond ' the possibility of experience to answer. But in saying that it isa metaphysical question, I do not mean that it can be settled a priori;quite the contrary, whether we choose to favor teleological or causalexplanations depends to a very great extent on the manner in whichwe practice science and on whether that way is successful. W adopte the causal model (or ' paradigm ' in Kuhn 's terminology), not becausethere are persuasive a priori arguments in its favor, and not becausethere is compelling empirical data to warrant that belief. W favor e causal explanations because, given our data, given the way science hasdeveloped, the causal paradigm suits our purposes, and guides ourresearch, better. The causal paradigm has gradually, over several centuries, nearly entirely displaced the teleological paradigm, but there were no crucial,denitive, empirical data uncovered, and there were few strong philo-sophical arguments offered, to have warranted the changeover. It israther that, as science progressed, as more and more causal explana-tions were found, and were found useful, persons gradually came toabandon the one model of explanation for the other. 4.4 Case study: Rumford and the CaloristsQuestions such as \" What is heat? \", \" What is mind? \", and \" What is a person? \" cannot be answered by observing Nature, neither casually nor in the most conscientious, scrupulously diligent manner possible.If one really could settle such a profound question as \" What is heat? \"60 Beyond Experience by observing Nature, then Bacon - with his elaborate lists - would have settled the matter. But subsequent theorizing about the nature ofheat, over the course of nearly four centuries, right up to and includingpresent-day research, provides compelling evidence of the insufcien-cy of Bacon 's optimistic methods. Bacon 's methods, although possi-bly suited for some world or other, an imagined world very muchsimpler than this one, were woefully inadequate to guide the develop-ing course of science in the actual world. Bacon published The New Organon in 1620, some twenty-eight years after Galileo had invented the rst (crude) thermometer. Theseearliest thermometers lacked scales and, because they were open tothe surrounding atmosphere, were signicantly affected by changes inbarometric pressure. It was not until 1641 that the rst sealed ther-mometer was invented and not until the 1660s that standards emergedfor calibrating the scales of thermometers ([174], 120-25). But oncescientists had in hand serviceable instruments to measure temperature,the investigation of heat permanently switched from the sort of naturalhistory practiced by Bacon to quantitative research. In the onehundred years after Bacon 's death, scientists discovered that variousmaterials had remarkably different specic heats (see footnote 2, p.44) and discovered the phenomenon of latent heat (the heat of fusion,i.e. the heat needed to melt a substance, and the heat of vaporization,i.e. the heat needed to vaporize a substance). Where Bacon had merelyproduced lists of items ' having heat ', his successors tur ned theirefforts to measuring the amounts of heat needed to effect changes insubstances. While the developing quantitative and experimental methods seemed well suited to answering such questions as \" How much heat isabsorbed by one pound of ice in melting? \", these same quantitativemethods seemed unable to answer Bacon 's initial, and ' deeper ', ques-tion \" What is heat itself ? \" Bacon 's own answer had been, we haveseen, that heat is motion. This theory is sometimes called the\" dynamic \" view, and later, toward the end of the nineteenth century,came to bear its moder n name, the \" kinetic \" theory of heat. Thedynamic theory was, in effect, that the heat of objects and of gases isdue to the vibration of their constituent particles (\" atoms \" or\" molecules \" in moder n terminology). These postulated vibrationswere also sometimes referred to as \" intestine [internal] tremors \". Butthe trouble with Bacon 's conclusions about the nature of heat was thatthose conclusions could not be seen by his successors, in spite of hisclaim that those conclusions were reached by an induction, to be inUnderdeter minism ( I ) 61 any way dictated by or generable from his data. Nor, for that matter, was his theory the sort which was much favored in the eighteenth cen-tury. F r at that time, the scientic climate favored a static theory.o Gases, it was readily observed, were ' elastic ': they resisted com- pression and would expand to ll their container. How was one toexplain this phenomenon? According to Newton, all material objects(the particles of gases included) attract one another. Why then should a gas expand to ll its container, rather than collapse into a liquid or asolid? Obviously - so reasoned many scientists - there must be arepulsive force as well, a force opposing the gravitational attraction ofthe particles. Where did such a repulsive force originate? An ' internaltremor ' seemed not especially promising as a source of repulsiveforces. (T cite a moder n analogy: the vibrating strings of a guitar do o not seem to repel one another.) Instead, theorists tur ned to adapt whatthey could of Newtonian theory, the most successful physical theorythat humankind had yet produced. Just as material particles attract oneanother under gravitational forces, there ' must be ' - they reasoned -another kind of substance whose particles repel one another and whichlie between the particles of matter. The route to the theory is fairly obvious: if forces are pushes or pulls (the only sorts of forces recognized in Newtonian mechanics)and if material particles attract one another, and if gases expand ratherthan collapse, there ' must ' then be other sorts of particles, nonmaterialones, whose nature it is to repel one another, rather than to attract. Itwas understandable, then, that theorists should postulate another, non-material, kind of stuff, a stuff which permeated gases and physicalobjects, and which tended to drive apart the material particles. Thisposited stuff came to be regarded as a kind of fluid and was called\" caloric \". Inasmuch as most materials and gases expand when heated,it was an easy and obvious step to identify this caloric with heat itself.Why do material objects expand when heated? Simply because morecaloric had been added to them and the additional caloric exercised astronger repulsive force causing the expansion. There was no need inthis theory for attributing any motion, vibrational or random, to theparticles of caloric. Their sheer number, not their activity, was whataccounted for expansion, sensations of elevated temperature, melting,etc. And thus the caloric theory was regarded as the ' static ' theory ofheat. On this theory, heat was a kind of stuff; it was not a vibration ortremor or motion of material particles. There was at least one other major factor favoring the caloric theory. In areas of physics outside of heat - in light, in magnetism,62 Beyond Experience and in electricity - all the best theories of the time were theories of special kinds of fluids, i.e. light, magnetism, and electricity were allthought to be accountable for in ter ms of special, subtle, weightlessfluids. It would be an understatement, indeed something of a distor-tion, to say that positing the existence of caloric was done on analogy with the theories of light, electricity, and magnetism. Quite the con-trary, the positing was done in accord with the overriding model ofwhat the world was like. T posit a fluid to account for the nature of o heat was as natural and as acceptable in the eighteenth century as it isin our own day to posit a virus as the cause of some particular disease.If today we were to describe a scientist who posited a virus as thecause of, let us say, multiple sclerosis, as proceeding by constructingan analogy with the explanation of the cause of poliomyelitis, wewould, I think, feel that we had seriously underdescribed (if I may bepermitted to coin such a word) the situation. P siting viruses nowa- o days as the causes of specic diseases is not so much constructing ananalogy as it is simply following the normal, accepted, and expectedpractices of biological theorizing. Put another way, our positing avirus in this instance is in keeping with our world-view, call it \" physi-cal \", call it \" metaphysical \"; it makes no difference. So too (and thisstatement is an analogy) was positing caloric in the eighteenth cen- tury. That was not a bold, analogical conjecture. It was, by that time,simply the obvious theory to promote. Such a hypothesis enjoyed, atthat time, the fullest measure of scientic approbation and naturalness.It was, that is to say, fully in keeping with the then-current physical /metaphysical world-view. Thus we nd Joseph Black (1728-99), for one, arguing explicitly against Bacon 's ' dynamic ' theory, rst on the grounds that it was 15counterintuitive, and second, on the grounds that it was contrary toexperimental ndings: I cannot for m to myself a conception of this internal tremor, that has any tendency to explain, even the more simple effectsof heat, or those phenomena which indicate its presence in abody; and I think that Lord V rulam [Bacon] and his followers e have been contented with very slight resemblances indeed,between those most simple effects of heat, and the legitimate \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 15. I will have more to say in chapter 6 (p. 105) about the role of so-called intuitions in infor ming our world-views.Underdeter minism ( I ) 63 consequences of a tremulous motion. I also see many cases, in which intense heat is produced in this way, but where I am cer-tain that the internal tremor is incomparably less than in othercases of percussion, similar in all other respects. Thus theblows, which make a piece of soft iron intensely hot, produceno [appreciable] heat in a similar piece of very elastic steel.([30], 32-3) Black has here raised what he regards as a crucial objection to Bacon 's theory: if heat were motion, then in hammering equally twodifferent pieces of iron, one soft and one elastic, the two pieces of ironshould heat up equally. But they do not. Therefore, Black suggests,the theory that heat is motion is refuted. In hindsight, living in an age where the dynamic (kinetic) theory has supplanted the caloric theory, and where the dynamic theory (inconjunction with quantum mechanics) can and does explain why somehammered materials heat up more than others, we may be inclined toregard Black 's ' refutation ' of the dynamic theory as disingenuous.But any such criticism would be anachronistic, in effect faulting Blackfor not having foreseen the subsequent development of science. Black, like most eighteenth-century physicists, strongly preferred the caloric theory to - what he regarded as - Bacon 's insupportable,vibrational theory. But one year before Black 's death, Count Rumfordread a paper (25 January 1798) before the Royal Society of London,describing a series of experiments which, some fty years later, cameto be regarded as strong evidence of the correctness of the vibrationaltheory and of the inadequacy of the caloric theory. But at the time, atthe end of the eighteenth century and through much of the rst half ofthe nineteenth, Rumford 's experiments were either dismissed or theirresults believed to be accountable for within the prevailing calorictheory. Rumford 's name at birth had been \" Benjamin Thompson \". He was bor n in 1753 in Massachusetts, which was then still a colony ofEngland. When the revolutionary war came, Thompson remained aloyalist, and when the British ar my evacuated Boston in 1776, hesailed for Europe. Although he was to maintain a correspondence withpersons in America, and was to donate generous sums for scienticresearch there, he never retur ned. On the Continent, Thompsonentered the service of the Elector of Bavaria, and in due coursebecame the minister of war, gaining the title \" Count Rumford \" in1791. In his capacity as minister of war, he became the superintendent64 Beyond Experience of the military arsenal in Munich. And it was there that he undertook his most famous experiments on heat. Being engaged lately in superintending the boring of cannon ..., I was struck with the very considerable degree of Heatwhich a brass gun acquires in a short time in being bored, andwith the still more intense Heat (much greater than that of boil-ing water, as I found by experiment) of the metallic chipsseparated from it by the borer. ... whence comes the Heat actually produced in the mechani- cal operation above mentioned? Is it furnished by the metallic chips which are separated by the borer from the solid mass of metal? If this were the case, then, according to the moder n doctrines of latent Heat, and of caloric, the capacity for Heat of the parts of the metal, so reduced to chips, ought not only to be changed,but the change undergone by them should be sufciently greatto account for all the Heat produced. But no such change had taken place. ([176], 4-5) Rumford begins by examining one possible hypothesis the calorists might have offered for the rise in temperature: the heat is being gen-erated by pulverizing the metal. The idea here is that the total amountof heat in a large block of metal is greater than that in its smaller parts,and that in reducing the original to chips and shavings, the ' surplus 'heat of the whole is released. But Rumford then reports on an experi-ment in which he compares the amount of heat furnished to a givenmass of shavings and an equal mass of metal strips (taken from thesame original block of brass), by submerging them rst into boilingwater and then into cold water to see how much heat each absorbsfrom the hot water and how much each in tur n releases to the coldwater. He nds no appreciable difference between the shavings andthe larger strips. These initial results, even if they hardly constitute denitive dis- proof of the caloric theory, are interpreted by Rumford as evidencethat there is something seriously amiss in that theory. He begins tobelieve that the heat being generated is not anything ' latent ' in thecannon itself, but is coming about through the conversion of themechanical energy needed to tur n the machinery. In short, Rumfordnow strongly suspects that heat is not a kind of fluid, but is, in hisUnderdeter minism ( I ) 65 words, ' excited by friction '. But how can he prove any of this? Rumford then undertakes a series of four further experiments: (1) to measure quantitatively the amount of heat produced by friction (takingthe precaution of insulating his apparatus); (2) to determine what theeffect of excluding air would be (he nds none); (3) to see what effectthere would be if the apparatus were surrounded with a water jacket(the water rises in temperature and eventually boils [see p. 5 above]);and (4) to test whether lling the bore with water will change theresults (he nds that it does not). With these further experiments inhand, his conclusions are uncompromising: What is Heat? ... Is there anything that can with propriety be called caloric? W have seen that a very considerable quantity of Heat maye be excited in the friction of two metallic surfaces, and given offin a constant stream or flux in all directions without interrup- tion or intermission, and without any sign of diminution or ex-haustion. From whence came the Heat which was continually given off in this manner in the foregoing experiments? W s it furnished a by the small particles of metal, detached from the larger solidmasses, on their being rubbed together? This, as we have al-ready seen, could not possibly have been the case. W s it furnished by the air? This could not have been thea case; for, in three of the experiments, the machinery being keptimmersed in water, the access of the air of the atmosphere wascompletely prevented. W s it furnished by the water which surrounded thea machinery? That this could not have been the case is evident:rst, because this water was continually receiving Heat from the machinery, and could not at the same time be giving to , and receiving Heat from , the same body; and, secondly , because there was no chemical decomposition of any part of this water.... Is it possible that the Heat could have been supplied by means of the iron bar to the end of which the blunt steel borerwas xed? or by the small neck of the gun-metal by which thehollow cylinder was united to the cannon? These suppositionsappear more improbable even than either of those before men-tioned; for Heat was continually going off, or out of the machin-66 Beyond Experience ery, by both these passages, during the whole time the experi- ment lasted. And, in reasoning on this subject, we must not forget to con- sider that most remarkable circumstance, that the source of theHeat generated by friction, in these experiments, appeared evi-dently to be inexhaustible . It is hardly necessary to add, that anything which any insu- lated body, or system of bodies, can continue to furnish without limitation , cannot possibly be a material substance; and it ap- pears to me to be extremely difcult, if not quite impossible, tofor m any distinct idea of anything capable of being excited andcommunicated in the manner Heat was excited and communi-cated in these experiments, except it be M O T I O N. ([176], 20-2) It is interesting to compare the similarity of phrases, but the diametrically opposed views of Black and of Rumford, concer ning thevery possibility of entertaining the other 's point of view. Black: \" Icannot for m to myself a conception of this internal tremor, that hasany tendency to explain, even the more simple effects of heat. \" AndRumford: \" it appears to me to be extremely difcult, if not quiteimpossible, to for m any distinct idea of anything capable of beingexcited and communicated in the manner Heat was excited and com-municated in these experiments, except it be motion. \" Two eminentscientists, writing at virtually the same time, are incapable - each con-fesses - of being able to subscribe to the opposing theory. F r the half-century following the publication of his experiments,o Rumford 's conclusion - that heat is a for m of motion - was not onlynot accepted, it was positively and actively rebutted by calorists. Hisopponents were not crank scientists, but were among the best of theirday. On 5 June 1801 William Henry read a paper (actually written two years earlier, almost immediately after Rumford rst made his experi-ments public) to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, inwhich he raised serious objection to Rumford 's theory: \" ... the Counthas observed that water could not, at the same instant, be in the act ofgiving out and receiving heat. ... But I cannot admit that the argumentis demonstrative, in proving the evolved caloric not to be derived fromexternal substances; for no absurdity is implied in supposing, that abody may be receiving caloric in one state, and giving it out inanother \" ([92], 606-7). Even as late as Rumford had readUnderdeter minism ( I ) 67 his rst paper to the Royal Society, we can still nd strenuous defenses of the caloric theory. Thomas Traill, the editor of the eighthedition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , undertook himself to write the article on Heat in which he explicitly argued against the vibratorytheory. The other opinion, which has been maintained by Bacon, 16Boyle, and several other philosophers, considers heat as a mere quality of matter, and ascribes it to a vibratory movementamong the intimate particles of bodies; an idea which wasadopted by Rumford to explain his curious experiments on theexcitation and communication of heat by friction. This opinion,however, seems vague and unsatisfactory. If we say that heat ismotion amongst the particles of matter, still we have no expla-nation of the manner in which this motion is produced; for wecannot conceive any movement without an impulse, nor an im-pulse without material agent. ... [If heat were to] consist invibrations or motions of the particles of other matter, it shouldpervade elastic bodies with the greatest celerity; which weknow not to be the fact. ... If we mingle together equal quan-tities of water at different temperatures, the resulting tempera-ture will be an exact mean between the extremes. But if heatconsisted in such vibrations, there ought to have been a loss ofheat, as in all other communicated motions. ... Still more dif-cult is it to conceive how a permanent temperature could sub-sist among a great system of bodies, as the planets, if heat werenothing more than a vibration of the particles of bodies; for theoriginal impulse ought to diminish with each communication.([205], 260) Among a variety of other objections, we can see here that Traill musters some strong counterevidence to Rumford 's theory. Heat issupposed, on Rumford 's theory, to be an internal mechanical vibrationof a physical object. It presumably, then, ought to be conductedthrough physical objects with the same speed that mechanical im- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16. It is surprising to lear n that the very ter m \" scientist \" is of very recent origin, having been coined by William Whewell (1794-1866) in 1840 (seeMedawar [134], 9). As we can see, it had not achieved universal adoption by1856.68 Beyond Experience pulses are transmitted through those objects. In steel, for example, mechanical impulses are transmitted at the speed of 4975 m / sec. W re e you, then, to rap one end of a meter-long steel rod sharply, you wouldfeel the impulse at the other end 0.0002 sec (two ten-thousandths of asecond) later, i.e. virtually instantaneously. But were you, graspingone end of that same rod, to plunge the other into a re, it would takesome appreciable time, several minutes perhaps, before the end inyour hand would grow noticeably war m. Rumford 's theory, we can see, met with opposition for a variety of reasons, not least because it did not offer a quantitative account of the nature of heat. Moreover, his theory seemed to contradict, withoutexplanation, certain fundamentals of mechanics, the most basic andrespected scientic theory of the day. But even that was not the end ofit. F r as Henry points out, it rested on certain quite unproven presup-o positions, e.g. that a body could not be simultaneously gaining andlosing caloric. Such assumptions, while they might have commendedthemselves with virtual a priori certainty to Rumford, were not in factdemonstrated by experiment or grounded in any theory accepted atthat time, and were not nearly so ' self-evident ' to Henry or othercalorists. The remarkable French philosopher-scientist-historian Pierre Du- hem, writing in 1906, offered this perspective on such disputes. Now it may be good sense that permits us to decide between two physicists. It may be that we do not approve of the hastewith which the second one upsets the principles of a vast andharmoniously constructed theory whereas a modication ofdetail, a slight correction, would have sufced to put these the-ories in accord with the facts. On the other hand, it may be thatwe may nd it childish and unreasonable for the rst physicistto maintain obstinately at any cost, at the price of continualrepairs and many tangled-up stays, the wor m-eaten columns ofa building tottering in every part, when by razing thosecolumns it would be possible to construct a simple, elegant, andsolid system. But these reasons of good sense do not impose themselves with the same implacable rigor that the prescriptions of logicdo. There is something vague and uncertain about them; theydo not reveal themselves at the same time with the same degreeof clarity to all minds. Hence, the possibility of lengthy quarrelsbetween the adherents of an old system and the partisans of aUnderdeter minism ( I ) 69 new doctrine, each camp claiming to have good sense on its side, each party nding the reasons of the adversary inadequate.([60], 217) 4.5 The ineliminability of unproved presuppositionsThe ensuing debate between the two schools of scientists - the kineticists (as they were eventually to be called) and the calorists -is not atypical. Quite the contrary: the sort of dispute we have seen inthis instance has occurred, and will continue to occur, frequently inscience. Controversies about scientic theories and the degree towhich any given theory is conr med or disconr med by experimentand observation are inevitable; they are, in fact, virtually mandated bycertain logical principles. The testing of scientic theories is not at all the straightforward, unambiguous, procedure it has often, historically, been portrayed tobe. An experiment, and its overarching theory, which may be utterlyconvincing to one scientist, may be just as unconvincing to another.Such differences are not usually to be accounted for in ter ms of stub-bor nness, intellectual blindness, dishonesty, conservatism, or the like.Disputes between scientists usually arise, not because of psychologi-cal differences between personalities, but because of important prin-ciples at play in the logic of subjecting scientic theories to empirical testing. It can be proven - relatively easily as a matter of fact - that for any set of data about the world (i.e. for any set of contingent* data), theremust exist logically independent alter native sets of explanations forthat data, indeed there are an innite number of such alter native sets.Intuitively, in less technical vocabulary, this means that the ' t 'between theories and experimental and observational data is remark-ably ' loose ', and that for any proposed theory or explanation of a phe-nomenon, there must, theoretically, exist alter native theories or expla-nations which are compatible with the data. This is not to say, ofcourse, that all such alter native explanations are equally probable orthat they are equally attractive to us. The point is that experiment andobservation are never themselves sufcient to eliminate all possiblecontenders among alter native explanations. Rumford 's conclusions were not convincing to his critics. The calorists had no difculty whatsoever in homing in on all sorts ofunproven presuppositions in his arguments. Clearly, Rumford 's con-clusions survived or floundered upon the correctness or incorrectness70 Beyond Experience of these many, many presuppositions. But he was not in a position to test these presuppositions. Had he attempted that, his experimentingcould have gone on forever. The presuppositions we must bring to any of our experiments are virtually without limit, and there is no practical way of markedlyreducing their number. Even as simple an ' experiment ' as measuring aroom for a carpet is encumbered, we nd, by vast numbers of untestedpresuppositions. What sorts of presuppositions must be true for ourmeasurements of the floor area to be correct? Our tape measures mustbe accurate; the walls of the room must meet at right angles, or, if not,we must have some means for measuring those angles; our tapemeasures must not change length as we move about in space; the areaof the room must be calculable by some known formula; measure-ments of length must be independent of the time of day; the visualappearance of the room must have certain known relationships to itsphysical layout; etc. W re we to put some of these presuppositions e themselves to the test, those very tests would themselves, in their tur n,carry a number of untested presuppositions. F r example, were we to o test the angles of the walls, we should then have to ask whether ourmeasuring instruments were accurate. How shall we test them? By using still other instruments. But what about the latter? W are faced e with the potential of an innite regress of presuppositions which it isimpossible to complete. Throughout the greater part of the twentieth century, and to a greater degree than any of his contemporaries, Karl P pper empha- o sized the role, the ineliminability, and the potential inexhaustibility ofuntested presuppositions in our doing of science. At rst, the very ex-istence of such untested and ineliminable presuppositions may bethought to give the lie to, indeed to make utterly impossible, the claimthat science is ' objective '. But P pper argued that this pessimistic con- o clusion is not forced upon us. In his view, objectivity does not - andmore importantly, could not - consist in our being able to prove a theory to be true. The number of presuppositions in each of ourtheories seems to be without limit. They range from highly specicpresuppositions of particular theories, e.g. that no physical object cantake in and give off caloric at one and the same time, to the mostgeneral (often labeled \" metaphysical \") presuppositions which groundvirtually all our theories, e.g. that we will not wake up in an hour anddiscover that what we have taken to be reality was in fact nothing buta dream. If objectivity consisted in being able to prove a theory true,Underdeter minism ( I ) 71 and if proving a theory true involved proving that every presupposi- tion of that theory is true, then simply because the latter - proving thepresuppositions true - would be an innite task, nothing could bedeemed to be objective. P pper 's reply to this - one which I think is o fundamentally sound - was to argue that this latter conception of ob-jectivity is useless. It is useless because it never could apply to any-thing. Instead P pper urged that we conceive of objectivity, not as an o accomplishment , but rather as an attitude: a critical frame of mind. Scientists are objective, not if they attend open-mindedly to their dataand let it ' dictate ' the theory, but rather if they admit to their presup-positions and recognize that their conclusions rest on those presuppo-sitions and if they do not try to prejudge a priori or dogmatically whatfurther tests of those presuppositions might reveal. The logic of testing scientic theories is important, for illustrative purposes, because it is, as well, the logic of testing any theories, not just scientic, but the most mundane through to the most ' metaphysi-cal '. There is no logic special or unique to the sciences. The logic oftheory testing is the same for the child in her crib theorizing about thepersistence of unperceived objects as it is for an adult theorizing aboutthe efcacy of using a tape measure to t a room for a carpet, as it isfor the scientist theorizing about the nature of heat, and as it is for themetaphysician theorizing about the nature of space and time. Whatmay differ is the degree to which the theorizing lends itself to empiri-cal testing. But the logic is the same throughout, and the possibility ofconclusive proof is not to be realized: there are only degrees of prob-ability (about which - incidentally - there are enormous differences ofopinion among researchers in the philosophy of logic). T be sure, we do not actively entertain all, or even many, of the o innite number of potentially confounding factors when we proceed todo something as commonplace as measuring a room. But it is equallyclear that these factors must be as we just described, if we are to have success. Only if, for example, tape measures do not change length aswe move about the room, can our measuring the room work. As we goabout our lives, doing what we commonly do, searching for misplacedscissors, measuring rooms, cooking meals, driving cars, tur ning onradios, etc., we do so in a context of making untold numbers of un-proven assumptions. Y u may seem to recall having had a glass of o milk last night. But how good is your memory? Is it perfect? Couldn 'tsomebody have substituted soybean extract which you mistook formilk? Etc.72 Beyond Experience The point is the same when it comes to doing science, only the degree of uncertainty of the presuppositions is greater. Y u may rea- o sonably be sure (but ought you to be utterly convinced?) that thewalls of your room are square; but what, if anything, entitled Rumfordto his - unproven - belief that an object could not simultaneously gainand lose caloric? What warranted his unproven belief that caloriccould not be communicated to his apparatus by means other than thosehe had examined? Simply: he was not justied in these beliefs. Heheld them because - taken with his theory - they seemed to him toprovide a better explanation of what was going on than did the com-peting caloric theory. But these very presuppositions did not seemcompelling, indeed seemed false, to other equally rational scientists,the calorists. Identical claims may be made for the practice of metaphysical theorizing. In metaphysics - just like commonplace theorizing, andjust like scientic theorizing - theories are underdetermined by empir-ical data. W cannot prove that the world did not spring into existence e ten minutes ago complete with fossil records, libraries, adult humanbeings with (apparent) memories, etc. But we theorize that such didnot happen, and we do so because an alter native theory seems to workbetter. But there is nothing that can be regarded as a conclusive test ofthe truth of either theory. Some philosophers and a somewhat greater number of cognitive scientists, however, have tried to take the sting out of underdeter-minism by arguing that although there are potentially, from a logical point of view, an innite number of different explanations of anygiven phenomenon, there are generally only a very few alter nativeexplanations psychologically available. They will often cite in these arguments the fact that until Einstein 's physics appeared, there was nogood or reasonable alter native to Newtonian mechanics; that evennow there are not many, if any, contenders against Einstein 's specialtheory of relativity; and that there are few, if any, challengers to quan-tum mechanics. But the trouble with this defense and its complacentattitude about the possibility of underdeterminism is familiar: itfocuses on too few examples taken from but one highly specializedarea of human knowledge. What is, as we have seen, at best only ahalf-truth* about physics is surely not true of other areas of humaninterest. When we look outside of physics, we often do not nddominant, relatively unchallenged theories. Often we will nd many,sometimes a bewildering variety of, alter native theories offered asanswers to some of our most interesting and pressing concer ns.Underdeter minism ( I ) 73 What is the concept of causality ? What are rights and obligations? How are we to recognize and / or agree to them? What is a person?How is knowledge possible?What is a mind?What is a soul?Is there purpose in the universe?Does God exist?What are beliefs?How does language work?Can the language of science be translated into the language of logic? T what extent is the atmosphere able to absorb industrial pol-o lutants? Of what kinds? How shall \" gross national product \" be dened?Is punishment morally justied?Does free will exist?What makes a particular piece of art worthy or good?Is intelligence a meaningful concept and, if so, can intelligence be measured in a society-independent manner? Is a value-free science possible?Are there historical forces?How best should a society protect minority rights?What moral justication is there for limiting immigration?Do animals have rights?Do males and females differ in their ability to do mathematics?Etc. Directing attention to just the rst of this list, to the question regarding the analysis of causality , we nd not just one, or even just a few, but a very great number of theories. One recent author ([94], 14-21) lists tencontemporary theories. And even at that, his list is incomplete. Having a plethora of alter native theories, far from being ' psycho- logically unlikely ', is in fact the nor m. Underdeterminism is not just alogical possibility. It is in fact one of the most pervasive features ofour attempts to make sense of the world. All of our theorizing, withoutexception, whether in science, philosophy, jurisprudence, etc., isunderdetermined by the empirical data. W can never hope to ' read e the truth off the world ' as it were. All we can ever hope to do is topropose theories to try to make sense of the flood of data and to work74 Beyond Experience at trying to improve these theories and to replace theories with better ones. If we do not recognize the underdeterminism in our theories,then we will unwittingly become dogmatists thinking all the while thatwe ' have seen the truth '. Truth there well may be. But human beings, unfortunately, have no privileged access to truth when we try to construct scientic and phi-losophical theories about the world. In generating and adopting suchtheories there is for us no other method than the dialectical one of 17trial, error, trial, error, ... \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 17. Lear ning that a hypothesis is false rarely ends our trials. Our interest lies with highly specic hypotheses, ones which have what is called a high' infor mation content '. On a scale of 0.00 to 1.00, we desire hypotheses withinfor mation content close to 1.00 (see e.g. [34], 370-81). Lear ning that ahypothesis which has high infor mational content (e.g. 0.998) is in error is tolear n the truth of a proposition whose infor mational content is very low (e.g.0.002). F r example, you may guess (hypothesize) that my telephone numbero is 555-9993. Y u put this hypothesis to a test (trial) and lear n that it is false. o Y u now have lear ned something true alright, but its infor mational content,o and its practical value to you, is virtually nil. Inasmuch as there are - in prin-ciple - 10 million different 7-digit telephone numbers, lear ning (the truth)that 555-9993 is not my telephone number puts you only one ten-millionth closer to nding out what my telephone number actually is. Discovering thata hypothesis is false may be useful as a goad to further hypothesizing; but itis, in general, no substitute for lear ning that a hypothesis has withstoodfalsifying and may, therefore, be true.C H A P T E R F I V E Underdeter minism ( I I ) In the previous chapter I have discussed how Nature does not offer up its secrets willingly, how it requires creativity and imagination to ndhypotheses which are useful for explaining and predicting the way theworld is, and how it is possible for rational persons to disagree aboutthe merits of a hypothesis. In this chapter I want to explore an exten-sion of those issues, but here my reflections are considerably morespeculative than those preceding. What follows below is not so muchan argument whose soundness seems clear to me, but a series ofworries and concer ns, in a way, an expression of disquiet I have aboutsome of the metaphysical assumptions underlying certain contem-porary scientic research. These sanguine, common assumptions maybe methodologically justied. However, it is far from clear that empir- ical evidence supports them in any strong way, and at the very leastthey deserve closer scrutiny than they usually have elicited. 5.1 Human historyWhen I was a high-school student studying algebra and geometry, I found those subjects so straightforward, so intuitive (if you will permitme to describe them that way), in short, so easy, that I fantasized thathad they not already been created, I myself could have invented themwith some hard work. The self-delusion continued. In university, Ibelieved that I, too, could have found for myself many of the tricksmathematicians had discovered at the tur n of the twentieth century forsolving differential equations. But with additional lear ning, particular-ly in studying the history of mathematics and science, I came, in duecourse, to realize what an extraordinary hubris I had been suffering. I am sure that the cause of my exaggerated belief in my own abilities had a good deal to do with the kind of education I had beengiven in high school, a kind of education which, so far as I can tell, inlooking at contemporary textbooks and in talking with my studentsand with my children, is still the nor m. The trouble, as I said earlier, is76 Beyond Experience that moder n textbooks typically avoid controversy. They ignore the route by which thinkers struggle to reach their hypotheses. W rst of o all, textbooks usually are silent about, or simply dismiss as havingbeen ' proven wrong ', the successions of abandoned theories strewn onthe wayside along the road to current theories. If history teaches usanything, it is that many current theories will themselves in due coursebe superseded. T o little is made of this point in ordinary classroom o teaching. So much of mathematics and science is presented to students as ' fact ', as fait accompli , as natural and as certain, that it takes on an almost irresistible appearance of inevitableness. \" Y s, of course; e clearly it can be seen that that is the way the world is \", students mayall too easily be beguiled into thinking as they are presented with aseemingly nished science. Students are led to believe that virtuallyall the work has been done, only the mopping-up details remain. I remember myself what a shock it was, and what at the same time an illuminating lesson it was, to lear n of the history of the invention ofwhat I - from our moder n perspective - regarded as so ' obvious ' thatat rst I could hardly believe that there was ever a time when human-kind lacked the concept: a symbol for the number zero. But historytells us that not only was the symbol late in coming, so too was thevery concept of zero 's being a number. Using a symbol for zero was amonumental breakthrough in the history of mathematics. But it tookgenerations of mathematicians laboring away at arithmetic before asymbol for zero came to be widely adopted; so too for representingnumbers themselves with digits whose place indicated powers of a so-called base. Notice that in antique Roman numerals, the symbol,for example, for the number eight \" V I I I \" is twice as long as that for nine \" I X \" and four times as long as that for one hundred \" C \". In moder n (Hindu-Arabic) notation, no number has a longer symbolicrepresentation than a larger number, but this ' obvious ', and exceed-ingly useful (for computational purposes), device took thousands of years to emerge. Having been reared on it, we take it to be ' natural '.But it is not ' natural ', it was not there in Nature to be ' read off '; itwas an invention of genius. And we flatter ourselves in the extreme ifwe think that any ordinary one of us could have or would have in-vented it had we not already found it in the world into which we werebor n. 1It took more than three billion years for life on this planet to evolve from the bacterial for m to a primate. That it did run this course seems \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 91. 1 billion = 1,000,000,000 = 10 .Underdeter minism ( I I ) 77 to border on the miraculous, for it is easy to imagine any number of ' accidents ' which could have prevented it. Recall, the dinosaurs diedout. But conditions suitable for the emergence of a primate are onlypart of the story. That human beings, intelligent, rational, language-using, symbol- using creatures who have invented mathematics, physics, chemistry,have tamed the Earth and the seas and the air, should exist at all is -just on the basis of probability - tantamount to a miracle: a miracle ofblind Nature or a miracle ordained by God, but a miracle in eithercase. But once there walks on the face of the planet an intelligent, lan-guage-using creature, what happens next? From the evidence, theanswer seems to be: not much. The greatest part of human history,save for the last few thousand years, seems pretty much of a piece.Only comparatively recently did human beings plant and irrigateelds, create cities, track the stars, count and multiply, rene ores, andteach themselves to read and write. As anthropologists have spread out across the globe they have dis- covered ' primitive ' or ' stone age ' tribes living here and there, inpockets isolated from civilization, subsisting as did our common an-cestors of tens of thousands of years ago. These primitive tribes hadnot enjoyed (if that is the right description) the progress of most ofEuropean and Asian societies. Some of these tribes, at the time of theirdiscovery, had not yet reached the invention of the wheel. Most hadno written language. Many had not lear ned to craft metals. Someknew little or nothing of agriculture or animal husbandry and survivedby hunting and gathering. The point is that human progress should not be regarded as a his- torical inevitability. It takes the right ecological conditions, of course.But it also requires something more: it requires an act of creativity,either technological (making a wheel, hammering metal, melting sand,etc.) or intellectual (placing a symbol - on a cave wall, or clay tablet,or on some such thing - of not just a scene but an idea or a fact, inventing words for abstract concepts [ one, two], etc.). There is noth- ing inevitable about the occurrence of such breakthroughs. They may,but they need not, occur. The primitive tribes which have survivedinto the atomic age are evidence that these breakthroughs need notoccur. Had these tribes not been discovered by explorers from civi-lization, one might speculate, not unreasonably, that they might havepersisted in their static state indenitely, perhaps for tens of thousandsof years more, perhaps, even, forever. Science, mathematics, philosophy, music, technology, medicine, commerce, etc. are all products of the creative genius of countless per-78 Beyond Experience sons whose names have been forever lost to us. W shall never know e the name of the man or woman who rst attached a sharpened rock toa wooden shaft, or created a bow and arrow, or tried to write a sen-tence, or carried a bunch of counting stones to reckon numbers with,or deliberately lit a re, etc. There is no inevitableness in our having an arithmetic, in our having a geometry (many of them in fact), in our having calculus, in ourhaving physics, chemistry, or biology. There is no inevitableness,either, in our formulating theories of personhood, in our codifyinglogics, in our exploring the bases of morality, or in our wonderingabout the validity of our senses. Science and philosophy both - likemusic - are the products of creative imagination. There was no moreinevitability in humankind 's enjoying Newtonian physics than therewas in its being the beneciary of Beethoven 's creative genius. P rsons who study political history see certain kinds of events, suche as wars, movements of populations, and political alliances, constantlyrepeated. F cusing on these sorts of phenomena one might well come o to believe that there is a certain inevitability in history. Certain kindsof events are ' destined ' to occur, not just once but time and timeagain. But focusing on intellectual history, an entirely different sort of pic- ture emerges. Here there is not repetition but novelty. Here there is notinevitability, but uniqueness, creativity, imagination, and genius. Itwas not inevitable that a number system would evolve; it was not in-evitable that grammarians would appear; it was not inevitable thathumankind would gure out the relationship between the sides of tri-angles in a Euclidean space; it was not inevitable that humankindwould gure out the relationship between the sides of triangles innon-Euclidean spaces; it was not inevitable that Locke (chapter 6)would concer n himself about the personality of a prince being trans-ferred into the body of a cobbler; it was not inevitable that Bachwould write the Chaconne; it was not inevitable that Newton wouldinvent the concept of mass. F r too much has been made of a few cases where one piece ofa goods, either a material invention or an intellectual invention, wassimultaneously created by two or more persons. Cases often cited areNewton 's and Leibniz 's independent invention of the calculus; Edi-son 's and Cros 's invention of the phonograph; Benz 's and Daimler 'sinvention of the gasoline engine; Gauss 's and Lobachevsky 's I I ) 79 Non-Euclidean geometries arose out of a critical examination of Euclid 's geometry created some two thousand years earlier. It took,that is, two thousand years before Euclid 's geometry was understoodwell enough so that variants became possible. But if it took that longjust to understand Euclid 's geometry, is it reasonable to suppose that someone or other, other than Euclid, would have invented his geome-try had he not done so? The very fact that it took so long to create anon-Euclidean geometry attests, I would like to suggest, not so muchto the inevitability of someone 's creating that geometry, but instead tothe extraordinary intellectual novelty it was. If the creating of geome-tries were anything like being ' obvious ', non-Euclidean geometriesshould have occurred not in the nineteenth century A D, but in the rst century B C. Then, too, although Leibniz may be regarded as the co- inventor of the calculus, there is nothing in history to suggest that he,or any contemporary, was simultaneously co-inventing mechanicsalong with Newton. Leibniz had not conceived of mass; Leibniz had not conceived of the planet Earth accelerating toward a falling body;Leibniz had not conceived of universal* gravitation; and Leibniz hadnot conceived that for every action there was an equal and oppositereaction. There are also a few cases cited within biology itself, not just within recent human intellectual development, which have been used to arguefor a certain goal-directedness operative in Nature. The phenomenonof so-called ' convergent ' evolution (along very different phylogeneticpaths) of, for example, the eye of the mammal and the eye of theoctopus has sometimes been offered as evidence of goal-directednessin evolution. (See, for example, [80], 198.) And from the suppositionof this directedness, it has been further argued that evolution wouldprobably (or inevitably) produce a creature whose mathematics andphysics would resemble ours. But forbidding problems are found inthis argument when it is dissected. First is the fact that convergentevolution is a relatively rare phenomenon, providing only weakevidence - at best - of a goal-directedness in evolution itself. Secondis the fact that even if one were to posit a goal-directedness in evolu-tion as an explanation of convergent evolution, that goal-directednesswould be toward the development of similar physiological structures.It is only on an analogy that one moves beyond a goal-directedness of physiological structure to a goal-directedness of rational thought. F r- o mally, i.e. its particular content aside, the argument thus begins withciting a fact about a relatively rare phenomenon and then proceeds in aseries of steps each of which is itself of signicantly low probability.80 Beyond Experience The cumulative effect is to make the probability which the factual premise confers on its speculative conclusion no more than verysmall. It is one thing to argue that something could be so (i.e. has a nonzero probability) and quite another to provide solid grounds forbelieving it is so (i.e. has a high probability [greater than 50%]). In short, the argument - which moves from the detected similarities inphysiology between the octopus eye and the mammalian eye to theconclusion of the inevitableness of someone or other producing thegeometry and physics of Euclid and Newton - is far too weak to jus- 2tify its conclusion. Neither occasional instances of co-invention nor irregular occur- rences of convergent evolution provide a strong base on which to posita goal-directedness or historical determinism in Nature pointing to-ward the probable (still less the inevitable) unfolding of our own par-ticular intellectual history. 5.2 Listening and probing for extraterrestrial intelligenceOnce humankind had reconciled itself to the fact that the Earth is not the center of the universe, that not even the Sun is the center of theuniverse, that there are billions of galaxies in the vastness of the uni-verse, and each galaxy in its tur n contains billions of planets, the ques-tion naturally arises: Is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe?In the last thirty years, centuries of speculation have at last tur ned intoactive empirical research. The United States gover nment has fromtime to time funded the program S E T I (Search for Extra-T rrestrial In- e 3telligence) (albeit sometimes unwittingly ) and has even lofted (1972) into the heavens, on a flight beyond the solar system, a gold-anodizedaluminum plate bearing an engraving of a man and a woman alongwith a (crude) star map of Earth 's position among the planets orbitingthe Sun. The hope motivating this project has been that somewhere,some time, this disk might be intercepted by alien intelligences andsomething of our own appearance and accomplishments would then \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. F r more on convergent evolution and the emergence of intelligence, seeo Mayr [133], 28, and Raup [166], 35-7. 3. In 1978 Congress terminated funding for S E T I. N A S A, however, continued S E T I without publicity under its exobiology* program, spending $1.5 million on S E T I in 1980-1. But in 1981, Congress discovered the subterfuge and explicitly forbade any further expenditures by N A S A on S E T I ([190]).Underdeter minism ( I I ) 81 be made known beyond our own tiny speck of a planet. Radio tele- scopes - although not funded by N A S A - daily scan the skies searching among the countless sources of radio waves for some telltale traces ofan origin, not in some natural process, but in a deliberate, contrived,intelligent broadcast ([59], 70). But how reasonable is this hope that there is intelligent extrater- restrial life with whom we might communicate? The arguments moti-vating the moder n empirical search for such intelligent life conceal ahost of metaphysical assumptions worthy of close philosophical scru-tiny. It is notoriously difcult to assign a probability to the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. And I must confess to being mildlybemused by the attempts other persons have made to actually calculatethe probability of there being intelligent life elsewhere in the uni- 4verse. The assumptions on which these calculations are based seem tome to be so tenuous and so numerous as to undermine any reasonable-ness whatever of the conclusions reached. I, for one, nd it premature,at the current level of scientic knowledge, to try to assign a numeri-cal value to the probability of intelligent life arising in a waterless orcarbonless world. What conditions are necessary for life? Certainlythose on Earth have proved ideal. But how far can conditions depart 5before life of any for m is physically impossible? Is water needed? Iscarbon needed? Is starlight (sunlight) needed or might the radiatingheat of a planet 's molten core do as a substitute? What temperaturerange? What atmosphere, etc.? It is altogether improbable that evolution on other planets will have produced a human being. Intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. The standard approach to this problem is currently via the Drake equation (see e.g. [80], 345-51), devised by the astronomer Frank Drake. Carl Sagangives a slightly variant version ([183], 12-24). T pically, the probability of y there being civilizations in our own galaxy with whom we can now commun-icate is gured as the product of several independent factors, usually seven inall, including such things as the fraction of planets per planetary systemhaving conditions ecologically suitable for the evolution of life, the fractionof planets where life actually develops, and the fraction where life progressesto the stage of technology. 5. F r a detailed examination and criticism of the assumptions made by ex-o obiologists and cosmologists in trying to determine the numerical values ofthe ter ms in the Drake equation, see [129], esp. 80-6.82 Beyond Experience almost certainly, will be nonhuman. These nonhumans may lack eyes or have light-sensitive organs very different from our own; they maylack ears or have auditory organs quite unlike ours; they may havesenses we lack; they may lack senses we have; their emotionalresponses may be very dissimilar to our own, perhaps even incom- 6prehensible to us; etc. What - given all these myriads of possible dif-ferences in our biologies - can we expect to share in common? Whatsubject matter should we choose when we try to establish communica-tion? How shall we communicate with an alien life-for m? Steven Spielberg gave one answer, of a sort, in his lm Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Many newspaper and magazine reviews of the movie were extravagant in their praise of Spielberg 'susing music as the medium for communication between aliens andourselves. But as one thinks about it critically, surely the praise forthat particular aspect of the lm is undeserved. Music is hardly a uni-versal medium for communication. It is certainly not a language:while it may evoke emotions, it cannot be used to state facts. But evenmore important, for our purposes, is the fact that music must, to a fargreater extent than a language, be tailored to t the peculiar biology ofa species. If we ever do succeed in making contact with the members of an alien civilization, we certainly would not expect to nd pianos in theirhomes. Pianos are designed in their keyboards and pedals to t theanatomy of a human being: ten ngers, two feet, and upright posture.And the piano 's equal tempering, i.e. being tuned in a certain fashion,indeed its even producing fundamental tones in the audible range of33 Hz to 4000 Hz, is tailored to the atmosphere of the Earth and the \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. F r a minority, dissenting, opinion, see Bieri [29]. The guiding assump-o tion of Bieri 's argument is that the actual route which evolution has followedon Earth is the route which would be followed on virtually any planet. Givensuch a premise, his conclusions are not improbable. But that initial assump-tion needs powerful independent justication, and Bieri does not offer it. Inits ner details, his argument is of this sort: \" Strong arguments can beadvanced for the presence of only two eyes for binocular vision and two earsfor binaural hearing \" ([29], 456). Unfortunately, Bieri leaves it at that; heoffers not even a hint as to what these \" strong arguments \" might be. And hegets more specic still, being convinced, for example, that humanoids onother planets will not have green skin (457). But again, he offers no argumentwhatsoever for his assertion.Underdeter minism ( I I ) 83 auditory mechanism of human beings. W can expect few, if any, of e these necessary* conditions for our having created a piano to be repli-cated on other planets. But even putting aside the purely physical means of producing music, ought we to expect the music itself of alien civilizations toresemble our own? I think there is no good reason to suppose that itwould. Given the inordinate number of factors which fuel the evolu-tion of a species, it strikes me as highly improbable that the nervoussystems of extraterrestrials would develop in a manner parallel to thatof human beings on Earth. It is far more likely that the aesthetic expe-riences of extraterrestrials, if indeed they have aesthetic experiences atall, would be totally inaccessible to ourselves. Aliens may not, forexample, be capable of sorting out the separate lines in a piece ofpolyphonic music, may be insensitive to color or to geometricalperspective, etc. Their own aesthetics, in tur n, may be as incom-prehensible and as unmoving to us as our own best accomplishments,e.g. Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel or Schubert 's String Quintet, ap-parently are to cats and dogs. But if our aesthetic goods are not to be exchanged with alien intel- ligences, might intellectual goods? Leaving Hollywood behind, andtur ning to the scientic and philosophical literature, we nd that manywriters do believe that there are at least some intellectual goods wewould share in common with any technologically advanced life-for ms: mathematics and science. The idea is that mathematics and sci-ence are ' objective ', that mathematics will be the same throughout theuniverse, and that science will be as well, provided, of course, in thislatter instance, that the laws of physics are the same throughout theuniverse. What, then, can we hope to communicate with any ' technologi- cal ' species? It appears that purely symbolic constructs whichcan be reduced to a postulational system, for example, mathe-matics (which might include much of physics as well as evenbasic rules of social organization), can be communicated.Surely a preliminary phase of communicating simple axioms toeducate the alien intelligence and let them educate us in basicconcepts is rst required. However, it seems unlikely that wecould share ideas which involve affect and emotions; for ex-ample we would be unable to communicate the feel rather thanthe abstract description of perceiving something. (Arbib [9],76)84 Beyond Experience Our main hope for interstellar communication is based on the belief that a technological civilization must have numbers. It ishard to conceive of a psychology which could do technologywithout being able to count, and add, and multiply. T do the o geometry necessary to describe the motion of planets it musthave some theory like conic sections or calculus. Thus onemight expect such things to be in the repertoire of a scientist inany technological culture. ... One might expect (thoughDrake 's ideas on neutron stars may suggest a counterexample)that Newton 's laws hold anywhere as a reasonable rst approx-imation, so that any scientist would eventually begin to recog-nize that you are talking about Newton 's laws. After a while,you have a language in which you can describe the motion ofparticles, no matter what the senses of the creature are, orwhether he perceives these motions by vision, x-ray, touch, oranother method. (Arbib [9], 77) Arbib 's optimism is based on a very great number of unarticulated presuppositions. Many of these I regard as highly dubious. I am not atall condent about the possibility of an alien life-for m, indeed anotherhuman being for that matter, understanding the symbolism of ourphysics without our already sharing a common natural language. Thatis, Arbib and many others who have promoted the search for extrater-restrial intelligence believe that two creatures who do not share a com-mon natural language can recognize, just by the passing back andforth of symbols, not only that the symbols are being used to expressscience and mathematics, but more specically that the science isNewtonian physics and the mathematics is ordinary arithmetic. Itstrikes me that altogether too much credit is being given to the powerof the message itself, and far too little to the need of a prior com-monality of the languages and thought-structures of the would-becommunicators. Suppose the tables were tur ned. Suppose it were we who were the recipients, rather than the senders, of such a message. The messagecontains a series of marks which we take to be written in an attempt toestablish communication by the senders instructing us in the rudi-ments of arithmetic and physics. The trouble is that there is no singleway, or even just a few ways, to axiomatize either arithmetic or New-tonian physics. Any number of different ways exist to axiomatizearithmetic, some doubtless containing concepts we have never evenUnderdeter minism ( I I ) 85 7imagined, perhaps even concepts which we are incapable of having. Similarly for Newtonian physics. Must one have a concept of mass,for example, to do Newtonian mechanics? W might at rst think so, e since that is the way it was taught to most of us. W have been taught e that there were, at its outset, three ' fundamental ' concepts of New-tonian mechanics: mass, length, and time. (A fourth, electric charge,was added in the nineteenth century.) But it is far from clear that thereis anything sacrosanct, privileged, necessary, or inevitable about thisparticular starting point. Some physicists in the nineteenth century' revised ' the conceptual basis of Newtonian mechanics and ' dened 'mass itself in ter ms of length alone (the French system), and others in 8ter ms of length together with time (the astronomical system). Themore important point is that it is by no means obvious that we wouldrecognize an alien 's version of ' Newtonian mechanics '. It is entirelyconceivable that aliens should have hit upon a radically different man-ner of calculating the acceleration of falling bodies, of calculating thepath of projectiles, of calculating the orbits of planets, etc., withoutusing our concepts of mass, length, and time, indeed without usingany, or very many, concepts we ourselves use. Their mathematics, too, may be unrecognizable. In the 1920s, two versions of quantum mechanics appeared: Schr \u00a8 dinger 's wave me- o chanics and Heisenberg 's matrix mechanics. These theories were eachpossible only because mathematicians had in previous generationsinvented algebras for dealing with wave equations and with matrices.But it is entirely possible that advanced civilizations on differentplanets might not invent both algebras: one might invent only an \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7. Again, see Thomas Nagel [140]. 8. James Maxwell (1831-79) introduces the topic by writing: \" W shall call e the unit of length [ L]. ... W shall call the concrete unit of time [ T]. ... W ee shall denote the concrete unit of mass by the symbol [ M] in treating of the dimensions of other units. The unit of mass will be taken as one of the threefundamental units \" ([132], 3-4). But then he immediately proceeds to explainthat it is not necessary to take mass as fundamental: \" When, as in the Frenchsystem, a particular substance, water, is taken as a standard of density, thenthe unit of mass is no longer independent, but varies as the unit of volume, or 3as [L ]. If, as in the astronomical system, the unit of mass is dened with 3 -2respect to its attractive power, the dimensions of [ M] are [L T ] \" ([132], 4). See also Lord Kelvin (William Thomson 1824-1907) [109].86 Beyond Experience algebra for wave equations, the other only a matrix algebra. W re they e to try to communicate their respective physics, one to the other, theywould meet with incomprehension: the receiving civilization wouldnot understand the mathematics, or even for that matter understandthat it was mathematics which was being transmitted. (Remember, theplan in S E T I is to send mathematical and physical infor mation before the communicating parties attempt to establish conversation throughnatural language.) Among our own intellectual accomplishments, wehappen to nd an actual example of two different algebras. Their veryexistence, however, points up the possibility of radically differentways of doing mathematics, and suggests (although does not of courseprove) that there may be other ways, even countless other ways, ofdoing mathematics, ways which we have not even begun to imagine,which are at least as different as are wave mechanics and matrix me-chanics. My point is not so much to worry about the possibility of our actually ever communicating with extraterrestrial intelligences, but toexpose the metaphysical presuppositions of the kinds of scientic,epistemological,* and metaphysical views which infor m much of thecurrent discussion. So very much of this contemporary discussionstrikes me as being premised on a naive view that mathematics andscience can be of only one sort and that any ' successful ' mathematicsor science must be recognizable as such and translatable into our own.These views, in their tur n, seem to me, ultimately, to be traceable backto the naive Baconian idea that Truth can be ' read off ' of Nature, thatultimately there can be only one science, because - once the hypothe-sizing and the testing are done - Truth will be manifest. I cannot provethat these moder n views are incorrect. But I am sure - and this is theimportant point - that they cannot be proven to be true. As a species, we are faced with something of a methodological dilemma. If we do not assume that communication is possible, if wedo not assume that mathematics and physics will be the same and willbe recognizable for other technologically advanced civilizations, thenwe shall never succeed in nding intelligent life elsewhere in the uni-verse by listening to radio signals. That is, these particular, unprovablemetaphysical assumptions are a necessary condition for our ndingwhat we seek. But they are not sufcient* conditions. They may bewildly wrong. There may be intelligent life in the universe which hasdevised mathematics and science, and has managed admirably to copewith its environment, in ways totally unimagined, indeed unimagin-able, to us. If so, we will not nd them with our technology. MakingUnderdeter minism ( I I ) 87 the assumption that mathematics, science, and technology will in- evitably and universally be recognizably similar to our own is ouronly route to success, just as our hoping that there is to be found (in-vented) a cure for cancer is our only hope of ever nding (inventing)such a cure. But the hope is no guarantee of success; it is merely apsychologically and politically necessary condition for getting on withthe job. I see no good reason to believe that if we ever manage to detect life on other planets (e.g. by manned or unmanned probes), then we willnd that the life-for ms there will have succeeded in replicating ourown history to the point where they too will have had a Newtonianrevolution. Quite the contrary, it strikes me that the probability ofother ' intelligent ' life-for ms throwing up a Newton is of the sameorder as their throwing up a Beethoven. I no more expect alien life-for ms to have duplicated our physics and mathematics than I expectsome one of them to have duplicated the W ldstein Sonata. And I seea no inevitability, either, in any other course of evolution ever produc-ing a Plato or an Aristotle or a Hume or a Kant. Galileo, Brahe, and Kepler paved the way for Newton. But it was Newton alone who made the breakthrough of conceiving not of theEarth attracting the falling object, but of both the Earth and the fallingobject attracting one another. No one before Newton ever imaginedthat an object 's falling and accelerating toward the Earth was recipro-cated by the Earth 's accelerating (but so minutely as to be impercep-tible) toward the falling object. This was no minor change in a long-standing theory. Newton 's rethinking the situation was breathtaking inits audacity. It was not even remotely to be conceived as being ' readoff ' of Nature. And it is by no means clear that anyone else ever would have replicated Newton 's conjecture had Newton himself notauthored it. Newton had been bor n prematurely; as an infant his headhad to be supported by a cervical collar; he was a sickly youth ([49]).Had he not lived to adulthood, the moder n scientic / industrial eramay not have come into being. Of course I cannot prove that no one but Newton could have gured out what we now call \" Newtonian mechanics \". All I can do is toreveal the differing metaphysical views we bring to such speculations.I, for one, am especially struck by the fact that so many other persons,working away at the same problems, from ancient times right up toNewton, did not conceive of the world the way he did. I am struck by the singularity of his accomplishment. Others, in looking at preciselythe same historical data, will interpret it differently. These others will88 Beyond Experience see in that data a steady intellectual evolution and will come to regard Newton 's accomplishments as something of a historical necessity.They see the emergence of Newtonian mechanics as something whichwas bound to happen, if not exactly at the hands of Newton, then atleast by somebody or other. W have already seen something of this e attitude implicit, I believe, in the paragraphs above from MichaelArbib. T date, the debate between those, including myself, whoo believe that mathematics, science, philosophy, art, etc. are more of anaccident than an inevitability and those who take the contrary viewremains speculative. W each will cite the same historical data but will e draw glaringly different conclusions. That the same body of data can be, and often is, interpreted in radi- cally different ways, indeed often in ways inconsistent with one anoth-er, is a pervasive fact virtually guaranteeing differences in our world-views. W nd another example, rather akin to the current one about e the inevitability of something like Newtonian mechanics emergingeventually in the intellectual history of an intelligent race of creatures,in the debate over the existence in evolution of a goal or purpose.Religious-minded persons, not necessarily creationists or personsopposed to the evolutionary account, looking at the same history asevolutionists and seeing in it how any number of ' accidents ' wouldhave derailed its arriving at its present stage, nd in that history clearevidence of the hand of a guiding God. The empirical data of evolu-tion may be agreed upon by both atheist and theist. Y t where one sees e merely life adapting to a changing environment, the other notices thecontingency of all of this so much so that he or she cannot conceive ofits having happened at all except as having been guided by somethingor someone supernatural. If S E T I is successful, if our radio telescopes succeed in nding within the radio noise of the universe signals which bear the unmistak-able mark of intelligent origin, those who take the contrary view fromme, those who believe that other civilizations can and will progress toradio communication, will have won the day. If diligent search,however, does not lead to success, my view will not have been provencorrect; the debate will remain inconclusive. What is the upshot? It is simply this: I see the development of math- ematics, of science, of philosophy, of art, etc. all fairly much of apiece, i.e. as the product of creative genius. But if we are to discoverintelligent life elsewhere in the universe we shall have to assume thecontrary, namely that extraterrestrial mathematics and science willhave evolved along lines pretty similar to our own and that at someUnderdeter minism ( I I ) 89 point are, or were, at the stage we now nd ourselves. I nd these assumptions not particularly well-founded, and they seem to me toissue from some very dubious assumptions about the manner in whichintelligent beings are able to make sense of, and control, their environ-ments. Be that as it may, I also recognize that unless we make these -to my mind, dubious - metaphysical assumptions, then our hopes ofnding extraterrestrial intelligent life are pretty much doomed. Theonly counsel I would be prepared to make is this: let us proceed with S E T I, but let us also take care that it not absorb too many resources, resources which could be better spent on more immediate and pressingneeds of humankind.C H A P T E R S I X Putting concepts under stress ( I ) 6.1 The limits on science Aristotle was a physicist and a biologist; Francis Bacon, a physicist; Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz also were physicists; so was Imman-uel Kant; Charles S. P irce was a physicist, astronomer, and geodesist; e William James was a psychologist; Ludwig Wittgenstein, engineer; Pierre paleontologist; and Noam e Chomsky, a linguist. The list of philosophers who were also scientistsgoes on and on. Indeed, until the nineteenth century there was littledistinction between philosophy per se and science. Both were con-cer ned with plumbing the secrets of nature. Departments of physics inuniversities were usually called \" natural philosophy \". Scientic jour-nals often incorporated the word \" philosophy \" in their titles. Onemoder n physics journal retains its title of 1798: Philosophical Maga- 1zine. The oldest (1744) scientic society in the United States, the American Philosophical Society, still bears the name given it by itsfounder, Benjamin Franklin ([23], 5-9). Only in the nineteenth cen-tury, particularly with the growing emphasis on the distinction be-tween a priori knowledge and empirical knowledge, did the partner-ship of two thousand years between philosophy and science begin tobecome undone. Within the universities, physics departments andpsychology departments split off from philosophy departments inorder to practice ' empirical ' science, leaving philosophy - it was \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. Philosophical Magazine is published each month, in three volumes, \" A \", \" B \", and \" Letters \". The journal is devoted to topics \" in the experimental,theoretical and applied physics of condensed matter. P rt A deals with a Defects and Mechanical Properties; P rt B with Structural, Electronic, Opti- a cal and Magnetic Properties. \" (See \" Notes for Contributors \", vol. 58A, no. 6[Dec. 1988].)Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 91 imagined - to pursue knowledge in the a priori manner of mathe- 2matics and logic. The split was a historical aberration. It came about through the naive belief that natural science could be pursued free of philosophicalideologies or metaphysical world-views. But there never has been atime when science was essentially and solely empirical and therenever has been a time when philosophy was essentially and solely apriori. The difference between the practice of science and of philoso-phy is, and always has been, one of a matter of the degree to whichresearchers conduct empirical research. No science is ever totally freeof philosophical components, and little, if any, philosophy eversprings out of the resources of pure reason uninfor med by any empiri-cal data whatsoever. Even if few philosophers themselves conductlaboratory experiments, they must nonetheless take cognizance of theresults of experimental research in their own philosophical pursuits. Because it was prompted by mistaken views about the very nature of science and of philosophy, the articial parting of philosophy andscience in the nineteenth century never could be very thorough. T o o many problems in the sciences - the record is virtually endless - havesince cropped up which positively demand philosophical examination:the advent of non-Euclidean geometries; the demise of the absolutetheories of space and time; the attack on the Newtonian world-view;the rise of evolutionary theory; the unleashing of nuclear destruction;the appearance of articial intelligence; the discovery of split-brainphenomena; the challenge of the possibility of paranormal experi-ences; the technological ability to extend bodily functions past braindeath; etc. Bare empirical science is inadequate to provide a humancontext, a sophisticated understanding, of the implications and rele-vance of such a flood and diversity of infor mation. The techniques ofempirical research do not provide the scientist with the conceptualtools needed to synthesize a satisfactory, comprehensive world-viewout of these disparate pieces. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. Some philosophy departments were to experience successive, if not exactly systematic, fragmentation. At Harvard, for example, the Departmentof P litical Economy broke away from the Philosophy Department in 1879;o the Department of Social Ethics, in 1906; and the Division of Education, alsoin 1906 ([38]). The Psychology Department, however, unlike those at mostother American Universities where the split had come earlier, remained as adivision within Philosophy until 1934 ([24], 24, and [118], 459-63).92 Beyond Experience If science cannot cope without philosophy, the latter, in its tur n, withers without the stimulus of science. Ethics could never be quitethe same once travelers brought back news of the incredible diversityof moral nor ms in different, far-off societies. Newton 's theory of ab-solute space (the ' sensorium of God ') had to give way once Einsteinhad published his special theory of relativity. The simple dualism of aunied mind and a single brain has had to be rethought in light of dis-coveries about the differing functions of the right and left cerebralhemispheres. The concept of an object 's being at a determinate placeat a particular time is challenged by the indeterminacy inherent inquantum mechanics. And the very categories themselves in ter ms ofwhich we analyze language have had to be re-examined in light of thediscoveries of cybernetics and the quantication of infor mation. Thediscoveries and theories of science provide much of the driving forceof moder n philosophy. Indeed, it strikes me as a certainty that thegreater part of moder n philosophy simply would never have been con-ceived except as a response to the infor mation explosion in the sci-ences. Dozens of philosophers have spent years writing volumes onthe relativity of space and time, on multidimensional spaces, etc. onlybecause of the stimulus of post-Newtonian physics. Countless philoso-phers today pursue issues in, for example, medical ethics, sociobiol-ogy, linguistics, and articial intelligence only because of the need within the many sciences for help with conceptual puzzles. Since the late twentieth century, science and philosophy have begun to forge new alliances. The historical parting of the ways is being re-versed. The discipline of cognitive science, for example, is as muchphilosophy as it is psychology and linguistics. Researchers in articialintelligence do not t comfortably into the strict categories of engineeror philosopher, but often are a bit of both. Economists, too, particu-larly those doing research in welfare economics, straddle the historical 3boundaries between empirical research and ethics. One of the most pervasive, but mistaken, notions of our moder n era, a notion which is a clear holdover from nineteenth-century viewsabout knowledge, is that each of our beliefs may be assigned to one of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. In recent years, many new interdisciplinary philosophy journals have been launched, including The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy (1976), Lin- guistics and Philosophy (1977) [successor to F undations of Language ], Law o and Philosophy (1982), Economics and Philosophy (1985), and Biology and Philosophy (1986).Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 93 three categories: either a belief is, or can be, judged true or false by scientic investigation, e.g. that aluminum has a lower melting pointthan tungsten; or a belief is a matter of ethics to be decided either byconvention or the pronouncements of some religion or other, e.g. thatit is wrong to institute afr mative-action policies in admitting studentsto universities; or, nally, a belief is essentially just a matter ofopinion, e.g. that some particular work of art or piece of music orsculpture is better than some other one. The rst of these categories is,often honorically, called \" objective \"; the third, often pejoratively,called \" subjective \"; and the second, something neither quite the onenor the other, viz. \" conventional \" or \" God-given \". Neither the exclusiveness nor the exhaustiveness of these three categories is given much credence by philosophers any longer. Thelines of demarcation between these categories are not nearly as clear-cut as for merly imagined. More important, these categories certainlydo not include all the ways we human beings have found to exploretruth and to ground beliefs. It is not my purpose here to explore matters of ethics or of aes- thetics. It will sufce, for my purposes, simply to war n that pursuingthe answers to ethical questions and to aesthetic questions is never just a matter of convention or opinion. Like science and metaphysics,these areas of perennial concer n must be infor med by empirical dataand by human reason. What is of particular concer n to me is to challenge the mistaken idea that so many persons have of the potency of science to answerquestions lying outside of ethics, religion, and aesthetics. Science cantake us only so far. Whatever results issue from a scientic experimentwill always fall short of answering all the questions we contrive forourselves. Consider, for example, Descartes 's theory of the relation-ship between minds and brains. In the seventeenth century, Ren \u00b4 Descartes (1596-1650) gave e expression to one of the most enduring theories of mind and brain. Heargued that minds and brains are distinct - i.e. different kinds of -substances, in particular that brains are physical things, all of which take up (occupy) physical space, while minds are mental things and do not take up physical space. Each of us, when alive, is a curious amal- gam, then, of two different kinds of things, or substances: a physical thing, i.e. a human body including its brain, and a nonphysical mindor psyche. The problem, then, became to try to offer a theory explain-ing the relationship between these two substances. How is it possiblefor these two, essentially different, kinds of things to interact in a94 Beyond Experience causal manner? How, exactly, does a cut in your nger cause (bring it about that you feel) pain? W unds, on this theory, are physical events, o while pains, on this theory, are supposed to be mental events. How does something which occurs in space (an incision in your nger)cause something which is not in space (the pain you feel)? Or, takinganother example, this time going the other way, how is it possible thatyour desire for a drink of water, your desire being - on this theory -something that exists in your mind and is thus not physical, causesyour body, a physical entity, to rise up out of a chair, cross the room,tur n on the kitchen tap, and lift a drinking glass to the stream of waterissuing from the faucet? Descartes 's successors, to this very day,struggle with these problems. Other philosophers have offered quite different theories. Some have argued that Descartes 's fundamental distinction, that is, betweenminds and brains, is misconceived. Some of these critics have argued,for example, that minds are not distinct from brains, that mental statesand events are nothing other than states and events in the central nerv-ous system. And needless to say, there are a variety of other theories,as well, which are variations on these two principal themes. Since themid-twentieth century we have enjoyed (or suffered, depending onyour attitude about these sorts of things) several different theoriesabout the relationship between minds and brains. The point of bringing up this embarrassment of riches is to focus on a certain naive attitude some persons bring to these debates. Everyteacher who has ever introduced students to the problem of therelationship of mind and brain has lear ned to expect that some stu-dents will regard the question as one to be settled by empiricalresearch in the laboratory. T these students, the question initially o appears analogous to questions such as \" What is the relationshipbetween fever and infection? \" and insofar as this latter question per-mits of empirical resolution, so, too, does it seem to them that the for-mer, about the relationship between mind and brain, ought to permitof empirical resolution. These students express condent belief that -just given enough time, money, and resources - scientists will be ableto decide such issues by their usual methods. Nothing that emerges from the experimenters ' laboratories can ever, or indeed could ever, settle the issue between dualists, personswho hold, like Descartes, that mind and brains are fundamentally dif-ferent kinds of substances, and monists, persons who hold that thereare not these two kinds of substances. It has often been alleged that the reason science cannot provide aPutting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 95 denitive answer to Descartes 's puzzle is because science is essen- tially directed to exploring material, or physical, features of the world,that science is incapable of exploring nonphysical entities. But theexplanation of the source of the difculty is, I think, really much moreprofound. F r it is simply false that science is essentially incapable of o examining nonphysical things. Suppose, just for the sake of argument,that minds, or more exactly mental states and mental events, are non- physical. Suppose, just for the sake of argument, that mental states andevents are - let us say - weightless, have no exact position within ourbodies, lack color, have no scents, etc., i.e. lack most, if not all, of theproperties we usually nd in physical entities. Nevertheless, even if allthis were true, science could still explore and lear n a very great dealabout mental states and events. Science might lear n, for example,whether it were possible for persons to ' think themselves out of ' pain,whether bright patches of red in our visual elds are succeeded bygreen patches, whether certain odors might evoke certain memories,whether musical acuity correlates with mathematical ability, etc. As amatter of fact, these sorts of experimental researches are precisely thekinds psychologists regularly do pursue, and indeed do so withouthaving settled the issue whether mental states and events are, or arenot, brain states and events. In short, the inability of science to answerthe question whether mental states are brain states does not arisebecause science is essentially incapable of examining nonphysicalentities. F r all we know mental states may be nonphysical entities. If o they are, then science is, even now, examining nonphysical entities. The real source of the difculty in trying to decide the relationship between mind and brain is that in exploring the mind of a subject,psychologists have no non-question-begging test to tell them whetherthey are looking at some physical feature of that subject 's centralnervous system or at some other, nonphysical, feature of that subjectwhich, although possibly correlated with some physical feature, may -for all that - be distinct from it. Suppose a dualist and a monist were having an argument. Suppose the dualist were to offer the theory that pains accompany or are caused by certain kinds of nerve rings but are not literally those rings themselves, while her colleague, the monist, were to argue thatthe pains were not something accompanying the nerve rings but were, literally, the nerve rings themselves. They may perfectly wellagree about the experimental data: that increasing the rate of ringsincreases the reported magnitude and duration of pain; that anesthetiz-ing certain nerves blocks the pain; that bombarding the subject with96 Beyond Experience intense so-called pink noise also blocks the pain; etc. What would any of this show about the correct answer to the question whether painsare physical events? It should be clear that none of this would settlethe matter. The question, and its resolution, goes well beyond theexperimental data. This is not, of course, to deny that empirical data have a bearing on the issue. They do. But only up to a point. If there were no detectablecorrelation between pains and physical states, if pains seemed to occur randomly without any physical cause whatever, then we prob-ably would be positively disinclined even to consider that they mightbe physical states. But we already know enough about the world toknow that pains, more often than not, do occur when certain sorts ofphysical events occur. What experimental research tells us, then, isthat there is not just a bare possibility of dualism 's being false, butthat there is empirical evidence which is consistent with another the-ory, viz. monism. The empirical data which we have about minds and brains are con- sistent with (at least) two different theories of the relationship between minds and brains. And from an examination of the sorts of data whichempirical research is capable of yielding, it is clear that no forthcom-ing or future data could ever settle the dispute. It is at this point thatthe problem, having originated within science, must go beyond sci-ence, to metaphysics. How, if not by empirical research, is metaphysics to be pursued? W have already seen, in chapter 4, that Logical P sitivists had beeneo convinced that metaphysics is an impossibility and that any preten-sions it might have to furnishing us knowledge are illusory. That par-ticular opposition has pretty well, in time, damped down. But the chal-lenge remains. W really must address the problem how, if not by em- e pirical research, one can hope to answer the sorts of questions sciencemust leave unanswered. T what might one take recourse? o I hope that the answer should already be beginning to become clear in light of what I have been saying in the previous three chaptersabout theories and underdeterminism. W pursue metaphysics by e trying to construct the best theories we can to explain, i.e. to makesense of, the puzzling aspects of our world which science is incapableby itself of explaining. As we venture further from the empirical base,our theorizing becomes more difcult and less deter mined, or ifyou will permit me an ugly (but infor mative) phrase, our theorizingbecomes more underdetermined . Metaphysical theories about, for example, the ultimate relationshipPutting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 97 between minds and brains, theories which presuppose and try to accommodate all the empirical data of the experimental laboratory,but which also try to go beyond that data, are probably destined neverto convince all rational persons. Being even more underdeterminedthan the scientic theories on which they ride piggyback, they prob-ably always will be the object of dispute and of criticism. But this issimply our human condition. No matter how much empirical data wegather, however diligently and conscientiously, that data always willbe insufcient to establish our scientic theories as true and alwayswill be insufcient, to an even greater degree, to establish our meta-physical theories as true. Y t we human beings seem insatiably curi- e ous. Our knowledge has no natural stopping point. Most of us rebel atthe very thought that our knowledge may be at an end. Even if themethods and tools of psychologists and physiologists cannot, in prin-ciple, tell us, for example, nally whether minds are, or are not,brains, we still persevere in wanting to know such a thing. And if sci-ence cannot tell us, then we will go beyond science, to metaphysics. 6.2 V guenessa Metaphysical theories are proffered solutions to conceptual puzzles. What is the concept of mind ? What is the concept of person? What is the concept of identity? What is the concept of material object ? What are the concepts of space and of time? Etc. It is not essential that we try to get very clear what a concept is. That exercise may be left for books on the philosophy of language andof mind. Let me say only this: persons have a concept of - let us takeas an example - redness, if they are able, for the most part, to use cor-rectly the word \" redness \" or some other word, in some other lan-guage, which means pretty much what \" redness \" does in English. Tobe sure, there are a fair number of things about which one could seekclarication in this brief exposition. But let me add only that, on thisparticular explication, concepts are not words themselves, but areexpressible by words. Speakers of different languages, then, e.g.English and French, may have the same concepts although they will 4use different words to express them, e.g. \" redness \" and \" rougeur \". \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. I have stated a quasi-sufcient condition for having a concept, but not a necessary one. Animals, e.g. dogs and cats, probably have certain concepts,but dogs and cats lack languages. Thus, having certain linguistic abilities98 Beyond Experience Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), in a famous paper, once wrote that \" all language is vague \" ([180], 84). He also wrote that \" all knowledgeis vague \" (90), that words are vague (85), and \" that every propositionthat can be framed in practice has a certain degree of vagueness \" (88).What all this comes down to is that the concepts which gure in thepropositions we frame, i.e. in our beliefs, theories, musings, doubts,certainties, etc., are themselves vague. V gueness in beliefs, in theo- a ries, etc. is traceable to vagueness in our concepts. In what I am sure was intended as a facetious remark, Russell added, \" whatever vagueness is to be found in my words must be at-tributed to our ancestors for not having been predominantly interestedin logic \" (84). Had he reflected upon this remark, I am sure Russellwould have had to admit that history could not have been otherwise.F r general ter ms, such as \" red \", \" war m \", \" bald \", and \" tasty \", to beo useful, indeed to be learnable by persons not bor n already knowing alanguage, those ter ms must be somewhat vague. Concepts could not be taught, and could not be lear ned, except if they were vague. A ter m, or a concept, is vague if there are particular cases (in- stances, things, etc.) which do not fall clearly inside or outside therange of applicability of the ter m. At what point exactly does an objectcease being red? How much hair exactly must a man lose to be judgedbald? In what manner and to what degree must a person hold theologi-cal beliefs and practice the dictates of some religion to be regarded asreligious? Such questions admit of no precise answers and the con-cepts redness, baldness, and religious must be regarded as vague. If most of our workaday concepts were not somewhat vague, we probably could never have lear ned them, and we certainly would havegrave difculty in applying them. Indeed we can easily see how utter-ly counterproductive it would be to attempt to reduce the vaguenessinherent in the concept bald. Suppose we were to stipulate that anyone who had fewer than 2089 hairs on his scalp was to be regarded asbald. (This of course presupposes that we have already similarly stipu-lated where one 's scalp leaves off and one 's face begins. The dif-culty thus begins to mushroom. What begins as a problem in makingthe concept bald more precise quickly also becomes a problem in revising the concepts of face, scalp, hair, etc. But we will not trouble \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 sufces in the case of human beings to show that those human beings have certain concepts, but those linguistic abilities should not be taken as the verysame thing as having those concepts.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 99 ourselves over this appreciable further difculty, since we have prob- lems enough with the very rst level of refor m.) On this new, rened,concept, some persons would clearly be seen to be bald, others clearlynot so. But there will be cases for which we would have to count hairshafts to be sure. Now, given the sorts of taboos in this society, andgiven our sorts of interests, we are not much inclined to go about con-ducting an inventory of the precise number of hairs on an acquain-tance 's scalp. If we were to impose the imagined precision on the con-cept bald, we would, almost certainly, immediately supplement that precise, and now fairly useless, concept with a vaguer, more practicalone, one which for all intents and purposes would simply duplicateour present concept of baldness . In short, any suggestion that we have vague words in our language, vague concepts in our conceptualscheme, only because our ancestors did not make the effort to be moreprecise would be wildly wrong. W have vagueness in our concepts e because of the way we lear n language and because some vagueness ispositively required. F r a conceptual scheme to be workable it is essential not only thato some concepts be relatively vague but that there also be mechanismsfor reducing vagueness as the need arises. No legislator could possiblyenvisage all the ways there might be to create a public disturbance orto threaten the public health. At the tur n of the twentieth century onlya clairvoyant could have imagined the nuisance potential of portablestereo radios and the threat to health posed by the careless use of D D T or by the promiscuous behavior of an A I D S sufferer. Key ter ms in legislation - \" public good \", \" intellectual property \", \" privacy \", etc. -must always remain somewhat vague and thus open to later renementin light of changed circumstances. What is true of legalese is true as well of English at any stage of its gradual evolution. Our concepts are adjusted to allow us to cope withthe world pretty much as we nd it now. As our knowledge expands,as new technology appears, as our sense of right and wrong graduallychanges over time, our concepts must be revised to allow us to operatewith these changes. The word \" justice \" has not changed for a few hundred years, neither has the word \" art \", nor the word \" death \". But our concepts of justice, of art, and of death surely have changed in that period. It was not too long ago, for example, that a person whose hearthad stopped beating was considered dead. Not any more. Nowadays aperson whose heart has stopped beating may be considered, like per-sons who have temporarily stopped breathing, not dead but in a life-threatening situation which may warrant heroic resuscitative meas-100 Beyond Experience ures. In short, we have, in the last fty or so years, in response to a changed medical technology, revised, not the word \" death \", but the 5concept of death. 6.3 Conceptual analysisT solve a metaphysical puzzle is, ultimately, to make a suggestion,o i.e. to offer a theory, about how we do in fact use a concept or - more often - how we ought to use (i.e. revise) a particular concept. When Hume, for example, began his examination of the endurance throughtime of material objects, he took care to insist that as we ordinarilyconceive of a thing 's enduring we allow for the thing to change some- 6what. He asks us to imagine how we would respond to the situationof something 's changing counterfactually* (i.e. contrary to the waythe world actually is) by the acquisition or loss over time of somesmall part. He anticipates that we would not, ordinarily, count that asdestroying the thing 's identity, and takes that expected response asevidence of how we actually do use the concept. (W will retur n to e this sort of technique, construing its counterfactual aspect as thedescribing of a possible world, in section 6.4. There we will examineLocke 's attempt to elicit our ordinary concept of person.) This rst kind of conceptual analysis, I will call \" narrow analysis \". Some authors prefer the expression \" pure analysis \". \" Narrow analy-sis \" simply means an assay of the standard or typical conditions forthe applicability of a concept. Thus Hume 's preliminary remarksabout endurance through time can be regarded as narrow analysis.And so, too, can the example Bradley and I offered in our bookP ssible W rlds , when we argued, in effect, that the concept of knowl- o o edge is a complex concept ([34], 183) and that it has the concept of belief as one of its constituents (23). Put another way, we argued that it is part of the analysis of the concept of knowledge that any case of knowledge is also a case of belief, e.g. to know that it is raining entails (among other things) believing that it is raining. The example we \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5. Certain English words have changed enough over a period of three hundred years so as to make reading some eighteenth-century philosophyproblematic. One must recognize, for example, in reading Locke and Hume,that words such as \" idea \", \" impression \", \" power \", and \" necessity \" simply donot mean to moder n readers what they did to eighteenth-century readers. 6. The passage from Hume ([101], 255-6) is quoted below, p. 331.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 101 chose is perhaps more controversial than one would like for illustra- tive purposes. Nowadays I think I would be more inclined to chooseas an example the concept of triangle, and would argue that it is part of the analysis of the concept of triangle that all triangles have three 7sides. Such knowledge as this is standardly called \" analytic knowl- edge \", and on the account preferred by some philosophers at least,Bradley and I certainly among them, would be deemed to be a priori 8knowledge. But there is a second kind of analysis, one which may be called \" broad analysis \", which goes far beyond the limited descriptive natureof narrow, or pure, analysis. In this latter kind of analysis there is asignicant component of revision. (Recall the quotation from Straw-son in chapter 2, p. 23.) When we read Hume 's discussion of the concept of causality , and more especially Kant 's response to that discussion, we detect a fargreater degree of revision than appeared in the discussion of endur-ance. Kant, in trying to gure out how and why we make causal attri-butions, given Hume 's claim (which Kant accepted) that causal con- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7. There are, of course, additional concepts involved as well, viz. that tri- angles have straight sides, and that the gure is closed. The concept three- sided is, then, but one constituent of the concept triangularity . 8. Let me quote from my explication of a priori knowledge which appears in the Glossary at the back of this book: \" When philosophers say that a state-ment can be known without experience, they mean that no particular experi-ence of the world, save perhaps lear ning a language , is necessary to be able to gure out the truth or falsity of the proposition. \" The italicized qualica-tion is essential. Lear ning a language can only be through experience. W are e not bor n knowing any language. But lear ning a language, lear ning underwhat conditions it is appropriate to apply words such as \" red \", \" bald \", \" tri-angle \", \" knowledge \", etc., is not to have empirical knowledge of this world.Lear ning English is not, for example, sufcient to infor m us whether all tri-angles are red, or whether all squares are fragile, etc. I might lear n, forexample, to speak S ahili, and might lear n the S ahili words for certain ww foods I never have laid eyes upon. But merely lear ning to use these wordswould certainly not put me in a position to know whether these various foodsare ever served at the same meal together, or whether there might be religiousstrictures barring their appearing on the same table together. T come to o know the latter, one would have to go beyond mere knowledge of the mean-ing of (S ahili) words, to empirical knowledge of the mores of the S ahili ww people.102 Beyond Experience nections can never literally be perceived - i.e. that all that is perceiv- able is sequences of events - proposed a new concept of causality : one which, like his analysis of space and time, theorized that causality 9is imposed on the data of sense ' by the mind '. When one undertakes to revise a concept, as Kant has done in the case of causality , the task is considerably more challenging, and likely to draw re, than when one tries merely to report how we typicallyuse a concept. Contributing to the difculty is the fact that there is noone way to go about inventing and arguing for changes in our concep-tual scheme. Nor are there probably just a few ways. There are manydifferent ways, some of which are historically and currently stylish,others - no doubt - not yet even imagined, i.e. others are surely to beinvented, developed, polished, and pursued by our descendants longafter all of us are dead. There is as much, or as little, method in the practice of metaphysics as there is in science. The commonly broadcast claim that there issomething called ' the scientic method ' is for the most part - as Ihave tried to show earlier - more fable than fact. Whatever scienticmethod exists is not something to be captured in a set of recipes, eitherby Bacon or by Mill or by a moder n successor. What method there isto the practicing of science is something lear ned by apprenticeship, byimitation, by trial and error, by imagination, and by exposing one 'sscientic work to the scrutiny and criticism of fellow scientists. Thepractice of metaphysics proceeds in a parallel fashion. The practice of metaphysics must be lear ned by apprenticeship, by reading the writings of metaphysicians, by attending to criticisms ofthose writings, and by daring to construct theories on one 's own, theo-ries which - just on the basis of probabilities - like most new theories,will prove to be, in one way or another, defective. Metaphysics, likescience, is not for the fainthearted, and if it is to be done well, is cer-tainly not for the dogmatic. But if there is no particular method to be followed in metaphysics in our attempts to generate revisions to our concepts, there are, nonethe- less, certain desiderata to be looked for in judging whether a proffered revision of a concept is to be accepted or rejected. Rudolf Carnap(1891-1970) has provided us with one of the best, most insightful dis-cussions of the features by which to judge the worthiness of a philo-sophical reconstruction ([45], 3-8). Carnap uses the ter m \" explication \" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9. See the quotation on p. 13 and the discussion on p. 30.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 103 to describe the process of revising a concept, what has here been called \" broad analysis \". The concept to be revised, he calls the \" expli-candum \"; and the new concept, the one which replaces the original, he calls the \" explicatum \". The latter, the new concept, the explicatum,is supposed to be less vague than the original concept, the explican-dum. But there is no question of the explicatum 's being perfectlyprecise. The explicatum is devised to be an improvement; it is not tobe thought of as a nished product suitable for use in all subsequentcircumstances. Other authors use different technical vocabulary. Where Carnap uses the ter m \" explicandum \", other authors sometimes use anotherLatinate ter m, viz. \" analysandum \", while still others prefer the techni-cal English phrase \" pre-analytic concept \". And where Carnap speaksof the \" explicatum \", other authors speak of the \" explicans \", the \" ana-lysans \", the \" reconstruction \", the \" explication \", and the \" analysis \", inthe last two instances using the ter ms \" explication \" and \" analysis \"both for the process of philosophical reconstruction and for the prod-uct of that reconstruction. Since the 1950s, the ter ms \" analysis \" and \" analytic philosophy \" have achieved a remarkable philosophical vogue. But that fashion-ableness has been accompanied by an unfortunate ambiguity. Occa-sionally \" analysis \", without any accompanying adjective, is used as Ihave used the expression \" narrow analysis \"; very often, however, it isused as I have used the expression \" broad analysis \", or \" revisionaryanalysis \", or as Carnap has used the ter m \" explication \". On balance,when other philosophers use the ter m \" analysis \" tout court , they prob- ably mean the latter sort of analysis, viz. \" explication \". Although thetruncated expression \" analysis \" is not entirely apt, and perhaps even alittle misleading, it is so well established within the philosophical lexi-con that it would be futile to try to avoid it. So hereinafter, \" analysis \"will be understood to mean \" explication \". Carnap argues that in judging a philosophical analysis (i.e. an expli- cation or reconstruction), there are four factors to be considered, viz.,that the explicatum (the revised concept) is to be 1. similar to the explicandum (the pre-analytic concept) 2. as exact as possible 3. fruitful 4. as simple as possible. There can be little question that in assessing and criticizing philosoph- ical analyses (reconstructions), these four factors do play a pivotal104 Beyond Experience role. Critics will praise or fault an analysis according to the degree they judge the analysis to satisfy these requirements. But there is nomechanical or precise way to go about quantifying these requirements,and disputes among philosophers can be erce as to the relative meritsof an analysis. Thus, for example, as we saw earlier, the formalistsadmire and promote a particular theory of explanation, the so-calledcovering-law model, which reconstructs explanations as arguments, inwhich universal or statistical laws, along with statements of antece-dent conditions, gure as premises, and the statement describing theevent to be explained gures as conclusion (e.g. recall Hempel 's 10example [p. 36] of a car radiator cracking). This analysis is prized bythe formalists for its exactness (Carnap 's second requirement) and itsrelative simplicity (Carnap 's fourth requirement). But other philoso-phers are adamantly opposed to the covering-law model, arguing thatit does violence to our pre-analytic notion of explanation which isheavily context-dependent and tur ns on the background knowledge ofthe person seeking the explanation and on whether that person suc-ceeds in understanding the explanation. In short, critics of the cover-ing-law model protest that the explicatum departs too far from theexplicandum, i.e. that the model fails on the rst of Carnap 's require-ments. Philosophical disputes, such as that between the covering-law theorists and their opponents, are inevitable. The trouble is that thevarious desiderata in a philosophical explication are usually in conflictwith one another. Exactness and simplicity are often purchased at theprice of severely constricting our pre-analytic concept. Such clashesare, in the main, inescapable. Our pre-analytic concepts often get intotrouble as they are extended to handle cases beyond the ' typical ' ones,i.e. they are not suitably clear or precise enough to comprehend new,problematic cases. But there never is, nor could there be, any one wayto modify a concept, and there is bound to be disagreement about thebenet of suggested changes. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. Beware not to confuse explanation with explication . W explain, fore example, historical events, biological processes, the means to start a car, and- on occasion - we explain the uses of a ter m (as I am doing right here, now).But we never explicate historical events, biological processes, etc. In recon-structing a concept, in offering a theory as to how it might be revised, weexplicate that concept, we do not explain it. Thus, it is possible, as we seehere, to explicate the concept of explanation. T do so is not to explain expla- o nation.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 105 All of this presupposes that concepts are not the sorts of things which are ' out there ' in some sort of absolute realm not of humanmaking. Concepts are not the sorts of things which we human beingsdiscover and either, as it were, comprehend ' correctly ' or - becausewe make a mistake, through carelessness, inattention, confusion, etc. -comprehend ' incorrectly '. That sort of theory of concepts has been sothoroughly dismissed in moder n philosophy that it no longer bearsrefutation. The concepts human beings use are not xed entities to bemined in an intellectual realm, but are human inventions, although ofcourse - as mentioned earlier - there may be physical constraintsplaced on what sorts of concepts we are capable of inventing. (As Isaid before, it is possible that human beings are so physically con-structed, ' hard-wired ' in our central nervous systems, as to be capableof for ming and entertaining only certain sorts of concepts. Animals -e.g. Thomas Nagel 's example of bats - may be incapable of for mingthe concepts we human beings use; and we, in tur n, may be quite inca-pable of for ming the concepts animals use.) In inventing and revising concepts, there can be no question of our ' getting it right ' in the senseof our reconstruction being true. Philosophical analyses, although having elements which may be judged true or false, are not, overall, tobe regarded as the sorts of things which are true or false. Whether anexplicatum is similar to an explicandum can, to a certain degree, beconsidered something admitting of a judgment which is true or false;similarly the judgment whether an explicatum is fruitful or simple orexact may, too, be regarded as something having aspects of truth andfalsity. But to judge an explication as fruitful, or simple, or exact, doesnot address the questions whether the concept is fruitful enough, whether it is simpler than rivals, and whether its exactness is pur- chased at the price of its simplicity and similarity to the pre-analytic concept. F r these latter sorts of judgments, one cannot argue simply o on the basis of ' fact ' or pretend that one 's claim is somehowmanifestly true or that a competing explication is manifestly false. Inmaking these latter judgments which are inherently part of judging theworth of a philosophical analysis, many factors other than truth and falsity come into play. (It bears remarking that there is one particular ter m which is often also invoked in these contexts, but which may prove a pitfall for theunwary, viz. \" intuition \". Unless one is aware that philosophers usethis ter m in a specialized, technical sense, confusion is bound toresult. When philosophers speak of \" pre-analytic intuitions \" and \" pre-philosophical intuitions \", and say of an analysis that it is, or is not [as106 Beyond Experience the case may be], \" counterintuitive \", they are not using the ter m \" intuition \" as it is ordinarily used, to mean something like \" knowl-edge prior to, or independent of, experience \", as for example, whenbiologists might say that a bird 's ability to build a nest without havingbeen taught to do so is intuitive [or instinctual]. In the context of phi-losophical analysis, or reconstruction, when philosophers talk of intui-tions, they refer to our judgments about the pre-analytic concept, theanalysandum . And when they say such things as \" the analysis is counterintuitive \", they mean that the proffered reconstruction stronglydeparts from the original concept. Thus, for example, were a philoso-pher to complain that some particular analysis of mind was counter-intuitive, she would not be objecting that the analysis contradictedsome in-built, or a priori, knowledge, but would - rather - be makingthe more reasonable claim that the analysis was very unlike the 11original, pre-analytic, concept. ) Philosophical analyses of concepts are nothing like dictionary denitions. Dictionary denitions are esteemed for their brevity. Phil-osophical analyses are anything but brief. Carnap 's discussion of therequirements for a philosophical explication occurs in his book Logi- cal F undations of Probability (1950) in which he explicitly says he is o trying to explicate one particular concept of probability. The ensuingexplication of what he calls \" logical probability \" consumes well over500 pages. Or, again, when Gilbert Ryle endeavored to offer his anal-ysis of mind in The Concept of Mind (1949) his explication ran to more than 300 pages. And John Rawls 's analysis of justice, Theory of Justice (1971), spans 607 pages. T revise a concept is no easy or triv- o ial matter. One must try to get clear how the concept has been used,how it runs into trouble for certain cases, and how altering it in a cer- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 11. The strongest case I know of a philosopher arguing for the importance of intuitions in judging a philosophical analysis occurs in Saul Kripke 's Naming and Necessity : \" ... some philosophers think that something 's having intuitive content is very inconclusive evidence in favor of it. I think it is very heavyevidence in favor of anything, myself. I really don 't know, in a way, whatmore conclusive evidence one can have about anything, ultimately speaking \"([116], 42). But even with this said, Kripke proceeds to argue that intuitionsare not inviolable. F r he immediately states that persons who nd a par- o ticular philosophical thesis - that there are accidental* properties - unintui-tive have their intuitions \" reversed \". Clearly, Kripke thinks both that someintuitions are to be preferred to others and that some intuitions can be suc-cessfully challenged by cogent argument.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 107 tain fashion might be thought to provide a way out of the difculties. If philosophical analyses are not like dictionary denitions, they are not like proofs in mathematics either. Unlike what I have called \" nar-row analyses \", philosophical analyses (explications) are not the sortsof things whose correctness (validity) may be demonstrated a priori.There is far more empirical content in philosophical analyses than isusually recognized. Because the two different kinds of analysis havenot always been clearly distinguished and because few philosophersever conduct original scientic research, e.g. because few philoso-phers ever themselves mix chemicals, construct electronic equipment,peer through microscopes or telescopes, dissect animals, unearthancient pottery, or drill boreholes, it has been easy to for m the mis-taken idea that philosophy is an a priori science. And probably morethan a few philosophers themselves have believed just this. Some per-sons, in noting that philosophers typically conduct no empiricalresearch, have come to believe that philosophy is just simply theproduct of deep thought, that philosophy - at its best - springs frompure, unaided reason and that the less contaminated it is by crass facts,the more it aspires to independence of ' the facts ', the better it is. Thetruth is, however, that any such philosophy would be grievouslyimpoverished. If philosophers themselves do not conduct empiricalresearch it is only because they depend, secondhand, on the empiricalresearch of others to infuse their own theories. W have here some- e thing of a separation of labors, but nothing like an exclusivity ofobjectives or interests. Metaphysical analyses of personal identity, for example, depend heavily and crucially upon certain empirical facts about material ob- jects (e.g. their impenetrability, their endurance through time) andupon certain empirical facts about memories (e.g. that memories arecausally related to witnessed events in one 's own lifetime). Similarly,philosophical analyses of art, of labor, of agency, of free will , of miracle, and of justice, etc., all presuppose an enormous background of empirical facts. One cannot get far in discussions of justice, for example, without a host of empirical presuppositions, both psycholog-ical and sociological: e.g. that there is a scarcity of material goods;that human abilities, desires, and opportunities are not distributedequally; that certain desires conflict with those of other persons; thatdisease and physical handicaps afflict some, but not all, persons; thatindividual lifetimes differ greatly; that knowledge and information arecommodities which are not universally accessible; and that decisionsare often taken in ignorance of what other persons are doing. Thus, in108 Beyond Experience trying to devise a philosophical explication of justice, no philosopher ever could hope to fashion such a theory a priori or hope to fashion atheory which would be applicable in every conceivable set of circum-stances. Quite the contrary, what is involved in fashioning a philo-sophical theory is the desire that that theory should be applicable tothis particular world. Metaphysical theories must have substantial em-pirical content; they must, that is, be tailored to this world, not to any 12and every possible world. And yet, paradoxically, one of the most powerful tools philosophers sometimes use in creating and testing their theories is to put the con-cepts at play under stress by asking what we would want to say if thecircumstances were markedly different from the circumstances thatordinarily prevail. This technique is so surprising, and yet so usefuland widely practiced, that it demands particular scrutiny. 6.4 P ssible worldso The aim in developing a philosophical theory is to clarify and possibly revise some of our concepts. How might we do this? One way, par-ticularly favored among metaphysicians, is to place the concept understress, to subject it to a kind of test wherein we ask whether or not wewould want to persevere in applying the concept to counterfactual cases, cases which are sometimes far from ordinary; indeed, in manyinstances, which are physically impossible. Thus, for example, in one of the most famous passages in philo- sophical literature, John Locke (1632-1704), in trying to analyze theconcepts of person and personal identity writes: ... should the soul of a prince, carrying with it the conscious- ness of the prince 's past life, enter and infor m the body of acobbler as soon as deserted by his own soul, everyone sees hewould be the same person with the prince, accountable only for \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12. \" ... many concepts of philosophically central interest are collage-like: they are internally diversied combinations of logically separable elements that are held together by the glue of a theoretical view of the empirical facts.Such concepts rest in an essential way on an empirically-based, fact-ladenvision of how things work in the world. ... Our concepts are not framed tosuit every possible world but in signicant measure adjusted to this one \" (Rescher [169], 120).Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 109 the prince 's actions; but who would say it was the same man? The body too goes to the making the man and would, I guess,to everybody, determine the man in this case, wherein the soul,with all its princely thoughts about it, would not make anotherman: but he would be [taken to be] the same cobbler to every-one besides [i.e. except] himself. ([124], book I I, chap. X X V I I, \u00a715) Unfortunately, Locke 's prose can be maddeningly obscure at times. This paraphrase of the passage may help to make it clear what (Ithink) Locke is trying to say: Suppose the consciousness of a deceased prince were to enter and infuse the body of a cobbler immediately upon the cob-bler 's own consciousness leaving his body. Anyone who knewof this transference would immediately regard the living personnot as the cobbler, but as the prince. But were someone igno-rant of the transference, then, in judging from the evidence ofthe physical body, he would take the person to be the cobbler. All of this is more than a bit strange. So far as we know, conscious- nesses, souls, psyches (call them what you will) do not flit from bodyto body. Indeed, so far as we know, not only do such things not hap-pen, the transference of consciousnesses is physically impossible.Why, then, should Locke, in trying to understand the concepts of per- son and personal identity , even consider such an outlandish counter- factual scenario? The explanation is immediately forthcoming: I know that in the ordinary way of speaking, the same person and the same man stand for one and the same thing. ... But yetwhen we will inquire what makes the same spirit, man, or per- son, we must x the ideas of spirit, man, or person in our minds; and having resolved with ourselves what we mean bythem, it will not be hard to determine in either of them or thelike when it is the same and when not. ([124], book I I, chap. X X V I I, \u00a715) Locke is here using the ter m \" man \" much as we would today use the ter m \" human being \", i.e. as designating a certain kind of physicalcreature, a member of the species Homo sapiens . Locke notes that the expression \" same man \" (or \" same human being \") and the expression110 Beyond Experience \" same person \" generally - or as he puts it, \" in the ordinary way of speaking \" - stand for one and the same thing. Of course he is right:whenever you judge some man (human being) to be the same man as,for example, when you judge the clerk in the drugstore to be the sameman as the man who used to work in the bakery, you could equally well say that this person is the same person who used to work in the bakery. In the ordinary way of speaking, \" same human being \" and\" same person \" may, stylistic considerations aside, be considered inter- changeable . Y u could even say that this man who is now working in o the drugstore is the same person who used to work in the bakery. But in spite of this - and this is the crux of Locke 's point and of hisstrange example - the two concepts are not after all the same. Theconcept human being - Locke tries to show through his counterfactual supposition - is different from the concept of person. Although all human beings may, as a matter of fact, be persons and all personsmay, as a matter of fact, be human beings, nonetheless the concepts ofhuman being and person are different. Suppose, just for the sake of an example, that every creature which has kidneys also has a heart and, conversely, that every creature with aheart has kidneys (this example is Quine 's [162], 21). Suppose, fur-ther, that you wanted to argue that the concept of having kidneys is not the same concept as having a heart . One thing you could not do would be to display some creature which has the one kind of organ but whichlacks the other, for, by hypothesis, there are no such creatures. Todemonstrate the conceptual difference between having kidneys and having a heart , you might take recourse to imaginary (counterfactual) cases. Y u could say something of the sort: \" Imagine an animal whicho has blood and an organ to pump that blood, but in which there is nospecic organ which lters waste products from the blood. Instead,waste products pass directly through the walls of the blood vessels,through the surrounding flesh, and are evaporated on the surface of theskin. \" The described animal is, of course, a creation of science ction,i.e. does not exist so far as we know. But whether it exists or not, itserves your purposes admirably. The mere logical possibility of its existence sufces to show us that the concept having kidneys and the concept having a heart are not the same concept. Now, of course, it must be admitted that we knew this all along. None of us for a moment was tempted to confuse, or conflate, the twoconcepts of having kidneys and having a heart . W knew these con-e cepts were distinct before, and indeed without, your telling the sci-ence-ction tale we just related.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 111 But how, exactly, did we know this? W knew it because, even e without perhaps ever having encountered a creature which had the onekind of organ and not the other, we were easily able to imagine such acreature. W could imagine, that is, that one of the two concepts might e be applicable to some one creature and not the other one as well. Thattrivial piece of imagining sufces to demonstrate that the two conceptsare distinct. Now we can see what Locke was up to. P rhaps every human being e we have ever encountered has been a person; perhaps every person wehave ever encountered has been a human being. But are the conceptshuman being and person the same concept or not? (The fact that they are expressed by different English words is irrelevant to making thedecision. The two words \" asteroid \" and \" planetoid \" are certainly dif-ferent: the for mer has eight letters, the latter nine; etc. Even so, differ-ences of expression aside, the concept of asteroid is the very same concept as planetoid .) Locke tries to show that there are certain describable counterfactual cases which, if they were to obtain, wouldbe ones to which one of the two concepts, human being and person, would apply and the other one not. If the mind of the prince were to enter the body of the cobbler, we would have such a case. F r if this were to happen, and we were to o know that it happened, we would - Locke condently predicts - knowthat although this is now the body of the cobbler, i.e. this human being is the human being who used to be the cobbler, this person is the per- son who used to be the prince. (Y u may nd yourself disputing o Locke 's prediction about how you would interpret such a case. Y u o may, for example, be disinclined to conceive of minds - or personali-ties - in such a way that they could even be the sorts of things whichmight migrate from one body to another. W will retur n to your mis- e giving later. F r the moment, let us conne ourselves to trying to un- o derstand what is thought to be shown by such counterfactual ex-amples.) Contemporary philosophers have borrowed a piece of terminology which was popularized in the seventeenth century by Leibniz, butwhich he, in tur n, had adopted from Scholastic (medieval) philoso- 13phy. The scenes and situations depicted in these short counterfactual \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13. Leibniz 's phraseology is familiar, even in popular culture: \" Why did God create this world? Because this is the best of all possible worlds \". Hisactual words were: \" There were an innity of possible ways of creating the112 Beyond Experience (or science-ction) tales, which are used to place selected concepts under stress, have come to be called by many contemporary writers 14\" possible worlds \". When Locke considered the possibility of the prince 's personality migrating from the prince 's body to that of thecobbler 's, he was not describing this world (i.e. the actual universe)but an imaginary world, a possible world different from the actualone. Nowadays, the technique of probing concepts by subjecting them to stress within a (described) possible world is commonplace. Contem-porary philosophical literature abounds with such examples. FriedrichW ismann, in an attempt to show that the concept of physical object a does not entail the concept of physical impenetrability , asks us to con- sider a possible world in which two chairs occupy the same place atthe same time ([209], 201-2). John King-F rlow, in an attempt to a show (among other things) that speaking a language does not requirethe speaker to have a concept of self, asks us to consider a possible world in which trees describe the scenery by rustling their leaves([110]). Sydney Shoemaker, in an attempt to show that time can passwith nothing whatsoever happening, asks us to consider a possibleworld in which specic regions are periodically subject to totalfreezing (i.e. subject to total so-called suspended animation) ([191]).Anthony Quinton, in an attempt to show that not all physical objectsneed stand in spatial relations to one another, asks us to consider apossible world in which any number of persons, upon falling asleep inEngland, share a dream of being on a tropical island ([164]). AndP ter Strawson, in an attempt to show that certain non-tangible objectse can be re-identied over time, even though not being continuouslyobserved, asks us to consider a possible world consisting solely ofsounds ([200], chap. 2). (W shall retur n to some of these examples in e subsequent chapters.) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 world, according to the different designs which God might for m, and each possible world depends upon certain principle designs or ends of God properto itself \" ([120], 36). And, \" It follows from the supreme perfection of God,that in creating the universe he has chosen the best possible plan ... Theactual world ... must be the most perfect possible \" ([121], 325). 14. Some authors use other vocabulary. F r example, S inbur ne ([202], ow 167), uses the ter m \" myth \" instead; King-F rlow talks of \" parables \"; and still a others talk of \" fables \". But many, of course, persist with \" counterfactualsituations \".Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 113 6.5 Methodological concer ns Like every other currently practiced philosophical method, that of examining concepts by subjecting them to stress within a possible-worlds story is an object of controversy. There are two main concer ns. The rst has to do with the limits of the method. The technique of putting a concept under stress in a possible-worlds setting may beused modestly - as a tool for discovering how we actually use thatconcept - or aggressively - as a means to promote a particular revi-sion of that concept. Nicholas Rescher is relatively sanguine aboutusing the method in the rst way, i.e. as a tool of narrow analysis, buthas severe misgivings about using it in the latter revisionist manner. ... the analyst must take care not to press his would-be clarication beyond the cohesive force of the factual considera-tions that hold together the concept as such. And this hasdenite implications regarding the usability of the science-ction type of thinking [i.e. a possible-worlds story]. ... A sci-ence-ction hypothesis can effectively bring to light the sig-nicant fact that certain of our concepts are indeed multi- criterial [depend on several logically independent factors] andrest on empirical presuppositions. But what this method cannotdo is to serve as a basis for precisifying [i.e. making moreprecise] our existing concepts, because the supposedly more precise account that results in these circumstances will not andin the nature of the case cannot any longer qualify as a versionof the concept with which we began. ([169], 113-14, 115) Where Carnap, we saw earlier, was enthusiastic about making a con- cept more precise, Rescher, in contrast, is considerably more hesitant,particularly when that revision comes about through the telling of apossible-worlds tale. Rescher worries that the kind of revision thatoften results in this latter instance is especially prone to sever justthose essential empirical roots which give our actual concepts theirusefulness. His uneasiness is well-founded. But his critique does notend in a wholesale rejection of the method. He cautions: \" The point ofthese observations is not to advocate an unbudging conservatism inthe conceptual area. No doubt there might conceivably be substantialadvantages to giving up some of our concepts in favor of others \"([169], 115-16). Whether the result of some proposed philosophical reconstruction114 Beyond Experience departs unacceptably far from our original concept is something that can be known only on a case-by-case basis; it can never be determinedin advance, and certainly not solely on the basis of the method used togenerate that proposed revision. Examining and revising our conceptsby telling possible-worlds stories has its risks, and those risks unques-tionably increase as one passes from merely assaying a concept toreplacing it. But carrying a risk does not render a philosophical tech-nique useless. It merely entails that its results must be judged individ-ually and never accepted or rejected in a blanket fashion. The second concer n over the use of possible-worlds stories in the practice of philosophy stems from a heightened examination, andmore than just a little criticism, of the concept of possible world itself. There have been in recent years a great many books (see e.g. [126],[122], and [72]), and a much greater number of journal articles, de-voted to such questions as: \" Just what is a possible world? \" \" What are the contents of a possible world? \" \" In what sense might a possibleworld be thought to exist? \" \" Are possible worlds logically prior topropositions, or are propositions logically prior to possible worlds? \" W need not, however, have settled views about such esoteric sub-e tleties in order to utilize the technique of telling possible-worlds tales.One need not settle all philosophical issues, or even for that matterexpress an opinion about some, to proceed with others. This is trueeven when the concepts invoked are fundamental and at the core of 15one 's method. Otto Neurath (1882-1945), in the midst of (what I regard as) a mis- guided argument against metaphysics, did offer an insightful, nowfamous analogy: What is rst given us is our ordinary language with a multitude of imprecise, unanalysed ter ms. ... W are like sailors who e have to rebuild their ship on the open sea, without ever beingable to dismantle it in dry-dock and reconstruct it from the bestcomponents. ... Imprecise ' verbal clusters ' are somehow al-ways part of the ship. If imprecision is diminished at one place,it may well reappear at another place to a stronger degree.([143], 91-2) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 15. Recall that one does not need a rigorous concept of, e.g., number in order to be able to do quite sophisticated work in arithmetic and other branches ofmathematics.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I ) 115 The sailors cannot begin with an unsheathed keel (at the foundation as it were) and build anew. All they can do is gingerly replace parts fromtime to time, taking care not to sink the ship as they proceed. In doing philosophy, we must start with a great many assumptions, techniques, and with a history. Of course any and every bit of this iseligible for examination and eventual revision, or even rejection or re-placement. But what we cannot do is to begin with nothing and build' from the bottom up '. It must be conceded that the concept of possible world needs elucidation (explication), that there are many, as yet, unsolved puzzlesabout the concept. No one could read current journal articles and be inthe slightest doubt about this. But none of this shows that the conceptcannot be used with great success in the explicating of selected other concepts. One does not have to have a sophisticated theory of possibleworlds to invoke the concept of possible world and to get much mile- age out of that concept in attempts, for example, to probe the conceptsof time, of physical object , of cause, etc. Indeed, legions of philoso- phers have not felt themselves in the slightest deterred by certainunclarities in the concept of possible world from using it in just these sorts of pursuits. Although some considerably more rened concept ofpossible world may be necessary for technical advances in such elds as logic and the philosophy of language, an intuitive or ready-at-hand concept of possible world has been and remains adequate for use as a tool in explicating many metaphysical problems. F r example, the concept of possible world needs no apology when o it is used in explicating the concept of person. A great number of phi- losophers, beginning with Locke and continuing through the presentday, have implicitly or explicitly invoked the concept of possible world for this very purpose. But their doing so then raises the question why anyone should want, or for that matter should even be tempted, torene the concept of person along the lines we have seen emerging in Locke 's discussion. Why, if - as earlier claimed - the two conceptshuman being and person may always, or nearly always, be inter- changed, might we want to try to distinguish them? T this last question, there is no one answer, nor are any of severalo possible answers absolutely straightforward. Again, we nd ourselvesexamining the very reasons some of us are attracted to metaphysicsand others not. The concepts, the beliefs, the theories and the myths each of us operates with are to a large extent inherited from generations of ances-tors and from the culture in which we live. There is no compelling116 Beyond Experience necessity that any of us ever should distinguish between human beings and persons. It is easy to conceive of a society (note here how natural it is to fall into yet another, brief possible-worlds tale) in which therewere no such distinction and, moreover, in which it never occurred toanyone to make such a distinction or even to ask whether it might beuseful to make any such distinction. W can imagine a society in e which all human beings were regarded as persons, all persons wereregarded as human beings, and that was the end of it. But the simplefact is, that is not this society. (The truth of the matter is that this world is not such a world, i.e. this world is not the possible world just described.) F r in this society, there is a long history of philosophers, o lawyers, scientists, novelists, etc. who have asked, and will continueto ask, \" What is a person? \" and who have not assumed that the answeris a foregone conclusion: \" a human being \". Our philosophical, histori-cal, mythological, and literary writings are lled with such examples:in Plato 's Phaedo where - in trying to solve the problem of knowl- edge - he hypothesized that persons exist prior to birth; in somereligious writings, where persons are claimed to be able to survivebodily death; and in our myths, e.g. where Merlin was supposed tohave been able to inhabit the bodies of animals. In his philosophicalnovel Y u Shall Know Them , V rcors has his protagonist, Douglas o e T mpleton, intentionally kill his own nonhuman offspring, the producte of his mating with an apelike creature. The question posed by such a(possible-worlds) fable is: \" Has T mpleton killed a person? \" If he has, e then he is guilty of murder; if not, then he has merely killed an animal. Anyone who can be engaged by the play of concepts in V rcors 's e novel has implicitly already made the distinction between being ahuman being on the one hand and a person on the other; has recog- nized that it is conceptually possible for these two concepts not toapply to the same creature; and has allowed himself to be receptive toa discussion of what, exactly, we are to understand by the conceptperson. The eventual answer is not to be found by a kind of philo- sophical excavating, i.e. the answer is not ' out there ' for the discover-ing. The answer, if it is to be forthcoming at all, will be the product ofsuggesting ways we might want to extend our intuitive (or pre-analytic) concept. W may even want to try to imagine how we might e react if placed in V rcors 's imaginary, possible, world. Confronted e with the offspring of a human being and an apelike creature, would webe inclined to regard that offspring as being more like a person ormore like an animal?

In Arthur C. Clarke 's 2001, Hal (Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer) seems to have ' a mind of its own ', so much so that it tur ns rogue, subverts commands, mutinies,and murders human beings, and when its crimes are uncovered, pleadsnot to be disassembled and despairs at the prospect of its impendingloss of consciousness: \" Dave, \" said Hal, \" I don 't understand why you 're doing this to me. . . .I have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission. . . .Y u o are destroying my mind. . . .Don 't you understand? . . . . . \" ([48], 156) Hal is made of the typical stuff of computers: wires, transistors, etc. Hal, clearly, is not a human being . But might Hal be a person? One of the principal goals of contemporary research in articial intelligence isto come to lear n the operations of human cognitive processes wellenough so that they can be replicated in a machine. If that comes topass, what is now regarded as just a possible world - a computerthreatening and pleading with us - we might discover is really a futureperiod of this, the actual world.C H A P T E R S E V E N Putting concepts under stress ( I I ) - P insa Sleep and pain tend to inspire poets and philosophers; micturi- tion [urination] and defaecation do not. With psychoanalysts, itis the other way round. - P ter Nathan, The Nervous System e ([142], 104) 7.1 Case study: Shared out-of-body painsThe constructing of possible-worlds tales to place concepts under stress in an attempt to rene or revise those concepts is no talismanguaranteed to produce success. It is just one method, among several,used by philosophers in their work. And its results, far from beingconsensual, sometimes provoke disputes as intense as those whichprompted the use of the method in the rst instance. T see how the technique might be used, and to see the sorts ofo objections it might elicit, let us discuss the possibility of public, objec-tive, out-of-body pains. At the outset, it is necessary to say that thequestion we will be examining - viz. \" Might there be public, objective(i.e. shareable), out-of-body pains? \" - is not to be regarded, in the rstinstance at any rate, as an empirical question. Only at a second stage of inquiry, can such a question be regarded as amenable to investiga-tion by empirical means. F r it is essential, rst, to determine whether o such a question is even meaningful (intelligible), and only if theanswer to this preliminary question is afr mative, can we thenproceed to the second. The preliminary question, then, might be statedthis way: \" Could the concept of pain apply to something public, out- of-body, or is its use reserved exclusively for sensations locatedwithin a living body and perceivable only to the person whose body itis? \" The challenge posed by such a question is to determine how onemight go about trying to answer it. Newcomers to philosophy often immediately tur n to the resource they have standardly used to determine the extent or range of applica-Putting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 119 a tion of concepts, namely, their dictionaries. But it quickly becomes clear that dictionaries are not about to help with this particular ques-tion. There will always be vagueness in our concepts. Although wemay from time to time reduce the vagueness of some of our concepts,we will never eliminate it entirely. Dictionaries cannot adjudicate theproper decisions to make when one operates within the penumbra ofthe meaning of a ter m; they are incapable of settling boundary dis-putes. When we ask ourselves whether we should apply a concept tosome phenomenon which falls within the penumbral region of a ter m,dictionaries, which are designed to report standard usages, must failus. W must take recourse to other means.e What the task comes down to is looking to see whether we can de- scribe a situation in which it would be reasonable to say that some-thing has occurred which is enough like ordinary ' in-body ' pain to beregarded as pain, and yet, is outside of one 's body and is perceivableby more than one person. W will begin by reviewing current theories e of pain and its causes. In the case of seeing, hearing, and touching, the perceived ' object ' (for lack of a better name) is almost invariably on or, more likely,external to (i.e. at some distance from) our skin. T be sure, we occa- o sionally do hear the rumblings of our own stomachs and do use ourhands to touch and feel various parts of our bodies, but for the mostpart, what we see, hear, and touch are physical objects external to ourbodies. W see houses, buildings, human beings, trees, motor vehicles, e dogs, etc.; we hear screeching tires, the voices of human beings, themusic of a piano, the high-frequency whistle of the flyback trans-for mer of a television set, etc.; we feel the knife and fork in our hands,the slipperiness of a bar of soap, the grip on the handle of a golf club;etc. In short, most often the ' objects ' of seeing, hearing, and touchingare external physical objects. The ' object ' of pain - or, to put it somewhat more perspicuously, what we feel when we feel a pain - is not a physical object. I mayaccidentally prick my nger with a pin, or cut my thumb with a blade,but the ensuing pain is not my feeling of the pin or of the blade . The pain begins, to be sure, with the pin 's pricking my nger, but it lastsfor some time after the pin is removed. The actual pricking may takeonly a minute fraction of a second, but the resulting pain may lastseveral minutes, long after the pin is removed from the site of theinjury. In feeling pain, I am not feeling the pin, but the injury caused by that pin. Physical injury may occur anywhere within one 's body. But while120 Beyond Experience no part of our body is immune to injury, only certain parts contain nerves which give rise to pains. Most persons are surprised to lear nthat their intestines, for example, are insensitive to incision, and thatbowel biopsies may be perfor med painlessly with no anesthetic what-ever. Similarly, the human brain lacks pain-generating nerve endings.But many sites throughout the body are sensitive to pain. How do we know where a pain is? How do you know, for example, that there is a pain in, let us say, the thumb of your left hand? Y ung o children, even those who have acquired a certain facility with lan-guage, are often notoriously bad at localizing their pains. Manychildren, obviously in pain and obviously having a serious ear infec-tion, frequently are unable to pinpoint their pain; they may not even beable to localize the region of their body where it hurts (i.e. are unableto localize the pain as being above their necks). It might seem, then,that we lear n over a period of time, by trial and error, to locate pains within our bodies. P rhaps at some early stage of our lives, we may, e for example, have experienced a pain and, in looking about our 1bodies, spotted an injury on our hand. In touching the wound, wemay have discovered that the pain increased (or decreased) and thuscame to believe that the pain was occurring at the site of the injury.Later, we were able to identify pains which originated from that loca-tion directly, i.e. without our having to look with our eyes, or probewith our ngers, for an injury. But in spite of its initial plausibility,this conclusion - that we lear n through trial and error to identify the sites of our pains - may be too strong. F r there is some contrary o experimental data which suggest that newbor ns are able to ' home in 'on the site of (at least some) pains directly, without a lear ning process:\" ... a newbor n can remove an irritant from his nose with his hand orget rid of an irritant on one leg with his other foot \" ([32], 19). Whatconfuses the issue is the fact that it is conceivable that this ability ofnewbor ns to localize (some) pains is only temporary, like their abilityto reach for visual objects. P rhaps, just as in the case of the latter e visual-motor ability ([32], 45), the newbor n may lose the innate abilityto localize pain directly, and may have to ' regain ' it in the ensuing \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. This picture is somewhat oversimplied. Some, but by no means all, injuries cause an energetic reflex movement, a flexion withdrawal of the limb,a fraction of a second before the pain impresses itself on one 's consciousness.Given this muscular reflex, one 's subsequent attention is naturally drawn tothat limb itself.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 121 a months by a lear ning process. In short, it is unclear how much of our ability to locate pains directly is innate and how much is a lear nedresponse. In any event, well before we reach adulthood our ability -whatever its origin - to locate pains directly is r mly in place. (Some researchers have suggested that we locate pains directly by utilizing an ' internal map ' [either lear ned or innate] of our ownbodies, on which we place, more or less correctly, the incoming sig-nals from the many nerve pathways according to their points of origin.How much stock is to be put in such a theory? Does postulating an' internal representation ' of our bodies help to explain this ability tolocate pains directly, or is this merely a metaphorical manner ofredescribing the very phenomenon itself ? W can well understand e why researchers differ in their attitudes toward such models. Someresearchers regard this model - of an internal, representational map -as the best, if not the only, way to account for the ability to locatepains and to know directly the disposition of our limbs. Other re-searchers regard the explanatory content of such a hypothesis as nil.They regard the postulating of such a map as unempirical and, indeed,as an entirely dispensable piece of baggage. The debate is but oneinstance of a century-old controversy about the utility of models inscientic explanations. The dispute can be expected to continueindenitely.) Our ability to locate pains directly, good though it often is, is far from perfect as being an ability to locate the injuries which are thephysical causes of those pains. F r there are a number of instances in o which persons will locate pains in their bodies far from the sites of theinjuries causing those pains. The best known of these is the paincaused by a rupture (popularly misnamed a \" slip \") of the fth lumbardisk. The ruptured disk presses on the sciatic nerve within the spinalcolumn. But the ensuing pain is nearly always felt some centimeters,or even nearly a meter, removed from the site of the trauma. The painis often felt in the hip, or down the back of the leg, or even in the toes.Such so-called referred pains sometimes mislead diagnosticians. Doc-tors will sometimes misdiagnose spinal injuries as pulled back liga-ments or as hip injuries. It is essential, then, to distinguish carefullythe site of a pain (i.e. where the pain is felt) from the site of the injurywhich causes that pain. Usually they coincide; occasionally, they donot. The most dramatic case of referred pain is the phenomenon, well- documented in medical literature, of the so-called phantom limb. Aperson who has had a limb amputated may complain of pains which122 Beyond Experience feel as they would had that limb not been amputated. F r instance, a o person who has had his left leg amputated may complain of pains ofjust the sort he would have had if that limb were still attached to hisbody, i.e. it feels to him as i f he still has a left leg and that there is a pain in that leg . From a physiological point of view we can explain the phenomenon in this way. The nerve endings of the niociceptor class of ' Ad ' (fast)and ' C ' (slow) bers at the site of the amputation (i.e. on the remain-ing stump of the limb) are ring and sending impulses along thesebers to the spinal cord, where they interact with a variety of otherimpulses (e.g. indicating touch or pressure) along with descending sig-nals from the brain. If these impulses are not masked or blocked in thespinal cord, then signals proceed to the thalamus and eventually to thecerebral cortex (see, e.g., [219], 103). These latter signals are so likethose which used to originate within his leg that they are ' mistaken 'for signals which originate, not on the stump, but from within the(nonexistent) leg itself. Now while this, or something very like this, physiological explana- tion is probably true, it does not by any means imply that the pain isnot exactly where the person says it is. The crucial thing to recognizeis that the location of pain, and the location of the injury causing thatpain, need not - and occasionally do not - coincide. The person com-plaining of pain in his hip, who in fact has no injury whatever to hiship but has, rather, a ruptured fth lumbar disk, has made no mistakeabout the location of his pain. The pain really is in his hip. He and his doctor make a mistake only if they infer from the pain 's being in aparticular place that the injury causing that pain must also be in thatsame place. So too with the case of the phantom limb. The pain, as distinct from the cause of that pain, is just where it is felt, e.g. 20 cm or so belowthe stump. It is just at this point, where we say that a sufferer 's pain may be 20 cm beyond the surface of his skin, that many persons will, perhapsunwittingly, suddenly switch theories about the criteria for locatingpain. In cases where the pains are within a sufferer 's body, most per- sons are perfectly content to use the patient 's own report as to thelocation of the pain as being denitive. The orthopedic specialist whoasks her patient to place his ngers on his pain, sees the sufferer placehis ngers on his hip. The doctor does not correct her patient, saying,\" No, you are wrong. The pain is really where your ruptured disk ispressing on your sciatic nerve, just about here \" (placing her ownPutting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 123 a ngers close to the injury) \" in the spinal column. \" Instead she might say, \" That sort of pain in your hip is caused by an injury which isactually several centimeters away from the site of the pain, here inyour spinal column. \" None of us has any trouble understanding thisdistinction. But let the location of the pain be out of one 's body, let it, for example, be felt as being 20 cm below the stump of an amputation,and immediately many persons will abandon the clear knowledge thatpains and their causes may be remote from one another and will revertto a radically different account of pain, one which totally blurs the dis-tinction between pains occurring where they are felt to be and painsoccurring where the injuries giving rise to them are located. F ced a with the report of a patient who says that it feels to him as if he stillhas a leg and that there is a pain in that leg, these revisionists willargue that the person 's pain simply is not where it is reported to be,but must instead be located at the site of the injury, i.e. on the stumpof the amputation. A person who, under the circumstances described, takes recourse to this latter theory has, I would strongly suggest, taken a retrogradestep. T argue in the case of a phantom-limb amputee that he is mis-o taken as to the location of his pain challenges not just the amputee 'sability to locate pain, but everyone 's, amputee and non-amputee alike.If the amputee 's report of the location of his pain is not to be givencredence - if, that is, the actual location of his injury is to be givenprimacy over his report - then there is no reason not to apply the samecriterion for every other report of pain as well, in the case of tooth-aches, spinal injuries, etc. The revisionists ' theory - that pains occur, not where they are felt to be, but rather where the injuries giving rise to them occur - thusdeparts flagrantly from our ordinary concept of pain. It is a proposalwhich sacrices much of what we ordinarily say and think about painfor the expediency of not having to attribute pains to locations outsideof bodies in the case of phantom limbs. But the price is too high. It isfar preferable to allow that pains can and do occasionally occur out-side of one 's body (as in the case of phantom limbs) than to subscribeto the theory that in every case of referred pain we have made a mis-take as to the location of the pain itself. An orthopedic specialist still would need to know, as an aid to making her diagnosis, that it feels to the patient as i f there is a pain in his hip. That crucial medical symptom does not disappear in adoptingthe revisionist 's proposal: it simply makes its description awkward. If124 Beyond Experience we were to adopt the revisionist 's proposal, then where we had earlier spoken simply and directly of the ' location of the pain ', we wouldnow have to talk clumsily of ' the impression as to the location of thepain ', or ' the place where the patient reports or believes the pain to be '. F r preferable, it seems to me, is to argue that the revisionist hasa confused two quite different things: the pain and its cause. P ins are a exactly where they are felt to be: often at the site of an injury, butsometimes at another place. If we resist the revisionist 's illicit conflating of the location of pains with the location of their causes, then the phantom-limb phenomenonmust count as a genuine case of an out-of-body pain. The only reason-able conclusion, it seems to me, is to insist that not only are out-of-body pains possible, they are in fact actual, i.e. they exist, in the caseof phantom limbs. But having argued that there are in fact out-of-body pains is not yet to have proved what I initially set out to establish, namely, thepossibility of the existence of public, objective out-of-body pains. While the phantom-limb experience is, I want to urge, best regardedas being a genuine out-of-body experience, it still falls short of dem-onstrating the possibility of there being publicly objective, i.e. share-able, out-of-body experiences. T have proceeded this far is still only o to have taken the rst step along the way to the intended goal. T pro- o ceed past this point, we must now take recourse to a possible-worldstale. So prodigious was his talent, so obvious was his promise, that even as a young teenager, having not yet graduated from highschool, Michael Robins had been wooed by all the best musicschools of the country. But there really was no choice. He had,since childhood, set his heart on studying the cello with JanosStarker, and so was quick to accept the offer from Indiana Uni- 2versity when it came. T persons unfamiliar with the school at o \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. Just as certain novels and romances, e.g. E.L. Doctorow 's Ragtime ([57]), are ctionalized histories through which ostensibly real persons parade, manypossible-worlds tales incorporate characters and places patter ned after thosein the actual world. These ctive entities, e.g. Indiana University and MaestroJanos Starker in the present case, are said to be \" counterparts \" of the similar-ly named entities in the actual world. They are, however, still creatures ofction.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 125 a Bloomington, the Midwest had seemed an odd choice. But that was only because they did not know of the visionary presidentsand deans who in a labor of love, in a small town surroundedby cor n elds and limestone quarries, had conceived and creat-ed one of the world 's nest and largest music schools. Michael flourished under Starker 's instruction, and when he graduated, he landed the position, which had just fallen vacant,of rst cellist in the recently resurrected NBC Symphony Or-chestra. His career seemed to be virtually assured, except that he had begun to experience, at rst slight and then increasinglysevere, pains in his right knee. X-rays and a biopsy conr medthe worst: a malignant tumor. Surgery was perfor med withinhours, but his right leg, from mid-thigh, had to be amputated.Being a cellist, there was no question that he would be tted, assoon as possible after the surgery, with a prosthetic leg so thathe could resume playing. F r nearly two weeks after the surgery, Michael was giveno heavy doses of morphine to kill the pain. But as the drug wasgradually withdrawn he began to experience classical phan-tom-limb pains. Mercifully, this new pain was not at all as debili-tating as that prior to the surgery, but it was there, naggingly,nonetheless. It felt to Michael again as if there were a pain inhis right knee. Of course he had no right knee, he could see that he had no right knee. But the pain ' knew nothing of that '. The pain felt as if it were in his right knee. The doctors tried to assure him that in most cases such phantom pains graduallysubside, but they did war n him that he could not be absolutelyassured that his pain would. In some few cases, phantom painshad been known to continue for the rest of a person 's life. A few weeks later, Michael was tted with his rst prosthesis, a mechanical affair, with a spring and hydraulic knee and asimilarly contrived mechanical ankle. There was no electroniccircuitry in the prosthesis and no connections whatever to eitherthe muscles or nerves in the stump of his leg. The apparatussimply strapped onto the healing stump. The phantom pain continued. But as he grew used to the prosthesis and would occasionally forget that he was wearingthe mechanical device, he would absentmindedly lean over torub the location of his pain in an attempt to assuage it a bit.Each time, as his ngers felt the cold plastic of the articial leg,126 Beyond Experience his hand recoiled as he discovered his ' foolish ' mistake and he felt chagrined (much as does a university lecturer who, in theagonies of nicotine withdrawal, has been known to ' take a puff ' from the piece of chalk in his hand). After having wor n the prosthesis for two years, Michael became quite used to the novel phenomenon of moving aboutthe world with a pain that was ' not quite in his body '. The pain moved along with his body; but instead of being - like most per-sons ' pains - inside the body of its sufferer, Michael 's pain was outside his body, not terribly far removed to be sure, only 20 cmor so, but denitely outside. There would be nothing particularly remarkable about this case were it not for what happened on the day of Michael 's third annual checkup. His surgeon wanted him to try a newprosthesis. Where the original device had used stainless-steelstrengtheners, this new one used carbon ber. The new legwas attached and seemed to work perfectly. The doctor thenasked Michael where the phantom pain was. Without looking,Michael reached down and tapped the knee joint and said \" righthere \". The doctor grinned. \" Mike \", he said, \" look what you 've done. Y u 've pointed to your old appliance, not the one you 're o wearing. \" Michael looked down, dumbfounded. He moved bothmechanical legs about, rst the one attached to his stump bycontracting (what remained of ) his thigh muscles, and then thediscarded original prosthetic leg by taking it in his hands andwaving it about. \" I don 't understand \", he said. \" The pain moves about as I shake the old unattached leg, not as I swing theattached leg. What 's going on? The pain seems to be in the knee joint of the unattached prosthesis, not 20 cm below thestump of my right leg as it has been for the last three years. \"P nic was mounting in Michael 's voice and the doctor was a quick to recognize the symptoms. \" P rfectly natural \", he lied e with all the credibility he could muster. \" Here, let me give you asedative. It will calm you down a bit. \" Michael did not protest. The next few days made medical history. Michael 's initial report of the incredible transference of the pain to his rst arti-cial leg tur ned out to be irrefutable. In one test, Michael wasblindfolded and the old prosthesis was moved silently about theroom. Michael could unfailingly point to the pain and correctlyjudge how far it was from him. But still stranger developments were in store. One of thePutting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 127 a researchers working with Michael 's surgeon wondered what would happen if another person were to wear Michael 's rst prosthesis, the one in which Michael 's pain seemed now to be housed. Another amputee, who had never experienced a phan-tom pain, was tted with the leg. Within eight hours, he too wascomplaining of a phantom pain: a pain, that is, several centime-ters below his stump, as if he had a leg and there was a pain init. The prosthesis was immediately removed, but it was too late.The pain did not subside, it simply moved farther away, as theprosthesis itself was moved about. Now there were two patientsfeeling the identical out-of-body pain! (The hospital administra-tors began to have visions of a malpractice suit.) Obviously, research would have to proceed cautiously. Since the pain was not terribly severe, it was agreed to use paid,infor med volunteers, explaining carefully to them that theymight be left with a permanent out-of-body pain. Most inter-viewees were repulsed by the prospect, but a few were sointrigued that, in spite of the dangers, they actually begged toparticipate in this historical experiment. They gladly signed thenecessary waivers absolving the researchers and the hospitalof any legal liability. One even made a sizable donation to thehospital. The experiment lasted for years. Every precaution imagin- able was taken. Elaborate measures were instituted to preventcheating or fraud. In due course, it was discovered that one didnot have to be an amputee to experience the effect. Merelystrapping the articial leg to one 's own good leg for twelve or more hours would induce the remarkable phenomenon. Thesubjects in the experiment were thereafter able to sense thepain even when the leg was removed out of sight to otherrooms; indeed, the pain could be felt at distances of up to150 km, well beyond the visual horizon. Ultrasophisticatedelectrograms revealed that there was spinal-cord and brainactivity associated with this pain sensation but there were noparticular afferent signals originating in the peripheral nervoussystem, i.e. the nervous activity giving rise to the sensing of' distant pain ' (as it had come to be called) appeared to originate directly within the spinal column itself. All the standard anal-gesics - morphine, acupuncture, etc. - remained as effective inalleviating distant pain as they were for ordinary in-body pain. Many skeptics believed that the phenomenon of distant pain128 Beyond Experience was a case of mind-reading, mass hysteria, or some such thing; but a few of them volunteered for the experiment and,without exception, every one reported that he felt the pain in thearticial limb and that so far as he could tell he was not readinganybody else 's mind. Eventually, some 237 different persons could all together feel the same pain, in the same place. In fact, it was because of the great number of persons all sharing the same pain that the experiment was eventuallystopped. Several of these subjects had increasingly, over theyears, grown annoyed at feeling a distant pain which movedabout from time to time. As long as the mechanical leg was leftin one spot, the pain was so constant as to hardly intrude upontheir consciousnesses. But when the leg was moved about, inbeing tted to a new subject, etc., the movement proved dis-tracting to many of the previous subjects. Eventually several ofthem who lived within the critical 150-km radius of the researchcenter protested the continued activity so vigorously that thematter was put to a mail vote. Over two-thirds of the affectedsubjects responded, and of them, more than 80% requestedthat the leg be retired. Michael 's surgeon then donated the leg to his alma mater, the Harvard Medical School, where it maynow be viewed in a sealed display case. No one, it is reassur-ing to mention, has ever experienced an out-of-body pain frommerely looking at the leg. Controversy over how to explain the phenomenon swirled for a generation. But the account which gradually seemed to winfavor was that somehow (no one offered an explanation of thisparticular part of the phenomenon) Michael Robins had, quiteunintentionally, managed to ' project ' (or ' displace ' [there really never was a very good word to describe such an unparalleledoccurrence]) his pain into his rst prosthesis. The pain wasreally ' there ' in the prosthesis : it could be felt - and indeed would continue to be felt - by anyone who was keen (or fool)enough to strap it tightly onto, or alongside, his own leg for ahalf-day or more. As the extraordinary discovery became widely known ( New England Journal of Medicine , Lancet, etc.), was discussed in medical and psychology textbooks, and was the subject ofseveral science programs on television (\" Nova \", \"NationalGeographic \", \"The Nature of Things\", etc.), a gradual broaden-Putting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 129 a ing took place in popular thinking about pain. No one ceased to regard pains as sensations; but what did change was thatpeople now began to talk easily and matter-of-factly about thepossibility of pain sensations occurring not only within one 's own body, but also in external objects where they might evenbe experienced (shared) by two or more persons. And whenthey came across early-twentieth-century philosophy textswhich denied the logical possibility of pains being shared orbeing external to one 's body, many of them thought it odd that any writer should have had such a blinkered conception. But, ofcourse, persons who adopted this uncharitable view of theirpredecessors had not placed the earlier views in their historicalcontext. W uld they, themselves, have had a view much differ- o ent from the earlier one if they had not witnessed for them-selves the extraordinary events in Michael Robins 's life? There is, so far as I can tell, nothing logically incoherent in this pos- sible-worlds story. It is, granted, wildly implausible. Indeed, I am cer-tain that nothing like this is likely to occur in this world. But foretell-ing the future was not the point of the tale. The point of telling the talewas to see whether one could, without logical self-contradiction,describe a case of a public, objective, out-of-body pain. I submit that Ihave done this. If so, then we may conclude that it is no part of theconcept of pain that pains must be private, internal sensations. Certain philosophers will sometimes object to exercises such as the one just gone through here, by protesting that the results are ' linguisti-cally deviant '. They might put their objection by saying, \" Y u cannot o say such things. \" By this they mean, not to deny that one can utter cer-tain sentences, but that if one does, then one speaks nonsense. \" Nomeaning has been given in ordinary English \", they might say, \" to anexpression such as ' a publicly sensed pain in a nonliving physicalobject '. \" My reply is: The possible-worlds tale, once told, explainshow the notion might apply, and thus succeeds - if there had not beenan intelligible sense previously - in giving us that sense. If the notionwas ' linguistically deviant ', then it is no longer; if \" public, objectivepain \" has heretofore lacked a sense, then it has one now. A conceptneed not apply to anything actual to be intelligible. There may neverhave been any unicor ns, but the concept of unicor n is intelligible; there may never be any public, objective pains, but the concept of apublic, objective pain is perfectly intelligible.130 Beyond Experience 7.2 Case study: Unfelt pains The sensing of pains (e.g. headaches) is usually regarded as quite unlike the sensing of ' external ' objects (e.g. tables and chairs). Exter-nal objects, we usually think, are not dependent upon our experiencingthem for their existence: they can - and usually do - exist without ourexperiencing them. But pains are usually thought to be different sortsof things. P ins are thought to exist only insofar as they are experi- a enced. A pain must be someone or other 's pain; there are no suchthings as ' free floating ', unexperienced pains, in the way, for example,a chair may exist without being experienced. T account for this o alleged difference, some philosophers adopt different theories of per-ception for external physical objects (e.g. tables and chairs), on theone hand, and internal ' feelings ' (e.g. headaches, ennui, anxiety,euphoria, fear), on the other. F r the rst kind of experience, they will o adopt what is called an \" act / object \" or \" relational \" theory of experi-ence. The experiencer is regarded as being in a perceptual relationship 3with a certain kind of ' object '. F r the second kind of experience, o they will adopt what is called an \" adverbial \" theory of experience. Onthis latter account, the experiencer is not aware of an ' object ', but ishaving a certain kind of sensation. P in, for example, on this account a is regarded not as the object of an act of sensing, but is regarded assensing in a certain way . These two theories are not so much competing theories as they are complementary. They are designed to account for different kinds of experience. And it is thus possible for a person to subscribe to both ofthese theories without inconsistency. But how viable is the alleged distinction which prompts the creating of the relational and the adverbial theories of experience? Is theresomething about the ' felt aspect ' (the phenomenology*) of sensingcolors, for example, which is different from the ' felt aspect ' of havinga pain, a difference which warrants our creating, and subscribing to,two different theories of experience? If the difference is not to beaccounted for by anything inherent in the nature of the sensationsthemselves, then might it be something we lear n, through science,about the nature of this world? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. W will here ignore the various versions of this rst theory. W willee ignore, for example, whether the ' objects ' of perception are physical objectsor what some philosophers have called \" sense-data \" or \" sensa \".Putting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 131 a Two thousand years ago, Plato created one of the most enduring possible-worlds tales, his famous \" Allegory of the Cave \" ([156], book V I I). He asked us to imagine persons growing up, chained in a dark cave so that they could see only straight ahead. On the wall in front ofthem were the shadows of moving objects which themselves were outof sight. (A moder n version would be a person in a movie theater whois restrained so as to be able to see only the images on the screen andnothing more.) In particular, the chained person is unable to moveabout, to touch any of the things he sees. He can talk to other personswho are similarly chained, but none of them can see or touch oneanother. Plato 's purpose in telling this particular possible-worlds tale(what he called an \" allegory \" or a \" parable \") was to argue that ordi-nary perception stands to reality as shadows do to the objects whichcast them. I want to make quite another use of his story. There are, to be sure, profound problems with the story as originally told. Putting aside questions of the unethicalness of chaining innocentpersons in such abominable conditions, it is very unlikely that personswho are raised from childhood prevented from moving about andexamining physical things ever could lear n a language. P rsons raised e in Plato 's cave would be worse off than feral children, i.e. childrenraised not by human beings but by animals. Such children do notacquire language ([77], 246-8). But we will ignore these complica-tions and pretend that the chained prisoners can see, talk, and hear,and that they occasionally feel pain, anxiety, hunger, and the like.What would they make of such sensations? In particular, would theyhave any reason to think that visual sensations and auditory sensa-tions, for example, were any more like one another than either was 4like the sensations of pain and hunger? In not being able to explore \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. Jean-P ul Sartre (1905-80) writes: \" ... if I hear voices, what proof is there a that they come from heaven and not from hell, or from the subconscious, or apathological condition? What proves that they are addressed to me? ... If avoice addresses me, it is always for me to decide that this is the angel 'svoice \" ([185], 19-20). Sartre 's pre-eminent concer n is our ability, indeed ourbeing condemned, to make choices. That overweening interest sometimesmakes Sartre overlook some very obvious distinctions. Under certain cir-cumstances it might be rational to attribute a voice to another person, or to an angel, or to the effects of a drug, etc. P rhaps for dramatic purpose in this e passage Sartre has suppressed these distinctions; but surely they matter. Howdo we go about sorting out the origins of the voices we hear? Only by being able to interact physically with other persons and with material objects. When132 Beyond Experience the world, they would have no warrant whatever for associating their visual sensations with images on a distant wall or their auditory sensa-tions with vibrations in the larynxes of other human beings. W uld o they have any reason, then, to believe that these visual and auditorysensations were of external objects, while pain and hunger were not? Under the circumstances described, there would seem to be no grounds whatsoever to prompt the distinction between ' internal ' and' external ': sensations would simply exist and that would be the end ofit. Why should they attribute to other persons the ' voices ' whichanswer their questions? These ' voices ' just appear in their auditoryspaces, just as hunger pangs occur from time to time in their gustatory 5spaces, and colors in their visual spaces. Without being able to moveabout the world, they would regard all sensations on an equal footingin that their sensations would flit in and out of consciousness. Colorswould be different from sounds, both would differ from smells, and allwould differ from pains. But other than the fact that colors, smells,sounds, and pains would all for m distinct categories, there would beno grounds on which to regard any of them as ' internal ' or any as' external '. If a conclusion can be drawn from our use of Plato 's myth, it would be that there is nothing inherent or intrinsic in the having of a sensa-tion which marks it as ' external ' or ' internal ', as being betterexplained by a relational theory of experience than by an adverbialtheory. Why we treat colors and sounds as ' objects ' and pains as' manners of sensation ' has to do, not with the phenomenology ofthese sensations, but with certain empirical facts we discover aboutthis world. W discover empirically - experimentally and not intro- e spectively - that other persons share our visual sensations but do notshare our pain sensations. A.J. A er put the point this way, in his own possible-worlds tale:y Suppose, for example, that people 's feelings were very much \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 the latter opportunities are denied to us, then - and only then - might our decision as to the cause of the voice come down to a matter of ' choice '. F r o ordinary circumstances, Sartre has considerably overstated the role of choice.But for Plato 's cave, where the denizens are physically restrained and unableto probe their environment, something like Sartre 's (arbitrary) choice is theironly recourse. 5. W will have more to say of this use of \" space \" in the next chapter.ePutting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 133 a more unifor m than they actually are, so that whenever anyone felt bored, or happy or angry, or depressed, his neighboursnearly always felt the same. In that case, we might very wellnd use for saying that there was not a multiplicity of feelings,one to each person, but a single feeling, one and the same forall, which different people experienced in different ways. Cer-tain people might fail to experience it at all, just as certainpeople fail to perceive physical objects which are in theirneighbourhood. There might be illusions of feeling, corre-sponding to illusions of perception. But the feeling would stillbe there, just as the physical object is there whatever illusionsomeone may be having. T make the analogy with physical o objects closer still, one might make it possible [by telling a pos-sible-worlds tale] for feelings to exist when no one was actuallyfeeling them. This might be said in cases where the normalconditions in which the feeling habitually occurred werepresent, but some special factor, such as the drugging orhypnotizing of the person in question, intervened. ... The point of this fantasy is to show how the distinction be- tween what is public and what is private depends upon a con-tingent matter of fact . W do not nd it useful to publicize [i.e.e regard as being public] feelings, or sensations, or thoughts, orimages, because they vary so much from person to person: wedo nd it useful to publicize physical objects because of theextent to which the perceptions of different people agree. But itis not difcult to imagine that the two should be on a level, oreven that the position should be reversed. ([18], 201-2; italicsadded) F r A er, what makes for the ' internality ' of pains and the ' exter-oy nality ' of tables and chairs is something we discover, not by examin-ing our own pain sensations, our own visual sensations, our own tac-tile sensations, etc., but by examining the world and the reports ofother persons. F r A er, it is a contingent fact about this world, nothing inherent ino y the nature of pain sensation itself, that pains are not public objects like tables and chairs, and that pains do not exist unperceived. A er is y quite prepared to allow (as I have argued in section 7.1) that painscould be public, shareable sensations. And A er goes one step further. y He suggests that, were the world a certain way, we would want toacknowledge the existence of unperceived pains. If a pain can be134 Beyond Experience experienced by several persons (again, see section 7.1), then were one of those persons to be shielded from the pain, by medication,hypnosis, etc., the situation would be perfectly analogous to a person 'sbeing shielded from perceiving a physical object by, e.g., blindfoldinghim or erecting a wall across his eld of view. Just as the obscuredphysical object would still be regarded as existing, although not per-ceived, so too would it be reasonable to regard the pain as still existingalthough it, too, was not being perceived. In short, unfelt pains are no logical impossibility. That they do not exist is an empirical discovery we have made about this particularworld. There is nothing inherent in the concept of pain, or in thesensation of pain, to preclude public, shareable pains, pains which canexist without being felt by anyone. The alleged differences whichhave prompted the creating of two side-by-side theories of experience,the relational and the adverbial theories, are differences which are notinherent in the nature of sensation itself but only in empirical facts wehave discovered about other persons. 7.3 Case study: P ins in the absence of nervous systems a In the last one hundred years, we have lear ned enough about neurophysiology to be able to say condently that our pains are, withvirtual certainty, attributable to chemical and electrical activity (i.e.certain specic physical ' goings-on ') in specic substructures of ourcentral nervous systems. Even in cases of so-called psychosomaticpains, we have good reason to believe that often, if not always, suchpains are, again, attributable to physical goings-on, although, unlikethe cases of physical injuries and trauma, not originating in lesions,bruises, infections, etc. In short, we are much inclined - being knowl-edgeable of some of the data of moder n medical research - to attributethe sensing of pains to physical activity in our bodies. The possible-worlds tale of section 7.1 - which told of the sensing of an out-of-body pain (the strange affair of Michael Robins andothers) - still capitalized upon, indeed invoked, the very account beingreviewed here. Although the ' initiating cause ' of the distant pain wasnot the ring of the sensitive ending of a peripheral nerve, the painsensed did come about because of certain activity in the spinal cordand the brain. T that degree, that tale did not depart from contem- o porary scientic accounts. Nevertheless, in spite of this familiar scientic background, I want to insist upon a conceptual distinction between pains or, better, ' thePutting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 135 a felt aspect of pains ' and their physical origins. This particular distinc- tion, between pains (or the felt aspect of pains) and their specicphysical origins in the central nervous system, is one of the mosttroublesome for some persons to grasp, and takes us right to the heartof one of the most difcult and controversial distinctions in philoso-phy, one which some writers insist upon and which others reject. Suppose, as I am perfectly willing to concede as being highly prob- able, that all pains without exception are attributable to certain kindsof physical goings-on in a living creature, and suppose, further, thatwhenever there is an occasion (episode) of such physical goings-onthere is a felt pain. At least two theories, as we have earlier seen, havebeen proposed to explain such correlations: either the pain literally is the physical goings-on themselves (this is part of the so-called identitytheory of mind and brain) or the pain is caused by the physical goings-on (the so-called causal theory). But whichever of these theo-ries we might want eventually to settle upon, I would still want toinsist upon the conceptual difference between one 's pains and physi- cal goings-on in one 's body. Now this latter claim - that pains are conceptually distinct from the states of the central nervous system which ' account for ' the presenceof those pains - is bound to strike some persons as particularlystrange. F r how can I, on the one hand, allow that pains might liter- o ally be physical goings-on and yet, on the other hand, insist on the conceptual difference between pains and physical events or states? It all depends, of course, on what exactly is meant by ' a conceptual dis-tinction '. In the analysis I have been proposing, two concepts are distinct if, for each of them, it is logically possible for there to be a situation (thing, event, state, etc.) to which that concept applies and not theother one. According to this analysis, then, one can say that there is aconceptual distinction between having a pain and having the brain-state which ' gives rise to ' (or even ' is ') that very pain, if it is logically possible to apply the one concept to an organism and not the other. But as so often happens in philosophy, we have answered one ques- tion only in tur n to have prompted another. F r now the question o arises, \" How shall we tell when attributing one concept to a thingwhile withholding another is logically possible? \" W can of course e say such a thing as \" He is in pain, but nothing is happening to him physically to account for that pain \", but we also know that it is pos-sible to say things which (if taken literally) describe logically impos-sible situations, e.g. \" He traveled across town in an empty taxi \" or136 Beyond Experience \" Her elder brother is an only child. \" Being able to say something does not make what is said logically possible. The test for logical possibil-ity must be something else. Again, we invoke the technique of constructing a possible-worlds tale. T show that there is a conceptual difference between the twoo concepts, we might attempt not just to utter a single sentence or two,but to ll in details, to tell a more robust tale, in which it is appropriateto apply one of the two concepts to the situation and explicitly with-hold the other. If this can be done without contradiction , then this may be taken as evidence that the two concepts are - after all - distinct. Thus, in the case of pain, if we want to argue for the conceptual dif- ference between pains and physical goings-on in a central nervoussystem, we might try to construct a possible-worlds tale in which crea-tures experienced pain but in which those same creatures did not havethe physical goings-on that are usual when you and I feel pain. Here issuch a tale. Once upon a time there was a universe in which there was a planet, Htraenon, very like Earth in certain respects but veryunlike it in others. Outwardly its creatures resembled those ofEarth remarkably, but internally they were surprisingly different.The ' human beings ' of that planet looked pretty much as human beings do on Earth: each had a head, two eyes, two ears, anose, a mouth, two ar ms, a torso, two legs, ten ngers, and tentoes. By our own standards, we would consider all of themextremely good-looking. Their social life was much like ours aswell: they laughed, told jokes, complimented one another,prayed, sang songs, elected ofcials, instituted moral codes,educated their children, exchanged goods and services formoney, and occasionally indulged in metaphysical specula-tions. They were also subject to many of the same sorts of ail-ments and frailties that befall the likes of you and me. They hadillnesses, they suffered occasional pains, they sought medicaltreatment, they grew old, and each of them eventually died. Butin one respect they were very different from us. Up until about the time they began to use microscopes and electronic devices in medicine, their history and science wereunfolding in a parallel fashion to our own. But once they beganto examine the internal functionings of their own bodies, usingdevices much more sensitive than their own eyes and ears,Putting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 137 a they discovered a physiology which is remarkably different from yours and mine. F r one thing, they had no central nervous o system. It is not that they failed to nd such a thing. It wentbeyond that: they really had no central nervous system at all.Now failing to nd a central nervous system did not surprisethem in the slightest. After all, they had had no reason tohypothesize, and even less reason to believe, that such a thingexisted. They had no beliefs attributing their pains to specicgoings-on in a central nervous system, no more so than theyhad beliefs at the beginning of their moder n period of chemistryabout glands in their bodies releasing hormones to regulate, forexample, the level of glucose in their bloodstreams. In time, as their science grew in sophistication and they con- tinued to perfor m physiological, chemical, and microscopicexaminations of their own bodies, they discovered within them-selves a hormonal system, came to understand its regulatoryfunctions, and even managed to synthesize all of these hor-mones in their pharmaceutical laboratories. But they nevermade comparable discoveries about a central nervous system,and this for the aforementioned reason that they did not have acentral nervous system. Thus, it was inevitable that thesepeople simply persisted with their timewor n theory that pains,thoughts, musings, etc. were somehow features or characteris-tics of themselves, but did not think it necessary, or warranted,to attribute them to any particular physical goings-on in theirbodies. When, in due course, several centuries later, scientists from a distant galaxy arrived on Htraenon for the rst time and dis-covered that the Htraenonites had no central nervous systems,they were initially dumbfounded. But soon, the incredulity of thevisiting scientists crumbled. After only a few weeks adjusting tosuch an unexpected jolt to their beliefs about the physiology ofsensations, most of these latter scientists found themselvesworking handily with the idea that some creatures (themselves,for example) feel pain as a result of certain goings-on in theircentral nervous systems, but that other creatures (e.g. theHtraenonites) feel pain without, so far as could be ascertained,anything in particular happening within their bodies, besides theinjuries themselves, which could be correlated with thosesensations.138 Beyond Experience Although the world just described is merely a possible world, i.e. is not this, the actual world, it is meant to mirror the history of the actualworld up to the point in our own history when we began to discoverthe existence of, and the secrets of the functioning of, the central nerv-ous system. Until that point in our own history, we (actual) humanbeings did not associate pains with goings-on in a central nervoussystem. So ignorant were our forebears of the existence and operationsof the central nervous system that we nd in Aristotle, for example,the perfectly serious hypothesis that the brain was nothing more thanan organ to ' cool the blood '. Aristotle knew nothing, nor could hehave, of the manner of connection of certain sensory organs, e.g. oftouch and taste, with the brain. And thus he thought it demonstrablethat the brain was not involved in sensation: \" This brain ... has a character peculiar to itself, as might indeed be expected. That it has nocontinuity with the organs of sense is plain from simple inspection,and is more clearly shown by the fact, that, when it is touched, nosensation is produced. ([12], book I I, 652b1-10) ... Nature has con- trived the brain as a counterpoise to the region of the heart with itscontained heat, and has given it to animals to moderate the latter ...The brain, then, tempers the heat and seething of the heart \"(652b20-7). Did Aristotle - knowing nothing of moder n neurophysiology - have a concept of pain different from ours? Certainly we may suppose that he, like us, had experienced pains. He, doubtless, from time totime, had pricked his nger, cut his hand, stubbed his toe, suffered atoothache, and endured a headache. He was, we may be sure, familiarwith pain in many of its for ms. But he knew nothing of peripheralnerves, of Ad- and C-bers, of electrical pathways in the spinal cord,of the ring of nerve cells, or even for that matter, of the existence ofnerve cells. As a matter of fact, he did not even have the concept ofnerve, of cell, of electricity , of endorphin , etc. Could he, then, have had our concept of pain? I want to suggest that he did, that he could have understood, as well as any of us, claims about persons being inpain, about certain pains being more intense than others, about certainmedications ' ability to relieve pain, about most persons trying to avoidpain, etc. All he would lack is a twenty-rst-century scientic expla-nation of the physiology of pain. But that infor mation ought not, Isuggest, to be regarded as part of the concept of pain itself. Scientists, as they pursue neurophysiology, are not rening the concept of pain, but are furthering our knowledge of pain, its causes, and its relief.Putting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 139 a 7.4 Case study: Must pains hurt? Squares have four sides; the edible parts of pineapples are yellow. But whereas it is part of what we have called the \" narrow \" analysis (i.e. itis analytic) of the concept of square that squares have four sides, it is not part of the analysis of the concept of pineapple that the edible parts of pineapples are yellow. After all, cabbages may be white orpurple; ripe apples may be red, yellow, or green; grapefruits may bewhite or pink; etc. In this age of hybrid fruits and vegetables, we havegrown used to the appearance on grocers ' shelves of produce in anever-increasing variety of colors. T date, all the pineapples on the o market have yellow flesh, but few of us would be unduly surprised todiscover one day a product identical to present-day pineapples butwhich differed in hue, being orange or pink perhaps. Given how wehave handled analogous cases in the past, we probably would not inthe slightest be tempted to argue that these orange-colored fruits werenot pineapples; we would simply allow that pineapples could come inmore than one color. Insofar as it is analytic of the concept square that all squares have four sides, it is impossible to tell a possible-worlds tale, without con-tradiction, in which there are squares having other than four sides, e.g.ve sides. But insofar as being yellow is not analytic of the concept pineapple , it is perfectly possible - as I have just done in previewing a possible future state of this very universe - to describe without inter-nal contradiction a situation in which there are non-yellow (orangeperhaps) pineapples. What about pain? Is being hurtful or causing hurt analytic of the concept of pain? W uld a sensation even be describable as pain if ito did not hurt? Is a non-hurtful pain logically impossible in the way, forexample, a ve-sided square would be? Or, is a non-hurtful pain rathermore like an orange-colored pineapple - unusual to say the least, per-haps never even part of one 's own experience, but logically possiblenonetheless? Once again we take recourse to telling a possible-worldstale, this time in an attempt to describe a pain which does not hurt. Mr. J.R. had very advanced cancer of the neck and jaw. When pain became unbearable despite huge doses of narcotics, afrontal lobotomy was discussed with his family and nally per-for med in an effort to make his last few months comfortable.Under local anesthesia, small drill holes were made in the skull140 Beyond Experience over the frontal lobes, and the bers connecting the frontal cor- tex with the thalamus were severed on both sides by an instru-ment lowered into the brain. F r several days after the opera-o tion he was sleepy and confused, did not know where he was,and had trouble recognizing his family. This cleared, however,and he seemed cheerful and alert. He did not complain of pain and stopped asking for pain medication, but when asked if hestill had pain he said, \" Of course I do, it 's the cancer, right here \", pointing to his diseased jaw. Examination revealed his perception of temperature and pin [pricking] to be acute - heactually \" jumped \" [in response] to the pin prick, and complainedof being \" tortured \", something he had never said before. Most [similarly treated, i.e. lobotomized] patients said, unemotionally, that pressure on the tumor was still painful butthey were obviously not disturbed by the pain. There was achasm between the affective emotional aspect of pain [i.e. itshurting] and the pure sensation of pain. The sensory and emotional aspects of pain can [also] be dis- sociated [from one another] by certain drugs. F r example, high o doses of antianxiety agents such as certain tranquilizers do notseriously impair discrimination between stimuli ranging frompainless to extremely painful. However, even though subjectsmay report certain stimuli as being excruciatingly painful theydo not seem to care. The drug appears to leave the sensoryaspects of pain intact, while almost completely suppressing theemotional aspects. Is such a tale really possible? Is it really possible - as this tale alleges - to feel a pain and yet not have it hurt? It tur ns out that it is possible, indeed that it can be proven to be possible. And it can beproven in the strongest fashion in which we can prove anything pos-sible: by showing that the alleged possibility is actual. The possible-worlds tale just told - of patients who could feel pain but who experienced no hurt - is not the product of a philosopher 'simagination as were the tales of the three preceding sections, but is 6compiled from actual clinical studies. This assembled story is, of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. The rst of the three paragraphs indented just above is a direct quotation from Basic Human Neurophysiology , by Lindsley and Holmes ([123], 117); the second, from The Nervous System , by P ter Nathan ([142], 105); and theePutting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 141 a course, still a possible-worlds tale. Its only difference from the usual possible-worlds tales of philosophical texts is that this one happens tobe true (i.e. is true not just in some other possible worlds, but is true in this, the actual world, as well). Someone might object: \" P ins which do not hurt are a logical a impossibility. There cannot be, in this world or any other, pains whichdo not hurt. The patients who described themselves as feeling painswhich did not hurt had misdescribed the situation. They certainly had some sensation; but just insofar as it did not hurt, then it was not pain.P rhaps we currently lack a ter m for such sensations in our language,e the phenomenon being so rare. Nonetheless, such sensations cannot bedescribed as pains. Whether we have a name for them or not, theymust be regarded as something other than pains. \" The possible-worlds tale just told, then, will not be convincing to everyone. As we can see, it is possible for someone to reject theapparent conclusion of such a tale by arguing that the persons in thetale are misdescribing their sensations. How, now, can we possiblyresolve this latter debate? The possible-worlds tale may at rst seemconvincing to some persons (it is to me, for one), but others can - ifthey are inclined - nd grounds to reject it. At this point we must be very careful not to think that there is some one ' right ' or ' wrong ' answer to the question. There would be only ifthere were some independent way, other than our agreeing to use a concept in a certain way, to ascertain when a concept is used correctlyor incorrectly. But there is no such way. Our concepts are our owninventions. W do not discover them. If concepts were not of our mak- e ing, but the sorts of things we could examine to see what is ' really 'entailed by them and what not, then we could - theoretically - dis-cover, for example, that we have had the concept of square wrong all these many years. W had thought that all squares are four-sided, but e having now examined the concept of square we see that we had madea mistake: squares may have either ve or eleven sides. It is clear thatsuch a notion would be nonsense. There is no such independent con-cept of square that, if we are careful and attentive, some of us will get right, but if we are careless, all of us might get wrong. It is impossiblefor everyone to have a mistaken notion of square. The question boils down to this. Virtually any pain any of us has \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 third, from The Neurosciences and Behaviour , by Atrens and Curthoys ([14], 93).142 Beyond Experience ever felt has hurt. Is the hurting to be identied with the pain - in the sense that nothing logically could be a pain if it did not hurt - or might- given the pressures of certain kinds of peculiar circumstances - wewant to allow that not all pains hurt? The cancer sufferers who underwent the frontal lobotomies outlined above described their sensations, at the sites where they for merly hadpain, as still being pain. The difference, they alleged, was not in theirceasing to feel pain but in that pain 's no longer hurting. The concept of pain, like so many other concepts - e.g. of person, of fairness, of duty, of consciousness - is in a state of flux. If we are to judge by the on-the-spot linguistic behavior of medical patients andmedical practitioners who are involved with the amelioration of pain,all the indicators are that our language is evolving toward making adistinction between sensing a pain and experiencing hurt. The twoconcepts are coming apart. If, someday, a safe medication is devel-oped which - unlike the opiates, which suppress the sensation of painaltogether - acts like the chemical equivalent of a frontal lobotomy orlike a massive dose of certain tranquilizers in that it (here I must usecurrent terminology) suppresses not the pain, but only the accompany-ing feeling of hurt, we will be hastened toward making a sharp distinc-tion between the two concepts. It may even happen that persons in thefuture will wonder how it was that we ever confused the two, so usedwill they have become to taking a tablet when they have a headache torelieve, not the pain, but the hurt. What, then, shall we nally conclude? Does the concept of pain include the concept of hurting? I think the answer must be something like this. So frequently are pains accompanied by hurting that weinvariably tend to conflate the two concepts. Even so, they can (in myopinion), reasonably, be regarded as logically, or conceptually, dis-tinct. And given certain as yet unrealized developments in medicalresearch, we would in time virtually be forced to use these conceptsseparately. W have enough empirical data now in hand to suggest e that our language just might evolve in that direction. W cannot e foretell with any certainty that it will, however. From a philosophical point of view, all we can do is to prepare ourselves for that even- 7tuality. W must be sufciently flexible in using our concepts so that e \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7. \"When the hypothetical upheaval is sufciently radical we have to go through the agonizingly innovative process of rebuilding part of our concep-tual scheme from the ground up. Genuine conceptual innovation is necessaryPutting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 143 a we are prepared for the kind of intellectual reorientation that might be required. Summary of sections 7.1-7.4: F r the purposes of illustrating oneo way in which philosophers probe concepts, I have subjected the con-cept of pain to analysis by invoking it in a number of possible-worlds tales in which some quite extraordinary situations have been de-scribed. I have tried to show four things: that although pains typicallyoccur within our skins, that although all pains are felt, that althoughpains typically are the product of nervous systems, and that althoughpains typically hurt, none of these features is logically entailed by theconcept of pain. It is possible, I have tried to show, that pains could (logically speaking) occur outside our skins, and even for that mattermight be public in the way in which tables, sounds, and aromas arepublic, more particularly, might exist unperceived; that pains could(logically speaking) occur in creatures which lacked central nervoussystems; and that, nally, pains could (logically speaking) occurwithout a sensation of accompanying hurt. My expectation is that ofthe several things being claimed, the last - that pains could occurwithout there being a sensation of hurt - will be the most difcult formany readers to accept. And yet, of the several, it is the one for whichthere is the best empirical evidence. The point of pursuing such exercises is threefold. First and foremost, some persons nd such conceptual explorations fascinating.F r such persons, that alone merits the pursuit. The second justica-o tion lies in the sharpening of our conceptual tools. Only in understand-ing what is and what is not entailed by our concepts can we aspire touse them well. If we are going to think, then our thinking cannot beany better than the tools we use. If the tools are dull, the product willbe rough and crude. If the tools are well made, and their interrelationsunderstood, then at least we have a chance of making something beau-tiful and useful with them. W can no more do philosophy well with- e out critically examining our concepts than we could do genetics with-out a microscope or physics without mathematics. The third point of the exercise is to unfetter our imaginations. In \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and there is no way of predicting its outcome. T the question ' What would o you say if ...? ' we would in such cases have to reply: ' W just wouldn 't e know what to say . . . W 'll just have to cross that bridge when we get there ' \" e (Rescher [169], 114).144 Beyond Experience arguing that certain concepts are not essential to the concept of pain, I have been attempting to enlarge the possible application of the concept. By peeling away inessentials, I have tried, not to narrow ourconcept of pain, but to stretch it. Although pains typically, per- haps always, occur within the bodies of creatures having nervoussystems, and although pains usually hurt, might we not want to con-sider the possibility of pains outside of bodies, in things quite unlikeus in structure, and unaccompanied by hurt? Only in imagining possi-bilities beyond the commonplace have we any hope of understandingthis world. F r understanding this universe (or any other one) consists o in large measure in seeing the difference between what might be , what is, and what must be. P stscript (Added, second edition)o This chapter. in which I have argued for (among other things) the conceptual possibility of pains existing outside of one 's body, indeedeven being shared by two or more persons, has proven exceedinglytroublesome for some readers. One reviewer of Beyond Experience singled out this chapter for special comment: ... a (rare) place where S artz 's discussion loses credibility is w his alleged possible world (see pp. 118 ff.) where we would callsomething a pain that was literally outside of our body. While itis fun and often enlightening to envisage possible worlds,surely the experience of pain, the having a pain, is always inone 's brain. In the actual world, pains are private because theyare brain states. If S artz is trying to show only that they might w not have been brain states, he would be right. But so long aspains are experiences and not objects of perception, they cannotsensibly be said to be shared (unless by Siamese twins sharinga brain) or public. P ins could not literally be out of the body a and at the same time experiences. If we imagine a world wherepains are analogous to colours, of course, this is not necessarilytrue. \u2014Jack Or nstein, Canadian Philosophical Review , vol. XII (2)-(5) (April 1992-Oct. 1992), p. 355. By way of defense, I would reply that if pains can be likened (there are of course differences) to tactile sensations, then there is not only aPutting Concepts under Stress ( I I ) - P ins 144.1 a conceptual possibility of having pain sensations outside of one 's body, there has been, more recently, actual laboratory evidence bearing onthe question. I reproduce here an article (appearing seven years afterthis chapter was rst published and six years after Or nstein 's critique)reporting an experiment that demonstrates, not merely the possibility,but the reality of out-of-body tactile sensations. (Sometimes, it tur ns out, philosophical theorizing presages scientic discovery.) This Here Hand Is My Hand, I Think P rticipants in a recent psychological study will probably nevera look at mannequins - or their own bodies - in quite the sameway again. Before the study, they knew their ar ms belonged tothem and synthetic ones didn 't, simply because seeing isbelieving. Now they 're not so sure. Researchers at Car negie Mellon University in Pittsburgh asked subjects to keep their eyes on a rubber ar m that wassitting on a table in front of them, With the subject 's left ar mhidden from view by a screen, the researchers simultaneouslystroked both the rubber hand and the subject 's hand with apaintbrush. Even though they knew their own hand was beingstroked behind the screen, nearly all the subjects experiencedthe same bizarre sensation: they felt the fake hand was actuallytheir own. According to Matthew Botvinick, the Ph.D. psychology student who coauthored the study with advisor Jonathan Cohen,awareness of self seems to depend on intricate conversationsbetween the brain and a range of sensory inputs that itconstantly receives. If those conversations become garbled bycontradictory messages, the brain is even willing to stretch thebounds of where the body ends and the outside world begins inorder to draw a coherent picture. \" It 's like ventriloquism, \" says Botvinick, who was so spooked by the illusion when he tested it on himself that he letout a yelp and threw the fake hand across the room. \" In theexperiment, when something touches the fake hand, you feel it,so the rubber hand appears to be an object with which yousense. And when there is an object of that kind, it 's usually partof you. That seems to be one basis of self-identication. \" T conr m that the subjects were experiencing a true shift ino144.2 Beyond Experience their perception of themselves, researchers asked them to run their right index nger along the underside of the table until itwas directly under neath their left one. Those who had experi-enced the rubber-hand illusion invariably missed their real n-ger altogether and pointed more closely to the fake hand. \" When you look at your hand, it doesn 't feel as if your brain might be going through all kinds of complicated computationsto arrive at the conclusion that this thing is yours, \" says Botvin-ick. \" Y u just know it 's your hand. \" \u2014Jennifer V n Ezra, inoa the column \"Nexus\" in Equinox, no. 99 (July 1998), p. 14.C H A P T E R E I G H T Space and time In our conversation, no word is more familiarly used or more easily recognized than \" time \". W certainly understand what is e meant by the word both when we use it ourselves and when wehear it used by others. What, then, is time? I know well enough what it is, provided that nobody asks me; but if I am asked what it is and try to ex-plain, I am baffled. - St Augustine ( A D 354-430), Confessions ([15], 264) Augustine 's dilemma is one all of us have experienced frequently in our lives, not only about time, but space, morality, justice, education,art, etc. W are perfectly capable of using these concepts in our ordi- e nary affairs; but we seem unable to give an explication, or - better - atheoretical reconstruction, of these concepts. All of us understand theconcept of time well enough to schedule meetings, to set alar m clocks,to time a cake 's baking, and the like. But if asked \" What is time? \",most persons - like Augustine - would not know how to answer. 8.1 Is it possible to explain what space and time are?Time and again when I was a student in public school, my teachers solemnly insisted: \" In spite of everything we know about electricity, wedo not know what electricity is. \" This verdict about electricity can be found, too, in many books of the period. T use P pper 's phrase (he o o \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The rst page of chapter one in The Boy Electrician , which I read count- less times as a youngster, reads, in part: Electrical science ... has brought us the telephone, radio, elec- tric lights, motors, sound pictures, television, new materials,medicines, and a host of other things. And all of these wonders have been invented and perfected by men who did not know what electricity is. No one knows what electricity is. There have been many theories or attempts to explain what this mysterious force may actually be, but all of them have been mere guesses and cannot146 Beyond Experience was speaking of objections to Einstein 's relativity theories; [159], 34), this was - in the end - just a piece of \" popular nonsense \". What made that slogan nonsense stemmed from a certain presupposi- tion that prompted it. When asked to explain what it meant to say \" Wedo not know what electricity is \", my teachers would often reply with something of the sort, \" W know that electrical phenomena arise out of e the movement of charged particles, and we know many of the physicallaws involved, but however much knowledge we gain of this sort, itwill never tell us what electricity is. \" I have no doubt that my teachers were well-intentioned, that they honestly believed that this was alegitimate thing to say and to impart to their students. But in the end, itis nonsense nonetheless. It is nonsense because as a general principle it would deny that we know of anything at all what it is. There is nothing special in this regard about electricity. What my teachers alleged to be a peculiar problemwith electricity could just as well have been said about glass, the wind,your nose, prot, or freedom. And quite contrary to their argument, weknow what things are precisely by knowing what their makeup is, whatsorts of physical laws describe their behavior, how they typically act,and how we make use of them. W know, for example, a great deal e about the wind. W understand that the wind is not the exhalation of a e god but is movement within the atmosphere in which we live. W have e lear ned, too, that air is made up of a mixture of various gases, that airmoves because of differential heating (due to the Sun 's heat, ocean cur-rents, concentrated bur ning of fossil fuels, etc.) and because of theCoriolis force (due to the rotation of the Earth), and that air may movein laminar or turbulent ways. And we have lear ned, over a period ofcenturies by trial and error and more recently with the greater efciencyconferred by having mathematical theories of gas dynamics, to harnessthe wind (in windmills, for example). Once we know these sorts ofthings, even if our knowledge is incomplete, even if, for example, wecannot predict or explain the behavior of the wind as precisely as wemight like, we know what the wind is. And the same may be said for electricity: once we know the atomic nature of electrical phenomena,have discovered a great many of the physical laws of those phenomena,have harnessed electricity in our generators, machines, radios, com-puters, and the like, we may perfectly reasonably say, \" F r the most o \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 be proven.

Reprinted byLindsay Publications Inc., Bradley IL, 1995.Space and Time 147 part, we know what electricity is. \" Of course we cannot sum up this ex- tensive knowledge in a brief paragraph. A good understanding ofelectricity comes about only after several weeks or months of study.But it is something attainable with effort. It is certainly nothing un-knowable in principle . The moral should also be applied for space and for time. Just as in the case of electricity, many persons have, like Augustine, convincedthemselves that there is something deeply mysterious about space andtime and that space and time are so inscrutable as to be unknowable . \" In spite of everything we know about space and time, we really do notknow what space and time are \", I think many persons are inclined to think to themselves. Certainly there are problems about space and time,but the pessimistic belief that space and time are somehow so enigmaticas to be fundamentally unknowable strikes me as a piece of popular non-sense which ought to be excised just like the nonsense about electricity. What does coming to know what space and time are consist in? The answer, I suggest, is perfectly straightforward: it consists, simply, inour having an account which is, rst of all, free of internal inconsis-tency, and, secondly, robust enough both to make sense of our ordinaryuses of these concepts and to allow us to do physics. Common,everyday notions of space and time, as Augustine noted seventeen cen-turies ago, are in quite good enough shape for ordinary affairs. But theyare not in particularly good shape for sophisticated thinking about theuniverse writ large. Buber, we have earlier seen, had tried to imagine an edge of space and a beginning and end to time and found that he was unable to imag-ine that there could be such things and (unfortunately for him) was un- able to imagine that there could not be such things. Recall (from p. 10 above): \" A necessity I could not understand swept over me: I had to tryagain and again to imagine the edge of space, or its edgelessness, timewith a beginning and an end or a time without beginning or end, andboth were equally impossible, equally hopeless - yet there seemed to beonly the choice between the one or the other absurdity \" ([37], 135-6). In this passage, Buber, writing years later, correctly - but unwittingly - diagnoses the source of the problem: the very ideas at play are ' ab-surd '. But he never clearly plumbed the absurdity, either as a teenageror as a mature philosopher relating his youthful experience. The source of Buber 's difculty is an untenable concept of space. It is deeply and irremediably flawed, for it leads, as we see explicitly inBuber 's narrative, to incoherence. In Kant 's terminology, this particularconcept of space was beset by ' antinomies '. In moder n terminology wewould deem it ' paradoxical '.148 Beyond Experience Leibniz, in contrast, had a signicantly different concept of space. In 1spite of certain difculties in his theory of space, I am tempted to say that in the fundamental insight which infor med his theory, Leibniz ' gotit right '. However, if I were to put my praise in just that way, I wouldundercut what I said earlier about philosophical reconstructions, viz.that they cannot be judged to be true or false. So, forgoing the claimthat Leibniz ' got it right ', I am inclined to say that Leibniz 's account isvastly superior to the common view and, with some repairs, can bemade to work reasonably well. (Hereafter, I will refer to the theorybeing offered below as the \" neo-Leibnizian \" theory. The qualication\" neo \" connotes that what follows adopts the core of Leibniz 's originaltheory, but is not to be thought to preserve the whole of that historicaltheory.) Let me state the essential element in the neo-Leibnizian theoryof space in an initially provocative manner, using a for m of words onlyslightly different from Leibniz 's own: Space does not exist. The neo-Leibnizian theory can equally be characterized as being the ' negative ' theory of space. It argues, in effect, that there is nothingmore to the concept of space than that places are dependent on the 2existence of physical objects. T ke away those objects and there are no a ' places '. In imagination annihilate all the matter of the universe.Having done so, in no intelligible sense can you then go on to say:\" This is the place where the Andromeda galaxy used to be. \" Withoutphysical things, there are no places. T say of a world devoid of physi- o cal objects that one place might be distinguished from another would beof the same order of nonsense as to say that someone might vacate aroom and leave her lap behind. Just as a lap is a spatial feature of onephysical object, places are spatial features of two (or more) physical ob-jects. In the absence of physical objects, there are no places. Still less isthere a ' physical space ' which might be thought to be the conglomera-tion of all places. But having now stated the thesis - that space does not exist, that there are only things and their places - in a deliberately provocativeway, let me try now both to explain what I mean by this and to defend(what must surely appear at the outset to be) an outrageous claim. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. F r instance, Leibniz denied both that spatial relations are ' real ' and that ao vacuum is a possibility. Both of these claims are, however, peripheral to hismain thesis, and I wish only to pursue his main thesis. 2. On some contemporary interpretations of moder n physics, some writers suggest that physical objects are best conceived of as clumps or distributionsof energy. That renement is inessential for our purposes.Space and Time 149 8.2 A neo-Leibnizian theory of space It is a truth of logic that any class of things can be divided, without remainder, into two mutually exclusive subclasses. Roses, for example,may be divided into all those that are red and all those that are not red.Mammals, for example, may be divided into those that are marsupialsand those that are not. And similarly for theories of space, which maybe divided into those theories which posit space as a subtle (ethereal)kind of ' stuff ' permeating the universe and those theories which do notso regard space. Isaac Newton, like most persons, subscribed to a theory of the rst kind, although Newton 's theory, as we would expect, was considerablymore robust than most persons '. Motivated in part by a Cartesian* theo-ry of perception and in part by certain theological beliefs, he positedthat space was, in his words, ' the sensorium of God ', a kind of ' senseorgan ' by which God was able immediately to know the place(whereabouts) of anything in the universe. W will not concer n our- e selves with these latter sorts of subsidiary features of Newton 's theory.What is essential in his theory was that it was one of the kind whichregarded space as a ' container ' of the physical objects in the universe. Most persons, I am quite sure, subscribe to a ' container ' theory of space. When they say such a thing as \" There are many galaxies scat-tered about in space \", they will often imagine a picture, just on agrander scale, similar to that imagined when they say, for example,\" The Eiffel T wer is located in P ris. \" Just as the Eiffel T wer and oa o P ris may each be regarded as a kind of spatial object (although ofa course the latter is a rather large spatial object, occupying some 106square kilometers), the common view would have it that galaxies, too,are physical objects (very big ones) and that they are located in space,viz. a yet larger container (a kind of ' super-P ris ' as it were) which is, a nonetheless, a ' somewhat physical ' sort of thing. The reasoning is byanalogy: the Eiffel T wer (a physical thing having spatial properties) is o in P ris (also a physical thing having spatial properties), and thusa galaxies (physical things having physical properties), being in space,must be in a thing (i.e. space) which in its tur n is a physical thinghaving spatial properties. This ' container ' model of space is unquestionably the one presup- posed by Buber. He conceived of space as a kind of stuff of which itwas appropriate (meaningful) to speculate where its edge might lie. F r o containers, whether they be something as small as jam jars or as largeas P ris, have outer bounds: there clearly are places which lie on thea ' inside ' (i.e. are within) and there are other places which lie on the150 Beyond Experience ' outside ' (i.e. are without). But, as we have seen (p. 10 above), Buber nearly went insane trying to reconcile himself to operating with thismodel of space. Leibniz strongly attacked the ' container ' model of space. His par- ticular challenge was to Newton 's particular version, but it need notbe regarded as so restricted. His objections, and his alter native theory,can be read as applying to any version of the ' container ' theory. \u00a72. ... real absolute space ... is an idol of some moder n Englishmen. I call it an idol, not in a theological sense, but in aphilosophical one. ... \u00a73. These gentlemen maintain ... thatspace is a real absolute being. But this involves them in greatdifculties; for such a being must needs be eternal and innite.Hence some have believed it to be God himself, or, one of hisattributes, his immensity. But since space consists of parts, it isnot a thing which can belong to God. \u00a74. As for my ownopinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to besomething merely relative, as time is; that I hold it to be anorder of coexistences, as time is an order of successions. F r o space denotes, in ter ms of possibility, an order of things whichexist at the same time, considered as existing together. ([5],Third paper, 25-6) And in the following paragraph Leibniz talks of the \" chimerical [cti- tious] supposition of the reality of space in itself \" (26). What all ofthis comes down to is Leibniz 's arguing that space does not exist; thatthere are physical objects which, as we say, are ' in space ', but spacedoes not exist as a distinct further kind of thing which ' contains ' theseobjects. In reading Leibniz 's characterization of Newton 's theory as one of an \" absolute \" space, and his own as one of a \" relative \" space, onemust recall that these ter ms did not mean quite the same to seven-teenth-century writers as they have come to mean in the period sinceEinstein proposed his theories of the relativity of space. WhenEinstein wrote, early in the twentieth century, that space is \" relative \",he was advancing a thesis which clearly presupposed the neo-Leib-nizian concept of space, but which advanced - at the same time -claims about the universe, and in particular about mass, energy,gravity, and the transmission of light, which were never dreamed ofby Leibniz. It is no part of my concer n here to review Einstein 's theo-ries. What I am attempting to do is to propose a theory of space andtime which is consistent with moder n physical theory and whichSpace and Time 151 provides a suitable base on which to erect current theories in physics. I will content myself, that is, with arguing against a common, but woe-fully confused concept of space and time, a concept totally inap-propriate for the doing of moder n physics. When Leibniz contrasts his own theory with that of Newton, saying that Newton hypothesizes that space is ' absolute ' and that he, instead,hypothesizes that space is ' relative ', we must understand that Leibnizis not saying that each of them is arguing that space is a kind of stuffand that they are arguing about whether it is one sort of stuff oranother. Quite the contrary, in his saying that Newton subscribes to atheory of absolute space, Leibniz is arguing that Newton believes thatspace is a kind of stuff. In contrast, when he himself argues that spaceis relative, Leibniz is arguing that space is nonexistent, in his ownwords, that the reality of space is \" chimerical \". In the Newtonian world-view, space and its contents are two differ- ent sorts of things; each exists. And although physical things could not exist except by being (at some determinate point or other) in space,space could exist even if it were devoid (empty) of all physical thingswhatsoever. This view, as I have said, is more or less the commonlyheld view of space. Leibniz 's view is far more economical, but distinctly at variance with common, popular views. In Leibniz 's view, physical objects donot ' inhabit ' space. Physical objects exist; some touch one another;others are separated by various distances from one another; but thereis no further kind of ' stuff ' (space) lling up the places where thereare no physical objects. There is, of course, one immediate benet from adopting the neo- Leibnizian theory: it solves Buber 's problem at a stroke. If space doesnot exist, then it neither has nor lacks an edge. If space does not exist,then there is no place which lies ' within ' space and some other point 3which lies ' without '. Many persons nd this particular manner of solving philosophical puzzles deeply disturbing and nd themselves resisting the proposal. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. Note too that Lucretius 's imagined spear thrower stationed at (in his words) \" the last limits \" (see above p. 9) simply could not exist, and he couldnot exist for the same sorts of reasons that a person who factored the largestodd number could not exist. Just as there is no largest odd number and hencethere could not be anyone who factored it, there is no space and hence therecould not be anyone who stood at its \" last limits \".152 Beyond Experience T them it seems something of a cheat to attempt to solve a puzzle byo undercutting its presuppositions. Thus, for example, some personshave balked at Russell 's solution to the famous Barber paradox. Rus-sell described a male, adult barber, who himself had whiskers, whoshaved all and only those persons in his village who did not shave themselves ([179], 261). The question arises: Who shaves the barber?Whether one answers that he is unshaved, that he shaves himself, orthat someone else shaves him, the answer immediately contradicts oneof the explicit claims made in the description of the barber. Russell 'ssolution - and indeed the only solution possible to the puzzle - is torecognize that the very description given of the barber is internally in-coherent, i.e. it is logically impossible that there should be such a bar-ber. The puzzle can be solved, in effect, only by ' backing up ', as itwere, and challenging one of the presuppositions of the very problemitself. One ' solves ' such a problem, not by answering it, but by reject- ing the problem, by showing that it harbors an untenable presupposi- 4tion. Buber could not solve his problem. That either answer led immedi- ately, in Buber 's own words, to \" absurdity \" is evidence not of theprofundity of the problem itself, not of the need for ingenious solu-tions, but of something fundamentally incoherent in the very problemitself. And what that incoherence consisted in, I suggest, is the popu-larly held, but ultimately untenable, view that space is a kind of ' stuff 'of which it is appropriate to imagine that it has a boundary and ofwhich it is appropriate to ask what lies within it and what lies outsideit. This ' absolute ' (or ' container ') notion of space cannot be freed ofincoherence. There is an altogether different sort of argument which may also be brought to bear against the concept of space as being a kind of ' stuff ',an argument from English grammar. Consider the two English sen-tences, (S1) There is water between the chair and the wall.and(S2) There is space between the chair and the wall.From a point of view of English grammar, these two sentences are identical. From a grammatical point of view, they match word for \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. F r more on the Barber paradox, see [163] and [34], 117-18.oSpace and Time 153 word, phrase for phrase. But in spite of that, there is something pro- foundly different about these two sentences. The concepts water and space which occur in them behave unexpectedly differently from a logical point of view. The remarkable dissimilarity is revealed when we try to paraphrase these two sentences. F r the latter can be given a o paraphrase which is anything but possible for the for mer. (S2) may beparaphrased this way: (S2 ) There is nothing between the chair and the wall, and the chair is not touching the wall. In this paraphrase, only two sorts of ' things ' (or stuff ) are referred to: the chair and the wall. T lk of space has dropped out altogether. No a such paraphrase is possible for (S1). F r in (S1), there really are three o sorts of things involved: chairs, water, and walls. But space is not asort of thing, and this is revealed by the remarkable paraphrase pos-sible for (S2). Two points need to be made about this maneuver. First, and foremost, is the need to address the objection that the paraphrase does not genuinely eliminate talk of space as a kind ofstuff, it merely substitutes a synonym, viz. \" nothing \", in its place. F r o some persons, in reflecting on the paraphrase (S2 ), will believe that they detect in it a reference to three kinds of things: chairs, walls, andnothingness. Indeed, some persons quite explicitly regard \" emptyspace \" and \" nothingness \" as (near-)synonyms. W have, it seems, offered a solution to one philosophical problem,e only to have it replaced by another. Is \" nothing \", when used in a sen-tence such as \" There is nothing between the chair and the wall \", to beregarded as referring to a thing in the way in which \" the chair \" and\" the wall \" refer to things? What role does \" nothing \" play in such asentence? The debate over the question what, if anything, \" nothing \" denotes 5has a long and checkered history in philosophy. Philosophers are splitinto two camps: those that regard \" nothing \" as denoting something(viz. the nothingness) and those that regard \" nothing \" as playing anon-denoting role in our sentences. Lewis Carroll (1832-98), the author of Through the Looking-Glass (who was by profession a mathematician and by avocation a philoso- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5. P.L. Heath 's article, \" Nothing \", in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy ([67], vol. 5, 524-5), exhibits two virtues: it is infor mative and, at the same time, itis one of the few intentionally humorous writings in moder n philosophy.154 Beyond Experience pher), spoofs the view which would make of \" nothing \" (and \" no- 6body \") the name of something (or someone). \" Who did you pass on the road? \" the King went on, holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more hay. \" Nobody, \" said the Messenger.\" Quite right, \" said the King: \" this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you. \" \" I do my best, \" the Messenger said in a sullen tone. \" I 'm sure nobody walks much faster than I do! \" \" He can 't do that, \" said the King, \" or else he 'd have been here rst. \" ([46], 196) Many twentieth-century philosophers, especially those among the Continental schools and the Existential schools, have written of Noth-ingness, treating it - as the King regards \" Nobody \" in Carroll 's fable- as referring to some actually existent thing. They have talked of thefear of Nothingness and of the anxiety caused by the prospects ofNothingness. Some of these philosophers identify Nothingness withdeath; and others with ' the void '. But other philosophers will have nothing (!) of that kind of theoriz- ing. These latter philosophers (myself among them) regard \" nothing \"as playing a different kind of role in our sentences. \" Nothing \", accord-ing to this theory, is just one among several so-called quantiers,words which, in effect, serve to indicate the size of the classes one istalking about. Thus, for example, we might say, \" Everything troublesme today \", or \" Practically everything is troubling me today \", or\" Something is troubling me today \", or - nally - \" There is nothingtroubling me today \". What this latter sentence says, I would urge, isthat there is not anything that is troubling me, i.e. that I am free oftroubles. \" There is nothing troubling me today \" ought not, I suggest,be thought to be saying that I am being troubled and what is doing that 7troubling is Nothing. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. It comes as no surprise that the same person, P.L. Heath, has written both the articles \" Lewis Carroll \" and \" Nothing \" in the Encyclopedia of Philoso- phy ([67]). 7. Strawson has written of the tendency of certain descriptive phrases, e.g. \" the round table \", ' to grow capital letters ' and become converted into names,e.g. \" the Round T ble \". One might notice that there is a tendency, too, in the aSpace and Time 155 Along perfectly similar lines, when we offer a paraphrase of \" There is space between the chair and the wall \" which reads \" There is noth-ing between the chair and the wall and the chair is not touching thewall \", the latter ought to be understood as saying \" There is no (third) thing between the chair and the wall \" rather than as saying \" There is some third thing between the chair and the wall, namely, Nothing. \" If\" Nothing \" named a kind of thing in the world, then - by parallelreasoning, it seems to me - so too would \" something \", \" practicallyeverything \", \" hardly anything \", \" most \", and \" a few \", etc. None ofthese, I suggest, names anything in the world. No more so than does\" it \" in \" It is raining \" or \" there \" in \" There is a car in the driveway. \" If one identies space with The Nothing, then one immediately invites back Buber 's conundrum, only it now reads: \" Where does theNothingness leave off, and what is on the other side? \" The second concer n arising over the maneuver of ' paraphrasing- away ', as it were, the reference to space as a kind of thing does not somuch question the results of applying that technique, but challengesthe very technique itself. Some persons are deeply suspicious andtroubled over the technique of solving philosophical problems bygrammatical or linguistic means. Even cheerfully admitting the cor-rectness of the paraphrase, some persons will resist seeing it as a gen-uine solution to the original problem. The objection they make is tothe alleged relevance of the paraphrase to solving the problem. Again, just as in the case of Russell 's proposed solution of the Bar- ber paradox, persons will have differing attitudes about the philosoph-ical methodology involved. P rsons come to philosophy with different e expectations. What one person sees as a perfectly cogent solution to a \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 writings of certain philosophers for quantiers similarly ' to grow capital let- ters '. If we are not careful to resist the temptation, we may nd the innocent,familiar \" nothing \" mysteriously transmogrifying into a name for the(dreaded) Nothing. Arguments which adopt this latter sort of linguistic fraudfall among what have come to be called ' fallacies of reication '. As a sidelight, I might mention that Strawson 's clever phrase occurs in a reply (1950), \" On Referring \" ([199]), which was directed against BertrandRussell 's \" On Denoting \" ([177]) written some forty-ve years earlier, in1905. As a matter of fact, at the time Russell wrote \" On Denoting \", Straw-son 's birth lay fourteen years in the future. Russell 's eventual reply to Straw-son was published in 1957 ([181]). There must be few other instances in thehistory of thought where an author may be found to be defending one of his /her writings fty-two years after having penned it.156 Beyond Experience problem, another person may fail to regard as even being relevant. F r o some persons, the demonstration that \" space \" has a quite different' logical grammar ' from ordinary substantive ter ms, such as \" water \",\" wall \", and \" chair \", does nothing to address the problem of sortingout the concept of space. Linguistic maneuvers, of the sort we have just gone through paraphrasing away \" space \" in (S2), are regarded asmere ' word-chopping ' or ' hairsplitting ', but not as grappling with thedeep conceptual problems afoot. Other persons, in being presented with precisely the same paraphrase and the accompanying discussion of how \" space \" and\" nothing \" do not behave grammatically like (incontrovertible) sub-stantive ter ms such as \" water \", \" wall \", and the like, experience some-thing of a ' Eureka '-flash, and come to regard problems like Buber 's ashaving their source in thinking of space as if it were an (ethereal) kindof thing. In my own classroom, I often see the different attitudes per-sons have toward these methods. On encountering the method ofparaphrase and the claim that it can sometimes reveal important dis-tinctions among our concepts, some of my students will embrace itwith zeal and regard it as revelatory while others of them will reject itwith open contempt. Who is right? How does one adjudicate when fundamental concep- tions about the very practice itself of philosophy are at stake? Howdoes one argue in support of, or against, the method of paraphrasingas a means of solving some philosophical problems? Certainly greatnumbers of moder n philosophers use such techniques: if not everyday, then at least on some occasions. One can hardly pick up a currentphilosophical journal without nding within it some article in whichthe writer has utilized it or a kindred technique. But for the person un-familiar with, or unused to, such techniques, to whom such techniquesseem linguistic sleights of hand, who initially regards them as beingsome sort of cheat, how is one to recommend and justify the adoptionof such a technique? There can, of course, be no denitive answer. There can be no answer which is ultimately assured of winning converts to a methodol-ogy which some persons view with suspicion or disfavor. It is no morepossible to nd a way to convince one 's opponents of the rightness orutility of a philosophical methodology than it is to nd a way to con-vince one 's opponents of the prot of looking at the world through theeyes of a new scientic theory or adopting a new technology. In spiteof the commonly held view that there is some one canonical ' scienticmethod ', its existence is, when all is said and done, mythical. Simi-Space and Time 157 larly, there is nothing that can be called ' the ' philosophical method, either. Philosophers are bound to disagree among themselves aboutphilosophical methods, just as scientists are bound to disagree overscientic methods. There is no argument in support of the method of paraphrasing which will be convincing to all doubters. One can do no more thanapply that method to various cases, display the results, and inviteone 's readers to decide for themselves whether they regard the methodand its results as acceptable. My own attitude has been to adopt themethod as one tool among several to be used in struggling to explicateour concepts. I am happy to utilize it in the present case because itsresults cohere with the results of other approaches and because itsresults offer a solution to Buber 's problem and because the methodoffers a concept of space suitable for erecting moder n physical theo-ries. This is not to say that I believe that the method of paraphrase isthe touchstone for doing philosophy. Quite the contrary, I believe thatin some instances it has been used in a jawbone fashion, for examplein the analysis of the concept of causation where it has been applied - in the hands of some philosophers - to too few examples, and thusbeen used to advance an overly restricted explication of \" cause \". Inshort, I do not rest my case, of arguing that space is nonexistent,simply on the basis of a paraphrase of (S2). I build the argument onthat paraphrase, to be sure, but on much else besides, e.g. that such anexplication solves Buber 's problem and that such an explicationcoheres with moder n physical theories whereas a ' container ' notion ofspace does not. 8.3 Objections and replies to the neo-Leibnizian theoryIt has been my own experience that most persons relish a lavish ontology*. By this I mean that most persons prefer a conceptualscheme in which there gure a great number of kinds of things. The ter m \" things \" here is meant in a very broad, inclusive sense. On thisinterpretation, \" things \" will include, of course, the most familiarthings of all, namely physical objects, but will include as well all sortsof nonphysical things, e.g. minds (if indeed they are nonphysical),supernatural beings, numbers, classes, colors, pains, mathematicaltheorems, places, and events. In short, \" things \" is being used here as ageneral name for any sort of thing (!) whatsoever that can be named ordescribed. Most persons, it seems to me, are willing to prune their ontologies158 Beyond Experience only with reluctance. Few persons cheerfully or readily are willing to discard items from their stock-in-trade ontology. Every philosopherwho has ever argued that some item or other in the popularly heldontology is expendable insofar as it is mythical or incoherent has, I amsure, met with resistance from persons arguing that the suggestion is apatent offense against common sense. There is much to be said for the commonsense view of the world. F remost is the fact that it works extremely well. One tampers with ito only gingerly and always at some risk of damaging it. But common-sensical views of the world are not perfect and are not immune tochange and improvement. One can sometimes improve on commonsense, but one must take care in trying to do so. F r a good deal of o suggested repair - e.g. that disease is a myth - is downright danger-ous. The neo-Leibnizian theory I have described above, the theory that space does not exist, i.e. that there is no such thing as space, isguaranteed to elicit from many persons the objection that it does somuch violence to common sense that it is simply fantastic. The con-cept of space as being a kind of thing is so pervasive in our common-sense view of the world that any suggestion that space does not reallyexist is regarded as a philosopher 's fancy not to be seriously credited. Let me try, somewhat further, to undo this sort of resistance. Let me try both to show how the theory works, and how it succeeds inpreserving what is valuable in common sense and how it discardswhat is problematic in the commonsensical view. Objection 1: Lord Kelvin once extolled the virtues of measurement this way: \" ... when you can measure what you are speaking about andexpress it in numbers you know something about it; but when youcannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, yourknowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind \" ([109] 80). Prob-ably he overstated the negative side of the case. There are doubtlessall sorts of things - such as beauty in music and nobility of character -which have not succumbed to precise measurement but about which 8our knowledge cannot, reasonably, be judged to be ' unsatisfactory '.On the positive side, however, Kelvin 's point is well taken. Measure-ment, especially if it is reproducible, public, accurate, and utilizable in \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8. Abraham Kaplan 's views on measurement are even stronger than Kel- vin 's: \"No problem is a purely qualitative one in its own nature; we maySpace and Time 159 a well-established scientic theory, does provide us with valuable 9knowledge. More particularly, it provides us with knowledge of real features of the world. If something is measurable, then it exists. Non-existent things cannot be measured. Now space surely can be meas-ured. W need not, for example, content ourselves merely with notinge that there is some space between the chair and the wall, we canproceed to measure quantitatively that amount of space. Using a steel tape measure, we may nd that the shortest distance between the twois 55.6 cm. Using more rened laboratory instruments, we canmeasure space with an accuracy of better than one part in ten million.Surely it must be a mistake, then, given the acknowledged possibilityof perfor ming such public, reproducible, and accurate measurements,to argue that space itself is a ction. Reply to Objection 1: The theory of space being proposed here must not be thought to deny the possibility of our perfor ming suchmeasurements. Any theory which said that it is impossible to measurethe distance between chairs and walls would be at such gross variancewith simple physical facts as to be worthy of rejection immediately.The neo-Leibnizian theory, obviously, cannot deny such ' hard facts ' ifit is to be seriously entertained. And indeed it does not. Quite the con-trary, Leibniz implicitly allows that such measurements are possible([5], Fifth paper, \u00a754, 75). Certainly it is possible to measure the distances between many physical objects. F r ordinary-sized physical things, close at hand, we o can use calipers and meter sticks; for greater distances, surveyors 'transit theodolites; and for still greater distances, radar, parallax meas-urements, and Doppler red-shift measurements. All of this simplymust be admitted, and indeed all of it is left perfectly intact in theneo-Leibnizian theory. Even more to the point, this theory makes the picture of physical objects standing in various spatial relationships to one another its fun- damental notion. According to the neo-Leibnizian theory, it is precise- ly physical objects and their spatial relationships which are real. What \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 always approach it in quantitative ter ms. W may; but can we always do so? e Are there not some things which are intrinsically unmeasurable ... ? F r my o part, I answer these questions with an unequivocal ' No ' \" ([108], 176). 9. See also Cassirer: \" A fact is understood when it is measured \" ([47], 140).160 Beyond Experience is denied to be real is some sort of pervasive ' stuff ' (i.e. space) of which these relations are somehow to be thought of as properties. In this neo-Leibnizian theory, from the point of view of physics , what exists are physical bodies, persisting through time, some verysmall (including the molecules of the gaseous mixture air), othersimmense, some touching one another, others at various distances,some at relative rest, i.e. not moving with respect to some object con-ventionally chosen as the ' xed point ', and yet others in motion withrespect to that ' xed point '. But that 's it. There is no further etherealsoup (space) in which all these objects ' float ', as it were, like sh inthe sea. But if there is no ethereal ' stuff ' between objects, thenBuber 's peculiar views of the world cannot arise . What we have in this theory is what is worth preserving, viz. physical objects of varioussizes moving about with respect to one another. What falls away isprecisely, and only, that part of the picture which was problematic: theidea that space was a further kind of ' thing ' of which it was appropri-ate to imagine that it, too, had an ' inside ' and an ' outside '. Objection 2: It is not simply that we are able to measure the distance between non-contiguous objects. It goes well beyond that. Physicists,astronomers, cosmologists, and geometers attribute geometrical prop- erties to space, e.g. they are wont to talk of space being \" curved \" andof space having \" three dimensions \". Surely only an existent thing can have such physical properties. If there is curvature, then there mustexist something to be curved; if there are three dimensions, then there must exist something to be three-dimensional. Reply to Objection 2: The denition of \" curvature \", as a mathemati- cally calculable measure, was invented by Gauss (1777-1855) in two 10papers of 1825 and 1827 on the geometry of two-dimensional sur-faces ([76], 15, 97). The Gaussian measure of the curvature at any \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. With the advent, c. 1975, of fractal geometry (launched by Benoit Man- delbrot; see [131], chap. X I I, for a history) and its talk of ' fractal dimensions ', it is becoming common among mathematicians to replace this historical,unqualied use of \" dimension \" with \" topological* dimension \". But sincethere is no discussion in this book of fractal geometry, I have felt no par-ticular need to adopt the refor med terminology. When I speak of spatialdimensions, I will be referring to the historically familiar dimensions ofwidth, height, and depth.Space and Time 161 point is the reciprocal* of the products of the greatest and least radii of curvature at that point. F r example, consider the curvature at a point o on the ' equator ' of a perfect sphere. The surface curves equally in alldirections, e.g. along the equator itself and along the line of longitudethrough that point; i.e. both these circles have the same radius. Let uscall that radius \" R \". The measure of the curvature, then, according to the Gaussian formula would be 1 / ( R \u00d7 R). Note that it makes no mat- ter whether \" R \" is regarded as positive or negative: in being multi- plied by itself, the result must be positive. Thus, for a (perfect) sphere,the measure of curvature is at every point the same and is always posi-tive. Imagine now the sphere growing to innite size: the surface is (ef- fectively) flat, and the radius is innite (i.e. ). The Gaussian formula tells us that the curvature is 1 / ( \u00d7 ), i.e. zero. That is, a plane sur- face, a flat two-dimensional ' space ', has a curvature of zero. Thirdly, imagine a doughnut-shaped surface, or as mathematicians call it, a torus (pl. tori). Imagine it to be oriented as if lying on atabletop. (See gure 8.1, p. 162) Choose a point on the inner surface,i.e. on the perimeter of the hole in the middle. (In gure 8.1, see theleft-hand side of the lower diagram.) There are two circles here, atright angles: a horizontal circle (whose radius is labeled \" R \") com- prising that inner perimeter; and a vertical circle (whose radius islabeled \" r \"), that of the cross-section through the dough of the pastry. (If you prefer, imagine two interlocked key rings, touching at rightangles.) What makes this case importantly different from the preced-ing two is that the two radii of curvature are in opposite directions. If one is assigned a positive value, the other must be assigned a negativevalue. Assume one is + r and the other is - R. Then the Gaussian for- mula gives a negative value for the curvature, i.e. 1 / (- R \u00d7 +r), which is, of course, equal to -1 / ( | R | \u00d7 | r | ). Such negatively curved surfaces are exhibited along the inner surfaces of tori, on saddles, and on thebells (flares) of hunting hor ns, trumpets, etc. (Incidentally, you mightnotice that the curvature of the surface of tori changes from place toplace. While the curvature is negative on the perimeter of the hole, itis positive on the points farthest from the hole [see the right-hand halfof the diagram in gure 8.1]. There the two radii, R and r, point in the 11same direction, and hence the curvature is positive. ) As Gauss originally introduced the concept, to apply to features of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 11. F r more on the concept of curvature, see [3], esp. 261-86 and 356-70.o162 Beyond Experience Figure 8.1 two-dimensional surfaces, curvature is readily grasped. But it was not long before the concept was extended in 1854, by Riemann (1826-66),to apply, not to two-dimensional surfaces, but to three-dimensionalspace ([173]). F r a mathematician, a ' space ' may be of any number of dimen-o sions. Indeed, a ' space ' need not refer to anything physical whatever:it is just a measure of the number of ' dimensions ' needed to specifythe ' location ' of something of interest. F r example, Helmholtz cites o the case of the three-dimensional ' space ' of colors: any given colormay be located in the (nite) three-dimensional space of red, green,and blue, by specifying for each of these ' dimensions ' (primarycolors) what percentage occurs in the given color. (He omits intensity;had he included that parameter, he would have needed a four-dimen-Space and Time 163 sional ' space ' which was nite in three of its dimensions, and innite in the fourth.) If someone offered a theory of intelligence, for ex-ample, in which there were ve independent parameters to be meas-ured - e.g. verbal skills, mathematical skills, physical skills, creativeskills, and social skills - then one would have to posit a ' space ' ofthese ve dimensions in which to locate any given person. From themathematical point of view, there is utterly no difference between the' spaces ' of geometry, of color spectra, and of intelligence. All ofthese, and countless other ' manifolds ', are called \" spaces \". Even phi-losophers have adopted the concept and sometimes talk (perhaps a bitpretentiously) of such esoterica as \" logical \" space. When Riemann extended Gauss 's original concept of the curvature of two-dimensional surfaces to a three-dimensional space, we mustunderstand that he was proceeding by mathematical analogy. He was, in effect, arguing that certain features of three-dimensional geometry(and by extension, four-, ve-, six-, indeed any n-dimensional geome- try) would be extensions of features of two-dimensional geometry. Inany analogy, certain features are preserved and others discarded. Andin extending Gauss 's original notion, devised for two-dimensionalgeometry, to three-, four-, or higher-dimensional geometries, we musttake care to understand exactly what may be carried over and what isto be discarded. Riemann discovered that in a ' positively curved ' space, many of the familiar theorems of Euclidean geometry do not hold. F r example, in o such a space, there are no parallel lines and the sum of the angles oftriangles always exceeds 180 \u00b0. But what, exactly, is one to make of this notion of a ' positively curved ' space? The intellectual puzzlearises because of the difculty we have in trying to extend the familiarnotions of curvature which were introduced, in the rst instance, toapply to two-dimensional surfaces: of the sphere, of the torus, etc. Tobe sure, the sphere and the torus are three-dimensional objects; buttheir surfaces are two-dimensional ' spaces '. W can intuitively grasp e the sense of \" curvature \" operative in these familiar cases because wecan visualize that the curved surfaces are the two-dimensional sur-faces of a three-dimensional gure. But when we are then told that ourown physical space is (or might be) curved, and we try by analogy tovisualize it as being the surface of some four-dimensional solid, ourimaginations fail us. The analogy becomes more hindrance than help. Mathematicians are practiced enough to know how to handle the analogy correctly. Mathematicians, that is, know how to abstract theessential mathematical features from such examples - the plane, the164 Beyond Experience sphere, the torus, etc. Non-mathematicians, however, are done a dis- service by these models, for they are not practiced in focusing in onjust the relevant mathematical features at play, and are far too likely,virtually inevitably likely, to be distracted by the robust reality of thephysical objects (the Earth, the hunting hor n) which ' sport ' thesecurved surfaces. What the mathematician wants to focus on in thesemodels are the surfaces themselves, divorced from the things of whichthey happen to be the surfaces, i.e. the mathematician is concer nedsolely with the mathematical, not the physical, properties of these sur-faces. But all of this is usually lost in most popular presentations ofmoder n geometry. Already in the nineteenth century, Hermann Helmholtz recognized non-mathematicians ' inability to handle the concept of curvature in the manner of physicists and mathematicians, i.e. he recognized thatnon-mathematicians tried to conceive of the curvature which was saidto characterize physical space after the model of curvature which wasfamiliar in the case of the two-dimensional surfaces of three-dimen-sional objects. Helmholtz advises that one abandon any attempt toconceive of curvature in that manner. Instead we should conceive of curvature as the result of a certain kind of calculation we perfor m on quantities we measure with our instruments. All known space-relations are measurable, that is, they may be brought to determination of magnitudes (lines, angles, surfaces,volumes). Problems in geometry can therefore be solved, bynding methods of calculation for arriving at unknown mag-nitudes from known ones. ... Now we may start with this view of space, according to which the position of a point may be determined by measure-ments in relation to any given gure (system of co-ordinates),taken as xed, and then inquire what are the special characteris-tics [e.g. the curvature] of our space as manifested in themeasurements that have to be made. This path was rst enteredby ... Riemann of G \u00a8 ttingen. It has the peculiar advantage that o all its operations consist in pure calculation of quantities whichquite obviates the danger of habitual perceptions being takenfor necessities of thought. ... T prevent misunderstanding, I will once more observe thato this so-called measure of space-curvature is a quantity obtainedby purely analytical [mathematical] calculation, and that itsintroduction involves no suggestion of relations that wouldSpace and Time 165 have a meaning only for sense-perception. ([89], 44-7) Helmholtz, like Riemann himself, regards this ' new talk ' of curvature, not as describing perceivable, or even imaginable, properties of space,but rather as a result to be obtained by mathematical calculation onmeasured quantities. In moder n science, too, many writers repeat the advice, cautioning readers explicitly about the potentially misleading use of the word\" curved \". The astronomer Dennis Sciama, for example, writes that itis misleading to talk of non-Euclidean space as \" curved \". But hispoint is perfectly general, and does not apply only to non-Euclideanspace, for it is, in a way, just as misleading to describe Euclideanspace as \" flat \". I will bracket certain phrases in quoting him, so as tomake his point more general. In this instance, bracketing indicates notmy insertions, but rather my suggested deletions from the original:\" W can easily understand what it means to say that a two-dimen-e sional surface is curved, because we can see this surface lying inthree-dimensional [Euclidean] space, and the meaning of the word' curvature ' is quite obvious. But when this same name ' curvature ' isalso given to a three-dimensional [non-Euclidean] space (footnote: letalone four-dimensional space-time!) it becomes rather misleading. ...All that is meant by the curvature of space, then, is that gravitationaffects the motion of bodies \" ([186], 146). The essential point isSciama 's last sentence: \" All that is meant by the curvature of space,then, is that gravitation affects the motion of bodies. \" And he might 12have added, \" and affects the path of light rays. \" (A minor matter: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12. The mathematician-astronomer I.W. Roxburgh makes much the same point, but writes at somewhat greater length: \" ... what is this stuff calledspace whose curvature is to be determined - how do we measure it? W can, e like Gauss, set up a triangulation experiment and measure the angles of a tri-angle - the answer will not be 180 \u00b0 - but this does not mean space is curved. The experiment is done with light rays and theodolites - the empirical resultis a statement about the behaviour of light rays - not about space. It is, as itmust be, an experiment about the relationship between objects in space notabout space itself. The same is necessarily true about any experiment; from itwe lear n of the relationship between objects not of the background we callspace. ... Space ... is an intermediary that we bring into the formalism [ofrelativity theory] for ease of representation, but in any empirical statement about the world the representation [i.e. space itself] is eliminated \" ([175], 87; italics added).166 Beyond Experience The so-called curvature of space varies from place to place. The cur- vature is more marked, i.e. light rays are more affected, in the vicinityof massive bodies than at places remote from them. And the overallcurvature of the entire universe is a function of both the amount andthe distribution of mass within the universe.) T lk of space itself being curved has become commonplace withina physics. But one must beware not to interpret such talk too literally, orat least not with the common meanings we assign to the word \" curva-ture \". W should no more want to regard the physicist 's use of thee ter m \" curvature \" as being akin to the ordinary use than we shouldwant to regard the physicist 's use of the word \" eld \" as being akin tothe far mer 's. In suggesting that we should deliberately and consciously try to resist the temptation to conceive of space as a kind of subtle, tenuous,ethereal, or subliminal kind of ' stuff ', the sort of thing which begs usto try to imagine where its boundaries might be or what its curvatureor geometry might be, I am not suggesting that we refor m our lan-guage so as to purge it of the word \" space \" or that we cease altogether to talk of space. T try to avoid talking of space strikes me as futile o and as foolhardy an enterprise as some have attempted with certainother ter ms. History provides us with the spectacle of a number of lin-guistic cultists who have trained themselves to speak without everuttering words which they regarded as ' corrupt ' - not barbarisms like\" priorize \", \" irregardless \" and \" de-hire \", but perfectly ordinary nuts- 13and-bolts words such as \" but \" or \" not \" and even (incredibly) \" is \".(I have had students, bamboozled by bizarre linguistic theories, try toexplain to me that every time one uses the word \" but \" in describing 14the behavior of another person, one has insulted that person. ) Some proposals to refor m language are grounded in good reasons; some are not. Certain proposals - e.g. to use nonsexist pronouns and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13. F r example, this sort of linguistic nonsense was occasionally peddled ino the 1930s by some of the more extreme of the disciples of Alfred Korzybski,founder of the school of General Semantics. General Semantics must not beconfused with the moder n science of semantics*. Indeed Korzybski himselfwrote, \" My work in General Semantics has nothing to do with the above-mentioned disciplines [pragmatics, semantics, and logic] \" ([113], 282). 14. Counterexamples which refute the theory are easy to nd. It is no insult, but rather a compliment, to say, \" She had missed a day of work because of anairline strike, but still managed to break all sales records for July. \"Space and Time 167 nonsexist descriptive ter ms or to eliminate offensive racist and ethnic labels - have powerful ethical warrant. However, there are nosimilarly good reasons - either on ethical or on any other grounds -for eliminating such words as \" is \", \" but \", and \" space \". These lattersorts of ter ms, or equivalents, are enormously useful, being well-suited for most contexts. It would be pointless and counterproductiveto abstain from using the word \" space \". All of us, myself included,will surely continue to say such perfectly intelligible and correctthings as \" There is not enough space on the shelf for this book \" or\" There is too much space in the garden to conceal with a singlerosebush. \" My suggestion is only that, even though we use the word\" space \" often and with propriety, we not allow ourselves to think thatthe ter m designates some sort of tenuous ' stuff '. When we nd our-selves lapsing into the kinds of speculations which so befuddledBuber, and perhaps ourselves earlier, it is at that point that we shouldremind ourselves that \" space \" does not function in our language like\" water \", that any sentence containing the word \" space \" can be para-phrased so that talk of \" space \" drops out. (\" There 's not enough spaceon the shelf for this book \" might become, for example, \" If all theobjects on the shelf were to be shoved to the left end of the shelf, thenthe distance at the right end, between the last object and the right edgeof the shelf, would be less than the width of this book. \") George Berkeley (1685-1753), perhaps paraphrasing Francis Ba- con, wrote: \"... we ought to ' think with the lear ned and speak with thevulgar [ordinary persons] ' \" ( A Treatise Concer ning the Principles of Human Knowledge , [27], 45-6). Although I certainly do not share the views he was advancing in the context in which the quotation appears(he was arguing against the reality of material objects), the maxim,divorced from that particular application, remains good advice. Theword \" space \" is here to stay. Nonetheless, there is nothing to preventour adopting a rened understanding of the concept invoked by thatword. Although we persist in using the word, we can certainly adoptthe sort of conception counseled by the lear ned: by Leibniz, by Helm-holtz, and by moder n cosmologists. W are free to abandon the inco- e herent notion of space which would make space a kind of ' stuff ', or,even worse, a kind of ' curved stuff '. Objection 3: The idea that space exists derives not just from common sense, or even, for that matter, from physics, but from perception.Space is not a theoretical posit, or hypothetical entity, in the way inwhich the ' collective unconscious ' might be thought to be. Quite the168 Beyond Experience contrary, space is every bit as perceivable as are physical objects. F r o I do not see only physical objects, I can also see the space between them. On clear moonless nights, I can look up at the sky and see the very blackness of space itself. In short, I can see space. Since I can see space, and since I am experiencing neither an illusion nor a delusion,space must, then, exist. Reply to Objection 3: It is perfectly clear what the reply must be to this last objection. Someone holding to a neo-Leibnizian theory ofspace, who thereby wishes to deny the reality of space, must counter-argue that space is not visible. But can one reasonably do this? Is not space visible in just the same sort of way, for example, that my hand isvisible when held up before my eyes in a well-lighted room? Thereare, I think, two different sorts of cases where one might think one isperceiving space itself, and we would do well to examine both ofthem. The rst sort of case involves ordinary, daylight perception, the kind you and I regularly experience as we look about ourselves inwell-lighted places. What do we see? T pically, all sorts of physical y objects - tables, chairs, pictures on the walls, carpets, human beings,etc. (if we are indoors); buildings, trees, roads, flowers, clouds, humanbeings, etc. (if we are outdoors) - lying at different distances from ourvantage point. These many things are scattered about in differentplaces, and often there are few if any other things occupying theplaces between them. About this we can all agree, and up to this pointwe give identical reports. But is there something more to be seen? Isthere, in addition to the sorts of things just mentioned, space as well?Do we see space between the objects? T be sure, we say such things as \" I can see space between the wall o and the chair \" or \" I can see that there is a space between the wall andthe chair. \" But - as before - we must treat such locutions very care-fully. If you could really (or genuinely or authentically) see space, then you ought to be able to answer the question, \" What color is thatspace? \" Immediately, you are brought up short. What color is the space between the chair and the wall? If you try to answer that it iscolorless, then you might rightly be asked how you could possibly seesomething which is colorless. In more familiar cases where we use theter m \" colorless \", we can talk of seeing the colorless item, a liter ofdistilled water for example, because the object refracts light (otherobjects look distorted in various ways when viewed through theSpace and Time 169 object) or because the colorless object exhibits reflections on its sur- face. But space is supposed to be even more colorless than the mostperfectly distilled water. Locally, in our living rooms and on the streetin front of our homes, space does not refract the images of objects andspace does not boast a surface which sports reflections. Space isthought to be non-refractive and non-reflective. If so, then it must beperfectly invisible. What ' seeing space ' amounts to, then, is looking at the places between visible things and failing to see anything there.' Seeing space ' is not the successful seeing of something which exists,but is instead the looking at a place and the failure to see anythingthere. W do not see space; what we see - and describe in a slightly e misleading way - are places devoid of things. This leaves the other case which I mentioned a moment ago. Can 't we see space when we look up at the sky on a moonless night? Can 'twe see the inky blackness of space itself ? \" Space is not colorless afterall; phenomenologically space is black, and can be seen, \" our criticmight object. Often, persons who hold to the theory that space is a kind of thing are not consciously aware that they hold two inconsistent views aboutspace: both that space in our living rooms is colorless and space be-tween galaxies is black. But they cannot have it both ways. And theymust be challenged: \" W ll, which is it, colorless or black, and why the e difference? \" The simple answer is that it is neither. The tension between the con- flicting answers arises out of a misbegotten concept of space. Theplaces between objects, where there are no other objects, are not' things ' of which one can ask, \" Are they colored or colorless? \" Emptyplaces are not things: they are neither colored nor colorless; they arenot black, and they are not any other color either. \" Why, then, is the space between the chair and the table, unlike the space between Mars and V nus, not black? \" This way of putting the e question persists with the confusion. The ' space ' between Mars andV nus is not black. W do not see blackness between the chair and the ee table, not because the space ' there ' is some other color, but becausewe can see, by looking through that place, the illuminated wall be-yond. If space existed and were colored, then I could not see my handwhen held up a few inches from my nose: the intervening space wouldblock my view. The sky is black between Mars and V nus, not be- e cause (interplanetary) ' space ' is black, but rather because there isnothing to be seen there (between the planets) and nothing (except for170 Beyond Experience 15an occasional distant star) to be seen further on, either. When we look up at the sky on a moonless night and get an impres- sion of black, we are not seeing a black ' thing '. W are not seeing e anything at all, and our nervous system fools us, by presenting it toour consciousness as if it were a gigantic piece of coal. Sometimes weget an impression of black from genuinely black physical objects, e.g.lumps of coal and the like. But our nervous system presents (much)the same visual impression when there is nothing there whatsoever.W must take care not to think that if there is a visual impression ofe black, then there is something there which is black. The ancients used to think that the (night) sky was the interior of a hollow black globe and the stars were tiny holes in that globe throughwhich light shone. W should not want to replace that defective notion e with one which would substitute for the black globe an innite, tenu-ous, subtle ' container ', either black or colorless. Physical things exist, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 15. From a phenomenological point of view, i.e. from the point of view of the sensory quality of the experience rather than the physics of its cause, weshould realize that black is a color, on an equal footing with red, blue, yellow,etc. The often-heard slogan \" black is not a color \" is an article of physics, notof the phenomenology of sense perception. Black happens to be the color weperceive within our visual elds in those areas which are negligibly illumi-nated. It is possible, of course, to imagine that such minimally illuminatedareas might have been perceived as red or yellow, or some other color. Thatwe perceive such areas as black just happens to be a product of the way weare wired. It is not surprising, then, that when at rst robbed of illumination, our visual sense offers up to us a visual eld which is black. But, as we know,after a while, the blackness ' fades ' from our consciousness. When seated in adarkened room for several minutes, most of us become oblivious to the blackvisual eld in just the way that we become oblivious to the kinesthetic sensa-tions of our body pressing against our chair. W come gradually not to see e anything: there is no color sensation at all, not even of blackness. What is it like to be bor n blind? Is it to experience an innite, black fea- tureless visual eld? I think not. I sometimes try to imagine blindness bymoving my hand from clear view in front of my face around to the back ofmy head. At no point does my hand enter ' the inky blackness '. It simplydisappears from view. That is what, I imagine, it must be like to be blind: justwhat it is like for me not to be able to see something positioned directlybehind my head. I am, like everybody, blind in that direction. T be com- o pletely blind is to be unseeing, not as we all are in some directions, but to be unseeing in all directions. It is not to perceive an inky blackness.Space and Time 171 and because there are physical things, and only because there are physical things, there are also places. There is no need to posit anantecedently and independently existing physical space, a container,as it were, in which to imbed these physical objects. Neither physicsnor our logic requires such a posit. Indeed, the very idea itself is, ulti-mately, internally incoherent. 8.4 Interlude: The expression \" x does not exist \" Doubtless one of the things which bemuses, indeed even baffles, per- sons new to philosophy is metaphysicians ' proclivity to pronounce ofall sorts of things which non-philosophers regard as relatively familiarthat they are, in the end, nonexistent. Metaphysicians have often beenknown to deny the very existence of such (seemingly) obvious thingsas space, time, minds, material objects, superegos, evil, miracles,causes, physical laws, free will, and objective truth. Sometimes theirnegative pronouncements have the result of inducing great curiosity intheir hearers, but sometimes the effect is entirely opposite to thatintended, inducing, instead, great impatience, even outright alienation.The audience for such claims may nd themselves initially protesting:\" But surely that cannot be right. It is patently obvious that such athing really does exist. \" Such persons may come to regard metaphys-ics as the wholesale rejection of common sense. Generally metaphysicians know very well that in denying the exist- ence of certain things we are bucking common sense. Metaphysiciansare not a species apart. Virtually all of us grow up among the very per-sons to whom we direct our writings and speak (more or less) thesame language as the proverbial ' man in the street '. What explains ourtalk about \" x does not really exist \" is our indulging in a kind of literary license, a minor - but possibly potentially misleading - pieceof professional hyperbole. Usually such locutions are meant as atten-tion-getters, as a means of highlighting dramatically and forcefully thefocus of our concer ns. In most cases (but certainly not quite all), themetaphysician who writes \" x does not exist \" may be found to be advancing a rather more complicated theory, viz. \" x does not exist, if by ' x ' one means ' y '; and while y does not exist, something else, viz. z does; and taking the latter to be what is denoted by ' x ' is a better theory.\" Put less formally, generally what is involved in the metaphys-ician 's denying that x exists is really the offering of an alter native theory, to be substituted in place of the prevailing, and allegedlydefective, theory about the nature of x.172 Beyond Experience In denying, as I have just done in the previous section, that space exists, I did not stop simply with making that denial. What wasinvolved in denying that space exists was the elaboration that whatwas being challenged was a particular concept of space, a conceptwhich would portray space as being itself something like a spatialobject. And it is that particular concept, I argued, which is incoherentand in need of replacement. What was not being challenged, indeedwhat was being insisted upon, is most of what occurs in the ordinaryconcept, e.g. that there are physical objects, that they are strewn aboutthe universe in different places at varying, and indeed measurable, dis-tances, and that physics can tell us a very great deal about howmaterial objects can interact gravitationally and can tell us the geome-try of the path of radiation in the vicinity of massive bodies. In deny-ing that space exists, not only was none of this latter denied, it waspositively insisted upon. The claim that space does not exist is my(and several other philosophers ') way of calling attention to the factthat space conceived after the fashion of a quasi-physical object is an untenable notion. And thus it goes. T pically when metaphysicians deny that some- y thing exists, we do not just leave it at that. What we are in fact doingis offering an alter native theory; we are trying to show that there issomething defective in the ordinary notion and are offering a repair.Only rarely, if ever, do we suggest that a concept should be discardedwithout being replaced by anything at all. In the following section, we will, for the rst and only time in this book, encounter a theory, McT ggart 's theory of time, which is of the a latter sort. McT ggart argued that neither of the two principal theories a of time is tenable, and that time does not exist. Few other metaphysi-cians are disposed to accept his arguments. 8.5 P sitive and negative theories of timeo Just as there are two major theories of space - the ' container ' theory and the relational (or Leibnizian) theory - there are two major theoriesof time. Indeed, I regard it as one of the most important successes ofmoder n metaphysics to have discovered just how much similarity there is, in their formal aspects, between space and time. (W will e devote sections 8.7 through 8.10 to the topic of spatial and temporalanalogies.) There is a certain problem in what we are to call each of these theo- ries. The rst is sometimes called the \" absolute \", \" dynamic \", \" Augus-Space and Time 173 tinian \", or, simply, the \" A-theory \". The latter name, \" A-theory \", does not stand either for \" absolute \" or for \" Augustinian \", but derives fromJ.M.E. McT ggart (1866-1925), who distinguished two sets of tem- a poral ter ms, one he designated the \" A-series \" and the other, the \" B-series \". The second, opposing, theory is sometimes known as the \" relative \", \" static \", or \" B-theory \" of time. In its way, the Augustinian theory of time is the temporal analog of the ' container theory ' of space and, not surprisingly, it prompted inAugustine himself much the same sort of bewilderment that we havealready seen in Buber: \" Time ... is never all present at once. The pastis always driven on by the future, the future always follows on theheels of the past, and both the past and the future have their beginningand their end in the eternal present \" ([15], \u00a711). Hardly are thesewords down on paper than Augustine has second thoughts andretracts, or contradicts, what he has just said about the present being' eternal ': \" Of these three divisions of time ... how can two, the pastand the future, be, when the past no longer is and the future is not yet? As for the present, if it were always present and never moved on tobecome the past, it would not be time but eternity \" (\u00a714). But this isonly the start of his problems. F r now he goes on to write: o If the future and past do exist, I want to know what they are. I may not yet be capable of such knowledge, but at least I knowthat wherever they are, they are not there as future or past, butas present. F r if, wherever they are, they are future, they do o not yet exist; if past, they no longer exist. So wherever they areand whatever they are, it is only by being present that they are. (\u00a718) ... it is abundantly clear that neither the future nor the past exist, and therefore it is not strictly correct to say that there arethree times, past, present, and future. It might be correct to saythat there are three times, a present of past things, a present ofpresent things, and a present of future things. Some such differ-ent times do exist in the mind, but nowhere else that I can see.(\u00a720) What Augustine is nally driven to, we see, is a ' psychological ' theory of time: the past and the future exist (mysteriously) ' in themind ', but not in objective reality. Any such theory must immediatelyface the problem how it is possible to measure time. This would be an174 Beyond Experience especially acute problem in moder n physics where it is commonplace, using exquisitely crafted instruments, to resolve time intervals intomillion-millionths of seconds. Such remarkable precision seems or-ders of magnitude beyond what any of us is capable of by psychologi-cal reckoning. But even in the far cruder physics of the fourth century A D, a psychological theory of time faced a hopeless uphill battle. Augustine 's claim - \" It is in my own mind, then, that I measure time.I must not allow my mind to insist that time is something objective \"(\u00a727) - is a virtual non-starter when it comes to explaining severalpersons ' common measurements of time. Augustine would have usbelieve that memories and expectations are the actual objects of ourtemporal measurements: \" ... it is not future time that is long, but along future is a long expectation of the future; and past time is notlong, because it does not exist, but a long past is a long remembranceof the past \" (\u00a728). Memories of the past and expectations of the futureare no substitute for actual physical measurements of temporal inter-vals as they occur . My memory of my son 's birthday celebration, for example, may last only a fleeting moment, although the celebrationmay have gone on for hours. Presently held memories and expecta-tions simply do not have the temporal extents of the events remem-bered or expected and cannot be used as their proxies in our trying todetermine their durations. How can we summarize the core of Augustine 's theory? Augustine, himself, provides a useful characterization: \" [Time] can only be com-ing from the future, passing through the present, and going into thepast. In other words, it is coming out of what does not yet exist, pass-ing through what has no duration, and moving into what no longerexists \" (\u00a721). Y u can see here why Augustine 's theory has some- o times been called the \" dynamic \" theory. He posits, not things orevents evolving through time, but time itself as moving from thefuture, through the present, to the past. And you can also see why onemight regard such a theory as the temporal analog of the spatial theorywhich regards space as a ' container '. F r just as the absolute theory of o space treats space itself (as we have seen) as a quasi-spatial thing,Augustine 's theory of time treats time itself as a quasi-temporal thing,i.e. as a sort of thing which \" passes \" and \" moves \". And you can see,too, why Augustine 's is sometimes regarded as a ' positive ' theory oftime: because it asserts that there is more to time than just events standing in temporal relations. It may be contrasted with so-called' negative ' theories which assert that there is nothing more to time thanevents standing in temporal relationships.Space and Time 175 Augustine, to be sure, is not wholly happy with his own theory, and seems constantly to be troubling himself with peculiar questions -ones which arise naturally for a positive theory - such as \" While weare measuring it, where is it coming from, what is it passing through,and where is it going? \" (\u00a721). But where Buber was driven to despair,Augustine - cleric that he was - was driven to prayer. Throughout hischapter on time, Augustine beseeches God for divine illumination onthese mysteries. At the beginning of the twentieth century, McT ggart may be found a to be promoting arguments virtually identical to Augustine 's. Butwhere Augustine confessed his bewilderment at the results of his ownresearches and seemed distressed by them, McT ggart unabashedly a concludes that time is, in his words, \" unreal \". It may seem strange that I will take McT ggart to task for this latter a conclusion. After all, have I not just nished a moment ago, in thisvery chapter, a lengthy argument to the effect that space is nonexist-ent? Why should I be sanguine about my own denial that space exists,and then take exception to McT ggart 's claim that time does not exist? a There is an important distinction between the sort of theory about space which I have just advanced and the sort of theory about timewhich McT ggart advances. In denying that space exists, I tried to a explain that what that short proposition was to be understood to beasserting was that there is nothing in Nature like what is described bythe theory of absolute space. I was denying one particular theory ofspace, only to be offering what I take to be a better theory, that of rela-tive space, in its stead. And what makes the foregoing enterprise sodifferent from McT ggart 's theory of time is that McT ggart, in argu- aa ing for the unreality of time, is not offering a theory of relative time to replace or supersede a theory of absolute time, but is arguing againstthe viability of either theory. McT ggart is not saying, \" Time does not a exist, if you mean by ' time ' y \"; he is saying, \" Time does not exist, 16period. \" McT ggart begins by directing attention to two different ways wea \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16. A certain qualication is in order. In the latter half of The Nature of Existence ([130]), McT ggart makes a concerted effort to explain how, if a time does not exist, then there is at least the appearance of time. So while it is strictly correct to say that McT ggart argues that time does not exist, he at a least tries to preserve something of our ordinary account, viz., if not the actu-ality, then at least the appearance, of temporality.176 Beyond Experience commonly refer to positions in time. Right at the outset, he qualies his introduction to this topic by writing \" as time appears to us prima facie \". He can hardly begin by saying that time is one way or another, for he is setting out to prove that time does not exist. Hence he talks ofthe \" appearance \" of time, so as not to admit that time does in factexist: \"P sitions in time, as time appears to us prima facie , are distin- o guished in two ways. Each position is Earlier than some and Laterthan some of the other positions. ... In the second place, each position 17is either P st, Present, or Future. The distinctions of the for mer class a are permanent, while those of the latter are not. If M [some event] is ever earlier than N [some other event], it is always earlier. But an event, which is now present, was future, and will be past\" ([130],\u00a7305). The latter of these series, McT ggart calls the \" A-series \", the a for mer, the \" B-series \": \" F r the sake of brevity I shall give the name o of the A series to that series of positions which runs from the far past through the near past to the present, and then from the present throughthe near future to the far future, or conversely. The series of positionswhich runs from earlier to later, or conversely, I shall call the B series \" ([130], \u00a7306). McT ggart then proceeds to argue that it is the A-series which is a metaphysically more fundamental, for it is the A-series alone which can account for change, not the B-series. The B-series is, in a certain sense, static: it cannot account for an event 's changing from having been future, to becoming present, and, nally, becoming past. T ke any event - the death of Queen Anne, for example - anda consider what changes can take place in its characteristics. Thatit is a death, that it is the death of Anne Stuart, that it has suchcauses, that it has such effects - every characteristic of this sort \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 17. Later, in a footnote to \u00a7329, McT ggart qualies these statements a bit. a On the supposition that there is a rst moment of time, then there is nomoment Earlier than that moment and there is nothing P st to that moment. a Similarly, if there is a last moment of time, there is nothing Later than thatmoment, nor is there anything Future to that moment. So when he writes thateach \" position is Earlier than ... some other position \", etc., he wants to be understood as making this claim for all positions in time except for the rstand last moments, if such exist at all. This minor correction is inessential forhis ensuing arguments.Space and Time 177 never changes. ... At the last moment of time - if time has a last moment - it will still be the death of a Queen. And in everyrespect but one, it is equally devoid of change. But in onerespect it does change. It was once an event in the far future. Itbecame every moment an event in the nearer future. At last itwas present. Then it became past, and will always remain past,though every moment it becomes further and further past. Such characteristics as these are the only characteristics which can change. And, therefore, if there is any change, itmust be looked for in the A series, and in the A series alone. If there is no real A series, there is no real change. The B series, therefore, is not by itself sufcient to constitute time, since timeinvolves change. ([130], \u00a7311) Notice how McT ggart 's account of time is reminiscent of Augus- a tine 's: the future ' changes ' into the present, and the present ' changes 'into the past. Once an event is past, then it ' recedes ' further and fur-ther from the present. According to this account, it is time itsel f , or positions in time, which undergo change. V rious critics have strenuously objected to this account, since ita seems to temporalize time itself. Time itself seems to be movingthrough time: the future ' becomes ' the present, and the present ' be-comes ' the past. The picture seems to presuppose a kind of super-time, against which the flow of ' ordinary ' time might be measured.Needless to say, many philosophers have attempted to create theoriesof time in which such an awkward, and probably unintelligible, notionis not introduced at all. In chapter 11, we will examine a totally differ-ent sort of theory, one in which time itself does not change, but it isobjects, or things, which change in time. (McT ggart, in \u00a7315, explic- a itly rejects this alter native theory.) But this is to get ahead of our-selves. F r the moment, we must see what McT ggart concludes fromoa his argument that the A-series is metaphysically more fundamental than the B-series. He continues by arguing that time itself can exist only if there is something in reality which has the properties of the A-series. That is, he argues that time is real only if there are events which are future,become present, and recede into the past. But there can be no suchevents. F r nothing whatever can have these properties since they are,o as he attempts to show, logically inconsistent with one another, and noreal (existent) thing can have logically inconsistent properties. Just asa ve-sided square would have logically inconsistent properties and178 Beyond Experience hence could not possibly exist, McT ggart tries to demonstrate that a a time which was future, became present, and receded into the pastwould have logically inconsistent properties and hence could not pos-sibly exist: P st, present and future are incompatible determinations. Everya event must be one or the other, but no event can be more thanone. ... But every event [except the rst and the last, if thereare rst and last events] has them all. If M is past, it has been present and future. If it is future, it will be present and past.Thus all three characteristics belong to each event. ([130],\u00a7329) In short, every event has incompatible determinations: it is past, present, and future. The case is analogous to a gure having exactlyfour and having exactly ve sides. The characteristics are incom-patible, and no such gure could possibly exist. McT ggart anticipates the obvious objection that he has neglecteda the tenses of the various verbs. It may seem that this [claim that there is an incompatibility of determinations] can easily be explained [i.e. exposed to be anerror]. Indeed, it has been impossible to state the difcultywithout almost giving the explanation, since our language hasverb-for ms for the past, present and future, but no for m that iscommon to all three. It is never true, the answer will run, that M is present, past and future. It is present, will be past, and has been future. Or it is past, and has been future and present, or again is future, and will be present and past. The characteristics are only incompatible when they are simultaneous, and there isno contradiction to this in the fact that each ter m has all of themsuccessively. ([130], \u00a7330) But McT ggart has raised this objection only, in tur n, to dispute it.a His ensuing counterobjection, i.e. his defense of his theory, lies in hisasserting that every moment of time \" is both past, present, and future \"([130], \u00a7331). As I reconstruct his rebuttal (\u00a7331), it seems to me tobe something of the following sort. Consider the present moment: it isof course present; but equally, if we were to pick a past moment, thenthe present moment is future; and equally, if we were to pick a futureSpace and Time 179 moment, then the present moment is past. Thus, the present moment is not only present, but past and future as well. This reply in defense of his theory strikes me as wrongheaded in the extreme. It strikes me as analogous to, and as unacceptable as, the fol-lowing argument (where Carol plays the role of Future, Betty ofPresent, and Alice of P st). a Carol is taller than Betty, who in tur n is taller than Alice. F cus o your attention on Betty. Now, pick someone who is shorterthan Betty, e.g. Alice. Compared to Alice, Betty is tall. Nowpick someone who is taller than Betty, e.g. Carol. Compared toCarol, Betty is short. Betty is thus both short and tall. But being short and being tall are incompatible determinations. Thus Betty could not possibly exist. I suggest that McT ggart has made the equivalent error. That any mo- a ment of time may be present, and equally may - relative to some othermoments of time - be future, and equally may - relative to still othermoments of time - be past, does nothing to show that any moment oftime is both past, present, and future. No more than does your beingtaller than some persons and shorter than still others establish that youare both tall and short. One need not, then, conclude - as did McT g- a gart - that time is self-contradictory, and hence, that its very existenceis logically impossible. McT ggart 's theory of time, which virtually all commentators havea subsequently found curious, unorthodox, and - in the end - quiteunacceptable, was not just an isolated or insignicant fragment of hisphilosophizing. It stemmed in large measure from his inability toshake off the Augustinian concept of time, in which time was con-ceived as something ' moving ' from the future, through the present,and into the past. McT ggart marked the culmination, if not quite the a end, of a long era of conceiving of time in this familiar, even thoughconfused, manner. The moder n approach is, in a way, the very antith-esis of McT ggart 's. a McT ggart 's theory, like Augustine 's, was a positive theory: ita argued that there was something more to time than merely eventsstanding in temporal relations. (Other writers have called this addi-tional feature ' becoming ', and argued that becoming could not be accounted for within a negative theory, e.g. within a bare B-series.) Negative theorists propose, in contrast, that temporal relations can be180 Beyond Experience treated analogously to spatial relations and that adequate theories of time can be constructed by regarding time as nothing over and abovethe temporal relations events have to one another. What is currently regarded as being needed, both for metaphysics and for science, is a theory of time which is free of internal inconsis-tency and which is able to accommodate a variety of facts: (1) thattemporal events for m a series, i.e. that events may be earlier than, si-multaneous with, or later than other events; (2) that there is a present,a future, and a past; (3) that things change, evolve, grow, degenerate,etc.; and (4) that temporal relations - as attested to by the fact thatthey can be measured by scientic instruments with accuracies farbeyond what are psychologically possible - are not ' just in the mind ',but are objective facts of Nature. 8.6 The generalized concept of space Descartes and a number of subsequent philosophers, e.g. Locke, have argued that it is of the essence of material objects to be extended in space, i.e. to ' take up room ' as we might say more colloquially. Des- cartes wrote: \" ... nothing whatever belongs to the concept of body[i.e. material object] except the fact that it is something which haslength, breadth and depth and is capable of various shapes and mo-tions \" (Replies to the Sixth Set of Objections in [55], vol. I I, 297). Nothing is a material object, we are inclined to assert, if it is not ' extended ' in these three dimensions. Shadows cast by our bodies andimages projected on movie screens, while extended in two spatialdimensions, specically, while having width and height, lack the thirdspatial dimension, viz. depth, and are thus not accorded the status ofmateriality, are not, that is, regarded as being material objects. Being extended in three dimensions is not, however, a sufcient condition for being a physical object. It is merely a necessary condi-tion. Reflections in mirrors are three dimensional; so are well-craftedprojected holographic images. And yet neither reflections in mirrorsnor projected holographic images are material objects. Clearly some-thing more, besides being extended in three spatial dimensions, isrequired for something to count as being a bona de material object. What is the difference between - let us use as our example - a real (physical or material) chair and its reflection, both of which areextended in three dimensions? The crucial difference is that althoughthe real chair and its reflection in a mirror are both visible, only theformer is tangible. Put another way, we can say that although both theSpace and Time 181 real chair and its reflection exist in visual space , only the real chair, not its reflection, exists in tactile space . There are in this example two conceptually distinct spaces: that of sight and that of touch. There are, to be sure, remarkable correlations between the two, but the twospaces remain, nonetheless, conceptually distinct. Indeed each andevery sensory mode may be regarded as giving us access to a ' space ': 18there is the space of sight; of touch; of hearing; of temperature; etc. Whatever correlations there are in the data across sensory spaces (visual-auditory; visual-tactile; etc.) are both contingent and knowableonly by experience (i.e. knowable only a posteriori *). As infants we had to lear n by trial and error the connection between the visual and 19the tactile. W had to lear n that if something felt a certain way, then e it would (probably) look a certain way, and that if something looked acertain way, then it would (probably) feel a certain way. P rsons bor n e blind who, by surgery, have acquired sight as adults nd that it takesthem some months before they are able, using their eyes, to recognize 20objects which are perfectly familiar to their hands. As adults, theyhave had to lear n over a period of months, as the rest of us did as \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 18. \" Older babies live more and more in a world in which the infor mation from the senses is separated into a visual world [i.e. a visual space], anauditory world [space], and a tactual world [space] \" ([32], 47). 19. One of the most surprising ndings of experimental psychology is that newbor ns, in contrast to six-month-old infants, have an ability to reachdirectly for objects in their visual and auditory elds. Even blind newbor ns\" stare at their hands, tracking them with their unseeing eyes \" ([32], 69). Butthese sorts of innate abilities, strangely, seem to fade as the child growsduring the rst year, and come to be replaced in the second half-year afterbirth by lear ned hand movements guided initially by eye, and later, kines-thetically. These totally unexpected ndings provide a good object lessonagainst trying to do science in an a priori manner. Once again, we see howthe world often frustrates our naive anticipations of its manner of working. 20. In 1693, William Molyneux (1656-98) wrote to John Locke posing the following question (which has since come to be known as \" Molyneux 's prob-lem \"): \" Suppose a man bor n blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch todistinguish between a cube and a sphere. ... Suppose then the cube andsphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see. ... [I pose the fol-lowing question:] whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could nowdistinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube? \" ([124], book I I, chap. I X, \u00a78). Molyneux and Locke both agreed the newly sighted adult would not be able immediately to make the connection between his visual182 Beyond Experience infants, how to map the data of the visual and the tactile sensory modes back and forth. In talking and writing uncritically of space, we habitually overlook the differences between visual space and tactile space. But occasionalexceptions remind us that there really is not just a theoretical differ-ence between these two spaces, but a real one. P rsons bor n blind e have no experience of the features of visual space. But they can detectthe features of tactile space. They can tell, by feeling physical things,what their shapes are, how large they are, whether they are rough orsmooth, hard or soft, and where they are positioned in relation to other 21physical objects. F r the sighted, shadows and holographic images o occur in visual space but not in tactile space. And for all of us -sighted and sightless alike - there is at least the logical possibility, asis so often featured in ction, of invisible objects: things which aredetectable tactilely but not visually. Nonetheless, in spite of the real differences between visual and tac- tile space, there is - for the normally sighted among us - such a goodmapping between the contents of these two spaces that we tend naive-ly to regard these two spaces as one, real, unied, objective publicspace. W operate with the assumption that if something appears ine visual space, then it occurs in tactile space as well, and conversely. But it must be understood that this assumption of a single, unied space of sight and touch, handy as it is, is warranted by contingent facts about this particular possible world. It is not especially difcultto imagine how those facts could be otherwise. With a little ingenuity,we can invent possible-worlds tales in which the enormously usefulcorrelation we nd between the visual and tactile in this world simplydoes not exist. W can describe possible worlds in which your visual e data bear little if any detectable correlation with the data furnished byyour tactile senses. W can imagine a world, for example, where your e hands infor m you that you are feeling a teakettle in the cupboardbeside the stove, but where your eyes, at that very moment, tell youthat you are looking at a distant catamaran hauled up onto the sand of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and tactile data. Their scientic instincts were to prove correct. Moder n em- pirical research has conr med their prediction (see, e.g. [218], 204, and [83]). 21. They can also tell, with their ngers, whether something is hot or cold. But the temperature of things is not usually considered to be a tactile prop- erty, even though the nerve endings which are sensitive to temperature arelocated within our skins alongside our organs of touch.Space and Time 183 a windswept beach. Such a tale is merely an extension of the sorts of stories which are actually true of our visual and auditory senses. I amnow looking through an open window and can see rain falling outside.At the same time, I am also hearing Beethoven 's Archduke Trio (there is a recording playing in the adjoining room). I - like you - have nodifculty living simultaneously in the two, often disparate, sensoryspaces of sight and sound. The correlation between the two is oftenexceedingly poor. And from such an example, we can see how itcould be (i.e. how it is logically possible) that the correlation betweenthe visual and the tactile might be equally poor. The things we standardly regard as being material objects typically exist in (at least) two sensory spaces: the visual and the tactile. Is oneof these two spaces more fundamental in our attributing materiality toa thing? W uld we be inclined to attribute materiality to something o which was visible but not (even in principle) tangible? W uld we be o inclined to attribute materiality to something tangible but which wasinvisible? I think the answer is fairly clear. ' Merely visible ' things,e.g. shadows, reflections in mirrors, projected holographic images, are 22standardly regarded as nonphysical. In contrast, were we to nd a re-gion of space where our hands, sonar, etc. told us there was an object,but where our eyes were unable to detect anything, we would come,especially if the same results were obtained by other persons as well,to regard that place as being occupied by an invisible physical object. Granted, I may be misjudging the pre-analytic inclinations of other persons. I am, to be sure, depending heavily on assessments of how Iactually use the concept of material object in typical cases and of how I would use that concept in unusual cases. I am assuming, as a speakerand writer of a commonly shared language and of a more-or-less com-monly shared conceptual scheme, that my own use is fairly typical andthat my own leanings in this matter are reasonably representative of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22. The list of my examples may be contested. Some writers place reflections in mirrors in a different category than shadows and holograms. They arguethat in viewing a reflection in a mirror, e.g. of a chair, one is seeing a material object, viz. the chair, only one is seeing it in a somewhat misleading way, i.e.as if it were in a place where it is not in fact. Nothing I am saying depends onhow we choose to describe reflections in mirrors. Reflected images aremerely presented as a putative example of intangible visual data. If reflec-tions are not to be accorded this status, then - for the purposes of illustration- there are others: holograms and afterimages might serve nicely.184 Beyond Experience those of most other persons. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that I have diagnosed correctly both my own and other persons ' weight-ing of the various criteria for invoking the concept of material object : that most of us, if it came to having to choose between the tactileand the visual as being more fundamental to the concept of mater-iality, would choose the for mer. If this is in fact true, might therebe any explanation for it? Or, is it purely arbitrary which way wechoose? I think it is not. I think there is a profound reason why we regard the tactile as the more fundamental. And this reason has to do, onceagain, with the particular way this world is constructed. In some otherpossible worlds, the conscious creatures therein might, given the waytheir worlds are constructed, have good reason to regard the visual asmore fundamental than the tactile. I have in mind such facts as the following. Visual buses speeding toward oneself, e.g. images on movie screens, do not (with rare excep-tion, viz. for the fainthearted) injure or kill us; tactile buses do maimand kill. If you lived in a world whose visual images were like thoseof this world, and whose tactile images were like those of this world,but whose visual and tactile images bore no correlation one to another,then you would quickly have to lear n to act in accord with the tactiledata if you were to survive in that world and to disregard, save for itsentertainment value, the visual data. In this world, tactile knives cutour flesh and cause pain; visual knives do not. T ctile water slakes our a thirst; visual water does not. T ctile heaters war m our homes; visual a ones do not. All of the immediately foregoing data are contingent. The reported facts, e.g. about the respective dangers of visual and of tactile buses,hold for this particular possible world (and for some others), but notfor all. W can imagine possible worlds where precisely the opposite e would hold true: where visual buses, but not tactile ones, could kill;where visual water slaked thirst, but not tactile water; etc. In these lat-ter worlds, you would be well-advised to ignore what your ngers andhands were telling you and to pay close attention to what your eyesrevealed. It is a matter of course to believe uncritically that the data furnished by our eyes and by our ngers must coincide, that there is a single,unied world external to our skins, and that we have access to thatunied world through several sensory modes. But to the extent thatthis is true, it is not true of logical necessity, it is true sheerly as a mat-ter of contingency. The world did not have to be of this remarkablySpace and Time 185 convenient sort; it did not have to accommodate itself so handily to our several sensory modes so as to allow shared access by sight, bytouch, and (to a lesser degree) by hearing and smell. W can readily e describe worlds in which such redundancy is not the order of the day,indeed in which such redundancy does not exist at all. W take so e much for granted. W casually and naively assume that our sight and e our touch must reveal pretty much the same data about the world. Butthe truth is that there is no necessity in this happy fact at all. Theworld could have been vastly different. That it is this way, and not farless congenial, is really quite dumbfounding and wholly without natu- 23ral explanation. It is not only the coincidence of the visual and the tactile which is remarkable in our pre-analytic concept of physical bodies. It seemsnot to have occurred to Descartes at all that it might be possible for aphysical object to have fewer or more spatial dimensions than three.But by the end of the nineteenth century the idea was being activelyexplored. In 1884, Edwin Abbott (1838-1926) published an entertain-ing, and at the same time uncommonly ingenious, book Flatland ([1]) describing a possible world in which physical objects are two-dimen-sional. The theme has been taken up again, and much expanded, in 24Alexander Dewdney 's recent (1984) book, The Planiverse ([56]). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 23. One might think that the coincidence of our visual and tactile senses is no coincidence at all, that it can be explained as a product of evolution. But toargue in that fashion would be to miss the point. F r it even to be possible for o evolution to throw up visual and tactile senses which furnish correlative data,there must antecedently be correlative features in objects which can be accessed by different sensory modes. It is the very existence of such correla-tive features, even before evolution comes into play, that is the source of themarvel of this particular world. 24. Stephen Hawking, in A Brief History of Time , argues against the pos- sibility of there being two-dimensional creatures: \" If there were a passage[alimentary canal] right through its body, it would divide the creature intotwo separate halves; our two-dimensional being would fall apart ... Similarly,it is difcult to see how there could be any circulation of the blood in a two-dimensional creature \" ([87], 164). Neither of these arguments is particularlyeffective. Some paths through two-dimensional entities do allow for the separation of the two regions, e.g. a cut with scissors straight across a piece ofcardboard. But other paths, even though they create two (topologically)unconnected regions, do not allow for the separation of those two regions in a186 Beyond Experience Once one begins to speculate how different from this another world might be, and thus begins to realize the countless number of ways thisworld might have been less congenial and the countless number ofways it might have been more, the sheer contingency of our world looms as the most baffling, and in principle the most inexplicable,datum in all of Nature. Anyone who minimizes this aspect of meta-physics has depreciated its essence. 8.7 Extension in timeIn seventeenth-century physics, there was a quaint expression, \" punctifor m mass \" (sometimes \" punctual mass \"), which derived fromthe Latin \" punctum \", for \" point \". A punctifor m mass was, thus, amass (i.e. a physical body) which existed entirely ' at a single point '; itwas, that is, a zero-dimensional body. The notion of a punctifor mmass was invented because it provided a convenient means of solvingcertain, otherwise intractable, problems posed by the then-current stateof physics (footnote 10, p. 52). Even so, in spite of its usefulness incomputations, physicists who adopted the concept did so reluctantlyand hastened to point out that it was to be regarded as nothing morethan a convenient ction. No real body was conceived to exist only at one point: it was, they all insisted, in the very nature of physicalbodies to be extended in space. With the hindsight of moder n developments, both in physics and in philosophy, we perceive a curious imbalance in such earlier pro-nouncements. F r if it is in the nature of physical bodies to be ex- o \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 two-dimensional space, e.g. recall jigsaw puzzles. The pieces of assembled jigsaw puzzles, although distinct from one another, move about togetherbecause they are interlocked . One can gently tug sideways on the cor ner of such a puzzle, and all the interlocked pieces will move laterally together. Todisassemble such a puzzle (without destroying it), you must lift the pieces,one by one, up out of the plane of the puzzle, i.e. into the third dimension.But so long as you conne movement to a two-dimensional space, theassembled puzzle remains intact. In short, a simple way for a two-dimen-sional being to hold together, even though traversed by a canal, is that thecanal separating the parts be (roughly) Omega( )-shaped. And Hawking 's argument about the circulation of blood is no better. One easy way around thedifculty is to posit separate, self-contained circulatory systems in each' segment ' of the creature. Another way is to posit a creature (like countlessprimitive organisms on Earth) which have no circulatory systems at all.Space and Time 187 tended in space, then surely it must also be in their nature to be extended in time. An instantaneous object, one that exists solely for aninstant of time, i.e. does not endure for any fraction, however small, ofa second, is no physical object at all. Even the most ephemeral sub-atomic particles of moder n nuclear physics, particles which mighthave an entire lifetime of no more than one trillion-trillionth of asecond, at least have some nite temporal duration. But truly instan- taneous ' things ' cannot be regarded as having real existence. If one is going to opt for the theory that it is of the very nature of physical bodies to be extended in space, then by parallel reasoning (orby invoking analogous intuitions) one similarly ought to propose that 25it is of the very nature of physical bodies to be extended in time.There are perhaps many psychological theories why we human beingshave tended to regard space as more ' real ' than time and to conceiveof physical objects necessarily being extended in space but overlook- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 25. At the risk of confusing you, let me mention that time is a kind of ' space '. In just the way we saw in the previous section that things may beordered in a tactile space, or in an auditory space (some ' things ' are heard tobe near, others far; some soft, others loud; some low-, others high-pitched;etc.), things may also be ordered in time. Time is a one-dimensional space.(Recall McT ggart 's B-series.) Unfortunately, the potential for confusing a matters is so great in talking of time as being a kind of ' space ', that, havingnow made the point, I will drop it. I certainly do not wish to be thought to bearguing that time is the ' fourth ' dimension in the set {length, height, depth}.F r too much nonsense of this latter sort has already been promoted, since itsa inception, by misrepresentations and crude caricatures of relativity theory,and I have no wish to contribute further to it. The only point is that we cantalk both of the general concept of a space (e.g. tactile, auditory, olfactory spaces) and of the space of length, height, and depth. It is just a sorry fact of English that the identical word \" space \" is used both for the generalized con-cept and for a specic instance of that concept. It is almost as if we used thegeneralized word \" gure \" for both shapes in general and for some specicshape, e.g. squareness. Some writers use the ter m \" space \" in an even broader sense than that adopted in this book. F r example, in their discussion of persons searching o for an explanation how a certain programmable electromechanical deviceworks, Dunbar and Klahr ([61]) describe their subjects as ' searching thehypothesis space ' and ' exploring the experiment space '. Their appeal to a' space ' in this latter context - rather than to merely a collection or set - is aptto the degree that the contents (hypotheses and experiments, respectively) ofthe ' spaces ' referred to are capable of being ordered.188 Beyond Experience ing that they are equally necessarily extended in time. Whatever the psychological explanation may be, it is irrelevant for our purposes. Itsufces simply to call attention to our historical conceptual lopsided-ness about this issue. Some persons will try to explain the felt difference in our naive atti- tudes toward space and time in this way: \" Look at any physical objectyou like. The pencil in your hand will do as an example. Its entire spa-tial extent is given in your perception; you can see the whole spatialextent of the thing. But you cannot similarly see its entire temporalextent. Y u see only a brief segment of its total extent in time. Theo entire spatial extent is present at once, but not its temporal extent. \" Asintuitively appealing as such a line of argumentation may be, it iscuriously circular. In a way, it presupposes the very thing that needsexplaining. What does it mean to say that the entire spatial extent of the pencil is given in your perception? In looking at the pencil today, we certain-ly do not perceive what spatial extent that pencil may have hadyesterday or may come to have tomorrow. The pencil may have beensomewhat longer yesterday (it may have been sharpened and henceshortened last night); similarly it may be shorter again tomorrow. Inseeing its so-called entire spatial extent we are seeing only what spa-tial extent it has now. In looking at the pencil now, what we see is one ' snapshot ', if you will, in the entire ' lifetime ' of that pencil. The entirelifetime is composed of a continuous series of snapshots. If a physicalobject ever in its lifetime changes in size or shape, then at no momentof observation can we ever see ' the entire spatial extent ' of that object.What we in fact see in one episode of observation is but one thin' slice ' of its existence. Some objects, however, are vastly larger than pencils. Some objects are so immense in their spatial extent that we cannot, normally, per-ceive that expanse in any ' snapshot ' view. The Great W ll of China, a for example, meanders for a distance of more than 2400 kilometers (adistance equal, roughly, to that between P ris and Moscow). There is a no place on the face of the Earth where one can see both the easter nand the wester n termini of the W ll. And yet visitors to Beijing do a often report that they have ' seen the W ll ', have walked upon it, and a have photographed it. The Great W ll is extravagantly extended in a both space and time; and what counts as ' seeing the W ll ' is seeing a part of its colossal spatial extent and seeing part of its millennial tem- poral extent. One does not have to have seen the entire 2400-kilometerSpace and Time 189 length, nor to have been eyewitness to the unfolding of its thousand- year history, to be entitled to claim having seen the W ll. a Physical objects are multidimensional entities. In this world they are extended in three ' spatial ' dimensions, i.e. have width, height, anddepth. They are also extended along one temporal dimension, i.e. havesome denite (nite or perhaps innite) duration. Moreover, each ispositioned somewhere within the space (or along the continuum) ofmass, i.e. each physical object has some nonnegative mass. And inaddition each is positioned somewhere within the discrete (i.e. quan-tized) space of electrical charge, i.e. each physical object has anelectrical charge which is some integral multiple of a unit charge.Thus, to say, as is often said nowadays, that physical objects are' four-dimensional ' is actually to understate the case. Physical objectshave a number of dimensions beyond their spatial and temporal ones. F r our purposes, we will not pay much attention to such furthero dimensions as mass and electrical charge. It is not that these are unim-portant. It is simply that they are not of central concer n for the pur-poses of this chapter. Once one has expanded one 's horizon so as to conceive of physical objects, not in the seventeenth-century manner as things extendedmerely in width, height, and depth, but in the moder n fashion asthings extended in width, height, depth, and time, then some quite re-markable benets accrue. One particular benet, which we will explore in the next section, is the startling insight we are given into the profound analogy betweenspace (i.e. the space of width, height, and depth) and time. Manyancient beliefs - such as that it is possible to move about in space butnot in time - are exposed as being straightforwardly based on a confu-sion and are simply mistaken. The second benet, to be explored in chapter 11, is that we have a means to solve McT ggart 's puzzle about change. Or, if you happen to a think McT ggart 's puzzle is bogus to begin with and not in need of a ' solving ', then at least we have a means to address seriously the prob-lem of change without having to posit a super-time against which timeitself is moving. By conceiving of physical objects as being thingsextended in time, we have the conceptual equipment needed to explainchange, by identifying change not as a movement of time, but asthings having different properties at different times. It is things whichchange their properties in time; not time itself which changes relativeto a super-time.190 Beyond Experience Let us tur n, then, to examine the rst of these alleged benets, the revealing of the nature and extent of the formal similarity betweenspace and time. 8.8 T ylor on spatial and temporal analogiesa Over the course of your intellectual life, there will be, if you are fortu- nate, a number of occasions where a particular lecture, article, or bookwill prove revelatory. Y u will happen upon an outstanding piece of o work which will open your eyes to a new way of seeing the familiar orseeing through the confusing. In my own career, such a piece of phi-losophy has been Richard T ylor 's 1955 paper \" Spatial and T mporal ae Analogies and the Concept of Identity \" ([203]). I regard his paper as 26one of the classics of moder n philosophy. T ylor undertakes to prove that there are many more formal* simi- a larities between space and time than are usually recognized; he doesthis by showing that several of the alleged differences between space 27and time are just that, alleged, not real. T argue for these similari- o ties, T ylor begins by pointing out that many temporal concepts havea ' counterparts ' (or analogs) among spatial concepts, e.g. the temporalconcept now has an obvious spatial counterpart, here. So numerous are these pairings, that we can set up a mapping, or lexicon (see p.191), for ' translating ' between temporal concepts and their spatialanalogs. The ter ms \" T \", \" T \", etc. designate specic moments of time, 1 2 e.g. 14:31 Easter n Standard Time on 12 August 1948, or the moment when Columbus rst set foot on the continent of North America, etc.;while \" P \", \" P \", etc. designate specic places, e.g. the northeast 1 2 cor ner of the Acropolis, or sixty kilometers due east of the geographi- cal center of Ottawa, Ontario. There is, of course, one striking disanalogy between temporal and spatial ter ms: although there is but one temporal dimension, there are \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 26. T ylor credits Donald Williams ([213]) and Nelson Goodman ([81]) witha having laid the groundwork for his own inquiries. 27. The qualication \" several \" is important; so is the characterization \" for- mal similarities \". T ylor is not arguing for the perfect (i.e. complete) similar- a ity of space and time; still less that space and time are ' one and the samething ' (see footnote 25, p. 187). He is arguing only that space and time sharemore formal analogies than had previously been believed. In the next section,8.9, I will explore one way in which time is not analogous to space.Space and Time 191 Lexicon Time Space____ ______ \"at a time T , T a place P , ...\"1 2 1 2 \"is earlier than\" north of \" \"lasts (endures) for 1 minute\" \"stretches for 1 meter \"\"occupies ( lasts throughout) \"occupies the region the interval T -T \" between P and P \" 1 2 1 2 etc. etc. three spatial ones. T map the temporal \" earlier / later \", we must o choose one of the three spatial candidates: I have chosen \" north /south \". (W simply ignore in this exercise \" east / west \" and \" up / e down \"; these latter spatial ter ms will not be assigned temporal coun-terparts. And we will ignore, too, that the dimension \" north / south \"has endpoints [the poles] while \" earlier / later \" may not.) A crucial concept in this exercise is that of part. Normally, when we think of the parts of things we think of their spatial parts. If a thing, e.g. the Trans-Canada Highway, stretches across the continentthrough Canada, then that part which stretches from the border ofBritish Columbia and Alberta to the border of Manitoba and Ontariomay be considered a spatial part of the highway. But insofar as physi-cal things are extended both in space and in time (see section 8.7), wemay speak of their temporal parts with as much propriety as we do oftheir spatial parts. If an object endures, let us say from 12 October1928 to 19 February 1998, then the temporal interval 23 July 1933through 5 September 1941 may be regarded as a temporal part of the object. Looking at the last item in our lexicon, we can explain readily the concept of an object O ' lasting throughout ' a temporal interval T -T : 1 2 at every moment (instant) between T and T , including the two in-1 2 stants T and T themselves, there exists some temporal part (called a1 2 \" T-part \") of the object O. Similarly, for an object to occupy the (or better \" a \") region between P and P means this: at every point along1 2192 Beyond Experience some continuous spatial path (there are of course an innite number of such paths) connecting P and P there exists some spatial part ( S-part)1 2 of the object O. (Note that the path need not be a straight line. Boo- merangs [at rest] occupy a continuously connected region of spacewithout occupying the region along the straight line connecting theirends.) With the Lexicon in hand, we can proceed to examine several of T ylor 's quite remarkable and startling theses.a Thesis: Just as an object may be at one place at two different times, an object may at one time be at two different places. This thesis is surprising just because it has been so often denied. Indeed it is vir-tually axiomatic in many persons ' thinking about space and time thatone object may be at one place at two different times, but that oneobject cannot be at one time in two different places. Their argument might be something of this sort: \" This pen which I have carried aboutin the city today, last night sat on my desk here at home. I am nowputting it back on my desk precisely where it had been last night.Y sterday it was in a certain place; today it is back in that very samee place. At two different times it has occupied the same place. But noone thing can be in two different places at the same time. If the pen isnow on the cor ner of my desk, it cannot also now be ve kilometersaway, on the floor of the public library. \" So familiar is this sort ofargument, that one wonders how it is even possible to challenge it. ButT ylor does so, and does so successfully.a The problem with the argument just given is that it omits to mention one exceedingly important fact. It will not do, for the purposes ofarguing that one object can be in the same place on two different occa-sions, to talk about a certain pen last night and about a different pen (however similar) which occupies that place today. It must be one andthe same pen. But how is the identity of today 's pen with the penwhich existed last night to be accounted for? The usual way for thepen which exists today to be reckoned as being the same pen as onewhich existed last night is for the pen of last night to have remained in 28existence until the present moment. But once that presupposition inthe description of the situation is made explicit, then the argument - \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 28. Whether existing throughout the interval is the only way for the pen which exists today to be reckoned as being the same pen as the one whichexisted last night is a question which is postponed until chapter 11. There (inSpace and Time 193 when repaired - proves not what it is usually thought to prove but precisely its contrary. Let us see why. The standard way in which it is possible for an object O to exist in one place at two different times comes about through that object 'sexisting at all times throughout that temporal interval. Using symbols,we may express the point this way: O is at P at T 1 1 O is at P at T (where T T )1 2 1 2 O exists throughout the temporal interval T -T1 2 If this is what is typically involved in an object 's being at one place at two different times, then we may state the analogous thesis - for anobject 's being at one time in two different places - by using the Lexi-con to translate all of the temporal ter ms to spatial ter ms and all thespatial ter ms to temporal. The correct, or fully stated, analog thusbecomes: O is at T at P 1 1 O is at T at P (where P P )1 2 1 2 O exists throughout the spatial interval P -P1 2 Is it possible for anything to satisfy these latter conditions? If there is any such thing, then it is a thing which at one time is in two differentplaces. As it tur ns out, there are countless numbers of actual thingssatisfying precisely these conditions. There is no need in this instanceto take recourse to possible-worlds tales. The actual world provides usuntold numbers of examples. The Mississippi River, for example, sat-ises the just-stated conditions. At any one time it exists in two differ-ent places (e.g. in Memphis and in New Orleans) and exists through-out a spatial interval between those two places (viz. along a paththrough Vicksburg, Natchez, Baton Rouge, etc.). What is commonly found in cases where an object (e.g. the pen) ex- ists at two different times in the same place is that the object is tem-porally large enough to span the temporal interval from the one timeto the other. In similar fashion, an object (e.g. the Mississippi River or \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 footnote 11, pp. 344ff., and again in section 11.6.5) we will examine the pos- sibility of identity at two different times without identity through all interven-ing intervals. But for the moment we ignore that complication.194 Beyond Experience the Great W ll of China) can exist at two different places at the same a time by being spatially large enough to span the spatial interval fromthe one place to the other. There is an obvious objection to be anticipated. Someone might protest that in the case of the pen being on the desk last night andbeing there again today, the entire pen is present on both occasions; but in the case of the Mississippi River 's being present in both Mem-phis and New Orleans, the entire river is not present at either place,only a relatively short stretch of the river 's very considerable length ispresent at either place. But this objection fails to carry through theanalogy in its full. What exactly is present, at any given time, whenthe pen is on the desk? Certainly not the complete temporal extent ofthe pen, but only a temporal part. What exactly is present, of the Mis-sissippi River, at any given place, e.g. at Memphis or at New Orleans?Not the entire spatial extent of the river, certainly, but only limitedspatial parts. It is by identifying \" parts \" with \" spatial parts \" and overlooking \" temporal parts \" that one falls into the mistaken belief that the pen iswholly present at any particular time. But once one recognizes thatobjects are extended both in space and in time, and that at any oneplace there exists only a spatial part of an object, and that at any onetime there exists only a temporal part of an object, then one can nallyunderstand how objects can be both in one place at two different timesand at one time in two different places. An object can be in one placeat two different times if it is (temporally) long enough to extend (intime) from the one time to the other; an object can be at one time intwo different places if it is (spatially) long enough to extend (in space)from the one place to the other. What, nally, are we to say, then, of the often-proclaimed dictum that it is impossible for one object to be in two places at the sametime? T ylor has shown us one way in which an object can be in two a places at the same time. My right ar m is too short (in its spatial extent)to allow it at any one time to be both in my ofce and in my livingroom. (Some three kilometers separates the two places.) But that sameright ar m is quite long enough to be both on the ar mrest of my chairand on my desk. As a matter of fact it is in both places now, as I write these very words. This is as far as T ylor 's rst thesis takes us. But we would do well a to linger a moment to ask one more question before moving on to hisnext thesis. Is the way described in T ylor 's rst thesis the only way aSpace and Time 195 for an object to be in two places at the same time? Must every object which is in two places at one time span a path between the two places?It tur ns out, surprisingly, that there are certain sorts of objects whichcan occupy two or more places at once without occupying any inter- vening places. F r there are certain things which we count as ' objects ' o and yet which may be scattered about at a variety of places. Such' scattered objects ' are sometimes called \" assemblages \" or \" collec-tions \". The items of clothing which make up my wardrobe, the indi-vidual books which make up my personal library, the ships compris-ing the U.S. Sixth Fleet, are all examples of such ' scattered objects '. Where, exactly, is my wardrobe? Most of it is in my bedroom closet;some of it is on my body; some of it is in my dresser; some is in thelaundry room; some is at the dry cleaners; and some is hanging on ahook in my ofce at the university. My wardrobe is, thus, now atseveral different places. More exactly, spatial parts of my wardrobeare at several different places. But what makes my wardrobe differentfrom other objects which are also at different places at one and thesame time is that the various spatial parts of my wardrobe are not spa-tially connected one to another; they exist at different places without occupying the intervening places. W often overlook the category of ' scattered objects ', believinge uncritically that all objects must have spatially connected parts. Butthere are too many counterexamples to allow us to sustain this naivebelief. Where, for example, is Indonesia? or Michigan? or Hawaii?There is no land route through Hawaii connecting Lihue with Hilo.The norther nmost island in the chain (where Lihue is located) is un-connected by land to the souther nmost island (where Hilo is). (Seegure 8.2, p. 196) Y t, if we want to believe that Hawaii is some- e where, i.e. has a place, then we are forced to recognize that somespatial objects (in this example, a large geographical object) do havespatially disconnected parts. And thus not only is it possible for anobject to be at different places at the same time, some quite familiarobjects are at different places at the same time; moreover, some of these latter objects (e.g. your wardrobe, the state of Hawaii) have spa-tial parts which are disconnected from one another. Thesis: Time need not be regarded as essential to change. Things may change in space just as well as in time. If by \" change \" we stipulate that we mean temporal processes, then this claim is legislated to be false by denition. But should we be hasty to make the stipulation?196 Beyond Experience Figure 8.2 What does it mean for some object to change in time? There are at least two things that might be meant: (1) that the object changes itsplace, or (2) that the object changes its properties. If being at different places at different times counts as a ' change in time ', then the spatial analog is trivially satisable. Using the Lexicon,the analogy becomes, ' being at different times at different places '. Butthis latter is precisely the identical condition, simply restated equiva- lently. In short, change of place through time just is change of time from place to place. Things which move about in time from place toplace also move about in space from one time to another. Movementin place through time is as much movement in time as it is movementin space. What about ' change in properties ' through time? An iron object may start out in a glistening, polished state at T . But over time, with- 1 out changing its place, it may gradually rust, so that at T it is con-2 siderably rusted. Is there a spatial analog? Can an object change its properties through space, i.e. at one time have different properties indifferent places? It is easy to describe such cases. One end of an ironobject, at P , may be in a glistening, polished state. But at the very 1 same time, along the spatial extent of the object, there is more and more rust. At its other end, at P , it is considerably rusted. The degree2 of rust progresses, not through time, but through space. This certainly presents itself as a change, only a change in space, not in time.Space and Time 197 From a formal point of view, objects can ' change ' as easily in space as they can in time. There seems to be no good reason to restrict theconcept of change solely to change in time . Thesis: In just the way in which it is possible for things to change their spatial positions and relations, it is possible for things to changetheir temporal positions and relations. Change in spatial position is familiar: an object O which had been north of another, O , may later 12 come to be south of that object. But can an object O which had been1 earlier than O come to be later than O ? T ylor argues that the answera22 is Y s, if we take care to spell out the analogy in full. W begin byee stating the conditions for change in spatial positions: O at T is north of O1 1 2 O at T is south of O1 2 2 Using the Lexicon, we create the temporal analog: O at P is earlier than O1 1 2 O at P is later than O1 2 2 Is this possible? Can an object (or event) occur before another at some place P and after that other at a different place P ? Y s, there aree12 indeed such events. Imagine four persons positioned at equal intervals along a straight line. (See gure 8.3, p. 198.) Alice is at position zero; Betty, one-thirdof a kilometer further along; Carol, at two-thirds of a kilometer fromposition zero; and Diane, fully one kilometer beyond position zero.They all have synchronized watches, and at 12 noon, Alice res astarter 's pistol and Diane strikes a drum once. Since sound travelsthrough air at 331 m / sec, just about one second later, at 12:00:01 P M, Betty hears the pistol shot and Carol hears the drumbeat. And onesecond after that, at 12:00:02 P M, Betty hears the drumbeat and Carol, the pistol shot. Where Betty is standing, the sound of the pistol occursone second earlier than the sound of the drum. Where Carol is stand-ing, the order is reversed: the sound of the drum occurs one secondbefore the sound of the pistol. A now-familiar objection may be expressed: \" When we speak of an object changing its position in space, the entire object is present rst at one and then the other location. But in this example, the ' entire 'event - the gunshot or the drum stroke - is not present at eitherplace. \" But, in light of the earlier discussion, the counterobjection198 Beyond Experience Figure 8.3Space and Time 199 should be clear. As objects move about in space, at any given time what is present at a given place is only a temporal-part ( T-part) of that object. In the example of the gunshot and the drumbeat, what isrequired for the analogy to be complete is that at any given place whatis present at a given time is only a spatial-part ( S-part) of the object. And this latter condition is precisely satised. As each of the two' objects ', the gunshot and the drumbeat, spread out through space (at331 m / sec), spatial-parts occur at given places at given times. Theanalogy is thus complete. McT ggart, we will recall (see above, p. 176), had explicitly denieda that events can change their temporal relations: \" If M is ever earlier than N, it is always earlier \" ([130], \u00a7305). The present example shows that McT ggart 's claim is not unconditionally true. McT ggart had aa overlooked the fact that certain events are of a sort which propagatethrough space. F r such events, their order of occurrence can, and o will, vary from place to place. F r McT ggart 's claim to be made true, o a it will have to be qualied in this way: \" If M is ever earlier at some given place than N, it is always earlier at that place than N. \" Thesis: T the extent that things can ' tarry ' in space, they can as wello in time. This thesis has often been denied. Things need not move about in space, it is alleged, but nothing can fail to move forward intime. Everything ' grows older ', i.e. moves through time. If, as has often been alleged, things need not move about in space, i.e. can tarry in space, can we construct an analog for something 's notmoving about in time? F r an object to tarry in space means simply o that it remains at one place during some temporal interval. F rmally, o this may be expressed this way: O is at P throughout the temporal interval T -T 1 1 1 2 Using the Lexicon it is easy to construct the spatial analog: O is at T throughout the spatial interval P -P1 1 1 2 Rewriting to make the English slightly more idiomatic, we get: At T , O exists throughout the spatial interval P -P .1 1 1 2 These latter conditions are trivially simple to satisfy. Any object O1 which, at some particular moment of time T , extends from place P to11 P is occupying a given time throughout some spatial interval. F r a2 from tarrying in time being impossible, it would seem that every physical object which takes up any space whatsoever must satisfy200 Beyond Experience these conditions. The spatial analog of ' moving through time ' is noth- ing more, or less, than being extended in space. T ' grow older ' is to o move through time, i.e. to occupy successive points of time. The spa-tial analog is simply occupying successive points of space. Thesis: In just the way in which things may move back and forth in space, they may also move back and forth in time. This thesis is the highlight of T ylor 's paper. It is the most startling and provocative a thesis of the lot. W must begin by attending to the formal conditions for movinge forward and backward in space. Obviously, we will have to refer tothree different times. W will talk of T , T , and T , where T is the rst e 1 2 3 1 in the series and T the last. In English, we can state the conditions this3 way: \" At rst, at T , the object is at place P , but not at place P . Some-11 2 time later, at T , the object is at (i.e. has moved to) place P , and is, of22 course, no longer (i.e. at T ) at its original place P . At a still later time,21 T , the object has moved back to its original place, P , and is (of31 course) no longer at P . \"2 At T : T-part of O is at P ; and [at T ]11 1 1 no S-part of O is at P .2 At T : T-part of O is at P ; and [at T ]22 2 2 no S-part of O is at P .1 At T : T-part of O is at P ; and [at T ]33 1 3 no S-part of O is at P .2 The temporal-counterpart may now be constructed. W will let P , P , e1 2 and P be any three ordered positions in space.3 At P : S-part of O is at T ; and [at P ]11 1 1 no T-part of O is at T .2 At P : S-part of O is at T ; and [at P ]22 2 2 no T-part of O is at T .1 At P : S-part of O is at T ; and [at P ]33 1 3 no T-part of O is at T .2 A bus shuttling back and forth between V ncouver and Burnaby a satises the for mer of these two sets of conditions, i.e. it is movingback and forth in space. What is an example of something which satis-es the latter set of conditions?Space and Time 201 T nd such an example, we need to look more closely at what it iso to move back and forth in space. If we examine the rst set of condi-tions very closely, we see that they satisfy the following, alter native,description: \" Consider three ordered moments of time, T , T , and T . 1 2 3 If we trace the path through these three points, we discover that at the rst time, the object is at P , at the second time the object is at a differ-1 ent place P , but when we get to the third and last time, we discover2 that the object is ' back at ' P again. \"1 Applying the Lexicon to this latter description, we can state the for- mal conditions for moving back and forth in time in this equivalent,more intuitive fashion: \" Consider three ordered points of space, P , P , 1 2 and P . If we trace the path through these three points, we discover3 that at the rst place, the object is there at T , at the second place the1 object is there at a different (later) time T , but when we get to the2 third and last place, we discover that the object is there at T (i.e. has1 already been there at the same time it was at P ). \" In short, what is1 required for something 's moving back and forth in time is for a thing to be simultaneously at places P and P and to be at P (between those1 3 2 two places) at some other time. Could anything possibly satisfy these conditions? Any -shaped object possesses the necessary spatial features to be able to move back and forth in time. Consider a -shaped object O, moving northward. (See gure 8.4, p. 202.) If we choose three places,P , P , and P [W ston, Centralia, and Eastwich], lying along a west-e 1 2 3 east axis, the tips of the will pass at T (viz. simultaneously) over P11 [W ston] and P [Eastwich], while the cusp of the will lie to the e3 south of P [i.e. south of Centralia]. Sometime later, at T , the tips of22 the will have passed beyond P [W ston] and P [Eastwich], but the e13 cusp of the will be at P [Centralia]. If one traces the spatial path2 from P to P and from P to P , one will discover that as one1 2 2 3 progresses, O will be at P [W ston] at T ; at P [Centralia] at T ; and - e1 1 2 2 surprisingly - as one gets to the third and nal point, P [Eastwich],3 one discovers that O has already been there, simultaneously with its earlier occurrence at P [at W ston]. Thus this object has satised per-e129fectly the formal conditions for ' moving back and forth in time '. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 29. My thanks to Professor Leslie Ballentine for calling my attention to a special feature of this and all other known examples of things which travelback and forth in time. Notice how, in this example, the object O is ' bent '202 Beyond Experience Figure 8.4Space and Time 203 The pivotal point in this last thesis - \" In just the way in which things may move back and forth in space, they may also move backand forth in time \" - is, of course, in the qualication, \" in just theway \". F r it is not being claimed, for example, that you can now, aso an adult, travel backward in time and shake hands with yourself as aneight-year-old, or that you can travel forward to the future and attend 30your own funeral. The claim here is far more modest. It is beingclaimed only that in the way in which it is possible for (a temporal-part of ) an object rst to be at one place, (a temporal-part) to be laterat another place, and still later (a temporal-part) to be back at the rstplace, then in a parallel way it is possible for (a spatial-part of ) anobject at one place to occur at a certain time, (a spatial-part) to bepresent at a further place at a later time, and (a spatial-part) to be pres-ent at a still further place at the same time as (a spatial-part of ) it oc-curred in the rst place. If the for mer of these situations is to count as' moving about in space ', then the latter is entitled to be regarded as' moving about in time '. 318.9 Is there a temporal analog of the \" right / left \" problem? Immanuel Kant seems to have been the rst philosopher to have been intrigued by the differences between what, in moder n ter minology, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 in two spatial dimensions, viz. it was -shaped. In order to cite an actual example, it was necessary to invoke a spatial object having (at least) twospatial dimensions. It is theoretically possible that movement back and forth in time should occur for an object which is not ' bent ' in space. But it seemsto be a contingent fact of this world, however, that the only objects which domove back and forth in time are of the sort described, i.e. are objects whichare curved in two or more spatial directions. 30. What characterizes these latter two examples is that two temporal stages, or T-parts, of an object are simultaneously present at a place. Nothing in T ylor 's argument permits such an occurrence. Whether ' moving about ina time ' in this latter sense - in which two distinct T-parts of an object may be simultaneously present - is coherent will be examined later (in section 8.11). 31. This section is a slightly revised and expanded version of the article, \" Is There an Ozma Problem for Time? \" which originally appeared in Analysis 33, no. 3 (Jan. 1973), 77-82. I am pleased to acknowledge my indebtedness toJ.F. Bennett 's ne paper \" The Difference between Right and Left \" ([26])which examined the spatial version of the problem which provokes this pres-ent discussion.204 Beyond Experience have come to be called \" incongruous counterparts \" or - more techni- cally still - \" enantiomorphs \". Enantiomorphs are mirror images of oneanother, although not all mirror images are enantiomorphs. The mirrorimage of the letter \" A \" is not an enantiomorph; the mirror image of the letter \" Z \" is. The difference is that there is a (vertical) axis of symmetry in the letter \" A \", i.e. the letter is symmetrical about its verti- cal axis: . The letter \" Z \" has no axis of symmetry, either vertically |\u2014 or horizontally: Z Z . Hence the letter \" Z \" and its mirror image for m a , pair of enantiomorphs. Enantiomorphs may be pairs of one-dimensional or pairs of three-dimensional gures. Theone-dimensional gures \u2014 \u2014 - - \u2014 \u2014 are enantiomorphs. Neither one can be moved in a one-dimensional space (i.e. slid sideways) so as to be made to coincide with the other.Of course, if either one were to be rotated in a two-dimensional space,e.g. in the plane of this page on which they are printed, they could bemade to coincide. The two-dimensional gures b and d are enan- tiomorphs: neither can be moved about (including being rotated) intwo-dimensional space so as to allow it to coincide with the other. But q while b and d are enantiomorphs, b and are not: either one can be moved (rotated) so as to permit it to coincide with the other. p Similarly d and are non-enantiomorphs, i.e. are congruous g- ures. Kant 's examples (1783) were of three-dimensional enantiomorphs: \" ... the left hand cannot be enclosed in the same bounds as the rightone (they are not congruent); the glove of one hand cannot be used forthe other \" ( Prolegomena [107], \u00a713). A right-handed glove cannot be rigidly moved about in three-dimensional space so as to be made to ta left hand. It can, of course, be tur ned inside out, and that will do thetrick. But tur ning a glove inside out is not a rigid movement throughspace. It involves stretching or bending the object. F r two objects to o be regarded as enantiomorphs, it is necessary that they cannot bebrought into coincidence (i.e. cannot be made congruent) withoutbending or stretching. What is there about the right- and the left-handed gloves which accounts for their being enantiomorphs of one another? Each glove wemay suppose is made of the same sort of material as its mate, eachweighs the same as the other, each has the same total volume as theother, and each has a thumb, followed in order by four ngers: theSpace and Time 205 index (or forenger), the middle, the third, and the so-called little nger. Even so, for all these similarities, there is a profound differ-ence, as all of us who have ever mistakenly tried to t a left-handedglove on our right hand know very well. Of course we can put labelsto these differences: we can say that one of these gloves is \" left \"-handed and the other \" right \". But the important question - for Kantand subsequent writers - has been whether or not these ter ms \" right \"and \" left \" could ever be lear ned by someone who had not experienced the sort of difference exhibited by the pair of gloves. A century later, Kant 's problem about the difference between \" right \" and \" left \" appears in William James 's Principles of Psychol- ogy, where it can be seen to be evolving into a problem about com- munication : \" If we take a cube and label one side top, another [presumably the side parallel to it] bottom, a third front and a fourth [again, presumably, the side parallel to the latter] back, then there remains no for m of words by which we can describe to another personwhich of the remaining sides is right and which is left \" ([103], vol. I I, 150). James 's claim, obviously, needs to be qualied. F r there is one, o trivial, way in which we can describe the difference. W can call the e one \" right \" and the other \" left \". But we see what James was gettingat, even if he managed to express himself poorly. Suppose you are in telephone contact with someone and are trying to get her to duplicate a certain cube whose faces you have labeled ina particular fashion. (See gure 8.5, p. 206.) Y u want the front o labeled with a single dot; the back labeled with two dots; the top, withthree; the bottom, with four; the left, with ve; and the right, with six.Y u begin by telling her to pick any side and label it with one dot; to o move to the parallel (opposite) side and label it with two dots. Thenshe can choose any one of the remaining four sides and label it withthree dots; and fourthly she is to label with four dots the side parallelto the one bearing the three dots. But now there is a problem (James 'sproblem). In assigning the next two sets of dots, she cannot just ar-bitrarily pick one of the two remaining sides and label it with vedots, and the sixth, the last, remaining side with the set of six dots: shehas to get the fth choice, the left-hand side, correct. She has to puther ve dots on the same side, the left-hand side, as you have put yourve dots. Y u have, that is, to make sure that she is using the ter ms o \" left \" and \" right \" in the same way you are, and has not - somehow -got them reversed. (Some persons, we know all too well, frequentlymistake the two directions, right and left. P rhaps your telephone cor- e respondent is confused or, even worse, was taught to speak English by206 Beyond Experience Figure 8.5 someone with a perverse sense of humor.) How can you make sure that she is using the ter ms \" left \" and \" right \" as you do? Y u realize that you can solve the problem if you can gure out ino which hand she is holding the telephone headset. Y u ask her, and she o replies \" my right hand \". But still you are not sure that she is using theter ms \" right \" and \" left \" just as you do. There are various ways youmight go about trying to determine whether she is using the words inthe same way as you, or in the reverse manner. Y u might ask her, fur- o ther, whether she was holding the headset in the hand which is on thesame side of her body as her appendix. In this latter instance, youwould be assuming that her body was anatomically similar to that ofnearly every other woman. Or, again, you might ask her to look up inthe night sky and describe, using the ter ms \" right \" and \" left \", the spa-tial relations of various constellations to one another. So long as youcould see those constellations, then you could quickly tell whether shewas using the ter ms \" right \" and \" left \" as you do, or whether she hadgot them ' reversed '. It is clear that there are a variety of ways to tell whether someone, out of sight, with whom you are communicating uses the ter ms \" right \"Space and Time 207 and \" left \" in the same, or a reversed, manner. But all of these ways, it seems, involve presupposing that you and the other person haveaccess to one or more shared enantiomorphs: the asymmetrical dis-position of internal organs (e.g. the appendix) in the human body,overhead stellar constellations, etc. The problem is ' cranked up a notch ' when these latter, obvious, solutions are explicitly disallowed. Suppose in the Search for Extra-T rrestrial Intelligence (see the discussion of S E T I in section 5.2, pp. e 80ff.), you are in communication with a distant intelligence, on aplanet so shrouded by a dense cloud cover that there is no opportunityfor you and her to observe any physical object in common. Moreover,her own body is not at all humanoid. She does not even have anappendix. Of course she does not speak English or any other Earth-based language. Y u communicate via a code, similar to Morse code, o i.e. of pulsating signals. Presuming you could even get to the point ofintelligible conversation (again, see section 5.2), could you gure outwhich ter m in her language meant \" right \" and which \" left \"? Martin Gardner, in his Ambidextrous Universe , states the problem in this manner: Is there any way to communicate the meaning of \" left \" by a language transmitted in the for m of pulsating signals? By theter ms of the problem we may say anything we please to our lis-teners, ask them to perfor m any experiment whatever, with oneproviso: There is to be no asymmetric object or structure that we and they can observe in common. ([75], 160) Gardner calls this the \" Ozma problem \". (He has borrowed the name from the Ozma project, a 1960 project of S E T I, whose director, Frank D. Drake, in tur n had borrowed the name from a character in a bookby L. Frank Baum.) The Ozma problem has never been raised in regard to any but spa- tial relations. Is this just lack of imagination? Richard T ylor, we have a already seen (section 8.8), has argued persuasively for a very muchmore thorough analogy between spatial and temporal relations thanhad previously been thought possible. How much further can we pressthe analogy? Specically, can we construct an Ozma problem fortime? Is there, that is, a problem with \" earlier / later \" analogous to\" right / left \"? The task divides into two stages. First we must for mu-late the proper analogy, and second we must investigate whether theproblem is solvable.208 Beyond Experience F r current purposes, the Lexicon given above (p. 191) is inade-o quate. W will require one modication and two additions. Where wee had earlier mapped \" earlier / later \" onto \" north / south \", we will nowmap the for mer onto \" left / right \". And in order to translate Gardner 'sstatement of the spatial Ozma problem into its temporal equivalent,we will have to have dictionary equivalents for both \" pulsating sig-nals \" and \" asymmetric object \". \" Pulsating signals \" may be taken to mean something like \" a series of markers (e.g. audible beeps and their absences) arranged in a tem-poral order \". Implicit in Gardner 's story is that the signals or mes-sages should be received during a time, i.e., consecutively, but at oneplace. A T ylor-analog could, then, be something of this sort: \" a series a of markers arranged in a spatial order \". T ensure the completeness of o the analogy we must add the rider that this message should bereceived within a spatial extent but all at one time. A notched iron bar,for example (where the notches are the coded message), would satisfythe description. The message is extended over a space (i.e. the lengthof the bar) and is all of it simultaneously present. The temporal analog of a spatially asymmetric object is easy to name but perhaps slightly more difcult to explain. A temporallyasymmetric object is one for which there is no moment such that thehistory of the object up to that moment is the ' reflection ' of the futureof that object subsequent to that moment. Noticeably the explanationseems to be infected with a slight residue of spatial terminology, viz.\" reflection \". The ter m is, however, a mere convenience. W have e many more occasions to speak of spatial reflections than of temporal ones, but the suitability of the ter m for both contexts should be obvi-ous. Most objects are temporally asymmetric, but not quite all. With alittle ingenuity we can actually make a temporally symmetric object.F r example, a pure pitch of constant volume, physics tells us, wouldo sound exactly the same if recorded and played backward. There is insuch an example a temporal axis of symmetry: there is some moment,the midtime of its duration, about which the sound is temporallysymmetric, i.e. reflected. It is important to note for our discussion below that physical ob- jects, too, are very often temporally symmetric within selected timeintervals. F r example, the notched iron bar which we have alluded to o may for years undergo no internal physical change whatever. Duringthat segment of its total history it is temporally symmetric. If nothingis happening to it over a course of, let us say, two centuries, then theSpace and Time 209 description we give of what happens to it from the rst year to the end of the one hundredth year is precisely the same as any description wegive of it from the end of the two hundredth year (backward) to thebeginning of the one-hundred-and-rst year. Putting the matter per-haps a bit cryptically: we cannot tell by examining the bar during thattwo-hundred-year interval whether it is growing older or younger. Inthis respect it is the temporal analog of a spatial object which has nopreferred direction, e.g. William James 's cube. F r fairly obvious reasons in the statement of the temporal Ozmao problem only temporally symmetric objects are to be mutually acces-sible to both of the communicators. Allowing a bit of judicious edit-ing, the problem emerges thus: Is there any way to communicate the meaning of \" earlier than \" by a message transmitted all at once by a series of spatiallyarranged markers? By the ter ms of the problem we may sendany message we please, with one proviso: There is to be notemporally asymmetric object or structure to which the senderand receiver have mutual access. Does this problem really make sense? Can there be a problem about communicating the meaning of \" earlier than \" at all analogous to theproblem of communicating the meaning of \" left of \"? W understand e how one person communicating with another by telephone should befrustrated in trying to tell the other person, who did not already know,which was her left hand and which her right. Could there really be aproblem in trying to instruct the other what the difference betweenearlier and later is? The very fact that they are communicating at all,that one is saying now this and then that, would seem to solve the problem. Even if, by the ter ms of the problem, the message must bereceived in its entirety all at once so that conversation between the twoparties over a period of time is explicitly excluded, the reading of the message, unlike the mere receiving of the message, is emphaticallynot instantaneous but must take some amount of time. W can imagine e the sender forwarding the following sort of message: Dear reader: I should like to explain to you how I am using the ter ms \" earlier \" and \" later \". The reading of this message, weboth know, takes time. W further know that events are ordered e in time. Y u can understand what I mean by \" earlier \" and o210 Beyond Experience \" later \" by reflecting on the point that as I use the ter m \" earlier \" you will have read the word \" Dear \" earlier than you will have read the word \" reader \". Y u will have read \" reader \" later than o you will have read \" Dear \". This ready solution to the temporal Ozma problem is, however, mere illusion. The argument harbors an important implicit assumptionwhich, when exposed, undermines the conclusion. T reveal this o assumption I propose to pursue the problem in a slightly altered, butequivalent, way. Let us imagine the original (spatial) version of the Ozma problem as concer ning not the instructing of a remote listener as to which isright and which left, but rather the attempt to discover, by means ofthe communication link we have described, which items on the distantplanet are incongruous counterparts or enantiomorphs of items here onEarth. The two versions of the spatial Ozma problem are equivalent inthis respect: a solution to either one would provide a means to solvethe other. As we have seen, if we knew that the intelligence withwhom we were talking on the telephone had a body spatially congru-ent to our own, i.e. was not enantiomorphic relative to us, we couldsimply tell her that her right hand was the one which was on the sameside of her body as her appendix. The solution to the rst problemprovides a means of solving the second, and (it should be obvious)conversely. In the light of this alter native description of the spatial version of the Ozma problem, we can construct a second formulation of the tem-poral Ozma problem. Under this revision we can conceive of the prob-lem, equivalently, as concer ning the attempt to infor m the receiverwhether the region in which the message originated shares a timedirection congruent with that of the receiver or whether the two re-gions are temporal enantiomorphs of one another. Stating the problem in this way, we can readily see what is wrong with the suggested solution to the temporal Ozma problem: it helpsitself gratuitously to one of the two possibilities which are to bedecided between. F r consider: if the region in which the message is o received is suffering a local time reversal, then the test forwarded byour misguided sender will have precisely the opposite effect to the oneintended. If we were to observe that strange planet directly it wouldappear to us to be running backward. Creatures would grow youngerinstead of older, golf balls would fly out of holes and stop abruptly atthe head of a putter, which is then cocked upward, etc. Similarly forSpace and Time 211 the reading of the message. Relative to our time, the receiver would \" start \" reading at what we take to be the end of the message andwould nish reading some time later with the word \" Dear \". \" Dear \"(contrary to our expectations) would be read later than \" reader \", notearlier. The analogy with the spatial Ozma problem thus emerges rather more live than the rst solution would have led us to think it might.But if this solution does not work, is there any that does? Is there anymessage conceivable, subject to the constraints given, which wouldallow the passing of decisive infor mation concer ning the relativedirections of time in the regions of the sender and of the receiver? Theoriginal spatial Ozma problem, the problem of nding out whether ourcorrespondent is like or oppositely handed, is generally acknowledgedto be insolvable short of perfor ming certain quite technical (and 32expensive) experiments in particle physics. At the level of ordinary experience, the spatial version of the Ozma problem remains insolv-able (see [26]). Is the temporal Ozma problem similarly insolvable?An argument can be given that the latter, temporal, version is alsoinsolvable. Suppose we were able to observe directly two planets which are temporal enantiomorphs of one another. (If we were to lm the his-tories of both of these planets and then run one lm backward, the scenes projected would be indistinguishable.) On one of these planets,the one in which time runs the same way as ours, we see a womanpick up an iron bar, clamp it in a vice, and studiously proceed to le aseries of notches in it. F r a while lings fall to the floor. At last she is o nished, she unclamps the bar, and places it away on a shelf where itsits for a very long time. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 32. In 1956-7 it was shown in a series of landmark experiments - which were to win a Nobel Prize for Chen Ning Y ng and Tsung Dao Lee, who had a proposed that such experiments be undertaken - that there is a fundamentalasymmetry in the manner in which certain subatomic particles decay [disin-tegrate]. Anyone, anywhere in the universe who duplicated these experiments- provided that the laws of Nature are unifor m throughout the universe -would, theoretically, then be in a position to be instructed how to apply theter ms \" right \" and \" left \" unambiguously. But to date, this seems to be the only way to solve the spatial version of the Ozma problem. Anyone operating withthe ' normal ' artifacts of everyday experience would be totally unable to solvethe problem.212 Beyond Experience As we look in on the second planet, we see a similarly notched bar sitting on a shelf. At rst all appears normal. After a while, however,strange things begin to happen. A woman walks backward into theroom, takes the bar from the shelf and clamps it in a vice. A le risesabruptly from the workbench to her waiting hand. She places the edgeof the le into one of the notches in the bar. Suddenly some lingsleap from the floor to meet the le which is abruptly drawn across thebar, welding these flying particles into the notch in the bar. And so thestory goes on. But what about the bars during these longish periods when they sit unchangingly on their shelves? If we look at one of the bars duringjust that time, we cannot tell on which of the two planets it resides. Wemust wait to see what happens on that planet . The Ozma problem asks us to imagine such a bar removed from its planet of origin, to imagineit wrenched from its surroundings with their telltale clues anddelivered naked to us. Can we tell by examining the bar on whichplanet it originated? The conclusion we are driven to is that there is no way to tell. Anything that the writer on the rst planet could havewritten could, with equal likelihood, appear verbatim in a messagefrom the second planet. W would be totally unable to assign such a e message to one planet or to its temporally reversed counterpart. Thusthe analogy between the spatial and temporal versions of the Ozmaproblem seems complete. Surprisingly, this conclusion too, just like its erstwhile opposite, follows from a defective argument and must be rejected. Let us seewhy. This latter argument, an argument for the insolvability of the prob- lem, assumes that we can transport the iron bars in question off ofeach of the two planets described. There is, of course, no problem forthe planet in which the direction of time is the same as that of Earth.W can imagine the machinist in the rst case retur ning eventually,e taking the bar down from the shelf, ensconcing it in a rocket, andlaunching the rocket heavenward. Y ars later the rocket in its aimless e flight is intercepted quite accidentally by some earthlings who, know-ing nothing of its place of origin, take its cargo home to study. But what story shall we tell for the second case? What sort of causal chain of events can deliver a bar to us from a planet where time is oppositely directed? There would seem to be a profound difcultyin there being communication, or causal interaction, between twoplanets so related. F r the second planet, the rocket-ship account oSpace and Time 213 simply will not work. F r the woman in our second story to take the o bar, place it in a rocket, and launch it off into space would for her on that planet be a case of her operating contrary to the laws of thermo- dynamics. W would expect on this second planet - since time there is e running in the reverse direction to our time - that rocket ships wouldland while sucking in flames and smoke, but not that they should liftoff spewing out flames and smoke. How then are we to get possession of the bar? It would appear that the only way for us to receive the described sort of message from aplanet whose time direction was opposite to ours would require thatthere be a violation of some causal laws on one or both of the twoplanets. So far-reaching is this point that it even requires that we retract the thought experiment which originally set the stage on which the prob-lem was to be played out. W have uncritically imagined someone e looking in on both of two planets having opposite time directions. Buteven this amount of causal interaction is in violation of causal laws.P rt of the story we tell of the process of seeing involves the emissiona of photons from objects and the subsequent impinging of these photons on our retinas. But this process is obviously directed in time.On a planet where time ran oppositely to ours, we could not see objects at all: objects would not be photon-emitters, but would bephoton-sinks (i.e. would ' suck in ' photons). In sum, the analogy ultimately flounders. The Ozma problem for spatial relations is genuine for all regions of the universe where time isdirected as it is on Earth. No causal laws need be violated for two spa-tially incongruous planets (e.g. where humanoids have their appen-dixes on the left, rather than the right, sides of their bodies) to be intemporal communication with one another. The analogous situationdoes not hold for temporally incongruous planets. F r two temporally o incongruous planets to be in communication by means of a spatiallyextended message does require the violation of causal laws on one orboth of the two planets concer ned. T ylor-type analogies between spatial and temporal relations do,a apparently, have their limits. The Ozma problem is one feature of spa-tial relations which is without counterpart among temporal relations.While we can construct an Ozma problem for spatial relations, giventhings as they stand here and now, we can construct an analogousOzma problem for temporal relations only if time ' runs backward ' insome regions of the universe.214 Beyond Experience 8.10 On the connectedness of space and the connectedness of 33time Once again, the problem derives from Kant. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues that we must conceive of space (i.e. the space of length, width, and depth) and of time as each being unied, i.e. thatthere cannot be several spaces or more than one time. ... we can represent to ourselves only one space; and if we speak of diverse spaces, we mean thereby only parts of one andthe same unique space. ... These parts cannot precede the oneall-embracing space, as being, as it were, constituents out ofwhich it can be composed; on the contrary, they can be thoughtonly as in it. Space is essentially one. ([106], A25) Different times are but parts of one and the same time. ... The innitude of time signies nothing more than that every deter-minate magnitude of time is possible only through limitationsof one single time that underlies it. ([106], A32) Kant believes that the human mind is constrained to operate in this manner, that we cannot coherently think of (actually existing) objectswhich are spatially inaccessible to one another, or of incidents in timewhich do not stand in unique positions in a single temporal con-tinuum. In effect, Kant 's claim about space is that it is a priori necessary for \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 33. This section is a revised version of \" Spatial and T mporal W rlds: Could e o There Be More Than One of Each? \" which appeared in Ratio 57, no. 2 (Dec. 1975), and in the German edition, as \" R \u00a8 umliche W lten und zeitliche a e nnte es mehr als je eine geben? \" In this present version, much of e o the original terminology has been altered to accord with that adopted in this book. I would particularly like to re-express my gratitude to Jonathan Bennett, who painstakingly read two early versions of the original paper and offeredinvaluable advice, some of which I declined on the rst occasion of publica-tion, but which I am now happy to follow. I would also like to express thanksto Raymond Bradley and the participants in the F culty and Graduate Semi- a nar at Simon Fraser University for their helpful comments. Eike-HennerKluge found an error in the original published version. I have addressed thematter he raised, and tried to correct it, in footnote 34 (p. 217) below.Space and Time 215 any two spatially extended objects to stand in some determinate spa- tial relations to one another. It is impossible for (the spatial parts of )either object not to be in some spatial direction (south, north-by-northwest, etc.) to (the spatial parts of ) the other. Similarly, his claimabout time is that it is a priori necessary for any two temporally ex-tended objects to stand in some determinate temporal relations to oneanother. It is impossible for (the temporal parts of ) either object not tobe in some temporal relation (i.e. earlier than, simultaneous with, orlater than) to (the temporal parts of ) the other. All of this is, of course,just another way of saying that space and time are each unied, thatthe regions of space are not disconnected from one another, and thatincidents in time are not disconnected from one another. Like T ylor a (see section 8.8), Kant can be seen to be arguing that there is animportant analogy between space and time. In this instance, that both can be conceived of only as being unied. Anthony Quinton has challenged Kant 's claims about this particular analogy between space and time. Quinton argues ([164]) that Kant isright about time, that time must be unied, but argues that Kant waswrong about space. He argues that space (the space of length, width,and depth) need not be unied. I think that Quinton has made a mistake. I will try to show that Kant was correct in arguing that there is an analogy between space and time in respect of connectedness. That is, I agree with Kant that if eitherspace or time is unied, then so, too, is the other. But where I differfrom Kant is in arguing that neither space nor time need be conceivedof as unied, that we can conceive of both space and time as being unconnected. In short, Kant was right in arguing that there is an anal-ogy; but he was wrong about what that analogy actually is. Quinton begins by trying to show that space need not be thought to be necessarily connected. (His rst argument needs some minorrepair, which I will make below; but on the whole it is correct.) Quin-ton then attempts to construct a parallel argument in an attempt toprove that time need not be thought to be necessarily connected, butnds he is unable to do so. From this, Quinton concludes that Kantwas right about time, that time must be unied. I will try to show thatQuinton 's second argument - for the unity of time - rests on two mis-takes, and that his conclusion is not warranted. I will try to show thattime, like space, need not be thought to be necessarily connected. Quinton approaches the problem through the now-familiar method of telling a possible-worlds tale. In an attempt to prove that two spatialregions may be totally unconnected to one another, Quinton describes216 Beyond Experience a man living in England who when he falls asleep nds himself at a lakeside in a tropical setting. His experiences at the lakeside, unlikemany dream-sequences, are as ordinary, as matter-of-fact, and asuneventful as are his everyday English experiences. Nothing dream-like, fantastic, or wildly unlikely occurs in the tropical environment.The hero passes the day in the tropics and when he falls asleep thereimmediately nds himself in England. And these English and tropicalexperiences regularly alternate. F ced with these two sets of experiences both of which are non-a dreamlike, both of which seem to be waking experiences, how do wedetermine which is dream and which is reality? Quinton lls in his talein such a way as to make the decision arbitrary and hence impossible.T the objection that the lakeside experience is not public, he lets it beo public: various other persons in England on going to sleep similarlynd themselves in the tropical setting; they meet their Englishacquaintances there ([164], 142), etc. As the details get lled in, itbecomes more and more unreasonable to say of either set of experi-ences that it is a dream and the other is genuine. Rather, from the con-trived similarity of the experiences we would want to say that they areboth genuine. They are very unlike dreams: they are not fantastic, theyare public, scientic principles work in both, etc. In a word, we wouldhave to say that Quinton 's hero inhabits two places. Having effectively argued that it is possible that a person should inhabit two places, the next step of the argument involves determiningwhether these two places must be located within the same physicalspace or not. At this point, Quinton 's argument falters a bit: \" Supposethat I am in a position to institute the most thorough geographicalinvestigations and however protractedly and carefully these arepursued they fail to reveal anywhere on earth like my lake. But couldwe not then say that it must be on some other planet? W could but it e would be gratuitous to do so. There could well be no positive reasonwhatever, beyond our fondness for the Kantian thesis, for saying thatthe lake is located somewhere in ordinary physical space and thereare, in the circumstances envisaged, good reasons for denying its loca-tion there \" ([164], 143). T be frank, I do not see what ' good reasons ' o Quinton has in mind when he says that there are good reasons fordenying that the lake is located in ordinary physical space. His asser-tions to the contrary notwithstanding, as he has described the cir-cumstances, it is perfectly possible that the lake should exist on some other planet in ' ordinary physical space '. Nevertheless his possible-worlds tale can be enhanced in such a way as to yield the results heSpace and Time 217 seeks. Rather than simply having his hero ' institute the most thorough geographical investigations ' on Earth, let us add to the tale that thehero carries out a thorough exploration of his entire spatial world. Admittedly this is a trifle hard to imagine, but it is not at all logicallyimpossible. At best it is physically* impossible. But since we are tell-ing a possible-worlds tale anyway, a tale which may depart, short oflogical inconsistency, as much as we wish from the facts of this world,there is no particular difculty in adding to the story the infor mationthat the hero completes an innite number of explorations in a nitetime. (P rhaps he has a kind of radar-like device whose signal tra-e verses space instantaneously.) In any case, we simply build it into ourtale that a complete examination of the space in which either locale is situated fails to reveal the other locale. And with this repair to his taleeffected, we can proceed to Quinton 's rst set of conclusions: thetwo places are in different spaces, i.e. are spatially unconnected, and 34Kant 's thesis that at most one space is possible is refuted. Quinton 's possible-worlds tale has one particularly odd feature which he does not comment on, but which, because it may appear toundermine his case, deserves to be made explicit and defended. It isoften claimed that a person cannot be in two places at one time. Quin- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 34. There is a residual problem: perhaps the lakeside is located not at an unconnected place in space, but is at a connected place, only it is in the futureor the past. Can we adjust for this complication? I think we can. W are given e that the marvelous radar-like device can furnish an instantaneous snapshotpicture of all of space accessible from England. Suppose, further, that theregion of space which contains England is a reasonably deterministic one inwhich extensive prediction and retrodiction* are possible. And nally sup-pose that the best scientists know enough of the laws of nature to be able toperfor m remarkably complete predictions and retrodictions. Under these cir-cumstances, scientists might be able to deduce that the region of space whichcontains England never has, and never will, contain the lakeside setting. Suchempirical evidence would indicate that the lakeside is not connected both intime and in place to England, i.e. (1) that if the space which contains Englandis unied, then the lakeside stands in a time stream outside of that of Eng-land; (2) that if time is unied, then the lakeside resides in a space uncon-nected to the space which contains England; or (3) that the lakeside is neithertemporally nor spatially connected to England. Each of these results chal-lenges at least one of the two Kantian theses. T ken altogether, they would a indicate that there are no grounds to regard either of his theses as being apriori necessary.218 Beyond Experience ton 's tale seems to run afoul of this prohibition, for the fellow he de- scribes while asleep in England is simultaneously awake in the tropi-cal setting. He would appear then to be in two places at the same 35time. But while this is true - and undeniably odd in the extreme - itdoes not, by itself, serve to undermine Quinton 's tale. F r, as he has o described the situation, with there being no causal interaction betweenthe two places, nothing untoward or incoherent follows from thehero 's being in two places at the same time. The hero 's being in twoplaces at the same time seems to work no mischief in this context andthe tale remains innocent. P rhaps the impossibility claim ought to be e tidied up to read, \" No person can be awake and in two places at the same time \", but it is not clear that even this repaired claim is true. Inany case we need not pursue it, for - as Quinton rst tells the tale -the hero is never awake in two places at the same time. Whenever heis awake in one, he is asleep in the other. Having constructed his rst possible-worlds tale in which he argues for the possibility of there being two distinct spaces, Quinton askswhether we can construct an analogous tale showing the possibility ofthere being two times. Surprisingly he argues that time, unlike space,is unitary, that there can be only one time. Quinton does not seem to realize, however, that the technique of possible-worlds storytelling is ineffectual for his purposes. Ratherthan, as in the rst tale, trying to establish the logical possibility ofa certain proposition (viz., \" There are two spatially unconnectedplaces\"), he is trying to establish the logical impossibility of a certain proposition (viz., \" There are two temporally unconnected events \"). Itsufces in the rst case simply to show that there exists some fairlyexpansive, consistent description of some possible world or other in \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 35. Remember, T ylor 's rst thesis (pp. 192ff.) states only a sufcient condi- a tion for an object 's being in two places at the same time, viz. by being spa-tially large enough to span a path between the two. But that thesis does notclaim that this is the only way for a thing to be in two places at the same time. T ylor 's thesis leaves open the possibility that a thing may exist in two placesa at the same time without occupying each point along a spatial path connect- ing the two. That Quinton 's hero is simultaneously in two different places is a corol- lary of his second thesis, to wit, that there cannot be more than one time.When we get to that discussion, in a moment, I will argue against the proprie-ty of Quinton 's using that description of his hero. But for the moment, it doesno damage to accept it.Space and Time 219 which the proposition in question (\" There are two spatially uncon- nected places \") occurs. But to show, as Quinton wishes, in the secondcase, that some given proposition is logically impossible, it is insuf- cient to author one tale in which the proposition (\" There are two temporally unconnected events \") occurs and to show that that taleis logically inconsistent. Rather, in order to prove the proposition to belogically impossible, Quinton must show that any tale whatever whichincludes the proposition under survey would be logically inconsistent. The method of possible-worlds storytelling is well-suited for show- ing that certain propositions (of the for m \" There is an x such that x is y \") are logically possible. All one must do is to nd one such story in which the claim occurs and which is free of self-contradiction. But themethod is ineffectual when it comes to proving the negation, i.e. whenit comes to proving the impossibility of propositions of that for m. F r o now the job becomes, not one of showing that some one story which includes the proposition is free of inconsistency, but rather that every story which includes the proposition is self-inconsistent. What thelatter really amounts to is not storytelling at all, but rather explainingwhy it is impossible to tell a self-consistent possible-worlds tale inwhich the proposition at issue is included. But this is not what Quinton undertakes. Instead, he proceeds as he did in the rst instance. He attempts to tell a possible-worlds tale inwhich the claim that there are two temporally unconnected eventsoccurs; he argues that this latter story entails a contradiction; and con-cludes that it is impossible that there should be two temporally uncon-nected events. Just from considerations of methodology alone we canargue that he has failed to establish his negative thesis. Finding onecase in which the supposition that there are two temporally uncon-nected events leads to an inconsistency does nothing to establish the impossibility of there being temporally unconnected events. Hisapproach to the question can yield only inconclusive results. Themethod of possible-worlds storytelling cannot establish the negativeresults he desires. But questions of methodology aside, Quinton commits a second error. There is an internal flaw in the latter possible-worlds tale hetells. Even though, were it successful in entailing an inconsistency, itwould still be insufcient to justify his negative thesis, I will try toshow that it fails at the more limited task of entailing an inconsistency.F r Quinton 's latter tale, when shor n of a question-begging assump-o tion, in fact demonstrates precisely what Quinton is trying to deny,viz. that it is logically possible that there should be two temporally220 Beyond Experience unconnected events. Quinton produces two arguments ([164], 145 and 146) to show that every lakeside event can be dated in England. I willexamine only his rst argument. (I think the flaw is virtually identicalin both cases.) He asks us to imagine that the fellow who is alternately in England and in the tropics cannot remember whether lakeside events occurredearlier or later than the events he remembers in England. But, saysQuinton (switching again into a rst-person narrative): \" The troublewith this obstacle to unitary dating is that it is too easily circumvented.At the beginning of day 1 in England I write down in order all thelakeside events I can remember. On day 2 in England I cannot remem-ber whether the events of day 1 follow or preceded the lakeside eventsin the list. But the list will be there to settle the matter and I can, ofcourse, remember when I compiled it \" ([164], 145). The error here issubtle. Quinton argues that unitary dating (i.e. the intercalating) ofevents in the two sequences can be obtained by the simple expedientof daily writing down in one sequence the events one remembers fromthe other. I agree that this device will work, provided one is writingdown one 's memories . But how, in a non-question-begging way, is this matter to be decided? How does Quinton 's hero know that he iswriting down memories (of past events) and not, for example, precog-nitions (of future events)? Let it be granted that each time the hero ofthe tale awakes in England he knows one day 's worth (or twelve hours ' worth or whatever) more infor mation about the lakeside events.I am not calling into question that his writing down of his experiencesis the chronicling of genuine occurrences and that he can be said toknow that such-and-such events truly are incidents occurring at thelakeside. What I am challenging is his right to describe this knowl-edge, these daily cognitions in England, as memory. What criteria need be satised to entitle us to say of a cognition that it is a case of memory? Are these criteria satised or even satisablein the case under examination? In order to see what is involved inmaking the decision between memory and other modes of cognition,let us ask ourselves how we make the decision in the ordinary case, inour normal, ordinary series of wakeful experiences. F r convenience ' o sake, let us for the moment restrict our attention to a single alter nativemode of cognition: precognition. Precognition (foreknowledge orprescience), if it occurs at all, occurs so rarely that we need hardlyever trouble ourselves over the matter of distinguishing it from mem-ory. But if it did occur more often and we did have to distinguish itfrom memory, we could not do so on any intrinsic feature of the expe-Space and Time 221 rience itself or on any introspective basis. No mental phenomena carry with them an identifying mark of memoryhood. Some of the things wethink we recall never happened at all, yet introspectively thesethoughts (images, beliefs) are indistinguishable from genuine memo-ries. Merely being memorable or, more exactly, having the felt qualityof a memory is no guarantee of the truth of that which has that quality.Our mental faculties can be faulty or deceived. W can believe that we e remember events and it tur ns out that these events did not occur, andsimilarly we can fail to remember events that did occur. That athought or mental image is really of a past occurrence and not perhapsa precognition of a future one is guaranteed by nothing in the thoughtor the image itself. The manner in which memories and precognitionspresent themselves to consciousness seems to be all of a piece. Tolear n that a memory-like thought is really a memory and not a precog-nition we must depend ultimately on objective criteria and moreexactly on physical criteria. Generally we do not have to depend on physical criteria, for we quickly come to lear n by experience that in virtually all cases whenwe have memory-like experiences we are having genuine memories.But if precognition were a common occurrence we would then have torely not on this (just mentioned) statistical generalization but on the' testimony ' of singular physical facts. W can understand that, under e these latter circumstances, we would have to ask ourselves, \" Look,self, I seem to recall writing a contract with Jones. Am I rememberingor precognizing? \" It would do little good to attempt to secure the cor-roborative testimony of another person, Jones himself for example, forhe would presumably have precisely the same quandary. The answerto the question whether I (or we) are remembering or precognizing isdecidable only by looking to see whether the contract exists now. If itdoes, we are remembering; if it does not, we are precognizing. Ulti-mately, if the question of deciding between memory and precognitionseriously arises for a group of persons all of whom share the samecognition, then it is answerable only by the testimony of physical facts. If we lived in a world where precognizing was as common as remembering, then Quinton 's argument would be all-too-obviouslyquestion-begging. But even if it is not obviously question-begging, it is question-begging nevertheless. W need only raise the question of e the possibility of precognizing as an alter native description of whatQuinton 's hero is doing, to see that the question is unanswerable in histale. What right, we should want to know, does Quinton 's hero have to222 Beyond Experience assume that he is remembering rather than precognizing? The answer: None. In a world where precognizing is an acknowledged possibility,even the corroboration of others who shared similar lakeside experi-ences would be inadequate to decide between a case of memory andone of precognition. If England and the tropical lakeside were spatially and temporally connected, we could appeal to physical records, to the causally linkedremnants of past events - photographs, memoranda, bur nt embers,contracts, and the like - to settle whether the ' memories ' one has inEngland of the lakeside were genuine memories or precognitions. If a man could pass through P radise in a dream, and have a a flower presented to him ... and if he found that flower in hishand when he awoke - A e! and what then? (Samuel T ylor ya Coleridge [50], 282) But Quinton 's tale of the two spatially unconnected places is so con- structed as to preclude the very possibility of there being physicalrecords shared in the two worlds ([164], 143). There are no physicalobjects common both to England and to the lakeside environment.There are no clocks, starscapes, written memoranda, or even rocksthat occur in both worlds. But what about persons ' bodies? Cannot the required records be made on them? Suppose Quinton 's hero were to write down on hisown skin a diary of events as they occurred in the tropics. W uldn 't o the hero then know, when in England, that the events recorded on hisskin happened earlier? Since causes always precede their effects, the requisite proof would seem literally to be in hand. This latter repair will not do. F r as Quinton tells the tale, his hero o does not have one body in two places or even one body now inEngland and later in the tropics: his hero has (or inhabits) two 36bodies. The English body (we can guess) is a pallid white wracked with chilblains; the tropical body is a sunbathed bronze infused withrobust good health. The English body does not become tanned, andthe tropical body does not grow pale. The ' linkage ' between the two worlds is experiential, not physical; \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 36. Later, in chapter 12, I will argue (as does Quinton in his The Nature of Things, [165], 95-6, 99-102), that it is logically possible that a person should serially inhabit any number of different bodies.Space and Time 223 persons reside in both worlds but not physical objects. And the testi- mony of persons in the absence of corroborating physical evidence isindecisive in the matter of deciding between memory and precogni-tion. Quinton 's ' traveler ' is not entitled to describe his cognitions inEngland of his lakeside experiences as being memories. That theymerely ' feel like ' memories is simply not good enough evidence inthe face of a serious challenge to the claim that they are memories.Thus, we must give a different description of the hero 's memory-likethoughts. But what description? Having gone to some trouble to expose one question-begging way of telling the possible-worlds tale, we must be especially careful not tofall into the trap of replacing it with another. It would be all too easyto argue that since we are not entitled to say that the hero remembersthe lakeside events, we must say instead that he either remembers,simultaneously cognizes, or precognizes those events. In effect, wereplace a single description (viz. \" remembers \") with three seeminglyexhaustive possibilities (viz. \" remembers or simultaneously cognizesor precognizes \"). But to make the claim that these three alter nativesexhaust the possibilities is just to presuppose the truth of precisely what is in question, namely, the Kantian hypothesis that all events aretemporally related to one another. If we are to avoid prejudicing ourtale a second time, we must take care to drive a non-Kantian wedge atthis point. W must, at the very least, seriously entertain a fourth pos- e sibility, to wit, the possibility that our traveler, upon awakening inEngland, genuinely cognizes lakeside experiences, but the lakesideexperiences themselves are neither earlier than, simultaneous with, norfuture to the time of cognizing them in England. T say of something that it is a memory logically guarantees that ito is true of a past event. If the hero of Quinton 's tale when in Englandwere able to identify his seeming memories as genuine memories,then Quinton 's and Kant 's claim that all temporal events may be or-ganized into a single temporal sequence would be reinforced. But thisis precisely what is impossible in Quinton 's own tale. There is no waywhatsoever in Quinton 's tale for the hero to ascertain what the statusis of his seeming memories of the lakeside. There is nothing what-soever to indicate whether they are memories, simultaneous cogni-tions, precognitions, or - even more drastically - none of these. Inshort, contrary to Quinton 's own conclusion, the events of the lakesidecannot be intercalated with those of England. It would seem, then, that there is no reason whatever to persist with the Kantian thesis that timemust be unitary and that such a property of time is known a priori.224 Beyond Experience Space and time may in fact be unied. But if they are, then - con- trary to Kant - this is no a priori truth. W are not constrained to think e of all regions of space as being connected and all events in time asbeing connected. This conclusion holds not just for the space and timeof physics or natural science. What I have tried to show is that it ispossible that the space and time of human experience may haveunconnected elements. With some imagination, we can describe pos-sible experiences which, if they were to occur, would warrant our in-sisting that experiential space and time are not unied. 8.11 Time travelOne kind of time travel is so common, so familiar, that it is rarely ever recognized for what it is. All of us - except those at death 's door -have an ability to travel forward in time. All we have to do is wait.W iting is the simplest and most direct for m of time travel. Mosta parents know this intuitively, although perhaps without ever havingrealized that they do. When youngsters, lled with the anticipation of 37a birthday party, say impatiently, \" I wish it was tomorrow \", theirparents will often counsel them by saying, \" Just wait; it will be. \" But waiting has two drawbacks. First, it is strictly forward-directed: one can travel into the future by waiting, but not into the past. More-over, there does not seem to be any analogous ' operation ' which willtake us backward in time. There is no such thing as ' reverse-waiting 'or ' unwaiting '. The second drawback to waiting as a mode of timetravel is that it proceeds in lockstep with the ticking of the clock. Toget from noon today to noon tomorrow takes twenty-four hours ofwaiting. What persons who are seeking ' better ' methods of movingabout in time clearly want is a way of getting from noon today to noontomorrow without having to spend twenty-four hours in the process. Aminute or two of traveling time is far more attractive to them. T ylor has shown us one way of traveling forward and backward in a time. Objects which are curved in space can, as we have seen, perfor mthe temporal equivalent of objects moving back and forth in space (seepp. 200-3). But that is of scant use to the person wanting unlimitedcapacity for time travel. By bending my body into a -shape - head and toes forward, hips to the rear (i.e. similar to that of the object pic-tured in Figure 8.4, p. 202) - and by moving forward at 1 m / sec, then \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 37. The subjunctive mood seems to have disappeared among today 's youth.Space and Time 225 along a certain path my toes will travel backward in time from my hips by a fraction of a second. But I cannot use T ylor 's method to a transport my present body from now to yesterday, still less to the year1750. The concept of moving forward or backward in time by great leaps is intelligible. Suppose it takes me eight hours to digest a meal andsuppose that in one day my hair grows 0.06 cm. Now suppose that Iam placed into a ' time machine '. I sit in the machine for the time ittakes me to digest the meal I just ate. In this same time my hair grows0.02 cm. In short, my body has aged eight hours. But suppose whenI step out of the machine it is one year later (or earlier) than when Istepped into the machine. This would be a case of the sort of timetravel which is depicted in countless science-ction writings. W will e call this ' accelerated ' time travel. Is accelerated time travel possible? F rward-directed accelerated o time travel is certainly logically possible. It may even be physicallypossible. Indeed the technology may be imminent. If cryogenic freez-ing (low-temperature ' suspended animation ') can be realized forhuman beings, it would certainly qualify as forward time travel. Wealready possess the technology to forward accelerate in time certaincreatures (e.g. the sh Dallia pectoralis [145], 19), which can be fro- zen alive and subsequently thawed and revived with little or no per- 38manent damage. But the real problem has always been with the notion of backward- directed time travel. Is accelerated backward time travel physicallypossible? There is a certain amount of empirical evidence that it is not.The best of this evidence is simply the fact that, so far as we can tell,no one has traveled to the here and now from any time or place in thefuture. Of course such evidence is not conclusive: it may be that futuregenerations will have destroyed themselves in a war or environmentaldisaster; or it may be that they will have enacted legislation with suf-ciently severe sanctions and policing to prevent time travel to our cen-tury; etc. Nonetheless, the very fact that there are no visitors here andnow from the future strongly suggests that at no time in the future willa means be found to permit traveling backward in time. And the factthat it will never be done in tur n suggests that it is physically impos-sible. But even if backward time travel were to be physically impossible, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 38. F r a bibliography on ' freeze tolerance ' see [198], 79-84.o226 Beyond Experience might it still be logically possible? Even if this world is of such a sort that traveling backward in time cannot be realized, might there beother possible worlds where traveling backward in time does occur? Many persons have thought that traveling backward in time is logi- cally impossible. Their arguments typically are of this sort: \" If youcould travel backward in time, then you could encounter yourselfwhen you were a youngster. Even if you are not normally homicidallyinclined, it is at least theoretically possible that you kill that youngster.But if you did, then you would not have grown up to have reached theage when you traveled back in time. Thus there would be a contradic-tion: you both would and would not have traveled backward in time.Since the story involves a contradiction, it is logically impossible totravel backward in time. \" Such arguments have been around for years.They are especially tricky because they involve what are calledmodal* concepts, in particular the notions of possibility and impos- sibility. Does the very concept of travel into the past entail contradic- tions? Does the possibility of murdering yourself as a child show thatbackward-directed time travel is an impossibility? The answer is: there is no possibility, if you travel into the past, of murdering yourself as a child. The very fact that you are here nowlogically guarantees that no one - neither you nor anyone else - mur- dered you as a child, for there is no possibility of changing the past. This notion that one cannot change the past needs careful attention. There is nothing special about the past in this particular regard. F r o you can no more change the past than you can change the present orchange the future. And yet this is not fatalism. I am not arguing thatour deliberations and actions are futile. I cannot change the future - by anything I have done, am doing, or will do - from what it is going to be. But I can change the future fromwhat it might have been. I may carefully consider the appearance ofmy garden, and after a bit of thought, mulling over a few alter natives,I decide to cut down the apple tree. By so doing, I change the futurefrom what it might have been. But I do not change it from what it willbe. Indeed, by my doing what I do, I - in small measure - contributeto making the future the very way it will be. Similarly, I cannot change the present from the way it is. I can only change the present from the way it might have been, from the way itwould have been were I not doing what I am doing right now. Andnally, I cannot change the past from the way it was. In the past, Ichanged it from what it might have been, from what it would havebeen had I not done what I did.Space and Time 227 W can change the world from what it might have been; but ine doing that we contribute to making the world the way it was, is, and will be. W cannot - on pain of logical contradiction - change thee world from the way it was, is, and will be. The application of these logical principles for time travel becomes clear. If one travels into the past, then one does not change the past;one does in the past only what in fact happened. If you are alive today,having grown up in the preceding years, then you were not murdered.If, then, you or anyone else travels into the past, then that time travelersimply does not murder you. What does that time traveler do in the past? From our perspective, looking backward in time, that travelerdoes whatever in fact happened, and that - since you are alive today -does not include murdering you. Time travel into the past involves no intrinsic contradiction. The appearance of contradiction arises only if one illicitly hypothesizesthat the time traveler can change the past from what it was. But thatsort of contradiction has nothing whatever to do with time travel perse. One would encounter the same sort of contradiction if one were tohypothesize that someone now were to change the present from theway it is or someone in the future were to change the future from theway it will be. All these latter notions are logically impossible. But none of them is intrinsic to the concept of time travel. One should take care in describing time travelers not to give them logically impossible capabilities, e.g. the capacity to change the pastfrom the way it was, the present from the way it is, or the future fromthe way it will be. But once one has done that, then there is no need tothink the concept of time travel to be logically impossible. It just tur nsout to be a contingent fact about this actual world that acceleratedbackward travel in time does not occur.C H A P T E R N I N E Properties 9.1 The one and the many Certain philosophical questions arise on their own quite naturally. Few persons have to be prompted to ask such questions as \" Are theresouls? \", \" Is there a God? \", \" What is the basis of good and evil? \", or\" Why do ethical and moral values seem to change from culture to cul-ture and from time to time? \" Other philosophical questions areslightly more remote, and occur to some, but not nearly as many, per-sons. A few of these we have already mentioned, e.g. \" Is there anedge to space? \" and \" Are persons distinct from human bodies? \" Butsome other philosophical questions are so recherch \u00b4 as to be distinctly e ' philosopher 's questions '. They are the sorts which occur naturally tovery few persons. They are the sorts of questions which one must beinduced, under provocation or tutelage, to come to see as posinggenuine problems worthy of pursuit and whose answers are both sub-tle and central. One of these latter problems is the problem of ' the oneand the many ' introduced, virtually at the dawn of the philosophicenterprise, by Plato (427?-347 B C). Plato asked a deceptively simple question: How is it possible for there to be two or more things of the same sort? How, for example, isit possible for there to be two ' identical ' clay vases? At one level, the answer might simply be: there are two identical clay vases because one is a good copy (replica) of the other. Or, wemight say: there are two identical clay vases because they were bothcast from the same mold. But Plato 's original question was not thekind of question to which these latter would be proper answers.Plato 's question was intended to go much deeper. It is not about anytwo (or three, or more) examples we might care to single out; hisquestion is one of overarching generality: How is it possible for thereto be more than one thing of any kind whatsoever, regardless whatProperties 229 kinds of things (vases, persons, clouds, mountains, etc.) there are? In short, what sort of theory must we propose to explain multiplicity itsel f in the world? Why is the very occurrence of multiplicity (in Plato 's terminology, ' the many ') thought to be a problem? Let us see. P rfor m the following thought-experiment. Imagine any two things,e e.g. two vases or two pens or two apples. Now imagine them perfectly alike: they have the same weight, same physical dimensions, same color, same temperature, same texture, same physical constitution, etc.etc. It is not just that they have no perceivable or detectable difference,something that might reveal itself to your eye or to your measuringinstruments; you are being asked to imagine that the similarity goesbeyond undetectable difference to there being absolutely no differencewhatsoever. If you have trouble stretching your imagination in thisway in regard to ordinary material objects, imagine some of the morearcane products of science, e.g. microscopic perfect crystals whichreally do seem to exhibit the perfect sameness just posited, or a D N A molecule which replicates itself with no mutation. The problem cannow be put: What accounts for the difference , the very fact that there are two or more of these things, when by hypothesis everything that is true of one - e.g. its being red, or its having a mass of 15.65 g, or itsbeing made up of a number of specic atoms in some determinate spa-tial conguration - is likewise true of its mate? In short, whataccounts for sheer difference, given identity of features? Moder n philosophers use a technical vocabulary to frame these questions and to discuss possible solutions. Things which share alltheir features in common, e.g. the perfectly similar vases, apples,cloned D N A molecules, which we have just described, are said to be qualitatively identical . They are identical, that is, in sharing one another 's properties in common. Obviously every one thing is qualitatively identical to itself, in just the same manner as, for example, every woman is as tall as herself.But while every thing is qualitatively identical to itself, only somethings are qualitatively identical to other things. The hand calculatorsitting on my desk right now is (to the best of my knowledge) notqualitatively identical to any other calculator in existence. The uniquedamage to one cor ner of its case, having been caused by its gettingcaught in the drawer in my desk, accounts for the difference. The factthat no other calculator, however similar otherwise, bears precisely thesame sort of physical damage to its own upper-right-hand cor ner230 Beyond Experience assures that my calculator is qualitatively distinct from every other thing in the world. (Chipped plastic cases are as unique as nger-prints.) This very calculator, the one with the damage to its cor ner, which is qualitatively distinct from every other thing in the world, is neverthe-less numerically identical with the calculator which is positioned on my desk next to the telephone. That is to say, my calculator with thechipped case just is the selfsame, or very same, calculator that is posi- tioned next to my telephone. When one speaks of numerical identity, one is speaking of a single thing. The single thing being spoken of isboth the calculator having the damaged case and is (at one and the same time) the very thing which is positioned next to the telephone onmy desk. It is obvious, then, that certain logical relationships hold between the concepts of qualitative identity and numerical identity . These relationships may be stated in three axioms (theses or principles): 1. Each and every thing is qualitatively identical to itself. 2. Each and every thing is numerically identical to itself. 13. Whatever are numerically identical are qualitatively identical. Figure 9.1 It is somewhat barbarous, and indeed even somewhat logically mis- leading, to talk of two things being numerically identical. The veryconcept of numerical identity implies singularity of reference. To avoid such clumsiness, and indeed literal incoherence, philosopherstypically take recourse to using variables, e.g. \" x \" and \" y \", in talking of qualitative and numerical identity so as not to give the mistakenimpression that they are presupposing that they are talking of exactlyone or two things. W are already familiar with the use of variables in e algebra, where difference in iconography, the visual appearance ofsymbol, does not invariably mean that the things referred to also aredifferent. Consider, for example, the relatively trivial pair of equa-tions: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. This third axiom will be rened in chapter 11.Properties 231 x + y = 14 x \u00d7 y = 49 The only values which satisfy both these equations simultaneously (i.e. together) are x = 7 and y = 7. Although the two symbols, \" x \" and \" y \", certainly differ, that difference does not carry over to a difference in the things referred to. Both symbols, in spite of their difference,refer to one and the same thing, viz. the number seven. When, then,philosophers use variables, e.g. \" x \" and \" y \", in stating theses about qualitative and numerical identity, their use of different symbols ex-plicitly leaves it as a wholly open question whether one or more thingsis being referred to. That is, difference of symbols does not sufce toimply difference of referent. Using variables, the theses, or principles, stated a moment ago can be restated somewhat more perspicuously. W will also introduce a bit e more symbolism. - Numerical identity will be symbolized with the familiar equals-sign, \" = \". - Qualitative identity will be symbolized by \" Q \". - The relation of implies will be symbolized by \" \". - The so-called quantier , e.g. \" for any x \", will be symbolized as the prex \" ( x) \". Thus in gure 9.2 ( p. 232), we get the symbolic renderings of the principles of gure 9.1 above. The third of these principles (in gure 9.2) bears the name \" The 2indiscernibility of identicals. \" It is one of the few undisputed theses 3of metaphysics. After all, it says nothing more startling than that each \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. The name was coined by Quine ([162], 139). The ter m \" indiscernible \" is principally one of psychology: there it refers to what we cannot perceive to be different. But as used here, in these metaphysical principles, the ter m isintended in a stronger sense, viz. it is to be taken to mean \" indiscernible in principle \", i.e. to mean that there is no difference at all in properties, not just that there are no perceivable differences. \" Indiscernible \" in metaphysics isthus a synonym for \" qualitative identity \". 3. An apparent exception may be found in the writings of Alfred Korzybski (see above footnote 13, p. 166). On the face of it, Korzybski seems to denythe very possibility of numerical identity: \" a principle or a premise that232 Beyond Experience 1. Each and every thing is qualitatively identical to itself. ( F r any x, x is qualitatively identical to itself.) o (x)( x Q x ) 2. Each and every thing is numerically identical to itself. ( F r any x, x is numerically identical to itself.) o (x)( x = x ) 3. Whatever are numerically identical are qualitatively identical. ( F r any x and for any y, x 's being numerically identical to y o implies that x is qualitatively identical to y.) (x)( y)( x = y x Q y ) Figure 9.2 single thing shares with itself whatever properties it happens to have. F r more controversial and far more problematic, however, is thea converse thesis which was originally introduced by Leibniz. This lat-ter principle conveniently bears the converse name, viz., \" The identityof indiscernibles \", and it says that if any x and any y share all their features or properties in common, then there is but one thing, i.e. thenx and y are not two objects, but are the selfsame object. In symbols, this latter, fourth, principle may be stated this way: (x)( y)( x Q y x = y ) Immediately, this latter principle seems to be in direct conflict with the result of our thought-experiment of a moment ago. W had posed e \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ' everything is identical with itself ' is invariably false to facts \" ([114], 194). But his ensuing explanation suggests that he is not denying the principle ofthe indiscernibility of identicals, indeed is not even discussing that principle.He is, rather, calling attention - in a somewhat misleading manner - to histheses that all things change over time (194) and that no two persons react toany one thing in precisely the same way (194-5). Neither of these latter twoclaims, whether true or false, contradicts the principle of the indiscernibilityof identicals. (W will devote the whole of chapter 11 to an examination of e the problem of change over time.)Properties 233 ourselves the task of trying to imagine two numerically distinct, qualitatively identical objects: two apples; two vases; even a D N A molecule and its perfect clone. But if this latest principle of the iden-tity of indiscernibles were to be accepted as true, if, that is, indiscer-nibility (i.e. qualitative identity) were conceded to confer numericalidentity, then the results of our thought-experiment ought to have beenat least mistaken if not outrightly impossible. Obviously, this relationship between qualitative identity and numerical identity requires closer examination. Plato certainly be-lieved that qualitative identity was possible without numerical iden-tity, that it is possible, for example, for two or more things to share alltheir properties in common. But if two things really do share all their properties in common, what, then, could possibly account for therebeing two of them? How is it possible for there to be multiplicity with- out qualitative difference? Leibniz himself thought that there could not be two numerically dis- tinct but qualitatively identical things. But he believed that this impos-sibility flowed, not from logic, not from metaphysical principles, butfrom the perfection of God. Leibniz acknowledged that there was nological bar to there being qualitatively identical, but numerically dis- tinct, objects. If such existed, however, there would seem to be acurious redundancy, a gross imperfection, in Nature. And thus Leibnizhypothesized that the reason there are no such actual oddities inNature is because Nature is the handiwork of God and God is perfect.God, he argued, could have ' no sufcient reason ' for introducing aredundancy into the world. If He made two of the same things, thenthat would be evidence that He had not ' got it right ' the rst time: anunacceptable imperfection in a P rfect Being ([5], Third paper, \u00a7\u00a75, e 13, and 19). In short, even though it is logically possible that therecould be numerically distinct, but qualitatively identical, things, theirexistence would be a blot on God 's perfection and hence Leibnizsteadfastly believed that no such things in fact existed. So sure was heof this latter conclusion that he ridiculed an acquaintance who actuallytried, empirically, to nd two qualitatively identical fallen leaves inthe autumn garden ([5], F urth paper, \u00a74). Without venturing out- o doors, Leibniz was convinced of the folly of the exercise. Virtually no philosopher since Leibniz has given any credence to Leibniz 's ' theological solution ' to the puzzle about how qualitativeidentity does not automatically confer numerical identity. Better theo-ries are needed to explain the real possibility, indeed the actuality, ofthe numerical difference of qualitatively identical things.234 Beyond Experience The solution to the puzzle about the exact nature of the relationship between qualitative identity and numerical identity tur ns on the degreeof inclusiveness, or the compass, we are to understand when wedescribe qualitative identity as the sharing of all properties in com- mon. What are the properties we are here talking about? What are the properties which make up a thing? F r example, is my being bor n o several years after Bertrand Russell a property of mine? Is it one of Russell 's? If the calculator on my desk happens to have been the234,921st one to roll off the assembly line, is that one of its proper- ties? If a distant relative, totally unknown to me, happens to die and leave me a fortune which his lawyer steals without ever havinginfor med me of the inheritance, do I have the property of being a legatee, although I am in total ignorance of the situation? Might wewant to make a distinction between intrinsic (or real) properties andextrinsic (or accidental) properties? If so, what might such a distinc-tion amount to? Such examples, and the questions they raise, show that the very notion itself of having a property is not pre-analytically precise. W have an unrened concept which serves admirably for ordinarye purposes, but it is not sophisticated enough to guide us through thesecurrent perplexities. T advance, we shall have to examine, in con- o siderably more detail, just what the concept of having a property amounts to. 9.2 Cataloguing properties and relationsSo central is the concept of property not only to our doing of philoso- phy, but to our very ability to communicate in language one withanother, that it itself has been the object of much research andspeculation. Just reflect for a moment on how very much of our ordi-nary conversation, the news we hear, and the instructions we aregiven, consists of someone 's picking out a subject and then proceed-ing to specify one or more of its properties: \" The toast is bur ned \";\" Sylvia is at the door \"; \" The Free Trade bill was given third reading 3in P rliament today \"; \" Y u can thin the shellac by adding 50 cm ofa o denatured alcohol \"; \" D N A is a helical molecule \"; etc. There is no one way, nor probably even just a few, to catalogue properties. One might, for certain purposes, want to classify propertiesaccording to whether their presence in physical objects is detectableby direct sensory experience. F r example, we might want to contrast oProperties 235 such readily observable properties as size, shape, weight, and color with more remote properties of the sort detectable only with scienticinstruments, e.g. electrical resistance, conductivity, inductance, atomicnumber, and magnetic permeability, to name just a few. Or, again, wemight want to classify properties according to whether they are rela-tively familiar (e.g. toothache, worry, fear) or whether they are com-prehensible only in light of a sophisticated theory (e.g. capital, deben-ture, cash flow, psychosis, superego, male bonding, disfellowship). F r the purposes of doing philosophy, certain ways of cataloguingo properties have proved useful for shedding light on some philosophi-cal problems. No one way of cataloguing properties can be regardedas denitive. The following catalogue is devised, then, with an eye onits eventual use in philosophy. It is in no sense the only, or the ' best ',way to classify properties. What warrants its introduction here is theuse to which it will subsequently be put. 9.2.1 Primary versus secondary properties One of the most fundamental notions many persons operate with is that some properties (features) of things are ' out there ', in the world,as they say, while others are ' in us ', in our minds, they might put it.F r example, some persons are wont to subscribe to the dictumo \" Beauty is in the eye of the beholder \", by which they mean that the' external ' physical world is not literally beautiful or ugly; it is, in thenal analysis, merely a display of shapes, noises, and colors, and anybeauty or ugliness associated with the scene is literally located withinus. Beauty or ugliness - on this account - is our individual (or in somecases, perhaps, our collective) way of reacting to certain external stimuli. P rsons who adopt the sort of dichotomy between what is ' oute there ' (the stimulus) and what it causes in us (the response) are, know-ingly or not, operating with a pair of distinctions, if not originally dueto, then at least actively promoted by, John Locke. Locke believed thatthe external physical world, the world, that is, outside our minds, ispopulated (furnished) with objects having very few properties indeed([124], book I I, chap. V I I I, \u00a7\u00a77-26). These external objects have but ve properties. Locke was, one must recall, operating with seven-teenth-century physics which knew nothing of moder n atomic phys-ics, electricity, magnetism, chemistry, and biology. These ve prop-erties he called \"primary properties\". They comprised: (1) extension236 Beyond Experience (i.e. the object 's taking up space); (2) gure (roughly, its shape); 4(3) motion or rest; (4) number; and (5) solidity (or impenetrability). T gether these primary properties had the ' power ' to cause in us not o 5only perceptions (' ideas ' he called them) of shape, motion, etc., but as well perceptions of color, sound, war mth or cold, odor, etc. Theselatter perceptions which did not ' correspond ' to the primary propertiesof material objects were said to be of ' secondary ' qualities. I think it safe to say that most persons, particularly those who are products of W ster n culture, habitually vacillate between two incom- e patible theories of perception. If not pressured by odd cases, many ofus go about our lives believing that the things we see really do havethe properties they appear to have: the wall is yellow; the piano is darkbrown; and the apple is red. But if someone reminds us that the yel-lowness of the wall, the brownness of the piano, and the redness of theapple cannot be seen when the illumination is extinguished, and yetnothing much seems to have happened to the wall, the piano, or theapple themselves, many of us will immediately switch to a Lockean-type theory and will then be inclined to place the color of theseobjects, not in the things themselves, but in our reaction to them. Wemay, under these latter circumstances, nd ourselves saying: \" The yel-lowness of the wall is my way of reacting to some physical feature ofthe wall. When the wall is illuminated, it gives off electromagneticradiation (visible light) which is focused on the retina of my eye,which in tur n causes a signal to pass along the optic nerve to mybrain. And by some process, not yet understood, it eventuates in myseeing yellow. According to this scientic explanation, then, yellow-ness is not a property of the wall, but a property of my mind (brain?).What property the wall actually has is the physical ' power ' to cause in me (and in the rest of us) a certain kind of reaction. \" I am sure that this latter sort of response is familiar to nearly every reader. It is virtually an icon of moder n science. But it is also, perhapsvery much less obviously, more a product of metaphysics. It is, afterall, not the sort of theory which is even amenable to laboratory testing.It is, rather, a philosophical edice mounted upon certain scientic \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. Sometimes Locke added another to this list: texture. (See, for example, [124], book I I, chap. V I I I, \u00a7\u00a710 and 14.) 5. The word \" ideas \" in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophy was more multipurpose than it is today. Then it was used to refer not only tobeliefs but to perceptions and memories as well.Properties 237 data in an attempt to explain, to make sense of, that data. It is no product of experience, but clearly goes beyond experience. At rst it may seem that the Lockean theory cannot be of the latter metaphysical sort. It might be supposed, as I think it often mistakenlyis, to be a straightforwardly scientic theory whose credentials havebeen so well established in the psycho-physiologist 's laboratory as tobe beyond reasonable doubt. But the situation is not at all so simple.Our sensations of secondary properties are supposed, on this theory, tobe caused by primary ones. But all of the data ' furnished ' to our minds, whether of alleged primary or secondary qualities in the thingsthemselves, tur n out - on such a theory - to be secondary, caused by,but once-removed from, as it were, the primary properties of thingsout there in the world external to our minds. W have no direct access, e except through the mediation of our senses, to the external worlditself. W can no more sense directly in things themselves the powere which causes in us perceptions of length or of solidity (supposed pri-mary properties) than we can sense in things the power which causesin us, for example, feelings of war mth, images of color, or episodes ofmusical tones (supposed secondary properties). But if so, if in prin-ciple there is no direct access - save through their effects - of theprimary properties of external objects, how can we know that suchthings really exist and how can we know anything of their ' real 'nature? Locke thought that the relationship between, on the one hand,our perceptions of primary properties and, on the other, the primaryproperties themselves was that of resemblance, while our perceptionsof secondary properties bore no resemblances to anything ' in ' materi-al objects themselves ([124], book I I, chap. V I I I, \u00a715). But this belief is at the very least unprovable. There is certainly no conceivable ex-periment which could ever show that our perceptions of primary prop-erties ' resemble ' real properties in material objects and that our per-ceptions of secondary qualities do not. Locke 's theory soon encountered still worse problems at the hands of Bishop George Berkeley. Locke 's theory, which was motivated toaccommodate the burgeoning empiricist movement in the new scienceof the day, ironically was to furnish the groundwork for Berkeley 'stheory that there was no good evidence of any external, or material,world whatsoever ([27]). It is easy to see how the seed of such a radi-cally opposing theory lay within Locke 's theory. There was no con-vincing way, or suggestion of a mechanism, within Locke 's theory tobridge the gulf between the knowledge of the contents of one 's ownmind and the supposed correspondence of these contents with some-238 Beyond Experience thing external to one 's mind, i.e. a physical, material world independ- ent of mind. Berkeley took the audacious leap of pressing the seven-teenth-century version of empiricism to its limits and thus - paradoxi-cally - coming to deny what had up until then seemed to be a bedrockof empiricism. Berkeley insisted that only what is perceived can beregarded as proven to exist. Such a dictum might be thought to be nec-essary to the pursuit of an objective science. Mere opinion and flightsof fancy are to be banished. No more would one invoke such unem-pirical, untestable existents as Aristotle 's ' natural place ' or ' unper-ceivable substance ' (more on the latter in chapter 10). F r science to o be properly grounded, it must be grounded - Berkeley and most of hisempirically minded contemporaries similarly believed - in proofs stemming from that which was perceivable, demonstrable, and repro-ducible. But like so many principles which on rst enunciation seem so promising, and indeed even self-evidently true, Berkeley 's un-compromising insistence on the centrality of the role of perception indetermining what was to be regarded as real and what was to berelegated to the storehouse of mythology soon had some extremelycounterintuitive implications. Having adopted Locke 's notion thatsecondary properties have bona de credentials of reality (no onecould possibly doubt that he / she was in pain), Berkeley was driven,ineluctably, to the conclusion that material objects, existing independ-ently of their being observed, not only did not in fact exist, but were alogical impossibility. In pursuing to its inevitable conclusion a par-ticularly hard-nosed (or perhaps less charitably described, ham-sted)version of empiricism, Berkeley found himself driven away both fromCartesian dualism and from materialism*, to idealism* - to the theorythat only minds and their contents exist. So startling and unacceptablewas such a conclusion, however, that Berkeley ' saved the day ' byhaving God observe everything constantly and by His so doing keepthe external world in continuous existence. Needless to say, Berke-ley 's theological way out of his own dilemma about the existence ofthe external world (just like Leibniz 's earlier theological solution tothe dilemma about qualitative identity [see above, p. 233]) would tur nout to be one which would be shunned by his successors. Theologicalsolutions to metaphysical puzzles have not been much in vogue forcenturies. Indeed, even in those periods in history when they wererather more acceptable, they were always adopted only as a last resort.Metaphysics has always preferred natural explanations to super naturalProperties 239 ones. And in recent centuries, the tolerance for the latter has declined headlong. In the two-and-a-half centuries since Berkeley, scores of philoso- phers have tried to construct philosophical accounts which at once willdo justice to empiricism and the important role therein of theorizingcombined with deliberative, controlled observation and experimenta-tion, but without at the same time carrying Berkeley 's conclusion thatthe external world is a myth. Kant 's efforts in this regard were both monumental and heroic ([106]). But his particular solution, although eliciting extraordinarynumbers of responses and reactions, has not ear ned a contemporaryfollowing. In 1939, the redoubtable G.E. Moore (1873-1958) tried hisown hand in a remarkably curious and highly original article, \" AProof of the External W rld \". It is, at the very least, entertaining - and o perhaps a bit eye-opening - to sample the method of his argumenta-tion and the style of his unique prose. ... if I can prove that there exist now both a shoe and a sock, I shall have proved that there are now \" things outside of us \"; ...and similarly I shall have proved it, if I can prove that thereexist now two sheets of paper, or two human hands, or twoshoes, or two socks, etc. ... Cannot I prove any of these things? It seems to me that ... I can now give a large number of dif- ferent proofs, each of which is a perfectly rigorous proof ... Ican prove now, for instance, that two human hands exist. How?By holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a certaingesture with the right hand, \" Here is one hand, \" and adding, asI make a certain gesture with the left, \" and here is another. \" ... But did I prove just now that two human hands were then in existence? I do want to insist that I did; that the proof which Igave was a perfectly rigorous one; and that it is perhaps impos-sible to give a better or more rigorous proof of anythingwhatever. ([136], 144) Moore, himself, was under no illusions about the expected reception for his ' proof '. He knew that such a proof would be bound to elicitdissatisfaction, indeed even ridicule, from some other philosophers.Even so, Moore was convinced that he was on the right track. Be thatas it may, controversy still continues over the cogency of such anapproach. Some philosophers regard Moore 's work as a needed breath240 Beyond Experience of fresh air on a stuffy topic; others think it totally off-base, that it misses entirely the very problem facing Locke, Berkeley, and Kant. My own opinion as to the place to nd a solution leans heavily toward the revising of empiricism which has taken place in morerecent decades. When I went for a walk recently, I passed a parked car sporting a bumper sticker reading: \" When all else fails, lower your standards. \"Although I would normally simply smile at such an unabashedlyunreserved slogan and would dismiss it as being too sweeping, I recallit here because it has a particular relevance. It sums up succinctlywhat was wrong with Locke 's and Berkeley 's empiricism and pointsto the way out of their dilemma. Locke 's theory contained implicitly the requirement that the exist- ence of external objects could be known only through sensory experi-ence, or as it is sometimes called, the data of sense. But sensory dataare intrinsically ' in the mind '. Berkeley probed this feature of thethen-current version of empiricism remorselessly and saw, correctly,that it leads to a skepticism about the external world. The only way hewas able to see to escape his conclusion was to posit a God who kept aconstant vigil on the world. Contemporary metaphysics pursues another course. In particular, philosophy of late has dropped the inordinately high, unrealizablerequirement that sensory data be required to prove that the external, public, objective world is of one kind rather than some other. Thedemand for proof (understood in the sense of \" certainty \") has given way to the more realizable, tractable, and practicable demand forreasonable, although not necessarily conclusive, evidence for what-ever is being hypothesized. The moder n view is not that sensory dataprove, or ever could prove, the existence of a physical, external world,but that sensory data provide good grounds for regarding the hypothe-sis of the existence of a physical, external world as a reasonable posit,indeed as the best of the (currently) available alter natives. Moreover, there are two powerful incentives for adopting this particular posit.One, it matches the common, ordinary view of the way the world is;and two, it matches the scientic view of the way the world is. Butneither of these two benets can be regarded as establishing thehypothesis as being demonstrably true . W cannot, in any absolutelye conclusive way, prove that an external world exists. The hypothesisthat it does exist is a metaphysical posit , probably the most common metaphysical posit of our entire civilization. But for all that, it is apiece of metaphysical theorizing nevertheless and not an incontrover-Properties 241 tible ' fact '. It is after all possible, with some effort, to deny the exist- ence of an external world; it is possible, for example, to believe thatthe only things that exist are mental things. T cite a near, but not so o extreme, parallel: we have seen Christian Scientists, with perfect con-sistency both in word and in deed, deny the existence of disease. 9.2.2 Manifest versus dispositional properties Consider the contrast between the two properties is broken and is breakable , or between is bur ning and is flammable . The rst of each of these pairs, is broken and is bur ning , seems readily comprehen- sible. W recurrently encounter both broken and bur ning items. Indeede these properties of things can literally be seen. Their existence can be ascertained by direct observation. But what about the latter pairs ofproperties, breakable and flammable ? What sorts of properties are they? W cannot in general tell whether something is breakable simplye by looking at it; and only rarely - for some few selected kinds ofthings - can we tell, without putting a flame to it, whether somethingis flammable. These latter sorts of properties bear the technical name\" dispositions \". In a sense, they are properties in potentiality; they areproperties waiting, as it were, to break out into actuality. The flam-mable thing has the potential to become bur ned; the breakable thinghas the potential to become broken. The properties of being broken and of being bur ned are standardly said to be \" manifest \" properties. T be sure, this nomenclature is o somewhat ill-chosen, since \" manifest \" often carries the connotation ofbeing apparent or obvious. In the technical sense in which certainproperties are spoken of as being \" manifest \", there is no suggestionthat they are apparent or obvious. F r example, the charge on an elec- o tron or the peculiar structure of a carbon diamond crystal are anythingbut ' obvious '; and yet, in the technical sense being spoken of here, 6these properties are said to be manifest. F r technical purposes, then, o a \" manifest property \" means nothing more, or less, than a nondisposi-tional property of a thing. On an intuitive, pre-analytic basis, the distinction between manifest and dispositional properties seems both clear and r m enough. But on \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. A ter m which is sometimes used in place of \" manifest \" is \" occurrent \", but it too carries its own peculiar problems, and will not be used here.242 Beyond Experience careful probing, the distinction seems in danger of evaporating. Prop- erties like being square seem paradigmatically to be manifest, while being fragile or being flammable seem paradigmatically to be disposi- tional. But what about being red ? Do physical objects, e.g. ripe straw- berries, manifest the property of redness, or, as Locke hypothesized,do they merely have the ' power ' (i.e. the potential or disposition) tocause in us a sensation of redness under certain circumstances (e.g. thelighting being of a certain wavelength and intensity, our eyes andoptic nerves, etc., being in proper working order)? With examplessuch as the latter, the very distinction, or at least the criterion forapplying the distinction, seems in imminent danger of collapse. KarlP pper has even gone so far as to argue that all properties are, in theo nal analysis, dispositional: \" If ' breakable ' is dispositional, so is' broken ', considering for example how a doctor decides whether abone is broken or not. Nor should we call a glass ' broken ' if thepieces would fuse the moment they were put together: the criterion ofbeing broken is behaviour under certain conditions . Similarly, ' red ' is dispositional: a thing is red if it is able to reflect a certain kind of light- if it ' looks red ' in certain situations. But even ' looking red ' is dis-positional. It describes the disposition of a thing to make onlookersagree that it looks red \" ([159], 118). P pper 's suggestion that even the o property of being broken is dispositional may need a moment of clarication. How does a doctor tell whether a bone is broken?Presumably by administering some test: asking the patient to describehis / her sensations; manipulating the limb; looking for telltale swellingand hematoma; taking an X-ray; etc. In other words, the propertybeing broken has the disposition to produce certain results in certain test situations, including - in the case of the broken glass - the proper-ty of not fusing back together when reassembled. In P pper 's view, o then, the distinction between manifest and dispositional properties isnothing absolute, but merely one of degree. (W can anticipate that e devising a scheme to measure such a degree of difference will proveextremely difcult.) There is a temptation to locate dispositional properties in a peculiar niche in the scheme of things. On some accounts, dispositional prop-erties are portrayed as halfway houses along the road between nonex-istence and full-blown actuality. Solubility, for example, on this view,would be regarded as a property intermediary between being undis-solved and being dissolved. Such a theory is to be avoided, if possible.Normally we think of existence as a strictly all-or-nothing affair.There are no degrees of existence: either something exists, or it doesnot. There is nothing which half or partially exists. Of course it mayProperties 243 happen that some part of a thing exists while some other part does not. The east wing of an ofce building may have been demolished andremoved, and only the west wing remains. But it would be incorrect tosay that the ofce building now half exists. What makes better sense isto say that half the ofce building has gone out of existence, whilehalf the ofce building still exists. Having eschewed a notion of ' partial existence ' elsewhere in meta- physics, we should be extremely reluctant to invoke it in explicatingthe nature of dispositional properties. But if dispositional propertiesare not partial-existents, what might they be? Some metaphysicians regard irreducible potentialities as anathema: they will have no truck with them in their theories. Dispositions,according to these philosophers, are metaphysical misbegottens. Suchphilosophers adopt what is called a philosophy of actualism . The only properties which they will recognize as being \" real \" are actual, ormanifest, properties. But how, then, is one supposed to be able toaccount for the real difference between, let us say, a clay brick whichis not bur ning and is nonflammable, and a paper book which also maynot be bur ning but which indisputably is flammable? If neither is now(actually) bur ning, how are we to account for the fact that one is non-flammable and the other flammable? What does the latter distinctionamount to if not that one is not actually bur ning and the other one is?In short, how can dispositional properties be accounted for in ter ms ofactual (or manifest) properties? Actualists will have to maintain that in the case of the brick and the book, for example, there is some actual property other than its non-bur ning or bur ning which each has and which marks the difference.There will have to be, on their theory, some actual property which thebrick has which prevents its bur ning, while there will have to be some(other) actual property which the book has which allows for its bur n-ing. In neither case are there any merely ' possible ' properties lurking 7behind the scenes, as it were, waiting to break out into full actuality. If dispositional properties (\" fragile \", \" semiper meable \", \" helio- tropic \", etc.) gure prominently in natural science, they seem to be atleast as, if not more, prominent in our explanations of human behav-ior. Our descriptions of personality seem invariably to be couchedalmost exclusively in ter ms of dispositional properties. A given personmay be honest, sentimental, loving, caring, punctual, hardworking, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7. F r more on this issue, see Elizabeth Prior 's monograph, Dispositions o ([161]).244 Beyond Experience fastidious, and slow to anger. All these properties, we note, are to be regarded more as dispositional than manifest. But how are we toaccount for persons having such properties? There seem to be someprospects for our coming to understand, from a physical point of view,how a person feels a pain. W might even, that is, reach the point in e the foreseeable future of physico-psychological research where wewill be able to ' pin down ' the source and mechanism, as it were, inour physical bodies of our pains. But will we be able, similarly, toaccount for dispositions such as a person 's being honest? There is noreason to think that the task is in principle impossible. But neithershould we underestimate its magnitude. T see how formidable is the o task of accounting for dispositions in ter ms of manifest (actual) prop-erties, just ask yourself what manifest property of a person could pos-sibly account for his (having a tendency toward) being stingy or (alikelihood of ) being self-deprecating. Physico-psychological theorieswhich would permit the reducing of human dispositions to manifestproperties of physiological states are not even in their nascency. In light of what has just been said, it may appear that the entire the- ory of dispositional properties is so rudimentary as to be unworthy ofnotice. But such a conclusion would reflect a misunderstanding of thephilosophic enterprise. A philosopher 's progress toward a theory is atleast a two-step, often an iterated, procedure. When Carnap tried toexplicate the curious practice we call \" philosophical analysis \" (seeabove, pp. 102-8), he emphasized the importance of the role of eluci-dating the explicandum, the pre-analytic concept, which is eventuallyto be replaced by an improved concept, the explicatum. There is a temptation to think that, since the explicandum can- not be given in exact ter ms anyway, it does not matter muchhow we for mulate the problem. But this would be quite wrong.On the contrary, since even in the best case we cannot reachfull exactness, we must, in order to prevent the discussion ofthe problem from becoming entirely futile, do all we can tomake at least practically clear what is meant as the explican-dum. ... It seems to me that, in raising problems of analysis orexplication, philosophers very frequently violate this require-ment. They ask questions like: ' What is causality? ', ' What islife? ', ' What is mind? ', ' What is justice? ', etc. Then they oftenimmediately start to look for an answer without rst examiningthe tacit assumption that the ter ms of the question are at leastpractically clear enough to serve as a basis for investigation, foran analysis or explication. Even though the ter ms in questionProperties 245 are unsystematic, inexact ter ms, there are means for reaching a relatively good mutual understanding as to their intended mean-ing. An indication of the meaning with the help of someexamples for its intended use and other examples for uses notnow intended can help the understanding. ... By explanationsof this kind the reader may obtain ... a clearer picture of whatis to be included and what is intended to be excluded; thus hemay reach an understanding of the meaning intended which isfar from perfect theoretically but may be sufcient for the prac- tical purposes of a discussion of possible explications. ([45], 4-5; italics added) What we have here been doing is laying the necessary groundwork for any eventual, viable theory of dispositional properties. W should not e be disheartened that we are unable to propose nished theories.Having introduced the distinction between manifest and dispositionalproperties, and having explored some of the problems (e.g. whetherthe distinction is absolute or merely one of degree, and whether poten-tialities are reducible in principle to actual properties), we can contentourselves with intuitive notions of these concepts. W need feel no e particular difdence about our stopping at this point. As I explainedearlier, in the case of the concept of possible world , not every concept needs to be claried in order for us to be able to use the concept andindeed to get much mileage out of it. ( Two thousand years of mathe-matics proceeded apace with no viable explication of number at all.) F r present purposes, the concepts of manifest and dispositional prop- o erty have been elucidated sufciently for us to proceed. 9.2.3 Binary properties; comparative and quantitative properties It is a poor joke which describes a woman as \" half-pregnant \". Being pregnant is one among a class of properties which are strictly binary,i.e. such properties occur in an all-or-nothing manner. Either a womanis, or she is not, pregnant: there is nothing halfway, as it were, be-tween nongravidity and pregnancy. Similarly, a given combination ofplaying cards in a game of gin rummy either has, or does not have, theproperty of being a meld. Binary properties, we say, \" do not come indegrees \". Many properties do, however. Y ur car may be heavier than mine: o its weight is greater than, or exceeds, the weight of my car. Or, again,my piano may be more out of tune than yours: its dissonance is greater246 Beyond Experience than, or exceeds, that of your piano. These properties - weight, dis- sonance, intelligence, hardness, etc. - permit of ordering . Such prop- erties, which do come in degrees, are sometimes spoken of as being' qualitative ' properties. But since we will use the word \" quality \" in aspecialized sense in a moment (in section 9.2.6), we will not adoptthat particular nomenclature, preferring instead to call propertieswhich come in degrees ' comparative ' properties. Accordingly, preg-nancy is a binary property; but length of pregnancy is a comparativeproperty: one woman may be in her fourth month of pregnancy whileanother is in her third. The for mer, although being no more pregnantthan the latter, will have been pregnant for a greater length of time. Certain comparative properties themselves feature a further prop- 8erty. Some comparative properties - weight, for example - occur inquantiable amounts in such a way as to permit us to say that onething exceeds another in that property by some speciable factor. In-telligence, for example, although, like weight, a comparative property,lacks this further feature. A person with an intelligence quotient ( I Q) of, let us say, 150, is not twice as intelligent as a person with an I Q of 75. The joint intellectual efforts of two persons each with an I Q of 75 will not match that of a person blessed with an I Q of 150. But the com- bined weight of two persons each with a weight of 75 kg will equalthe weight of a person of 150 kg. The property of weight, then, isquantiable in a way in which intelligence quotient is not. W ight is e 9said to satisfy ' the law of addition '; intelligence not. Such obvious differences, and their causes, explanations, and peculiarities, have been the subject of much research in the past onehundred years. One of the most telling differences between themoder n period of physics (i.e. since the seventeenth century) and itsprecursor has been the emphasis on quantitative measurements of thesort we see possible in the example of weight. And one of the most \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8. This claim is no mistake. Properties may themselves have properties. This hierarchical structure of properties has been implicit throughout this entirediscussion. The property of pregnancy, for example, is binary, we havealready said. Spelled out in greater detail, what we have said is that the prop-erty of being pregnant itself has the property of being binary. Etc. 9. The classic study of the distinction being alluded to here is Norman Campbell 's F undations of Science ([43]; see esp. chap. 10). More recent o ' classic studies ' include S.S. Stevens 's \" On the Theory of Scales of Measure-ment \" ([197]). Brian Ellis 's Basic Concepts of Measurement ([66]) includes a good bibliography through 1966.Properties 247 enduring debates in the philosophy of science has been on the ques- tion whether the sorts of measurements which are common withinphysics, and consequently the sorts of scientic laws it is possible toadumbrate within physics, should be thought to be the goal as well of' softer ' sciences. Is psychology somehow less ' authentic ', somehow a' lesser science ', if it fails to state laws holding between quantitativeproperties? Is a science which is conned to ascertaining orderings -e.g. being able to determine that P rson A 's rage is greater than P rsonee B 's rage, without being able to measure how much one person 's rage exceeds that of another - any less a science? Is the hallmark of a genuine science its ability to produce quantitative laws, i.e. laws stat-ing relationships between quantitative properties, or is that merely afortuitous feature of a few select sciences, e.g. physics, chemistry, and(perhaps) economics? It is an innocent-sounding philosopher 's distinction at rst glance: that between those comparative properties which do not permit furtherquantication and those which do. And yet, on this seemingly subtledistinction rests one of the longest-lasting and intensely personaldebates in the philosophy of moder n science. Scientists, particularlythose in some of the social sciences, are put on the defensive by theirpresent inability to posit properties having the quantitative features ofthose of physics. While physicists may invoke mass, energy, heat, etc.,all of which are quantiable, social scientists, it seems, often have tomake do with ' softer ' properties: intelligence, anger, hostility, covet-ousness, caring, etc., all of which may be (roughly) ordered, but noneof which seems to be nonarbitrarily quantiable. What is at stake is avery fundamental view, call it metaphysical if you will, of the ultimatenature of physical reality. Certain particularly tough-nosed physicistsare likely to conceive of the world as ultimately constituted of thingsbearing quantitative properties; other researchers believe that no suchaccount - restricted solely to such properties - could ever do justice tothe richness and diversity of reality. The debate cuts right to the quickof scientists ' view of the world and of the validity of their professionalpursuits. F r in this arcane distinction lurks a challenge to the very o basis of the practice in which scientists daily engage. 9.2.4 Intensive versus extensive properties; eliminable and ineliminable concepts Properties of properties of properties of ... - there seems to be no limit to our ingenuity to classify, to subclassify, to subsubclassify, andso on. And thus it should come as no surprise that the very category of248 Beyond Experience quantitative property itself should be further subdividable, i.e. that cer- tain quantiable properties should themselves have properties whichother quantiable properties lack. One of the most interesting, and at the same time peculiar, set of properties to appear in the philosopher 's inventory is that of intensiveand extensive properties. T ke a thin aluminum rod. It will have a various quantitative properties including, for example, the properties 3of having a mass of 6 kg and having a density of 2.7 g / cm . Nowbreak the rod into two equal parts. The mass of each part will be(exactly) half the mass of the original unbroken rod; but the density ofeach half will be (precisely) the same as the density of the original.How very strange: the mass subdivided with the rod; its density didnot. Properties which, like mass, diminish upon objects ' being brokendown into smaller parts are said to be ' extensive '; those which, likedensity, do not, are said to be ' intensive '. (These two ter ms, inciden-tally, have nothing whatsoever to do with the distinction between\" extension \" and \" intension \" which is common in moder n semantics.) The metaphysical signicance of this latest distinction is an out- growth of the immediately preceding one. W have just seen how e some physicists believe that the ultimately signicant properties of theworld are quantitative ones. But some physicists will want to go evenfurther, and want to rene this latter thesis. It is not just quantitativeproperties which are ultimately ' real ' but, more particularly, it is ex-tensive quantitative properties which for m the foundation upon whichwe may hope to erect our understanding of the universe. Y u can see why one might have this prejudice toward extensiveo properties, if one, that is, is going to have a prejudice at all toward theprimacy of quantitative properties. T king density as our example, we a can see that the concept of density is - in an absolutely clear-cut way - totally eliminable, expendable, in any scientic theory. Any theorywhich invokes the concept of density could, just as well, invoke the concept of mass per unit volume . But does the expendability of the concept of density imply that the property density is ' unreal ' or, as some writers put it, just a convenient ' mathematical ction '. Is theter m \" density \" just a convenient shorthand for \" mass per unit vol- ume \", and should we want to argue that there really is no such proper- ty as density which is referred to by this ter m? It is illuminating to look into the history of the evolution of the interplay of these various concepts. In Newton 's Principia (1687), for example, we nd that the order of denitions is precisely the reverseProperties 249 of today 's nor ms. F r Newton, density was the primitive concept, and o he dened mass in ter ms of density. The opening sentence of the book reads: \" The quantity of matter [i.e. mass] is the measure of the same,arising from its density and bulk [i.e. volume] conjointly \" ([144], 1).On the moder n account, we say that density is equal to mass ' dividedby ' volume. But given that relationship, it is also certainly true to sayof a body - as Newton did - that its mass is equal to its density ' times 'its volume. F r Newton, density, not mass, was the fundamental, or at o 10least more familiar, concept. It was a well-known fact, for example, that iron floats on mercury, and that gold sinks in mercury. Substancescould be arranged in order of ascending density: iron, mercury, gold.This property, determined by what floats on what, and what sinks inwhat, seemed to be fundamental, intrinsic, and did not depend for itsdetermination on measuring either the mass or the volume of the sub-stances involved. Later, it was recognized that one could assign notjust orderings to the densities of substances, but specic numericalvalues, by using the measure of a substance 's mass divided by a meas-ure of its volume. This both introduced a new ' handle ' on the conceptand allowed persons to measure densities for cases where the float /sink method was inapplicable, e.g. in the case of gold and platinum. What we nd is that one can do physics, both better and more easily, if one takes as one 's fundamental concepts mass and volume, rather than density and volume. (A parallel account can be constructed 11for the logic of the concept of speed. ) Even so, this still leaves open the question whether the property of density is ' real ' or ' unreal '. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. See, also, Cajori 's notes to the Principia ([144], 638-9). 11. \" Speed \" is eliminable in favor of \" distance covered divided by elapsed time \" (e.g. kilometers per hour). But children have the concept of speed with- out having the latter concept of distance covered per unit of time . (Remem- ber, too, that mariners use a concept of speed, knots, which makes no reference either to distance or to time. It is not \" knots / hour \", but \" knots \" tout court.) Children have the for mer naive concept of speed insofar as they know such things as that Alice can run faster than Betty (i.e. has greater speed thanBetty), and that Betty, in tur n, can run faster than Carol. But these samechildren may be several years away in their intellectual development fromhaving the more sophisticated concept of distance covered per unit time . F ro one thing, the latter concept involves the mathematical operation of division,and that concept - if it comes at all - comes much later in a child 's com-prehension.250 Beyond Experience It should be clear that there can be no simple truth or falsity in any forthcoming answer. Someone who argues for the ' unreality ' of theproperty of density (or of speed) is, tacitly, advancing the metaphysi-cal thesis that our decisions about what is real and what is not shouldbe decided by the test of what is taken to be fundamental and inelim-inable in physics (and perhaps in other sciences as well). Physics (andscience in general) on this account gives us an access to what is ulti-mately ' real '. But one is by no means forced to adopt that particular metaphysical thesis. And indeed, it is more than just a little resistible. Certainly onecan, with coherence and conviction, argue that the foregoing meta-physical theory is overly parsimonious. One can argue that the fun-damental concepts of science probably do match fundamental featuresof the world without having to subscribe to the stronger thesis that theonly features there are in the world are those which play important and central roles in science. One can, that is, accept the revelations of sci-ence without subscribing to the claim that nothing else is real. There is a more direct objection as well. It is not at all clear that there is any particular way of recognizing fundamental as opposed todenable properties. That is, there may not be any particular propertythat properties themselves have which identies them as being inelim-inable or not. I have already argued (in chapter 5) that there well maynot be any one way of doing science; indeed I think it overwhelminglylikely that there is not. What may be fundamental, ineliminable, inone scheme of science may be denable and eliminable in another. Wehave already seen how, in certain reconstructions of Newtonian phys-ics (footnote 8, p. 85), the very concept of mass itself dropped out. There is an important conclusion to draw from this debate about the reality or unreality of those properties which correspond to eliminableconcepts. W are often tempted to regard questions about what is real e as if all of them were empirical questions to be settled - if not alwaysin practice, then at least in principle - by scientists pursuing the exper-imental method. But it should be clear that science is, by itself,impotent to answer even as simple a question as whether density (or speed ) is a ' real ' property or merely a ' ction '. How much more impotent science must be, then, to answer the signicantly more dif-cult question whether there is such a property as intelligence (or evil or free will ). The answers to such questions simply cannot be had by scientic means. The answers to such questions reside in proposing,debating, and choosing among alter native metaphysical theories.Properties 251 W are tugged in two different directions. It seems strange to denye that density is a real property, and yet we fully appreciate the argu-ments and motivations of someone who promotes that thesis. But theensuing tension we might feel evidences the fact that we standardlyoperate with a variety of criteria for invoking the very concept ofreality itself. In the case of intensive properties, those criteria can be made to conflict with one another. And what is ultimately at stake isnot a truth about whether intensive properties are ' real ' or not: therecould not possibly be an answer to such a question given the tensions inherent in our very concept of what it is to be ' real '. Rather what isinvolved in our trying to decide whether intensive properties are realis an effort to try to decide which of our various criteria of reality wewant to give primacy to. The answer to this latter question cannot beone of mere random choice. W will choose, both in light of our pre- e philosophical intuitions and in light of what future mileage we hope toget out of the revised concept. 9.2.5 Emergent versus nonemergent properties Philosophers ' fascination with properties seems endless. In the 1920s, a number of philosophers - including, among others, C. Lloyd Mor- 12gan ([138]), J.C. Smuts ([196]), and S. P pper ([150]) - picking up e from some provocative, but undeveloped, notions in Mill 's theory ofcausation ([135], book I I I, chap. V I) proposed a theory of emergent properties. The principal gure among this group was C.D. Broad. ... most of the chemical and physical properties of water have no known connexion, either quantitative or qualitative, withthose of Oxygen and Hydrogen. Here we have a clear instanceof a case where, so far as we can tell, the properties of a wholecomposed of two constituents could not have been predictedfrom a knowledge of the properties of these constituents takenseparately, or from this combined with a knowledge of theproperties of other wholes which contain these constituents. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12. Jan Christiaan Smuts (1870-1950) had an astounding career. Not only was he a philosopher, albeit a minor one, he was also a player on the world 'spolitical stage. From 1919 to 1924, and from 1939 to 1948, he served asprime minister of South Africa.252 Beyond Experience ... It is clear that in no case could the behaviour of a whole composed of certain constituents be predicted merely from a knowledge of the properties of these constituents, taken sepa-rately, and of their proportions and arrangements in the par-ticular complex under consideration.... T ke any ordinary statement, such as we nd in chemistrya books; e.g., \" Nitrogen and Hydrogen combine when an electriccharge is passed through a mixture of the two. The resultingcompound contains three atoms of Hydrogen to one of Nitro-gen; it is a gas readily soluble in water, and possessed of a pun-gent characteristic smell. \" If the mechanistic theory be true ...[a mathematical] archangel could deduce from his knowledgeof the microscopic structure of atoms all these facts but the last.He would know exactly what the microscopic structure ofammonia must be; but he would be totally unable to predict thata substance with this structure must smell as ammonia doeswhen it gets into the human nose. The utmost that he couldpredict on this subject would be that certain changes would takeplace in the mucous membrane, the olfactory nerves and so on.But he could not possibly know that these changes would beaccompanied by the appearance [i.e. occurrence] of a smell ingeneral or of the peculiar smell of ammonia in particular,unless someone told him so or he had smelled it for himself.([35], 63 and 71) Broad is actually advancing here two theses, a positive one and a negative. On the positive side, he argues that certain properties of' wholes ' are deducible (he uses the ter m \" predictable \" as a synonym)from a knowledge of the properties of their parts. F r example, he o suggests that a knowledge of the properties of hydrogen and nitrogenwould allow us to deduce that atoms of these elements will combine inthe ratio of three to one. On the negative side, he argues that this fea-ture just remarked for the combining ratios does not hold universally.He suggests, for example, that the existence of the distinctive smell ofammonia could not be deduced from a knowledge of the properties of hydrogen and nitrogen. There really is a very gripping metaphysical thesis at play here. F r o Broad is operating with the intuitive notion that somehow certainphysical properties of things are ' contained within ' the properties oftheir parts; but that other properties are, in some sense, unexpectedor novel. These latter properties are said to be \"emergent\". In someProperties 253 metaphorical sense, they seem to be a step above on the ladder of reality. Is the theory viable? As Broad stated it, the theory contains a strik- ing logical fallacy. Er nest Nagel has adroitly exposed the error ([139],366-97). Nagel argues that there is no absolute or ahistorical sense of\" emergent \". Whether a property is emergent or not, i.e. whether theexistence of some property may be deduced from some body ofknowledge, depends entirely on the infor mation contained in that 13body of knowledge. But there is nothing, nor could there be, whichcounts denitively as knowledge of hydrogen and nitrogen. It is up tous to decide just what we choose to include and to exclude in any suchbody of knowledge. If certain infor mation is included, we will be ableto deduce certain facts about ammonia; if not, then not. The only sensein which a property can justiably be said to be emergent is within ahistorical setting. At some stage in the development of scienticknowledge no proposition describing the smell of ammonia may bededucible from then-current scientic knowledge; but with the growthof knowledge, may add to our storehouse of infor mation sothat such a proposition does become deducible. Emergence, then, inNagel 's reconstruction, is no metaphysical property at all, merely ahistorical footnote to the progress of science. What may be emergenttoday may well be nonemergent tomorrow. Is Nagel 's dismissal of Broad 's intuitions too swift, too damning? Might it be that Broad expressed himself carelessly, but was, nonethe-less, onto something of fundamental importance? Did he reallyglimpse an important metaphysical distinction or was he merely thevictim of a logical confusion? In short, are there emergent properties? Let 's retur n for a moment to Broad 's example. The motivating intu- ition in all of this was his tacit belief that there is something funda- mentally different between ammonia 's ability to, for example, dissolve in water and its ability to cause in us a certain kind of reaction. Thefor mer seemed somehow ' physical ', or at least it was a disposition to \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13. Logicians will know that the principle has been stated casually. A more precise formulation - intended for technically trained readers - is: \" (1)Whether a statement containing a given predicate is deducible or not dependson the infor mation logically contained in the premises. (2) A predicate canoccur nonvacuously in the conclusion of a deductively valid inference which has a self-consistent premise-set only if that predicate occurs explicitly in atleast one of the premises. \"254 Beyond Experience bring about a physical state, while the latter was somehow ' more men- tal ', or at least was a disposition to bring about a mental state. Is this a' real distinction ' worthy of preservation, and indeed encapsulation, inthe distinction between physical and nonphysical, between nonemer-gent and emergent? Again, it must be clear that the question is not ascientic one. It concer ns not one 's scientic theorizing, or one 'slaboratory practice, but a metaphysical view as to what ultimately oneis looking at and trying to make sense of. The situation is this: If you are convinced that there is some impor- tant, metaphysical distinction between ' the physical ' on the one handand ' the mental ' on the other, you may well nd yourself attracted tothe theory of emergence and may try to so restrict the class of physicalproperties as to allow for the occurrence of emergent properties. Thetrouble with this procedure, however, is that it skirts the very edge ofarbitrariness. It is exceedingly difcult to draw a nonarbitrary dividingline between the physical and the mental. If your metaphysicalinstincts lie on the other side, you may well want to allow virtuallyany property to count as ' physical ', in which case there will not beemergent properties. The point is that the answer to the question \" Arethere emergent properties? \" has no ready answer. It depends on themetaphysical views one has of the world and on one 's abilities topreserve those views in theories which are logically sound. The metaphysical instincts of the Emergentists of the 1920s seem clear enough. But none of them was ever able to capture those in-stincts in a theory which satises the rigorous strictures of logic.Whether their goal can ever be realized, or indeed is even worth real-izing, is a chapter of philosophy not yet written. 9.2.6 Qualities versus relations In his novel The Red and the Black , Stendhal offers the following description of Julien Sorel: His cheeks were flushed, his eyes downcast. He was a slim youth of eighteen or nineteen, weak in appearance, with irregu-lar but delicate features and an aquiline nose. His large eyes,which, in moments of calm, suggested a reflective, ery spiritwere animated at this instant with an expression of the mostferocious hatred. Hair of a dark chestnut, growing very low,gave him a narrow brow, and in moments of anger a wickedair. Among the innumerable varieties of the human coun-Properties 255 tenance, there is perhaps none that is more strikingly charac- teristic. A slim and shapely gure betokened suppleness ratherthan strength. In his childhood, his extremely pensive air andmarked pallor had given his father the idea that he would notlive ... ([28], 28-9). The only thing remarkable about this passage is its familiar formula: it is one of a piece with countless other descriptive passages all of ushave read. In particular, it is far more remarkable for what it does notsay, what it chooses to leave out, than what it does say. There is in principle no end of descriptive detail one can produce. But there are conventions . Although it may be true (I do not know whether it is or not) that my son Efrem sits in front of his friend T dd o in English class at their school, I would not normally think to includethis infor mation if asked to describe Efrem. No more so did Stendhalinclude in his description of Julien such possible data as that Julienwas - at the moment of being described - standing 22 meters from theone oak tree on the property or that Julien was twice as old as thepriest 's nephew in P ris. W simply do not usually consider such ae ' peculiar ' properties as sitting in front of , or standing 22 meters from , or being twice as old as as being proper, or intrinsic, properties of things. In describing things, we usually omit to mention such proper-ties. These latter sorts of properties - sitting in front of , standing 22 meters from , or being twice as old as - are relations , that is, they are properties which hold between two or more things. Being red is a property of individual items; being more intensively red than is a property which holds between two items. Properties which may bepredicated* (to use the technical ter m) of single items - e.g. being red , being square , having a mass of 6.2 kg , even being flammable - are said to be ' qualities ' (alter natively, ' attributes '). (Note, in this techni-cal sense, \" quality \" does not mean being valuable or of superiormanufacture, etc. A ' quality ' is simply a property which a single thingmay bear.) Being to the left of , being heavier than , being twice as old as, etc., are not qualities of things, but relations among things. One common way philosophers sometimes try to draw the distinc- tion between qualities and relations is to take recourse to some factsabout the ter ms we typically use for these properties. T for m a gram- o matical sentence using the phrase \" ... is rectangular \", we need toprovide the name of but one thing, e.g. \" Boston Symphony Hall isrectangular. \" T for m a grammatical sentence using the phrase \"... o256 Beyond Experience is higher than ...\", we need to supply two names, e.g. \"Mt Rainier is higher than Mt Hood.\" In addition to two-place relations (\" ... ishigher than ... \"), there ... ... \"),and four-place relations (\" ... combined with ... tastes a lot like ...combined with ... \"). Indeed relations may, and do, obtain betweenany number of things whatsoever. According to this latter, linguistic, reconstruction of the distinction between qualities and relations, there is nothing remarkable what-soever about their difference. Qualities appear as nothing other than 14one-place relations. They are merely the rst in a series of stepwiseincrease. But if there is nothing remarkable about qualities whenviewed from the standpoint of logic or mathematics, do they nonethe-less have some special status metaphysically? The four-place relationwe just cited as an example, \" ... when combined with ... tastes a lotlike ... combined with ... \", will undoubtedly strike many persons asbeing somehow bogus. While they may be perfectly prepared toacknowledge the reality of such qualities as being red or having a mass of 6.2 kg , these persons will regard this latter, four-place, relation as being articial. Is this mere prejudice, or are there goodreasons for regarding relations as ' articial '? Two different factsabout our metaphysical views may help to explain the naturally feltantipathy some persons have toward relations. First is the strongly held intuition that things can change their rela- tions without losing their identity. A delicate crystal vase, forexample, in being moved from a high shelf to a tabletop remains the' same vase ': the change in its spatial relations (from having been twometers above the floor to now being only one meter above the floor)has not affected its identity. But let that same vase drop from the shelfto the tabletop so that it shatters, so that it loses its property of whole-ness or cohesiveness, then it ceases to be the ' same thing '. What hadbeen a vase is no longer; the vase has gone out of existence to havebeen replaced by a collection of glass shards. Or, again, a person maymove across town: the change in her spatial relations to other thingsdoes not (generally) affect her identity. She is still the same person.But let her lose her memory, or let her undergo a radical change in \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 14. Below, unless it is explicitly qualied as \" one-place \" (or \" monadic \"), the ter m \" relation \" will be used to designate the class of dyadic (two-place),triadic (three-place), etc., relations. W will continue to use the ter m e \" quality \" for \" one-place relation \".Properties 257 personality, and the resulting individual is not the ' same ' person. Such conceptions are very deeply seated in our world-views. In askingabout the identity and ' nature ' of things, we almost invariably inquireafter their qualities. Qualities (or at least some important subset ofqualities), not relations, are generally taken to constitute a thing 's' essence '. And thus Stendhal describes Julien as: being flushed , having downcast eyes , appearing weak , having irregular features , having delicate features , having animated eyes , possessing a ery spirit, having chestnut hair , etc. Relations, in contrast, are regarded as extrinsic, as mere accidents or incidentals. \" My son 's being good-natured is a ' real ' property of him; his happening, at the moment, tobe standing two feet from my desk is just an accidental feature, it hasnothing to do with who or what he is \", many persons might be in- clined to argue. This rst reason why persons might feel uneasy about ceding full reality to relations, refusing to deem them real properties of things,lies pretty close to the surface as it were. But there is a second, muchdeeper, reason which additionally infor ms the thinking of some per-sons and makes them antagonistic toward granting the reality of rela-tions. In ancient philosophy, Aristotle had advanced a logic whichtreated certain kinds of propositions: singular propositions (e.g.\" Alexander the Great was a soldier \") whose subjects are individualthings (persons, places, times, etc.); and general propositions, whosesubjects are classes of things. General propositions are further sub-dividable into universal propositions (e.g. \" All men are mortal \") andparticular* (e.g. \" Some men are blue-eyed \"). But what is common toall these kinds of propositions is that they single out one subject (e.g. Alexander the Great; the class of men) and then proceed to predicateof the subject a quality (attribute). Such propositions are standardlyknown as ' subject / predicate ' propositions. But are these the onlytypes of propositions? Does every proposition predicate a quality of asubject? F r over two thousand years, until the early part of the twentietho century, most philosophers believed so. Few, if any, were inclined orbold enough to propose that logic should and needed to be expandedto encompass relational propositions as well. Their resistance cameabout through the belief that relational propositions could - in prin-ciple - be replaced by, or be ' reduced to ', subject / predicate proposi-tions. This belief was in tur n prompted by the belief that relationsthemselves, e.g. being west of or being taller than , were eliminable in favor of qualities. How might this be argued?258 Beyond Experience There are two different ways one might think it possible to elimi- nate relations. Consider what we might take to be a paradigmatic instance of a re- lational proposition, e.g. the proposition expressed by the sentence\" John is west of T ronto. \" In moder n logic, this proposition would be o taken to refer to three ' things ': the two individual items, John andT ronto, and the relation, being west of . But there is a way to parse the o English sentence, a way that is commonly taught in high-school gram-mar classes, a way that reflects its origins in the theory that all sen-tences are of subject / predicate for m. According to that grammaticaltheory, the subject of the sentence (or proposition) is \" John \" and thepredicate is \" is west of T ronto \". On this classical account, there are o just two things being referred to in the sentence: the one individualthing, viz. John, and one quality (attribute), viz. the quality of being west of T ronto . Such ' properties ' as being west of T ronto are some- oo times, understandably, called ' relational properties '. Which is it? Is being west of T ronto a quality (a relational proper-o ty) of John, or is being west of a relation holding between John and T ronto? Two considerations favor plumping for the latter - the rela-o tional - account. Suppose a person says, \" My father and mother are divorced. \" How would we construe this if we were to adopt the theory that makes rela-tions simple qualities? What shall the subject of this sentence be takento be? Shall we construe it this way: \" My father is (i.e. has the qualityof being) divorced-from-my-mother \"; or in this: \" My mother is (i.e.has the quality of being) divorced-from-my-father \"? Either choiceseems wholly arbitrary. It is far less arbitrary to regard both father andmother ' equally ' as subjects, standing to one another in the relation-ship of being divorced from one another . The point is that if one argues that all relational propositions are ' convertible into ' subject /predicate propositions, then one can often, if not always, choose thesubject only arbitrarily. Is the sentence \" John is west of T ronto \" any o more ' about ' John than it is ' about ' T ronto? Is the sentence \" Ronald o and Nancy are married (to each other) \" any more ' about ' Ronald thanit is ' about ' Nancy? The second consideration suggesting that we might prefer to con- strue such sentences as \" John is west of T ronto \" as relational rather o than as being subject / predicate has to do with the peculiarity of therelational-property of being west of T ronto . Compare the (single-o place) quality being west of T ronto with the (two-place) relation ofoProperties 259 being west of . The quality, but not the relation, in a sense invokes or refers to an individual*, viz. T ronto. One might, on metaphysical o grounds, regard ' qualities ' which refer to individuals as being no' real ' qualities at all: one might, that is, want to advance a theorywhich makes individuals, on the one hand, distinct kinds of entitiesfrom qualities, on the other. If so, then the hybrid expression \" is westof T ronto \", inasmuch as it refers to an individual (the city of T ron-oo to), would be deemed not to refer to any quality at all. P rhaps, though, there may be another way to eliminate relations,e one which would, again, offer qualities in their place, but whichwould not take recourse to ' hybrid-qualities ' (relational properties)such as being west of T ronto . Can this be done? This brings us to ano examination of a more radical approach some philosophers have takenin their attempts to argue that relations are in principle eliminable infavor of qualities. Here we might take as our example the relational proposition that object O has twice the mass of object O . How might one argue that 12 such a proposition can be replaced by a proposition containing only one-place predicates, i.e. ter ms referring to qualities? In this way:remember that every material thing has a mass. When one asserts,then, that object O has twice the mass of object O , one could argue 12 that what was being asserted was true only insofar as O had some1 particular mass (an attribute) [e.g. 40 g] and O had some particular2 mass [e.g. 20 g]. The relational claim - that O has twice the mass of1 O - could be regarded, then, as reducible to two nonrelational, sub-2 ject / predicate claims about the masses of O and of O respectively.12 Or again, consider the relational proposition that Lincoln was similar to W shington. The natural reaction in someone 's being told thisa might well be to ask, \" In what respects were they similar? \" And theanswer may be, \" They were both Presidents \", or \" They were bothexcellent public speakers \", or \" They were both elected to secondter ms \", etc. In these latter cases, attributes - being President , being elected to a second ter m , etc. - are predicated of each person individ- ually. The relational proposition \" Lincoln was similar to W shington \" a is replaceable by the two nonrelational propositions \" Lincoln was aPresident \" and \" W shington was a President. \" With examples such as a these at hand, some philosophers have argued that attributes (qualities)are to be regarded as ineliminable and ' real ', while relations are to beregarded as eliminable and ' unreal '. There are, however, at least two problems with the theory that rela-260 Beyond Experience tions are in principle eliminable in favor of qualities. First is the dif- culty that relational propositions and their supposed nonrelationalreplacements in general do not mean the same thing (or more exactly, they are not logically equivalent). Consider, again, the claim that O 1 has twice the mass of O . Suppose, as above, that this relational claim2 is true just because O has a mass of 40 g and O a mass of 20 g. The12 latter conditions will ' make ' the relational claim true. But are the lat- ter conditions implied by the for mer, relational, claim? Clearly not.Someone can assert that O has twice the mass of O without having 12 any idea what the mass is of either object: only that the mass of the for mer is double that of the latter. The for mer, relational, propositioncan be true without either of the latter, nonrelational, propositionsbeing true. There are, in fact, an innite number of pairs of nonrela-tional propositions which could ' make ' the relational proposition true. The second difculty comes about through the challenge that some relations do not seem, even in principle, to be eliminable in favorof qualities. Consider a possible world consisting of three physicalobjects, A, B, and C, spatially arranged so that B is between the objects 15A and C. What quality does any of these objects possess which accounts for the truth that B is between A and C? W might try to saye that A lies to the left of B and that B lies to the left of C. But saying this will not have eliminated relations: it will simply have invoked adifferent relation, viz. the relation of lying to the left of . Or, to take another example, suppose that line L lies parallel to line L . What 12 qualities might we imagine each line to possess ' all on its own ' which might account for its being parallel to the other? Nothing whatsoeversuggests itself as a plausible candidate. What, nally, are we to make of all this? When all is said and done, are relations ' real ' or are they not? There have never been any knock-down arguments on either side: neither party to the dispute has ever \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 15. W often, naively, suppose that the relation of betweenness is unprob- e lematic. But it is not. If I am right in what I earlier argued (see section 8.6),viz. that visual space need not correlate with tactile space, then there is thepossibility that an object which is seen to be between another two might not be felt to be between those two. Indeed I suspect that the successful use of the concept of betweenness usually rests on our presupposing a certain context: we assume that we are talking about spatial distribution; or visual; or tactile;or mass; or temperature; or ... But we need not trouble ourselves here overthis complication. F r the purposes of the present example, we can simply o stipulate that we are talking about three objects in visual space.Properties 261 shown that the other 's arguments are self-inconsistent. And, of course, it is in the very nature of the debate that no empirical evidence couldpossibly settle the question. Nonetheless, the view which would makerelations every bit as ' real ' as qualities has clearly in the last centuryalmost entirely vanquished the theory that qualities alone are real andthat relations are unreal. The change in attitude has come about prin-cipally through the remarkable successes and power of moder n logic,which has abandoned the straitjacket of subject / predicate sentencesfor relational ones. Subject / predicate sentences have become in thismoder n account merely a special case - that of one-place relations -of relational sentences. The ground has shifted, not because the oldtheory was ever demonstrably shown to be false or mistaken, butbecause the new theory is so much more congenial and so much morepowerful. T the extent that one believes that aesthetic features - such o as beauty and elegance - and simplicity are indicative of truth, then, tothat extent, one can believe that the moder n theory is true. But no oneshould believe that the truth of the theory which makes relations as' real ' as qualities has been demonstrated. It has not. Its acceptancecomes about, necessarily, through softer, metaphysical considerations. But even with all this said, a problem remains. W have talked e uncritically, at some length, in the rst instance of qualities as being' real ', and later of relations, as well, as being ' real '. But what, exactly,might this mean? What are philosophers saying when they say thatqualities are real and that relations are real? 9.3 Realism and its rivals; abstract and concrete entitiesThe concept of property encompasses both the concept of quality (or attribute) and the concept of relation. As understood here, a thing 's properties may include its being red (a quality), but also its standing in the two-place relation of being north of some second thing, as well as its standing in the three-place relation of being between two other things, etc. It is important to emphasize that properties - qualities and relations - are neither physical things themselves, nor parts of things. A piece of chalk, white though it is, is not literally whiteness itself. Neither isthe chalk 's whiteness a physical part of the chalk. Physical parts of material objects are themselves (smaller) physical parts and may intheir tur n be physically separated from the larger thing of which theyare parts. One might for example remove chips of chalk from a larger262 Beyond Experience piece of chalk. The chips are (or were) parts of the original chunk. But the property of whiteness is no part of that chunk. The whiteness can-not be removed so that we could then say: \" Here on the left is thewhiteness which used to be in the chalk, and here on the right is whatremains of the chalk, that is, the chalk with its whiteness removed. \"Or, to take a second example, imagine the impossibility of trying toremove the weight of the chalk: \" Here on the left is the weight of the chalk; and here on the right is what remains of the chalk with just itsweight and nothing more taken from it. \" Relations, too, are not partsof things. John may be taller than Bill; but the relation of being taller than is neither part of John nor part of Bill. In short, properties - qualities and relations - are not parts of things. But if properties arenot parts, what, then, might they be? The one feature of properties which is universally acknowledged is that properties are general. Although only one thing in the world may happen to exhibit, for example, some specic shade of blue, there isnothing in principle preventing any number of other things from alsoexhibiting that specic shade of blue. And similarly for any otherproperty: zero, or one, or two ... or countless numbers of things maybe square; zero, or one, or two ... or countless numbers of pairs maystand in the relation of being friendly with ; etc. This distinction between, on the one hand, particulars* - individual things, such aspersons, places, times, or material objects - and, on the other, theirqualities and relations is acknowledged to be perhaps the most fun- damental distinction in our conceptual scheme. But what account are we to give of the relationship between par- ticulars and their properties? Plato struggled mightily with this prob-lem throughout his lifelong philosophical writings. Every theory headvanced he was soon to realize was beset with difculties. And hisown experience was to presage virtually every successor 's. The prob-lem has tur ned out to be the most enduring of all philosophicalpuzzles. T day, more than two thousand years later, no theory has o won anything like universal acceptance; indeed there is probably noth-ing that can even be called the ' received ' account. These are the data Plato believed had to be accounted for in a theo- ry of properties: (1) two or more existing things can share the sameproperty; (2) properties (e.g. the property of being square) are notparts of things; and (3) properties can exist without anything instanc- ing that property (e.g. squareness would exist even if nothing in theworld happened to be square). The last of these three claims is themost problematic and is the one most often challenged. Whether orProperties 263 not one subscribes to this last claim will determine whether one opts, like Plato, for a so-called Realist theory of properties or for a non-Realist theory. Why might one think that each property exists even if nothing hap- pens to bear that property? Why, for example, might one believe thatsquareness exists in a world where nothing whatsoever is square? Consider the sentence: \" Everything is such that it is not square \" (or more idiomatically, \" Nothing is square \"). Although this sentence hap-pens to express a false proposition, we can perfectly well conceivethat what is being claimed could have been true . It is not necessary that the universe contain square things; it just happens to be a contin-gent truth that it does. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that therenever were any square things in the universe at any time, past, present,or future. The proposition under examination - that everything is such 16that it is not square - would then be true. But how could it be true?F r on the face of it, it would seem to be referring to two quite differ-o ent concepts, that of every (existing) thing and that of the property squareness . The concept of squareness must refer to something or other. But, by hypothesis, it cannot be referring to the property of any actually existing thing. Therefore, in some sense, squareness wouldhave to ' exist ' even if nothing whatsoever at any place or any time inthe universe happened to be square. Although the foregoing argument is not Plato 's, but a more moder n version of the reasoning leading to his conclusions, Plato argued thatthe properties of things must exist ' independently ' of those things. Butwhat might this mean? If the properties of things exist independentlyof those things, what are we to make of the nature of this ' existence '? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16. Having never experienced anything which was square, perhaps persons may never come to for mulate and entertain either the proposition that thingsmight be square or the proposition that nothing is square. But what proposi-tions persons for mulate and subsequently come either to believe or to dis-believe is irrelevant to whether those propositions are true or false. There areinnumerable propositions which we never for mulate, still less do we haveopinions about their truth or falsity. And there probably are countless num-bers of propositions which we are incapable of considering, if for no otherreason than that their constituent concepts lie outside the conceptual capac-ities of human beings (see pp. 84-5 above). The point is that a propositionsuch as that nothing is square does not depend on human beings ' beliefs;even more strongly, it does not depend even on there being human beings orany conscious creatures.264 Beyond Experience Physical objects - things which are actually square, blue, etc. - exist in both space and time. If their properties are hypothesized toexist, but neither as parts of objects nor as physical objects them-selves, then - it would seem reasonable to maintain - they must existoutside of space and time. On purely combinatorial grounds, there are four possibilities: (1) something exists both in space and in time; (2) something exists intime, but not in space; (3) something exists in space, but not in time;and (4) something exists neither in space nor in time. Physical objects,including human beings, exist in space and time. They are said to be' spatiotemporal ' objects or existents. Are there any ' things ' in any ofthe other three categories? Does anything exist outside of space and / or of time? I am not quite sure, but perhaps some religions have posited a god who exists in time, but not in space. But I must confess ignorance onthis score. In any event, some philosophers have argued that mindssatisfy this second category, i.e. they have advanced the theory thatminds exist only in time but not in space. G.E. Moore counterargued,however, that from the difculty of attributing some particular length,width, and depth to minds, it does not follow that minds are not in 17space: \" ... our acts of consciousness ... occur in the same places in which our bodies are. ... When ... I travelled up to W terloo by train, a I believe that my mind and my acts of consciousness travelled withme. When the train and my body were at Putney, I was thinking andseeing at Putney. When the train and my body reached Clapham Junc-tion, I was thinking and seeing at Clapham Junction. ... My acts ofconsciousness take place in my body; and yours take place in yours:and our minds (generally, at least) go with us, wherever our bodiesgo \" ([137], 19-20). Is there anything which might plausibly be regarded as falling into the third category, i.e. of things in space but not in time? Offhand, Icannot think of a single example where a philosopher has proposedsuch a thing. I know of no alleged examples of things which are sup-posedly spatial but are not temporal. Of course one can neglect tomention a spatial object 's temporal extent. One could talk about thegeographical features of P ris without ever mentioning at what time a they happened to exist. But failing to mention their time of existence \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 17. Moore seems to be echoing here a similar argument in Locke. See [124], book I I, chap. X X I I I, \u00a7\u00a718-20.Properties 265 does not make them nontemporal objects. The Champs Elys \u00b4 es has e temporal existence even if one happens to neglect it in describing thatboulevard. The fourth category, that of objects which are neither spatial nor temporal, is the focus of the most intense controversy in this scheme.F r it is here that followers of Plato, \" Realists \" as they have come too be known, will assign properties. Objects which are neither spatial nortemporal, which lie ' outside ' of both space and time, are known as' abstract objects '. Objects which lie within space and time, e.g. thispage you are reading, your body, the planet Earth, the Sun, or theMilky W y, are known as ' concrete ' objects. Concrete objects havea 18spatiotemporal positions. There is a certain irony in the name \" Realism \". Philosophers who argue for Realism, i.e. the theory that properties ' really ' exist outsideof space and time, seem to be bucking ordinary notions of what is' real '. In the ordinary way of invoking the concept of reality, onewould be inclined to identify reality with spatiotemporal existents,i.e. with concrete objects. But by a curious twist of history, the name\" Realism \" has been attached to the theory that abstract objects are' real '. (Sometimes vocabulary, other than that adopted here, is used tolabel abstract objects. Sometimes in place of \" abstract \", the ter m\" subsistent \" is used. And some philosophers prefer to use the verbs\"subsist\" or \"have being\" in place of \"exist\" in the case of abstract \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 18. Sometimes we tend to view ' the entire universe ' as the class of all the things it contains; othertimes as a kind of super-object, a gigantic scattered object of the sort we discussed earlier on p. 195. But can this latter mega- object, the entire universe, itself have a place? a time? If we try to persistwith the relational theories of space and of time advanced in the precedingchapter, and if we were to try to say where or when the entire universe exists, wouldn 't we be illicitly supposing that there was something else - out- side of the universe - which stood in some spatial or temporal relation to it? Ithink we need not be too troubled over this difculty. Once again we can usethe techniques of section 8.8. Just as we can say where the Mississippi Riveris located in space by specifying where its spatial parts are (it is at Memphis,Vicksburg, Natchez, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, etc.), we can say where theentire universe is: it is simply where any of its spatial parts are. Similarly, itexists in time whenever any of its temporal parts exist. Thus the entireuniverse can be regarded as a spatiotemporal object and there is no need toposit anything in space and time outside of the universe.266 Beyond Experience entities in order to contrast their ' manner of existence ' from that of objects which are in space and time.) Having posited that properties are outside of space and time, i.e. are abstract entities, a Realist is posed a formidable problem. Platoquickly realized this. At various times, he proposed a variety of alter-native explanations. At one point he thought that these abstract entities(squareness, justice, etc.) - \" for ms \" he called them (their moremoder n name is \" universals \"*) - were perfect particulars of which theconcrete existents, the spatiotemporal objects, were somehow imper-fect ' copies '. But he recognized that no such account could be madeto work. If blueness itself were a particular, the sort of thing whichmight be copied, then it itself would have to have the property of blue-ness, and one would merely have deferred the problem, not havesolved it; one would in fact thus have an innite regress. If particulars are not copies of universals, perhaps they ' participate ' or somehow ' share in ' the universal. But this notion is mere metaphor.W understand how two children might share a toy: by both handlinge it at the same time or by taking tur ns. Or, again, persons might par-ticipate in a stock offering or own a share in a company: they have alegal right to certain assets or prots. But there is only so much of thecompany to go around. Sharing cannot go on indenitely; eventuallythe asset runs out, or at the very least, each ' sharer ' gets a steadilydiminished portion. But universals do not ' run out ': any number ofthings can be blue without in the slightest detracting from the bluenessof other things. All attempts to explicate the relation obtaining between universals and particulars (i.e. their instances) in ter ms of other, more familiarrelations have proved equally insupportable. W can give a name to e the relation obtaining between a particular and its properties, i.e. wewill say that the particular ' instances ' or ' exemplies ' certain univer-sals, but we seem unable to explicate the relationship any further. Itseems, so far at least, after two thousand years of philosophers ' trying,to have eluded explication. It seems, so far, to be wholly sui generis *. Some persons nd the theory of universals exceedingly attractive. They take delight in positing another ' world ', a world of abstractobjects outside of space and time. T have found the need for such a o posit appears to persons of this temperament to be one of the great tri-umphs of metaphysics. But, equally, there are persons of the contrarytemperament who regard the positing of a world of abstract entitiesas the greatest blot possible in metaphysics and try, with enor mouseffort, to construct theories which have no need to posit such strangeProperties 267 entities. These latter, anti-Realist, theorists typically take one of three approaches. They will try to construct either a Conceptualist theory, aNominalist theory, or a theory positing the existence of what havecome to be called ' tropes '. Conceptualists attempt to argue that there are no abstract entities, 19that certain items in our minds - our conceptions of squareness, extension, etc. - are all we need posit in order to explain such facts asthat two or more objects may share the same property. But making theanalysis depend on the existence of conscious creatures has one imme-diate consequence which is wholly unacceptable to most contempo-rary philosophers: it makes it impossible for things to bear propertiesin worlds in which there are no minds. Few philosophers are disposedto make the existence of the world depend on the existence of us. The favored moder n belief strongly seems to be that a world could existdevoid of consciousness. There may be conscious creatures in thisworld, but there did not have to be . It would still have been a world, even if we had never existed. The preferred anti-Realist approaches today are through Nominal- ism and through the Theory of tropes. Nominalists argue that the only things that exist, that are ' real ', are individuals. There are no entities existing (subsisting) independentlyof individuals, i.e. nothing exists outside of space and time. Square-ness, for example, might be explicated by invoking either the class ofsquare things or - in some accounts - the complex individual (or scat- 20tered object ) which just is all the square things in the universe. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 19. Conceptions are not to be confused with concepts . What sorts of things concepts are is a question which has prompted a great diversity of replies. Above (p. 97) I gave only a minimal characterization of concept, one which was (deliberately) silent on the question concer ning what sorts of thingsconcepts are. But conceptions allow for a slightly fuller characterization. Whatever nal account we might want to give of concepts and conceptions - their ontological status and their relations one to another - we can say at theoutset (pre-analytically) that conceptions are in the mind . F r there to be ao conception of, let us say, blueness, there must be a mind (or consciousness) which ' has ' or ' entertains ' that conception. Conceptions are ' mental entities ';concepts may, or may not, be in the mind. (Many, perhaps most, currentaccounts lean toward treating concepts as non-mental entities.) 20. See p. 195 and footnote 18, p. 265 above. W will retur n, again, to this e notion of a ' complex individual ' in chapter 11, p. 334.268 Beyond Experience Three problems beset Nominalism. If properties are to be explicated in ter ms of classes of similar individuals, then it would seem thatNominalism has dispensed with one sort of abstract entity, viz. univer-sals, only to persist with another, viz. classes. F r, in most standard o accounts, classes are themselves abstract entities. But even allowingfor classes, another problem arises. If redness, for example, is to beexplicated by invoking the class of all red things, then the members ofthis class are members in virtue of their being similar to another (in respect of their color). But then the relation of similarity (or resemblance ) would seem to be an irreducible property, i.e. one not capable of being explicated solely in ter ms of some class of things.And nally there is the aforementioned problem of unsatised (orunactualized) properties. According to Nominalism, if there were, forexample, no actual squares, then squareness would be identied withthe null (i.e. empty) class. But similarly, if there were no actualcircles, then circularity, too, would be identied with the null class.Thus, in a world where there were neither squares nor circles, bothsquareness and circularity would be identied with the same, viz. theempty, class. Nominalists believe that none of these objections is fataland that each can be met in a well-crafted theory. But, in the mean-time, another anti-Realist theory has been attracting attention. I began this section by saying that the properties of material things are not parts of things, in the sense that they are not themselves material things. But if properties are not parts, then - according to this third anti-Realist theory - they are very much more like parts thanthey have earlier been regarded. Donald Williams, who is generallycredited for resurrecting this theory in the 1960s (elements of the theo-ry were current in the 1920s and 1930s), argued that the properties ofspecic individuals, e.g. the redness and sphericity of some particularlollipop (not redness and sphericity ' in general '), are - if not exactlyparts, then at least - ' components ' ([214]). (Williams sometimescalled these components \" subtle \", \" thin \", \" diffuse \", or \" ne \" parts.See, for example, [214], 76.) In any event, he labeled individual prop-erties further, dropping explicit reference to their being either ' parts ' 21or ' components ', by introducing the technical ter m \" tropes \". \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 21. Williams appropriated the word, but not the meaning, from George San- tayana ([184]). His justication for assigning a new meaning was somewhatimperious: \" I shall divert the word, which is almost useless in either his [San-tayana 's] or its dictionary sense \" ([214], 78). Williams also used the expres-Properties 269 I propose now that entities like our ne parts [i.e. tropes] ... are the primary constituents of this or any possible world ... Theynot only are actual but are the only actualities, in just this sense,that whereas entities of all other categories are literally com-posed of them, they are not in general composed of any othersort of entity. (78) That things consist of tropes does not imply either that they were made by putting tropes together or that they can be dis-mantled by taking tropes apart. (98) There are, then, in this scheme no universals of the sort posited by Realists, i.e. there is no universal redness instanced in this lollipop andin that lollipop. There is rather the particular redness of this lollipopand the particular redness of that lollipop. But certain problems areseemingly solved only to leave others unsolved, and perhaps even in aworse state. Once again relations seem to pose a formidable challenge. There is a powerful attraction in the theory of tropes when the examples (Wil-liams 's own) are of such qualities as redness, sphericity, and aridity.But the theory seems less attractive when one tur ns to relations, suchproperties as ...-is-to-the-left-of-... and ...-is-between-...-and-... . The particular redness of a specic lollipop can plausibly be argued to becoextensive* with the lollipop itself, i.e. it can plausibly be argued thatredness of a particular lollipop is - like the lollipop itself - an individ-ual (more exactly, a trope) having spatiotemporal properties. But whatabout that lollipop 's being on the table? Is being on a trope which is a ' component ' (a ' thin part ' in Williams 's terminology) of the pair ofobjects, the lollipop and the table? Neither Williams originally (1966)nor Keith Campbell, who promoted the theory in the 1970s ([41]),addressed how, exactly, relations were supposed to be accommodatedwithin the theory of tropes. It is only more recently that Campbell \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 sion \" abstract particulars \" as a synonym for \" tropes \" adding, however, that this \" good old phraseology has a paradoxical ring \" (78). Since Williams used\" abstract \" in a way quite different from that adopted in this book, I will scru-pulously avoid adopting the expression \" abstract particular \". \" Theory of tropes \" should not be abbreviated as \" tropism \". \" Tropism \" is a ter m too well entrenched in biology, where it has a distinct technical use, tobe protably co-opted for use in philosophy.270 Beyond Experience has tried to adapt the theory to this vexing problem (see e.g. [42]). His current approach recapitulates some of the techniques we haveexplored earlier (in section 9.2.6) by which philosophers have tried toeliminate relations in favor of (monadic) qualities. There is another problem as well: Plato 's problem of the One and the Many. In a theory of tropes, how is it possible for two or moreconcrete particulars to ' share the same property in common ', e.g. fortwo or more individuals (my apple, your tomato, and her scarf ) all tobe red? At the rst level of analysis the answer is clear: each of themhas as a component, i.e. has as a trope, its own individual redness. Butwhat makes each of these tropes the ' same ' trope? Plato 's originalproblem - asked of physical things themselves - retur ns with an evengreater sting as a problem about tropes. What makes two tropessimilar? The trouble now is, however, that we cannot say that they, theparticular tropes, share some trope in common. W have just seen that e Williams has insisted that tropes \" are not in general composed of anyother sort of entity \". In a way, the very problem that the positing oftropes was supposed to forestall has itself reappeared to infect thattheory itself. One proposal which has been made is that the similarityof two (or more) tropes, e.g. the similarity of this red trope to that one,is an ' irreducible brute fact '. But such an explanation - to philoso-phers who have not themselves adopted the theory - seems moreof a resolute avoidance of the difculty than a satisfactory solution.Like the Nominalists with their earlier theory, those philosophers wholately posit tropes as a way to avoid Realism believe that the problemswithin their theory are not insuperable. Although I generally prefer negative theories - those which posit as 22few unempirical concepts* as possible - my own leanings in this 23particular case are toward Realism. My attraction to the theory is \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22. F r denition of \" unempirical concept \" in Glossary, see under \" empiri-o cal \". 23. I was surprised to nd in Steven Goldman 's combined review of my book The Concept of Physical Law ([201]) and of David Ar mstrong 's What Is a Law of Nature? ([13]) that he has characterized me as being a Nominal- ist: \" S arz [sic] argues a nominalist position in which particular events, inw virtue of being all there is to reality, are both logically and ontologically priorto universals \" ([79], 97). Goldman has obviously read something into mybook that is not there at all. Nowhere in that book do I even raise the matterof Realism versus Nominalism. And while I certainly did argue that par-Properties 271 bolstered by one further consideration: I can see no way to account for the existence of certain items, e.g. pieces of music, plays, and novels,other than by conceiving of them as abstract entities. Here I am con-siderably influenced by the arguments of C.E.M. Joad (1891-1953).Joad argued ([105], 267-70) that the play Hamlet, for example, could not reasonably be identied with any particular in the world: neither 24with an idea in Shakespeare 's mind, nor with any manuscript hewrote, nor with any printed edition of the text, nor with any particularproduction, nor with any audio or video recording of any particularproduction. F r Hamlet could exist even if any one or several of these o were not to exist. While Joad, himself, rightly expressed some dif-dence about his own arguments, I think that they add considerableimpetus to a theory which would posit abstract entities. Although I am a Realist, I am a reluctant Realist. F r, to be frank, o there is something exceedingly peculiar about positing entities whichexist (subsist) outside of space and time. I, personally, would prefer atheory which could dispense with such mysterious entities. But I ndthe problems inherent in the various anti-Realist theories even more \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ticular events are logically prior to physical laws, I never argued, nor do I believe, that physical events are logically prior to universals. If anything, Ibelieve precisely the opposite. I suspect that Goldman 's mistaken charac-terization of my position arises out of my having staked out a position con-trary to Ar mstrong 's. Ar mstrong believes that there are ontically necessaryrelations obtaining between universals; I do not believe that there are. Butthis does not mean that I deny that there are universals. I deny only that thereexist ontically necessary relationships between them. I regard myself as mucha Realist about universals as Ar mstrong. While both of us are Realists, he is aNecessitarian and I am a Regularist. 24. The expression \" idea in someone 's mind \" is ambiguous. Sometimes when we use this expression, we refer to some particular idea on some par-ticular occasion, in effect, to some act of thought which is (at least) some temporal particular. Othertimes in using this expression we refer to an ideawhich other persons may share. If so, then we are talking of a universal. Notethat if we mean by \" an idea in Shakespeare 's mind \" some particular act ofthought, then insofar as Shakespeare is now dead, that act is now as nonexist-ent as any of his pains or his visual sensations of the English countryside. If,however, by \" idea in his mind \" we mean something which could be sharedby other persons, which could exist as well in other persons ' minds, then weare talking of a universal, and that would not be to deny Joad 's argument, butto concur with it.272 Beyond Experience troubling. Realism is simply the better, in my estimation, of the avail- able theories. But, like many other Realists, I do not much care forRealism. Recently one of my colleagues professed his repudiation ofRealism by saying that he found the positing of abstract entities \" unin-telligible \". I share his displeasure. But I nd myself unable to adopthis own anti-Realist position because I cannot in tur n believe that theanti-Realist theories provide any better answer or that they can be de-veloped without themselves having to posit at least some abstractentities. The debate between the Realists and the anti-Realists, we may be sure, will continue for some time. And we may equally be sure thatpassions will flare. Some years ago I was present at a conference where Bas van Fraas- sen spoke about the problems in positing, or abstaining from positing,abstract entities - in particular, sets - in mathematics. He began histalk (which he subsequently published) with the following two para-graphs: 25Once upon a time there were two possible worlds, Oz and Id.These worlds were very much alike and, indeed, very muchlike our world. Specically, their inhabitants developed exactlythe mathematics and mathematical logic we have today. Themain differences were two: (a) in Oz, sets really existed, and inId no abstract entities existed, but (b) in Id, mathematicians andphilosophers were almost universally Platonist, while in Ozthey refused, almost to a man, to believe that there existed anyabstract entities. They all lived happily ever after. ([207], 39) In his nal paragraph, he added: I am not arguing that there are no sets. First, it is philosoph- ically as uninteresting whether there are sets as whether thereare unicor ns. As a philosopher I am only interested in whetherour world is intelligible if we assume that there are no sets, andwhether it remains equally intelligible if we do not. P rsonally, e I delight in the postulation of occult entities to explain everydayphenomena, I just don 't delight in taking it seriously. As a phi- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 25. Doubtless further homage to L. Frank Baum. See p. 207 above.Properties 273 losopher, however, I look forward to the day when we shall be able to say, \" Y s, Virginia, there is a null set, \" and go on to e explain, as the New Y rk Sun did of Santa Claus, that of courseo there isn 't one, but still there really is, living in the hearts andminds of men - exactly what a conceptualist by temperamentwould hope. ([207], 50) Some of van Fraassen 's listeners were amused by his fable. But at least one, Reinhardt Grossmann, a dear teacher of mine from graduateschool, was not. Indeed, Grossmann was outraged. Several times hewas heard to protest, \" How can he believe it makes no difference?There is all the difference between abstract entities really existing andtheir not. \" As I said, the debate continues.It is now time to apply the concepts explored in these last two sec- tions to the problem introduced at the outset of this chapter, viz.whether qualitative identity - the sharing of all properties in common- confers numerical identity.C H A P T E R T E N Individuation In the previous chapter we previewed the topic of this current chapter: How are we to account for the possibility of there being numericallydistinct things which are qualitatively identical? If two or more thingsare qualitatively identical, i.e. share their properties in common, whatthen accounts for their multiplicity? T be able to pursue such a ques- o tion has required us to devote virtually all of chapter 9 to an examina-tion of the concept of sharing properties in common . 10.1 Physical objectsOne of the facts of our experience, perhaps the most familiar, is that the world contains an enormous number of physical objects. It may, aswell, contain many other kinds of things, e.g. minds, souls, numbers,universals, and forces. But we will conne our attention in the earlierparts of this chapter principally to physical objects. Ordinarily we do not much wonder about the commonplace. It is the unusual, the out-of-routine, the unfamiliar, which stands out anddemands our attention. One may wonder how it is possible, if indeedit is, that extrasensory perception might occur, or that certain humanbeings can walk on bur ning coals, or that the influenza virus of1918-19 which killed 20 million persons disappeared as abruptly as ithad initially appeared. But few persons would be similarly tempted towonder about something as familiar and commonplace as the exist-ence of material objects. And yet, when one does think about materialobjects, the more one thinks about them, the more mysterious theyseem. First of all there is the most basic question of all: Why is there something, rather than nothing? Many persons are tempted to give atheological answer: God has created the world. But that answer onlyraises another: Why did God create the world? There is no satisfactoryanswer forthcoming from rational theology. V rious religions may aIndividuation 275 offer answers; but religious answers are, more often than not, glar- ingly decient when judged on the grounds of rational theology andare usually terribly unconvincing to persons who do not share thesame religious orientation. Some moder n thinkers, adopting what they have called \" the an- thropic principle \", have tur ned the question and its answer roundabout, arguing that unless there were a world, complete with materialobjects, we could not even ask the question \" Why does anythingexist? \" While the claim is undeniably true, many critics object that it 1does not provide a satisfactory answer to the question. It is analogousto someone 's answering the question \" Why does Joan love classicalmusic? \" by replying that if Joan 's mother had not become pregnantthen Joan would not have been bor n and hence would not have lovedclassical music. Although Joan 's mother becoming pregnant was anecessary condition for Joan 's being bor n and hence a necessarycondition for Joan 's liking classical music, neither of these events (orstates) - Joan 's mother becoming pregnant and Joan 's liking classicalmusic - critics will insist, explains the other. Similarly, if the worlddid not exist, none of us could ask why it does; but neither of theseevents (states) - the world 's existing and our asking why it does - 2critics will insist, explains the other. Although I have read what a great variety of writers have had to say on this subject, I have never found an answer which has had (for me) a \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. The anthropic principle has received considerable attention in the last two decades, both in academic circles (see, e.g., [22] for a sustained defense, and[62] for a criticism - the latter contains a good bibliography) and in thepopular media (see, e.g., [74]). But it is not a new principle by any means. Itspromoters advance it explicitly as a resurrecting of the teleology of ancientand medieval science (again see [22]). It is a specialized version of the verysort of principle which Bacon, as we have earlier seen (p. 58), was intent todispel from physics nearly four hundred years ago. As I explained, thearguments for and against adopting such principles cannot be decided byexperimental science. These are metaphysical principles which require us toexamine the very core of our conception of what a satisfactory model ofexplanation may be. I, like Bacon, regard such principles, whether in theirold-fashioned guise or in their latest raiment, as inappropriate within physicsand cosmology. But, clearly, other writers do not share this view. 2. Even more recently (1984), Nicholas Rescher has taken a new departure and has pursued a boldly speculative proposal: that certain very basic physi-cal laws (laws of Nature) - \"protolaws\" he calls them - necessitate the exist-276 Beyond Experience signicant degree of plausibility. I have become steadily more con- vinced that the question is ill-conceived. It is as ill-conceived as, forexample, one way of posing the question \" Where is the universe? \"One can, as I suggested earlier (footnote 18, p. 265), answer the latterquestion by saying (fairly uninfor matively): \" It is where any of itsspatial parts are. \" But one cannot, of course, rationally demand ananswer which species where the universe is in relation to somethingoutside of the universe. Similarly, one can explain why some specic event occurs in the history of the universe by citing antecedent events(and - depending on one 's theories of historical explanation - pos-sibly historical laws, generalizations, or truisms as well). But one can- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ence of material objects; and that the truth of these protolaws, themselves, comes about through their maximizing certain ' cosmic values ' ([170]). Thereare two forbidding hurdles lying in the path of this solution. The rst problem lies in the exceptional role assigned to the protolaws. In virtually all contemporary accounts, physical laws state the relationshipsbetween existent or possible entities; but they do not ' require ' or ' necessitate 'the existence of those entities. That is, physical laws are regarded as beinglogically conditional, not categorical, i.e. as not implying the existence of their subjects. F r example, the law which states that an isolated planet and a o star will revolve around a common focus in elliptical orbits is, in fact, neverrealized. There are no fully isolated planetary systems anywhere in the uni-verse. Physical laws state (conditionally) \" such and such would happenif ... \"; they do not state (categorically) \" such and such actually exists and behaves thus ... \" So we see that Rescher 's hypothesized protolaws would beconsiderably different from ' ordinary ' physical laws. T explain the existence o of material objects, they would have to be an ontologically different kind ofthing than familiar physical laws. W would have, as it were, two ' tiers ' of e physical laws. The second difculty arises from Rescher 's suggestion that the protolaws maximize certain ' cosmic values ' (' cosmic ' in that these values have nothingto do with human concer ns, i.e. are not ethical, aesthetic, etc.). W are not, e however, given an example of any of these cosmic values, and hence are inno position to judge whether they can explain protolaws. But we cananticipate certain severe problems. Insofar as these cosmic values are furthercharacterized as being self-justicatory, it is highly improbable that theycould serve as the explanatory basis of protolaws which include, Reschersuggests, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the like. It is difcult, ifnot impossible, to imagine self-justifying cosmic values with the kind ofspecicity needed to explain why quantum mechanics rather than a logicallypossible, but incompatible, alter native should be true.Individuation 277 not extrapolate indenitely and think that one can ask meaningfully why the universe as a whole exists. Just as there is nothing outside ofthe universe against which the spatial position of the entire universemay be gauged, there are no events outside of the universe whoseoccurrence can be rationally posited as explaining the existence of theuniverse. This conclusion may seem overly pessimistic. Many of us hate to think that our understanding must be limited. But the world providesno guarantee of its being fully comprehensible. Given how we stand-ardly explain events and states, it seems to me that we are positivelyprecluded from being able to for mulate an intelligible answer to thequestion \" Why is there anything, rather than nothing? \" The only pos-sible reply must be: \" W cannot answer such a question. It can have e 3no answer. \" I take it as a datum that the universe exists and that it has material objects in it. T be sure, some philosophers - in the two thousand o years of written philosophy - have challenged even this assumption. Ihave no particular desire here to recount their arguments. As I havesaid (p. 240), I do not think that there can be any conclusive refutationof their theories. But I do believe that the contrary posit, that there arematerial objects, is rationally supportable. In any event, I am suf-ciently comfortable with it that I am perfectly happy to accept it as aworking hypothesis if for no other reason than to get on to what I dowant to examine. (If this latter claim strikes you as evidencing anexcessive tentativeness, let me state explicitly that I r mly believe thatthere are material objects. It is just that I am not interested here in making a diversion into a discussion of what, for most persons,requires no justication whatsoever.) There are material objects - this is the starting point for this chap- ter. I do not ask why there are material objects. But I do want to ask \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. Robert Nozick strongly rejects this pessimistic verdict. But he cautions that very odd theories will have to be generated. Characterizing his own theo-ries (1981), he writes: \" The question cuts so deep, however, that any ap-proach that stands a chance of yielding an answer will look extremely weird.Someone who proposes a non-strange answer shows he didn 't understandthis question. Since the question is not to be rejected, though, we must beprepared to accept strangeness or apparent craziness in a theory whichanswers it \" ([146], 116).278 Beyond Experience how it is possible that there are material objects. The two questions are very different. Physical objects, material things, in spite of their familiarity tur n out to be conceptually puzzling. What accounts for the numerical dis-tinctness of material objects? W might discover, in due course, that e this question, too, just like the ones I dismissed a moment ago, may beunanswerable; it may be ill-conceived in ways unapparent at the out-set. But whether this is so remains to be seen. W must make an e attempt to answer it. In that attempt we must be prepared for one pos-sibility: discovering that our initial question was ill-conceived and theenterprise we have embarked upon must eventuate in frustration. Butwe cannot decide this in advance. ' Nothing ventured, nothing gained 'is true; unfortunately, its positive counterpart ' Something ventured,something gained ' may be false. Without making the attempt, we willgain nothing. However, in making the attempt, we are not assured ofany success. W are not even entitled to the belief that success is pos- e sible, still less that it is probable. 10.2 Identity-at-a-time versus identity-through-timeIt has become customary to break the question of the numerical iden- tity of physical objects into two stages. W begin (in this chapter) with e the question of the numerical identity of objects at some givenmoment of time. This might be called ' snapshot ' identity. F r o example, we might ask, \" Is the book I am now looking at the selfsamebook you are now looking at? \" This is ' momentary ' or ' instan-taneous ' identity. That is, this is identity which disregards the fact, if itis a fact, that the ' things ' being identied may also happen to endurethrough time. The instantaneous aspect of the identication is perhapsbetter expressed in a formal statement. The question we will be intentto pursue may be for mulated this way: Under what conditions may O -at-T be regarded as being 1 1 numerically identical with O -at-T ?2 1 Identity-at-a-time is often spoken of as ' synchronic identity ' and equally as ' individuation '. It is easy to see why the concept of individ-uation is invoked in this context: to specify the conditions underwhich O and O are numerically identical (or distinct) is just to 12 specify the conditions under which O is (or is not) to be regarded as1 being the same individual as O . T specify conditions of numericalo2 identity just is to specify the conditions of individuation.Individuation 279 Having once addressed the question how numerical identity, or in- dividuation, is to be accounted for at some specic moment of time,one can then go on to ask how identity-through-time might be ex-plained. The latter question presupposes an answer to the for mer.Objects must be individuated - i.e. we must be able to pick out indi-vidual objects - before we can hope to be able to trace their evolutionthrough time. Thus we will separate the two problems, tackling in-dividuation (or synchronic identity) in this chapter and identity-through-time (or diachronic identity) in the next. 10.3 P sitive and negative theories of individuationo Attempts at solving the problem of individuation divide into two dis- tinct classes: those which argue that what individuates objects is theirproperties; and those which argue that properties alone can never indi-viduate objects, and hence which nd it necessary to posit something' beyond ' or ' behind ' an object 's properties, a special ' individuator ',viz. its ' substance '. Theories which attempt to solve the individuationproblem by invoking nothing more than a thing 's properties are spoken of as ' negative ' theories. Negative theories are also sometimescolorfully called \" bundle theories \" since they argue that there is noth-ing more to a thing than its being (metaphorically) a ' bundle ' of prop-erties. Theories which try to solve the individuation problem by posit-ing that there is more (e.g. substance) to a thing than just its properties are said to be ' positive ' theories. Negative theorists will, like Leibniz, take as their point of departure the principle of the identity of indiscernibles (see p. 232 above), argu-ing that numerical identity can be accounted for strictly in ter ms of theproperties which things instance. In the previous chapter we intro-duced symbols for numerical identity and for qualitative identity. Theprinciple of the identity of indiscernibles may be stated in a spe-cialized version for identity-at-a-time: (O -at-T Q O -at-T ) (O -at-T = O -at-T ) 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 This principle states that O is numerically identical to O at some par-12 ticular moment of time if, at that moment of time, O and O share all1 2 their properties in common. The philosophical task confronting the negative, or bundle, theorists then becomes one of examining underwhat conditions this principle might tur n out to be true. Questions of numerical identity are interchangeable with questions of numerical difference. F r, if we can state under what conditions O o 1280 Beyond Experience and O are numerically identical, then we have also stated, implicitly,2 under what conditions O and O are numerically distinct. Simply: O1 2 1 and O will be numerically distinct when the conditions for their being2 numerically identical do not obtain. Thus we may interchange the two questions at will. This explains why we often nd theorists, both thosepromoting a negative theory and those promoting a positive theory,focusing their attention on examples of numerical difference as readilyas on numerical identity. From a psychological point of view, it maybe somewhat easier to focus on numerical difference than on numeri-cal identity. But both approaches are equally valid. 10.4 The metaphysical and epistemological dimensions of the problem of individuation There are two quite distinct, although closely allied, problems of indi- viduation. On the one side, there is the metaphysical problem. What must we assume about physical things themselves in order to account for their numerical distinctness? If possible, we want this answer not to invokeany special perceptual or cognitive abilities of conscious creaturessince we can readily imagine possible worlds in which there are dis-tinct physical objects and yet which do not contain any consciouscreatures. W should no more want to make the numerical distinctness e of physical objects depend on some feature or capacity of conscious,perceiving, knowing creatures than we should want, for example, tomake the charge on an electron, or the mass of a proton, or the speedof light depend on some fact about us. On the other side, there is the epistemological problem. W human e beings can and regularly do individuate objects, i.e. we are able to dis- tinguish them one from another, and we can even count objects (in 4stipulated regions of space and intervals of time). How are we able to do this? What is there about physical objects and about us whichallows us to individuate them? Do we human beings have ' access 'to whatever it is which - metaphysically speaking - individuates ma-terial objects, or - somehow - do we individuate objects in some otherway? But if so, how? It is a regrettable fact about English that we use the same word \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. Our being able to count objects is often taken as equivalent to our being able to individuate objects. See, for example, [217].Individuation 281 \" individuation \" both for the metaphysical basis of numerical differ- ence and for our human ability to discer n the multiplicity of things.W could, somewhat articially, deliberately avoid the verb \" individ-e uate \" in the latter case and take recourse instead to something like\" tell things apart \". But the trouble with that maneuver is that it is onlya temporary solution. Other writers standardly use \" individuation \" inboth senses, the metaphysical and the epistemological. W will follow e suit. But we must be aware that although we use a single word, thereare two different concepts at play. What we would like is a solution toboth problems of individuation, the metaphysical version and the epis-temological version. 10.5 P sitive theories: Substratum as individuatoro Certain ter ms in philosophy - \" for m \", \" principle \", \" substance \", etc. - have been in vogue for millennia, rst in Greek and Latin and, later, inEnglish translation, and have acquired a bewildering number of differ-ent meanings. \" Substance \", for example, occurs frequently in the writ-ings of Aristotle and is used there in no fewer than six different senses(see e.g. [147]). In this chapter and in each of the next two, we willinvoke respectively three different concepts of substance. In this chap-ter, we will examine whether substance need be posited to explainindividuation (identity-at-a-time); in the next chapter, whether sub-stance need be posited to explain identity-through-time; and in the lastchapter, whether substance need be posited in order to explain per-sonal identity. Of the many concepts of substance, the principal one for attention in this chapter is that which is sometimes called \" the substratum \".Although the concept is certainly not original with Locke, it was hisversion - or at least a version conventionally attributed to him - whichcame to gure prominently in later discussions and is the one whichmoder n philosophers most often have in mind when they talk of \" sub-stratum \". Locke offered this explanation as to why he thought it nec-essary to posit substance: ... when we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal 5[material] substances ... though the idea we have ... of them \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5. Locke, in this rst instance, is not using \" substance \" in his own technical sense, but in the colloquial or ordinary sense, in which one might talk, for282 Beyond Experience be but the complication or collection of those several simple ideas of sensible qualities, which we ... nd united in the thing ...; yet, because we cannot conceive how they should subsistalone, nor one in another, we suppose them existing in and sup-ported by some common subject; which support we denote by the name substance , though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support. ([124], book I I, chap. X X I I I, \u00a74) ... not imagining how these simple ideas can subsist by them- selves, we accustom ourselves to suppose some substratum wherein they do subsist, and from which they do result, whichtherefore we call substance . (\u00a71) ... substance is supposed always something besides the exten- sion, gure, solidity, motion ... or other observable ideas, though we know not what it is. (\u00a73) This argument for the introduction of substance is a so-called argu- ment to the best solution: it argues for the existence of something onthe basis that that something must be posited as the best (if not theonly possible) solution of some puzzle. Substance, it is clear, becauseit is itself propertyless, could not possibly be known either by sense orby scientic experiment. Its existence is established, not by empiricalmeans, but - it is alleged - by rational means. As he originally introduces, and justies, the concept of substance , Locke does so for a particular purpose. The problem he is addressingin book I I, chap. X X I I I is that of trying to explain how the several properties of an individual thing occur at one place and do not seemseparable from one another. The properties of gold, \" yellowness, great 6weight, together in an unknown substratum \" ([124], \u00a737). This rst role for the concept of substance has, in more moder n times, come to be referred to as ' substance-as-ontological-glue '. Substance, in this \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 example, of gold as being a kind of substance or of water as being a kind of substance. His own examples are of horse and of stone. Roughly, this rst,ordinary, sense might be thought something akin to a natural kind of thing. 6. A mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acidsIndividuation 283 rst sense, is regarded as that ' stuff ' which ' binds together ' a thing 's properties and gives it its characteristic unity. F ur chapters later ( X X V I I ), however, Locke addresses a quite dif- o ferent set of problems, viz. those of individuation (although only verybriefly) and identity-through-time (at rather greater length). Again heinvokes the concept of substance in trying to solve the problems he is examining. But Locke seems - like so many other philosophers whohave taken recourse to the concept of substance - to overlook the factthat he is assigning a role to substance additional to its earlier one. F r o there is no logical connection whatever between the concepts of sub- stance-as-ontological-glue and of substance-as-individuator . That a thing 's substance ' binds together its properties ' does not imply thatthat substance also accounts for the thing 's numerical distinction fromother things. Indeed, even if one were disposed to be sympathetic tothe notion of substance, one could still ask: \" Is the ontological gluewhich holds together a thing 's properties the same substance or dis-tinct from that substance which accounts for that thing 's numericaluniqueness? \" T have solved the for mer problem is not only not to o have solved the latter problem, it is not even to have addressed it. W must, then, distinguish between substance-as-ontological-gluee and substance-as-individuator. It is only the latter which is of presentconcer n. Subsequent philosophers, most especially George Berkeley, found Locke 's concept of substance unacceptable. Contemporary philoso- phers (e.g. J.L. Mackie [128], chap. 3) are somewhat dubious aboutBerkeley 's objections, suggesting that perhaps Berkeley and manyother philosophers have misinterpreted Locke, that Locke was merelyreporting commonly held views and indeed may have been skepticalabout their cogency himself. These are questions of historical scholar-ship best left for another sort of book. Here we need merely askwhether a concept of substratum along the lines historically attributed to Locke will solve the problem of individuation. In a trivial sense itwill. F r so long as substance is described as being something \" I knowo not what \", then one can simply assign to it by at whatever is neededto solve the individuation problem. Substance, on this account,becomes the individuator by stipulative* denition. Two qualitativelyidentical things will be numerically distinct, on this account, becausetheir respective substances differ. It is of the essential nature of eachsubstance to be numerically distinct from every other substance. Whether or not they are tilting against a notion of substance which was uniquely Locke 's, or whether they are objecting to a notion which284 Beyond Experience is merely representative of a certain type of approach to solving the problem of individuation, a great many philosophers will eschew theconcept of substance-as-individuator and will try to solve the individ-uation problem without resorting to such a notion. The objections tosubstance-as-individuator are threefold. First is the fact that substance seems to be nothing more than an invented notion imbued with just those features needed to solve theproblem. From a purely explanatory point of view, the methodologyunderlying the introduction of the concept of substance is ineffective. It is as if one were to try to explain, for example, why opposite polesof magnets attract one another by saying that each pole has within it' an afnity for its opposite '. A new description has been given of thephenomenon, but nothing more by way of explanation. The second objection stems from the fact that inasmuch as sub- stance-as-individuator is essentially propertyless, i.e. its assigned roleis to lie ' behind ' or ' beneath ' the properties of a thing, then it is essen- 7tially undetectable by sense or by scientic instrument. It is as unem-pirical a concept as one can possibly dene. And third, and perhaps most signicantly, substance-as-individ- uator solves the metaphysical version of the individuation problem butnot the epistemological version. W can and do individuate physical e objects. And just as surely we do not perceive their substances. Wemust, then, be able to individuate physical objects on some other basis. If we can explain how we are able to do this, then perhaps we will have no need to posit substance-as-individuator. Whatever it iswhich allows us to individuate things perhaps might serve as well to account for the metaphysical numerical difference of things. 10.6 Negative theories: Qualities and relations as individuatorLeibniz 's attempted solution was a classic negative theory: he tried to solve the problem of individuation solely by recourse to the propertiesof things. His solution, recall ( p. 233), was that every thing whatso-ever has a set of properties unique to it, i.e. there are, as a matter of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7. The model of substance as lying ' beneath ' the qualities (the monadic properties) of a thing may have some minimal virtue in evoking certainsuggestive images, but it is hard to understand how substance might be sup-posed to ground the relations in which particulars stand.Individuation 285 fact, no qualitatively identical things in the universe. Although it is logically possible that there should be two or more qualitativelyidentical things, Leibniz argued that their existence would be incom-patible with God 's perfection. God sees to it that there are no qualita-tively identical things, that any two things, however much apparentlyalike, do in fact differ in some detail or other, i.e. that each thing con- sists of a unique bundle of properties. Apart from its unacceptable appeal to highly dubious theological principles to solve a metaphysical problem, there are two other flawsin Leibniz 's solution. The rst is that his solution, even if it were to beaccepted as the solution to the metaphysical version of the individ-uation problem, would not solve the epistemological version. F r the o undeniable fact is that we are often able to individuate items at a glance without taking cognizance of any particular differences in their qualities, let alone - as Leibniz would have it - differences, in someinstances, in their microscopic features. The second flaw is that Leib-niz conceived of ' qualitative identity ' and ' qualitative difference ' inter ms of monadic qualities alone. In dismissing the reality of dyadic (three-place), and higher-place relations (see sec-tion 9.2.6), cut himself off from a possible solution which hasattracted a great many contemporary negative theorists, viz. that whatindividuates physical things is not their qualities, but their relations. But before we tur n to examine relations as individuator (sections 10.6.2 and 10.6.3), we must examine some present-day attempts toargue, once again, for monadic qualities as individuator. 10.6.1 Relational properties; haecceity V rious recent philosophers have - like Leibniz - tried to argue thata the principle of the identity of indiscernibles is true. But they doso nowadays on the basis that the principle is logically necessary,eschewing any appeal whatever to theological principles about God 'sperfection, etc. Thomas F ster, for example, argues that two or more objects must o differ in some property or other ([73]). His arguments depend on hisclaim that so-called relational properties (see above p. 258), e.g.is-older-than-the-Eiffel-T wer or is-to-the-left-of- a, are bona de mo- o nadic qualities applying to single individuals and are not merelydisguised relations - e.g. is-older-than or is-to-the-left-of - holding286 Beyond Experience 8between ordered pairs* of individuals. (Remember, the terminology is a bit confusing. Relational properties are not relations: they are monadic qualities.) His argument may be summarized this way: Consider two numerically distinct objects, a and b, that are sep- arate from one another. Then a has the relational property (monadic quality) of being-separate-from- b. But if the prin- ciple of the identity of indiscernibles were not true, i.e. if itwere possible for two distinct things to have all properties in common, then b, too, would have to have the property of being-separate-from- b, i.e. of being separate from itself. But this latter condition is impossible; nothing can be separate fromitself. Thus the principle of the identity of indiscernibles is nec-essarily true and any two numerically distinct things must differ in their (monadic) properties. That is, qualitative identitybetween numerically distinct things is a logical impossibility. 9There are several objections to F ster 's argument. Chief among them o is his treating n-place relations as monadic qualities rather than as relations. Unlike F ster, some other philosophers have argued that it is logi-o cally possible for two or more numerically distinct things to share alltheir properties in common. Max Black, for example, has described aworld consisting solely of two numerically distinct, but qualitativelyidentical, iron spheres ([31]). According to Black, such a world islogically possible; according to F ster, such a world is not. o \" It all depends on what is meant by sharing all properties in com- mon \", we might say. If we allow that is-separate-from- b is a genuine quality (monadic property), then, of course, the two iron spheres mustdiffer in their properties, since sphere a will have this property, and sphere b will not have it, indeed it is impossible that b should have this property. On the other hand, if we insist that is-separate-from is a relation holding between two things, then - clearly - a stands in this relation to b; and b, in its tur n, stands in this very same relation to a. In an account, then, which resists treating n-place relations as relation- al properties (i.e. as monadic qualities), the two iron spheres - just as \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8. F r denition of \" ordered pair \" in Glossary, see under \" set \".o 9. F ster, himself, reviews some which I do not discuss. See [73].oIndividuation 287 Black hypothesizes - can share all qualities in common and can also share all n-place relations in common. The debate tur ns, then, on whether or not to allow so-called rela- tional properties (e.g. is-separate-from- b) to be regarded as qualities (monadic properties). The major thrust of philosophical writing overthe last century has been explicitly away from such a notion. SinceRussell 's initial forays into this area ([176.1]) in 1900, the theoryhas been that such relational properties as is-separate-from- b or is-west-of-T ronto should be regarded not as qualities instanced ino single particulars (e.g. a and Edmonton, respectively), but as disguised proxies for two-place relations instanced in ordered pairs of particu-lars, e.g. in the ordered pairs a, b and Edmonton, T ronto . (Wo e have earlier reviewed [section 9.2.6] the very considerable difcul- ties, insuperable perhaps, in trying to ' reduce ' relations to monadicqualities.) But even if there were not the pressures of logical considerations against F ster 's relational properties, there would remain the objectiono that such ' peculiar ' hybrid properties do not effectively solve the epis-temological version of the individuation problem. If two numericallydistinct physical objects, a and a , differ only in instancing, respec- 1 2 tively, such properties as being-separate-from- a and being-separate-2 from-a , it is very hard to see how we might take cognizance of such1 properties in discriminating between those objects. Suppose you were to take these objects, place them in an opaque box, shake them aboutin that box, and dump them out onto a tabletop. Clearly I would beable to see that there were two objects. But which is a and which is 1 a ? Even though I would be able to see there are two objects, I could2 have no way of knowing whether the one on the left had the property of being-separate-from- a or had the property of being-separate-1 from-a . If the item on the left is a , then it has the property of being-21 separate-from- a ; and if the item on the left is a , then it has the prop-22 erty of being-separate-from- a . But which of these relational proper-1 ties an item has will depend on its being a or a ; i.e. its relational1 210 properties depend on, and do not determine, its numerical identity. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. This little thought experiment - where the objects might exchange places - must not be confused with the problem of re-identifying a at a later time,1 T , with itself at an earlier time, T . (This latter problem will be dealt with in21 chapter 11.) The point here is to challenge the theory that we discriminate between items, e.g. a and a , by recognizing that a has the property of1 2 1288 Beyond Experience Another approach, along lines similar to F ster 's, is to restrict the o class of relational properties to one, very special, class of individ-uation-conferring relational properties. In this latter account, individ-uation is secured for each individual, a , a , ..., a , by that thing 's in- 1 2 n stancing a monadic quality utterly unique to it alone, viz. the property a , being-identical-to- a , ..., being-identical-1211to-a . properties said to be haecceitist properties or individ-n ual essences (see e.g. [2], [126], and [122]). All the objections already leveled against relational properties apply to haecceitist properties inasmuch as haecceitist properties are rela-tional ones. But there is an additional objection to haecceitist proper-ties (or individual essences): they seem to defy the very concept ofwhat a property is supposed to be. If we examine our working inven- tory of ' ordinary ' properties and relations - redness, triangularity , being to the left of , etc. - we nd that each and every one of these is general in the sense that there is a large (potentially innite) class of things which are eligible candidates for having that property or rela- 12tion. But haecceitist properties are strikingly different. There isone and only one thing in the entire universe which could possiblyinstance the ' property ' of being-identical-to- a , namely a itself. 11 Similarly, there is one and only one thing in the entire universe which could possibly instance the ' property ' of being-identical-to- a , namely2 a itself; etc. Haecceitist properties seem to lack the very feature -2 generality - which one might well believe is essential to the concept of property itself. Moreover, proposing haecceitist properties as a solution to the indi- viduation problem seems to present a circularity. W want to know e \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 being-separate-from- a and that a has the property of being-separate-22 from-a . I contend that it is impossible to determine which item has which1 property prior to having discriminated between them. Put another way, I am arguing that to see that a in fact has the property being-separate-from- a ,12 one must already have seen that there are two objects. Relational properties do not account for numerical difference; it is, in fact, the other way around. 11. \" Haecceity \" (pronounced hex -ee-i-ty) is the translation of the Latin \" haecceitas \" (literally \" thisness \"), a ter m coined by the medieval philosopherJohn Duns Scotus (c. 1266-1308). 12. This is true even of ordinal properties. Any number of mountains could have been the twelfth-highest mountain, although at most one actually is. (We will examine ordinal properties in the next subsection, 10.6.2.)Individuation 289 what it is about a which accounts for its numerical difference from1 a . In the haecceitist account we are offered the ' property ' being-2 identical-to- a . But what kind of property is this? On the face of it,1 it looks like an invented ' property ' having just the requisite features needed for the individuation of a .1 But even if one were to allow that haecceitist properties provided a solution to the metaphysical version of the problem of individuation, itis unclear that they solve the epistemological problem. Can oneliterally see such properties? If I am able to tell by looking at twohighly similar physical objects (e.g. newly minted pennies pressedfrom the same dies) that they are numerically distinct, do I do this byrecognizing that the rst (on the left) has the property of being-identi- cal-to-a and the second (on the right) has the property of being- 1 identical-to- a ? Again, as in the case of ' ordinary ' relational proper-2 ties, suppose someone switches a and a without my seeing her do1 2 so. I can still see that there are two objects although I might well now believe (mistakenly) that the one on the left has the property of being- identical-to- a . Even though I now have got their haecceitist proper-1 ties wrong, I have still managed to individuate the objects. How could I have done this, if haecceitist properties account for individuation? If there are haecceitist properties, then there must be as many of them as there are individuable things in the world. Moreover, to beable to individuate things never before encountered (e.g. the individ-ual flakes of cor n in my cereal bowl), I must be able to respond to thestimulus of their haecceitist properties, without of course ever havingencountered such properties before in my life. I nd such a theoryimplausible. From a psychological point of view, that is, of being ableto lear n one 's way about in this world on the basis of past experience,one must assume an ability to generalize from acquaintance with avariety of properties: redness, triangularity, etc. But haecceitist prop-erties (remember these are monadic qualities, not n-place relations) are never instanced in more than one thing. How could one ever, then,prepare oneself to respond correctly to a haecceitist property not yetencountered? How could I possibly have an ability now to individuate flakes of cor n tomorrow, if individuation comes down to recognizingthe haecceitist property (individual essence) of each individual flake?I cannot see how this would be possible. My objections to haecceitist properties are not conclusive. T me, o proposing that a 's having the property of being-identical-to- a is 11 what accounts for the numerical difference of a and a strikes me as1 2 not particularly attractive as a solution. It ' feels ' too much like simply290 Beyond Experience having invented a variant description of the very thing to be explained and then offering that description as explanation. But can we do anybetter? W can nd out only by trying. e 10.6.2 Ordinal properties The theory that ordinal properties individuate has the considerable attraction that it invokes no esoteric or ' peculiar ' properties like rela-tional or haecceitist ones. Ordinal properties are gratifyingly ordinaryand familiar. Examples include ' is the tallest man ' and ' is the fourthlargest freshwater lake ' (Quinton 's examples, [165], 15) and ' is therst dog to be bor n at sea ' (Strawson 's example, [200], 26). Ordinalproperties assign their bearers to a unique position in an ordering(rst, fourth, etc.). Although ordinal properties - like all non-haec-ceitist properties - are general in that there is a potential innity ofthings which are candidates for instancing the property, they differfrom other properties in that no more than one thing in actual fact doesinstance the property. F r example, vast numbers of things are red, o and a still larger number are candidates for being red. But of thesemany things - the red things and the possibly red things - no morethan one can be the reddest thing ; no more than one can be the fth reddest thing ; etc. In this latter regard, ordinal properties would seem to offer especial promise of solving the problem of individuation: per-haps each and every thing instances a unique ordinal property, i.e. hasan ordinal property which is proprietary to it and it alone. Ordinal properties are not simple qualities; they are, in effect, ' col- lapsed ' relations. When they are ' spelled out ' using the resources ofmoder n logic, they can be seen to invoke relations such as is taller than or is bor n prior to . F r example, the sentence \" Rob Roy was theo rst dog to be bor n at sea \" can be reconstructed this way: \" Rob Roywas a dog; Rob Roy was bor n at sea; all dogs, other than Rob Roy,that were bor n at sea were bor n later than Rob Roy. \" Similar para- phrases, or reconstructions, in ter ms of relations can readily be given 13for \" second \", \" third \", etc. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13. Although ordinal properties are ' collapsed ' relations, they are not rela- tional properties. The difference is that relational properties, such as is west of T ronto , refer to specic individuals (e.g. T ronto). Ordinal properties doo o not. In the reconstruction just given of \" Rob Roy was the rst dog bor n atsea \" there is no reference to any individual other than Rob Roy. As we pass from \" rst \" to \" second \", and from \" second \" to \" third \", etc.,Individuation 291 As promising as ordinal properties may initially appear as offering a solution to the problem of individuation, it tur ns out that, in the end,they do not. There are two problems. The rst problem is already familiar. Just as with the theory that numerical difference is to be accounted for by difference in qualities(monadic properties), the theory that numerical difference is to beaccounted for by difference in ordinal properties suffers at the handsof the requirement that it solve the epistemological problem of indi-viduation. F r we regularly individuate things without, for the most o part, being in the slightest aware of their ordinal properties. Y u can o glance at two pencils, fresh out of the box, lying on your desk and tellthat there are two of them without knowing, or indeed having any wayof nding out, which is the older, the slightly longer, the heavier, etc. The second problem, too, recalls a difculty we have already seen. Except for the possible exception of haecceitist properties, there is noconvincing logical principle requiring that any two things must differin one or more qualities. Similarly, there is no logical principle requir-ing that any two things must differ in one or more ordinal properties.Of course no two things can be ' the tallest man ' and no two things canbe ' the rst dog bor n at sea '. But there is nothing to prevent therebeing two or more men, of identical height, being taller than all othermen, or there being two or more dogs all being bor n simultaneously atsea and prior to the birth of all other dogs bor n at sea. In short, there isno logical guarantee that numerically distinct objects must differ, or any factual guarantee that numerically distinct objects do differ, in at 14least one ordinal property, from one another. Even if it is not in fact \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 the complexity of the reconstruction grows exponentially. The reconstruction of \" Riff Raff was the second dog bor n at sea \" is: \" There was some x such that x was a dog and x was bor n at sea and x is other than Riff Raff; Riff Raff was a dog, and Riff Raff was bor n at sea, and Riff Raff was bor n later than x ; and for any y, if y is a dog and y is bor n at sea, and if y is other than x and y is other than Riff Raff, then y is bor n later than Riff Raff. \" 14. Quinton thinks that there is another problem as well, viz. \" we can ... only ascribe ordinal properties to things in theory if they are nite in number \"([165], 16). This is a mistake. Consider an innite class of objects whoselengths are as follows: 1/ 2, 2 / 3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, etc. Each item in this class hasa unique ordinal position, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. While it is true that there is noth-ing which is ' the longest member in the class ' (i.e. is the last item of theordering), it is still nonetheless true that every one of the innite number ofitems in the class has a unique ordinal property. (T be sure, there are some o 1 innite classes which are ' open at both ends ', e.g. {... 1/5, / , 1/ 3, 1/ 2, 2 / 3,4292 Beyond Experience actual, we can at the very least imagine a possible world (again, for example, Max Black 's possible world of two qualitatively identicaliron spheres [p. 286]) where every object has exactly the samequalities as every other and no object has an ordinal property uniqueto it alone. Y t, by hypothesis, in such a world there are two or more e 15objects. Their numerical difference is yet to be explained. 10.6.3 Spatial and temporal relations Although the theory that physical things are individuated by ordinal properties cannot be sustained, our examination of that theory hashelped to reveal just what it is that we seek: some speciable andrecognizable property, or bundle of properties, which each thinginstances and which - by its very nature - cannot be instanced bymore than one thing. Is there any speciable bundle of properties which has this feature? Many negative theorists argue that a physical thing 's position in space and time precisely has this sought-for feature, and, thus, posi-tion in space and time is what nally individuates physical things. It isimportant to understand that it is conjoint position in space and in time which is alleged to be the individuator. P sition in space alone is o insufcient; so too is position in time. F r the property of being at o \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3/4, 4/5 ...} which may be ordered by the relation \" is larger than \", but whose members cannot be assigned ordinal properties. W often describe such e classes just in ter ms of their lacking certain ordinal characteristics, saying of them that \" they lack a rst member and lack a last member \". Thus, it is not the innitude per se of a class which precludes its members instancingordinal properties, but its being open-ended at both ends.) This correction ofQuinton 's error is irrelevant to the two objections made in the text above. 15. There is a third problem as well, perhaps in the end even more serious than the two just mentioned. The essential occurrence of the relation other than in every reduction of an ordinal property to ' standard ' (non-numerical) relations bears comment. (See the example, p. 290, of the reconstruction of\" Rob Roy was the rst dog to be bor n at sea \".) What does \" other than \"mean? The most natural way to interpret this relation is that it is equivalent to\" not identical to \" or \" is numerically distinct from \". In that case, then even toinvoke an ordinal property is to have presupposed a solution to the individ-uation problem. That is, ordinality, it would appear, is logically dependent onindividuation; we will not be able in a noncircular manner to explicatenumerical difference in ter ms of ordinality.Individuation 293 some specic place, e.g. being at P , is a property which any number,1 indeed a potentially innite number, of physical things might instance (by being at that place at different times). Over the last ten years or so,there will have been hundreds of different books, one after the other,on my desk (i.e. at P ). The property of being at P is one which many, 11 many physical things have (at one time or another) instanced. Similarly, the property of being (or existing) at T is one which many116things all instance. At this very moment (i.e. at T ), vast numbers of1 physical objects - some close at hand, others at appreciable distances - instance the property of being at T .1 But combine the two properties - being at a place and being at a time - and the number of bearers collapses. Pick any specic place at any specic time: there is at that place either no things or exactly one;there cannot be two or more things there. Quinton waxes metaphoricalon this point, soaring to heights of inspired prose: There is no limit to the number of things which can be present at a particular map-reference [position in space], provided theyoccur there at different times. Equally there is no limit to thenumber of things that can be in existence at a particular mo-ment of time, provided that they are to be found at differentplaces. But this boundless promiscuity of positions in space andtime considered separately is replaced by the most rigorouspropriety when they are conjoined. A complete, that is to sayspatial and temporal, position is either monogamous or vir- ginal, ontologically [metaphysically] speaking. ([165], 17) P sitional properties - i.e. being at some specic place at some o specic time - have one marked advantage over ordinal properties for purposes of individuation. While there is no guarantee that any givenphysical object instances any ordinal property whatever (recall theexample in the preceding section of the two equally-old dogs bor n atsea), every physical object, it would seem, does occur at a unique position in space and time. While most conjoint positions in space and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 16. Special relativity theory tells us, contrary to our naive intuitions about physics, that the relation is simultaneous with must be treated with extreme care. Two events at different places may tur n out to be simultaneous with oneanother viewed from one vantage point (what physicists call a \" referenceframe \") and not simultaneous when viewed from another.294 Beyond Experience time are empty (there is - colloquially speaking - more empty space in the universe than occupied space), it is still nonetheless true that,' viewed the other way round ', each and every physical object in theuniverse occupies a position in space and time unique to it alone. P sition in space and time would seem to solve not only the meta-o physical version of the individuation problem but the epistemologicalversion as well. W individuate objects by attending to their positionse in space and time. There are two black pens currently on my desk. F r o all intents and purposes they share all their monadic qualities in com-mon. If you were to swap them, i.e. exchange their positions, withouttelling me or showing me, I would not detect that you had done so.And yet I have no difculty at all in seeing that there are two of them.How do I tell them apart? How do I count them? Not by detecting some subtle differences in their qualities. My sight reveals nothingwhatever different in their qualities. Nor do I discer n their numericaldistinctness by taking cognizance of their ' substances '. In this latterregard, I would not know even how to undertake such a task. Rather,I detect their numerical difference at a glance, simply by seeing thatthey are, at one particular time, each in a place different from that ofthe other. Thus, it would appear that we have nally solved both the meta- physical and the epistemological versions of the problem of the in-dividuation of physical objects. P sition in space and time is what o individuates. There apparently is no need to postulate a mysterious' substratum ' as individuator. But philosophers are seldom inclined to ' leave well enough alone '. In philosophy, just as in science, there is no natural stopping point.Having given one explanation or theory, there is then always theinclination and desire to delve deeper yet, to try to understand whatmight account for the truth of the latest theory. In biology, for ex-ample, Gregor Mendel (1822-84) - knowing nothing of the ' mechan-isms ' of heredity - was able to advance a theory which correctlypredicted the statistical transference of features from parent to off-spring. But what lay behind these statistical laws? It was to be manyyears before chromosomes were to be discovered in the nuclei of cells,and further decades still before D N A was to be discovered in the chro- mosomes. At one level of analysis, the puzzle of individuation is solved: it is position in space and time which individuates. But this seeming solu-tion to the problem of individuation is not quite the end of the matter.F r upon probing, this latest answer, in its tur n, is found to harboroIndividuation 295 some further puzzles themselves in need of examination. Just why is it - we might be inclined to wonder - that position in space and time is,as Quinton rakishly puts it, virginal or monogamous? Why is it that notwo physical things are in the same place at the same time? And there is a second problem as well. If, as was argued in chapter 8, we want to posit only a relative space and not an absolute space,then the position of any physical object is not a monadic quality, but atwo- or many-place relation. But if position in space (and equallyposition in time) is a relation, it would seem to be a relation betweennumerically distinct objects. If so, that would, in tur n, suggest that to individuate any one object we would antecedently have had to individ-uate another. The account of individuation in ter ms of spatial and tem-poral position would appear to be in imminent danger of becomingcircular or of presupposing an innite regress. W tur n to these latter two problems in the next two subsections.e 10.6.4 Impenetrability The principle that no two physical things can be at the same place at the same time is often referred to as ' the principle of the impenetrabil-ity of material objects '. This principle merits careful examination. There are two perfectly straightforward ways in which two numeri- cally distinct things can be in the same place at the same time. First, any physical object is at any one time at all the places where any of its parts are. My bedside radio contains, as one of its severalparts, a loudspeaker. That loudspeaker is located at some specicplace, P . In response to the question \" What is located at P ? \" it is per- 11 fectly proper to reply in either of two ways: (1) \" There is a loud- speaker there \"; and (2) \" There is a radio there \". If we designate asmall place, small in the sense that it is contained within a part of a larger thing, then there will be two things at one place: the part of thething, and the thing of which it is a part. Remember (section 8.8), athing does not have to have all of its spatial parts present at a place forit to be at that place. The Mississippi River exists at Natchez althoughother spatial parts are hundreds of kilometers distant. Second, if we choose a place which is large enough, then it can easily contain two or more objects. My ofce at the university is aplace. It contains not just two, but several objects: a typewriter, twoling cabinets, a desk, a telephone, etc. In this latter example, severalobjects all occupy the same place at the same time. Clearly, in their attempt to solve the problem of individuation, when296 Beyond Experience negative theorists invoke the principle of the impenetrability of material objects, they mean to exclude such cases. It is, however, atricky business to state the intuitive principle rigorously so that it doesnot immediately fall victim to counterexamples. It is easy to see why.As a rst attempt, one might try to state the principle more preciselyby formulating it this way: \" A place which contains the part of someobject O cannot simultaneously contain a part of some other object 1 O . \" But this rst try is immediately refuted by the fact that you can2 place your telephone in the drawer of your desk. There would then be in one place two different things: your desk and your telephone. Thislatest difculty arises from the fact that many material objects containvacuities within their boundaries (e.g. an empty drawer in your desk),and it is perfectly feasible to place other objects within these vacuities. P rsons who have promoted the principle doubtless have had ine mind a certain limited number of examples. These examples likelyinclude such commonplace facts as these: P ts do not sink into stove- o tops; the metal surface of the bur ner ' excludes ' the pot. One 's ngersdo not penetrate the keys of a typewriter; although they may depressthose keys, human ngers do not enter into the ' internal space ', i.e.the interior, of the keytops. One might drive a nail into a woodenbeam. But the steel of the nail does not merge into, i.e. for m a com-posite with, the wood bers; instead the nail ' pushes aside ' the woodof the beam and replaces the contents of that region of space, whichhad been of wood, with steel. The problem with trying to capture these latter examples in a defen- sible principle is that not all material things behave in this way.Stovetops and typewriter keys may, but galaxies do not. Although agalaxy may contain thousands of millions of stars, the distancesbetween individual stars are so enormous that it is possible for onegalaxy to pass through another and for both to emerge from the colli-sion, not unscathed, but at least identiable as galaxies ([192], 345-7).But are galaxies material objects? They certainly satisfy most, if notall, of the conditions we pre-analytically ascribe to material objects:their parts are material; they have a certain physical ' cohesiveness ' inthat they move about in space preserving their general size and shape;they are held together by physical forces; etc. And yet galaxies are able to pass through one another. Someone might protest: \" the difference is that galaxies are mostly empty space; bona de (i.e. ' real ') physical objects are far more dense(compact); there are no great ' open spaces ', as it were, in stovetops,our ngers, or steel nails. \" But the trouble with this line of rebuttal isIndividuation 297 that it is false. The surprising truth is that, viewed at the atomic level, our flesh, our stovetops, our steel nails are mostly empty space. Com- pared to the pressures prevailing in the interior of white dwarfs (col-lapsed stars), those affecting physical objects in or near the vicinity ofthe Earth 's surface are relatively slight. The material of white dwarfsis the same basic sort of stuff of which stovetops and ngers are com-posed, viz. electrons, protons, neutrons, etc. But because of the differ- 17ence in pressure, the density of the interiors of white dwarfs is a mil-lionfold that of water. And thus, while the average density of thephysical objects which are common in our own local environment is,in fact, vastly greater than the average density of a galaxy, it remainsvery much less than the average density of certain stellar interiors. Inshort, the fact that stovetops ' exclude ' the pots placed upon them is amore-or-less ' local ' feature of some familiar, ordinary, room-tempera-ture objects. It is not a feature which holds of all material objects, e.g.it does not hold of galaxies. Over the years, writers have expressed a great many differing atti- tudes about the logical (i.e. modal) and the epistemological status of' the ' principle of impenetrability. Newton (1687) had thought that welear n the principle by experience: \" That all bodies are impenetrable,we gather not from reason, but from sensation. The bodies which wehandle we nd impenetrable, and thence conclude impenetrability tobe a universal property of all bodies whatsoever \" ([144], vol. I I, 399). Locke (1690) concurred, and expanded Newton 's claim, arguing thatnot only is the idea that all objects are impenetrable lear ned fromexperience but, further, the very concept of impenetrability itself ' arises ' from experience. The idea of solidity we receive by our touch; and it arises from the resistance which we nd in body to the entrance of anyother body into the place it possesses, till it has left it. There isno idea which we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity. Whether we move or rest, in what posture soever we 18are, we always feel something under us that supports us and hinders our further sinking downwards; and the bodies which \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6 3 17. 10 g / cm ([192], 126) 18. This claim - that we always feel something under us that supports us - is overstated. Most of the time we are not consciously aware of the support of298 Beyond Experience we daily handle make us perceive that, whilst they remain between them, they do, by an insurmountable force, hinder theapproach of the parts of our hands that press them. ... If anyonethink it better to call it [i.e. solidity] impenetrability , he has my consent. ... And though our senses take no notice of it, but inmasses of matter, of a bulk sufcient to cause a sensation in us:yet the mind, having once got this idea from such grosser sen- sible bodies, traces it further and considers it, as well as gure,in the minutest particle of matter that can exist, and nds it in-separably inherent in body, wherever or however modied.([124], book I I, chap. I V, \u00a71) These passages both argue that the principle of impenetrability is lear ned by experience (i.e. a posteriori) and strongly suggest, but donot state explicitly, that their authors regard the principle as a scien-tic truth and not as a necessary (or logical) truth. Certain contemporary philosophers take a quite different point of view. Quinton, for one, takes the principle to be a necessary truth.(Here he is using the expression \" metaphysical truth \" much as I usethe expression \"necessary truth\"*.) If we are confronted by two distinct things between which we can nd no strictly qualitative difference of length or weight orcolour we can always distinguish them by reference to theirrespective positions. What proves this is the familiar but highlyimportant metaphysical truth that no two things can be at thesame place at the same time. ... Individuals [i.e. materialobjects] are, to use an old word, impenetrable , which does not mean that they are never soft or porous. ([165], 17) (In his reference to \" soft or porous \", Quinton is likely being motivated by a similar sort of distinction discussed by Descartes ([55], vol. I I, 225-6).) Quinton offers no argument for his claim that the principle of the impenetrability of material objects is true. He is content to declare it a \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 the floor on which we are standing or of the chair on which we are seated. Locke has here confused what we are capable of feeling, whenever we like, with what we do feel at any time.Individuation 299 ' familiar ' and ' highly important ' necessary truth and to proceed from 19there. But just as sure as Quinton is of the necessary truth of the principle, other philosophers have been just as sure of its contingency.Friedrich W ismann (1897-1959) offers the following possible-worlds a tale: Suppose there were two chairs, A and B, with exactly the same characteristics. The fact that they are in principle distinguish-able depends on the property of impenetrability. Suppose nowthat we lived in a world in which experiences of the followingsort were everyday occurrences. When the two chairs are put sothat they touch, and pressed together, they gradually merge intoone chair; then tur n back into two [qualitatively] identicalchairs. ([209], 201) F r W ismann, the principle of impenetrability is no necessary truth.o a He has no difculty whatever in imagining a possible world in which that principle is false. In his hands the principle is nothing more than aphysical law of this particular world. But can W ismann 's possible-worlds tale really be sustained? It is, a we note, exceedingly brief. If we were to try to ll in details, whatmight we nd? In particular, although W ismann talks, ostensibly, a about ' chairs ', can we really regard ' chairs ' which merge into one an-other as ' real ' physical objects, or is W ismann playing fast and loose a with the concept of physical object ? Can things behave like W is- a mann 's chairs, i.e. act in violation of the principle of impenetrability,and still be regarded as physical objects? I think that W ismann was exactly right. But I also think that a his possible-worlds tale needs some further elaboration to make it aplausible counterexample to the alleged logical necessity of the prin-ciple at stake. The legions of philosophers who have supposed that impenetrabil- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 19. He does, however, slightly qualify his claim, allowing for one exception, viz. the rst of those we discussed a moment ago: \" The only apparent excep-tion to this rule is not an exception in principle. A whole is at every place andtime that its parts are. Wholes and parts share positions. But they share onlysome of their positions. If A has B as a part they are not indistinguishable inposition. F r although all of B 's positions are also A 's, not all of A 's posi- o tions are B 's as well \" ([165], 17).300 Beyond Experience ity does, in some way, gure in our concept of what it is for some- thing to be a material object were on the right track. Where many ofthem were mistaken, however, was in supposing that every material object must at all times be impenetrable. In contrast, I would argue that a ' thing ' can ear n the status of material objecthood by instancingthe property of impenetrability from time to time and from circum-stance to circumstance. Imagine a possible world where select objects are found to be able to merge into one another. Two chairs which share all theirqualities (monadic relations) in common, for example, set upona ' collision ' course are found not to rebound from one another, but to merge into one place and subsequently to separate. Thespectacle admittedly would be highly surprising to a native ofthis universe. Any of us, on the rst occasion of seeing such anevent, would probably be inclined to reckon it a hologram or aconjuring trick. But as we become more familiar with the phys-ics of that world, we recognize that this is no hologram, no con-juring trick. These chairs which are able to merge into oneanother are genuine physical objects. Even though they areinterpenetrable with one another, they are not interpenetrable with other things. They are tangible, publicly observable, and aspermanent as any other xtures in the environment, e.g. tables,trees, and lampposts. W can, if we like, sit on these chairs, e move them about, paint them, weigh them, bur n them, etc. Inshort, they satisfy a great many other properties typical ofmaterial objects. The only caution is that we would have tokeep these chairs from touching one another, for when they do,they temporally ' collapse into one another '. W must not generalize too extensively on this latter possible-e worlds tale and posit a world in which every material object was inter-penetrable with every other, for then we would lose entirely our graspof what it is for something to be a material object. A chair which wasinterpenetrable with everything else could not be sat upon, or painted,or cut into pieces, etc. It would not be a physical object at all. While we can allow interpenetrability for some physical objects under somecircumstances, we cannot allow it for all under any circumstances. In our being able to tell this latter possible-worlds tale, the principle of impenetrability is revealed to be no necessary truth at all, but only acontingency, i.e. it is a proposition which is true in some possibleIndividuation 301 worlds, but not in all. This does not mean that the principle cannot be invoked in an attempt to solve the problem of individuation. What itdoes mean, however, is that the justication for using that principle must rest in experience, not in a priori reason. If typical physicalobjects in this world are individuable because they are impenetrable toone another, then that is a physical law of this particular world, it is nonecessary truth. What is emerging in our researches is the realization that our ability to individuate physical things, indeed numerical difference itself inphysical things, is attributable to certain contingent facts about thisparticular world. W have found a solution to the individuation prob- e lem, but it is by no means one suited for any possible world whatever.Had this world been much different from the way it is, our ordi-nary means of individuating, indeed our very concept of individuation,would have to be different. Just for a moment, let us explore how our techniques of individ- uating physical objects would have to differ in yet another world,where objects are more penetrable than they are in this world. W will e pick up, and continue, our last possible-worlds tale. Suppose we are able to construct a machine which tur ns out objects which look like single chairs. But we discover that theseare actually W ismannesque chairs: whenever these (seem- a ingly single) chairs are left in bright hot sunlight for an hour,they suddenly separate into two qualitatively identical chairs(i.e. into two chairs sharing all qualities in common). Theoriginal chair undergoes something like biological mitosis (celldivision) except that the resulting products each have the samemass as the original. (In the world being described, massis an intensive property [see section 9.2.4], not an extensiveproperty.) The original chair, we are happy to report, cannotseparate when someone is sitting on it because that person 's body would shield the chair from the sunlight. Chairs, as theycome off the assembly line, are called \" coupletons \"; after theyundergo splitting, they are called \" singletons \". Singletons can-not be further ' split '. In merely looking at a chair, no one is able to tell whether it is a coupleton or a singleton. T ascertain whether it is a cou- o pleton or a singleton, one must either know that it is fresh offthe assembly line or subject it to test, by placing it in bright hotsunlight, to observe what becomes of it.302 Beyond Experience In such a world, the problem of individuation cannot be treat- ed more-or-less independently, as it is in this world, from the problem of identity-through-time. How many chairs are in aroom at any one time depends not only on how many seem-ingly distinct chairs there are but essentially on how many ofthose apparently single chairs are in fact coupletons andhow many are in fact singletons. But to answer that questiondepends on determining facts about the chairs ' history or future. In that world, no philosopher has ever suggested thatthe problem of individuation could be handled separately,indeed antecedently to, the problem of identity-through-time. 20Where we see two problems, they see only one. In searching for a solution to the problem of individuation, we dis- cover, once again, how our concepts are tailored to the contingenciesof the world in which we nd ourselves. There is no guarantee that thephysical objects of a world, more particularly the ready-at-hand mostfamiliar objects of our experience, would exhibit the degree of impen-etrability that we nd in this world. W can describe other possible e worlds in which objects are more penetrable, and still other worlds inwhich objects are less (e.g. in which galaxies are tor n apart when theycollide). W simply nd ourselves ensconced in a world where e familiar physical objects are so constituted that the principle of impen-etrability can be used fairly successfully in our creating a workableconcept of individuation. But the principle is no necessary truth, andit probably cannot be stated very precisely. It is a vague principle, adopted and adapted for our everyday needs. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 20. One can, in fact, describe a series of possible worlds where solutions to the problem of individuation become progressively more remote from thesolution in this world. W can, for example, describe possible worlds in e which some objects undergo mitosis but without there being anything in theirhistory or among their manifest properties (see section 9.2.2) to account forwhich will and which will not. In this latter world, whether a chair is acoupleton or a singleton is a matter solely of a disposition. But some chairswill have been bur ned without their ever having been exposed to sunlight.Given the occurrence of such circumstances, where some physical objects arenever subjected to test, individuation could be explicated only counterfac-tually, i.e. it will have to contain a component of this sort: \" x is a coupleton if it were to be subjected to test and were to undergo mitosis. \"Individuation 303 10.6.5 Does individuation presuppose absolute space? F r more troubling than the vagueness and the contingency of thea principle of the impenetrability of material objects is the precise roleplayed by spatial and temporal relations in the negative theorist 'ssolution of the problem of individuation. If one adopts a theory of relational space and relational time, then a physical object 's having a determinate spatial and temporal positioninvolves its standing in spatial and temporal relations to other things in the universe. W locate physical objects in space by specifying their e whereabouts in spatial relation to other things. My scissors are on the desk blotter which, in tur n, is on my desk. The city of Burnaby isimmediately east of V ncouver. And we locate physical objects in a time by specifying their whereabouts in temporal relation to other things. The library at Simon Fraser University was built before theAdministration Building, and it, in tur n, was built before the engineer-ing laboratories. Even when we set up coordinate systems, by whichwe might say that something is located at 116 \u00b032 W and 42 \u00b0N, or that something exists on 18 June 1823, we are tacitly depending on thosecoordinate systems having been xed by reference to specic places(Greenwich and the two poles) and to the conventionally assigned dateof the birth of Jesus. But if xing the position of some physical object in space and time involves a reference to other physical things, then the negative theor- ist 's proposed solution to the problem of individuation would seem toinvolve either an innite regress or circularity. T be able to individ- o uate one thing, it would seem that we would have had to have individ-uated another. One might think that this current difculty constitutes good reason for positing an absolute space and an absolute time. But, on reflection,we can see that an absolute space and an absolute time will not solvethe problem either. The trouble with an absolute space and an absolutetime is that they are each amorphous , i.e. each point of space is indis- tinguishable to us from any other point of space, each point of time is indistinguishable to us from any other point of time. Thus, even if one were to adopt a theory of absolute space and time, one would stillhave to take recourse to relations to determine an object 's position.Newton, who did posit an absolute space and time, saw this difcultyclearly: \" ... because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distin-guished from one another by our senses, therefore in their stead weuse sensible measures of them. F r from the positions and distances of o304 Beyond Experience things from any body considered as immovable [i.e. taken as the xed point of our coordinate system], we dene all places; and then withrespect to such places, we estimate [judge] all motions, consideringbodies as transferred from some of those places into others. And so,instead of absolute places and motions, we use relative ones ... \"([144], vol. I, 8). No theory of absolute space and time can solve the epistemological version of the individuation problem, but a theoryof relative space and time seems to solve the epistemological versionof the individuation problem at the unacceptable cost of an inniteregress or of circularity. Is there any way out of this bind? Quinton thinks there is. He argues that, for each observer, there is one position which is, in a sense, epistemologically ' privileged ' or ' primary ', viz. that person 's ' here-and-now ': \" The position where Iam at the present moment is, then, the absolute point of origin of allmy positional characterisations of things. It is the one position I do nothave to pick out by its relation to something else and by their relationto which in the end everything else is individuated \" ([165], 20). Evenif you were to wake out of a deep coma, not knowing what year itwas, or where on the face of the Earth you were, you would presum-ably still be able to individuate local objects, e.g. the fur niture of yourroom, by reference to your own ' there-and-then '. And yet, I think that in two different ways Quinton 's solution, invoking each individual observer 's own ' here-and-now ', is unsatis-factory. What Quinton has done is to underscore the fact that of all the pos- sible points which one might choose as one 's starting point, or so-called xed point, on which to construct a phenomenological (percep-tual) coordinate system, there is one point which is not arbitrary butwhich virtually forces itself upon us, viz. the point from which we' view the world '. F r visual space, this ' point ' is our eyes. W ' look oe out on ' the world from sockets on the front of our heads. But whilethis is true, it - in its own way - raises problems as serious as those itwas meant to solve. Quinton has ' reduced ' the general epistemological version of the problem of individuation to that of individuating other things withrespect to one 's own body. But this is no ultimate solution. It is tan-tamount to my saying, \" I can solve the individuation problem if youwill allow me to begin with individuating some one thing, and then Ican individuate others with respect to it. \" The question remains: \"Howare you to get the process started?\" It does not matter whether theIndividuation 305 xed point is one 's own body, the T wer of Pisa, or lines of longitude o and latitude. The problem remains basically the same: how can any ofthis be done without an innite regress or circularity? At some point in each of our own personal histories, we had to indi- viduate our own body. None of us is bor n into this world knowing thathe / she has a unique body. The connection between our bodies andour perceptions and kinesthetic sensations is something we had tolear n, by trial and error, during the rst few years of our lives. We had to lear n the difference between consciousness and externality; we had to lear n where our bodies ' leave off ' and other things begin. Having done that, we were then in a position to rely on the correlationbetween certain kinds of sensory data and the external objects whichcause that data as our guide in individuating, at a glance, externalphysical things. But that we are now, as adults, able to do this must not conceal from us the fact that we had to spend a considerable timesorting this all out as youngsters. What we do now habitually, we oncedid only by trial and error. W may now, as adults, use our bodies, and e their unique positions in space and time, as the locus of our individualperceptual coordinate schemes, but this is not innate, it is lear ned. Andwhat still needs explaining is what we must suppose true of the worldso as to warrant our creating such a conceptual scheme. Y u perhaps may detect that I am pushing the epistemologicalo version of the individuation problem back toward the metaphysicalversion. That we are able to discriminate physical objects needs explaining. But it needs explaining, I would suggest, in a way whichdepends not only on facts about us, but equally on facts about physicalobjects which account for their being individuable logically prior to our discriminating between them. And this brings me to the majorcriticism I have of Quinton 's solution of the epistemological ver-sion of the problem of individuation: it abandons the metaphysicalproblem. No ultimately satisfactory solution of the problem of individuation can make individuation depend solely on abilities of human beingsand overlook whatever it is about physical objects themselves whichaccounts for their numerical difference. If we, human beings, are able to discriminate among physical objects, they must have been discrimi- nable before we exercise our abilities. W want an account of individ- e uation which explains the numerical distinctness of physical objectsnot only in worlds in which there are conscious perceivers but inworlds devoid of consciousness altogether. Numerical distinctness of306 Beyond Experience physical objects is not just a feature of worlds in which there are con- scious creatures, but of lifeless worlds as well. In short, Quinton 's account of how we individuate objects leaves unexplained what it is about objects themselves which permits us todiscriminate among them. The dilemma is this. The metaphysical version of the individuation problem would seem to require positing an absolute space, a space' in ' which each and every physical thing would have a unique posi-tion distinct from that of every other thing and independent of theknowledge or perceptual abilities of any conscious creature. But anabsolute space cannot solve the epistemological version of the individ-uation problem. W human beings cannot discer n any difference e between the points of an absolute space. W would seem, then, to have e to take recourse to a relative space. But a relative space just is the set of spatial relations instanced by numerically distinct objects. That is, arelative space is logically dependent on our discriminating physicalobjects: the logical and psychological order is that objects are primary,and that space is derivative, i.e. space is ' constructed out of ' the rela-tions obtaining among physical objects which are antecedently indi-viduated. There are only two ways out of this dilemma. The rst is the way adopted by Newton. He embraced both theories of space (see above, pp. 303-4). He posited an absolute space in which God, but none ofus, would be able to know the absolute position of each thing. And heposited a relative space which we human beings use to individuate andto gauge the motion of physical objects. Such a ' Newtonian ' solution is to be resisted. In positing an absolute space, we invite the inevitable incoherence which we ex-plored at some length in Buber 's befuddlement. Having struggled,both in physics and in philosophy, for more than three hundred yearsto shed the incoherent theory of an absolute space, we should hardlywant to reintroduce that theory in a desperate attempt to solve themetaphysical version of the individuation problem. And in positing atheory of relational space to solve the epistemological problem, weprecipitate a vitiating circularity. In short, were we to adopt both theabsolute and the relative theories of space, the one as a supposed solu-tion to the metaphysical problem and the other as a supposed solutionto the epistemological problem, we would create a composite theoryincorporating the worst features of both of the originals. Moreover, the resulting theory would have more than just internal defects. Anysuch blended solution offends aesthetic sensibilities. It is untidy andIndividuation 307 21profligate. It violates the methodological principle not to multiply entities beyond need. It would grate against our desire for comprehen-siveness in our theories. It would be unacceptably piecemeal. I think there is another way, one which solves both the metaphysi- cal and the epistemological versions of the individuation problem andwhich does not require the positing of an absolute space or saddle uswith the circularity of a relative space. 10.6.6 The solution: A more radical negative theory The problem of the individuation of physical objects will forever remain insolvable so long as negative theorists persist in trying toexplain numerical distinctness in ter ms of space and of properties andrelations instanced at positions in space. This is the post-Leibnizianpicture with which negative theorists have been working for gener-ations. But it is a mistake. T proceed along these lines is to have o failed to appreciate the profound difference between a theory of rela-tive space and a theory of absolute space. The typical negative ap-proach to trying to solve the problem of individuation has been, ineffect, an unwitting illicit amalgam of the two incompatible theories.These attempts have uncritically borrowed from the theory of absolutespace the notion that the points of space, or perhaps I should say theplaces within a space, were distinct from one another independent ofthe objects ' in ' that space. But this hybrid theory cannot be made towork. If one is going to adopt a theory of relative space one must beprepared for a more wholesale conceptual reorientation. In a theory of relative space, space is itself, both in a logical and in a psychological sense, ' constructed out of ' the spatial relations amongnumerically distinct physical objects. Objects are not ' in ' space - thatis the old, absolute theory. In the theory of relative space, what existsare physical objects at varying distances from one another and movingabout with respect to one another; space is then ' constructed ' out ofthese objects. What is logically primitive, and the conceptual founda-tion upon which the rest of the theory is constructed, is the existenceof numerically distinct physical objects. It is little wonder, then, that itbecomes impossible to explain the numerical distinctness of physicalobjects in ter ms of space: the conceptual order is being inverted. Onecan never explicate the primitive concepts of a theory in ter ms of that \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 21. Known as ' Ockham 's razor '308 Beyond Experience theory 's derived concepts: the explication becomes circular. And this is precisely the situation we nd in many theorists ' attempts to solvethe problem of individuation. Through a historical accident, ourhaving earlier posited a theory of absolute space and having not com-pletely thrown off its conceptual shackles, many theorists persist inapproaching certain problems as if they were still working with theearlier theory. They try to explain individuation by invoking prop-erties of space, failing to recognize that a theory of relative spacepresupposes the very existence of numerically distinct physical ob- jects. An incisive discarding of the remnants of the theory of absolutespace is what is needed. W must give up trying to explicate numerical distinctness in ter mse of space. It is not space which is our ' starting point ' and the numericaldistinctness of physical objects which needs to be explicated. It is theconcept of physical object which lies ' at the bottom ', as it were, and it is space (relative space, that is) which is ' constructed ' - both meta-physically and epistemologically - on that foundation. In a worldwhere there are no physical objects, there is no physical space. T fail o to understand that proposition, and thus to fail to understand that theconcept of physical object is more primitive than that of space, is to tur n the conceptual order on its head and to saddle oneself with neces- 22sarily insolvable problems. Edwin Allaire, thirty-ve years ago, argued similarly that no appeal to spatial relations could provide an ultimately satisfactory solution tothe problem of individuation: \" Relations - I 'll stick with spatial ones- presuppose numerical difference; they do not account for it \" ([7], 254). But Allaire was not content to make the numerical difference ofphysical objects an unanalyzable concept, as I have done. Instead, heposited what he and some others (e.g. Gustav Bergmann) called \" bareparticulars \" to account for the numerical distinction: \" Bare particularsare ... the entities in things accounting for the numerical difference of things \" ([7], 253). While bare particulars may, at rst, seem likenothing other than Locke 's substratum given a new name, Allaireexplicitly denied that they were, and argued that, unlike the problem-atic substratum, bare particulars are supposed to be accessible to expe- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22. Although it is notoriously difcult to design experiments to reveal clearly the conceptual framework children devise, there does seem to be anecdotalevidence that children for m the concept of physical object much before, indeed perhaps years earlier than, an abstract concept of physical space .Individuation 309 rience. In a paper written two years earlier ([6]), Allaire had argued that we are ' acquainted ' with bare particulars, meaning by \" ac-quainted \" what Russell had meant when he introduced a technicaldenition for that ter m in 1912: \" W shall say that we have acquain- e tance with anything of which we are directly aware, without the inter mediary of any process of inference or any knowledge of truths \"([178], 46). It is clear Allaire and I agree that we are directly acquainted with the numerical difference of physical objects. W human beings can e 23literally see that there are numerically distinct objects. But I decline to take Allaire 's last step: positing ' bare particulars ' to account forthat numerical difference. I do not believe that there is any ' entity '(Allaire 's own ter m) under or behind or accompanying or ' in ' thephysical object itself which accounts for that physical object 's numeri-cal difference from other physical objects. Still less do I believe thatwe are acquainted with bare particulars or that they are ' presented ' tous like the properties of things, while not, of course, being propertiesthemselves (see [7], 256). Such a theory of perception is empiricallyuntestable and philosophically suspect. A bare particular, like a sub-stratum, is nothing but an invented entity, posited by at as a solution to the problem. But just as in the case of substance, the posit amountsto idle wheel-spinning. Allaire was correct in arguing that spatial rela-tions presuppose numerical difference of objects. But I resist, as creat-ing a mere illusion of further analyzing the concept of numerical dif-ference, his positing of bare particulars. At some point, analysis mustend. I suggest that Allaire has gone one step, an unnecessary step,beyond that stopping point. How, in the end, do we solve the problem of individuation? We solve the problem by recognizing that the concept of physical object is a primitive notion in our conceptual scheme and that the numericaldistinctness of physical objects cannot be explicated in ter ms of any-thing (e.g. relative space) which is derivative in that scheme. Thissolution, which argues that the original question was in some senseimproper, is bound to dissatisfy some readers. (Recall our discussionof the ' Barber paradox ', p. 152 above.) On the face of it, the question \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 23. I am not making the stronger claim, however, that we literally see how many physical objects are within our eld of view. There may be ten objects in my eld of view, and I may be aware of all of them without being awarethat there are ten.310 Beyond Experience \" What accounts for the numerical distinctness of physical objects? \" looks as if it ought to have a straightforward answer. Grammatically itis like the question \" What accounts for the green color of grass? \" But,upon examination of the problem, it can be seen that the concept ofphysical object plays a very special role in our conceptual scheme, one so basic that it does not allow for further analysis, at least not in ter msof the categories space or position in space which require, themselves, to be explicated in ter ms of it. In short, what it all comes down to is a radical, and I think neces- sary, conceptual about-face. It is not space which is the primitive con- cept in ter ms of which physical object is to be explicated; it is the con- cept of physical object which is primitive and in ter ms of which space is to be explicated. In the fteenth edition (1952) of Relativity , Einstein said this in his preface, previewing a newly added appendix:\" ... space-time is not necessarily something to which one can ascribea separate existence, independently of the actual objects of physicalreality. Physical objects are not in space , but these objects are spa- tially extended \" ([64], vi). And in that appendix itself, he writes: \" It appears to me, therefore, that the for mation of the concept of materialobject must precede our concepts of time and space \" ([64], appendix V, 141). What is here true for physics is true as well for metaphysics. And once we have understood the order of priority, there is no specialproblem of individuation. At the very least, it is not a problem ' overand above ' that of explicating physical object itself. W do not have ae concept of physical object of which it is then proper to ask what accounts for the numerical distinctness of physical objects. The con-cept of numerical distinctness lies at the bedrock of our conceptual scheme; there is nothing more basic than it in ter ms of which it mightbe explicated. Numerical difference is not to be accounted for in ter msof a ' presented ' entity (a bare particular), of a ' know not what ' (a sub-stratum), or of any specially favored properties (e.g. spatial relations).T have the concept of physical object is already to have the con- o cept of numerical difference . And the latter concept is not further analyzable. In nding that a particular concept is not further analyzable, we have lear ned something of enormous importance about our conceptualscheme. In lear ning that the problem of individuation cannot besolved by appeal to substance, to bare particulars, to qualities, or torelations, we have lear ned that we had mistakenly got the order oflogical precedence wrong in our thinking about these notions. W had e imagined physical objects strewn about in space and their numericalIndividuation 311 difference accounted for in ter ms of their different positions in that space. Our studies reveal, however, that such a view is ultimatelyuntenable. Our starting point must be that of numerically distinctphysical objects lying at varying distances from one another andmoving about relative to one another. From such a view we can con-struct a workable concept of space. But such a view is grounded uponthe primitiveness of the notion of physical object and numerical dis-tinctness. W cannot - on pain of circularity - try to explain those e notions by invoking properties of space. W may think that we have abandoned the theory of absolute space,e have fully switched over to the theory of relative space, and have seenclearly the implications of the latter theory. But in cold fact, many ofus have not fully done so. Some philosophers believe that the problemof individuation can be solved by invoking spatial relations, but in sodoing they overlook the fact that spatial relations presuppose , and do not ground, the numerical difference of physical objects. Simply put,there are no places logically or epistemically independent of, or priorto, the existence of numerically distinct physical objects. The orderof dependence is from physical things to places; not the other wayaround. 2410.7 Nonphysical objects Identity is a two-place (dyadic) relation. In that regard, it is like is taller than and is envious of . But unlike all other two-place relations, identity is unique in that it can hold only between one thing and itself;it cannot - like is the same height as or is the same age as - ever hold between two numerically distinct things. One might think, then, that itwould be particularly easy to establish in practice when the relation ofidentity holds. But it tur ns out that on occasion it is exceedingly dif-cult to do so. This is so because we often have several logically inde-pendent ways of individuating one and the same thing. W may indi- e viduate some ' thing ' in one way and may individuate some ' thing ' inanother way, and we might not quite be sure whether in doing so we \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 24. I have explored the issues of this section previously in \" Can the Theory of the Contingent Identity between Sensation-States and Brain-States BeMade Empirical? \" in Canadian Journal of Philosophy 3, no. 3 (Mar. 1974), 405-17. I thank the editor of that journal for permission to reprint selectedpassages below. Most of this section is, however, newly written for this book.312 Beyond Experience have individuated two numerically distinct things or have individuated one thing twice. F r example, I sometimes talk about ' my red car ' and I sometimeso 25talk about ' my Oldsmobile '. Each of these descriptions individuates exactly one thing in the universe: I have only one red car, and I haveonly one Oldsmobile. But if you were to overhear me using both ex-pressions you might have no way of knowing whether my red car is(one and the same with) the Oldsmobile, or whether I have (at least)two cars, one red but not an Oldsmobile, and the other an Oldsmobilebut not red. If, however, you were to have access to my cars and wereto examine my red one, you would quickly discover that it is an Olds-mobile; or, if you were to examine my Oldsmobile, you would quicklydiscover that it is red. Y u would be able, as an empirical matter of o relative ease, to establish the identity of my red car with my Oldsmo-bile. With an example such as this in mind, one might get the mistaken idea that identity can always be readily established by direct observa-tion. W need only, one might mistakenly believe, simply examine thee referent of the one individuating description and examine the referentof the other individuating description and the identity (or not, as thecase may be) of the ' things ' referred to would be altogether obvious.But the example of my red car and of my Oldsmobile is not, in theend, a fair representation of the general methodology involved in iden-tifying A with B. F r there are large classes of ' things ' whose identityo poses methodological and metaphysical puzzles which are not solv-able by simple observation or direct empirical examination. T iden- o tify one of these things with ' another ' we will have to grapple withmetaphysical issues which transcend mere observation. In the case of the synchronic identity of physical objects, the focus of the problem is usually on trying to create a viable account of theirnumerical difference in the face of qualitative identity. But in the caseof nonphysical objects, the focus is usually on the other side of thesame coin, on the problem of trying to account for numerical identityin the absence of perceived qualitative identity. W have already seen one example of this latter problem when Ie discussed, in chapter 8 (pp. 181-3), the case of identifying the causesof our visual sensations with those of our tactile sensations. Each of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 25. Or, more exactly, is a uniquely referring expression which may be used to individuateIndividuation 313 these kinds of sensations, the visual and the tactile, exists in a sensory ' space ', i.e. comprises its own self-contained modality* (as it is some-times described), and the problem becomes one of trying to ' identifyacross sensory modalities '. As I argued, there is no necessity that thedata of various sensory modalities correlate highly with one another; itis a brute contingency of this world that they do correlate as highly asthey do. Capitalizing on this correlation, as children we lear ned tosynthesize a unitary sensory space out of these distinct kinds of data,so that now, as adults, we hardly if ever give a moment 's thought tothe profound differences between visual and tactile space. Apart from 26shape, the features of things which we discer n visually - e.g. theirhues, their distances, their transparency or opacity - do not overlapwith the features we discer n tactually - e.g. their texture, their degreeof pliability, their viscosity, their weight. And yet, in spite of thenearly complete difference in the two sets of data furnished by oureyes and by our hands, we posit the identity of the sources of the one with the sources of the other, saying that the thing seen is one and thesame with, i.e. is numerically identical to, the thing felt. This iden-tication is not a matter of observation (like identifying my red carwith my Oldsmobile), but involves making a posit which carries uswell beyond anything ' given ' in perception or demonstrable by empir-ical means. The identity of the visual with the tactile is a posit whichhelps ' to make sense ' of the sensory data, but is not itself anythingperceived, nor, for that matter, is it anything perceivable. If we fail to recognize that identication is possible, even when the descriptions of the ' things ' to be identied are profoundly unalike, wemay fall into the error some philosophers have made in arguing that itis impossible in principle scientically to identify mental states with brain states. F r several generations, a certain element of popular metaphysicso was in advance of that of professional philosophers. F r the past hun- o dred years at least, many persons who would not regard themselves asphilosophers had adopted a particular view about the nature of human \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 26. Although both sight and touch seem to furnish the ' same ' data pertaining to shape, we know that identifying visual shape with tactile shape is some-thing that we had to lear n to do; that ability is no more innate or logicallymandated than is our ability to identify colors and temperatures (in those fewcases where they do correlate, e.g. where an object is heated to incandes-cence). (See p. 181, esp. footnote 20.)314 Beyond Experience consciousness which was at distinct odds with what many skilled phi- losophers were then arguing. This popular view held that conscious-ness was, in some sense, to be identied with the (higher) workings ofa central nervous system. Many philosophers, however, activelyresisted this popular theory, not because they were reactionary bynature, but because they thought that the theory was logically flawed.They pointed out that mental states and brain states ostensibly havedifferent properties . F r example, brain activity consumes a certaino amount of electrical power and gives it off as heat, and is - like anyother physical activity - subject to the physical laws of thermody-namics. But mental states do not seem to have these features at all.Then, too, a mental state, such as your seeing a red apple or hearing aloud noise, does not seem to be paralleled by a corresponding featurein your brain. There are presumably no apple-shaped red patches inyour brain, nor, presumably, are there any loud noises there either. 27Invoking the principle of the indiscernibility of identicals, many phi-losophers were then prone to argue that it was not just false, but -more strongly - that it was impossible , that mental states could be brain states. But the entire debate was reversed at the end of the 1950swith the virtually simultaneous publication by three different philoso- 28phers - U.T. Place ([153]) in ) in 1958, andJ.J.C. Smart ([193]) in 1959 - of what has come to be known as theIdentity theory of mental states and brain states. These philosophersargued that the standard, historically long-lived objections to the iden-tifying of mental states with brain states were not valid. Their rejection of the standard philosophical arguments against identifying mental states with brain states tur ned on two flaws theyclaimed to nd in those arguments. The rst was that even if a de-scription of a mental state did not, in any obvious sense, demand a ref-erence to properties appropriate to physical objects, that in and of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 27. The principle of the indiscernibility of identicals states, recall, that what- ever are numerically identical are qualitatively identical. A logically equiv-alent statement of this same principle reads: \" Whatever are not qualitativelyidentical are not numerically identical. \" It is the latter version which is beinginvoked in the present context. If we wanted a name for this alter native for-mulation, we could call it the principle of \" the nonidentity of discer nibles \". 28. The reprint (1967) of Feigl 's original monograph contains a supplemen- tary bibliography. Between the original and the supplement, the compilationcomprises 565 items published on the mind-body problem.Individuation 315 itself did not mean that mental states were not states of physical things: the description may be incomplete, and incompleteness is noindicator of incompatibility. That we do not typically describe mentalstates using terminology drawn from neurophysiology, physics, andchemistry does not prove that those states cannot be so described. Thesecond flaw these philosophers claimed to nd in the standard argu-ment dealt with the objection that when a person sees, for example, ared apple, there is no apple-shaped red patch in his brain. The wayaround this supposed difculty was to counterargue that it was not the' contents ' or the ' objects ' of consciousness which were to be found inthe central nervous system, but the state or activity of consciousness. What was being identied was not a red patch in one 's visual eldwith a publicly observable red patch in one 's brain - by all accountsthe latter patch does not exist - but it was the activity (or state) of seeing red which was being identied with some activity (or state) in the central nervous system. In the ensuing years, the Identity theory has gone through a variety of renements as philosophers have struggled to improve it and to 29make it more specic. The precise details are best left to otherbooks. Here my sole concer n is with certain arguments which allegethat the Identity theory - in any version whatsoever - can never aspireto the status of being a scientic theory. Brain states are not physical objects, but are states of physical objects. Mental states, too, are not physical objects, but are states ofsomething: of physical objects, if the Identity theory is true, or ofsomething else (of minds or of persons), if the Identity theory is nottrue. Is it possible to identify one property, P , with a property P ? Is it possible to identify one state, S , with a state S ? Two sorts of objec- tions have been leveled against the proposal that the Identity theorymight be testable by laboratory experiment. One of these is a general \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 29. The original proponents of the Identity theory claimed that the identity was contingent . Some subsequent theorists, also sympathetic to the Identity theory, have argued that if the relation is identity, then it cannot be contin-gent, but must instead be necessary . (See, for example, Kripke, [116].) This issue need not be pursued here. In this section, I am not concer ned with themodal status of the Identity theory (i.e. whether it is contingent or necessarilytrue), but with the metaphysical presuppositions we bring to bear in determin-ing the theory 's epistemological status.316 Beyond Experience objection pertaining to the very possibility of establishing empirically the identity of any properties whatever. The other has to do with somealleged special peculiarities of the identication of mental states withbrain states. On the rst score, some philosophers have argued that property- (and state-)identication is possible only when there is an equivalencein meaning between the expression used to refer to the one property(or state) and the expression used to refer to the other. F r example, o one might argue that the properties azure and cerulean are identical because the ter m \" azure \" means the same as the ter m \" cerulean \". Butsince \" a is having a throbbing pain in his hand \" and \" a 's brain is in state x \" do not mean the same thing (however \" x \" may be interpreted), it may be argued that the experience of having a pain can never beidentied with any brain state whatever. But against this theory is the hard evidence provided, within the his- tory of science, of actual examples where property-identication hasbeen successfully carried through. Scientists have, on occasion, iden-tied one property, P , with ' another ', P , without there being any meaning-equivalence between the ter ms used to refer to each. Scien-tists have, for example, identied electric current with the flow ofelectrons in a conductor; diabetes with elevated glucose levels in thebloodstream; radioactivity with the emission of subatomic particles;and visible light with electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 4000 to7000 angstroms. In each case, at the time when the identication wasmade, there was no meaning-equivalence between the ter ms used.\" Electric current \" did not originally mean \" flow of electrons \". \" Dia-betes \" did not originally mean \" elevated glucose level \". Indeed,diabetes was recognized as a distinct illness long before moder nchemistry distinguished glucose from other sugars. It was an empirical discovery that diabetes is elevated glucose levels; it was no linguisticor semantic discovery. W can see, then, that it is sometimes possible to identify propertiese with one another, even if the expressions we use to refer to them donot mean the same thing (or, more specically, even though theexpressions we use to refer to these properties are logically independ-ent of one another). This latter is an important result, for without it, itwould be impossible from the outset to subject the Identity theory toempirical test. But having found that, on occasion, it is possible to identify some properties with one another even though the expressions referring tothose properties are not equivalent, certainly does not by itself guaran-Individuation 317 tee that we will be able to contrive an empirical test of the hypothesis that mental states are brain states. Indeed, at least one philosopher,P ter Herbst, argues that it is impossible in principle, because of thee peculiar nature of mental states and of brain states themselves, ever todemonstrate empirically their identity with one another. Let us then investigate a proposition that there is a particular mental entity which is ... identical with a particular brain state.In order to be able to test it, we must know which mental entityis supposed to be identical with what brain state. Therefore weneed at least two clear and independent identifying referencesto serve as the basis of our proposition of identity. They musteach be sufcient to individuate an entity, or else we cannot saywhat is identical with what, and they must be independent ofeach other, or else the identity proposition expressed in ter msof them becomes tautologous. ([93], 57-8) But having pointed out what he takes to be a logical requirement for putting the theory to empirical test, viz. having independent ways ofindividuating brain states and mental states, Herbst proceeds to ex-press the gravest pessimism about our ever being able to carry out thetask in practice. ... it will not do to individuate experiences of having-a-sensa- tion by their alleged neurophysiological properties. F r exactly o the same properties would also have to individuate the brainstate, and therefore the two identifying references would fail oflogical independence. Thus, for purposes of testing the empiri-cal identity thesis [Identity theory], the ascription of neuro-physiological properties to experiences is not only question-begging but useless. By what shall we individuate them? It is no use trying to individuate them by their spatio-temporal position alone, be-cause, for one thing, we are not in a position to assign spatialpositions to them unless the identity thesis is true, and it cannotbe shown to be true unless sensation-experiences can be spatial position like-wise, and temporal position not useless but in-sufcient. ([93], 58-9)318 Beyond Experience The model Herbst is working with lies just beneath the surface. He is assuming that, in order to be able to demonstrate in a scienticexperiment the identity of A with B, we must have some unique de- scription of A, i.e. a way of individuating (singling out) A and we must have some other way, a logically independent way, of picking out B. F r, as he points out, if the two descriptions are not logically inde-o pendent of one another, if, that is, either one logically entails the other,then the identication of A with B is not a matter of scientic experi- ment at all but is simply a matter of logic (in Herbst 's terminology,the identity proposition is ' tautological ', i.e. true as a matter of themeanings of the ter ms involved). Applying these general requirementsspecically to the Identity theory would imply that for that theory tobe testable by empirical means we would have to have a way of indi-viduating mental states and a way of individuating brain states whichdo not - as a matter of logic - entail that the one is the selfsame thingas the other. Then, having picked out, or isolated, the ' two ' states, wemust be able to demonstrate that the states (or properties) so individ-uated are really one and the same state (or property). But he argues that we will, in principle, be unable to individuate mental states and brain states in a manner suitable for experimentallyidentifying the one with the other. This is so, he argues because (1) ifwe were to individuate mental states by their physical properties, i.e.by the neurophysiological features we use to individuate brain states,then we will have prejudged the very theory we are trying to prove;similarly, (2) if we were to individuate brain states by mentalisticproperties (e.g. by their being painful, or clever, or incoherent), then,again, we will have prejudged the very theory we are trying to prove.But what about individuating brain states and mental states each bytheir spatiotemporal properties? Might we not be able to identify onewith the other if we can show that they are both in the same place atthe same time? Herbst argues (3) that we cannot assign precise spatialand temporal positions to mental states in advance of having acceptedthe Identity theory. Suppose you are now (having the experience of )recalling what you ate for breakfast today. Where, precisely, is thiscurrent memory experience? It is insufcient to offer a vague answerof the sort \" somewhere in my head \", since the identication at whichwe are ultimately aiming is with some very specic state located inparticular nerves and lobes of the brain. In general, if we are depend-ing on spatial positions as the basis for making an identication, it isunsound to identify A which is located ' in the vicinity of P ' with B 1 which is located ' exactly at P '. Herbst thus argues that an answer to1Individuation 319 the question about the location of experiences can be given with the requisite degree of specicity only if one has already accepted the Identity theory. But if one accepts the Identity theory, then one 's test-ing procedure has become viciously circular, presupposing as a prem-ise the very thing to be established as a conclusion. W seem, then, to be faced with what looks to be an intractablee dilemma: unless one assumes that the Identity theory is true, one can-not precisely assign spatiotemporal positions to experiences; but un-less one can assign spatiotemporal positions to experiences, one can-not test the Identity theory. If this argument is accepted, it would appear, then, that the theory that there is an identity between mentalstates and brain states is in principle untestable. Is there any way out of Herbst 's stark dilemma? I think there is, but it requires that we back up and reject the naive methodology whichHerbst has presupposed. His idea of the methodology involved inproperty-identication is the analog of the example we described ofidentifying one physical object with ' another ': recall the case of youridentifying my red car with my Oldsmobile. He seems to believe thatto identify one property with another we must isolate instances ofeach, and then in examining them, we must be able to ' discover ' theiridentity (in much the same way, for example, that we might ' discover 'that two objects have the same length). But when we tur n once againto the pages of the history of science, looking now to lear n how scien-tists actually go about making property-identications, we discoverthat their methodology is nothing remotely like what Herbst hasenvisaged. In the later half of the nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, in their celebrated dynamical (kinetic) theory ofgases, were able to identify the temperature of a gas with the [total 30translational] kinetic energy of the molecules of that gas. The ter m\" temperature \" certainly did not mean (at that time at least) \" total kinetic energy \". The identication plainly was not a matter of discer n-ing any meaning-equivalence between the ter ms used. But neither did the identication take place in the manner presupposed by Herbst 'smodel. These brilliant theoreticians did not proceed by rst experi-mentally individuating the temperature of a gas and experimentallyindividuating the [translational] kinetic energy of its molecules, and \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 30. More exactly, with the mass of the gas multiplied by the root-mean- square speed of its constituent molecules320 Beyond Experience then discovering at a second stage - by some sort of unexplained observation - that these two properties of the gas instance the relationof identity. The identication of the temperature of a gas with the kinetic energy of its molecules came about, rather, on the basis of acertain highly controversial theory about the nature of gases, and on a great number of assumptions about the behavior of gas molecules, e.g.about their relative sizes, their numbers, their interactions, and thenature of their activity on striking the walls of a container. The sub-sequent empirical conr mation of their bold hypothesis of identityrested upon the predictions their theory made of observable macro-scopic phenomena such as rates of diffusion, measures of specicheats, and viscosity. The empirical conr mation of the identity rela-tion has never - not even now, more than one hundred years later -rested on an independent measure of the kinetic energy of the mole-cules. And yet the identication is taken to be so well established as tobe no longer a matter of debate. There are, as well, many other counterexamples to Herbst 's flawed methodology. One of the great mysteries in classical Newtonian physics was the unexplained proportionality between so-called inertial mass andgravitational mass. Physical objects attract one another with a forceproportional to the product of their ' masses '. Physical objects also areaccelerated by forces in proportion to their ' masses '. These are two -seemingly - quite distinct properties, and physicists distinguishedtwo concepts of mass: a physical object 's gravitational mass , and a physical object 's inertial mass . Newton, himself, noted that these two ' masses ' are apparently proportional to one another, but offered noexplanation for it (see [144], book I, defs. I-I I I; book I I I, prop. V I). In 31the nineteenth century, the Hungarian physicist L \u00b4 r \u00b4 nd von E \u00a8 tv \u00a8 s o a o o constructed an apparatus to measure how closely gravitational masscorrelated to inertial mass. His torsion balance (c. 1890) was accurate -8to one part in 100 million (i.e. 10 ). Within the limits possible withhis device, he found no discrepancy whatever between the two meas-urements ([68]). Later measurements (1971) extended the accuracy to -12one part in a million million (i.e. 10 ) ([195], 534). But clearly nosuch measurements, however rened, are capable of showing anything \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 31. Pronounced t -v shu uIndividuation 321 more than a correlation. It is impossible for measurement, even if per- fect, to demonstrate the identity of the properties being measured. Since the late-seventeenth century, experimental physicists had been able to individuate the inertial mass and the gravitational mass ofobjects in logically independent ways and with increasing precision.In so doing they had satised the rst and, on the face of it, the onlyproblematic part of Herbst 's methodology. W re Herbst 's methodol- e ogy sound, it would seem, then, that physicists ought to have beenable, in a relatively effortless manner, to go on to determine whetherthey were observing one property or two. But having individuatedinertial mass and gravitational mass, from as early as 1687 through tothe early-twentieth century, physicists were up against a brick wall.There was no observation possible, or any direct test conceivable,which could answer for them whether they were observing one prop-erty of physical matter or two distinct, but highly correlated, proper-ties. The question deed answer by any appeal to direct observation.The eventual identication of inertial mass with gravitational mass,when it was nally made by Einstein in 1916, did not occur as a resultof his making ner measurements or by observing some telltale fea-ture overlooked by other physicists. Einstein 's posit that inertial mass was not just highly correlated with gravitational mass, but was, in fact, one and the same property,proceeded by his identifying the so-called gravitational eld as beingitself an inertial eld. (See [63] and [64], esp. chaps X I X and X X.) Fields are not observable entities. They are what are often called ' theoretical ' or ' hypothetical ' entities. This is not to say that they areunreal or ctitious, although some philosophers and physicists havebeen wont to so regard them. T say that an entity is ' theoretical ' is to o say that it cannot be observed ' directly '; that its existence is positedand conr med by its explanatory role in a scientic theory. Gravita-tional elds are posited to explain the mutual attraction of physicalbodies (just as electric elds are posited to explain the attraction andrepulsion of charged bodies) (see [64], 144-8). Inertial elds areposited to explain the acceleration of subjected to forces. Byidentifying gravitational elds with inertial elds, it followed as animmediate consequence that the gravitational mass of a body would bethe selfsame as its inertial mass. The identication of gravitational mass with inertial mass did not, then, come about in the sort of naive manner imagined by Herbst. Onedid not individuate inertial mass, individuate gravitational mass, andthen ' experimentally discover ' or ' directly observe ' that the relation322 Beyond Experience of identity held between the two properties. The identication came about because at a higher theoretical level, far removed from the ob-servational base, Einstein posited the identity of gravitational eldswith inertial elds. Why does making such a posit count as doing empirical science? Because predictions which can be derived from the theory in which such a posit occurs are testable. In identifying gravitational elds withinertial elds, Einstein 's theory - unlike Newton 's - entailed thatthe axis of the orbit of the planet Mercury would gradually rotate(precess) ([63], 163-4), that the light emitted from a massive starwould experience a so-called red-shift, and that light rays would bendin a gravitational eld. These dramatic, and unexpected, predictions tobserved astronomical data better than did Newton 's theory. And thusEinstein 's theory won conr mation at the expense of Newton 's the-ory, and Einstein 's posit of the identity of gravitational elds withinertial elds was taken to be indirectly conr med. The empirical route to the conr mation of identity - of temperature with total kinetic energy, of gravitational mass with inertial mass - isno simple or direct matter. It is certainly not a matter to be settledby ' direct observation '. Identity is often established, not by directobservation, but indirectly, through layer upon layer of theory and ofassumption. Such historical examples shed light on the possibility of conr ming the Identity theory because they tell us that if an identication of men-tal states with brain states ever should be made empirically, it will notcome about by individuating instances of states of the one sort, byindividuating instances of the other, and then by discovering that thereis a relation of identity between them. The identication, if it everis made, will be far more roundabout and far more protracted. Andit will involve not only observation and experiment, but also vastamounts of theory. The identication of mental states and brain states is, at present, a working hypothesis. It provides the motivation for a far-reachingresearch program, but its ne details are decades or more away frombeing stated. It will take generations to spell out precisely which brainstates are supposed to be identical with which mental states. Therewill never be any particular laboratory ndings, there will never be acrucial experiment, to which future historians will be able to point andsay, \" That experiment nally tipped the scales and showed once andfor all that mental states are brains states \". The transition, if it occurs,can only come about through a gradual and steady accumulation ofIndividuation 323 vast storehouses of data along with theorizing of ever greater sophis- tication and renement. Sophisticated scientic theories seldom, if ever, appear suddenly, fully articulated. The Identity theory of mental states with brain states,if it is to prove successful, will doubtless follow the historical coursewe have earlier seen of the kinetic theory of heat: a succession ofscientists will adopt it as a working hypothesis, and these generationsof researchers will steadily improve the theory, lling in details,expanding its compass, piece by piece, over a course of time. In thecase of heat theory, the transition to the kinetic theory took twohundred years. Much of the future impetus for the Identity theory will come as much from research in Articial Intelligence as it has, historically,derived from neurophysiology and experimental psychology. Asengineers and theoreticians working together create electronic (andperhaps chemical and atomic) devices to emulate the cognitiveprocesses of human beings, there will be a steadily increasing incen-tive to regard our own actual mental states as being nothing other thanbrain states. Present-day computers are not conscious; they do notthink. But are computers capable in principle of consciousness? Of course it all depends on what one means by ' a computer ' and whatone means by ' consciousness '. If by ' a computer ' one means anelectronic device operating in a linear manner (one step after another),i.e. as a so-called V n Neumann device ([4], 32-3), then there seems o to be accumulating evidence, both experimental and theoretical, thatsuch a computer will never be able to mimic the conscious and cogni-tive processes of an adult human being. But if we mean by ' a com-puter ' nothing more than ' a manufactured device containing no organ-ic materials ', then it is very much an open question whether such adevice could replicate the mental processes of human beings. T date, o there do not seem to be any compelling reasons to believe that it isimpossible in principle. W are beginning to be able to build com- e puters which, in a rudimentary way, imitate some of the cognitiveprocesses of human beings: in patter n recognition; in sensorimotorskills; in ability to play chess; in language translation; etc. If, over the next several decades (centuries perhaps), computers can be built which imitate still better the abilities of human beings - e.g.our ability to understand a spoken language, our ability to communi-cate, our ability to reason, our ability to recognize features of ourenvironment, our ability to lear n, our ability to generalize - there willbe less and less reason to refrain from attributing consciousness to324 Beyond Experience 32them. And once we have begun to attribute consciousness to our computers, we will very likely nd that we regard our own mentalprocesses as being nothing other than the processes of our own built-in computers, i.e. of our brains and their associated peripheral nervoussystems. The Identity theory will have come to be accepted with thekind of natural inevitability at present enjoyed by the theory that thetemperature of a gas is the [total translational] kinetic energy of thatgas and by the theory that inertial mass is gravitational mass. There is a loose end in this scenario, however. T isolate it, we will o back up one last time, virtually to the conceptual roots, at it were, ofthe debate about the Identity theory. \" Why \", it is protable to ask,\"in spite of the fact that so many philosophers and scientists remainundecided about the truth of the Identity theory, have so many othersuncritically accepted it?\" Why do so many nonphilosophers and non-scientists even now believe the Identity theory to be true? Whatevidence promotes that belief ? The evidence cited is well-known. Many persons believe that the Identity theory is true because they are familiar with laboratory nd-ings that certain electrical stimulations evoke vivid memories; thatother electrical stimulations cause or assuage pain; that certain chem-icals introduced in the bloodstream will cause vivid hallucinations,euphoria, panic, sleep, etc. In short, most of us already know that agreat deal of what goes on in our consciousness, perhaps all of it, isprofoundly intimately related to what is happening in our brains. And \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 32. See T ring 's \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \" ([206]) and u Scriven 's \" The Compleat Robot: A Prolegomena to Androidology \" ([187]).T ring 's suggestion that we should want to attribute consciousness to au machine which could ' imitate ' a human being in a question-and-answer game(the ' imitation game ') has been subjected to severe criticism, probablythe most well-known being that by John Searle in his \"Minds, Brains,and Programs\" ([188]). Searle 's critique, in its tur n, provoked a restor mof counterargument (see, e.g., Hofstadter 's reply, along with a reprint ofSearle 's original paper, in [99], 373-82). T a certain degree, Searle 's o criticisms are becoming moot, insofar as they were directed principallyagainst a particular model - the so-called computational model - of ArticialIntelligence instantiated in a V n Neumann machine. But both of these tar- o gets are gradually giving way to newer techniques and bolder architectureswhich one may, reasonably, regard as approaching more and more the struc-ture and functioning of the human brain.Individuation 325 thus many persons have assumed that our mental states just simply are brain states. But of course the latter conclusion is not strictly warranted by the empirical data which are cited in its support. Descartes, too, believedthat most if not all of what goes on in our consciousness is intimatelyrelated to what goes on in our brains, but he, unlike many personstoday, did not believe that mental states were brain states. Indeed, hebelieved that it was impossible that they could be. He was, as we havesaid (pp. 93ff.), a dualist, believing that there was causal interactionbetween the mental states and brain states, but that they could not beidentied one with another. The very possibility of maintaining dualism, as did Descartes, in the face of an exceptionless correlation between mental states and brainstates tells us that something more must be added to the account of themethodology of identity. Given that one can always, in principle, be adualist about any alleged identication - one could, for example, be adualist about temperature and kinetic energy, about inertial and gravi-tational mass, etc. - we must explain why identity is sometimes thepreferable hypothesis. In short, the hypothesis of identity always com-petes against the hypothesis of ' mere correlation '. Any two quantita-tive properties (or states) which are identied must be correlated. Whyshould we ever want to pass beyond positing mere correlation to posita stronger relationship, viz. identity? What empirical evidence couldwe ever have for warranting a hypothesis of identity over and aboveone of mere correlation? Suppose someone were to be a dualist, not with regard to mental states and brain states, but with regard to inertial mass and gravitation-al mass, arguing that all that has ever been experimentally demon-strated (e.g. in E \u00a8 tv \u00a8 s 's experiment and its successors) is a remarkable o o correlation between the two properties and that there has never been,nor could there be, an experimental demonstration that showed any-thing more, i.e. that it is impossible to demonstrate that there is anactual identity between the two. How could such a challenge be met? It is at this point that two powerful metaphysical principles involved in the identication of properties with one another must come intoplay. In the end, the choice of identity over mere correlation is madein part on the basis of the desire for ontological or metaphysicaleconomy. W want not to multiply entities beyond necessity. Mere e correlation posits two ontologically distinct entities; identity posits butone, and is thus preferable. But the latter choice is also mandated by326 Beyond Experience our desire that our theories be explanatorily powerful. In positing ' mere correlation ', an intractable problem remains: \" Why are the twostates correlated? What is the nature of the connection between thetwo? \" Descartes, himself, was crucially aware of this latter difcultyand struggled to offer a cogent answer, but neither he, nor any otherdualist, ever could satisfactorily ll that gaping hole in the theory. In atheory which posits identity, in contrast, there is nothing further to beexplained. If mental states are brain states, then there is nothing to explain in their being correlated. Correlation follows immediately, asa logical matter, from identication. By transcending the empirical data of correlation, in particular by positing an identity, we satisfy at one stroke two intensely powerfulmetaphysical desiderata: we effect an economy in our ontology andwe avoid the need for further explanation carrying, as it might, therequirement of positing still further kinds of entities and hiddeninteractions. In short, when it comes down to positing an identity or a' mere correlation ', if there is not good reason to desist from makingthe identication, identity - not ' mere correlation ' - is the preferredhypothesis. The naive model, which portrays correlation as beingdemonstrable and identity as being a relation which takes ' somethingmore ', over and above ' mere correlation ', to warrant its being posited,has tur ned the metaphysical requirements upside down. Identity is thepreferred hypothesis; ' mere correlation ' a decided second-best, to beinvoked only when there are grounds to believe that identity does notobtain. A scientic version of the Identity theory of brain states and mental states has not yet been well enough conr med to warrant its accept-ance to the degree, for example, that we accept certain identicationsmade in kinetic theory and in general relativity. The Identity theory isat present a remarkably fruitful research program. But it stands to afully articulated theory much as Bacon 's theory, \" Heat is Motion \",stood to the theory of Maxwell and Boltzmann (two centuries later)which explained specically temperature, pressure, viscosity, entropy,free energy, etc., in ter ms of the physical properties of the microstruc-ture of a gas. (Incidentally, Maxwell 's and Boltzmann 's theory washardly the last word. Kinetic theory has continued to evolve, throughthe Dirac and Einstein-Bose repairs, and will continue to evolve forthe foreseeable future.) The Identity theory is in principle empirically testable. T stability e is, however, a matter of degree. The Identity theory, which is todayonly minimally testable, may well grow steadily more testable as itIndividuation 327 becomes, slowly, over many decades, better articulated. T stability e never resides in a single, one-shot, laboratory experiment. It is a muchmore global affair, encompassing observation, creative imagination,theory construction, constant revision, and a metaphysical model ofwhat constitutes ontological economy and explanatory power. Thetesting of the Identity theory will involve hundreds of researcherspainstakingly assembling countless tens of thousands of pieces of datainto a comprehensive whole. It will no more be tested by a singleexperiment, or a few, than was Newtonian mechanics or kinetic theo-ry. And like these latter theories, it will have a penumbra of metaphys-ical assumptions, assumptions which are as vital to the theory as anyof the most directly testable predictions of that theory.C H A P T E R E L E V E N Identity-through-time Different philosophers have used a variety of expressions to refer to the concept of identity-through-time . Some writers refer to it as \" dia- chronic identity \"; some as \" genidentity \"; some as \" re-identication \";and still others, without qualication, as \" identity \". The latter ter m ispotentially confusing because it is sometimes also used to refer to theconcept of individuation . In this chapter, \" identity \" is used only to refer to the concept of identity-through-time , never to individuation . 11.1 Is the problem of identity solely an epistemological one?In his landmark book A Treatise of Human Nature David Hume (1711-76) devoted the single longest ( by far) section to the topic \" Ofscepticism with regard to the senses \" ([101], book I, part I V, section I I). Ostensibly this was a discussion of the grounds for believing in a material external world (of ' objects ' or ' bodies ' in Hume 's terminol-ogy) which is the cause of our sensations (' perceptions ' as Humecalled them). He was, that is, focusing on the inherent difcultieswhich we mentioned earlier (p. 237) in Locke 's theory. Hume adopteda skeptical position. He found that the arguments which would positobjects as the causes of our perceptions were - for him, according tohis standards - inconclusive, and hence, he argued, belief in such 1objects was not rationally well-founded. (I have suggested earlier thatcurrently such conclusions as Hume 's are less attractive simply be- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. Hume did not, however, argue the stronger position, viz. that one ration- ally ought not to believe in the existence of external objects. He claimedthat even if such a belief were not well-founded, we remain nonetheless com-mitted to it: \" W may well ask, What causes induce us to believe in the exist- e ence of body? but 'tis vain to ask, Whether there be body or not? That is a point, which we must take for granted in all our reasonings \" ([101], 187).Identity-through-time 329 cause we have altered our understanding of what may reasonably be regarded as standards of rational belief.) But there is another strain running throughout that section of the Treatise which warrants our attention here. Time and again in that sec- tion, Hume raises the issue of discontinuous perception. He asks aboutthe existence of objects \" even when they are not perceiv 'd \" ([101],188), of mountains, houses, and trees \" when I lose sight of them byshutting my eyes or tur ning my head \" (194), and of the re bur ning inhis hearth \" when I retur n to my chamber after an hour 's absence \"(195). It is easy, in reading these passages, to come away with atotally mistaken notion as to just what the problem of the identity-through-time of material objects is supposed to be. I have known stu-dents who, having read these passages, have come to believe that theproblem of identity-through-time arises solely through the occurrenceof interrupted observation. They have believed - mistakenly - thatidentity is problematic only when we wish to identify something per-ceived at some time or other with something perceived at another timeand when we have not observed the earlier thing as it continuously' evolved ' into the latter. They have believed that there is no problemof identity if one continuously observes a scene. T subscribe to this belief is to fail to comprehend the depth of theo problem. The problem of identity does not come about through inter- rupted perception. T be sure, the case of interrupted perception com- o plicates ascriptions of identity considerably. But the problem of iden-tity exists even in cases of continuous (uninterrupted) perception.More specically, the problem of identity-through-time is not a per-ceptual problem, but a conceptual one. This may be understood byrecognizing that even under circumstances of continuous perception,problems of identity arise. There are two such problems. First, suppose no change whatever occurs in one 's perceptions over some particular time interval. Let 's say, for example, that someoneis keeping careful watch on a valued painting. Over a period of con-tinuous observation, ve minutes we 'll say, no change whatever isperceived to have occurred. Must we conclude that the painting whichexists at the end of this interval is the selfsame (numerically identical)painting as that observed at the beginning? W would, naturally, be e inclined to say that it is. But really, there are a host of metaphysicalassumptions infor ming our answer. In the Middle Ages, some philoso-phers believed that physical objects owed their existence to their being' created '. They also believed that no material object could ' create 'another of the same kind, particularly if that other existed at a later330 Beyond Experience time. F r a material object to exist a minute from now it would have too be created; but no object existing now had within it the capacity to ' create ' a similar kind of material object existing at a different (later)time. Thus it was argued that God, and God alone, could create thefuture object. What may look, on the face of it, to be one materialobject enduring through time was taken - in this medieval account -to be an innite succession of material objects, each lasting for onlyan instant, each created by God in such a manner as to give the 2appearance (illusion really) of one object enduring through time. Insuch an account, it was impossible to observe a material object over aperiod of time: there were no such things. Instead what one actuallyobserved were an innity of successive instantaneous objects. T day o this theory of successive creations is no longer seriously credited, butit serves to remind us that it is not a simple ' fact ' that we see objectsenduring through time. V rious medieval philosophers thought other- a wise. The point is that the very description \" O was perceived through- out the period T to T \" presupposes a certain metaphysical theory 1 2 about the nature of material objects and their existence through time. The merits of that theory are something to be examined, not simplyassumed. The second reason why there is a problem of identity, even under conditions of continuous observation, has to do with precisely theopposite possible results of continuous observation. Suppose now, incontrast, that the ' object ' was seen to change in some way: perhaps itgrew larger, then smaller; perhaps it changed color, or temperature;perhaps it disappeared from sight (maybe even ' went out of exist-ence ') and some time later a qualitatively identical thing appeared. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. Thomas Aquinas (1225-74) writes: \" ... all creatures [i.e. created things] need God to keep them in existence. F r the esse [being] of all creaturely o beings so depends upon God that they could not continue to exist even for amoment, but would fall away into nothingness unless they were sustained inexistence by his power ... \" ([8], I a. 104, I, p. 39). This idea of sustained creation endured into the early moder n period of philosophy. Descartes writes (1641): \" ... it is quite clear to anyone whoattentively considers the nature of time that the same power and action areneeded to preserve anything at each moment of its duration as would berequired to create that thing anew if it were not yet in existence. Hence thedistinction between preservation and creation is only a conceptual one, andthis is one of the things that are evident by the natural light [of reason] \" ([55],\" Third Meditation \" in Meditations on First Philosophy , 33).Identity-through-time 331 What shall we say? Has identity been preserved? Has it been lost? It is clear that the mere fact of observation provides no answer whatsoeverto this question. The problem of identity in this latter case has to dowith what we want to make of what it is that has been continuouslyobserved. The observing was uninterrupted, but the problem of iden-tity is every bit as severe as in the case of interrupted observation. Inshort, we need theories to settle questions of identity, not just observa- tions. The problem is principally a metaphysical one, not an epis-temological or observational one. 11.2 Is identity incompatible with change?There is a great temptation to regard any change whatever, however slight, as destroying a material thing 's identity. F r example, if there o were to be a scratch, however minute [no pun], on my wristwatchtoday which was not on my wristwatch of yesterday, there would bean inclination - on the part of some persons - to argue that today 'swristwatch could not, strictly speaking, be identied as being thewatch which existed yesterday. I have had many students who haveargued precisely this thesis. But it is certainly not a moder n thesis. Itis, we lear n, one which has apparently commended itself naturally tomany persons since antiquity ([189]). In 1739, Hume commentedupon it in his Treatise: ... suppose any mass of matter, of which the parts are contigu- ous and connected, to be plac 'd before us; 'tis plain we mustattribute a perfect identity to this mass, provided all the partscontinue uninterruptedly and invariably the same, whatevermotion or change of place we may observe either in the wholeor in any of the parts. But supposing some very small or incon- siderable part to be added to the mass, or subtracted from it; 'tho this absolutely destroys the identity of the whole, strictlyspeaking; yet as we seldom think so accurately, we scruple notto pronounce a mass of matter the same, where we nd sotrivial an alteration. ([101], book I, part I V, sect. V I, 255-6) Hume has here considered only a change of parts, but he equally well could have been talking of a change in properties. He is making twopoints: one, that however small a change, ' strictly speaking ' thatchange destroys the identity of the object; and two, that when thesechanges are in fact small (inconsiderable or trivial), we do not - in our332 Beyond Experience ordinary conception of identity - regard these changes as destroying identity. He then goes on to illustrate with several examples how ourordinary notion of identity is invoked through all sorts of changes: thereplacement of parts in a ship, the growth of an oak tree, the change inweight of a human being, etc. It would appear, then, that there are two concepts of identity: a ' strict ' one and a ' looser ' common, ordinary, or everyday one. P rhaps there are, or have been, some philosophers who havee adopted this ' strict ' sense of identity. P rhaps it was something like e this that Heraclitus (6th-5th cent. B C) had in mind when he declared that it is impossible to step into the same river twice. But even if thereare a few examples of persons adopting the ' strict ' notion and therebycoming to believe that almost nothing endures through time, this' strict ' notion is emphatically not the notion virtually all of us operatewith nearly all of the time when we think about identity. The ' strict ' notion is a fairly useless notion. Even if, for some mis- guided reason, one were to adopt it as the ' correct ' explication of theconcept of identity, it is clear that one would have, almost immediate- ly, to supplement it with another notion, for all intents and purposesthe ' ordinary ' notion, in order to get on in this world. Virtually every-thing you own, virtually everything you touch, virtually everythingyou see changes in subtle (or gross) ways from minute to minute, hourto hour, and day to day. If any alteration whatsoever were to count asdestroying that thing 's identity, then you could practically neverlay claim to owning anything, to touching anything twice, or to seeinganything twice. Y u could never, for example, have a right to com- o plain of your neighbor 's having broken your lawn mower since yourlawn mower would not have endured through time in any event: had itbeen in your own possession, it would have rusted ever so slightly,and that rusting would have destroyed its identity anyway. And so on. It is easy to state conditions for ' strict ' identity-through-time: an object preserves a ' strict ' identity if it does not change its monadicproperties and has no change in parts. But having stated these condi-tions for ' strict ' identity we are now left with the considerably moredifcult job of stating the conditions for ' ordinary ' identity, the con-cept we need and use daily to get on in this world where objectsundergo constant change, where some of these changes are reckonednot to destroy a thing 's identity, and other changes do destroy athing 's identity. ( From this point on, we will drop the qualications\" strict \" and \" ordinary \". Hereinafter, \" identity \" will be understood torefer to ' ordinary ' identity.)Identity-through-time 333 11.3 Qualitative identity and identity-through-time The problem may be stated formally: under what conditions is O -at-T1 1 to be regarded as numerically identical to O -at-T ? (I stipulate that2 2 \" T \" always signies a time later than \" T \".)21 Immediately we must state a profound difference between identity- at-a-time and identity-through-time. In the for mer case, identity-at-a-time (synchronic identity), it was essential that the objects, O and O , 1 2 being identied shared all properties in common at T . But in the case1 of identity-through-time, where (some) change in properties is given as permitted and indeed something to be accommodated within ourtheory, we cannot demand that O -at-T have all and only the proper- 1 1 ties of O -at-T . Numerical identity-through-time does not require that2 2 the properties of O remain the same as it evolves through time to1 become O . The situation is a bit more complicated. It may be stated2 this way: (P1) (O -at-T = O -at-T ) (O -at-T Q O -at-T &1 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 O -at-T Q O -at-T )1 2 2 2 But we do not have: (P2) (O -at-T = O -at-T ) (O -at-T Q O -at-T )1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 The rst of these principles, (P1), states that if an object O at an ear-1 lier time T is identical with (i.e. is the selfsame object as) O at some12 later time T , then whatever properties O had at T , O - in being the2 1 1 23 selfsame object as O - also had the very same properties at that ear-1 lier time. But the second of these principles, (P2), states, falsely, that if O -at-T is identical to some object O -at-T , i.e. will become over1 1 2 2 time the latter object, then its properties at the earlier time were the very same as they will be at the later time. T repeat, this second prin- o ciple is false; an object need not retain all its properties unchanged inorder to remain the ' same thing '. 11.4 P rts and properties revisiteda One theory which suggests itself to many persons is that what iden- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. Throughout the rest of this chapter, \" properties \" will be understood as \" monadic properties \" and \" qualitative identity \" will be understood as \" shar-ing all monadic properties in common \".334 Beyond Experience ties O at T with O at T is that all, or nearly all, of the parts of O2 2 1 1 2 should be parts that had been those of O , i.e. that what identies1 physical objects is the identity of their parts. Certain sorts of physical objects - e.g. a person 's library, or wardrobe (understood as beingthe clothes a person owns, not the closet in which they are stored),or an heirloom set of dishes - in general the sorts of things which areknown as ' assemblages ' ([165], 65-6), do seem to be identied by 4their parts. But most physical objects are not assemblages and are not identied by their parts. F r most physical objects, the gradual replacement of o their parts with fairly similar parts - just like a gradual and relativelyminor change in their properties - is compatible with their ' remainingthe same thing '. The red car garaged in my carport is the car I boughteight years ago even though in the interim it has had the bulb in the 5left taillight replaced at least a dozen times, has wor n out two sets oftires, has had its brakes and exhaust system replaced, etc. And yet, forall that, it remains the same car, and would remain so even if thereplacements had been more extensive, e.g. if the engine had beenreplaced, all four fenders, both bumpers, the seats, the axle, the igni- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. Some authors prefer the ter m \" clusters \", \" ensembles \", or \" mereological sums \". I, myself, earlier used the ter m \" scattered objects \" (p. 195). See alsofootnote 18, p. 265, and p. 267. If one replaces each of the books of my library with a totally different book - e.g. my copy of Copi 's Symbolic Logic with a copy of Flaubert 's Madame Bovary , etc. - then the resulting assemblage cannot be regarded as being identical with my original library. But some, relatively few,assemblages can withstand replacement of all their parts and still remain the' same ' assemblage. F r example, the United States ' Navy might, one by one, o replace each of the ships in the Seventh Fleet, and the resulting assemblage ofships could, reasonably, or at least arguably, be regarded as being one and thesame as the original Seventh Fleet. And we do sometimes talk this way: \" ThePhiladelphia Orchestra under Muti maintained the lustrous string sheen it hadthree generations earlier under Stokowski. \" Here, the suggestion is that it isthe same orchestra even if, as is probably true, there had been a total changein personnel in the intervening sixty-year period. Although it is useful to bearsuch examples in mind, one must not regard them as denitive or as uncon-troversial, however. 5. Why the left rear bulb, but not the right one, keeps bur ning out, regardless of the manufacture of the replacement bulb, has deed explanation by anyonewhom I have consulted. Alas.Identity-through-time 335 tion system, the fuel system, the cooling system, etc. There is no part, or any number of parts, whose continued presence is essential to thecar 's remaining the same car. (Whether every part can be replaced in a thing, and still have the resulting thing remain the same as the origi-nal, is a question we postpone until subsection 11.6.3 below.) But the objection to making the parts of things their identiers does not rest wholly, or even principally, on the fact that most things arenot identied by their parts. The difculty is more fundamental. The theory that the parts of a thing are its identier - even for the case of assemblages - cannot be the primary account of identity-through-time but must remain derivative, or parasitic, upon a morebasic theory. F r the parts of physical objects (recall the discussion on o p. 261) are themselves physical objects. T identify a thing by the o identity of its parts requires that those parts be themselves identiable.If parts were identiable by their parts, and so on, we would have an innite regress. Eventually, identication by parts must come to anend and we must take recourse to some other, more basic, identier. 11.5 P sitive theories: Substance as identiero Physical objects endure: some for relatively short times, e.g. ice sculp- tures; others for much longer times, e.g. mountains and planets. Butwhether they endure briefly or for long, most physical objects undergochange during their existence. They grow and then decay (or areeaten) if they are alive; they tarnish, have parts replaced, and arepainted, bent, folded, or spindled, etc., if they are inanimate. Some-times the changes things undergo are so drastic as to warrant our say-ing that one thing has ceased to exist and another has come into being,as for example when we sell the family silver serving pieces and allowthem to be converted into a photographic emulsion. The (atoms of )silver may endure through such a radical transfor mation; but theteapot and sugar bowl are gone out of existence, and a new physicalobject, a photographic transparency, subsequently comes into exist-ence. The material (silver) - or to use an old-fashioned word, the\" stuff \" - has endured, but the original physical objects whose materialit was have not. During its ' lifetime ' (the period of its existence), the silver tea- pot underwent a number of changes. It tarnished constantly and wascleaned monthly. In each of those polishings, it lost a thin layer of sil-ver. Over time, the teapot became successively more scratched. At onepoint, its spout sprang a leak and had to be resoldered. And ve years336 Beyond Experience before it was sold, it had been engraved with its owner 's insurance number to aid in recovery if it were stolen. And yet, throughout thisseries of successive and numerous changes, one could reckon it the' same ' teapot. The teapot endured. There is in any such account something that strikes many persons as paradoxical, if not outrightly inconsistent. The very thing which isalleged to have remained the same, i.e. to have endured, is also allegedto have changed. T resolve the conceptual tension, some persons o have constructed positive theories which would attribute to enduringphysical objects two ' aspects ': a deep, or hidden, unchanging perma-nent ' substance ', and an outward, variable set of properties. In suchtheories, the ' substance ' of a physical object is what endures, i.e.persists unchanged through time; what changes are the propertiesgrounded in that substance. Just as substance has been proposed as the individuator (see section 10.3, p. 279, and section 10.5, p. 281), substance has been sometimesproposed as the identier , i.e. as that ' thing ' which confers identity on an enduring object. The many roles often assigned to substance are logically distinct. Even if one were to promote a concept of substance as the solution tothe problem of individuation, one would have to argue further for a(perhaps) different concept of substance, or at least for an expandedrole for substance, to assert that a thing 's substance was what con-ferred its identity-through-time. Substance, understood as being the' individuator ', need not, it is clear, endure through time. Thus positivetheorists might be inclined to supplement their initial account, arguingthat not only is it the nature of substance to ' take up space ' (i.e. to beextended in space), it is also the nature of substance to ' take up time '(i.e. to be extended in time). But whatever objections there were to positing substance as individ- uator are paralleled, and indeed even multiplied, in positing substanceas identier. The most obvious problem recalls an earlier objectionleveled against substance as individuator: positing substance as iden-tier does nothing whatsoever to solve the epistemological problem ofthe re-identication of physical objects. W often have no difculty e whatsoever in re-identifying many familiar objects. I recognize imme-diately the wristwatch sitting on my desk as being the very samewristwatch I placed on the desk an hour ago. And yet I make the re-identication without being in the slightest aware of the enduring sub-stance of the watch. Indeed, I could not possibly be aware of that sub- stance, if by ' substance ' one means ' that constituent of the watchIdentity-through-time 337 which endures unchanged through all incidental changes the watch undergoes '. Certainly no such ' unchanging thing ' is given to me per-ceptually when I examine the watch. But there is another problem as well, having to do not with the epis- temological side of the problem, but with the metaphysical. I mustconfess to not understanding fully what the substance of a physicalthing is supposed to be. But whatever it is, it would seem to be some-thing which is spatially coextensive with the object, i.e. is at all placeswhere the object is. But if so, what happens when a physical part ofthe object is removed from it? Suppose you own a piano and removeone string. Presumably the substance of the piano has been marginallydiminished. But suppose you now replace that string with one qualita-tively identical to the one removed. The piano with the new string isstill the same piano as the one before the swap. (Remember, the goal is to explicate our workaday notion of identity, not a ' strict ', articialnotion.) But is the substance of the piano as it exists after the swap thevery same substance as that of the piano prior to the exchange ofstrings? If it is, then it would seem that the substance of the new stringhas become part of the substance of the piano. This smacks ofmysticism. But if we do not claim that the substance of the piano hasat rst decreased and then increased and indeed latterly been restored,then - according to the theory of substance as individuator - the iden-tity of the piano has been lost: this latest piano cannot be identied,because their substances differ, with the earlier piano. In short, thevery concept of substance itself precipitates the very problem it wasinvoked to solve. F r now we should have to have a theory as to how o much change a substance might undergo to be deemed to have re-mained the ' same ' substance. In foisting the solution of the problem of identity off onto sub- stance, the metaphysical problem has become aggravated, and theepistemological problem has become insolvable. Clearly, a negativetheory is to be vastly preferred. 11.6 Negative theories: Identity without enduring substanceNegative theorists will dispense with such unempirical entities as sub- stance. They will attempt to explicate identity-through-time by meansof certain relations obtaining between entities existing at successive moments of time. Recall (from section 8.7, pp. 186ff.) the argumentthat physical objects ought to be conceived as being extended not onlyin space but in time as well. The task of the negative theorist then338 Beyond Experience becomes one of trying to explain how identity is preserved as things change over time. 11.6.1 Space-time paths The fundamental concept in the negative theorists ' arsenal in their attack on the problem of identity is that of a space-time path . Consider a physical object at rest with respect to its surroundings and undergo-ing no changes in properties or parts. That is, it is simply ' growingolder ', and nothing more. Its path through both space and time, its so-called space-time path, is a ' straight line ': it is, so to speak, movingstraight along the ' time-axis ' (see gure 11.1.A, p. 339). But now sup-pose this object were to rotate about some xed point. A coin placedon the edge of a rotating disk will do as an example. The coin startsout at a certain place, P , at a certain time, T , moves away from that 11 place so that at T it is at P , and eventually retur ns to its original22 place, P , but at a still later time, T . It then moves away again, and13 still later retur ns yet again, and continues to alternate in this manner a great number of times (gure 11.1.B). If, however, we trace the pathof the coin on the edge of the rotating disk, not through time alone,where it follows a straight line, and not through space alone, where itfollows a circular path, but through space and time together, we dis-cover that it follows a corkscrew (or helical) path (gure 11.1.C). Andif someone were to trace your own path, as you move about in spaceover the course of a day, we would discover that your path throughspace-time was neither a straight line, nor a smooth corkscrew, but ajagged zigzag of connected segments of unequal lengths and a varietyof directions. W can abstract from the notion of the actual space-time paths ofe actual objects to a generalized notion of a space-time path itself, inde-pendent of whether or not anything happens to follow that particularpath. Just as there are an innite number of paths through space con- 6necting any two spatial points, there are an innite number of space-time paths connecting any two positions in both space and time. Thereare, for example, in principle an innite number of paths through \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 6. The points need not be distinct. There are an innite number of different spatial paths connecting any point with itself. F r example, if you were to set o out upon a walk, there are in principle an innite number of different spatialpaths you could follow to retur n you to your initial point of departure.Identity-through-time 339 Figure 11.1 space and time which an object might follow to ' get itself ' from the center of London on 11 July 1888 to the dark side of the moon on 18June 2056. There are a (nondenumerable) innity of space-time paths. And just as most points of space are devoid of physical objects (see pp. 293-4), 7most space-time paths are not followed. F r a path to be occupied o means that some physical object, having at least some nite durationin time, follows that path. But of course nding that a space-time pathis occupied (or followed) does not mean that some one physical objecthas endured along that path. A path will be said to be occupiedwhether one object has followed that path, or whether a succession ofdifferent objects has followed that path. F r example, a single object, o a pumpkin, might follow some space-time path. But it is possible fortwo or more numerically distinct objects to occupy successive parts ofone path. A pumpkin, for example, might miraculously be replacedby a horse-drawn coach. Thus, to explicate the concept of identity-through-time, we will need the concept of an occupied space-time \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7. Indeed the actual number of occupied, or followed, space-time paths in the universe is not even a nite fraction of the nondenumerably innite numberof potential paths.340 Beyond Experience path, but we will need considerably more as well. W will need addi- e tional distinctions so as to be able to account for the difference be-tween one thing persisting over time and a succession of things replac-ing one another over time. F r a negative theorist, then, a theorist who eschews substance aso identier, the task becomes one of specifying what sorts of featuresone must look for in an occupied space-time path to warrant oursaying that that path constitutes the history of a single object ratherthan the history of a succession of different objects. In short, we mustlook to see what confers unity on one occupied space-time path anddiversity on some other. One might begin by thinking that to explicate the notion of a physi- cal object evolving through time and preserving its identity, we needrequire only that for each point along some space-time path there mustbe a bundle of properties which is qualitatively identical to the bundleof properties found at every other point along that path. Stating thisrather more formally, we might put it this way: C R I T E R I O N 1: O at (P , T ) is (numerically) identical to O at2 2 2 1 (P , T ) if and only if there exists some space-time path connect-1 1 ing (P , T ) with (P , T ) such that for every point, P and T ,2 2 1 1 ii along this path (including P and T ) there exists an object, O ,2 2 i which is qualitatively identical to O .1 This rst criterion is, obviously, too strong: it precludes change. Our ordinary notion of identity-through-time does not require that the later stage of an object be qualitatively identical to its earlier stages. Wemust nd some way to weaken this initial formulation. Before we try, however, there is an important point to be made about the very nature of this particular manner of proceeding whichthe negative theorist has adopted. Notice how radically the approachof the negative theorist differs from that of the positive theorist. Thepositive theorist looks for something permanent ' in ' the very objectsthemselves to account for identity-through-time. The negative theoristinstead looks not ' within ' objects to account for their enduringthrough time, but looks along a space-time path for certain kinds offeatures, for a succession of ' stages ' as it were, bearing certain sorts ofrelationships to one another. And yet this is not to have replaced theconcept of a single object with the concept of an innite series ofinstantaneous objects. Although we have written of \" O existing at P ii and T \", where \" i \" is understood to range over all the innity of reali numbers between those assigned to the starting and end points [i.e. lying between ( P , T ) and (P , T )], we need not be thought to be1 1 2 2Identity-through-time 341 describing an innitude of numerically distinct objects. Recall that it is an implicit understanding, in our use of variables, that differentvariables may refer to one and the same thing. Although the symbol \" O \" may be distinct from \" O \", it remains an open ques- 0. 24721 0. 3119872 tion whether the two objects referred to by these symbols are numeri- cally identical or distinct. They will be numerically identical - accord-ing to the negative theory - if they stand in certain important relationsto one another; otherwise they will be numerically distinct. One of thenecessary relations is that these objects occur along the same occupiedspace-time path. But considerably more is needed besides. What that' something more ' might be, we tur n to next. 11.6.2 Identity-preserving relations Since qualitative identity is too strong a relationship to insist upon in our attempt to explicate identity-through-time , we might try a weaker relationship, that of qualitative similarity : O and O will be said to be ' qualitatively similar ' if and only if 1 2 either O and O are qualitatively identical,1 2 or O and O differ only very slightly in their1 2 respective (monadic) properties, or virtually all of the parts of O are numerically18identical with parts of O (and conversely).2 With the concept of qualitative similarity in hand, we might try to substitute it for qualitative identity in our rst criterion. Intuitively, the revised account would be to the effect that at each stage ( P , T ) along ai i space-time path connecting the earlier object, O , with the later object,1 O , there is an object, O , which is qualitatively similar to its immedi-2 i ate predecessor (and successor). But this intuitive notion immediately encounters a certain mathematical difculty. Although some physicists have occasionally speculated otherwise (see e.g. [211], section 4.5), to the best of our knowledge, time isinnitely divisible; it is, in the terminology of mathematics, continu- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8. Remember, identication by parts is dependent upon identication by properties. If O is identied with O in virtue of their parts being identied,21 then those parts, in tur n, must at some point be identied by appeal to their differing not at all, or only slightly, in their properties from earlier parts.342 Beyond Experience ous. This means that for any moment (or instant) of time that one may choose, there is no such thing as the ' immediately preceding ' momentor the ' immediately following ' moment, since between any twomoments there are an innity of other moments. Immediate predeces- sor and immediate successor are concepts applicable only to discrete orderings, not to continuous ones. In cases where it is improper tospeak of immediate predecessor and immediate successor, mathe-maticians take recourse to the concept of neighborhood . Roughly (very roughly), we may conceive of the ' neighborhood ' of a point asbeing other points (along the space-time path) which are ' close to that 9point '. Thus, using the concept of neighborhood , we might try the following account of identity-through-time: C R I T E R I O N 2: O at (P , T ) is (numerically) identical with O at2 2 2 1 (P , T ) if and only if there exists some space-time path connect-1 1 ing (P , T ) with (P , T ) such that for every point, ( P , T ), along2 2 1 1 i i this path (including P and T ) there exists an object, O , which2 2 i is qualitatively similar to every object in the neighborhood of (P , T ).i i Unfortunately, this latest repair does not quite work. Where the earlier version - in ter ms of qualitative identity - was too strong, this laterversion is too weak. The trouble is that as we trace the successive objects occupying the path from ( P , T ) to (P , T ), we may nd that although stages close 1 1 2 2 together in time may be only slightly qualitatively dissimilar, these differences may accumulate over long time intervals so as to consti- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9. Smith and Albrecht provide the following rigorous denition of \" neigh- borhood \": \" Let M be any set. W say that d is a distance function or metric e with respect to M if and only if for every two elements p and q of M there is associated a real number d( p, q), called the distance from p to q, satisfying the following properties:1. d( p, q) 0 2. d( p, q) = 0 if and only if p = q 3. d( p, q) = d(q, p) 4. d( p, q) + d(q, r) d( p, r) for all p, q, and r in M. Let (M, d ) be any metric set. Let p be a xed point in M, and let be any positive real number. W dene a neighborhood N ( p, ) of p, with radius as e follows: N( p, ) = {q | q M and d( p, q) < } \" ([194], 58 and 60). F r our purposes above, we choose a value of which is small relative to o the ' distance ' between ( P , T ) and (P , , T ), (P , T )). < 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2Identity-through-time 343 tute wholesale changes between the endpoints. F r example, a paper- o punch may gradually, over time, be converted into a writing pen.Although ' nearby ' stages of the evolving object may be considered tobe stages of the ' same ' thing, the last point cannot be deemed to be 10numerically identical with the rst. Qualitative identity is too stronga relation to require for identity-through-time; qualitative similarity,by itself, is too weak. W shall have to add a further restriction to e qualitative similarity. The counterexample just cited suggests what sort of further re- striction is called for. W should want to require not only qualitative e similarity, but that at each stage along the path, the object O should be i the same type of object as those in its neighborhood. It is not enough just to demand that the objects at the endpoints, O and O , be of the1 2 same type, for that condition would be satised by a paper-punch being transfor med into a writing pen, the pen into a bracelet, thebracelet into a scalpel, and the scalpel into a paper-punch. Althoughthe material (or stuff ) of the original paper-punch would have beenpreserved through all these many changes, it seems incorrect to claimthat the later paper-punch is the very same punch as initiated the series of transfor mations. F r a later punch to be identied with an earlier o punch, it seems entirely reasonable - and consistent with our ordinarynotion of identity - to require that the two be joined by a series ofintermediate stages all of which are themselves paper-punches.Through a series of successive approximations, we arrive at our third,and nal, attempt at formulating a criterion of identity-through-time: C R I T E R I O N 3: O at (P , T ) is (numerically) identical with O at2 2 2 1 (P , T ) if and only if there exists some space-time path connect-1 1 ing (P , T ) with (P , T ) such that for every point, ( P , T ), along2 2 1 1 i i this path (including P and T ) there exists an object, O , which2 2 i is qualitatively similar to each of the objects in the neighbor- hood of ( P , T ) and which is the same type of thing [tree,i i wristwatch, piano, leg, etc.] as O .1 F r convenience, we will hereinafter call this last criterion \" theo strengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity \". It is understoodto require qualitative similarity as well as identity of kind (i.e. of typeor of sort). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. In technical vocabulary, the relation of ' qualitative similarity ' is said to be nontransitive.344 Beyond Experience There is an important consequence implicit in our adopting the strengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity. On such an ex-plication, there simply does not exist a general account of identity- through-time for a ' thing ' which is unqualied as to kind. W can, that e is, give an account of the conditions under which a car, or a hammer,or a book is to be regarded as preserving its identity-through-time, butwe will not be able to give an account - because none is possible - ofthe conditions under which a ' thing ', in general, i.e. of unspecied 11type, is to be regarded as preserving its identity-through-time. Let us now examine this strengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity by applying it to two case studies. 11.6.3 Case study: The ship of Theseus In legend, Theseus killed the Minotaur; in historical fact, he did not of course: the Minotaur is mythical. Whether Theseus himself is cut fromthe fabric of sheer myth or was a genuine historical character is quiteanother matter. Moder n scholarship has not been able to settle thisquestion ([210]), although it has identied the historical elements inthe legend as occurring in the Bronze Age. Thus when Plutarch (c.46-120 A D) wrote a biography of Theseus, it would have been at least a thousand years later, ample time for the story to have been con-siderably altered and embellished. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 11. Marjorie Price dissents from this latter claim, arguing that she can adduce examples where we would want to say that some ' thing ' had persistedthrough time, but where we would be unable to classify that ' thing ' further.Her principal example is this: \" T determine the effects of the Martian atmos- o phere on higher animals, N A S A sends Rover [a terrier] to Mars. After a suc- cessful landing and take-off, Rover retur ns to Earth, where he is continuouslyobserved for six months. Film cameras record every moment of his existence.During this time, Rover undergoes a gradual change, so that by the end of theisolation period he is an amorphous mass of cells. Even the chromosomalconstitution of his cells has changed: its nature is not identiable as the sortto be found in members of any known organism ... No one can deny that theentity in the isolation unit at the end of the interval in question, call it' Clover, ' is Rover. ... Y t we cannot justiably classify Clover as a dog. F r eo the only biologically signicant property Clover shares with any dog thatever lived is the property of being composed of cells \" ([160], 203). Price argues in this possible-worlds tale (1) that identity has been preserved (i.e. Clover is Rover); (2) that Rover was a dog, Clover is not; andIdentity-through-time 345 Theseus 's father was Aegeus, king of Athens. When Theseus was about to set sail from Athens to seek and to try to slay the fearsomeMinotaur, he promised his father that on his ship 's retur n, if he hadbeen successful, the black sails would be replaced with white onesstowed on board. But on retur ning to Athens, Theseus forgot hispromise and, although he had slain the Minotaur, did not change thesails. His father, sighting the ship and seeing the black sails, believedhis son had perished at the hands of the Minotaur and in his griefhurled himself from a cliff to his death. Theseus, thus, ascended thethrone. But at this point in his chronicle, Plutarch pauses for a brief mo- ment. He postpones his recounting of Theseus 's subsequent exploitsjust long enough to tell us something quite curious about the fatefulblack-sailed ship: \"The ship on which Theseus sailed with the youths \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 (3) that in this identication all that is preserved is thinghood, i.e. that there is no sort of thing which Rover was (e.g. a dog or a terrier, etc.) and which Clover is. In short, thinghood itself is preserved, but no specic kind of thing. I am sure that many readers will not share Price 's own strong intuitions and convictions about the case she has constructed. I certainly do not. Whenshe writes, \" No one can deny that the entity in the isolation unit at the end ofthe interval in question ... is Rover \", I will protest. F r my own reaction is o that this entity - whatever it is - is not Rover: Rover has at some point in the six-month interval ceased to exist and has been replaced (sorrowfully) by thisamorphous mass. Moreover, I think that a reluctance to subscribe to Price 'sintuitions can be explained. W re one to allow such an example, then it e would seem that any change whatsoever, just so long as material ' stuff ' endures, would qualify as a preservation of ' identity '. Such a liberalized con-cept of identity errs in much the same way as the earlier, overly restrictiveconcept of ' strict ' identity (section 11.2), viz. it does violence to our pre-analytic concept which allows for some, but not too drastic, change in a thingfor identity to be preserved. But there is more wrong with Price 's arguments than the fact that she has overestimated the degree to which her own intuitions will be shared. There isa more central issue in the debate, and I believe that she is mistaken about itas well. If someone were to argue that the later, amorphous mass, althoughnot a dog or more specically a terrier, is to be identied, as Price says, withRover, then that - by itself - is not sufcient to establish that identity-through-time is possible for ' things ' which are unqualied as to kind. F r o Price to argue this latter point, she must show that there is no sort of thing which has been preserved through this remarkable transfor mation. But onecould argue that there is. Indeed Price, herself, characterizes this later ' thing '346 Beyond Experience and retur ned in safety, the thirty-oared galley, was preserved by the Athenians down to the time of Demetrius Phalereus [c. 310 B C]. They took away the old timbers from time to time, and put new and soundones in their places, so that the vessel became a standing illustrationfor philosophers in the mooted question of growth, some declaringthat it remained the same, others that it was not the same vessel\"([157], Theseus, X X I I I.1). Where Plutarch reports that the philoso- phers ' disputes concer ned ' growth ', we would today understand that itwas identity-through-time which was at issue (see [189]). Anyone who adopts the strengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity is in a position to give a determinate, and reasoned, answer \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 as a \" mass of cells \" (my italics). W might want to add that it is living tissue. e Although this later mass is not a dog, it does have a spatiotemporal identitywith the original tissues of Rover. T be sure, we have no ter m (in English) o for this sort of thing (and this is no surprise since what Price is presenting ismerely a possible-worlds tale and does not describe anything actually exist-ent). But the lack of a descriptive word does not imply that there is no deter-minate sort of thing being described. There is a (hinted-at) sort of thing inPrice 's example: (presumably) exchanges gases with its environment; Clover(presumably) requires energy for its survival; etc. What Clover lacks is a bio-logical classication. If Clover were not a ction but an actual existent and if biologists were to nd their intuitions pulling them in the direction of wanting to say that iden-tity had been preserved in this kind of transfor mation (and that is an impor-tant \" if \"), then they well might want to ll the gap in taxonomy by inventinga new ter m for designating the sort of thing which both Rover and Clover are.Price seems to have confused there not being a name for what sort of thingboth Rover and Clover might be with their not both being of any particularsort whatever. But it is difcult to conceive of there being two physicalobjects which did not share something more in common than the bare factthat they are both physical things. That Clover is not a dog does not provethat Clover is not some sort of thing, , which Rover also was, and that what has been preserved in the transfor mation is a thing of the sort . Price has not shown that Rover and Clover are not both , and indeed, I believe that it is impossible to show it. I have never seen a plausible case where we would want to say that iden- tity had been preserved and were also prepared to assert that no particular sortof thing had been preserved. There is, and can be, no criterion of ' bare ' or' unqualied ' identity-through-time. Identity-through-time is always identityof some determinate sort: of a hammer, of a dog, of a human body, etc.Identity-through-time 347 to the puzzle. The ship, with its replaced timbers, is the ship of The- seus. There is an unbroken spatiotemporal path connecting the later,repaired, thirty-oared galley with the original ship. At each point alongthat path there is a ship (or, more exactly, a ship-stage) which is very like the ships (ship-stages) which are to be found on neighboring (i.e. close-by) points on that same path. W can trace the evolution of the e ship through time as timbers are occasionally replaced. But it remainsthe same ship. (Its changes may be likened to those of the human bodywhere parts [cells] are constantly being replaced, and yet where iden-tity is preserved.) Two millennia after the debate reported by Plutarch, when the prob- lem - which has come to be known simply as ' the ship of Theseus ' -was recounted by Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), we nd that a newcomplicating wrinkle has been introduced. (William Molesworth 'stranslation, dating from 1839, is deplorable. I will paraphrase it.) If the ship of Theseus were continually repaired by the replac- ing of all the old planks with new, then - according to theAthenian philosophers - the later ship would be numericallyidentical with the original. But if some man had kept the oldplanks as they were taken out and were to assemble a ship ofthem, then this ship [containing all the original parts of the ear-lier ship] would, also, without doubt be numerically identicalwith that original. And so there would be two ships, existing at the same time, [in different places,] both of which would benumerically identical with the original. But this latter verdict isabsurd. ([97], part I I, chap. 11, \u00a77) What we nd in Hobbes 's version is the head-on conflict of two reasonable theories of identity-through-time. There are good reasons (as I have just rehearsed) for arguing that the ship with the new partsis numerically identical with the original, earlier, ship: it has anunbroken spatiotemporal continuity with that ship. But there are alsogood reasons for arguing that the ship assembled out of all the dis-carded parts is numerically identical with the original: its timbers areseveral hundred years old; it ' looks like ' an ancient sea-wor n ship;and its parts were present in the original ship. Which one, then, ofthese latter ships is Theseus 's ship? (W will assume that at least one e of them is.) It is important not to believe that the resolution of this puzzle depends on some objective truth, some fact which is there to be dis-348 Beyond Experience covered in the way, for example, one might put to an empirical test the question whether today 's ship is larger than some other or whether itis painted blue. Hobbes 's puzzle is not at all amenable to empiricalresolution. F r our purposes, all the relevant empirical data are in o hand. The question is: \" What are we to make of these data? \" Oughtwe to believe that the ship with the new parts is the original? Or oughtwe to believe that the ship with the old parts is the original? W must e choose between two competing - both prima facie plausible - theo-ries. These theories, since they yield conflicting answers, cannot bothbe regarded as ' right '. But where theories collide and appeal to empir-ical data is precluded, how is it possible rationally to choose? Thedecision must rest on weighing the merits and demerits of each theory. F r my own part, I am convinced that it is the ship with the spank-o ing new parts, the seaworthy one, not the one recently assembled outof the original parts, which warrants being regarded as the one whichis numerically identical to, i.e. is a temporally later stage of, the shipTheseus sailed. A variety of factors infor m my choice. First of all is the fact that the strengthened criterion of spatiotem- poral continuity is more fundamental than the criterion of sameness of parts insofar as the latter criterion presupposes the for mer and notconversely. T identify a thing by its parts requires that the parts, at o some point or other, be identied by their being spatiotemporally con-tinuous with earlier parts. Other things being equal, the criterion ofspatiotemporal continuity takes precedence over the criterion of iden-tication by parts. But are ' other things ' equal in this case? If the discarded parts had not been assembled into a ship, then, doubtless, most persons wouldbe willing to allow that the ship with the replaced parts is identicalwith the original. But the case is not that simple. The discarded partshave been collected and assembled into a ship, and insofar as theyhave been, might that ship not be a viable contender for the title of' ship of Theseus ', and indeed, might that ship not have the strongerclaim? My own reply is to liken the ship assembled from the discarded parts to a cousin laying claim to an inheritance when the deceased hasleft no will. The cousin is the rightful heir if among the surviving rela-tives he is the closest in kinship. But let a son or a daughter be fac-tored into the equation and that child then has a stronger claim thanthe cousin. This is not to say, however, that the claim supported by the criterion of spatiotemporal continuity is absolute or inviolable. Such claims areIdentity-through-time 349 regularly superseded, for example, in the case of assemblages (p. 334). In technical terminology, the priority of the claim sanctioned bythe strengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity is ' defeasible ',i.e. it can be overridden by other, confounding, factors. Might ships,then, be assemblages? Might they be things which we standardly iden-tify by their parts rather than by spatiotemporal continuity? W are certainly not normally inclined to believe so. W standardlyee treat ships much as we do cars, lawn mowers, radios, etc.: we regardthem as preserving their identity even as parts are occasionallychanged. But still there lurks the specter of the ship assembled fromthe discarded parts, with its ancient timbers and leaky hull, faintlycalling out for acknowledgment as being the rightful heir to the title' ship of Theseus '. There can be no verdict in this case which will prove satisfying to every disputant. P rsons ' intuitions are bound to differ. But there is e one further factor which may help to sway some persons toward theclaim made on behalf of the repaired ship with its new timbers.Hobbes introduced the wrinkle of having someone collect, and thenassemble, the discarded parts. I will introduce a further, nal, wrinkle:suppose there were a rst mate who lived on board the ship of The-seus and never left it. (He suffers, we may suppose, a debilitating caseof terraphobia.) Matey (as he 's called) lear ns that someone has collected the dis- carded planks from the ship of Theseus and has assembled them into aship. Matey is totally uninterested. But then Matey lear ns that thisimpertinent scavenger is claiming that the assembled ship is the ship of Theseus. Matey is enraged. \" That 's preposterous \", he bellows.\" That ship is miles inland. The ship of Theseus has never left thewater since the day it was launched. I, myself, have never been off thisship since that day. Since I 've never left the ship of Theseus, and sinceI am here on board this ship, not the one in dry dock, that ship cannot possibly be the ship of Theseus. \" Who is correct? W re the dispute to end in court, and were I to be e on the jury, I would vote for the ship under Matey 's feet and not theone assembled inland of the original timbers. Although Theseus him-self may never have trod the actual planks of the repaired ship, he didtread its decks, he slept in the captain 's stateroom (although never onthe present mattress [straw?]), and he took his meals in the galley,although of course not on the wood of the present table. My verdict:the repaired ship is the ship of Theseus even though its parts may not have been present in that earlier ship. The ship assembled from the350 Beyond Experience discarded parts of the original is a curiosity, but it is not the historical ship of Theseus. Although its parts are ancient, its history as a ship goes back only a few months: it cannot, then, be the ship of Theseus. Someone might protest, invoking the example of London Bridge. The latter, we know, was disassembled and its parts were carefullynumbered, catalogued, and shipped to Arizona. There the parts werereassembled into a bridge standing in the desert at Lake Havasu City.Is this latter structure London Bridge? Certainly. But if so, then how isthis case different from collecting the parts discarded from the ship ofTheseus and assembling a ship out of those parts? If the structure inArizona is London Bridge, why is not the recently assembled ship tobe regarded as being the ship of Theseus? Again, the analogy with the case of the inheritance of property is apt: the cousin will inherit just so long as a son or daughter does notlay claim. Identity of parts will prevail as the identier just so long asnothing lays claim to being the spatiotemporal successor of theoriginal. If the ship of Theseus had been disassembled and its partslabeled and catalogued, moved inland, and there reassembled into aship, then that ship would be the ship of Theseus. But that is not whathappened. The original ship was never disassembled. The originalship stayed afloat. The all-important difference is that between re- placement and disassembly . In cases of replacement, the criterion of spatiotemporal continuity is paramount. In cases of disassembly andsubsequent reassembly, we fall back upon identication by parts. It may seem to you bizarre to explicate the concept of identity- through-time by taking recourse to analogies pertaining to inheritanceand the like. Y u may tend to think of identity as a metaphysical o notion totally removed from the conventions of a legal system and ofhuman practices. Y u may, for example, conceive of the relation of o identity-through-time as being more like the relation of being heavier than than like the relation of being before x in line to succeed to the Crown. One may, that is, believe that the criteria for identity-through- time should be something wholly objective, free from any taint ofconventionality. The core of the concept of identity-through-time is, in fact, fairly free of conventional trappings. The strengthened criterion of spatio-temporal continuity invokes such concepts as space-time path and neighborhood (in its mathematical sense, not demographic). But even in the core concept, a bit of convention may be seen to be creeping in:qualitative similarity is not a precise notion. There is an unavoidable element of conventionality in our determining what are to count asIdentity-through-time 351 being similar, but not exactly alike, in their properties; or what is to count as comprising ' most ' of the parts of a thing. But the strengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity com- prises merely a necessary condition (and a defeasible one at that) for identity-through-time. In actual cases it must be supplemented with avariety of other conditions. Another example will help to illuminatethe nature of these further conditions. 11.6.4 Case study: Mitosis Hobbes 's version of the problem of the ship of Theseus provides an example where two different criteria of identity-through-time - thestrengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity and the criterion ofidentity of parts - yield conflicting results. The prospect of mitosis(ssion), however, provides an example where the fundamental crite-rion of identity itself - viz. the strengthened criterion of spatiotem-poral continuity - might be thought on occasion to yield conflicting,or at least profoundly problematic, results. Every space-time path has an innite number of possible (or poten- tial) branch points. In this (the actual) world, physical objects as theyfollow a space-time path, at arriving at each branch point, pursue onebranch to the exclusion of the other possible ones. (Just as a personarriving at a fork in a road may follow one fork but not both.) Ofcourse this fact that physical objects do not split (like the ' coupleton 'chairs described earlier [see pp. 301ff.]) is just a contingent fact aboutthis world; it is no necessary truth, which means of course that thereare possible worlds where objects do split, i.e. sometimes do followboth branches at a junction point along a space-time path. Amoebae might be thought to constitute a counterexample to the normal behavior of inanimate objects. I remember my biology teacherin high school explaining that amoebae reproduce asexually, by split-ting (i.e. by mitosis). He then went on to add the astounding claim thatevery amoeba alive today \" thus was alive twenty million years ago \".In other words, my high-school biology teacher subscribed to the the-ory that when an amoeba splits, each offspring is identiable with theoriginal, single, amoeba which existed prior to the split. There is a considerable conceptual difculty inherent in this no- 12tion. Suppose the original amoeba and its two offspring were to be \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12. W will ignore the fact that each offspring at rst has only half the masse352 Beyond Experience given names: \" a \", \" b \", and \" c \" respectively. If b were to be identied with a and if c were to be identied with a, then b and c would, although in different places, paradoxically be the selfsame thing. (Weare here invoking the principle which bears the name ' the EuclideanAxiom ', viz. that if y is identical to x and if z is identical to x, then y and z are identical to one another; or, as it is sometimes expressed, ' any two things identical to a third are identical to one another '.) Sucha case is radically different from the case, e.g., of the MississippiRiver 's being in two places at one time, or of a time traveler 's being intwo different places at the same time. In the case of the MississippiRiver, as we have seen, what is involved is two different spatial parts of the river existing in different places at one time. In the case of atime traveler what is involved is two different temporal stages of one and the same person existing at different places at the same time (i.e.the space-time path curves back upon itself ). But the case of theamoebae, b and c, is different. The two exist simultaneously at differ- ent places; they are each ' complete ' amoebae (i.e. they are not spatialparts of a larger organism or of a scattered object); and neither one is a later temporal stage of the other come back in time. How might we handle such a case? Although there is nothing com- pelling us to treat it this way, we standardly regard the case of mitosisas the annihilation of the ' parent ' organism and the ' creation ' (or' birth ') of two offspring. Contrary to the claim of my biology instruc-tor, we do not treat the offspring as identical with the parent. Amoebaealive today were not alive twenty million years ago: their ancestors, ofseveral million generations previously, were alive then; but no amoebaliving today was alive then. What this amounts to is modifying thestrengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity: we will invokethat criterion only for space-time paths where there is no actualbranching. An actual branch-point will be taken to mark the end of theexistence of one thing, and the creation in its place of two successors.But neither successor will have a claim to being identical with thesingle ' ancestor ' prior to the branching. But if this is the standard manner of handling such cases, must we handle them this way? What if not only amoebae, but tables, chairs,human bodies, etc., were to undergo mitosis? And what if the physicallaws of the world were different, so that, for example, objects emerg- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and half the volume of the parent. While true, this is not particularly relevant for the points below.Identity-through-time 353 ing from such a splitting were not half the mass and half the volume of their ' parents ' but were qualitatively identical to their parents? Howmight we handle cases of desks, or chairs, etc. suddenly beingreplaced by pairs of desks, chairs, etc.? Could there be a concept of identity-through-time in such a world? It would be foolhardy to venture an answer with much insistence. W can have only very tentative grounds on which to predict how wee might choose to conceptualize cases which depart so radically fromthe ordinary. What is important in broaching such cases is not somuch anticipating their resolutions, but becoming aware of the exten-sive penumbra of conditions obtaining in our ordinary use of the con-cept of identity-through-time. The criterion we have latterly adduced (p. 343) - viz. that identity- through-time requires (i) qualitative similarity along a space-time pathand (ii) identity of kind - is well suited for the peculiarities of this par-ticular world. But it is not a criterion which would be satisfactory forany possible set of circumstances whatever. It is, rather, tailor-madeby us for this world, a world in which mitosis is nonexistent (or atleast a relative rarity) for ordinary physical objects. The problem posed by the prospect of widespread mitosis is not just metaphysical or epistemological. It dovetails importantly with anextensive network of concepts drawn from as far aeld as ethics, thelaw, and economics. F r the concept of identity interplays in intimate o fashion with questions of ownership and of responsibility and liability.How is ownership to be ascertained? responsibility for damage? If aperson owns a boat which spontaneously splits into two boats, wouldhe have a right to claim ownership of both? W can imagine a possible e world where the very suggestion would be regarded as outrageous;where it would be ' obvious ' that he was morally obliged to chooseone and the other would become public property. And what of the per-son who had damaged the original boat, and failed to repair it before itsplit into two qualitatively identical (damaged) boats? W uld he be o responsible for repairing the pair of later boats? W cannot predict e how we might handle such an eventuality. Much might depend onhow frequently objects split, whether their splitting was foreseeable or 13not, etc. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 13. The possible-worlds case of fusion (merging) is in various ways more problematic even than the case of ssion (splitting). What if qualitativelysimilar objects, when brought within a diameter 's distance of one another,354 Beyond Experience 11.6.5 Ineliminable vagueness in the criterion of identity There are further residual problems with the strengthened criterion of spatiotemporal continuity. Suppose a V lkswagen were to be refashioned, piece by piece, at o the P ugeot plant so as to evolve into a P ugeot; and suppose that thatee P ugeot were then to be refashioned at the V lkswagen plant back intoeo a V lkswagen. There is a space-time path connecting the latter caro with the original such that at every stage along the path there is a car.But is the car at the end of this process, even though a V lkswagen, to o be regarded as being numerically identical to (i.e. one and the sameas) the original V lkswagen? Again I am sure that opinions will differ. o Some persons might see in this latter sequence of events certain analogies with the case of, let us say, a house being painted. The laterhouse is identical with the earlier house, even though the earlier onemight have been a white house and the later one a brown house. Onemight try, in light of such an analogy, to argue that the later vehicle isthe selfsame car as the original, but is not the same V lkswagen , since o at every point along the path connecting the two there was a car, butthere was not a V lkswagen. But this answer, we may be condent, o will not commend itself to everyone. W can imagine someone argu- e ing, \" Being a V lkswagen is not like being white. If a white house is o painted brown, and then repainted white again, the later white house isidentical with the earlier white house. But if a car is transfor med froma V lkswagen into a P ugeot and back into a V lkswagen, it is not tooe o be regarded as the same V lkswagen. \" o Frankly, I do not believe that there is any way a priori to settle this latter debate. I think prephilosophical intuitions are bound to varyfrom person to person. Some will regard the last car in the series asidentical to the rst; others will, just as determinedly, regard it as dif-ferent. If we had a precise, agreed-upon, theory of identity-through-time, we could appeal to that theory to settle the matter. But thetrouble is that it is the very theory itself which is at issue. Our prephil-osophical intuitions are sufciently unclear, and differ enough from \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 suddenly collapsed into one object which could not be made to split into the two originals? How, then, should we want to adjust our concepts of owner-ship, of liability (for damage), etc.? I will leave the pursuit of such questionsas an exercise for your amusement.Identity-through-time 355 one person to another, as to make it problematic just how we might want to rene our theory further. Philosophical theories are not spun out of thin air. They are devised, rst, with an eye to tting some paradigm cases. If they can be con-trived so as to overcome that rst hurdle, then - but only then - mightthey be appealed to in our attempt to settle some borderline disputes.But in the current case, the dispute itself lies not so much at the bor-derline as it does at the center. W discover, very early on, in trying to e for mulate an account of identity-through-time, that persons havestrongly, if not irreconcilably, different intuitions about identity. Itseems unlikely that we could possibly devise a single theory whichaccommodated such a diversity. It should be pointed out explicitly, however, that the problem we see in the case of the V lkswagen-P ugeot-V lkswagen does not arise o e o from the fact that we have attempted to offer a negative theory. This latter problem would have arisen for a positive theory as well. A posi-tive theorist, confronted with the spectacle of a V lkswagen being o transfor med into a P ugeot, and the P ugeot in its tur n being trans- ee for med into a V lkswagen, would be no better off in answering the o question whether the latest car is identical with the earliest one.According to a positive theory, the latest car would be identical withthe earliest one if and only if the substance of the latest were one andthe same with the substance of the earliest. But what is the criterion ofsameness of substance through the sorts of changes we have justdescribed? The problem is displaced, but not solved. The problem is aprephilosophical one, infecting any theory whatever that one might try to construct for identity-through-time, irrespective of whether thattheory is a positive or a negative theory. If our prephilosophical intuitions are - as I believe - so vague and so variable from person to person as to make selecting a precise theoryof identity-through-time arbitrary, then what, if anything, have weaccomplished in adducing and promoting the strengthened criterion ofspatiotemporal continuity? My own opinion is that this latter criterion- vague as it is - is just about the best we can hope to achieve. Thislast account offers us the common conceptual core of our concept ofidentity-through-time . But beyond this point, there is, and can be, no further common (i.e. shared) account. What constitutes identity-through-time for a valued heirloom wristwatch may be strikingly different from that for a wristwatchcarrying no sentimental value. What makes the heirloom watch thewatch it is, in your regard, is the fact that your father personally356 Beyond Experience engraved a message on the back of the watch on the occasion of your twenty-rst birthday. W re the back of the watchcase to be destroyed, e or replaced, indeed even replaced by a qualitatively identical partcomplete with a copy of the original engraving, the resulting watchmight, as far as you were concer ned, simply no longer be worthy ofbeing regarded as the same watch. What is essential, for you, in iden-tifying the watch may be the fact that your father himself engraved theback. Replace that back and what results is a watch, but not the heir-loom you treasure. In contrast, your other watch, the one carryingno sentimental value, can have its parts replaced ad innitum and itwould still remain ' the same watch '. Should we allow such variable, such seemingly extrinsic, factors as sentimental value to play a role in determining a thing 's identity-through-time? \" Isn 't the watch really the same (or different) \", onemight be inclined to argue, \" quite independent of anyone 's attitude toward the watch? Surely identity-through-time is a determinate no-tion, not subject to the vicissitudes of anything as variable and unpre-dictable as persons ' attitudes. Virtually everyone else would regardthe current watch, with its new back, as being identical with the earlierwatch. Surely one person 's idiosyncratic predilections cannot carryany weight in determining whether identity has been preserved. Iden-tity is an objective matter, to be settled by objective general criteria, not by one person 's sentiment or peculiar requirements. \" It is a common human failing to be overly ready to dismiss per- functorily philosophical intuitions and expectations which differmarkedly from one 's own. It would be easy, and I know that manypersons are tempted and some succumb to that temptation, to arguethat such properties as sentimental value have no ' proper ' or ' legiti-mate ' role to play in a philosophical account of identity. Many per-sons bring to philosophy the r mly held belief that philosophicalanalyses should abjure the subjective and should aim for objectivityand determinateness. But that such attitudes may infor m, and indeed explain, the manner of someone 's doing philosophy does not, of course, justify doing phi- losophy in that way. One must beware not to mistake one 's own con-victions as to what a proper philosophical theory ought to look like fora justication for rejecting another 's approach. Identity-through-time is a practical concept, tailored by generations of persons to reflect the contingencies of this world, our particularpractices of law, our institutions of inheritance and ownership, and ourattributions of responsibility and liability. It is naive to believe that itIdentity-through-time 357 can be analyzed in a compact for mula, or that there are but a deter- minate handful of conditions which dictate its use. It is, instead, ascomplex a notion as any of those of ethics or aesthetics. In saying this of the identity-through-time of material objects, I anticipate the thrust of the next, nal, chapter. There I will argue thatthe concept of personal identity is more complex still, and will argue that far from there being any one determinate concept of personal identity, there is only a core concept to which we then append a diverse array of further conditions.C H A P T E R T W E L V E P rsonse I, a stranger and afraid In a world I never made.- A.E. Housman ([100], 109) 12.1 The raccoon 's taleIn the fall of 1982, my department at Simon Fraser University mount- ed its fourth annual public-issues conference. The theme for that yearwas \" Challenges to Science \" and was widely advertised off-campus.The meetings attracted persons from many backgrounds. On the rstday, a buffet lunch was served. Having taken a bit of tuna salad, mywife and I seated ourselves at a table with some strangers. The man onmy left struck up a conversation. \" In my previous life, I was a raccoon \", he said.Thinking this a bit of an odd icebreaker, I replied in what I assumed was the same spirit that the remark had been offered. \" I see. Do you feel a compulsion to wash your food in a mountain stream? \" I quickly discovered my mistake, however. The stranger had been in dead ear nest. He r mly rejected my suggestion, and then persisted,not aggressively, but determinedly, in his claim. \" I was a raccoon before I was a person. \"P rhaps he said \" human being \" rather than \" person \". My memorye is not as precise as I would like on this particular point. I pressed hima bit. \" How do you know that? What makes you believe that you were a raccoon? \" The stranger was unable to offer any evidence beyond his own un- shakable conviction that this was true. In some way, totally unanalyz-able, and apparently not causing him any particular concer n, he just' knew ' he had been a raccoon. At that, the topic had reached a deadP rsons 359 e end and we tur ned to other, more usual, sorts of conversation. In looking back on what was one of the most unusual exchanges of my life, I have had to ask myself several questions. What could it pos-sibly mean for a person to have been a raccoon? Is such an idea evenintelligible? Of course, if we try hard, we can imagine what it wouldbe like to be ' housed ' in a raccoon 's body: instead of having a nose,one would have a snout; instead of hands, claws; etc. But this was notwhat that man had been claiming. He had not claimed that he - a per-son - had been housed in a raccoon 's body; he claimed that he hadbeen a raccoon. Putting aside the question why he might have thought such a thing, one must wonder what sort of theory of personhood wewould have to adopt which would allow us even to imagine such athing. F r a raccoon to ' become ' a person, for some ' thing ', let us sayo x, to ' become ' some later ' thing ', let us say y, it is essential that some- thing or other be preserved in the transfor mation: there has to be some' important ' connection between the earlier x and the later y. But what could this possibly be in the supposed case of a raccoon 's becoming aperson? According to the man who believed this of himself, it was notthe body of the one which became the body of the other. W s it the a mind? By his own admission, he had no memory of having been a rac-coon. But how essential is memory for mind? Could the mind of a rac-coon now be the mind of a man but without the man having a memoryof having been a raccoon? If it was not mind, might it have beensomething else? P rhaps the soul of the raccoon became the soul of e the man. But is this intelligible? What are souls? What counts for oragainst a soul 's enduring and changing through time? In short, theclaim provokes - and for our purposes serves to introduce - thecluster of problems concer ning the analysis of personhood and of theidentity through time of persons. 12.2 P rsons and human beingse Every person I have ever known has been a human being. By \" human being \" I do not mean, as this ter m is sometimes used, \" a decent,upright person \", but rather I mean a living animal of the species Homo sapiens: a flesh-and-blood mammalian creature having a head, a torso, and typically two ar ms, two legs, etc., standing upright, breathing air,eating a variety of organic produce, etc. While every person I have met, and expect to meet, is a human being, it is not at all clear that persons must be human beings or that all human beings are persons. At least for the moment we want to360 Beyond Experience leave it as an open question whether a person could have a nonhuman 12body (an animal body or an electromechanical body perhaps). Then, too, anacephalic infants (human beings bor n with no brain) who maybe able to carry on some basic life processes are not conscious andhave no prospects of consciousness. They are human beings, in thatthey have human (albeit defective) bodies, but it is arguable whethersuch grievously decient, nonconscious human beings can be reason-ably regarded as being persons. One of the most difcult problems some persons have when they rst approach these questions is to sort out the difference between thelegal criteria for personhood and the conceptual criteria. The Law is a poor touchstone for deciding conceptual issues. The Law, in somejurisdictions, may rule, for example, that a fetus is a person. But al-though the Law may so rule, one can always ask, \" Does this law com-port with what our concept of personhood is? Do we have good phi-losophical grounds for accepting that law, or should we want to arguethat it rests on a conceptual mistake and ought to be changed? \" W are e not logically, legally, or morally bound to accept the decisions of Lawin constructing our own best concept of personhood. Ideally, the orderof precedence ought to be the other way round: Law ought to try tocapture the best thinking of the society; it ought to follow the bestthinkers, not lead them. Thus, even if ' the Law ' (and of course ' the Law ' is hardly mono- lithic, but varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, society to society)were to say \" anyone is ( legally) a person who satises the conditionsa, b, and c \", that would certainly not answer for us the question how we ought best to conceive of personhood. Even if in the eyes of theLaw every human being were to be considered a person, that wouldnot tell us whether from a considered philosophical point of view thatwas a warranted conclusion or not. W may be legally obliged to act e in accord with the Law, but we surely do not have to believe or thinkin accord with the Law. Then, too, the Law is nearly always reactive. It responds to needs \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1. W are reminded of Kafka 's Gregor Samsa (a gigantic insect), of Lucas 'se Chewbacca (a W okiee), and of assorted Ewoks, werewolves, frog princes, o etc. 2. Recall such fabulous characters as Pinocchio (more mechanical than electrical) and, of course, See-Threepio (also known as C-3PO) and Robo-Cop.P rsons 361 e and disputes as they arise and become issues in the community. The Law seldom anticipates changing beliefs and thus does not plan inadvance for them. But metaphysics, and philosophy in general, is dif-ferent. Metaphysicians are free to speculate, and indeed considerablyenjoy speculating, on situations which have not arisen - and indeedmay never arise - in their attempts to rene our concepts. F r meta- o physicians, the Law may be a storehouse of case studies, a repositoryof much of traditional thought, but it can hardly serve as the arbiter ofthe cogency of a conceptual reconstruction. The problems, then, to be addressed are these. Virtually every per- son is a human being; virtually every human being is a person. Butmust persons be human beings; must human beings be persons? Could a person have a nonhuman body? Might a human being be other thana person? In short, what is the conceptual connection between being a person on the one hand and being a human being on the other? 12.3 Why individuation and identity collapse in the case of persons Anthony Quinton does philosophy in an admirably painstaking and systematic fashion. It is thus somewhat surprising to nd, in readingThe Nature of Things ([165]), that although he seems to be proceeding in a careful step-by-step fashion, examining rst the problem of indi-viduation of material objects and next the identity-through-time ofmaterial objects, when he comes to the subsequent discussion of per-sons, he skips over the question of the individuation of persons andproceeds immediately to the question of the identity of persons. Whythe apparent omission? On the face of it, there is an entire chaptermissing in his book, and yet - so far as I can tell - he offers not asingle sentence of explanation as to why he departed from what looksto be the obvious and natural game plan. Might there be some reasonwhy one would not treat the question of persons in a parallel mannerto that already established for material objects, that is, by beginningwith the question of the individuation of persons and then, in duecourse, graduating to the question of persons ' identity-through-time? I think there is a reason for not treating the question of persons in this two-step manner. And even if Quinton neglected to address theissue at all, I think we might do well to pause over it for a moment. It is, of course, truistic to say that persons are not ' just ' material bodies. P rsons may have material (in particular, human) bodies, bute they also have properties and moral rights which no mere physical362 Beyond Experience body possesses. P rsons can think and can act in ways that no ' mere ' e physical object, particularly a nonliving object, can remotely replicate.But these remarkable transcendent abilities are not what warrantsleapfrogging over the question of personal individuation directly tothe question of personal identity. The reason is slightly more con-cealed. Material objecthood, i.e. being a material object, can be predicated of an existent thing on the basis of properties it instances, if notexactly all at one moment of time, then over a very short period oftime. T count the objects in a room, for example, a procedure whicho requires that we individuate them, we will have to see which ones oc-cupy space in the sense that they exclude other objects from the samespace. W need this latter test to tell, for example, which are mere e holographic images and which are ' real ' physical (material) objects.But we do not need much of their history to individuate them; theoret- 3ically, a millisecond of endurance is adequate. But there is no suchequivalent determination possible for individuating persons. Of course one could count the human bodies present. But while that is a good practical means, it is not entirely theoretically satisfactory. Some human bodies, even if alive, hardly are the bodies of persons.Human bodies bor n without brains, in which there is no consciousnesswhatsoever, can hardly be regarded as the bodies of persons. And again, it is theoretically possible that a person should have other than ahuman body. In short, at the very least, at the outset of our examiningthe question of the individuation and identity of persons we do notwant to prejudice the issue by assuming that persons must be identi- ed with living human beings. P rhaps at the end of our researches we e may want to assert such a thesis. But if we do, then such a thesis issomething to be argued for, not assumed from the outset. It ought, thatis, if it is to be promoted, to be argued for as a conclusion of an argu-ment and not assumed as a premise. In skipping over the question of the individuation of persons, direct- ly to the question of their identity, we do so because we already havean eye on our eventual conclusions. T be a person is essentially, o \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. That this is so depends very much on certain physical facts characteristic of this particular world. In a W ismannesque world, recall (p. 301), it would a be necessary to know something of the remote history, viz. the details of itsmanufacture, of a seeming single chair to know whether it was in fact onechair or a pair.P rsons 363 e among other things, to be the sort of thing which does (or, in the case of newbor ns, will) have memories. But to have memories requires thatthe person be extended in time. There logically cannot be short-livedpersons (e.g. having a duration of a millisecond) in the way, forexample, there can be short-lived physical objects, e.g. muons whoselifetime is of the order of two-millionths of a second. It is of the es-sence of being a person that one have a history of experiences. 12.4 Is there a self ?In A Treatise of Human Nature , David Hume begins his discussion of personal identity with what, at rst, seems to be nothing more than acasual, innocuous, recounting of a common belief among philosophers 4about our direct acquaintance with our selves. (Although Humerestricts his discussion to the beliefs of fellow philosophers, he mightjust as well have spoken of vast numbers of persons educated andliving in W ster n culture.) \" There are some philosophers, who imag- e ine we are every moment intimately conscious of what we call ourS E L F ; that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfectidentity and simplicity \" ([101], book I, part I V, section V I, 251). But Hume does not broach this topic of self to lend his assent to the com-monly held view; he raises this issue of self in order to probe it and,eventually, to reject the common conception. In one of the mostcelebrated passages in all of philosophy, he shortly continues: F r my part, when I enter most intimately into what I callo mysel f, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain orpleasure. I never catch mysel f at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When myperceptions are remov 'd for any time, as by sound sleep; solong am I insensible of mysel f, and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions remov 'd by death, andcou 'd I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate afterthe dissolution of my body, I shou 'd be entirely annihilated, nor \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. This way of putting the point is not Hume 's, but a moder n reconstruction using terminology, viz. the ter m \" acquaintance \", which has been borrowedfrom Russell. See p. 309 above.364 Beyond Experience do I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If any one upon serious and unprejudic 'd reflexion,thinks he has a different notion of himsel f, I must confess I can no longer reason with him. All I can allow him is, that he maywell be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially dif-ferent in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive somethingsimple and continu 'd, which he calls himsel f ; tho ' I am certain there is no such principle [elemental thing] in me. ([101], 252) If this passage is read supercially, it gives the appearance of being self-refuting, for Hume writes \" I enter ... \", \" I call ... \", \" I conceive ... \", etc. Do not his very own words betray the impossibility of hismaintaining what he claims, viz. that he cannot nd himsel f ? Is not saying, as Hume does, \" I am insensible of mysel f \", as self-refuting as saying, \" I do not exist \"? Once again (recall our earlier discussion, p. 171), we nd a philoso- pher denying that something exists which is thought to be familiar togreat numbers of other persons. And again, just as in other cases, wend in this instance that the philosopher is denying one thing only toassert another. Hume is not, of course, denying that he exists. He is perfectly com- fortable speaking of himself and using the personal pronoun \" I \" ofhimself. What he is denying is that ' self ' is anything ' given ' in per-ception. And what he is offering on the positive side is the thesis thatself is \" a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeedeach other with inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux andmovement \" ([101], 252). In short, Hume 's theory is that self is noth-ing more or less than ' a bundle of perceptions ', or - to use a moremoder n vocabulary, and one not restricted solely to perceptions - self 5is a ' stream of consciousness '. Sometimes this theory is also calledthe ' no-ownership ' theory, since it argues that there is no self whichowns or possesses the succession of items in that stream of conscious-ness: the items follow one another, as Hume says, \" with inconceivable 6rapidity \", but they are not ' in ' or ' of ' a self. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 5. More exactly, he maintains that self is a punctuated, or interrupted, stream, since we all have periods of dreamless sleep. 6. Some persons have argued that Hume 's experiment is naive in that absolutely constant things are, by their very nature, imperceivable and thatwhat Hume was trying to perceive is something which would amount to aP rsons 365 e Some philosophers have agreed with Hume. Richard T ylor, for a one, goes even further than Hume ventured. One imagines that he is deeply, perpetually, unavoidably aware of something he calls \" I \" or \" me. \" The philosopher then bap-tizes this thing his sel f or perhaps his mind, and the theologian calls it his soul. It is, in any case, something that is at the very heart of things, the very center of reality, that about whichthe heavens and r mament revolve. But should you not feelembarrassment to talk in such a way, or even to play with suchthoughts? As soon as you begin to try saying anything what-ever about this inner self, this central reality, you nd that youcan say nothing at all. It seems to elude all description. All youcan do, apparently, is refer to it; you can never say what isreferred to, except by multiplying synonyms \u2014 as if the pilingof names upon names would somehow guarantee the reality ofthe thing named! But as soon as even the least description isattempted, you nd that what is described is indistinguishablefrom absolute nothingness. ([204], 122) T ylor knows full well the common conception of self which he isa bucking. And he is as eloquent in presenting the view he wishes torefute as he has been in denying it. T ylor gives expression to the a commonly held, opposing, view this way: There seem to be two realities - myself and all the rest. By \" all the rest \" is meant the whole of creation except me. ... This rest,this everything else, all that is outside, other, is perpetually \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 constant element in perception. The objection continues by arguing that per- ception operates, essentially, by taking cognizance of differences . An undif- ferentiated, constant element of perception, coextensive* in time with one 'sentire existence, would be an impossibility since it would lack a contrast. Such an objection relies on certain empirical claims about perception, claims which are exceedingly difcult to test. W know that we become e desensitized to long-lasting stimuli: for example, we grow inured to a con-stant aroma, being unable to smell it at all after a long exposure. But still,such data fall short of proving that it is impossible to detect a truly constantelement in perception. The claim is more metaphysical than empirical and,even at that, not particularly self-commending or self-evident. I mention thisdebate, but side with neither party to it.366 Beyond Experience changing, never two moments the same. But at the heart of it all, at that point which is the metaphysical center of my reality,is that self, that which is not something \" else \" - and it does not change, or at least does not become something else. It remains one and the same, throughout all the changes it undergoes, pre-serving its identity through an ever elapsing and growing time.Except for this - that it does nally suffer that calamitouschange, which is its own extinction! And that is a pretty awe-some thought, a dreadful thought, a cosmic insult. ([204], 122) T ylor argues (not at all well or convincingly, in my opinion) againsta this latter view of sel f. And he concludes: W wanted something [i.e. a self ] to present as an ultimatee reality, to contrast with everything else, and we found total,perfect nothingness! It isn 't there. Imagination creates it. Intel-lect distinguishes it. Metaphysics builds intellectual fortressesupon it. Religion guarantees its salvation - always, of course,on certain ter ms - and promises to push back the nothingnessthat approaches it. And all the while, it is itself the most perfectspecimen of nothingness! One does indeed feel like a child dis-covered making a face at himself in the mirror. One wantssomehow to cover up what was going on, embarrassed at hisown ridiculousness. ([204], 123) T ylor 's counsel, then, for those afflicted with the Dread of Death:a The self cannot die, for there is no self. Hume 's and T ylor 's extreme ideas about self are heady, perhaps a 7alar ming, and for some persons, even frightening. But they are also important, if for no other reason than to cause us to shake off our com-placent, comfortable misconception that there is any universal idea of selfhood. F r theirs is but one of a bewildering array of quite different o notions of what sel f might be. Visit any well-stocked library and look at the number of books cata- logued under the subject heading \" self \". (And look, too, at the numberdealing with \" death \".) The gures are staggering, and writers from an \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 7. They are also threatening if read by someone reared in a religious tradition where sel f (or soul) is a central concept and where children have been taught not to question church dogma.P rsons 367 e enormous number of elds all contribute to the froth: philosophers, to be sure; but also psychologists (of every imaginable stripe, in fact, a veritable industry given over togenerating an endless supply of articles, novels, and lear ned books onthe topic of sel f. Our collective curiosity on this topic ( like that on sex and diet) seems limitless. W will conne our attention to the major philosophical theories ofe personal identity. 12.5 The principal contemporary theories of personhoodF r a person a-at-T to be identied with a person b-at-T , there must o 12 be some thing, or set of features, which unies the two, which accounts for their being two stages of one and the same person. Theprincipal theories are these: - The unifying principle is soul (self, or mind). - The unifying principle is physical body (usually, if not invari- ably, a human body). - The unifying principle is similarity between successive bundles of sensations. - The unifying principle is personality and memory.- The unifying principle is an amalgam of various of the preced- ing. Although I have never taken a poll, my own educated guess, arising from my having been brought up and exposed to much the same sortof culture as everyone around me, is that the theory that it is soul (orself ) which accounts for a person 's identity is the most widely heldone of the lot. It has, however, steadily, and perhaps at a quickeningpace in moder n times, been losing some of its original religious trap-pings. Many persons who are not religious still cling to a concept ofsoul not terribly unlike that historically promoted by Christianity.Many non-Christians retain the belief that the soul is, in some fashion,not a physical thing, but a supernatural sort of entity. Where their \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 8. I will ignore all the execrable \" self-help \" books written by an ar my of poseurs and dilettantes whose scientic credentials are often vanishinglyclose to nil.368 Beyond Experience notion departs from traditional religious views is in their abandoning the further belief that souls endure beyond bodily death. They havecome to adopt a ' secular ' concept of soul. Soul is posited to be whatmakes one person different from another, while at the same time soulsare believed, somehow, to be dependent for their existence upon theexistence of a living human body. All in all, soul appears as amysterious ' I know not what ' which plays the theoretical role ofproviding the basis for personal identity. Soul, while not physical, iswhat is conceived of as being what is essential in a person. The posit-ing of soul as a solution to the problem of personal identity is a posi-tive theory analogous to the positing of substance as a solution to theproblems of individuating and re-identifying physical objects. Andlike the theories of material substance, it encounters similar sorts ofmetaphysical and epistemological difculties. Some persons, we all know well, have an unshakable conviction that souls exist. They are as sure of the existence of souls as they areof tables and chairs. Other persons are less sure; and some persons, ofcourse, are convinced that souls do not exist. Souls (if they exist) arenot publicly perceivable things. W cannot prove or demonstrate the e existence of souls by holding them up for public display, or by point-ing to one, or even by directing persons to introspect and thereby todiscover their own souls. Hume, as we saw a moment ago, tried theexercise and reported abject failure. So did T ylor. This is not to say a that everyone who tries the exercise must fail. Hume knew that somepersons might try the experiment and come to believe that they hadsucceeded in nding their souls. But Hume 's, T ylor 's, and many a other persons ' reported failures do tell us that searching for one 's soulby introspection is not a test which yields anything like universalagreement. And it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that persons whodo report success in administering the test to themselves are personswho were antecedently disposed strongly to believe that they hadsouls. From a methodological point of view, successful reports of theexperiment must be regarded as tentative at best and, perhaps, suspectas well. But my purpose here is not so much to argue against the existence of souls as it is to point out that their existence is problematic. Andthat their existence is problematic is all that is needed to render soulsinappropriate platfor ms on which to erect solutions to the problem ofpersonal identity. There are, to be sure, some exceedingly troubling cases in which we might be terribly unclear whether personal identity has been preservedP rsons 369 e or not. (W shall tur n to some of these cases presently.) But in both e ordinary and troublesome cases, we never actually proceed by tryingto detect the person 's soul and asking ourselves whether it is, or is not, identical with some earlier (or later) soul. The fact is that, whatevermight be our nal opinion about the existence of souls, we never ac-tually invoke the concept of soul in our day-to-day re-identication ofother persons or even, for that matter, of ourselves. Y u may catch a o glimpse of someone on the street who looks like a long-lost friend.\" Could that be Jim? \" you ask yourself. In an impulsive mood, youshout, \" Jim! \" He tur ns, stares blankly for several embarrassing sec-onds, and then flashes a familiar grin of recognition. Identication hasbeen made. And neither you nor Jim has examined the other 's soul. If one adopts the theory that sameness of soul confers personal identity, then one can make sense of the claim of the man whobelieved that he had in a for mer life been a raccoon. He had been araccoon if the soul he now has for merly had been the soul of a rac- 9coon. But while we may, by adopting this theory of soul, be able toattribute a meaning to his claim, we will not have succeeded in mak- ing that claim rational. T make such a claim rational, we would haveo to have some account of how it is possible to know such a thing or to have good evidence for it. And inasmuch as the very existence of soulseems so problematic, the belief that there could be objectively validcriteria for re-identifying souls seems utterly forlor n. The price ofadopting a theory of souls as personal re-identier is the abandoningof rational grounds for making identications. From an epistemological point of view, souls are idle: they play no role in our day-to-day identication of other persons. From a meta-physical point of view, positing souls as the principle of personalidentity is, as was the case with material substance, regressive. Itsimply displaces the problem of identity, but leaves it otherwiseunresolved. By arguing that person a is identical with person b if and only if the soul of a is identical to the soul of b, we have merely deferred the question, but not answered it. F r now we must ask o whether the soul of a is identical to the soul of b. And whatever way \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 9. This is of course also to assume that raccoons ' souls are not so different from persons ' souls that the one could not become the other. I shall notpursue this baroque question whether raccoons ' souls, horses ' souls, turtles 'souls, etc. are interchangeable or not. As you might suspect, I regard theexercise as ludicrous.370 Beyond Experience we might go about answering this latter question, we might well have pursued directly, that is, without having interposed the superfluousintermediary concept of soul in our attempt to answer the original question. In short, introducing the concept of soul does no useful work in helping us solve our real problems: it merely retards the progresstoward a solution. P siting soul is, thus, not going to be of much help in solving eithero the epistemological or the metaphysical problems of personal identity.W must seek another identier of persons.e The theory that it is the human body which is the identier is con- siderably more promising: it is economical in the sense that it assimi-lates the problem of personal identity to that of the identity-through-time of a particular material object, viz. a person 's own body, andit invokes no hidden or exotic substances. Moreover, it is, after all,clearly the criterion we daily use in identifying other persons. How didyou recognize Jim, and he, you? By noticing certain familiar physicalfeatures in the appearance that one presents to the rest of the world.(Human beings have an uncanny ability to recognize extremely subtlydifferent features of physiognomies.) But John Locke, recall (section 6.4 above, pp. 108ff.), argued strenuously against using the practical criterion of bodily identity asthe theoretical criterion of personal identity. Although the body maybe used as a surrogate criterion, it was not to be regarded as ultimatelysatisfactory: \" ... should the soul of a prince, carrying with it the con-sciousness of the prince 's past life, enter and infor m the body of acobbler as soon as deserted by his own soul, everyone sees he wouldbe the same person with the prince, accountable only for the prince 'sactions \" ([124], book I I, chap. X X V I I, \u00a715). The talk here of the trans- ference of soul from the prince 's body to the cobbler 's is incidental;the essential aspect is not the transference of soul - Locke is very em-phatic on this point, reiterating it several times - but the element of thetransference of consciousness . It is the transference of consciousness, alone, which makes for the transfer of the prince to the cobbler 'sbody. The identity of persons is grounded in consciousness, not soul.Indeed, Locke argues at some length that a person could successivelyhave different bodies, that a person could take tur ns sharing a bodywith another, that a person could have different souls and might evennow have the soul of some for mer person, but that none of this wouldaffect that person 's identity. F r a person 's identity is not a matter o either of body or of soul, but strictly of consciousness.P rsons 371 e F r Locke, the element of consciousness which played the crucialo role in personal identity was memory. T the extent that a person has o the memories of an earlier person, to that extent he / she may be iden-tied with that earlier person. In one of his not infrequent heroicallyconvoluted sentences, Locke writes: Had I the same consciousness that I saw the ark and Noah 's flood as that I saw an overflowing of the Thames last winter, or as that I write now, I could no more doubt that I write this now,that saw the Thames overflowed last winter, and that viewed the flood at the general deluge, was the same sel f, place that sel f in what substance you please, than I that write this am the same mysel f now whilst I write (whether I consist of all the same substance, material or immaterial, or no) that I wasyesterday. ([124], book I I, chap. X X V I I, \u00a716) More simply: \" If I had memories of seeing Noah 's Ark and the worldwide flood as well as memories of the Thames overflowing lastwinter which were as compelling as the perceptions I am now havingof writing this passage, then I could not doubt that I did indeed see the Ark and Noah 's flood and that I saw the Thames overflow last winter. \" Joseph Butler (1692-1752), writing more than thirty years after Locke 's death, challenged Locke 's theory by arguing that Locke hadgot the order of logical priority reversed, that it was personal identitywhich accounts for memory, and not the other way around: But though consciousness of what is past does thus ascertain our personal identity to ourselves, yet to say, that it makes per-sonal identity, or is necessary to our being the same persons, isto say, that a person has not existed a single moment, nor doneone action, but what he can remember; indeed none but what hereflects upon. And should one really think it self-evident, thatconsciousness of personal identity presupposes, and thereforecannot constitute, personal identity; any more than knowledge,in any other case, can constitute truth, which it presupposes.([39], 298) Memory, for Butler, is evidence for personal identity, but does not itself constitute personal identity. F r memory to be evidence of per- o372 Beyond Experience sonal identity, personal identity must itself exist independently of the evidence for it. He continues, giving voice to an intuition which isantithetical to Locke 's own: ... though present consciousness of what we at present do and feel is necessary to our being the persons we now are; yetpresent consciousness of past actions or feelings is not neces-sary to our being the same persons who perfor med those ac-tions, or had those feelings. ([39], 298) That Locke and Butler disagree, and that their disagreement stems from totally different prephilosophical beliefs about the centrality of 10the concept of memory to the concept of person, is apparent. But is this the end of the matter? Must this debate simply be regarded as aclash of intuitions, and must it be left at that? In the very last paragraph of his essay, almost as an afterthought, Butler raises an issue which has come to be seen as essential in tack-ling these problems. F r Butler reminds us that memories can be mis- o taken. And although Butler, himself, does not particularly pursue this problem, it really does pose a crucial difculty for Locke 's theory. According to Locke, personal identity is constituted by memory. But what if one 's memory is mistaken? What if someone is convincedthat he recalls something, but his report is about an event at which hecould not possibly have been present? ( This need not be regarded as apathological condition. All of us have mistaken memories about somethings. Sometimes we might believe that a dream was a ' real 'memory. And moder n empirical research has shown just how mucheyewitness accounts of ' one and the same event ', even among persons \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 10. Compare Butler with Hume (publishing three years later [1739]): \" Who can tell me, for instance, what were his thoughts and actions on the rst ofJanuary 1715, the 11th of March 1719, and the 3d of August 1733? ... Will he afr m, because he has entirely forgot the incidents of these days, that thepresent self is not the same person with the self of that time; and by thatmeans overtur n all the most establish 'd notions of personal identity? In thisview, therefore, memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity. ... 'Twill be incumbent on those, who afr m that memory producesentirely our personal identity, to give reason why we can thus extend ouridentity beyond our memory \" ([101], book I, part I V, sect. V I, 262).P rsons 373 e who are trying their level best to be scrupulously honest, can differ markedly.) Locke 's own example is of someone ( himself, of all people) pos- sibly recalling having witnessed the biblical Flood. Locke certainly isconsistent: he allows that any person who has such memories waspresent at the Flood. Most other persons, from Butler onwards, are far less likely to be quite so liberal. W re any of us to meet someone who claimed to have e been present at the Flood, most of us, I am sure, would be skeptical inthe extreme, probably believing in the rst instance that the personmaking the claim was mentally ill or suffering some sort of delusion.Does this mean that one must, then, adopt Butler 's theory, that per-sonal identity is the basis for memory, and reject Locke 's, that mem-ory is the basis for personal identity? That there is a problem in Locke 's theory does not, of course, mean that Butler 's opposing theory is correct. Butler 's would be the pre-ferred theory only if these two theories were the only ones possible.But they are not. And indeed, what I want to suggest is that what isneeded is not the wholesale rejection of Locke 's theory, but a repair. I am convinced, like Locke, that memory does play a central role in personal identity. But the role cannot be as simple and direct as Lockeimagined. F r Locke 's insights can be invoked only for correct mem- o ory (or veridical memory, as it is sometimes called), and not for mis-taken (or falsidical) memory. But what is the test of veridical memory? W have already explored e this question (in section 8.10, pp. 220ff.). There I argued that one wayto test memories is to compare one 's own ' seeming ' memories withthose of other persons. If they agree, then one has good prima facieevidence of the correctness of one 's own memories. But what ifothers ' memories do not bear out one 's own, or what if other personswere not witnesses to the event you believe you recall, or what if -even more extremely - your memory is of an event predating the birthof anyone alive today? How then shall it be tested? As I argued ear-lier: by consulting the testimony provided by physical facts. Ultimate-ly the reliability of memory, and our ability to sort out veridical fromfalsidical memories, at some point must rely on the evidence of thephysical world. If this were a world where persons never had bodies, where they were just thinking things, then one might want to argue that insofaras there would be no way to distinguish veridical from falsidicalmemories, there would not be such a distinction, and that having a374 Beyond Experience memory, any memory however wild or bizarre, would then be a mem- ory of one 's own personal history. But such a world is vastly differentfrom this world. In the last few decades, there has been a marked shift in much writ- ing about personal identity. Whereas in centuries past philosopherswere disposed to ground personal identity in souls, in substance, andother empirically problematical entities, many recent philosophers aredisposed to seat personal identity, as did Locke, in memory and, manywould add, personality. But they do not rest there. There is more tothe concept of personal identity. Not just any memory, or seemingmemory, will do. It must be authentic, or veridical, memory. And formemory to be veridical, we normally require that the body (of the per-son whose memory it is) was present at the remembered event. Inshort, although the body is not the identier itself, it plays a crucialrole in determining the authenticity of the identier, viz. memory andpersonality. P rsons are essentially identied by their personalities and by theire authentic (veridical) memories. But for memories to be authentic, theperson must be embodied, i.e. the test of cogency of memories de-pends on causal links in the physical world. ( This is not, of course, toargue that memories are not themselves physical entities. They maybe. As we saw in chapter 10, memories perhaps are states of our cen-tral nervous systems. But the theory of personal identity being pro-posed here does not require any particular decision in that latter case.All that is required is that memories - whatever their ontological fate,whether regarded as themselves physical states or not - be testable by the evidence furnished by physical states.) Interestingly, another consideration, from quite another direction, also favors the theory that persons must be embodied. Recall our ear-lier discussion (p. 131) of Plato 's allegory of the cave. There I arguedthat were persons not to be embodied, they could not tell ' themselves 'apart from ' other persons ', there could be no concept of personal identity. What is emerging is a theory of personal identity which to a certain degree mirrors that of physical object identity. What confers identityis not the endurance of a mental or spiritual substance, but a succes-sion of ' person-stages ' unied, or integrated, by certain sorts ofrelationships they bear to one another. Hume had grasped a fragment of this moder n account. He, too, con- ceived of personal identity as a series, a succession, of stages. WhenP rsons 375 e he looked for the ' organizing principle ' he singled out a pair of rela- tions which together he supposed conferred the identity: resemblanceand causation. But these relations will not do. The role of causation isoverstated. Some items in the stream of consciousness may causally bring about their successors, but an equal if not greater number ofthese episodes are induced by external stimuli. And resemblance fareslittle better. F r what is the memory but a faculty, by which we raise upo images of past perceptions? And as an image necessarily re-sembles its object, must not the frequent placing of theseresembling perceptions in the chain of thought, convey theimagination more easily from one link to another, and make thewhole seem like the continuance of one object? In this particu-lar, then, the memory not only discovers the identity, but alsocontributes to its production, by producing the relation ofresemblance among the perceptions. ([101], book I, part I V, sect. V I, 260-1) In commenting on this passage, Quinton offers this counterexample: \" Suppose two men, A and B, take tur ns looking through a keyhole atmoments 1 and 2. Then experiences A1 and B2 will probably be morealike than A1 and A2 or B1 and B2 \" ([165], 320). Quinton seems tobe suggesting that Hume had argued that the relation of similarity wassupposed to obtain between a person 's successive perceptions. But that is not what Hume claimed (at least it is not what I take him to bewriting in the passage above). Rather Hume claimed that in the streamof consciousness there will recur similar episodes (not necessarily suc-cessive to one another), and it is these recurring and similar episodeswhich contribute to the appearance of a unity. The precise interpretation is a quibble, however. F r it is clear that o resemblance among the episodes in the stream of consciousness,whether those episodes are neighboring ones or remote from oneanother, will not unify the series. The point is that the series will beunied if the episodes are those of one person, and it will not beunied if the episodes - however much alike, regardless whetherimmediate neighbors or remote in time from one another - are thoseof different persons. Y u and I might at virtually the same time have o qualitatively identical perceptions of a scene, and yet your perceptionis yours and mine is mine. And nothing intrinsic to our perceptions -376 Beyond Experience certainly not any relation of similarity (or dissimilarity) obtaining be- tween the two - accounts for the one 's being mine, and the other 'sbeing yours. Any viable theory of personal identity is going to have to accom- modate a remarkable variety of data. - Introspection does not seem to reveal any organizing ' prin- ciple ' (e.g. soul). - Different persons, a and b, may have experiences, e and e , a b which are more alike one another than those experiences are like other experiences of a and of b respectively. - P rsonality and veridical memory seem to play a crucial role ine determining a person 's identity. - That a memory is veridical can be objectively established only if a person is (or at least has been) embodied. - If persons are not embodied, then there is no objective test for distinguishing between self, hallucinatory ' other persons ', andgenuine other persons. Without a body, the distinction between' self ' and ' other ' collapses. - W virtually always use, as our practical criterion of personale identity (particularly that of other persons), the bodily criterion. - It is perfectly intelligible to describe two persons swapping bodies. Few of us have any difculty imagining ourselves hav-ing ( being housed in?) a different body. The body, then, is notthe ultimate, or sole, criterion of personal identity. - Memories are constantly being lost. Some of what I did remem- ber yesterday, and some of what I could have remembered yes-terday, I cannot recall today. Some memories are very long-lasting; but others fall away. Memories may be likened to thephysical parts of an object which are from time to time dis-carded and replaced by others. But whereas physical parts areoften replaced by qualitatively identical parts, the greater partof our store of memories often changes markedly over a periodof years. - Both memories and personality traits are dispositional . Each of us is capable of recalling vastly greater numbers of events thanany of us actually recalls at any one moment. Each of us actsand reacts to situations in idiosyncratic (personal) ways, butonly one, or very few, of these will be exhibited at any onetime. That is, the bulk of one 's own memories and personalitylies dormant, metaphorically speaking, ready to be activated,P rsons 377 e but generally is not manifest. The only respectable theories we have of the nature of (instanced) dispositions are theories whichwould make of them (instanced) properties of some persisting,or enduring, thing. In the case of memories and personality, thiswould mean that memories and personality must be seated in' something ' which endures. If souls are not to be invoked forthis latter role, then the most plausible alter native candidate isan enduring physical body. And of physical bodies, the humancentral nervous system is, by far, the most attractive and likelycandidate to ll the role. The ter m \" personality \" bears intimate etymological ties to \" person- hood \". That it does attests to some of the metaphysics built into ourlanguage. But for the moment, I do not wish to invoke this question-begging aspect of \" personality \". I want to use the ter m \" personality \"in a more neutral way, without presupposing that personality is con-ceptually tied to the concept of personhood. Let us, then, for a while,suspend our recognition of the verbal link, and let us conceive of per-sons ' personalities as the characteristic ways they react to situations.Obviously, one 's character (one 's moral and ethical dispositions) ispart of one 's personality, but \" character \" and \" personality \" are notsynonyms. It may be part of your personality to like piano sonority,but we would not be much inclined to regard that liking as part ofyour character. In any event, for a moment, let 's use \" personality \" asan abbreviation for \" characteristic behavior \". Imagine a world where the personalities (as just dened) and the memories of persons could be swapped between bodies. Assume, too,that such swapping occurred universally, quite naturally, i.e. as anoperation of Nature itself, to all persons, every day, worldwide at localnoon. What sort of social practices would a society have to institute to cope with such a phenomenon? Suppose a woman left her house at8:00 A M. At noon her personality and memories are suddenly switched to another body. (W 'll assume that body switching is always from e male to male and female to female, youngster to youngster, and seniorto senior.) At 4:00 P M she sets out for home. Which house should she retur n to: the house she recalls leaving that mor ning, or the housefrom which her body departed that mor ning? (Since she has no memo-ry of the house from which her body would have departed, we wouldhave to assume that were the latter alter native to be the adopted one,human bodies would have to be tattooed with their home addresses.)378 Beyond Experience I think most of us would be strongly inclined to opt for the rst alter native, arguing that personhood is carried by personality and bymemories, not by body. W re we to adopt this suggestion, then in the e world just described, the practical criterion of identifying persons bytheir bodies would be fairly useless (it would never work over a timeinterval of twenty-four hours). Instead we would probably set up somemanner of greeting one another whereby we would exchange namesor other infor mation which would uniquely identify ourselves to oneanother. Of course, there is no necessity - either physical or logical - to adopt the practice just described. A society theoretically could adoptthe second practice, i.e. of identifying persons by their bodies, not bytheir personalities and memories. In such a society, when husband andwife greeted one another each evening, the bodies retur ning homewould be those pictured in the photograph on the mantle, but the inter-ests, memories, and personality of each person would be entirely unfa-miliar to the other. Such a practice might work. (And some amongyou might even be intrigued by the prospects, believing that it wouldrelieve the humdrum in ordinary life and make the principal causes ofmarital breakdown disappear at a stroke.) But the fact is that the con-cept of personhood which would be implicit in this latter practice isnot the concept we use. In this world, in our circumstances, we con-ceive of personhood as seated, not in body, but in personality andmemory. How can we tie this all together? I suggest in this way. Our concept of person is built on the requirement that identity of persons is secured through (genuine) memory and personality. (W will explore each of e these requirements further in the subsequent two case studies.) Butpersonality and genuine memory presuppose embodiment. P rsons e must be embodied in order to individuate them and in order to distin-guish genuine memory from hallucination and delusion. But this is notto say that a person must have exactly one body throughout his / herlifetime. The requirement of embodiment is satisable by a person 'shaving a succession of bodies. What is essential is memory and per-sonality, but that memory and personality must be embodied. This criterion conceals several imprecisions. From day to day we might recall the greater part of what we could recall the previous day.T day 's memories are fairly similar to those of yesterday. But thiso similarity of memories, from day to day, does not hold for days muchfurther separated. When relatives tell me of things I did when a tod-dler, I have no memory at all of having done them. I can, today, recallP rsons 379 e nothing whatsoever of my fourth birthday. There is certainly a spatio- temporal continuity between that youngster 's body and my own: I stillbear the physical scars of some of his mishaps. But am I to beregarded as the same person as that four-year-old of yesteryear? I am sure intuitions will diverge signicantly on how to answer this latterquestion. And even among persons who will want to insist that theadult is the ' same person ' as the for mer child, there may well be adebate as to whether their grounds for saying this depend on theirmaking the identication on the basis of the spatiotemporal continuityof the human body or whether they depend on there having been aday-to-day ( but not year-to-year) similarity of memories and per-sonality. There will inevitably be a strong temptation to assimilate this present conundrum to that examined earlier, viz. Hobbes 's version ofthe problem of the ship of Theseus (pp. 347ff.). In that earlierinstance, there were two competing criteria of identity: the spatiotem-poral one and the compositional one (i.e. the criterion of re-identica-tion by material parts). I argued that the for mer is primary, but insituations where it is inapplicable, then it is appropriate to fall backupon the latter criterion. W re we to apply that sort of reasoning to the e present case, we might argue that inasmuch as the adult cannot re-member having been the child (i.e. where the criterion of continuity ofmemory and of personality is not satised), one may fall back uponthe strictly physical criterion of the spatiotemporal continuity of thehuman body. But the analogy is not nearly so simple. There are profound im- plications in identifying persons. Locke war ned of the danger in ourfalling back upon the bodily criterion of personal identity. F r in- o stance, he considered it an abomination to punish a person for mis-deeds of which he had no memory: ... if it is possible for the same man [i.e. human being] to have distinct incommunicable consciousness at different times, it ispast doubt the same man would at different times make differ-ent persons; which, we see, is the sense of mankind in thesolemnest declaration of their opinions, human laws not pun-ishing the mad man for the sober man 's [i.e. the normal man 's] actions, nor the sober man for what the mad man did ... . ([124], book I I, chap. X X V I I, \u00a720, 287-8) There is something deeply troubling in the prospect of punishing a380 Beyond Experience 11person for a crime of which he has utterly no memory. The spectacle of a person suffering a heavy ne, or sitting in a jail cell, for havingdone something which he cannot recall at all strikes many of us as amiscarriage of justice. There can be no contrition by a person who hasno memory of having committed an offense; there can be no personalguilt. Thus, the decision to use the bodily criterion of personal identity as a fallback option must not be undertaken lightly. It is not a mere con-venience. Adopting the bodily criterion of personal identity in cases \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 11. There are exceptions. Locke, himself, allowed for the case of punishing a person who committed an offense while intoxicated. But Locke was troubledover the rationale, or justication, for this practice. He believed that punish-ment was permissible because we \" cannot distinguish certainly what is real,what counterfeit [in cases of drunkenness or sleepwalking]; and so the igno-rance in drunkenness or sleep is not admitted as a plea \" ([124], book I I, chap. X X V I I, \u00a722). This is certainly a wretched justication for our legal practice. (I will ignore the case of the sleepwalker and concentrate solely on the case ofthe offense committed while intoxicated.) Locke argues that since there is noway to prove that a person who claims ignorance of his drunken actions istelling the truth, it is permissible to punish him. This seems to have tur ned theprinciple of ' innocent until proved guilty ' on its head, placing the burden ofhaving to prove himself innocent on the accused instead of placing the bur-den of having to prove the accused guilty on the prosecution. Locke defendsthis violation of the principle on the grounds that on \" the Great Day \" (i.e.Judgment Day), it will all be put right. ( But see section 12.8 in this chapter.) There is, however, a far more reasonable justication - stemming from Aristotle ([11], book I I I, 1113b29-1114a3) - for punishing a person for his offenses while drunk even if he cannot now recall committing those offenses.When persons choose to drink alcohol, they do so in full knowledge that they might commit an offense and might lose the memory of having done so. Thesubsequent loss of memory is not something which just randomly happens tobefall the drinker; quite the contrary, he chose to do something (drinkalcohol) which he knew might very well blot out memory. It is this aspect ofthe affair - knowingly taking a drug which might precipitate one 's commit-ting an offense and which also might blot out one 's memory - which justiesour subsequently holding the person responsible for his misdeed. If we didnot have such a practice, then if there were a memory-erasing drug, anyonecould absolve himself of guilt by taking that drug after having committed acrime and wiping clean his memory of the offense. I think few of us would beinclined to regard his after-the-fact self-induced loss of memory as warrant-ing the dropping of proceedings against him.P rsons 381 e where the criterion of continuity of memory and personality is inap- 12plicable has profound legal implications. In any event, it is not my purpose to pursue the nuances of legal reasoning. I am prepared to leave the debate at this point, to retur n toan exploration of some of the other implications of adopting the sortof analysis which has been evolving here. In the course of the ensuingcase studies, I will try to expose something more of the vagueness ofthe concept of identity and will suggest that the idea that there is, orcan be, some precise notion as to the complete set of essential ingredi-ents in the concept of personal identity is impossible to realize. 12.6 Case study: Tim 's plaintOne of my closest friends in graduate school was a history buff. Tim (not his real name) felt himself a mist in the then-current (viz. thetwentieth) century. He loathed the pace of life, the congestion, andespecially the suffering and devastation wrought by moder n warfare.Often, in perfect seriousness, he would lament to me that he had beenbor n in the wrong century. Tim sincerely wished that he had beenbor n in and had lived his entire life in the seventeenth century, whoselife-style he regarded as being far better suited to his own particular 13temperament, needs, and attitudes. On those occasions (in 1963), when Tim would begin to express such unrealizable desires, I was fully prepared to enter with him intohis fantasy and to ' play ' by his rules. At that time my usual responsewas to remind him of all the benets which living in the twentiethcentury bestowed and of all the advantages persons living in theseventeenth century did without. I reminded him that he had been \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 12. It is interesting that we probably would feel rather more sanguine about adopting the bodily criterion where the consequence would be the bestowingof a good rather than the exacting of a punishment. Those of us who mightprotest the punishing of a man who had no memory of having committed anoffense might be far less moved to complain in the case of an adult 's inherit-ing a legacy even though he has lost his memory of having earlier been thechild whom the legator had originally designated as being the recipient. 13. Tim wanted to have been bor n earlier, not to have never been bor n at all. Bernard Williams reports that there is an ' old Jewish reply ' to the latterrequest, i.e. to have never been bor n. It is: \" How many are so lucky? Not onein ten thousand \" ([212], 232).382 Beyond Experience seriously ill a few years earlier and that moder n pharmaceuticals had saved his life. P rsons in the seventeenth century who had such e illnesses never recovered. And I reminded him, too, that personsliving in the seventeenth century knew nothing of the music of Bee-thoven, Schubert, Brahms, Dvorak, V rdi, Puccini, Prokoev, W ill, ee Gershwin, and Brel. P rsons living in the seventeenth century were e ignorant of the writings of Hemingway, T lstoy, Dostoevsky, and o Dickens. They would never have heard voices of Caruso, Gigli,Galli-Curci, Robeson, Bjoerling, Milanov, Piaf, heard performances by Heifetz, Horowitz, andGould. They would never have seen the lms of Bergmann, of W lles, e and of Hitchcock. They would never have savored the wit of WilliamGilbert, Ogden Nash, and Lewis Carroll. They would never have seenthe sculptures and paintings of Rodin, Picasso, and Miro. And the listwent on and on. That was half a lifetime ago. As you can see, my argument, then, focused on selling the triumphs of our own times, and it involved arecitation of a variety of highlights of the previous one hundred yearsor so. In the intervening decades, however, I have often reflected onTim 's plaint, and I have come to have a totally different perspective. Earlier (in section 8.11) I argued that the concept of accelerated backward time travel is perfectly logically coherent. W can, with per- e fect consistency, describe an adult who travels backward in time, letus say from the twentieth century to the seventeenth, and there livesseveral years, perhaps even the rest of his life. But traveling backwardin time from the twentieth to the seventeenth century was not whatTim had wanted. Tim wanted to have been bor n in the seventeenthcentury and to have lived his entire life in the seventeenth century,having the experiences and the knowledge of a seventeenth-centuryman. He wanted to have had the memories of having grown up in theseventeenth century and to have had no knowledge whatever concer n-ing what the future would hold for subsequent centuries. In short, hewanted to have been , not a time traveler to, but an inhabitant of, the seventeenth century. ( The fact that he would not be alive in 1963 [theyear in which we spoke of these matters], and indeed would have beendead for more than 250 years, did not trouble him in the least.) Tim and I had not thought through his daydream in a careful, criti- cal manner. W assumed that Tim was making sense, that what he e wanted, although bizarre and physically impossible, was neverthelesslogically possible. But his expressed desire was, even though the twoof us may have thought otherwise, subtly incoherent on virtually anyP rsons 383 e viable account of what it is to be a person. (And that it was stands as a object lesson in the possibility of engaging in incoherent discourse.Some self-contradictory desires are very unobvious: their incoherenceemerges only upon thoughtful and deliberate probing.) And thustoday, were someone to express a similar desire, I would challenge iton altogether different grounds: not on the practical or aestheticgrounds that in living in the seventeenth century one would have toforgo so much that is valuable in the twenty-rst century, but on thelogical grounds that no one alive today could possibly have lived inthe seventeenth century. F r Tim, or any other contemporary person, o to want to have lived in the seventeenth century is of the same order ofdesire as wanting there to be a ve-sided square or a colorless redapple. Such things, because their descriptions are self-contradictory,logically cannot possibly occur. One way to focus on the incoherence is to try to imagine what it would be like, not for some anonymous other person to have lived his /her entire life in the seventeenth century, but for you yourself to have 14done so. Suppose this week an historian were to nd both a portrait and a detailed diary of some seventeenth-century person. The painting isremarkable. It is of virtually photographic quality and it displays aperson who, in outward appearance, is your physical double. And thediary is equally remarkable. It reveals a person who, knowing nothingwhat you know of the twenty-rst century, reacts to the events andpersons of the seventeenth century in much the way that you react tosimilar persons and events in the twenty-rst. Could this earlier person have been you? Suppose the current-you (i.e. the you alive today) had never been bor n. W uld this earlier per- o son, this seventeenth century look-alike and act-alike (to coin a word),have been you? Is it enough for a person to look like you and to act like you to really be (or to have been) you? If you are not quite sure how you want to answer this question, try \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 14. I have often heard Professor Jonathan Bennett urge the ' rst-person ' test for various theories of personal identity. He cautions, for example, that onecan imagine what it might be like for another person to undergo ' splitting '(mitosis), but one cannot, Bennett has argued, be so sanguine when it comesto imagining it of oneself. \" Imagine your body undergoing mitosis duringsleep. On which side of the bed would you wake up? \" Bennett argues that you cannot imagine yoursel f waking up on both sides.384 Beyond Experience switching the centuries. Suppose, instead, that you were to be told by a seer, who has a perfect track record in all her short-ter m predictions,that sometime in the far future there will be a person who will looklike you and who will act like you, but who will have no memories ofyou, or even for that matter any secondhand knowledge of your hav- 15ing lived earlier. Suppose you are inclined to believe the seer. That still leaves open the question what you are to infer from her predic- tion. W uld you regard this future person as you? W uld you now feel oo that somehow you will escape earthly death to be rebor n (resurrected,reincarnated, or what you will) in the future? Can you identify your-self with this future person, believing that that person is a future stage 16of you? I think most of us will resist the suggestion that such a future person could ' really ' be oneself. If you do not share this intuition, then perhaps you might ask your- self how you would react to the news that someone who looks andacts just like you lives some four thousand miles away, right now, atthis very moment. Suppose you were to meet that person. W uld you o be meeting a look-alike; or would you be meeting yoursel f ? I think most of us, even if we were hesitant about the for mer cases - of theearlier and the later look-alikes - would be more reluctant still toacknowledge this contemporary person as being onesel f. Our concept of sel f simply does not allow that we should lear n that we exist not only here and now (e.g. in 2001 in British Columbia), but - surprise! -also at some distant place, e.g. in Moscow or in P ris. I may have a a look-alike in P ris, he may even act remarkably like me, but whatever a 17else is true of him, it surely is not that he is me. In saying this, I am of course appealing to your own sense of iden- tity, and am assuming that, for most of us, our reactions and intuitions \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 15. If the spectacle of a seer is too much for your skeptical imagination, you might alter the example to that of a time traveler who has met this future per-son and brings back to you rsthand knowledge of your future look-alike. 16. If you are comfortable with the notion that time travel is coherent, then ask yourself what if this future person were to enter a time machine and wereto travel back in time to the here-and-now and were to confront you face toface? W uld you be shaking hands with yourself ?o 17. Recall Dickens 's A T le of Two Cities . The case is more problematic, a however, if the two persons share similar thoughts. Lor ne Michaels (one ofthe producers of the television show \" Saturday Night Live \") jokingly told thestory that he had \"become obsessed with the notion that somewhere in theP rsons 385 e would be pretty much the same for the circumstances described. This is not to say that if your philosophical intuitions are radically differentfrom mine then they are, somehow, wrong. The point of the exerciseis not to judge a particular concept of personal identity right or wrong,but to try to bring into focus what one 's concept of personal identityis. If your concept of personal identity is enough like mine to causeyou to withhold identifying yourself with some for mer, later, or dis-tant person just on the basis of similarity of features and of per- 18sonality, then you, like me, will nd Tim 's request incoherent. F r some person to be Tim (or to be you), it is not sufcient that o that person share Tim 's (or your) physical appearance and personality.Clearly something more is needed. (If not, then you could - even atthis very moment - theoretically, if not in actual fact, exist at severalwidely separated places, e.g. London, P ris, or Moscow, having en- a tirely different sets of experiences.) But I think most of us will beprepared to reply to the suggestion that we might be in several differ-ent bodies in several different places all at the same time by rejectingthe suggestion, not as false, but as incoherent, i.e. as logically impos-sible. The suggestion is inconsistent with our concept of what it is tobe a person. 12.7 What more might there be to the concept of personal 19identity? Tim 's imagining that he could have lived in the seventeenth century overlooks certain ingredients which are essential to personal identity.That there might have been someone who looked and acted like Timwas certainly insufcient for that person to have been Tim. Some- thing, perhaps a considerable amount, more is required for personalidentity. I have earlier suggested that the ' something more ' which is \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 world there was a person having the exact same thought he was at exactly the same moment. He decided to call that person, but the line was busy\" ([95],36, footnote). W uld even this establish the identity of the two persons? o 18. See (i) Thomas Nagel, \" Death \" ([141], 67) and (ii) Derek P rt, \" How a Our Identity in F ct Depends on When W W re Conceived \" ([149], \u00a7119, ae e 351-6). 19. My thoughts about the topic of this section are in a state of flux and hence the discussion below is at best tentative. Thus, this particular sectionshould be read with more than the usual degree of forbearance.386 Beyond Experience required includes veridical memory. Without veridical memory, there cannot be personal identity. But are these two ' dimensions ' all there is to personal identity? Does sharing veridical memories with, and having much the same per-sonality as, an earlier person sufce to make the later person identicalwith the earlier? Many writers have assumed that veridical memoryand shared personality comprise a set of sufcient conditions for iden-tity of persons. But some writers are not satised with even these twofairly rigorous requirements; they believe that yet more, or somethingquite different, is required for personal identity. Saul Kripke, for example, has argued that being bor n of the parents one actually has is a necessary condition for being the person one is.Y u could not possibly be identied with anyone having parents dif-o ferent from your own. Using Elizabeth I I as his example, he writes: How could a person originating from different parents, from a totally different sper m and egg, be this very woman ? One can imagine, given this woman, that various things in her life could have changed [i.e. been different]: that she should have becomea pauper; that her royal blood should have been unknown, andso on. One is given, let 's say, a previous history of the world upto a certain time, and from that time it diverges considerablyfrom the actual course. This seems to be possible. And so it 'spossible that even though she were bor n of these parents shenever became queen. Even though she were bor n of theseparents, like Mark Twain 's character [footnote: in The Prince and the P uper ] she was switched off [exchanged] with anothera girl. But what is harder to imagine is her being bor n of differentparents. It seems to me that anything coming from a differentorigin would not be this object. ([116], 113) F r Kripke, Tim 's plaint - whatever else might have been incoherento about it - would have been impossible because it imagined that some-one having different parents from Tim 's could, nonetheless, have beenTim. F r Kripke, no one bor n in the seventeenth century could pos-o sibly have been Tim, since no one bor n in the seventeenth century wasthe child of Tim 's parents. In a recent article in Psychology T day , Russell Belk, reporting ono some recent experimental studies, writes: What we possess is, in a very real way, part of ourselves. OurP rsons 387 e thoughts and our bodies are normally the most central part of our self-concept. But next in importance are what we do - ouroccupations and skills - and what we have - our unique set ofpossessions. ... W generally include four types of possessions e in our personal sense of self: body and body parts, objects,places and time periods, persons and pets. ... W found that e academics were especially likely to cite books as favoritepossessions, perhaps because they represent the knowledge onwhich their work is based. F r other people, sporting goods o represent what they can or could do ... Many studies haveshown that the loss of possessions that follows natural disastersor that occurs when elderly people are put in institutions isoften traumatic. What people feel in these circumstances is,quite literally, a loss of self. ([25], 51-2) In Belk 's view, for some persons the loss of material possessions (in- cluding external bodily parts) will constitute a radical discontinuity insel f. John P rry, in his estimable A Dialogue on P rsonal Identity and e e Immortality ([151]), presents to us the dying Gretchen W irob. Her e body has been fatally injured and will soon die. On her deathbed, shehas been offered the choice of having her intact brain transplanted intothe healthy body of a brain-dead patient. She refuses on the groundsthat she cannot identify herself now with the future person who willhave her brain but not her (present) body; that is, she has no anticipa- tion of being that later person. Here P rry jolts our intuitions. Al- e though he does not pursue the question explicitly, there is in the dia-logue at least the suggestion that there is a certain symmetry between anticipation and memory in determining personal identity. Virtually all discussions of personal identity involve cases of re- identication, i.e. of identifying later person(-stages) with earlier ones.But why this particular prejudice or bias? Why are there not equalnumbers of discussions of pre-identication, i.e. of identifying earlier person(-stages) with later ones? Should the anticipating of being afuture person - as sometimes occurs in discussions of eschatology* -be factored into the equation of personal identity on an equal footingwith memories of having been a past person? As we collect these many suggestions - Kripke 's, Belk 's, P rry 's, e and others ' - as to further (or different) necessary conditions for per-sonal identity - having the parents one does, owning the things onedoes, having an anticipation of being some future person - difcult388 Beyond Experience and disturbing questions arise about the very practice itself of meta- physics. There is always a desire in doing philosophy to construct economi- cal theories, ones which seek the minimum set of conditions which areindividually necessary and jointly (i.e. altogether) sufcient for thecorrect application of a concept. In analyzing the concept of personal identity it is natural to want an analysis which is as neat and tidy and free from loose ends as is possible. And thus there is a strong tempta-tion to nd grounds on which to reject most suggestions forthcomingas to further necessary conditions for personal identity. W want to be e able to say: \" These conditions, x, y, and z, are necessary; any further conditions are superfluous or redundant. \" Thus, a while ago, when I and several of my colleagues were dis- cussing W irob 's claim that she would not be identical with a future e person who had her memories and personality but not her body, someof my colleagues argued that W irob was simply mistaken: that when e the surgery ( brain-transplant) had been completed, and the patientwoke out of anesthesia, that patient would recall having been W irob e and would insist that identity had been preserved. In short, these col-leagues were prepared to tell the dying W irob that she was mistaken , e that she would survive if she would but consent to the surgery. Inother words, some of my colleagues were prepared to place their owntheory of personal identity above that of W irob. e Is there some ' objective ' theory of personal identity whose essen- tials might be grasped and the adoption of which would warrant ourtelling someone that he or she was wrong in conceiving of himself orherself in some particular way? Not too many years ago, I myself argued in just the way my col- leagues argued. I, too, believed that W irob was simply mistaken: that e hers was an incorrect view of personal identity, and that she had made a mistake not unlike believing that squares must be red or that materialobjects must be soluble in water. Her error, I thought, consisted inbelieving that some feature (anticipation, in this case) was necessaryto the concept of personal identity when in fact it was not. I no longer am so ready to insist on that particular view of the phi- losophical enterprise. W re someone to suggest that all squares must e be red, I would be quick to object, arguing that that person had got theconcept of square wrong. And the reason I would be comfortable arguing in that way would be because I do believe that the concept ofsquare is fairly universally shared, that most of us do have virtuallythe identical concept of squareness . And in other cases, I might objectP rsons 389 e to someone 's analysis - an analysis of probability , for example - on the basis that it was inferior to others or that it did not work particular-ly well, e.g. was confused or clumsy or applicable to too few circum-stances. That is, in some cases I am prepared to argue that certainanalyses of a given concept are better than, or preferable to, certainothers. But the concept of personal identity seems to me to be different. Indeed it now seems to me something of a mistake to talk or writeabout ' the ' concept of identity. The more I read what other personshave written, and the more I talk with my students about their ownconcepts of personal identity, the greater looms the diversity betweenthe many variants of the concept. The concept of identity which is used in Law is probably a fairly minimal concept in that it invokes a minimal set of necessary condi-tions. ( The Law could not function with a highly variable concept ofpersonhood, no more than it could function with a highly variableconcept of property or responsibility .) But this same concept may not be particularly useful, for example, in psychiatry, where a patientwhose memory is intact may feel himself totally detached from earlieractions. I think philosophers err if they believe that they can construct some one viable theory of personal identity. That particular goal is as illu-sory as trying to construct some one theory of, for example, what con-stitutes quality in music or beauty in art. The trouble is that if we lookbroadly across our culture, and particularly if we step outside it, wend immense differences in the prephilosophical intuitions persons 20have about personal identity. The occupational danger for philoso-phers lies in our too often creating philosophy for other philosophers,indeed not even for all other philosophers, but only for philosopherswho belong to the same ' school '. The hazards of inbreeding and oftunnel vision are ever-present. I remain convinced that memory and personality are the essential \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 20. A great many articles and books published by psychiatrists and psychologists treating the concept of sel f arise out of their clinical experience with patients who have ' immature ', ' defective ', or even ' pathological ' con-cepts of sel f. One must beware, however, not to draw from these writings the idea that the diversity of concepts of sel f arises out of arrested growth or psychological disorder. When we talk with persons whose concept of sel f is in no way dysfunctional, we nd an equally prodigious range of difference.390 Beyond Experience core of the concept of personal identity. But I am no longer so sure that other factors might not also play an important role, and I am notcondent that there are not, in fact, a great number of diverse, yet via-ble, concepts of personal identity, some of which are not merely dif-ferent from one another, but even incompatible. In short, I am makinga plea for tolerance in the matter of explicating the concept of identity.I think it hopeless, and indeed inappropriate, to argue that there is, orcould be, one best concept of personal identity. Our concepts of per-sonal identity are too varied to allow a single reconstruction. With this said, I tur n to our closing case study. If personal identity is not carried by a changeless soul, if personal identity requires con-tinuity of memory and preservation of personality, and if personality,in tur n, includes such things as intense desires and mental capacities,then there are some profound consequences in the changing of per-sons ' desires and mental capacities. 2112.8 Case study: Can there be justice after death? There are, I think, two principal egoistic motives which prompt us to desire an afterlife: a desire to maintain what is valued in our lives -including perhaps, but hardly limited to, the sensual, the intellectual,and the aesthetic - and a desire to achieve what we wanted but did nothave in life - including perhaps, but hardly limited to, material goods,honor, power, creative talents, and physical abilities. But for many persons, the desire that there be an afterlife is in part motivated by reasons which transcend individual, personal considera-tions. This world, we all know - and are constantly reminded through-out the day on the electronic news media and in the newspapers - isunfair. Indeed the world is grossly unfair. A catalogue of its injusticesranges widely from physical handicaps, sickness, and grief to starva-tion, slavery, flood, avalanche, wanton acts of terrorism, and so on soas to overwhelm the imagination. Doubtless many of us nd the notion of an afterlife appealing, not just because it holds out the promise of thwarting eternal personalNothingness, but equally - and probably for some of us, even morestrongly - because it offers the prospect of nally putting right theinjustice in this world. It is in the afterlife, we have been so often \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 21. This section is a revised version of an essay which originally appeared in [104].P rsons 391 e propagandized by religion, that virtue will be rewarded and evil punished. Our sense of morality craves this, whether or not it is in factactual or even, for that matter, possible. Usual philosophical discussions of justice concer n the problems of realizing greater justice in this world. Such discussions typically relyheavily on specifying, and trying to work within, a variety of con-straints: ignorance, scarcity of goods, legal systems, and - althoughoften overlooked - physical possibility itself. Indeed so pervasive isthe constraint of physical possibility, it hardly even is acknowledged.It is simply an unarticulated presupposition. But what happens if one seeks to maximize justice in a world (e.g. the afterlife) which is not subject to these usual kinds of constraints?In an afterlife (heaven or hell or some other place), could the Dis-penser of Justice (whether an individual or several minds workingtogether) achieve perfect justice? What if, by simply willing it, theDispenser of Justice could bring into existence any number and vari-ety of goods? What if, that is, there were not scarcity but inniteplenitude? What if physical possibility were to become coextensive*with logical possibility, i.e. the only constraint on the actual (afterlifeactual, that is, not this-world actual) were the requirement that noself-inconsistency were to be realized? What if every veil of ignorance 22were to be lifted? What if, that is, we should all know - if not every-thing - at least whatever we wanted to know? What if, in particular,every person 's every deed were known? What if every person 's everydesire, doubt, hope, longing, envy, animosity, lust, love, were alsoknown? Could an omniscient, omnipotent Dispenser of Justice bring about perfect justice under these circumstances? Many religious believers,for millennia, have thought so. I nd it difcult to share such opti-mism. Even in the afterlife, perfect justice - I am afraid - is unrealiz-able. My pessimism stems from several considerations. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 22. Although I will not pursue the matter here, I must mention that an afterlife in which this world 's physical laws do not hold true will presentsevere problems for epistemology. All human knowledge of contingent uni-versal propositions presupposes a background of physical laws. Without therebeing a relatively xed set of knowable physical laws, human empiricalknowledge would seem to be signicantly curtailed. In an afterlife wherephysical possibility expands to nearly the compass of logical possibility, asubstantial part of human knowledge would have to flow from (what are inthis world) unknown a priori sources, and not from a posteriori ones.392 Beyond Experience The principal difculty, as I see it, is that persons sometimes have intensely painful desires which may be satised in but one single way.This is particularly awkward when the desire is not for a kind ofmaterial possession or a physical skill or a bodily appearance (a desirewhich the Dispenser of Justice could easily indulge), but for the com-pany, love, or companionship of - not just some person or other, but -some particular person. How could the problem of, let us say, unre-quited love be solved by the Dispenser of Justice in the afterlife? F r o it often happens that one person will for m strong emotional bonds - ofcaring, of longing, of needing - to some particular other person, wherethe latter person loathes and actively avoids the for mer. There seems to be no fully satisfactory, i.e. uncompromised, solu- tion to this problem, although there are a number of apparent solu-tions. W might begin, for example, by arguing that justice does note demand the elimination of every possible pain. Justice, we might tryto argue, demands only eliminating persons ' pains when to do so doesnot infringe on the rights of other persons. Are we then to ignore the pain of the person whose love is unre- quited? Not much of a heaven, we might be inclined to protest, inwhich there is still so much pain. An innocent person whose love isunrequited might be suffering the pains of hell. How come this is per-mitted in heaven? What can be done to alleviate the undeserved suf-fering of this person? The immediate temptation, since we are talking of heaven, where everything short of the logically impossible is possible, is to argue thatthe Dispenser of Justice could simply will away the sufferer 's pain. Ifdesire is causing intense pain to its owner, and if that desire cannot besatised because to do so would conflict with the rights of others, thenit would seem that the next best alter native would be for that desire tobe expunged, i.e. nullied, by an act of the Dispenser of Justice. But the trouble with such solutions, and so many others which would have existence in the afterlife sanitized, sterilized, perfumed,rendered conflict-free, etc., is that they sometimes do violence to thevery concept of personal identity. Consider the case of the parentwhose entire reason for being is directed toward caring for and lovinghis / her daughter. But suppose the child reacts by asserting her autono-my. Above all else she wants to be free of, and distant from, herparent. Suppose, too, that these differences are irreconcilable. Wemight suppose that the parent 's love in this case is overbearing; per-haps it is even irrational. In a world unconstrained by physical laws, the Dispenser of JusticeP rsons 393 e could remove the parent 's pain by eradicating the desire which engendered it. But would this be justice? W can imagine the prospect e of having the painful longing removed being put to the parent beforethe Dispenser of Justice acted. And we can imagine the parent protest-ing: \" T blot out this particular desire would be to destroy me. Whato makes me ME is my love and longing - however much grief it causesme - for my child. If I cannot have the love of my child reciprocatedand you were to rob me of this pain, you will have annihilated me.This living body might remain, but whatever survives such a drasticalter nation will not be ME. \" Some persons do have such desires, desires which are intensely painful and yet which justice - because of the conflicting rights ofothers - cannot satisfy. But justice cannot always then fall back to a' next best ' solution, viz. eliminating the pain by nullifying thosedesires. F r justice, surely, also demands the preservation of personal o identity. And these latter two demands - the elimination of the pain ofinnocent persons and the preservation of personal identity - willsometimes be impossible to satisfy together. There are certain unsatis-able desires, some of them intensely painful, whose eliminationwould be tantamount to extinguishing the person who had them. There is a second sort of difculty for the belief that justice might be realized in an afterlife. Do virtue and do wrongdoing have justdeserts? Is the rehabilitation of the wrongdoer, is his / her contrition, ishis / her restitution of wrongly appropriated property all that justicedemands? Certainly for many cases the answer must be yes. Butsomething deep inside many of us resists this answer for all cases.Some crimes are so heinous as to make rehabilitation and contritionwholly inadequate. Some crimes are of such magnitude as to makeany thought of restitution insulting to the offended. Nothing humanlydoable in this world could be t justice for the crimes of, let us say, aMengele, and he was - sad to say - not the worst. F r some crimes nothing short of punishment of the offender willo satisfy the longing for justice the offended-against demand. But - andhere 's the rub - punishment often cannot be meted out to the guiltywithout causing pain to the innocent. I am not talking of the pain ofpersons opposed to punishment - although their pain may be real anddeep - but of the more immediate pain of the wives, husbands,mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, friends, and lovers of the punished.P rsons do not become guilty themselves and warrant punishment fore loving a wrongdoer. And yet their pain may well be, very likely willbe, intense when he is suffering his punishment.394 Beyond Experience Here, rationality takes a back seat to emotions. While knowledge that the child is in fact guilty and is being punished justly and deser-vedly may quell a parent 's outrage and stifle his objections, thatknowledge may do little to numb his anguish. Indeed, it may evenmake it worse by denying the parent the vent of a righteous fury. W re the Dispenser of Justice to will away the grief and pain of thee innocent person for his / her loved one 's punishment, the grieving per-son would have been rendered less than human. Consider the case of aserial child molester and murderer. A very great deal of our horror,revulsion, and demand for his punishment is grounded in our empathywith the pain caused his victims ' surviving families. That is, part ofour outrage flows from our certain knowledge of the grief familieswill feel at the injury and death of one of their members. And yetwhen we demand punishment of the wrongdoer, his own - innocent -family will suffer because of his pain. What choices are then open tothe Dispenser of Justice? Eschew punishing the guilty? render insensible of the punishment? render their innocentfamilies uncaring? The consequences of each of these alter nativesseem to be forswearing justice, adopting subterfuge, and inducing cal-lousness, respectively. None of these strikes me as compatible withperfect justice. But this is hardly the end of the problem. There is yet a third dif- culty. If there is an afterlife, what age are we each to be in thatafterlife? Few, if any, nonagenarians would want to endure an eternity' housed ' in the body they had at the time of their death. No, justicewould seem to require getting back your body when it was at its ttestand healthiest: a twenty-ve-year-old body for most persons (that is, ifthe Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is to be believed in thesematters). But what of the mentally and physically handicapped? Whatof the legions of children who died in childhood and never had anadult body? What bodies, what age, what capacities are these latterpersons to have in the afterlife? Surely the infant who died in this world at the age of two is not to remain an infant for eternity in the afterlife. Granted there are certainpleasures of childhood, but I think it the rare person who would will-ingly swap those of adulthood for those of childhood. But if the childwho died at the age of two years in this world is not to remain aninfant in the afterlife, what sort of person is he to be in that afterlife?Is he to mature in that afterlife, both bodily and mentally, as he wouldhave done had he not died in this world?P rsons 395 e One possibility would be to accelerate the two-year-olds immedi- ately to adulthood. But this solution poses fresh problems of injustice.It strikes me as unfair to rob anyone of childhood. Having reachedadulthood, I prefer it to childhood; even so, I would not want to havemissed childhood. If children who die in this world are to be given in the afterlife the childhoods they missed, the afterlife is going to have to resemble theplanet Earth far more than it resembles traditional images of heaven.Put bluntly, heaven is no place for a human child to grow up. A placeof plenitude and where physical possibility is - more or less - coex-tensive with logical possibility just does not strike me as the tplayground for a young inquiring mind. On the contrary, it strikes meas a place where one cannot have much fun. T be a proper environ- o ment for a human child, the afterlife ought to be awfully like thisworld, complete with swings, trees, frogs (or similar sorts of exotica),schools, cuts and bruises, successes and failures, joy and heartbreak,etc. At the very least, it has to resemble Earth, not so much in appear-ance, but in physical law. It has to be a place in which much the samesorts of things have to occur as happen typically on Earth, and thatmeans it has - of its very nature - to be a place where there is muchunfairness. So while unfairness need not be a permanent feature ofheaven, it must be of a part of heaven for at least as long as it takes thelast-dead child to reach adulthood. This still leaves the problem of the mentally handicapped. Are they in the afterlife to be made rational and intelligent? After all, it wasunfair that they were not more rational and intelligent in the rstinstance. But how can rationality and intelligence be conferred on aseverely mentally handicapped person without thereby destroying thatperson 's identity? Marked increases in rationality and intelligence arecertain to alter a person 's personality radically: the desires, the ex-pectations, the abilities, the typical reactions, the human relationships,etc. that the original person had are bound to change signicantly. Butthese kinds of changes are just the sorts of ones which we regard asaltering personal identity. A person who speaks fourteen languages,who runs a mile in 3:51 minutes, who discourses on the subtleties ofQuine 's philosophy, and who choreographs ballets to the music ofVilla Lobos cannot in any but the most Quixotic sense be identiedwith an earlier person whose body he may have inherited, but whowas deaf, dumb, halt, and incapable of understanding language. My nagging fear is that the injustice which befalls some of us - par-396 Beyond Experience ticularly those so unfortunate as to be bor n profoundly mentally and 23physically handicapped - cannot be undone or recompensed. The ' not ' operative here is the ' not ' of ' not logically possible ', not ' not humanly possible '. T undo a severe mental handicap is not to give o someone something he lacked, but is to annihilate the one person andto substitute in his place another. P rsonal identity logically cannot be e preserved over a change of this kind and this magnitude. The promiseis often made by clerics that the injustices and suffering of this worldwill be ' put right ' in the afterlife. But the promise is at best a false-hood or at worst a lie. There is no logically possible way to ' put right 'the injustice of a person 's being bor n profoundly mentally handi-capped. In the end, I have a gnawing suspicion that the very existence of an afterlife is a myth. If it is not, then it is hard to see how it could evenbegin to live up to its billing. If there is an afterlife, it can hardly bethe sort of place where justice is nally realized. The trouble is thatjustice logically cannot nally be realized. Not even a perfect Dis-penser of Justice can bestow perfect justice on less than perfectbeings, i.e. on the likes of you and me, our friends and loved ones,those we care about, and those we abominate.

W were e very close. I was taught to read early so that I could read to him, and I readhim the newspapers, the Congressional Record, history. When I was a littleboy, a sob sister for a newspaper came to interview my grandfather. She said,' Senator, there must be so many compensations for your blindness, like asuperb memory, sensitive hearing. Could you tell me what they are? ' And hesaid, ' There are no compensations. ' That phrase has sounded continuously in my head ever since \" (Gore Vidal; reported in [36], 53). 24. Arrigo Boito, libretto for V rdi 's Otello, act I I, scene I I, 1886 eGlossary accidental property A property of a thing, x, is said to be ' acciden- tal ' if x could still be x and lack that specic property. Properties which are not accidental are said to be ' essential '. F r example, the o property of having straight sides is an essential property of a thing 'sbeing a square. But being painted green would be an accidentalproperty of a square. algorithm An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure (recipe) for nd- ing the solution in a nite number of steps to a specied kind ofproblem. F r example, the algorithm for nding whether a natural o number (expressed in base ten) is divisible without remainder bythree is: \" (1) Strike out all occurrences of the digits 0, 3, 6, and 9.(2) Add the remaining digits, if any, together. (3) If the sum isgreater than 9, repeat steps (1), (2), and (3). (4) If the result is nil, 3,6, or 9, then the original number is divisible by 3; if the result isanything else, then the original number is not divisible by 3. \" a posteriori By experience a priori A proposition (see \" proposition \") is said to be knowable a priori if it can be known without experience . Some persons have mistakenly believed that a priori knowledge is knowledge whichis possible prior to any experience, e.g. would be knowledge attainable by a newbor n infant. This is a misconception. When phi-losophers say that a proposition can be known without experience,they mean that no particular experience of the world, save perhapslear ning a language, is necessary to be able to gure out the truth orfalsity of the proposition. V rious propositions have been offered as a examples of this kind of knowledge, e.g. those of mathematics(\" F ur squared is sixteen \"); of logic (\" If P and Q are both true, theno P is true \"); and of (narrow) conceptual analysis (\" If A is older thanB, then B is younger than A \"). Empiricists believe that there are nofactual (see \" contingent \") propositions which are knowable a priori;398 Glossary Rationalists, in contrast, believe that there are at least some. (See also the discussion in footnote 8, p. 101.) begging the question A fallacious manner of arguing in which the very thing that one is attempting to establish is assumed as apremise belief Philosophers use the ter m \" belief \" broadly. Our use includes religious beliefs, but all other beliefs as well: political beliefs, scien-tic beliefs, etc. In short, we use this ter m to encompass anythingbelieved, from beliefs about the origin of the universe to ones asmundane as whether the car needs to be washed. Cartesian Deriving from the philosophy of Ren \u00b4 Descartes e class See \" set \". coextensive 1. Two objects, O and O , are coextensive if they occupy precisely the same region of space.2. Two events, E and E , are coextensive if they occupy the same interval of time.3. Two classes (sets) are said to be coextensive if every member ofone is a member of the other and conversely. Thus, for example, theclass which is the largest elected legislative assembly on Earth in1980 is coextensive with the class which consists of the 1980 mem-bership of the United States Senate and the House of Repre-sentatives. Note that the class which consists of the United StatesSenate together with the House of Representatives is, by denition,the United States Congress. But the for mer class, i.e. the largestelected legislative assembly on Earth, is not - by denition - theCongress; it just happens - as a matter of fact - to comprise thesame membership. An alter native way of saying that two classes arecoextensive is to say that they are extensionally equivalent . conr mation A hypothesis is said to be conr med if a new predic- tion derived from that hypothesis is shown to be true. Conr mationis not, however, verication. T verify a hypothesis is to show it to o be true. Conr mation is a weaker relation than verication. T con- o r m a hypothesis is to offer in support evidence which falls short ofestablishing the truth of that hypothesis. That is, to conr m ahypothesis is to offer evidence which raises the probability of thathypothesis being true, but which does not prove it to be true. F r o example, someone might try six different chords on a piano andnd them all in tune. Such evidence would conr m the hypothesisGlossary 399 that all strings on the piano were in tune, but would not verify that hypothesis. It remains possible that some of the untested strings areout of tune. contingent A proposition P is said to be contingent if neither it (i.e. P) nor its denial (i.e. not- P) is self-contradictory. Contingent propositions thus are ones which, from a logical point of view,could be true and could be false (e.g. that the Titanic struck an iceberg), i.e. ones which could have either truth-value (see p. 28). Whether a proposition is contingent or not has nothing whatever todo with anyone 's knowing its truth-value; it is wholly a matter of whether or not both it and its denial are free of self-contradiction.Non-contingent propositions are those which are either self-con-tradictory themselves (e.g. that someone 's brother is an only child)or whose denials are self-contradictory (e.g. [the necessary truth]that all squares have four sides). Some philosophers explicate thedistinction between contingency and non-contingency by sayingthat a contingent proposition is one which is true in some possibleworld(s) and is false in some (other) possible world(s), while anon-contingent proposition either is true in all possible worlds or isfalse in all possible worlds. \" Contingent \" used in its technical sense, as it is in this book, does not mean, as it often does in ordinary English, \" conditional upon \",as when, for example, one might say, \" Their attending the picnicwill be contingent upon the weather. \" This latter, ordinary, use of\" contingent \" is simply not used at all in this book. counterfactual \" Counterfactual \" means \" contrary-to-(actual)-fact \". One of the most common devices philosophers use to try to dis-cover persons ' dispositions to use a certain ter m, x, is to ask ques- tions of the sort, \" What would you say if such-and-such were(counterfactually) to be so-and-so? W uld you describe it as being o x? \" F r many philosophical purposes, \" counterfactually \" and \" ino another (i.e. non-actual) possible world \" may be used interchan-geably. (See section 6.4, pp. 108ff.) descriptive denition A descriptive denition is one which reports the standard usage of a ter m. It may be contrasted with nor mativeand with stipulative denitions. A nor mative denition is one whichattempts to rene a usage, as we see, for example, in some dic-tionaries war ning readers not to use \" infer \" and \" imply \" interchan-geably. See also \" stipulative denition \".400 Glossary empirical 1. \" Empirical \" is most often used as a modier of \" knowl- edge \". When so used it describes the mode by which that knowl- edge is obtainable. Some authors use the ter m \" empirical \" as equiv-alent to \" a posteriori \", i.e. as equivalent to \" by experience \". In thisbook, however, I adopt the stricter (narrower) meaning prescribedby Immanuel Kant in which \" empirical \" means not \" by experience \"but \" only by experience \" (see [34], 149-56). When I write that something, P, is knowable empirically, I mean that P cannot be known (by human beings) in any way other than by experience.Whatever is humanly knowable, but in a way other than by experi-ence, is knowable a priori. (See denitions of \" a priori \" and \" a pos-teriori \".)2. Occasionally \" empirical \" is also used as a modier of \" concept \".An empirical concept is one whose referent is observable or detec-table through experience. W ight is thus an empirical concept; soul e and substance are often regarded as nonempirical concepts. epistemology One of the principal branches of philosophy, epis- temology is the theory of knowledge. Its subject matter includes therole of sense perception in the acquisition of knowledge, the pos-sibility of attaining objective knowledge, the psychological aspectsof knowledge, and - on some accounts - the sociological aspects ofknowledge. (The adjectival for ms are \" epistemic \" and \" epistemo-logical \".) eschatological P rtaining to the end of the world, life after death, etc.e exobiology The ter m \" exobiology \" was coined (c. 1960) ([21], 355) by the geneticist, Joshua Lederberg ([69]). It refers to the study of(or, for the present time at least, the search for) life beyond theEarth 's atmosphere, in effect on other planets. Whereas the program S E T I is the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life, the scope of exobiology is wider: it is the search for alien life itself, intelligent ornot. formal \" F rmal \" pertains to structure; its contrast is content. F roo example, the two sentences \" Sally sees Richard \" and \" New Y rk is o larger than Boston \", while having different content, share some ofthe same structure, i.e. are formally alike to a degree, in that bothconsist of a relational ter m flanked fore and aft by proper names. Insection 8.8, I write about certain formal properties shared by spatialand temporal relations. F r example, the spatial relation of being o north of is, to a certain degree, formally equivalent to the temporalGlossary 401 relation of being earlier than . Both are so-called ' ordering rela- tions ': locations in space (along a line of longitude) may be ar-ranged in order according to the relation is north of ; similarly, events (subject to certain constraints within special relativity theo-ry) may be ordered according to the relation is earlier than . (In logical ter ms, both these relations bear the formal, or structural,properties of transitivity , There are only two truth-values (see p. 28): true and false. There is nothing ' intermediate ' between truth and falsity. That is,there is no ' third ', or ' middle ' truth-value. (This latter claim hassince ancient times been known as the law of the excluded middle.)Thus no single proposition can be either half-true or half-false.However, a set of two or more propositions may contain some members which are true and others which are false. Although anyset of propositions which contains even a single false proposition is,taken as a whole, false, it is sometimes convenient to designate setswhich contain some false propositions and some true propositionsas being a ' half-truth '. A half-truth is thus a ' mixed ' set of proposi-tions: some of its members are true, but only some; the others arefalse. idealism Idealism is the theory that the only things that exist are minds and their contents, e.g. pains, beliefs, desires, sensations ofsounds, afterimages. Although \" idealistic \" is often used in ordinaryspeech to describe persons who have ' ideals ', i.e. ambitions to bet-ter themselves or the world at large, this is not the sense of \" ideal-ism \" being used in this book. Here, \" idealism \" is the name of ametaphysical thesis which contrasts, in the rst instance, withmaterialism. (See also \" materialism \".) individual (noun) In ordinary speech, \" individual \" usually means a person. But in philosophical terminology, \" individual \" is given awider meaning. As often used by philosophers, \" individual \" meansnot just persons, but any particular thing whatever: individualnoises, cars, violins, pains, memories, molecules, stars, etc. An indi-vidual is, then, anything which is located in space and time.Another ter m which is used virtually interchangeably with \" individ-ual \" is \" particular \". (Note: some philosophers will use \" individual \"in an even broader sense. They use \" individual \" to refer to anythingwhatsoever which may be talked about as the subject of discourse.402 Glossary Thus they will include the number two, the number three, etc. in the class of individuals even though they may be disinclined to believethat such ' entities ' are located in space and time. The mere fact thatone can attribute properties to numbers, e.g. \" The number two iseven \", sufces - on this latter account - to win for numbers thestatus of being individuals.) materialism Materialism is the theory that the only things that exist are material (physical) things: subatomic particles through to humanbodies and their brains, and on through to stars, galaxies, and galac-tic clusters. But beyond these things and their distinctive properties,there are no other sorts of things, e.g. minds or supernatural beings,in the world. This technical sense must be distinguished from themore familiar, ordinary sense in which \" materialism \" is used todescribe the greed of persons who are overly acquisitive of materialpossessions. (See also \" idealism \".) methodology The body of techniques, rules, and procedures adopted for the pursuit of some discipline, e.g. science. Methodologicalassumptions are sometimes adopted, not so much because they arethemselves believed to be true, but because their adoption is be- lieved to offer a protable manner of pursuing truth. F r example, o some psychologists will adopt behaviorism as a methodologicalprinciple, not so much because they believe that all mental acts canin some sense be ' reduced to ' overt behavior, but because theybelieve that studying behavior provides the best - and in someinstances, the only - access scientists have to the mental states ofother persons. modality 1. In philosophy, \" modality \" refers to that family of proper- ties which includes possibility, impossibility, contingency, andnecessity. T specify, then, the modal status of a proposition is to o say something about its possibility, impossibility, contingency, ornecessity. One particularly fashionable way to explicate modal con-cepts in contemporary philosophy is through the idiom of possibleworlds. A proposition is said to be (logically) possible, for example,if it is true in at least one possible world; a proposition is said to be( logically) impossible if it is true in no possible worlds; etc. Modal status is often contrasted with epistemic status , the latter having to do with whether a proposition is knowable or unknowable, knownor unknown. (Modal and epistemic status can link in sixteen differ-ent combinations. See [34], esp. 156-75.)Glossary 403 2. In psychology, \" modality \" refers to any of several different kinds of sensory abilities (or senses), e.g. seeing, hearing, smelling. Sightcomprises one sensory modality (or mode); hearing, another; smell-ing, still another; etc. necessary condition \" x is a necessary condition for y \" means \" if x did not exist ( / did not occur / was false), then y would not exist ( / would not occur / would be false) \". F r example, being more than o twelve years old is a necessary condition for being twenty years old , inasmuch as a thing / person which was not more than twelve years old would not be twenty years old. Pulling a face card from a deck of cards is a necessary condition for pulling a Queen, but it is not asufcient condition: the face card pulled may be a Jack. (See also\" sufcient condition \".) If x is a necessary condition for y, then y - in tur n - is a sufcient condition for x. necessary truth A proposition (see below) is a necessary truth if its denial is self-contradictory. Synonyms for \" necessary truth \" include\" logical truth \" and \" non-contingent truth \". Using the possible-worlds idiom, a necessary truth may be explicated as a propositionwhich is true in all logically possible worlds, i.e. true under anylogically possible circumstances. Necessary truths include suchpropositions as \" 2 + 2 = 4 \" and \" All red things are colored. \" ontology 1. The fundamental categories of what sorts or kinds of things there are in the universe. At one level of analysis, tables andchairs might be considered to be distinct kinds of things; but for thepurposes of ontology, tables and chairs are (usually regarded asbeing) the same sort of ' thing ', namely physical (or spatiotemporal)entities. Other ' fundamental ' sorts of things which have been pro-posed by various philosophers at one time or another have been:sets (or classes), propositions, facts, states of affairs, universals,numbers, causal connections, forces, substances, souls, minds, spiri-tual beings, ethical values, purposes, etc.2. The branch of metaphysics concer ned with the fundamentalcategories of things particular (noun) See \" individual \". particular (adj.) When used as an adjective, \" particular \" typically modies \" proposition \" or \" statement \". A particular proposition isone of the for m \" Some S is P \" or \" There are Ss (which are Ps). \" Another name for \" particular proposition \" is \" existential proposi-404 Glossary tion \". P rticular propositions should not be confused with singular a propositions. P rticular propositions are general propositions: they a refer, not to specic individuals, but to classes of individuals.However, singular propositions, e.g. \" Brian Mulroney is prime min-ister \", do refer to specic individuals. Just to make life compli-cated: singular propositions refer to specic particulars; particularpropositions do not. phenomenology A description of the formal structure of the objects of awareness, i.e. a description of the appearance of things, dis-regarding any account of their origin, explanation, causes, etc.(There is, in addition, a philosophical school called ' Phenomenol-ogy ', founded by Brentano and extended by Husserl. This latter -different - sense of \" phenomenology \" is not invoked in this book.) physical impossibility A situation is physically impossible if its description is inconsistent with physical laws (i.e. with the laws ofNature). F r example, it is thought that it is a physical law ( law of o Nature) that no material object can be accelerated past the speed oflight (300,000 km / sec). If so, then it is physically impossible forthere to be some material object which is accelerated to, let us say,375,000 km / sec. But note that although this latter situation is saidto be physically impossible, its description is not logically self- inconsistent, and hence is not logically impossible. posit (noun) A hypothesis or assumption posit (verb) T put forward a posit, i.e. to assume a hypothesiso predicate (verb) T attribute a quality or relation too proposition Some philosophers use the ter m \" statement \" as a synonym for \" proposition \". Propositions are the sorts of thingswhich are true or false; they are the sorts of things which may bebelieved, disbelieved, known, doubted, etc. In English, propositionsoften are expressed by so-called ' that-phrases ', e.g. \" She knew that the train would be late \" and \" He theorized that the solution con- tained copper sul fate \". (F r a discussion of several different theo-o ries about the metaphysical nature of propositions, see [34], 65-127,esp. 65-86.) question-begging See \" begging the question \". reciprocal (math.) The reciprocal of a number is its multiplicative in- verse, i.e. the number which when multiplied by the original num-Glossary 405 ber yields 1 as the product. Thus, the reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/ 3, and of -2 is -1/ 2. retrodiction Retrodicting is the analog of forecasting an event, but directed oppositely in time, i.e. to the past rather than the future.Just as one might forecast, from a knowledge of physical lawsalong with specic data about the current position and speed of acomet, where it will be ten years from now, one might retrodictwhere it was ten years ago. semantics Semantics is the branch of the theory of signs dealing with meaning, e.g. with how descriptive ter ms (or better, their users) refer to items and features in the world. set A set is any class or collection of things. The set (class) may be ' natural ', e.g. the set of mammals, or it may be completely arbi-trary, e.g. the set consisting of Napoleon, the number two, and V n- a couver Island. Sets, on most accounts, are regarded as abstract enti-ties and are not to be identied with their members. E.g. the set which consists of my daughter 's piano is not itself a piano (nor is it,for that matter, even a physical [material] object). Sets are standard-ly denoted by braces, e.g. \" {Napoleon, 2, V ncouver Island} \". a A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every member of A is also a member of B. A set A is said to be a proper subset of a set B if A is a subset of B, but not conversely. E.g. the set of women is a proper subset of the set of human beings. Although the ter ms \" sub-set \" and \" proper subset \" are not, strictly speaking, equivalent, manyauthors write the for mer for the latter. A set A is said to be a superset of a set B if every member of B is also a member of A. A set A is said to be a proper superset of a set B if A is a superset of B, but not conversely. E.g. the set of human beings is a proper superset of the set of women. Again, as with\" proper subset \", many authors omit \" proper \" when writing ofproper supersets. An ordered set (denoted by angle brackets) is one in which both its membership and the order of the members determine the set. The (non-ordered) set A, {2, 5, 8}, is identical to the set B, {5, 8, 2}: A and B have the same membership. But this set also gives rise to six nonidentical ordered sets: 2, 5, 8, 2, 8, 5, 5, 2, 8, 5, 8, 2, 8, 2, 5, and 8, 5, 2.406 Glossary An ordered pair is an ordered set having two members. stipulative denition A stipulative denition is one which lays down a specic, usually specialized and technical, usage for a ter m.Examples may be found in the denition of \" contingent \" above and\" world \" below. See also \" descriptive denition \". sufcient condition \" x is a sufcient condition for y \" means \" if x exists ( / occurs / is true), then y exists ( / occurs / is true) \". F r ex- o ample, being twenty years old is a sufcient condition for being more than twelve years old , inasmuch as any thing / person which is twenty years old is thereby guaranteed to be a thing which is more than twelve years old. Pulling a Queen from a deck of playing cardsis a sufcient condition for pulling a face card, but it is not a neces-sary condition: one could pull a face card which was not a Queen,i.e. a King or a Jack. (See also \" necessary condition \".) If x is a sufcient condition for y, then y - in tur n - is a necessary condition for x. sui generis In a class by itself topology Geometry has two branches: metrical geometry and topol- ogy. Metrical geometry concer ns measurement and size - such mat-ters as, for example, proportionality; relative sizes of angles;lengths of peripheries; angles for med by the intersection ofdiagonals; projections of three-dimensional objects onto two-dimensional surfaces; and perspective. T pology, in contrast, is o concer ned with those aspects of geometry which are independent ofthe sizes of the gures, indeed which would still obtain even if thegure were to be ' stretched ' or ' distorted ' (short of ' tearing ' it) -such matters as, for example, the existence of paths connecting twoor more regions; the equivalence of knots; and the number of colorsrequired (in principle) to color any arbitrary map so that no twoadjacent regions have the same color. From a metrical point ofview, a sphere, an oval, and an ellipse are all different gures; froma topological point of view, they are identical. Similarly, from atopological point of view, these three gures share the sametopological dimensions: they are two-dimensional whatever theirsizes or however they are stretched. underdetermined A hypothesis or theory is said to be underdeter- mined by the evidence which supports it if that evidence does notlogically guarantee the truth of that hypothesis or theory. If someGlossary 407 evidence underdetermines a hypothesis, then that same evidence also underdetermines (some) competing theories. Thus, for ex-ample, using the (necessarily inconclusive) evidence produced bythe W rren Commission, many writers have proposed several dif-a ferent theories of John F. Kennedy 's assassination: e.g. that Oswaldacted alone, that Oswald was not the assassin, that there was asecond shooter, that organized crime planned the operation, and thatforeign nationals planned the operation. universal (adj.) The adjectival for m of \" universal \" means \" for all of the universe, i.e. throughout all of space and time. \" \" Universal \" isnot limited just to the planet Earth. (See \" world \".) \" Universal \" doesnot mean \" necessary \". Something can be universally true withoutbeing necessarily true, e.g. that the speed of light is greater than290,000 km / sec. universal (noun) According to the theory of Realism, the properties of particulars (see above) are posited to be (abstract) entities ' sub-sisting ' outside of space and time. Such entities are usually called\" universals \". In this theory, the class of universals includes green-ness, triangularity, solubility, hardness, etc. As well, especiallysince the early twentieth century, it has become usual for Realism toinclude among universals the relations obtaining between par- ticulars, e.g. being to the left of or being older than . Needless to say, the ontological status of universals, i.e. the ' nature ' of their exist-ence, has been a subject of intense controversy in metaphysics sincePlato rst introduced the topic. F r more on universals, see chapter o 9, esp. sect. 9.3. world Throughout this book, when I use the ter m \" world \", I mean the entire universe, both what is known of it and what is unknown; Ialso include all of the world 's history, its present, and its future inthis all-encompassing ter m.

Chapter Three - Theories: What they are and what they are notConjectures and Refutations , by Karl P pper. Basic Books, New Y rk, 1962. oo An important work, by a major philosopher. The book becomes progres- sively more difcult. Newcomers to philosophy will want to read selec-tively in this volume. Science and Subjectivity , by Israel Scheffler.

Highly controversial attack, by a historian, on the traditional view that science is objective. Against Method , by P ul Feyerabend.

Burtt. o Routledge & Kegan P ul, London, 1932. a \" How curious, after all, is the way in which we moder ns think about our world! And it is all so novel, too. The cosmology underlying our mentalprocesses is but three centuries old - a mere infant in the history ofFurther Reading 411 thought - and yet we cling to it with the same embarrassed zeal with which a young father fondles his new-bor n baby. \" (chapter 1) Dilemmas , by Gilbert Ryle. Cambridge University Press, London, 1954. Several case studies of clashes between competing philosophical theories. The Strife of Systems: An Essay on the Grounds and Implications of Philo- sophical Diversity , by Nicholas Rescher. University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 1985. Rescher looks at the problem of the superabundance of philosophical theo- ries through the opposite side of the lens used in this book in chapter 4.Where I had argued that factual data underdetermine our philosophical theories, Rescher argues that our philosophical theories overdetermine their empirical base, in particular that our philosophical theories originatein self-inconsistent sets of beliefs (what Rescher calls \" apories \" or\" aporetic clusters \"). These two approaches are complementary. Chapter Five - Underdeterminism ( I I )Plurality of W rlds: The Origins of the Extraterrestrial Life Debate from o Democritus to Kant , by Steven J. Dick.

Between this book and the immediately preceding one the entire history of the debate up to the present century is covered. Extraterrestrials: Science and Alien Intelligence , ed. Edward Regis, Jr. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1985. Appearances to the contrary (see preceding two items), Cambridge Uni- versity Press does not have exclusive rights to this topic.

The Search for Life in the Universe , by Donald Goldsmith and T bias Owen. o Benjamin / Cummings, Menlo P rk, Calif., 1980. a A good introduction to moder n astronomy and exobiology. Probably easier reading than the three foregoing volumes.412 Further Reading Chapters Six and Seven - Putting concepts under stress , ( I ) and ( I I ) Thought Probes (2nd ed.), ed. Fred D. Miller, Jr, and Nicholas D. Smith. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N J, 1989. An introduction to philosophy through the vehicle of science ction.
