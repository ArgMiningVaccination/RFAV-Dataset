The healer's name was Kiir -Aur and he was the grandson of Bba- uma- ibni, the patronymic ancestor of a family of exorcists. We know nothing about Kiir -Aur 's birth and death, except that he lived around the middle of the 7th century BCE in the ancient city of Assur, located some 100 kilometres south of Nineveh, present -day Mosul. Here he resided in the family home, the so- called \"N4 house\" , and practiced the family trade, namely the exorcist's craft. Little is known about his personal life, but due to an abundance of textual sources relating to his profession it is possible to reconstruct and evaluate aspects of his education, career and practice as an exorcist (Akkadian ipu/ mamau). By the 7th century BCE, Assur was the religious centre of the Neo -Assyrian (NA) Empire whereas Nineveh was the political and intellectual capital. Although Assur had earlier been the political capital as well, it retained a spe - cial position, as it was still home to the temple of the national deity Aur and the burial site of the NA kings. It was within this old city that Kiir -Aur and his family practiced their trade as exorcists for private individuals and pos - sibly also for official institutions. Here, the Bba- uma-ibni family assembled a large and private text collection pertaining to their profession as ipus, which provides information about their education, practice, and professional inter - ests. In particular, the texts from this collection provide information regarding Kiir -Aur 's career. This study focuses on how the Mesopotamian healer Kiir -Aur was edu- cated, how he practiced his craft, and how he produced and organized his knowledge, as revealed by his texts. Although some information is now lost, and although the N4 collection spans several generations and does not only contain texts that exclusively concern Kiir -Aur 's training and practice, the texts assigned to him can be allocated to specific phases of his career. They therefore provide information about his education and practice that can be used to discuss his production and use of scholarly texts. Through this mode of investigation, this study provides a rounded analysis of all aspects of an ancient healer's profession, and in turn assesses the socio -cultural aspects of healing in combination with analysing the magico -medical content. The monograph will thus improve our understanding of the functional aspects of 2 Chapter 1 texts in their specialist environment. The microhistorical description of Kiir - Aur 's education and career offered here is the first analysis with this level of detail of a single Mesopotamian healer's training and practice. Furthermore, to my knowledge, this work situates Kiir -Aur as the earliest healer in world history for whom we have such details pertaining to his training and practice, which originates from his own time. 1.1 Colophons Before examining the Mesopotamian magico -medical sources, practices and beliefs, as well as the problems related to studying Mesopotamian scholar - ship, it is necessary to understand how Kiir -Aur is identified as a copyist and owner of the source material. Kiir -Aur 's cuneiform tablets can be identified through a subscript at the end of the texts called a colophon.1 Colophons con- sisted of more or less formulaic elements describing from what manuscript the text was copied,2 who copied, checked or owned the tablet, and what titles these individuals held at the time.3 It is assumed that the copyists themselves wrote them. Colophons from private text collections tend to be less formulaic than their official counterparts, for example, from the library of Assurbanipal, even though they do in some cases employ somewhat formulaic expressions.4 As Kiir -Aur is the subject of this study, the elements of his colophons are inves - tigated throughout this work. The colophons enable us to examine the knowl- edge that was part of Kiir -Aur 's education and career and are therefore the basis for this work. For the purpose of this study, I use the terms \"education\" , \"training\" , and \"career\". The first two terms are used interchangeably to refer to Kiir -Aur 's written and practical schooling. The term \"career\" is used to designate progression in Kiir -Aur 's titles. 1.2 Mesopotamian Medicine Any history of ancient medicine must be written on the basis of surviving manuscripts. Ancient Mesopotamia has left us a large corpus of medical and 1 For colophons in general, see Hunger 1968 and Leichty 1964. 2 Colophons can also provide a fictional history of a text, see Hee\u00dfel 2011: 171-76. 3 For the elements 15; Leichty 1964: 147.3 Introduction magical literature, mostly dating to the first millennium BCE (Peders\u00e9n 1998). In general, studies in Mesopotamian medicine have increased since the early publications by K\u00fcchler (1904), Thompson (1923), Labat (1951), and K\u00f6cher (1955),5 and the previous decades have seen a growth in publications on Mesopotamian medicine, healing practices, and professions.6 Although many texts related to Mesopotamian healing have been passed down to us, these manuscripts are snapshots of specific times and particular places (Nutton 2004: 12). Therefore, tendencies to write overarching histories of medicine on the basis of preserved manuscripts must be nuanced with localized studies such as the present one. Furthermore, considerable information is lost today. Manuscripts have perished, oral traditions disappeared, and some knowl- edge was never committed to writing. Furthermore, specialist knowledge was not necessarily widely available, political upheaval could result in the disap - pearance of entire libraries, and the written medium and primary vernacular changed in the first millennium BCE (see Robson 2011a; Nutton 2004: 5-7). It is therefore necessary to consider when and where individual sources were copied, as well as what purpose the knowledge may have served to the copyist. Another problem relates to the temporal distance. Over two and a half mil- lennia separates the knowledge preserved in the surviving texts from the present day. In Assyriology, Landsberger's understanding of the \"Eigenbegrifflichkeit\" of Mesopotamian cultures, namely that Mesopotamian cultures cannot be adequately described by western terminology and definitions based on the Greek understanding of our world, is still justifiably discussed as a sound approach for examining the ancient texts.7 In order to bridge the gap between the medicine of the modern and ancient world, this study draws on the works of Unschuld (2009: 2-6; ibid. 1980: 13-16), who saw illness as a subjective assessment of poor health influenced by a socio -political context. Yet, a soci- ety can operate with multiple explanatory models, of which some may have an objective medical factor defined by the respective culture. In some areas of medical anthropology, the term \"disease\" implies a biological understanding of the cause of illness and carries connotations of modern Western medicine.8 However, Eisenberg (1977: 13) stressed \"the discrepancy between disease as it is conceptualized by the physician and illness as it is experienced by the patient\" , and such a division of \"disease\" and \"illness\" may exist regardless of the culture in question (see also Kleinman 1980: 72-80). This view on the term \"disease\" and Andersen 2000; Stol 1993. See the bibliography in Verderame 2012. 7 Landsberger 1926 and 1976; see Kottak 2010: 63; see also Avalos 1995: 27. 4 Chapter 1 is not completely anachronistic in regard to ancient Mesopotamia, seeing as cuneiform medical texts can contain traits of professional conceptualisations, which designate states of poor health. Another term useful for describing poor health is \"sickness\" , describing \"the process through which worrisome behav - ioural and biological signs, particularly ones originating in disease, are given socially recognizable meanings, i.e. they are made into symptoms and socially significant outcomes\" (Young 1982: 270). Furthermore, terms such as \"disor - der\" (e.g., Kleinman 1998: 389, 393) and possibly \"syndrome\" (e.g., Arb\u00f8ll 2018a: 278-279) may be applied carefully to some aspects of ancient Mesopotamian medicine. Nonetheless, the words \"illness\" or \"malady\" are preferred through- out the present study, although I acknowledge that other terms concerning poor health can be applied to ancient Mesopotamian medicine. 1.2.1 Magico-medical Healing The Mesopotamians did not distinguish between what we today label as \"magic\" and \"medicine\" , instead believing that illnesses were caused by super - natural forces, such as gods or demons.9 Once a patient was seized by an illness, healing could be achieved through identifying the ailment and the agent caus - ing the malady and subsequently applying therapeutic or ritual treatments to cure the illness and its symptoms, as well as ritual actions to appease the god in question.10 Some terms for ancient illnesses could refer to both the malady and the demon believed to be responsible for the affliction.11 Mesopotamian healing therefore consisted of both magical and medical treatments, and some texts that researchers label \"medical\" contain a mix of diagnoses, symp - tom descriptions, prescriptions, incantations, and prayers, as well as religious 9 The body could perhaps malfunction on its own, see Scurlock 2014: 7. On the question of \"natural\" illnesses, see Collins 1999. 10 Koch unpublished; 1974: 1-95. Note that the symptoms specified in such texts as appearing on the left/right side of the patient may have been described from the perspective of the healer, as suggested by Scurlock and Andersen (2005: xxii- xxiii). However, this suggestion remains a hypothesis. 11 B\u00f6ck 2014a: 179. Few ancient illnesses can with certainty be identified as a modern dis - ease, and applying retrospective diagnoses to ancient Mesopotamian medicine is gener - ally problematic (see Arb\u00f8ll 2018a: 261). Caution is therefore advised when drawing on studies of Mesopotamian medicine primarily employing retrospective diagnoses.5 Introduction rituals.12 Among the reasons for falling ill were sins committed in the past or witchcraft performed against the patient.13 Illness, however, was not the only type of divine punishment and other examples include economic ruin or social ostracism.14 All of these problems could be diagnosed and healed by the ipu.15 Three generalized subcategories of texts are often recognized within the magico -medical corpus, namely diagnostic, therapeutic, and pharmaceuti- cal texts (e.g., CMAwR 1: 8-9). There are no theoretical works on healing from ancient Mesopotamia (Geller 2010: 11; see Section 3.2). Diagnostic texts usu- ally contain a symptom description, formulated as a conditional \"if\"- clause (umma- clause), and an illness diagnosis or information on the cause of the illness and occasionally a prognosis.16 The therapeutic texts typically contain prescriptions with lists of ingredients for, e.g., potions, poultices, enemas, or amulets, and occasionally ritual instructions as well as incantations. Some pre - scriptions open with a symptom description or a diagnosis formulated as a umma-clause and others end with the name of the symptom or illness against which the prescription is considered useful (see, e.g., Johnson 2015: 308; Wee 2012: 198-200). The pharmaceutical texts provide information about individ- ual plants or other ingredients against certain symptoms or illnesses, how they are administered, their appearance, or alternative names.17 It is often unknown how much of the written material related to the ipu was actually put to use.18 Although the above grouping of magico -medical texts places manuscripts with magical and medical content together, it is clear that these could serve specific purposes as approaches to achieve healing.19 12 See references in Ch. 1 note 10. A prime example combining both approaches remains the \"rubbing\" muuu der Toorn 1985. A proper study of what it meant to be ill (maru) is still a desideratum; for now, see Stol 2009b. 14 This is described alongside various other Schwemer 2007a: 132, 147, 168, 170, 178, 181-82, 252, 279. 15 The ipu is occasionally advised not to provide a prognosis of the patient's illness in Sa-gig (Scurlock 2014: 188, 208). In the literary text Ludlul bl nmeqi, the exorcist cannot diagnose the patient's illness, and, thus, he cannot bring about its cure (Lambert 1996: 38-39, 44-45; Annus a discussion of the astrological-astronomical literature used in practice, see Veldhuis 2010. 19 Geller (2016: 30) saw these approaches as complementary, in which medicine could \"alle - viate the symptoms and distress of disease\" , whereas \"magic was required to elucidate 6 Chapter 1 The term \"healing\" is used here to describe the ancient magico -medical approaches for diagnosing and treating illness as well as ensuring social, physical, or mental wellbeing.20 This provides us with a holistic term that can account for the incongruous, but practical, division of healing into \"magical\" and \"medical\" practices, as long as we disregard any loaded meaning of the term.21 Nonetheless, the analytical terms \"medicine\" and \"magic\" are unavoid- able when analysing Mesopotamian healing practices,22 although they have several connotations. Medicine implies rationality and an empirically based Western medical science (Hee\u00dfel 2009: 13-14; Scurlock 1999: 69), whereas the term \"magic\" is a polemic concept with connotations of irrational and super - stitious ritual practices.23 However, there is no equivalent to the term \"magic\" native to Mesopotamia. In the early days of studying Mesopotamian medicine, this dichotomous division of the healing arts was transferred diachronically onto two main healing disciplines: the craft of the \"physician\" (as\u00fb) and the \"exorcist\" (ipu, Ritter 1965; see Section 1.2.3). Today, it is clear that medicine and magic in the first millennium cannot be assigned to either profession exclusively (see recently May 2018). Yet, magico -medical material is still occasionally assigned to these disciplines according to various principles.24 However, such divisions are rarely reflected in the context of the manuscripts investigated.25 Medical and magical approaches to healing in ancient Mesopotamia are therefore still discussed as separate entities, although the abandonment of such a distinc- tion has been recommended (Robson 2008: 476-477). Though the form and content of these approaches may have differed, they were clearly intertwined the nature and cause of illness\" , i.e., it functioned as theory (see also Geller 2007b; Geller 1999). However, the view on magic's role in healing differs between researchers (see, e.g., B\u00f6ck 2014a: 185-186). 20 A concise definition can be also Koch unpublished. 21 See discussion with references in Koch unpublished. 22 Geller discussions of Mesopotamian magic, high-prose incantations have been suggested to belong to the lore of the ipu, while crude spells belong to the lore of the as\u00fb (van Binsbergen and Wiggermann 1999: 29-30; cf. B\u00f6ck 2014a: Johnson (2018) recently suggested a difference in disease aetiologies between the two disciplines. 25 Although the AMC may have been linked to the craft of the as\u00fb (see Steinert 2018c: 178ff.), it included many magical elements (see Section 9.3.2). Furthermore, May (2018: 71) has suggested that the copyist of the AMC was related to Kiir -Aur .7 Introduction approaches for healing in Kiir -Aur 's texts. Thus, at his time we may see them as part of a healing system with a fusion of views (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 180). As a result of the inherent biases, some researchers consider the term \"magic\" best abandoned (e.g., Smith 2004: 218), while others have argued for the valid- ity of \"magic\" as a scientific concept,26 also within Assyriology (e.g., Schwemer 2011: 419-420). In relation to Mesopotamia, magical acts are part of rituals, which in turn are cultural practices often considered to be part of the reli- gious sphere.27 Although magic is often considered to be something predating or operating between religion and science, resembling as well as contrasting elements of both (Smith 2004: 215-18; see S\u00f8rensen 2013: 242), magic must be considered as being linked to ritual and thereby to religion in Mesopotamia (Farber 1995: 1895-96). However, medicine in Mesopotamia must also be con- sidered interrelated with both religion and magic (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 176). Magic and medicine were intermingled in NA healing. They are useful terms for discussing Kiir -Aur 's manuscripts, although they should not be used to force unwarranted meanings of efficacy or rationality onto the texts. Both types of treatments were clearly considered legitimate approaches to healing by the ancient practitioners. This monograph therefore draws on the terms \"magic\" , \"medicine\" and \"ritual\" , while always being conscious of their inher - ent connotations. Throughout this work, the term \"ritual\" is mainly used as an analytical category to distinguish between different texts, thereby analytically identifying their content based on primarily \"magical\" components.28 1.2.2 The ipu-/mamau-exorcist The ipu, also transcribed as mamau, was one of five main scholarly profes - sions throughout the NA period primarily concerned with magico -medical healing and diagnosing causes of problems for clients, and he could perform rituals for the city, the cults, and the court.30 Among his tools were numerous ritu- als, medical remedies, prayers, and incantations (Schwemer 2011: 423-26). His duties overlapped with the as\u00fb and br\u00fb in terms of medical treatments and 26 See, e.g., S\u00f8rensen 2013; S\u00f8rensen 2007; cf. Smith 2004: 218. 27 See Bell 1997: 20-21, 80, 164, 267. For a definition of religion, see Lincoln 2003: 5-8; Boyer 2002. 28 See Section 1.2.3. For the term \"magic\" used in practice.31 In accordance with his duties, the ipu is ordinarily translated as, e.g., \"exorcist, conjurer\" or \"Beschw\u00f6rungspriester\".32 Although such translations are inadequate and often incorrect in describing his competences and duties, this study adopts the translation \"exorcist\" for the sake of convenience. The exorcist is typically referred to by the Sumerogram MA.MA in first millennium BCE sources. Yet, it is often uncertain whether MA.MA should be transcribed as ipu or mamau.33 Various texts equate the Sumerogram l\u00faMA.MA with ipu or mamau,34 but it is largely unclear if these read- ings differed or could be used interchangeably.35 Throughout this study, the transcriptions ipu and mamau are used interchangeably because the sec- ondary literature uses both. 1.2.3 Genres of Texts The ancient Mesopotamians did not group their texts according to modern taxonomies of genres. As a result, modern genres are often applied anachro - nistically to group the magico -medical texts and rituals studied here.36 Such an approach runs the risk of decontextualizing the formal labels used within the ancient texts to categorize the content, such as incantations or prayers introduced by \u00c9N (Lambert 2008), ritual instructions introduced by D\u00d9 .D\u00d9 . BI (Maul 2009), remedies as well as some ritual procedures labelled as bulu (Steinert 2018c: 179 note 112), or particular types of texts such as namburbi- rituals .37 Earlier studies divided magico -medical texts into dichotomous groups of knowledge in which the ipu was interpreted as practicing magic to cure \"supernatural\" causes of illness and the as\u00fb practiced \"rational\" medi- cine to 1965; Herrero 1984: 22-24, 38). This dichotomy was continuously discussed38 and Scurlock (1999: 78-79) suggested the as\u00fb and ipu could have functioned respectively as pharmacist and physi- cian. Scurlock's suggestion has been criticized in various recent studies,39 and 31 Koch 2015: 20-21; 52; Sallaberger and Vulliet 2005. See Koch unpublished. 33 For possible etymologies, see Geller 2010: 43-44; Jean -medical scholarly knowledge 9 Introduction during Kiir -Aur 's time these professions must have tioned complementary.40 In Assur at Kiir -Aur 's time the craft of the ipu was a healing art drawing on a multitude of magical and medical approaches, including those of the as\u00fb, for averting disaster, removing ill omens as well as sickness, and preserving health (Maul 2019: 26 note 3). Grouping texts according to modern principles is never straightforward. Nevertheless, I assign Kiir -Aur 's manuscripts to groups of , \"ritual\" , or \"other\" content: medical texts consist of diagnoses, symptom descriptions, prescriptions, ritual instructions and incantations intended to soothe an affliction of the body or the mind; the ritual texts contain incanta- tions, prayers, and ritual instructions for appeasing causes of illness, removing negative omens, and other purposes; and the \"other\" group comprises texts that do not fit into either of these categories. The terms are solely intended to divide Kiir -Aur 's texts roughly according to content for the reader's con- venience. The categories are admittedly problematic, seeing as texts labelled as \"medical\" can also include incantations and ritual instructions, and texts labelled as \"ritual\" could in some cases be used to appease the divine cause of an illness or remove omens leading to sickness. Thus, texts in both catego - ries would have been part of a shared framework of healing, although they are grouped differently. 1.3 Authorship A number of problems associated with the study of Mesopotamian schol- arly knowledge concern the lack of known authorship and the anonymity of cuneiform literature. Furthermore, the textual traditions of scholarly knowl- edge have in recent decades been shown to be more diverse and individually founded than previously imagined. The question is, of course, whether Kiir - Aur was really the author or merely the copyist of the texts that bear his colophons. We know that Mesopotamian literature was by and large anony - mous (Lambert 1957: 1). Authors can rarely be identified (cf. Foster 1996: 20 and note 2), and there are few text -internal references to composers41 or to a spe - (George 2003: 28-33; Lambert 1962: 66-67, Catalogues of texts in 40 A N4 text (BAM 199 obv. 10) describes the production of a medical \"ointment\" that is later classified as (rev. 14): \"a [sec]ret the mamau\". See 1 and authors show that Mesopotamian scholars of the NA period were con- cerned with tracing certain texts or text series back to gods, sages and legend- ary scholars (Lambert 1962), although this information must be considered unrealistic (Foster 1991: 18, 31). Cuneiform scholarship depended on textual transmission through education (Robson 2011a: 562), and evidence of changes occurs regularly as a result (Worthington 2012: 5-7, 16-28). It is possible that oral traditions also played a substantial role in the transmission of knowl- edge.42 A single author of scholarly texts therefore rarely existed and many \"authors\" were often involved in forming a certain composition (Foster 1991: 17-19 and note 7). Several individuals attributed with \"authorship\" were prob - ably authors, editors, redactors, or something in between.43 Throughout this work, the words \"written\" and \"copied\" are used inter - changeably to describe Kiir -Aur and other scholars' act of copying and writing a text from, e.g., another manuscript, memory, or dictation onto the cuneiform tablet investigated. Therefore, this monograph explicitly notes whenever questions of authorship, redaction, or creativity are addressed. 1.4 Proof and Possibility The present study presupposes the existence of a correlation between content and purpose at the point when texts were copied.44 To clarify, I do not pro - pose a direct correlation between writing a text and acquiring medical exper - tise in the relevant area or applying the text directly in practice. The function of a text could vary. As I argue throughout this study, Kiir -Aur 's texts may generally have been related to practicing the knowledge found therein, as part of a training curriculum he needed to learn regardless of applicability, to improve his understanding of what was described in the text, or a combina- tion of these areas. The purpose has to be evaluated through careful analyses of individual manuscripts and their colophons. Admittedly, only texts with so- called \"purpose statements\" (Section 7.4) can be directly related to practice. Still, the Bba- uma-ibni family were ipus, who must have been engaged in healing activities. Therefore, it is justifiable to presuppose that texts copied 42 See Worthington Section 7.4; cf. Couto -Ferreira 2018: 163. Although the purposes of texts may be elusive, they are important for reconstructing the context and use of ancient knowledge (see Rochberg 2016: 32).11 Introduction during their training must have served educational purposes with a practical dimension (see Maul 2010a: 216). Each text likely provided concrete knowl- edge, which could be considered useful in some form for their practice. A microhistoric approach is employed for investigating Kiir -Aur 's texts (Section 2.1). In microhistory, gaps in the evidence are welcomed as part of the account, by accepting the limitations while exploring the inherent implica- tions (Ginzburg 2012: 208-209). Some microhistorians therefore allow the con- ditional and the speculative in order to go beyond the information obtained from a given source (Tivellato 2015: 128). By researching sources from similar or contemporary geographical, social and cultural domains to illuminate the subject's world, it is therefore possible to carefully combine \"proof\" with \"pos - sibility\" (Ginzburg 2012: 57; As outlined in Section 2.3.1, the N4 text collection consists of limited and incomplete textual evidence. Furthermore, the magico -medical corpus of Mesopotamian healing generally comprises prescriptions, diagnoses, rituals and recitations, which are mainly anonymously authored, stylistically locked in rhetoric, and seemingly detached from theory and practice (Sections 1.2.3 and 1.3). Due to the nature of the material, my approach combines \"proofs\" , i.e., information provided by a source alone, with \"possibility\" , i.e., rigorously researched hypotheses and carefully argued speculations, in order to outline the otherwise inaccessible contours of an ancient healer's training and prac- tice. Such a method is sure to raise objections in Assyriology, although I hold a distinct line between argumentation and meticulously reasoned hypotheses on the one hand, and wild and free guesswork on the other. Therefore, what some readers may mistake for straightforward conclusions or equivocations are in fact carefully formulated hypotheses and suggestions. As a result of this approach and its caveats, the impact that the identified individual magico - medical focuses might have had on Kiir -Aur 's training and practice is likely to be subject to interpretation in future studies, regardless of how probable specific assessments may be. 1.5 Scope and Structure This study comprises ten chapters, which are structured around the various phases of Kiir -Aur 's career and the groups of texts assigned to each phase. Where there are relatively few texts assigned to a phase, several phases have been grouped together in a single chapter. Chapter 2 provides the framework for the study by defining the microhis - torical approach and its applicability here. It furthermore offers an overview of 12 Chapter 1 the previous research on and a description of Kiir -Aur and the Bba- uma- ibni family. This chapter sets the stage for the analysis of Kiir -Aur 's texts within the N4 collection. Chapter 3 focuses on Kiir -Aur 's earliest attested career phase, the amall\u00fb eru-phase. Kiir -Aur copied a number of medical texts during this period, and the chapter discusses their diagnoses in relation to Kiir -Aur 's medical proficiency. It is proposed here that Kiir -Aur 's anatomical and physiologi- cal understanding, as well as his diagnostic capabilities, were trained during this phase. In chapter 4, I discuss physiological aspects of Kiir -Aur 's training as amall\u00fb eru by contextualizing the snakebites, scorpion stings, and horse illnesses treated in RA 15 pl. 76. I explore the role of venom in Kiir -Aur 's anatomical understanding by proposing a new framework for the cultural and scholarly understanding of venom in relation to symptoms and illnesses, according to which venom, bile, and saliva may have provided an interspe - cies conceptual framework for understanding human physiology. Here, I also address the role of veterinarian knowledge in Kiir -Aur 's , for which only a few texts are attested, are studied in chapter 5. The texts from these phases indicate that Kiir -Aur copied rituals connected to private religion and a text to calm a child. On the basis of the child treatment, the chapter contextualizes the text by discussing paediatricians in Mesopotamia and provides a hypothesis suggesting that Kiir -Aur may have worked with greater autonomy on animals first and children secondarily, before moving on to adults later. Chapter 6 scrutinizes the texts from Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase and I argue that he began conducting house calls and organizing healing rituals during this phase. Furthermore, contemporary evidence indicates that he pro - tected households prophylactically from illness and epidemics and that such rituals may have functioned as quarantine measures. Additionally, a number of namburbi-rituals from this and Kiir -Aur 's later mama bt Aur-phase may relate to conducting house calls and supervising rituals. Furthermore, a single lexical text possibly attests to Kiir -Aur 's scholarly training during this phase. Chapter 7 studies a number of texts with colophons that do not con- tain titles or are broken, which are relevant for an understanding of Kiir - Aur 's career. On the basis of text -internal features, this chapter argues that a number of texts should be assigned to the mamau- and mama bt Aur-phases of Kiir -Aur 's career. In particular, the addition of so -called \"purpose statements\" , i.e., statements designating the tablet as produced for 13 Introduction preparing a ritual, are argued to stem from his mamau-phase and later. The chapter also discusses two texts possibly consisting of commentaries. Chapter 8 investigates the texts from Kiir -Aur 's final career phase, the mama bt Aur-phase. The content of three large groups of medical, ritual, and other texts, of which the last group was associated with the Aur temple, are investigated. In connection with the medical texts, the chapter offers a case study of the prescriptions labelled as \"tested\". This chapter also discusses a text labelled as a panacea, i.e., a universal prescription, as well as Kiir -Aur 's use of medical incantations. Chapter 9 provides a general outlook on Kiir -Aur 's overall knowledge production. It is argued that Kiir -Aur may have focused on certain areas of medicine during his career. This chapter also addresses the question of numbered extract texts and their interpretation, as well as the catch-lines and their relationship to the therapeutic series Ugu and the Assur Medical Compendium. I further examine the relationship between Kiir -Aur 's career and the Exorcist's Manual, which is considered to be a list comprising major works of the ipu's knowledge base. These preliminary results are contextual- ized within the larger framework of local knowledge in Assur and Nineveh. A summary and synthesis of the most important results is presented in chapter 10.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 003 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Chapter 2 Framework and Background On the 31st of August 658 BCE Kisir -Aur quickly extracted select parts of a ritual to remove a ghost and copied them onto a manuscript.1 On this day, he may have been sitting in the paved courtyard outside the scholarly library of his family home in the middle of Assur (Section 2.3). Let us imagine him sitting on the ground in the sunny yard, holding a moist clay tablet in one hand and a stylus in the other, ready to imprint the clay with cuneiform signs reproducing the original manuscript in front of him containing a complex ritual text.2 As Kisir -Aur scans the longer cuneiform tablet, which was a copy of knowledge transmitted for generations by scholarly families in the city of Assur, his eyes fall on the first incantation he needs on this very day, and he drafts this and related paragraphs onto the excerpt manuscript in hand. Having quickly cop - ied all the required sections, Kisir -Aur checks his copy against the original, he writes a colophon stating that the text is a hastily produced extract copied from and checked against its original, and finally he inscribes his name and records the date. The narrative above is fiction, although the discussed text is not. Known today as KAR 267, this manuscript's text and colophon provide us with infor - mation about the tablet's content and context (see Appendix 2). But how is it possible to use such information for analyzing Kiir -Aur 's education and career? This chapter provides the framework for conducting a microhistorical study of Kiir -Aur as an ipu- exorcist in a specific context at a certain place during a particular period. The study draws on the theory of microhistory as an analytical approach for studying smaller and select groups of texts to access previously unseen or otherwise unattainable information. Although there are inherent dangers of circular arguments within this analytical approach, ways of safeguarding such pitfalls are explored in the first section. The second sec- tion explores the methodological tools used, thereby providing an outline of how Kiir -Aur 's material is dissected throughout the following chapters. 1 The manuscript is KAR 267, and it was dated to the 9th of the month Ullu, see Section 7.5 and Appendix 1. The date above is calculated on the basis of Parpola's table for converting Assyrian dates into Julian ones (Parpola 1983a: 382). He states the 1st of Ullu corresponds to the 23rd of August in the year 658 BCE. The 9th must therefore correspond to the 31st. 2 The manuscripts investigated in this study consist of clay tablets with cuneiform writing. The texts are composed in the artificial literary dialect Standard Babylonian, which was based on the Old Babylonian dialect of the Semitic language Akkadian.15 Framework and Background Finally, this chapter provides a detailed discussion of the previous research on Kiir -Aur , the Bba- uma-ibni family and their tablet collection. 2.1 Microhistory Microhistory is an analytical approach employing a reduced scale of obser - vation for the intensive study of select texts to reveal information previously unseen or considered unattainable. This approach primarily uses philology to investigate the (extraordinary) documentation of a clearly defined small- scale area of interest, e.g., an event, a community, a family, or an individual person, and thereby illuminate the underlying structures of the subject.3 Therefore, microhistory challenges and contrasts quantitative datasets by analysing structures that are not reflected in the main bulk of historic documentation and cannot be recovered through conventional approaches.4 The method therefore allows \"concrete individual or local experience to re -enter history\" (Burke 2008: 45). Microhistory became well-known throughout the late 1970s and 1980s (Muir 1991: vii). Several of the most influential researchers of this period were affiliated with the so -called \"Italian school\" of microhistory, and one of the foremost works produced during this time remains the pioneering work The Cheese and the Worms by Carlo Ginzburg (1980).5 Broadly, the Italian school of microhistory searches for information concerning particular beliefs or behav - iour among social groups or milieus that may seem exceptional in relation to the contemporary political or religious norms.6 In several ways, microhistory draws indirectly on anthropology by employing an emic approach seeking to understand and describe the people and cultures investigated on their own terms (Muir 1 991: xi, xiii- xiv; Levi 1991: 98).7 Microhistory is rarely considered a theory as such, but rather a \"historio - graphical practice\" that draws on theoretical references in an eclectic manner 3 Szij\u00e1rt\u00f3 discussion of the term \"microhistory\" , see Ginzburg 2012; Muir 1991. For an overview of Ginzburg's impact and criticism of his work, see Szij\u00e1rt\u00f3 7 The term \"culture\" is here loosely defined. I realize that the term has problematic implica- tions, but as it is not employed as a fundamental term in this study I refer the reader to Burke (2008).16 Chapter 2 (Levi 1991: 93, 99-101). Giovanni Levi, another pioneer of the Italian school of microhistory, describes it as follows: Microhistory, in common with all experimental work, has no body of established orthodoxy to draw on. Levi 1991: 93 As a result of microhistory's theoretical eclecticism, this methodological approach contains some inherent problems. One problem concerns \"selec- tivity and significance\" (Muir 1991: xiv). Due to the focus on qualitative over quantitative documentation, it is the historian's responsibility to avoid over - emphasizing particular details when forming arguments. Another problem relates to the significance of spectacular observations within the select and often limited empirical basis for broader social groups or macrohistorical arguments.8 As a result, conclusions reached through microhistorical studies cannot automatically be transferred to a general historic sphere (see Ginzburg 2012: 207; Levi 1 991: 109; Ginzburg 1980: certain accepted. Muir (1991: xix) noted that \"microhistorical arguments, espe - cially those devoted to some form of cultural interpretation, are vulnerable to circularity\" , because the interpretations presuppose, in Ginzburg's words, \"a reciprocal interchange between the whole and the parts\" (Ginzburg 1985: 21; see also Simon 2015: 237). can provide nuanced and extraordinary infor - mation about aspects of society, its cultures, as well as individual persons, although it risks producing idiosyncratic and even trivial results. This needs to be evaluated in each specific case. Furthermore, microhistory cannot be pro - duced devoid of general historical context, and the influence of the two upon each other risks creating circular arguments (Ginzburg 1985: 21). Two means, both of which are employed throughout this study, serve to safeguard against such circular arguments: 1) the combination of exposing formal analogies within a limited dataset with verifying these through external evidence, and 2) the use of Occam's Razor to evaluate the interpretation with minimal hypoth- eses or variables as the most probable (Muir 1991: xix; see Ginzburg 1985: 21). 2.2 Framework In order to properly analyse Kiir -Aur 's texts via the microhistorical approach and extract useful information, it is necessary to establish a methodological 8 Muir 1991: xiv; see also Gregory 1999: 106, 108-109; Levi 1991: 95.17 Framework and Background framework. Using the archaeological information available, Kiir -Aur 's cuneiform tablets are investigated as part of a specific collection, as groups, as individual manuscripts, and in relation to their content to gain informa- tion about the use and functions of Kiir -Aur 's tablets in relation to his training and career.9 This study primarily uses philology to investigate Kiir - Aur 's manuscripts by providing thorough readings of texts or select passages to scrutinize particular vocabulary and investigate grammatical features and syntax in order to understand a text and outline its meaning (George 2007: 37). This approach is combined with recent advancements in Mesopotamian textual criticism (e.g., Delnero 2012; Worthington 2012). In relation to NA texts, textual criticism broadly involves studying minute textual changes in duplicate manuscripts and the mechanisms behind these, e.g., by identifying errors of transmission, to gain information about the methods and compe - tences of the transmitters of the texts.10 One premise of this study is that Kiir -Aur 's surviving cuneiform tablets with colophons can be used as the basis for partially reconstructing the con- tent and structure of his education, training, and career, thereby improving our understanding of Kiir -Aur 's career development. Three methodological issues related to this problem must be considered: 1) the danger of assigning too much significance to individual pieces of surviving evidence and obser - vations acquired through studying the texts, 2) the unknown impact of oral training, which could account for knowledge taught to Kiir -Aur by his father or other practitioners, which is not preserved in the surviving evidence, and 3) the nature of the N4 cuneiform tablet collection compared to other contem- porary collections. The first issue relates to the general problem of microhistor - ical studies, whereas the second issue is difficult to account for. The third issue is discussed below to provide the background necessary for studying Kiir - Aur (see Section 2.3.1). Throughout this work, these issues are addressed in order to contextualize specific findings. Kiir -Aur was part of the scholarly elite in Assur, although Robson (2019: 256) describes his family as part of \"the urban middle classes\". Still, subjects of microhistorical studies need not necessarily consist of common people (Lepore 2001: 131). Therefore, microhistory can also be an effective tool when 9 For contextualizing texts in relation to their collections, see, move from studying \"tablets as witnesses of scholarly compositions\" to analysing them derived 572-73). 2012: 38-40. emphasized that textual criticism can be problem- atic in relation to the evaluation of ancient textual variation or mistakes (Brisch 2015; see also Delnero 2012: 179-80; Worthington 2012: 41ff.).18 Chapter 2 studying individuals situated within spheres of power (e.g., Ginzburg 2015). Kiir -Aur is interesting because he was not attached to the royal court, but part of a local scholarly elite situated outside the seat of power. Furthermore, his family's text collection is the largest assembly of magico -medical cunei- form texts excavated outside of the royal libraries, and it is crucial for our reconstruction of Mesopotamian healing. Microhistory often approaches \"through the anomalous, not the analogous\" (Ginzburg 2012: 212-213), and thereby it attempts to solve small mysteries to elucidate broader historical questions (e.g., Lepore 2001: 133; Joyner 1999: 1). This is mirrored in my examinations of Kiir -Aur 's texts within the broader context of, e.g., anatomical and physiological knowledge as well as veterinar - ian medicine in Chapter 4, and paediatricians in Section 5.2.2. As the subjects of microhistorical studies are often devices for answering larger questions, the approach differs from biography (Lepore 2001). Therefore, this focus on hitherto unexplored avenues for reconstructing the education, practice and knowledge of a Mesopotamian healing professional establishes a foundation for future inquiries into these areas. 2.3 Background for Studying Kiir-Aur The so-called \"N4 library\" or \"Haus des Beschw\u00f6rungspriesters\" consisted of a private house located to the east or southeast of the original city centre in Assur (see Frahm 2011a: 268; Peders\u00e9n home to the Bba- uma-ibni family and it contained their tablet collection.11 The struc- ture was partly uncovered during the German excavations from 1903-1914, and the Iraqi excavations during the 1970s and 1980s continued to investigate the area.12 However, the complete layout of the N4 house remains 35). The German expediton, however, did not expose the entire house. As a result, the original interpretation did not link the areas hC-hE8I as a single home (cf. Preusser 1954: 58, pl. 27a). Parts of N4 were excavated during the Iraqi excavations in the 1970s and 80s (Jean 2006: 147; Peders\u00e9n 1998: 136 note 11; Ismail 1982). However, it remains unclear during which years the Iraqis excavated in which parts of the house (cf. Anonymous 1981: 173; see Miglus 2006: 146). Radner (1997: 290 and notes 1591-92) stated that the entire house was unearthed during the Iraqi excavations and refered to Finkbeiner and Pongratz-Leisten (1992). However, this map shows an out -dated layout of N4 (see Cavigneaux and Ismail 1998: 1). See Fadhil (2018: 192) for an overview of the excavated tablets and future publications.19 Framework and Background Figure 1 shows the layout of the building from the time of the Bba- uma-ibni family. Below I will summarize the most important features of the home before discussing the family's tablet collection. According to Miglus (1996: 237-38) and Peders\u00e9n (1986: 41-43 and note 2), the unexcavated entrance of the house probably lay to the southeast. Presum- ably, the red painted room 3 was once the main room of the house.13 To the south, room 6 must have led northwest through the unexcavated room(s) to the inner courtyard 7, which contained stone paving.14 This inner courtyard led to room 10 in its northernmost part. It was in room 10 that the majority of cuneiform tablets were discovered.15 Further west, the excavators found a 13 This room contained a niche to the left of the entrance from room 6 and another door between room 3 and 5 contained stone covered pivots (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 41; see Miglus 1996: 238). May (2018: 64 and notes 4-5) interprets the layout of rooms 3-4 as a \"bent axis\" , largely similar to those found in temples, some palaces or state buildings. Many magical figurines were found underneath the floors of these rooms. Perhaps the family performed rituals here for themselves or clients (Robson 2019: 130; May 2018: 64). 14 Between room 10 and courtyard 7 excavators found two parallel foundations of walls (Miglus 1996: 238). The northwest one was 0,3 m deeper than the southeast one (ibid.; cf. Maul 2010a: 190-92; Peders\u00e9n 1986: 41, note 4). Miglus suggested that the northwest foun- dation was the remains of an older wall separating room 10 and courtyard 7 (Miglus 1996: 238). Peders\u00e9n used the excavation report stating that the tablets were found underneath a house to suggest this \"house\" may have been the northwest wall (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 42 and note 4). This remains unclear. Note that the N4 house may have been sold during S\u00een- ar- ikun 's reign (B\u00f6hme 2010). The N4 house was possibly destroyed in a fire, most likely during the (partial) destruction of Assur in 614 BCE (Maul 2010a: 190-92). Therefore, the house was mostly empty. It has been presumed that original shelves for storing tablets, household goods, furniture, and other equipment were burned in antiquity or destroyed (Maul 2003: 176; see Miglus 1996: 236-41). the \"library room\". Peders\u00e9n (1986: 42 and note 6) states that his text groups C, D, G, L, M and perhaps including H, I, N, O, and Q are all from room 10 (see Figure 1 The N4 house (Miglus 1996: pl. 132d, reproduced with permission) 20 Chapter 2 vaulted underground grave in room 11, which unfortunately had been robbed in antiquity (see Haller 1954: 163 no. 67 = Ass. 14508). Room 11 contained the outer wall of the western part of the N4 house, as well as a small group of administrative tablets and an ivory writing -board.16 A relatively large number of apotropaic figurines and clay plaques depicting various protective beings were found beneath the floors and thresholds of rooms 1, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 11 in clay brick boxes, jars and small clay pods.17 2.3.1 The N4 Tablet Collection The tablets excavated in N4 constitute the largest text collection from the city of Assur, and so far, 1,242 cuneiform tablets and fragments have been identified as coming from the N4 house.18 The majority of the tablets were found broken and had been sundried in antiquity (Maul 2010a: 191; Maul 2003: 175; Peders\u00e9n 1986: 42). Based on the archaeological context, it is reasonable to assume that they were stored in room 10 of the N4 house (Peders\u00e9n 1998: 135). Unfortunately, it remains uncertain where in room 10 the texts were discovered (Maul 2010a: 192 note 14, 217-18; cf. Robson 2019: 129). The colophons mainly refer to the also Ismail 1982: 199; cf. Maul 2010a: 192 note 14). Maul (2010a: 191 note 13) emphasizes that at least 150 tablets and fragments were discovered in N4 by the Iraqis, not 50 as described by Ismail. Miglus (1996: 238) states that the groups of tablets labelled Ass. 13955 and 13956 and perhaps also Ass. 17721 and 17722 likely came from room 10. The number of tablets and fragments from N4 continue to increase with every additional fragment assigned to this collection (see the development of numbers in Maul 44, 47) noted that almost half of the archives excavated in Assur were found in inner rooms with tombs underneath. Around 10 further tablets were found scattered throughout the eastern parts of the house (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 42-43 groups A, B, E, F). 17 and some contain inscriptions, e.g., mtu erba \"Go see Peders\u00e9n 1986: 43 note 9). Some vessels contained traces of Approximately one of the original number of texts likely contained colophons. Because the German excava- tions from 1903-1914 were conducted under Ottoman rule, the collective sum of tablets were divided between Berlin and Istanbul, whereas the tablets later excavated by the Iraqi expeditions are presumably kept in Baghdad (Maul 2010: 193 and notes 16-17; see Kraus 1947: 94, 101-104). Some tablets probably went to other collections or private collectors (e.g., Scheil 1918). The whereabouts of certain tablets, such as RA 15 pl. 76, are unknown today (see Appendix 2).21 Framework and Background Bba- uma-ibni 196, 203, 208-10; see below). The N4 collection held a variety of texts, many of which relate to various forms of healing.19 A large group contains diagnoses, prescriptions, recipes, and instructions for applying treatments for various medical symptoms and illnesses, as well as pharmacological texts for identifying and applying medical substances (Maul 2010a: 198). Another large group consists of rituals, incanta- tions, and prayers for treating and removing demons, evils, witchcraft, and bad omens, as well as for influencing and restoring the human relationships with various gods (see Schwemer 2011). Additional texts relate to aggressive magic to gain control over other individuals (ibid.: 431-32). Other texts include lexical lists, god lists, hemerological texts, various liter - ary texts such as the Erra Epic, and a text on Yet another group of texts relate to the Aur temple, the Marduk statue's captivity in Assyria, the topog - raphy of the city of Assur, royal rituals, kings and their scholars, royal decrees, and the Assyrian army (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 56-58; Maul 2010a: 198). Finally, a group of textual commentaries, mainly on rituals, also formed part of the discovery (Frahm 2011a: 268-70). It is remarkable that the N4 rela- tively few omen texts (Koch 2015: 325-26 and note 894). Besides the collection in room 10, the administrative texts excavated in room 11 may represent an archive. However, the texts relate to, e.g., rations for various persons, such as temple personnel, who are otherwise unattested in N4.20 The N4 collection existed within the private confines of the N4 house, which most likely was inhabited by the Bba- uma-ibni family (Maul 2010a: 201). However, several individuals who were not members of this family are attested in the N4 collection, albeit frequently only in a single colophon (Fadhil 2012: 36-43). These individuals often belong to the elite of Assur's priesthood or temple administrations and they left tablets in the collection, perhaps as gifts 19 Robson 199), and Schwemer (2017: 50-51) have recently stressed that the writing -boards presumably missing today from the N4 collection could produce a false impression concerning some aspects of the content. See Section 3.6.1. 20 Maul 2010a: 201 and note 41-42; Peders\u00e9n 1998: 136. For an overview of Kiir -Aur 's texts in copies and editions, see Appendix 1. The majority of literary and scholarly texts from N4 can be found in handcopies in publications such as KAR, KAH, LKA, BAM , and KAL. Additionally, many texts are published in articles (e.g., Scheil 1918; Labat and Tournay 1945-46; Cavigneaux and Ismail 1998). The N4 archival texts are only partially published, see Ch. 8 note 111.22 Chapter 2 or through exchange (Maul 2010a: 212 and note 77).21 Additionally, some young sons of priestly or scholarly families from Assur left tablets in the collection during their time spent there in their amall\u00fb eru- and amalll\u00fb-phases , Maul 2010a: 99-101; see also May 2018: 70-77). It is therefore likely that such apprentices in NA Assur spent time studying associated disciplines under the roof of other families (Maul 2010a: 217 and note 102).22 It seems that only one family member per generation, most likely the first - born son, was responsible for the continuation of the collection (Maul 2010a: 206-207 and notes 62 and 65-66; see May 2018: 66 note 14). His brothers would probably have moved to other houses and formed new collections there. Maul argued that this could explain why certain works, such as Sa- gig, are missing from N4 (see Section 3.6.1). Several texts show that the Bba- uma-ibni family copied texts from manuscripts, which were not kept in the collection (Maul 2010a: 213; see Section 9.5.1). Maul considered it likely that the family copied tablets from their colleagues' collections (ibid.). This is based on certain protection and curse formulae found in some N4 manuscripts, which may indicate that colleagues had access to N4 texts (ibid.: 214).23 Therefore, it is possible that N4 should be labelled a \" semi-private text collection\" , although it is unknown to what extent labels such as \"private\" can be applied to the ancient world. 2.3.2 Excursus: Discussion of the Term \"Library\" The term \"library\" is used in studies to refer to the N4 text collection due to its content.24 However, researchers use the term for lack of a more appropriate alternative.25 In Assyriology, the term is generally used to designate the con- tent of a given archaeological space in which a number of literary or scholarly texts was excavated. This is regularly contrasted with the term \"archive\" , which 21 There appears to be no evidence for selling or buying texts in Mesopotamia (Maul 2010a: 212). 22 In later periods, the elementary primary education seems to have been connected to from N4: \u00e0 IR dA[G] Z\u00c0-\u00fa liq-b[i], his disappearance\". Maul (2010a: 214 and note 89-91) also compares this to the LB scholarly texts from Uruk, where the colophons contain curses should the loaner not bring back the tablet on the same evening or a specified day. 24 E.g., \"Bibliothek\" , Maul 2010a; \"library\" , Peders\u00e9n 1986: 41. Both researchers are aware of the terminological limitations. 25 Groups of texts cannot always be called an \"archive\" or a \"library\" conclusively (see Peders\u00e9n 1998: 3). See also discussions in du Toit 1998; Black and Tait 1995.23 Framework and Background encompasses texts with administrative, economic, epistolary, or legal content.26 The term \"library\" can be problematic as it has connotations concerning the form and function of text collections.27 This is especially a result of the Library of Alexandria's influence on the later ideals of the ancient library as an institu- tion with an all- encompassing and static collection of texts.28 However, the Mesopotamian scholarly text collections of the first millennium BCE were not institutionalized, static, similar, or all-encompassing, but often shaped by indi- vidual needs and interests 2013: 56).29 Concerning the N4 collection, Maul (2010a: 215-16 and note 92) has suggested that it was primarily used for professional training and practice, and it can perhaps be regarded as a physi- cal manifestation of the owners' personal qualifications. This study generally refers to the texts from the N4 house as the \"N4 (text) collection\". Yet, although this work recognizes the problems inherent in the term \"library\" , the Nineveh text collections are referred to as libraries, and in general the terms \"library\" and \"collection\" are used interchangeably to broadly designate a collection of literary, historically, or scholarly texts kept in one or more rooms in a building used by learned individuals. 2.3.3 The Bba-uma-ibni Family Seven members of the Bba- uma-ibni family are known by name, and pos - sibly two additional members should be included in the genealogy, over five generations (cf. Maul 2010a: 203, 206 note 62). The named individuals are Bba- (Radner See Robson 2013: 40-41. For the problems related to the term \"archive\" in relation to such groups of texts, see the articles in Brosius 2003. See also Maul 2010a: 217 note 104. 27 Robson 2013: 38; see Michalowski 2003 and the articles concerning the term \"library\" in Veenhof 1986b. For a critique of the term \"library\" as applied to Assurbanipal's collections, see Robson 2019: du Toit 1998: 391-92. examples of temple libraries with so -called \"pigeon holes\" for storing tablets on shelves are known from NA Dr-arrukn (Loud and Altman 1938 pl. 19c; cf. ibid. pl 24d) and the NB ama temple in Sippar in which tablets were found in situ on the shelves (Al Jadir 1998; Anonymous 1987: 248-49 and pl. 47; see also for further references Maul 2010a: 217 and note 105; Potts 2010: 28-29; Al-Rawi 1994: 135 note 1; Al-Rawi and George 1990: 149 note 1). For other similar NA uses in Nineveh and Kalu, see Veenhof 1986a: 2 note 5, 13 and notes 50-51 with further references. Occasionally, the Mesopotamians used the word gerginakku to describe a room in which scholarly tablets were placed (Robson 2013: 41). Other problems related to text collections concern access - ability and the availability of texts (see, e.g., Robson 2011a).24 Chapter 2 2000: 201). Figure 2 represents the Bba- uma-ibni family tree. Several of the individuals are only attested in a single N4 tablet or through genealogies in colophons.30 Zimmern (1915-16: 184 and note 1) appears to have been the first to comment on the names of the Bba- uma-ibni family mem- Ebeling 1920-23). However, it was not until Scheil's treatments of this family's tablets that a genealogy was albeit as the \"Archiv der Tempelschule in Assur\" and provided additional correlations between some tablets and titles within the family (Meier 1937-39: 240 and note 25, 245-46 and notes 33-38; see Weidner 1937-39: 147-48). He also placed the family in the middle of the 7th century BCE. However, Labat and Tournay (1945-46: 121-22) were the first to attempt a reconstruction of a complete family tree. Unfortunately, they misinterpreted 30 Only one tablet has been identified from, e.g., Aur -ndin-a (PKTA pl. 19+ = SAA 20 no. 17, see also Ch. 2 note 57). The unnamed son of Abu- erba, and father of Aur -ndin- a, is attested only in this text. BAM 102 rev. 7: [... ZAB]AR.DAB .B[A ...] may have contained the name of Bba- uma-ibni's father. This text is the only one that possibly provides an older ancestor, and it is the basis for an unknown ancestor appearing above Bba- uma-ibni in the family tree. However, the evidence The Bba- uma-ibni dabb\u00fb-priest of the Aur Temple ( Earr a)25 Framework and Background the phrase a Nab\u00fb tuklassu as a name and based an additional name on a problematic copy by Scheil (1918: 77). It was not until Hunger (1968: 19) corrected the previous genealogies that the Kiir -Aur branch of the family tree and the attested career phases were properly understood.31 However, Nab\u00fb-bssunu's brother, Abu- erba, remained 44-46) hinted at Abu- erba 's grandson, Aur - ndin-ae, being part of this family (cf. Peders\u00e9n 1998: 135-36). Jean (2006: 189) provided a revised family tree with Abu- erba and Aur -ndin-a whom she believed was Abu- erba 's son. However, Maul's recent treatment of the family demonstrated that an unknown individual represents the son of Abu- erba and the father of Aur -ndin-a see Fadhil 2012: as [Kii]r -A[ur] in 20 no. 17).32 However, Parpola's colla- tions of the text show that this reconstruction is extremely tenuous (Parpola 2017: 216; see also May 2018: 69 note 61). Furthermore, such a reconstruction would be very problematic for assigning colophons to Nab\u00fb-bssunu's son Kiir -Aur . As a result, this hypothesis is disregarded here and the name of Abu- erba 's son remains unknown. Maul's reconstruction of the Bba- uma- ibni family genealogy therefore remains authoritative, although this study adds a presumed ancestor of Bba- uma-ibni who is possibly mentioned in BAM 102.33 2.3.4 The Attested Training and Career Phases Kiir -Aur 's colophons in particular make it possible to distinguish a set of six consecutive phases with titles that attest to the training and career of the individuals. The titles mamau eru 31 Many additional texts from this family appeared during these years in K\u00f6cher's publica- tions of the N4 medical and pharmacological texts (K\u00f6cher 1955, 1963a, 1963b, 1964, 1971). 32 SAA no. 17 rev. 114-16. 33 Recently, Natalie May has suggested that the ancestor with the broken name is to be iden- tified as Bba- uma-iddina, who was also the patronymic ancestor of a family of as\u00fbs serving as ang\u00fb-priests of the god Baba in Assur (May 2018: 71-74). This family is also known from manuscripts in the N4 collection (ibid.: 71-72 and note 81). It is possible that the Bba- uma-iddina of these families is attested in the N24 in Assur (ibid.: 73; Deller et al. 1995: 126-128 no. 136 = N24 no. 11). 34 The normalization of the title (l\u00fa)\u00c1MAN/DUGUD .L\u00c1 MA.MA TUR varies \"exorcist\" , and of the Aur temple\".35 Although amall\u00fb eru is the earliest attested title, it becomes clear in Chapter 3 that such \"junior apprentices\" in N4 must have received a basic education in writing and reading cuneiform script beforehand (Maul 2010a: 210 note 74; Gesche 2001; Finkel 2000). Furthermore, from at least the amall\u00fb eru-phase onwards, it is possible that the father of the apprentice in question or another scholar acted as teacher and instructor.36 The family members are described in several colophons as connected to the Aur temple (Maul 2010a: 200-201 and note 40), although it remains uncertain whether these titles designated actual duties (see Sections 8.1 and 8.6). Current research agrees that the six phases attested for Kiir -Aur can be arranged in a sequence that records a progression from junior to senior (Maul 2010a; hypothesis can therefore be considered uncontroversial, although it is generally unknown how long individual phases lasted, and whether some phases overlapped.37 Additional titles are attested for several individuals within the Bba- uma- ibni family, and yet other titles are known for individuals outside this family that are also attested in N4 (e.g., \"novice as\u00fb-physician \" as\u00fb agag\u00fb, BAM 1 col. iv 27).38 The text BAM 102 may refer to an ancestor of Bba- uma-ibni as a zabardabb\u00fb-priest.39 Furthermore, Bba- uma-ibni is generally referred to as 35 Maul 2010a: 208-11 and notes 67, 70, 74; Hunger see also Baker 2017: publications reconstructed the phase amall\u00fb \"apprentice\" for Kiir Aur between (e.g., Baker 2017: 160; Maul 2010a: 208) on the basis of information provided in Peders\u00e9n's catalogue of tablets from the N4 text collection concerning the texts N4 no. 237, 241 and 289 (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 45). However, these previously unpublished texts must now be considered part of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase (see Section 3; Arb\u00f8ll 10 no. 4 and the newly identified N4 no. 175 belonged to his amall\u00fb-phase. 36 Frahm (2011a: 269 note 1277) suggested that Kiir may have acted as the instructor of Kiir -Nab\u00fb, but this remains hypothetical. 37 It cannot be excluded that some phases were abbreviations for others, e.g., the title mamau eru could be an abbreviated form of amall\u00fb mamau eru (Andrew George, personal communication). Note that there are no attestations where N4 family members employ two titles in a colophon (see May 2018: 65 note 10). However, it remains unclear if a practitioner at the top of his career could yield a title from a previous phase. For example, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's father ama -ibni was mama bt Aur when Kiir -Nab\u00fb was mamau eru in AfO 12 pl. 13-14, but he appears as mamau (BAM 199) and MA. MA -ma (KAR 33; LKA 93) when Kiir -Nab\u00fb was mamau. 38 For examples of agag\u00fb and apprenticeship titles, see Robson 2014: 152; Robson 2011a: 564-65. be \"Bronze(- object) holder\" , although a symbolic meaning had probably lost its value by the first millennium BCE due to changes in the function of the 27 Framework and Background zabardabbi Earra in Kiir -Aur 's colophons, except for LKA In LKA 119, Bba- uma-ibni is mama bt Aur.41 He is also referred to as the \"exorcist of the temple of totality\" (mama bt kiti) in Nab\u00fb-bssunu's KAR 31,42 which may be a variant of mama bt Aur (Maul 2010: 200, note 40, 203 note 47).43 Nab\u00fb-bssunu, Abu- exorcist\" (mamau aur\u00fb(?), reading uncertain) at some point during their career (Maul 2010a: 209 and note 69).44 Whether this refers to an exorcist with duties on behalf of the city of Assur or an exorcist defined as a special type from the city of Assur remains uncertain.45 Additionally, ama -ibni is attested as both title (see CAD Z: 6; CDA : 442). The title is used infrequently in the NA period, although it is clearly cultic in nature (May 2018: 66-67). 40 The only text currently identified as from Bba- uma-ibni is KAL 4 no. 36, wherein he was likely za[bardabbi Earra(?)]. Upon collation, this was also his title in 230 rev. 15: \u00c9-ar-ra(?)]. 41 Two ancestors with fragmentary names are listed as mama bt Aur in KAL 4 no. 37. See the discussion in Ch. 6 note 66 and Maul 2010a: 200 note 40. 42 This title is the Akkadian translation of Sumerian \u00c9.\u00c1R .RA. 43 Furthermore, it is possible that Bba- uma-ibni was identified as a \"senior ang\u00fb-priest\" (ang\u00fb rab\u00fb) of an unknown temple in BAM 50, and the text may have been written by Nab\u00fb-bssunu (Maul 2010a: 203 and 67 (= BAK no. 191-192); cf. May 2017: 98). If the text was written by Nab\u00fb-bssunu, he misspelled his name, as K\u00f6cher's copy rev. 25 reads: DUB -pi p.d<PA >-bi-su-n[u x x x x]. The CDLI picture cannot confirm this reading and fur - ther collation is necessary. The picture may agree with the reading SANGA GA[L] in rev. 26, but it shows that only a few signs can be reconstructed before it, and Bba- uma-ibni's name may be too long. According to May (2018: 67 note 32, 76 note 110), recent collations of BAM 50 show the text should not be attributed to Nab\u00fb-bssunu. 44 For Nab\u00fb-bssunu, see LKA 109 rev. 15': [DUB(?)] l\u00faMA. 129). For Abu- erba, see KAL 2 no. 34 - Nab\u00fb, see below. Notably, Nab\u00fb-bssunu is mama bt Aur in all Kiir -Aur 's colo - phons, although Maul (2010a: 210 and note 70) refers to a tablet from Kiir -Aur in which Nab\u00fb-bssunu was \"Assur exorcist\" without providing the reference. This text must be unpublished, because there are no indications at present that Nab\u00fb-bssunu's broken title in a number of Kiir -Aur colophons should be reconstructed as \"Assur For small variations in Nab\u00fb-bssunu's title in Kiir -Aur 's tablets, see KAR 63 rev. 25': MA. MA \u00c9 A -ur-ma, and KAR 80 (= KAL 2 no. 8) rev. 39: l\u00faME.ME \u00c9 A[N.\u00c1R ]. It seems that Kiir -Aur did not supply a title for Nab\u00fb-bssunu in BAM 307. 45 Maul (2010a: 209) translates the title \"'Beschw\u00f6rer' von Assur\" without transcription. Fadhil (2012: 46) provides a reference to another person claiming the title mamau aur\u00fb, which is spelled URU BAL .TILki-u (see Hunger 1968: 85 no. 256). I disregard the possibility that this title would be a marker of ethnicity, as it is spelled URU and not KUR and that the majority of exorcists within Assur must have been Assyrian (see also Section 9.5.3).28 Chapter 2 mama bt Aur and mama Earra (Maul 2010a: 209-10 and notes 68 and 73), and he is occasionally provided with the variant MA.MA -ma for the title mamau.46 At present, it cannot be established if some of these phases are missing in Kiir -Aur 's colophons or if he simply never claimed these titles. Only one of the Bba- uma-ibni family texts contains an exact date, namely Kiir -Aur 's KAR 267 that is dated to the 9th of Ullu (August -September) 658 BCE (see Section 7.5; Maul 2010: 205). Maul assumed that each genera- tion preceding and following Kiir -Aur could be dated within approximately 30 year intervals from the year 658 BCE, and he suggested that the middle of Nab\u00fb-bssunu's career should be dated around the year 688 BCE and Bba- uma-ibni's around 718 BCE. It seems that the majority of the family's members reached a stage that allowed them to claim the title mama bt Aur. The only exception appears to be Kiir -Nab\u00fb, who possibly became only \"Assur exorcist\" , and Aur -ndin-a who is attested in only one text as amall\u00fb eru.47 Maul attributed the fragmentary king list KAV 182 to Kiir -Nab\u00fb, even though the copyist's name is broken (Maul 2010a: 204 note 51, 209 note 69). This text ends with the NA king Aur -etel-iln (627-623 BCE), and if the text was copied by Kiir -Nab\u00fb it would have been copied during this king's reign (ibid.). It is plau- sible that Kiir -Nab\u00fb did not reach the stage of mama bt Aur before the city of Assur fell in 614 BCE (ibid.: 205 note 54, 211; cf. note 595), yet it remains uncertain if Kiir -Aur was still alive and active by this time (cf. ibid.: 205 and note 54). Maul identified the names of Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb in 122 colophons in the N4 collection, which would suggest that the collection had been enlarged during their time, around the middle and the second half of the 7th century BCE (Maul 2010a: 204-205 and notes 49 and 55-56). A few tablets show that the collection was founded around the time of Bba- uma-ibni, who was prob - ably a contemporary of Sargon II (722-705 BCE).48 The evidence from N4 suggests that the male members of the Bba- uma-ibni family strove towards claiming the title mama bt Aur (Maul 2010a: 210-11). However, Maul (ibid.: 206) has argued that several persons within the family could claim the title at the same time. As a result, he refers to this family as a \"Kollegium\" of mama bt Aurs (ibid.), which may have had a similar structure as other guilds known from Assur around the same time (see Radner 1999b: 25-33). 46 See KAR 33; LKA 93. 47 See Ch. 2 note 55, Ch. 8 note 18, Table 1 note h. 48 As argued by Maul (2010a: 206 and note 58) on the basis of two texts dated to 714 BCE (Thureau-Dangin 1912) and 713 BCE (KAR 252). He also notes that LKA 53 mentions the name of Sargon II. See Maul 1994: 159; Peders\u00e9n 1986: 44.29 Framework and Background 2.3.5 Other References to Members of the Bba-uma-ibni Family We know almost nothing about the Bba- uma-ibni family members as pri- vate individuals. As discussed above in Section 2.3.1, the family must have been affiliated with numerous influential families and, as indicated by their titles, also with the Aur temple. However, only four documents outside of the N4 collection might mention members of the Bba- uma-ibni family. The first one is the letter SAA 10 no. 102 from Akkullnu, a prominent ang\u00fb-priest at the Aur temple in Assur,49 which contains a broken passage that describes a certain Kiir -Aur copying tablets for the royal libraries in Nineveh.50 The sec- ond is the letter SAA 13 no. 39, perhaps from our Nab\u00fb-bssunu, addressed to a certain Aur -mudammiq who is to provide silver to the Akkullnu mentioned above for repairing the seats of Aur and Mullissu.51 Furthermore, Kiir -Aur of the N4 house is perhaps mentioned alongside other individuals connected to the Aur temple in SAA 13 no. 155.52 And finally, ama -ibni may have been in charge of offerings at the Aur temple in SAA 7 no. 211.53 Parpola dated a letter with related content to SAA 10 no. 102, namely no. 101, to around the year 655 BCE, which would date no. 102 to the same time (Villard 1998: 19; Parpola 1983a: 347). However, several individuals are known from this period with the name Kiir -Aur (Baker 2000: 623-24), and it remains uncertain if Kiir -Aur actually copied manuscripts for the Nineveh libraries (see Sections 7.6 and 9.5.4; cf. May 2018: 68, 78; 205). Nonetheless, the Bba- uma-ibni family was connected to families who produced tablets for 49 Akkullnu also reported on astrological matters to the Assyrian king (see Villard 2007: 326-27; Radner notes 43-44) regards Akkullnu as an indicator for a connection between the N4 scholarly environment and the royal court based on his astrological reports. However, Akkullnu only wrote 12 out of 243 astro - logical reports from Assyrian scholars to the NA kings, and none of his texts demonstrate access to the inner circle at Nineveh (SAA 8: 60ff.). 50 May 2018: 68; Maul 2010a: 205 and copying Ur-ra \". May (2018: 68) provides an overview of Ur-ra manuscripts and amulet stone lists from N4 and concludes that Kiir -Aur was \"a great specialist on stones and lexical lists\" (see also ibid.: 78). However, Kiir -Aur 's texts with colophons do not substantiate this hypothesis. 51 May 2018: 68 and note 40; Villard 2007: 326. However, this would be the only instance where Nab\u00fb-bssunu's name is written AG -EN-\u00fa-nu. 52 May 2018: 69-70. The letter is directed to the king by an anonymous author concerning the future sacrifices in Assur conducted by five individuals, among these a certain Kiir - Aur . However, the letter shows no clear connection to the Nineveh court, and it only shows that a Kiir -Aur was perhaps involved in the Aur temple cult. 53 May 2018: 69. The text states that a certain ama -ibni was responsible for offerings on the 24th day of an uncertain month.30 Chapter 2 the Nineveh collections, such as Marduk -allim-a, who is attested in colo - phons from N4 and Nineveh (Fadhil 2012: 40-41 Kiir-Aur's Texts -Aur is the N4 individual to whom most colophons can be assigned. Throughout this work I also include other texts from the N4 collection for which text-internal criteria make it likely that they can be assigned to Kiir - Aur . Maul (2010a) has offered the most recent and in- depth treatment of the various phases of the Bba- uma-ibni family members' training and careers.54 In his study, Maul identified and assigned 78 texts to Kiir -Aur and 44 texts to Kiir -Nab\u00fb, totalling 122 texts.55 Maul also listed the number of tablets assigned to each of the other Bba- uma-ibni family members. Unfortunately, Maul did not provide a full catalogue of these texts, and it is therefore unclear if there are unpublished or fragmentary texts among them. The current study attempts to remedy the situation for Kiir -Aur , although an inherent problem is that many colophons are partly damaged and in several instances it is impossible to identify the name of the owner, copyist, or writer beyond Kiir -[...]. Thus, a number of texts may refer to either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb, although gene - alogies or preserved titles can occasionally aid in the reconstruction. Figure 3 illustrates how many tablets from the available material can be attributed to Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb, and how many remain of uncertain attribution. These numbers do not completely agree with the data collected by Maul.56 In total, there are 125 texts bearing Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb's name, with 73 texts Kiir -Aur , 39 texts to Kiir -Nab\u00fb, and 13 texts that cannot be safely assigned to either man. This study therefore provides three additional texts compared to Maul's overview.57 However, with the continious publication 54 Stefan Maul is the principal investigator of the project Edition literarischer Keilschrifttexte aus Assur, which aims to publish the literary, historical and scholarly texts excavated dur - ing the German excavations from 1903-1914 in Assur. 55 Maul 2010a: 205 note 56, 208-10; see May 2018: 65. Additionally, Maul states that eight tablets were written by Nab\u00fb-bssunu, presumably one by Aur -ndin-a, and one each by Abu- erba and Bba- uma-ibni (Maul 2010a: 205-206 note 55 and 60). 56 Adding to the confusion is, e.g., Farber's statement that LKA 114 was written in the hand of Kiir -Nab\u00fb, although no such name is preserved on the colophon (Farber 1989: 23-24). It has not been possible to provide a description of Kiir -Aur 's handwriting, although such an attempt is a desideratum. 57 Couto -Ferreira (2018: 163) listed BAM of -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru manu- scripts. However, the collations in CMAwR 1: 318-335 and pl. 132 no. 63 show that the colophon in rev. 3' states: [... PA ]B??.ME l\u00fa\u00c1MAN .L\u00c1 TUR (cf. ibid.: 322 note 79). 31 Framework and Background of new texts it is possible additional tablets or new joins may appear in the future that can modify the individual observations made here.58 Table 1 divides these 125 tablets according to titles, in accordance with the titles established in Section 2.3.4. The table also notes the differences between this study and the numbers provided by Maul (2010a: 208-209), which are marked separately in parenthesis (X My number / (Y Maul's number )). I have divided the texts assigned to Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb according to what can be read on the collated tablets and published copies, and only in a few individ- ual cases have the titles been reconstructed (see Appendix 1). Additionally, I have included a number of unpublished texts carrying Kiir -Aur 's name, and in some instances a title (courtesy of Nils Hee\u00dfel, Stefan Maul and Daniel Schwemer; colophons that have been recon- structed by their editors without sufficient evidence have been disregarded and will be discussed where relevant. I argue for further reconstructions in some colophons and for assigning other texts to specific career phases throughout the following chapters. Consequently, the numbers presented below are not absolute. Maul has a total of 49 texts with titles from Kiir -Aur and 20 texts with titles from Kiir -Nab\u00fb, but does not list tablets with broken titles or completely without titles. These texts are added here separately to nuance the study. Furthermore, several of the tablets with and without titles include a phrase stating: \"(he) whose trust is Nab\u00fb\" (a Nab\u00fb tuklassu; Section 5.4). Although this is not a title, it is used throughout this study as a criterion for assigning Accordingly, it is possible the name once read Aur -ndin-a, the grandson of Abu- erba. However, other individuals attested in N4 have names ending in -a (see Fadhil 2012: 36-42). 58 Other colophons from N4 contain only the purpose for copying the tablet or other infor - mation (e.g., LKA 88 = N4 no. 162). These are therefore without names and are disregarded here. Note that Anmar Fadhil is currently working with unpublished texts from the Iraqi excavations of N4, among which there are no clear colophons that can be assigned to Bba- uma-ibni family members (personal communication).Figure 3 Texts assigned -Aur and texts)Ki/uni1E63ir -Nab\u00fb (39 te xts)32 Chapter 2 Table 1 Texts assigned to Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's career Phrase Kiir-Aur Kiir-Nab\u00fb Undetermined amall\u00fb erub 12 / (10) - - amall\u00fbc 2 / (3) - - amall\u00fb mamau erud 3 / (2) - - mamau erue 1 / (1) 2 / (3) - mamauf 8 / (8) 12 / (15) 1 mamau + [broken title(?)]g - 1 - mamau aur\u00fb(?)h - 1 / (2) - mama bt Auri 25 / (25) - - No titlej 15 16 1 Possibly broken titlek 7 7 11 In Total 73 Texts 39 Texts 13 Texts a The totals are listed in Maul 2010: 205 notes 55-56, 209.

For the last text as a amall\u00fb eru text, see Table 2 note b. c The three manuscripts listed by Maul are presumably the unpublished texts N4 no. 237, 241, and 289 included among Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase tablets, see Ch. 2 note 35.

Several of the tablets including this phrase are for now listed under the title or no title/broken title in Table 1.59 From the above numbers, the most significant divergence of my study from Maul's is the number of tablets assigned and amall\u00fb mamau eru-phases .60 At least one additional tablet without a formal title (BAM 9) is argued in Section 5.4.1 as belonging to the amall\u00fb eru-phase, which would bring the total to 13 tablets. Four tablets with the title mama bt Aur contain a fragmentary name and cannot be assigned to Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb based on genealogy.61 However, as dis - cussed above, Kiir -Nab\u00fb may never have reached this phase, and by extension these texts are included as part of Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase.62 The remaining undetermined tablets must have belonged to either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb. Although not all of these texts can be argued to belong to one of them specifically, they still represent knowledge used within this family. 59 The texts with this phrase, with or without titles, are BAM 9, BAM 121, KAL 4 no. 37, LKA 89+, LKA 141, RA 15 pl. 76. 60 Maul (2010a: 208) originally listed ten amall\u00fb eru texts and three amall\u00fb texts, but since his study, the three texts identified at the time of Maul's study from Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb-phase have been shown to belong to his amall\u00fb eru-phase (see Ch. 2 note 35, Table 1 note c). 61 The texts are BAM 28, BAM 321, LKA 157, and PKTA pl. 10-11. The last text does not preserve any names, and as such, it is not entirely certain it was copied by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb, but see Section 8.6. 62 For the colophon of BAM 28, see Section 8.2.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 004 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Chapter 3 Kiir-Aur's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru Kiir -Aur was likely in his teens when he began his earliest career stage as a \"young apprentice\" (amall\u00fb eru). By then, Kiir -Aur is assumed to have completed his primary education and begun a process of specialization (cf. Gesche 2001: 210 and its review in George 2003-04 and Veldhuis 2003). He must therefore already have undergone the education necessary for him to acquire basic reading and writing skills for various subgenres of iptu. Supposedly, students of any craft were not 219; Cohen and Kedar 2011: 240; Kedar 2014: 540). We can only estimate the years spent during education through comparative material, and suggestions for the age at which students began their education range from five (Waetzoldt 1974: 9) to 14-15 years of age (Gehlken 2005: 106 and note 25; Cohen and Kedar 2011: 240-41 with further references).1 The length of a complete education may have been as much as ten years (Wiggermann 2008: 211; Waetzoldt 1989: 38), but in the Book of Daniel the education of an astrologer is three years.2 In the MA period, two brothers likely had the uparru eru title for at least three years (Jakob 2003: 257). Apprentices probably trained through (competitive) team- work under the tutelage of a senior colleague or family member.3 Although the amall\u00fb eru phase is Kiir -Aur 's earliest attested phase, he was already copying complicated medical knowledge. This could indicate that the Bba- uma-ibni family did not follow the later Babylonian educa- tional phases established by Gesche, but instead utilized a curriculum targeted at training practical skills. The following table is a list of the texts written by 1 Guinan and Leichty (2008) published an OB school text that had deliberately been bitten into by the student and subsequently broken. The dental marks were identified as belonging to an individual around 12 to 13 years old. The content was the lexical text Proto -Ea, which \"was studied toward the end of the first year of scribal training\" (ibid.: 50). They conclude, for the OB period: \"The beginning of school would have coincided with the reaching of sexual maturity\" (ibid.). See Pearce and Doty 2000: 337-38. 2 Book Daniel chapter 219 note 840-42. 3 is-se-\u00fa-nu -Aur as amall\u00fb eru. I have assigned the texts to three groups, namely, medical texts, ritual texts and other texts, as specified in Section 1.2.3. The text BAM 9 is not explicitly supplied with the amall\u00fb eru title in the colophon, but Section 5.4.1 argues for its place among these tablets. Consequently, it is included in the following table: Table 2 Texts assigned to Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb ehru-phase Area Text Content Format and designation Medical textsBAM 129 Obverse, col. i-ii: incantations col. iii(broken)-iv: six treatments and four diagnoses for aau in various (col. iv 18') the patient, and possibly fumigating his bed (col. iv 6'-13' , 14'-17')Two-columned on each side; [...] BAM 201 prescriptions 1'-41') with additional four preserved symptom descriptions for \"ditto\" (obv. 16'), a man with swollen insides and fever ill with \"Hand of curse\" and kadabbed\u00fb (obv. 23'-25'), a man throwing up blood and pus (obv. 29'), and a man with yellow eyes and \"Hand of curse\" (rev. 31')Portrait; uiltu KAL 4 no. 41 Obverse: a broken symptom description possibly for garbu (obv. 1) and two colophon preserved(Broken, portrait?); Area Text Content Format and designation N4 A 400 Obverse and reverse: an incantation against makadu-illness followed by instructionsLandscape; uiltu N4 no. 237 Obverse and reverse: a prayer ama (obv. 1-13) followed by a rubrick (obv. 14-15) and two prescriptions directed against a ghost seizing a man.

Assuming Kiir -Aur accompanied his father when performing his ipu duties during his amall\u00fb eru-phase, it is plausible that the knowledge Kiir - Aur acquired was for educational reasons with a practical dimension (Maul 2010a: 216).4 I distinguish three groups of texts among Kiir -Aur 's 13 amall\u00fb eru texts based on whether or not they are related to manipulating the body of the patient. These three groups are: 1) prescriptions and rituals with diagnoses intended to cure symptoms and illnesses affecting a patient's body, 2) rituals and prayers directed towards removing bad omens potentially caus - ing illness(?) or soothing the anger of a cause of affliction,5 and 3) texts unre - alted to healing. In the first group we find BAM 9, which comprises numerous diagnoses and prescriptions for headaches (sagkidabb\u00fb) and ghost -induced head conditions 4 Finkel (2000: 147) suggested that, for example, dosage measuring was often neglected in the texts because the correct proportions were taught through demonstration. Rote learning was likely also an integral part of copying texts (Clancier 2014: 45-46; Koch 1995: 139; see Maul 2010a: 215 note 215). 5 The evidence presented here does not agree with the general picture presented by Maul (2010a: 216) regarding the early phase Education amall\u00fb eru on both the obverse and reverse. BAM 129 is one of the few examples of a library copy (multi- columned tablet) among Kiir -Aur 's tablets with colophons. The two obverse columns consist of abracadabra incantations and associated ritu- als intended to cure a patient with sagallu-illness . Column three is completely broken, but column four contains diagnoses and complicated prescriptions treating the associated aau-illness (see Section 3.1). BAM 201 consists of long prescriptions curing an unknown malady, \"Curse\" (mmtu), and \"inability to talk\" (kadabbed\u00fb) and associated symptoms. The unpublished N4 A 400 is a small tablet with a single incantation with accom- panying instructions intended to cure makadu-illness . The manuscript N4 no. 237 contains a prayer to ama and two prescriptions for treating the effects of a ghost. The obverse of RA 15 pl. 76 concerns brief prescriptions for snakebites and scorpion stings, and the reverse contains two prescriptions likely treat - ing a horse. RA 40 pl. 116 comprises prescriptions concerning the illness a\u00fb, paittu-bile, lubu- sweat and various lung problems related to coughs. The broken KAL 4 no. 41 likely treats the skin malady garbu.6 The last example may not have manipulated the patient's body. In the second group we find the broken ritual KAL 4 no. 197 and a uilla- prayer (U .\u00cdL.L\u00c1) to the divine judge Madnu, a divine personification of \"judgement\" related to Marduk.8 Additionally, N4 A 2191 contains a ritual against a ghost, which duplicates an unspecified part of BAM 323 (Daniel Schwemer, personal communication). Kiir -Aur also copied the ritual N4 no. 289 for substituting a patient with a goat kid, which is killed and handed over to Erekigal, the goddess of the netherworld.9 The third group contains the text N4 no. 241 covering words and phrases in Sumerian and Akkadian in individual lines, which are ruled off from one 6 It remains uncertain what the fragment KAL 4 no. 41 treated. Maul reconstructs the first line [umma par - allel in BAM 580 col. v 17'-20' (= AMT 84,4 col. iii 9'-12'), where line NA pi-in-du-\u00fa a ga-ra-bu While the remaining ritual in BAM 580 duplicates KAL 4 no. 41, the context differs. Although the ending is not preserved in the first example, the parallel prescriptions in BAM 580 contain instructions for \"applying\" (L\u00c1) or \"anointing\" (E.ME), whereas KAL 4 no. 41 ends with something being thrown into the river. This action fits the other parallel text, KAR 25 col. iii 13'-20' , which contains a ritual for a uilla-prayer to S\u00een. As a result, KAR 25 makes no mention of garbu in col. iii 13' , although we know that persons suffering from garbu should perform a ritual invoking S\u00een possibly due to a connection to epilepsy (Stol 1993: 128 and note 65; cf. BAM 580 col. v 20). 7 Maul and Strau\u00df (2011: 49) labelled the text as a namburbi-ritual although this remains uncer - tain. See the discussion in Section 3.7. 8 Krebernik 2007: 356. For 1976. 9 See Ch. 3 note 124.40 Chapter 3 another. The specific entries were described collectively as \u00e2tu, a term related to lexical lists 2016: 51-52, 101-103; Frahm 2011a: 48ff.). The copied on behalf of Kiir -Aur . In general, it is surprising that so few of the surviving colophons from the hand of Kiir -Aur date to this early stage of his career, as we would expect a production of library copies during his early phases of specialization.10 Several circumstances may explain this situation, such as the chance of survival, very few of his early tablets were provided with colophons, or such tablets were discarded. Individual tablets are discussed in detail below. 3.1 Complex Diagnoses in Kiir-Aur's amall\u00fb eru Texts The texts generally imply that Kiir -Aur as a amall\u00fb eru learned skills related to healing various physiological areas that have the common trait of being influenced by complex illnesses, which are not solely related to a single, easily defined set of symptoms. In what follows, I briefly discuss the various diagnoses copied by Kiir -Aur as amall\u00fb eru in order to evaluate the dif- ficulties inherent in them. Snakebites and scorpion stings have been excluded from the discussion, although Chapter 4 shows that they were considered to be physiologically complex and intellectually important. A limited number of diagnoses appear among the earliest tablets from the hand of Kiir -Aur , of which Scurlock and Andersen (2005) classify several as \"syndromes\".11 Ghosts (eemmu) could produce everything from head- aches (sagkidabb\u00fb),12 ringing ears, bloated and hurting abdomen, and upper abdominal fevers, to various one -sided pains (ibid.: 312, 525-27). Mmtu likewise does not always represent a clear -cut set of symptoms (Maul 2010a: 135). This syndrome was frequently connected to or used as an overarching cause of illness related to, e.g., cough or colic.13 The associated kadabbed\u00fb (lit.: 10 See Robson 2011a: sagallu, aau (Scurlock See a discussion of sagallu and aau, as well as a definition and discussion of the term \"syndrome\" , in Arb\u00f8ll 2018a. 12 For various types of headaches and migraines labelled sagkidabb\u00fb, see Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 311-12. 13 For mmtu and its cures, see Maul 29-46. For illness sulu, a diagnosis as well as a symptom related to coughs (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 178-79; Cadelli 2000: 313ff.), could turn into ks libbi, a type of colic (see Ch. 9 note 47). A MB letter indicates that a patient with cough (ganu and sulu) was treated for 41 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru 'seizing -of-the -mouth ') was connected to witchcraft and disabled the proper use of one's mouth and speech (CMAwR 2: 398; CMAwR 1: 3-4, The illness a\u00fb designated a skin malady, although it also encompassed internal symptoms (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 74-75, 191, 224; Fincke 2000: 100-3). As such, the illness was not necessarily easily diagnosed. Also a skin ailment, garbu produced a certain type of white lesion called pind\u00fb (KAL 4: 91; cf. Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 231-32). It was furthermore connected to epilepsy, and it has been suggested that it designates leprosy.14 Sagallu and aau were two illnesses affecting the (lower) bodily \"strings\" (ernu), here especially the body's muscles and tendons. The two illnesses may have been part of a syndrome beginning with the condition makadu that could progress into sagallu and ultimately become aau. I have stud- ied these three illnesses in a recent article (Arb\u00f8ll 2018a). These illnesses have traditionally been considered part of the advanced knowledge of the ipu.15 A common trait of these diagnoses is that a majority of them are listed as diagnoses of illnesses in the diagnostic-prognostic series Sa- gig.16 They can therefore be considered complex illness concepts that must have been impor - tant for Kiir -Aur to understand in order to provide the right cure. These ill- nesses can also be considered complex in relation to their symptoms, which inform on the physiological conception of the body. The areas of the body affected by the illnesses in Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts are listed in Table 3. ks libbi and was in danger 2012: 48-49, 500ff.). is worth noting that RA 40 pl. 116 obv. 8 lists sulu as a symptom and the prescriptions on the reverse of RA 15 pl. 76 may refer to some sort of colic, perhaps similar to ks libbi (see below). Whether or not Kiir -Aur copied any of his amall\u00fb eru material with these possible relationships in mind remains uncertain. 14 Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 71, 231-232, 722-724 note SA .GAL SA.GIG GIG ki-sat ... The hypothesis rests on observing the second part (rev. 28-40) of KAR 44 as a more advanced section in relation to the first (obv. 1-rev . 27). See Section 9.4. 16 The associated illness kadabbed\u00fb is not mentioned in the NA version of Sa- gig, although it was in an earlier version (CMAwR 1: 16, 434-443). For the Sa- gig series, see Scurlock 2014: 13-272; 1951. Wee (2012: 186) states that it is not clear if the goal of Sa- gig always was to identify cause over illness.42 Chapter 3 Clearly, these few illnesses cover a large portion of the body. However, the texts only include a limited number of actual symptom descriptions and diagno - ses, a fair amount of \"ditto\" (KI.MIN) prescriptions, and other prescriptions without listing symptoms or diagnoses altogether. In Table 4 is a schematic overview of the types of symptom descriptions and diagnoses in Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts.Table 3 Illnesses and affected areas of the body Bodily area Illness Head (Headache, etc.) sagkidabb\u00fb, Types of illness descriptions in Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts Type of illness description Preserved entries in text DI NA (symptom description with or without illness names, and no RA 40 pl. 116 obv. 21(?)

Other entries simply refer to the name of the illness, presumably because Kiir -Aur already knew (parts of) the illness' manifesta- tions or because his teacher would fill in the gaps during his apprenticeship (see below). I discuss Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru diagnoses in relation to the diagnostic-prognostic series Sa- gig in Section 3.6.1. 3.1.1 Earlier Diagnostic Training To what extent Kiir -Aur was allowed to engage in actual medical treatments as amall\u00fb eru is unknown, but, as I argue in Section 6.2.4, he was probably not allowed to \"practice\" medicine on his own until he was mamau. Thus, he may not have studied diagnoses and physiology in depth before becom- ing a amall\u00fb eru. However, none of Kiir -Aur 's tablets with colophons attest to early -stage educational excerpts with one or two prescriptions.17 To evaluate Kiir -Aur 's prior medical knowledge, Finkel's study of a group of LB school tablets is currently the best comparative material.18 The majority of the material edited by Finkel consists of single prescriptions, incantations, or small plant lists with no direct duplicates in the therapeutic series Ugu (Finkel 2000: 142). Both the LB school texts, as well as the 24 elementary medi- cal exercises from the N4 collection listed by Finkel (ibid.: 143-44), appear to revolve around relatively simple problems, such as headache, fever (ummu),19 or \"Anus illness\" ,20 of which few are attested in Sa- gig.21 17 Although, e.g., LKA 43 only contains one text. Some N4 tablets may derive from an ear - lier education phase. See, e.g., Veldhuis 2014: 369-70; Finkel 2000: 144. In general, the earlier school texts are poorly attested in the NA sources (Veldhuis 2014: 353-72; Gesche 2001: Uruk, see Clancier 2014: 45 note 16, 48 note 35. 18 See Finkel 2000. The tablets belong to the archive of Bl-rmanni. However, Jursa (1999: 1) has stressed that this Bl-rmanni was not part of the scribal elite, and the medical texts in this archive may represent certain specific needs related to this family (ibid.: 28-29). Gesche lists medical texts as part of iptu specialization, and generally not as part of the NB and LB school texts she investigated (Gesche 2001: 172 , 214). BAM 89 obv. 1: DI rev. q\u00e9-reb D\u00daR.GIG; BAM 98 rev. 2: nap-al-ti D\u00daR.GIG. However, a few of the N4 elementary exercises contain more com- plex .UB .BA. 21 See references to D\u00daR.GIG in medical texts in Wee 2012: 226. See Finkel 2000: 203 (text 48), 207 (text 50), 208 (text 51) and 210 (text 52) for more complicated diagnoses.44 Chapter 3 Drawing on Finkel's findings, the earlier knowledge taught to Kiir -Aur likely consisted of symptoms grouped under less complex illness headings. As a result, the complex diagnoses copied by him as amall\u00fb eru stand out and attest to the fact that he was taught iptu: he needed to learn about the over - arching illnesses and causes behind the symptoms. Furthermore, Kiir -Aur 's surviving material suggests that he learned about the nature of such illnesses through the therapeutic texts coupled with oral instructions, as discussed in Sections 3.6 and 3.6.1. Although his amall\u00fb eru texts were not directly related to complex causes of illness, they likely provided prescriptions con- cerning causes that were illustrative for understanding the human anatomy and physiological processes. Aspects of Kiir -Aur 's training in anatomy and physiology are explored in chapter 4. In light of the above evidence, Kiir -Aur appears to have made use of the diagnoses copied as amall\u00fb eru to learn how to establish a complex diagnosis, and to understand (roughly) how the body functioned and how these treatments were believed to work in relation to symptoms and causes. 3.2 Principles Understood through Examples Mesopotamian scholarly disciplines likely relied on lists of omens to pro - vide the written, \"scientific\" background for a principle.22 Omen series, such as Sa-gig, are therefore often regarded as lists of omens used to establish \"theories\".23 But, how would Kiir -Aur have learned the necessary diagnostic principles, if not from Sa- gig? We must assume the Bba- uma-ibni family had an extensive oral dimension to their teachings.24 However, although someone in N4 copied \"questions\" related to Sa- gig,25 it still stands to reason that the majority of the written material for Kiir -Aur 's diagnostic understanding must have been derived from the therapeutic texts.26 22 For discussions with further references, see Rochberg 2016: 140-41; van 104, 110-14. 24 exist from the N4 collection, especially from Kiir -Nab\u00fb, although they do not seem to attest to oral teachings (Frahm 2011a: 268-270). 25 See Ch. 3 note 105. 26 Comparatively, Robson (2013: 49-50) noted that omens account for a small portion of the uzirina texts and describes the situation as follows: \"As its students were not preparing to access the inner circle of the royal court, they had no great need for omens\" (ibid.: 50). However, the court scholars rarely 2008: -Aur 's therapeutic texts copied as amall\u00fb eru provided him with the knowledge necessary for producing and providing a therapeutic treat - ment for the disorders in question (see Section 3.6). While his texts contain some \"ditto\" (KI.MIN) prescriptions, especially on the obverse of RA 15 pl. 76, the majority of entries copied contain at least the name of the illness and a treatment. Finkel's hypothesis that a student would collect (in the KI.MIN format) all the prescriptions that he had learned and copy them onto a large tablet at the end of his studies is therefore not applicable in this context (Finkel 2000: 143). Instead, as shown in the following sections, Kiir -Aur seems to have cop - ied material related to assignments involving a particular physiological area or malady. However, in order to apply this knowledge, he must also have acquired the necessary abilities for understanding human physiology. While a few use - ful lists of anatomy from which an abundance of medical knowledge could originate are known,27 the majority of such knowledge was probably obtained from the principles one could derive from the therapeutic texts with diagnoses and contextualized via the actual praxis of the family. In the following sections, Kiir -Aur 's diagnostic-therapeutic texts from the first category of amall\u00fb eru texts are subjected to a thorough investigation in order to establish what Kiir -Aur may have learned from them and how they were possibly used in his training. 3.3 The Head: BAM 9 BAM 9 relates to headaches (sagkidabb\u00fb; lit.: \"affliction of the temple(s)\"), the temples, ghosts (eemmu), and ringing ears. Headaches and pulsating tem- ples are among the most common symptoms of ghostly disorders, although other symptoms were also considered ominous concerning ghostly diagnoses (Scurlock 2006: 12-18).28 Finally, possibly two entries relate to \"burning tu- fever \" (UD .DA TAB -ma) of the head. In BAM 9, Kiir -Aur writes out the diagnosis \"[If a man]'s [he]ad burns with tu and the hair of his 'head' (muu) falls out, (and) he [(repeatedly?) 27 See the list Ugumu and Ur-ra Ferreira 2009; of Diseases\" , known from Nineveh and Assur, in which a few ana- tomical features are also described in relation to illnesses (MSL 9: 90ff., ms B = VAT 11507). 28 Scurlock 2006; cf. Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 166, 312, 324, 502, 524, 527, 555, 736 note 100.46 Chapter 3 suff]ers ['rising' (strings of his) temple(s)] ...\".29 This line differs in one signifi- cant regard from its four duplicates, namely in the writing of SAG .DU-\u00fa in ref- erence to the -Aur writes muiu his head)\" (Worthington 19).31 However, the other .DU-\u00fa). According to Westenholz and Sigrist the first subseries of Ugu con- tains a distinction between the use of qaqqadu and muu. The former desig - nates the cutaneous layer around the skull, i.e., the outside of the head and its skin, whereas the latter designated the skull and brain, i.e., a bony structure with marrow (= the brain).32 Since the relevant passage in BAM 9 is duplicated by another Assur manu- script, BAM 3, which has the writing SAG .DU over UGU , BAM 9 does not seem to have been a varying tradition. Instead, it must be regarded as an idiosyn- crasy on behalf of Kiir -Aur , who either made the mistake when copying, or because he did not recall the difference between the terms anatomically (cf. Worthington 2012: 112). If Kiir -Aur copied from a writing -board containing a version parallel to Nineveh Ugu, then muu would have been the subject until this prescription, in which the focus changed to qaqqadu (cf. Westenholz and Sigrist 2006: 4). A third possibility is that he consciously wrote this sign, as (tu-)fevers may have been able to reside within the bones, i.e., the marrow or brain(?).33 29 BAM SAR ... [ ] Edition in Worthington 2005: 11 line 141'-42' and p. 2 7 for comments on these lines. 30 Furthermore, this line contains an erasure and possibly only one TUKU sign to denote the Gtn stem. See Ch. 3 note 29. 31 In the edition of the 1st tablet (Worthington 2005) and the 2nd tablet (Attia and Buisson 2003) of the first subsection of Ugu the opening incipit has been translated as \"If a de la chaleur\" , although Geller at one point advocated a translation as \"If a man's brain contains heat (fever)\" (Geller 2001-02: 58, 68; cf. Westenholz and Sigrist 2006: 4). 32 The OB lexical list Ugumu lists body parts in Sumerian, in which we find a range of words related to the head in Sumerian (Couto Ferreira 2009; Westenholz and Sigrist 2008). 33 This is perhaps indicated in several diagnoses concerning (imi) tu, e.g., BAM 145 obv. 11-12: \"... the flesh above is cold (but) his bone below (feels) burning hot ...\" (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 53). See the NA royal letter SAA 10 no. 242: \"... this fever has lingered inside the very bones\" (obv. 10-12: ina \u00c0 a u-un-u 11 u-\u00fa e-ma-a-ti 12 \u00fa-kil-lu-u-ni). See 47 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru BAM 9 is an extract (nisu), and all the entries are extracted according to uncertain principles from the first tablets of the 1st subseries of the therapeu- tic Ugu series, as shown in Table 20 in Section 9.3.4.34 The entries duplicated in the Ugu tablets were chosen from sections concerning the qaqqadu and not the muu.35 The choice of entries for BAM 9 may therefore have been based on their relation to physical symptoms occurring mainly on the outside of the head (i.e., not the internal brain-area). Perhaps the extracts were chosen according to instructions or maybe they were arranged as such on the writing - board from which Kiir -Aur copied. In two instances in BAM 9, Kiir -Aur writes a dual of the cuneiform sign for eye (IGIII) where the specification relates to the \"right\" or \"left\" eye.36 Although this is not necessarily uncommon, it is not attested in the parallel Nineveh library copy BAM 482.37 However, this was likely a scribal convention rather than anatomical unawareness (see, e.g., BAM 202 rev. 7' , KAR 298 rev. 30). The catch-line of BAM 9 is preserved in two Assur duplicates and states: \"[If] tu-fever burns [a man] so that the hair of his head continually stands on also BAM 575 col. i 21 (2nd tablet of the sulu ill in the 'abdo - men' , the inside of his bone(s) is yellow, his belly is covered with 'sores' (simmu), he is overcome by tu (Cadelli 2000: 125). As a result, fevers such as tu may occasionally have been related to the marrow and, by extension, the brain. Cf. Stol 2007a: 12, 22, 25, 27 with examples. 34 BAM 9 contain duplicate passages of lines 141'-146' and 148' from BAM 480 = 1st tablet (Worthington 2005 ms A) and lines 7-9, 67-67, 68-69, 84-89 and 169'-176' of BAM 482 = tablet (Attia and Buisson 2003 ms A). 35 Westenholz and Sigrist (2006: 4) noted that lines 1-140' and 190'-197' in BAM 480 (Worthington 2005) concerned the muu, whereas lines 141'-189' and 206'- end 2003: 6 line 84 and 86. 37 A few differences, however, suggest that BAM 9 was copied from a tradition varying from the Nineveh traditions. The diagnosis in BAM 9 obv. 35 is broken, but two duplicates have DI KI.MIN and two have DI NA SAG .KI.DAB .BA TUKU.TUKU-i (Attia and Buisson 2003: 3 line 7). Neither line fits the BAM 9 entry. Furthermore, BAM 9 obv. 4 and another manuscript share an order of two drugs, [imG\u00daR].G\u00daR ... imLI, which are reversed in three other duplicates, e.g., the Nineveh library copy BAM 482 (ibid.: 8 line 171'). BAM 9 also formulates the diagnosis in obv. 18 differently than in BAM 482 (ibid: 6 line 88). 48 Chapter 3 end\".38 This diagnosis and its symptoms are known to have affected various bodily areas, and we must assume that Kiir -Aur was supposed to move on to other illnesses or areas of the body after copying BAM 9. 3.3.1 Treating Ghostly Afflictions The unpublished manuscript N4 no. 237 contains a prayer to ama and two prescriptions for treating a man seized by a ghost.39 The content is therefore directed against similar problems as some prescriptions in BAM 9. However, there are no symptom descriptions in N4 no. 237 and only a single preserved diagnosis (rev. 4: DI NA GIDIM DAB-su; cf. obv. 14-15). Presumably, all the treatments in N4 no. 237 were directed against this problem. The tablet men- tions two ritual elements, which Kiir -Aur could have learned in connection to this text. Obverse lines 20-21 mention: \"You draw the line [... in diviner\" (iddu [... kma ]a br\u00ee taaddad), referring to an act of ritually marking an offering arrangement apart from the environment, and obverse line 22 states: \"You distribute small heap(s) of flour\" ([zid]ubdubb\u00e2 tattanaddi).40 The final prescription contains at least three notations of a \"new break\" in slightly smaller script, indicating that the original copied from contained a number of breaks (see Sections 3.4.1 and 7.4.3 for further discussion of such statements). This treatment is also preserved in Kiir -Aur 's BAM 9, Kiir - Nab\u00fb's KAR 56 from his mamau-phase,41 as well as a manuscript from contemporary Nineveh (AMT 93,1; see Scurlock 2006: 607 no. 290). The pre - scription is presented in partitur below with a composite the illness, see, e.g., Stol 2007a: 28-29; Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 53 no. 3.121. The colophon of BAM 145 is broken, but on the picture on CDLI (P285241) the middle of rev. 7 may read: b\u00e0-r\u00ec. The end of rev. 9 may read: \u00c1MAN!?.L\u00c1 [TUR(?)], but this requires further collation. See Ch. 5 note 57. 39 The partly damaged initial prescription (obv. 16-rev . 3) presumably described actions accompanying the no. 237 and Schwemer 2011: 138, 145, 148 with further references. Note that N4 no. 237 is the only of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts mentioning \"flour heap(s)\" zidubdubb\u00fb, whereas BAM 129 col. i 27 and 31 is the only of his text from this phase mentioning a \"magical flour circle\" zisurr\u00fb. 41 Edited, except for the Scurlock 5-11).49 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru 237 rev. 4: DI NA GIDIM DAB-su \u00fa-ra-an-na a ghost afflicts (lit.: seizes) a man, you char and mix (list of ingredients).

The edition above shows that KAR 56 also contained notations of a \"new break\" in smaller script in almost the exact same lines as N4 no. 237.42 Furthermore, both these manuscripts contain identical spellings and writings of the pre - scriptions. The only difference is the addition of the comment \"new break\" in N4 no. 237 reverse line 6. Comparatively, the two additional duplicate pas - sages in BAM 9 and AMT 93,1 contain different spellings and added ingredients in the passages where N4 no. 237 and KAR 56 noted breaks in the original.43 Accordingly, these manuscripts differ, although they do not appear to repre - sent a single divergent tradition.44 N4 no. 237 contains passages also consid- ered useful to Kiir -Nab\u00fb, and the knowledge was therefore employed in N4 at various career stages. Furthermore, the text was labelled as an uiltu-tablet, which could indicate the purpose behind the text was different from other amall\u00fb eru manuscripts labelled as uppus (see Section 5.3.2). The prescription above is not the only duplicate passage in N4 no. 237 and KAR 57. The three opening lines of the initial prayer in N4 no. 237 are paral- lel to KAR 56 obverse lines 12-14, although the remaining spell and the fol- lowing ritual instruction in KAR 56 differ from the prayer and the following prescription in N4 no. 237.45 KAR 56 also contains two additional entries not incorporated into N4 no. 237 (KAR 56 obv. 1-4, rev. 11-13). The colophon of KAR 56 reads: \"(Catch-line), a copy of an Assyrian writing -board, for under - taking a (ritual) procedure of Kiir -Nab\u00fb, the mamau- exorcist, he [qu]ickly extracted (it)\".46 As discussed in Section 9.2.1, KAR 56 was presumably copied 42 N4 no. 237 rev. 7/KAR 56 obv. 237 rev. 10(?)/KAR 56 obv. 10. 43 E.g., N4 no. 237 rev. 7 vs. BAM 9 rev. 48; N4 no. 237 rev. 8 vs. BAM 9 rev. 48; N4 no. 237 rev. 8 vs. BAM 9 rev. 49; N4 no. 237 rev. 10 vs. BAM 9 rev. 49. 44 BAM 9 and AMT 93,1 do not agree on various spellings, see e.g., BAM 9 rev. 48 vs. AMT 93,1 obv.? 3' and BAM 9 rev. 50 vs. AMT 93,1 obv.? 4'. Other spellings in the two manuscripts are identical, although they differ from N4 no. 237 and KAR 56, see e.g., BAM 9 rev. 49 vs. AMT 93,1 obv.? 3'. BAM 9 and AMT 93,1 contain the same added ingredients in the \"breaks\" lu-u 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru from a writing board with Assyrian sign forms.47 Comparatively, N4 no. 237 is only \"copied and checked according to its original\".48 Considering the numer - ous notes on breaks in identical places in N4 no. 237 and KAR 56, it is pos - sible that the prescription was copied by Kiir -Aur and later Kiir -Nab\u00fb from the same partly broken writing -board. The added note on a \"new break\" in N4 no. 237 rev. 6, which is not found in KAR 56, or filled out with an ingredient in the two additional duplicate manuscripts, indicates that Kiir -Aur saw a bro - ken space on the writing -board copied from, which had originally not listed an ingredient. Kiir -Nab\u00fb may have realized this when producing his copy since the note was not added to his manuscript. This indicates that Kiir -Aur was an inexperienced copyist when he produced N4 no. 237, which is substantiated by a peculiar writing of his father's name as Nab\u00fb-bssuni in the colophon (N4 no. 2 rev. 15: BAM 9 was a \"first extract\" and a \"copy of a writing -board\" , which may have been further described in a broken passage (Section 9.2.1). Thus, it is possible to pose two hypotheses concerning this text in relation to N4 no. 237. Possibly, BAM 9 was copied from the same writing -board as N4 no. 237 and KAR 56, but the text served another purpose than the former.49 Thus, broken spaces could have been filled and different spellings employed. Alternatively, BAM 9 was copied from another writing -board with a different text. 3.4 The \"Strings\" and \"Inner\" Body Four of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts attest to him learning about the mouth, lungs, abdomen, and \"strings\" (i.e., muscles, tendons, arteries, veins, etc.) of the body via the illnesses sagallu-aau (BAM 129), mmtu and kad and a\u00fb, paittu, lubu, as well as various lung illnesses (RA 40 pl. 116). BAM 129, BAM 201 and RA 40 pl. 116 are discussed individually here to provide a discussion of their content in relation to Kiir -Aur 's training. The manuscript N4 A 400 is still unpublished, and only a single general observation can be made. The text is likely the only tablet among Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase manuscripts, which contain a single incantation and instructions for treating a concrete illness. 47 Whether or not the Assyrianism i-bal-la-ma, instead of the expected Babylonian iballu in KAR 56 rev. 9, can be attributed to the writing -board or Kiir -Nab\u00fb's idiosyncracies is uncertain. 48 .BI.GIM AB .SAR BA.AN .\u00c8. 49 Additionally, BAM 9 was labelled a uppu and N4 no. 237 an uiltu. The latter types may have served different purposes, see Section 5.3.2.52 Chapter 3 3.4.1 BAM 129 BAM 129 has a preserved first and fourth column, only the beginning lines are preserved in column two, and none of column three survives. The two columns on the obverse consist of abracadabra incantations and ritual instructions against sagallu,50 but without diagnoses, whereas column four contains diag - noses and elaborate prescriptions for treating aau. Presumably, column three also contained cures for this illness. Unlike bilingual and monolingual Akkadian incantations, it is unclear if abracadabra incantations had any place in LB scribal education, and their appearance in the amall\u00fb eru manuscript BAM 129 is therefore peculiar.51 Kiir -Aur included three annotations in spaces left blank in the first col- umn of BAM 129, noting that the tablet copied from contained a \"new break\".52 In two of these examples the presumed correct reading of the line is known: BAM 129 col. i 8: [D\u00d9.D\u00d9.B]I \u00fa ta pa e-p\u00ed e-\u00fa ina dugLA.A.AN CT 23 pl. 6 col. ii 9'-11': [... ] TI-q\u00e9-\u00fa-ma ana IGI 20 10 [...

However, sagallu-illness may occasionally have been treated with abracadabra incantations, such as the ones found in BAM 129. 52 See BAM 129 col. i 8, 10, 31: e-p\u00ed e-\u00fa. No breaks are noted in col. iv.53 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru The ritual in BAM 129 col. i 8-11 is difficult to understand, even in the pre - served Nineveh versions. The internal evidence suggests that Kiir -Aur may have understood even less. In addition to the \"new break\" in col. i 8, the beginning of the line is broken and leaves room for no more than five recon- structed signs. This amount of space does not fit any of the duplicate versions. The break must therefore be reconstructed with another \"new break\" note, an unknown line from a different tradition, or represent a mistake in Kiir -Aur 's copy. Notably, Kiir -Aur makes at least one mistake in this passage, copying giGIM for giBAN. Due to the similarity of the two signs, Kiir -Aur possibly mistook BAN for GIM.53 Finkel has argued that the e-p\u00ed glosses among his group of LB exercises may be an attempt by the writer to show his ability to faithfully preserve and trans - mit an older, fragmentary text (Finkel 2000: 180; cf. Worthington 2012: 26-27). Considering that the production of tablets to be integrated into the family's tablet collection seems to have been one of the goals of aspiring scholars,54 BAM 129 may be an example of Kiir -Aur showing his ability to copy a dif- ficult and fragmentary tablet. Therefore, the copy here could be an exercise. Nevertheless, several passages in the treatments prescribe ritualistic acts, which Kiir -Aur perhaps copied in order to aid his father. The same conclu- sions may hold true for N4 no. 237 above. Peculiarly, Kiir -Aur did not copy any of the numerous makadu- or arai- themed incantations and rituals often prescribed against sagallu.55 Unlike the entries chosen for BAM 9, the duplicate passages of BAM 129 run consecutively on the Nineveh (Ugu?) manuscript CT 23 pl. 5-14, which included all such incantations and ritual instructions (Section 9.3.4). 53 BAM 129 col. i 10. Worthington (2012: 93-98) classified such errors as \"errors of sign iden- tification\" (see a similar example in Hee\u00dfel 2000: 306 note 30). 54 Memorization through repeated copying was an integral part of cuneiform train- ing (Robson 2011a: 562-63). For Manuscripts from amall\u00fb erus, such as K. 2016a+, also excavated collection (Veldhuis 2014: 384-85; Lieberman 1990: 215-16). Many apprentices left behind few tablets in the N4 collection, perhaps to commemorate their time in the house (Maul 2010a: 215 and note 93; see Fadhil 2012: 34, 51). Comparatively, the LB text produc- tion was generally related to learning and teaching (Clancier 2014: 45-46, 50, 52; George 2003-04: 404). Several NB and LB examples exist of educational tablets donated to tem- ple libraries, see Gesche 55 CT 23 pl. 4 BAM 201 The five preserved prescriptions on BAM 201 mainly concern mmtu and kadabbed\u00fb causing fever and swollen insides,56 throwing up saliva with blood and pus,57 and having yellow eyes.58 None of the diagnoses or pre - scriptions has any direct duplicate, but all of the long prescriptions seem to contain one step in the treatment wherein the patient is bandaged with a cloth (T\u00daG).59 The combination of clearly internal illnesses and mainly external applications suggests these were the factors behind the arrangement. Of note, the tablet provides an alternative treatment method for the final application on the reverse, which is unusual in Kiir -Aur 's copies.60 Additionally, almost all prescriptions on this tablet are quite long. The catch- line is also peculiar, as it does not spell out the following diagnosis, but simply 56 Obv. man's insides continually swollen and there is a hot fever, his(?) [...] is swollen (and) his inside (are) constricted, his fee[t] are raised [...]; that man (suffers from) 'Hand of Curse (or) kadabbed\u00fb\" (cf. Maul 2019: [...], and he [continually throws] up blood and pus with his saliva\" (see a man]'s eyes are full of yellow, that man (is ill from) 'Hand of Curse\". Maul BABBAR NA BI U NAM .\u00c9RIM, and states that the dual of IGI is not visible on the original tablet. However, there is at least one vertical wedge at the end of the partly visible IGI, which does not belong to this sign or -\u00fa. Regarding the reading DIRI-ut over SA BABBAR, see onlines. K\u00f6cher's copy reads: ... U NAM .\u00c9RIM. If we follow the Sa- gig principle, this could designate mmtu as \"Krankheitsverursacher\" and not only \"Krankheitsname\" , which would be the only such example among Kiir -Aur 's texts (see Hee\u00dfel 2000: 50). However, the tablet may con- tain the remains of a damaged /MA/ on the side, which could negate this observation. It remains uncertain. 59 BAM 201 2019: Note the new of er\u00fb (SUR) in CAD (: 103-4) as \"to extract, squeeze or press out liquid (via a piece of leather, cloth)\" over the previous translation \"to rub into\" (CDA : 414; AHw: 1388-89). Regardless, the patient must have been bandaged with the mentioned piece of leather or cloth. 60 BAM 201 rev. 40'-41': as amall\u00fb -Aur writes A for \u00c0S, rare in Kiir -Aur 's colophons.62 The colophon specifies that the content was extracted from \"a writing -board of prescriptions from the Gula temple\".63 The tablet is labelled as an uiltu- tablet, which perhaps designates a commitment or an obligation inherent in the purpose for copying the text.64 As this tablet was different from the others copied by Kiir -Aur as amall\u00fb eru, I would argue that the uiltu label here must designate some sort of exercise Kiir -Aur was obligated to make. In this case, it is not inconceivable that Kiir -Aur was tasked with finding mmtu treatments, which also included bandages. 3.4.3 RA 40 pl. 116 RA 40 pl. 116 consists of six prescriptions on the obverse. As noted by its editors Labat and Tournay (1945-46: 113), the first diagnosis concerning a\u00fb, paittu, and lubu illnesses is roughly duplicated in the 3rd tablet (BAM 578) of the sulu subsection of the Nineveh Ugu series that deals specifically with bile affecting the chest and epigastrium with or without fever (ummu) as well as jaundice (see Section 9.3.4).65 The remaining five prescriptions and four diag - noses have no direct parallels, however, and appear to concern illnesses of the airways.66 The opening diagnosis, mentioning the names of a\u00fb, paittu, and 61 other instance is BAM 28 rev. 17': ... na-\u00e0s-a. According to Borger (2003: 245), this reading was rare. 63 See Maul 2010: 213-214 and the discussion in Section 9.5.1; BAM 116 obv. 1: [DI] NA a-\u00e1-a pa-it-t\u00fa u lu-ba-i a-\u00e1-a pa-it-t\u00fa u lu-[ba-i GIG [... Labat read obv. 2: tuballala[l] and Cadelli (2000: 195 note 25) notes this must be E, albeit the reading is odd as obv. 17 has E.E. I would argue that the picture on CDLI looks more like L\u00c1L! for aqlu \"to weigh out\" , which could also fit the context. 66 RA 40 pl. 116 obv. 8-9: \"If a person is sick with wheezing sulu (barking -coughs) so that his windpipe (trachea and/or bronchi) is full of wind, he coughs (and) coughs (and) has phlegm ...\" (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 48 no. 3.98).56 Chapter 3 lubu, suggests that Kiir -Aur previously may have copied material related to these illnesses with more thorough symptom descriptions. Interestingly, Kiir -Aur wrote the a\u00fb-plant in obv. 19 as \u00faAR.ME. Such a writing is unique, and Labat and Tournay (1945-46: 121) suggested that this was likely a graphic writing of a\u00fb, the word for this plant and for \"lungs\". Since Kiir -Aur had just copied two prescriptions concerning the \"lungs\" , written MUR.ME (MUR being identical to AR) he likely made an \"error of attraction\" and wrote \"plant (for) the lungs\" (cf. Worthington 2012: 109).67 Certain illnesses could affect the stomach and induce vomit. One such afflic- tion was paittu, fluid in the gastro -intestinal system.68 Vomiting could be considered a symptom of imbalance within the body or be induced in order to expel the problem, which was the case in two instances in RA 40 pl. 116, for expelling paittu-bile and phlegm.69 As shown below in Chapter 4, this text and RA 15 pl. 76 likely enhanced Kiir -Aur 's knowledge about internal physiology, and also improved his skills for removing cer - tain internal maladies by inducing vomit and using the nostrils to introduce medication. 3.5 Snakes, Scorpions and Horses: A Discussion of RA 15 pl. 76 The text published by Scheil in RA 15 on pl. 76 does not have a museum num- ber. Consequently, the original cannot be consulted and one must rely on his problematic copy (see Appendix 2 with a new edition). The tablet consists of a number of one -line prescriptions against snakebites and scorpion stings on the obverse, and at least two longer prescriptions designed for horse ailments on the reverse (Stol 2011: 400-402). 3.5.1 Snakes and Scorpions: The Obverse While incantations for stings and bites seem to be relatively well attested in the OB corpus,70 Finkel stresses that \"prescriptions for bites and stings by and 67 Note that the pharmacological text BAM 1 lists several plants with various names, which are listed as \u00da MUR.ME, i.e., \"a plant for the lungs\" (Attia and Buisson 2012: 27 lines ms B1 col. ii 21-26). 68 For this type of bile, see Section 4.1.3. 69 RA 40 pl. obv. 8-12. Cf. BAM 201 obv. 5.1 (accessed 23/01/2017); George 2016: 98-118. The earliest incantations against scorpions and snakes were found in ED III Ebla and Fara (Krebernik 1984; Finkel 1999: 213 note 2 further references). 57 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru large did not enter the traditional corpus of therapeutic medical texts\".71 The effects of snake and scorpion venom are, however, well attested in incanta- tions in which venom became a metaphor for various illnesses.72 The relatively few snake and scorpion treatments known from the first millennium primarily originate from the N4 collection and various works concerning plants.73 The prescriptions on the obverse of RA 15 pl. 76 consist mainly of so -called \"simples\" , i.e., prescriptions comprising a single ingredient.74 Presumably, the first diagnosis states: \"If a snake bit a man\" ,75 and obverse line 14 changes the subject with the diagnosis: \"If a scorpion stung a man\".76 RA 15 pl. 76 obv. 1'-6' is duplicated in the final section of BAM 42 (rev. 63-67). BAM 42 was writ - ten during an unknown stage by Aur -kin- umi, likely a contemporary of Kiir -Aur in the N4 collection (Maul 2010a: 216 note 101). According to Finkel (2000: 213 note 3), the snake treatments were added at the end in a smaller hand as an \"afterthought\". While this may be the case, it is noteworthy that the preceding treatments were directed against breathing illnesses (K\u00f6cher 1963a: XVII). The inclusion of snakebite treatments in BAM 42 could therefore be based on a symptomatic relationship between snake venom and such symp - toms (see Section 4.1.2). Peculiarly, several duplicate passages end with the present verbal form ina-e in RA 15 pl. 76 and the stative form n\u00e9-e in BAM 42, both derived from the verb \"to live, stay alive, recover\" n\u00eau, suggesting that the two texts were not copied from the same original or that individual choice was involved (cf. CAD N/2: 197). Moreover, RA 15 pl. 76 obverse lines 8'-10' is found in parallel passages in the plant list CT 14 pl. 23. The parallel passages all make use of a \"wad of reeds\" (i-mu-\u00fa) applied to the bite, and they describe the \"bandaging\" 71 Finkel 1999: 213 and note 3. Finkel, however, noted that such treatments were considered as part of iptu, cf. snake bite, to cure a scorpion (sting) ...\". For a discussion of prescriptions against snakebites in medical texts, see Steinert 2018d: 249-250. 72 E.g., B\u00f6ck 2007: 290 line 155 (= ms j col. iv 14) in an incantation concerning makadu: \"It took half the venom of the snake; it took half the venom of the 1986, N4 no. 605 and no. 277), RA 15 pl. 76 obv. 1'-25'. Plant lists mentioning bites and stings include ammu 153-54. Note also KAR 181 (N4 no. 96), which contains incantations and rituals against scorpions, snakes, and dogs (Steinert 2018d: 250). 74 For the concept of \"simples\" in Babylonian medicine, see Geller 2005: 4. 75 RA 15 pl. 76 obv. 1' [x x x x x x x x x x x x -l]u?

Although these texts are not exact duplicates, they contain parallel entries with similar problems, plants, and how the drugs are to be administered. Such a correlation seems unexpected.78 3.5.2 Horse Colic: The Reverse The reverse of RA 15 pl. 76 contains two prescriptions presumably intended for horses (Stol 2011: 400-402). Horses were important animals in the NA period (ibid.: 386). In addition to the corpus of Hippiatric texts from 13th century Ugarit,79 treatments for horses are primarily known from the NA manuscripts RA 15 pl. 76, BAM 159, BAM 309, and some plant lists.80 Such treatments were transmitted together with human treatments, although several of the prescrip - tions utilize plants and treatments exclusively attested in these contexts (ibid.: 392). Additionally, they typically are not considered part of the normal sphere of healing knowledge.81 As a result, Scurlock suggested that the horse treat - ments in BAM 159 were inserted due to a thematic parallel in referring to the nostril (naru).82 The reverse of RA 15 pl. 76 is fragmentary and poorly copied, but it refers to pouring liquid into the left \"nostril\" (naru) in two instances (rev. 4' , 7') mentions \"horse\" in reverse line 8' (Stol 2011: 401). Administering ingredients into the irrational left nostril is only attested in veterinarian praxis, which indicates that both these prescriptions relate to horses (ibid.: 392). Unfortunately, the illness described in reverse line 8' remains unclear.83 RA 15 pl. 76 also has a peculiar and previously unknown catch-line, which may read: \"If a man's! stomach rises (to vomit) and settles!, (and) his stomach (after 77 The im\u00fb- wad is mainly attested in these two texts (cf. CAD : 193-94). 78 Some entries show slight changes; cf. RA 15 pl. 76 obv. 6 partly duplicated in BAM 42 rev. 68 and CT 14 pl. 23 obv. 9; RA 15 pl. 76 obv. 11' duplicated in CT 14 pl. 23 obv. 11. 79 Cohen and Sivan 1983; see Stol 2011: 386 note 171 for additional references. 80 BAM 159 was also excavated in N4, although it was written by one Bl-apkal-ilni from outside Stol 2011: 386-402). 81 However, such prescriptions were part of written knowledge early on. See the prescrip - tion for a calf from Ebla in recent discussion and edition of BAM 159 in Parys 2014. The relevant sections can be found in BAM 159 col. v 33-36 (potion through the left nostril) and col. v 37-47 (enema). See also Cohen 1983. 83 Rev. 8': [a?]-na ANE!.KUR.RA a bu i DAB -su SIG-iq, \"It is good [f]or a horse that is seized (by) bu i\". See the discussion of this sentence in Appendix 2 and Stol 2011: 401 and note 254. 59 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru having) settled rises(?) (again)\".84 Considering the two previous prescrip - tions dealt with horses, the catch-line likely reflects a continuation of symp - toms that indicate a relationship with colic and the stomach. The content of the horse prescriptions are discussed in detail in relation to physiology in Section 4.4.3. Comparatively, two prescriptions in BAM 159 deal with horse colic, of which the first was likely a prescription designed for horses, although the second may have been a human prescription applied to horses (Stol 2011: 387, 393-95). \"abdomen, belly\" in BAM 159. Colic is the most common horse illness, and it is also attested in the pastoral god akkan (ibid.: 397-98). In horses, colic can have many causes and it is defined as a digestive disease causing abdominal pain.85 Due to the horse's animalistic nature, ks libbi is a more complicated affair in humans, as there is slight evidence that it may also have had a psycho - logical dimension that manifests as an emotional disturbance.86 The above evidence suggests that RA 15 pl. 76 may not be as extraordinary as has typically been assumed. In the so -called \"Assur Medical Catalogue\" , here - after referred to as the AMC (see Section 9.3.2), bites and stings as well as vet - erinarian knowledge are listed after works known to have been included in the Nineveh Ugu series. Their titles in the AMC could indicate that such knowledge was considered to be as important as human healing to the medical traditions in Assur.87 However, it is unknown if application methods or other associative factors had created clusters of prescriptions that were transmitted in the medi- cal tradition (cf. Geller 2010: 97-108). 84 RA 15 - netic initial a- is attested in imperatives and second person singular forms, mainly from OB examples (CAD E: 116). The spelling cannot be explained here, but I fail to see other interpretations. For further discussion of this line, see Appendix 2 and Scheil 1918: 77, 79. 85 Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2002. 86 Cadelli (2000: 363 and note 457) quotes a dream omen wherein ks libbi is given as an opposite to \"joy\" d libbi (see CAD K: 433b; possibly also AbB 1 no. 36 obv. 17). This prob - ably stemmed from the fact that emotions were linked to the heart (\u00c0 ) and by extension the a purely med- ical context. For the gastro -intestinal system, it may also have been related in some way to bile. B\u00f6ck (2014a: 121-128) has suggested that bile regulated the intestinal fluids. Interestingly, \"heart -break\" p libbi was translated as \"panic\" by Stol (1993: 27-31) and he relates this to melancholy and bile. However, ks libbi should probably be considered distinct from p libbi. 87 AMC lines 76-78: GU.M[E]. See also Panayotov 2018b: 91. 60 Chapter 3 The common theme of RA 15 pl. 76 seems to be animals influencing other individuals or being influenced. However, a tentative suggestion could be that the stings/bites and affected horses were connected, as animals in the fields were likely more susceptible to being stung or bitten.88 Thematically, it there - fore describes venomous animals as disease agents with either humans or domestic animals as victims or patients. Apart from being an introduction to these different genres of healing literature, RA 15 pl. 76 likely initiated Kiir - Aur into the anatomical conceptions lying latent in the cuneiform medical literature. At least one OB incantation could be applied to humans and ani- mals alike, and Stol argues that the second horse treatment in BAM 159 was originally designed for humans.89 By extension, the veterinarian material could perhaps be utilized by students to understand some aspects of human anatomy.90 This was also the case in several instances in the history of Greek and Roman medicine (see Mattern 2013: 145-55, 158-60, 163; 128, 132, 214-15, 231-32). 3.6 Gaining an Understanding of Anatomy and Physiology As previously discussed, Kiir -Aur , and his teacher(s), likely drew on the healing texts copied as amall\u00fb eru to widen his diagnostic and anatomi- cal understanding. But while anatomical conceptions in the ancient sources (e.g., Steinert 1967), as well as descriptions of anatomical terms in specific corpuses (e.g., Hee\u00dfel 2000: 25, 28-29; B\u00f6ck 2001),91 have been the 88 See Section 4.2.2. Scorpions are occasionally compared to angry bulls (see the Ur III incantation in Finkel 1999: 234, text 10; the OB incantation RA 88 pl. 161 obv. 1-2; see also George 2016: 102-4; SEAL text 5.1.19.4 ((accessed 23/01/2017)). This comparison could orig - inate in the observation of a bull's reaction after being stung. Note that the first Ugaritic prescription for horses edited by Cohen and Sivan (1983: 9-10, 13 line 2) utilizes the ingre - translated as a \" scorpion-like and 2018: 720-722 line 217, 726). Horse sweat is also used in a prescription as a metaphoric ingredient in a prescription for use on humans (Scurlock 2014: 412), and bull saliva was used in RA 15 pl. 76 against a scorpion sting (see Appendix 2). For a livestock remedy amid human remedies, see George 2016: 132-34. 90 If Steinert's suggestion that the Mesopotamian healers visualized the human body as a container filled with fluids can be generalized, one could imagine animals were occasion- ally visualized similarly (Steinert 2016: Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru subject of individual studies, it has also been pointed out on occasion that some Mesopotamian anatomical descriptions do not always appear coherent or specific.92 One particular problem seems to be the descriptions of internal areas and organs of the torso.93 Autopsy was to the best of our knowledge not performed on the human body.94 As a result, the internal processes were formulated in a tradition that combined observable external symptoms with anatomi- cal features observed in animals and possibly human war casualties (see Section 4.4.1). Therefore, many blank holes had to be filled in order to produce even a rough understanding of how the insides functioned.95 As hypothesized in Section 3.1.1, the material copied in Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru tablets attests to a wide range of bodily areas and was possibly used to achieve an associated understanding of the bodily processes through the writ - ten diagnoses. Considering that BAM 9 was described as a \"first extract\" from either one or several writing -boards and RA 15 pl. 76 was the \"32nd? extract\" , it is possible that BAM 129 and RA 40 pl. 116 also once contained a phrase that designated them as extracts.96 Although this remains uncertain, Kiir -Aur likely copied 31 extracts before RA 15 pl. 76, and, if so, it stands to reason that he copied these as amall\u00fb eru.97 Additionally, BAM 9, RA 15 pl. 76, and RA 40 pl. 116 contain two general types of protective phrases, namely \"you must not erase my written name\" and \"he who takes (the tablet) away, let Nab\u00fb order his disappearance\" or \"let was perhaps occasionally the case among the ancient Greek sources as well (Nutton 2004: 77; see cf. Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 43, 117, 135, 416-17. 95 The enhanced focus on four organs in attributing illnesses to body parts in the LB SpTU I no. 43 may have been related Hee\u00dfel 2008a). 96 However, BAM 129 may have been intended to function as a library copy. This remains unclear. 97 As argued in Section 9.2.3, RA 15 pl. 76 likely represented one of the later extracts in this sequence. For a discussion of Kiir -Aur 's numbered extracts, see Section 9.2. [...]x x x x x -\u00fa-m[a ...] RA 15 pl. 76 Rev. Z\u00c0-\u00fa liq-b[i] Beside these texts, similar statements are found at the end of colophons in BAM 131, Beckman and Foster 1988 no. 21, KAL 10 no. 4, LKA 77 and N4 no. 175. Possibly, Kiir -Aur 62 Chapter 3 BAM 9, BAM 201, and RA 15 pl. 76 also explain what originals Kiir -Aur copied from, and in all three cases this was a writing -board. BAM 201 even adds that it was copied from \"a writing -board of prescriptions from the Gula temple\" , which was likely located in Assur (see Section 9.5.2). This suggests that Kiir -Aur drew his medical amall\u00fb eru material from one or several writing -boards , perhaps all of which were located in a library in the temple dedicated to the goddess of healing. Unfortunately, little is known about the Gula temple in Assur, its library, and whether or not Kiir -Aur received any education there (cf. Wiggermann 2008). Additionally, the unpublished text N4 A 2191 was perhaps copied from a tablet by a certain [...]-Marduk, an as\u00fb from the land of [...].99 This evidence could tentatively be interpreted as an indication that Kiir - Aur was made to copy out the pertinent parts of a writing -board, which contained a text relevant for education and practice, in order to learn (and discuss) the passages required to educate him in the subjects described. This education also included physiological conceptions. This is supported by the general evaluation of the Bba- uma-ibni family's numbered extracts inves - tigated in Section 9.2. Preliminarily, Kiir -Aur copied out an idiosyncratic handbook, which consisted of a number of relevant extracts (nisu), and these adhered to his family's school of thought and his own education. 3.6.1 Kiir-Aur's Diagnostic Training and Sa-gig Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts show relatively few complex diagnoses affect - ing several bodily areas, and they are probably extracted from one or more col- lections of therapeutic texts possibly arranged from head-to -toe according to specific bodily areas (BAM 9, BAM 129, RA 40 pl. 116). Additionally, Kiir -Aur copied at least one exercise(?) according to a malady that affected several bodily areas (mmtu in BAM 201; ghost in N4 no. 237(?)). Therefore, Kiir -Aur studied both select groups of chosen illnesses that affected certain bodily areas, as well as how one or more complex illnesses could manifest themselves in a multitude of areas (cf. Wee 2012: 239). did not write a title in the final example; the remaining three are from Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur phase. 99 N4 A line - pretation is uncertain. Kiir -Aur may also have copied LKA 113 from an IM.G\u00cdD .DA of someone else (see Ch. 8 note 86). Kiir -Nab\u00fb copied at least two tablets from uiltus of a certain Aur -arrni (LKA 96, LKA 100).63 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru Complex diagnoses, as the ones discussed in Section 3.1, seem to require advanced medical understanding. Correlating symptoms with diagnoses and subsequently determining the cause behind the illness, is often described as a process illustrated by the Esagil-kn-apli recension of the diagnostic prognostic handbook Sa-gig, was arranged head-to -toe according to the symptom that was mentioned first in the description (Wee 2012: 222, 240; Hee\u00dfel 2000: 19, 24-30). Therefore, this subseries prioritizes symptom over illness in its arrangement (Wee 2012: 156, 476, 479). However, Sa- gig's practical use as well as its function for education is less clear (Robson 2008: 474; Hee\u00dfel 2000: 90-94; cf. Wee 2012: 239). Contemporary exorcist at the royal court in Nineveh never quoted the series, perhaps relying on observation, experience and pragmatism for prog - nostic purposes (Robson 2019: 118). Other scholars at the royal court quoted omen series such as Enma Anu Enlil extensively A few of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru diagnoses are comparable to concrete entries in Sa- gig. The aau diagnosis in BAM 129 col. iv 3' was partly duplicated in two sec- tions of Sa- gig, namely tablets 10 and 33.101 The line in BAM 129 states: \"[If a man]'s (and) his hips are stiff: aau is its name\".102 This line is almost duplicated in the two sections of Sa- gig, but with a variation between aau in Sa-gig 33 and \"Heavy Strings\" (SA .DUGUD) - another name for aau - in Sa-gig 10. Furthermore, all passages in Sa- gig add the symptoms stiff (au) hands and feet.103 100 In general, Sa-gig lists fewer illnesses as diagnoses than are known throughout the thera- peutic corpus, and only around 40 actual reasons for why an illness was caused are listed (Koch 2015: 277; Hee\u00dfel 2000: 58-60). See Johnson (2018) for a discussion of illness names in prescriptions and the diagnostic-prognostic series Sa- gig. 101 Sa-gig 10 = AMT 106,2 a-a = Sa- gig 33; AMT 106,2 = Sa- gig 10. 103 Although hands and feet are not mentioned in BAM 129 col. iv 3' , they are mentioned in the diagnosis following this entry:64 Chapter 3 Such correlations between Sa- gig and the therapeutic material seem to appear irregularly.104 However, a connection in Kiir -Aur 's tablets to Sa- gig is evident. It is unknown at what stage an ipu would have learned Sa- gig, although the N4 exercise BAM 310 suggests that such omens could have been introduced at an early stage.105 Unlike Finkel's (2000: 142) hypothesis, adopted by Wee (2012: 87, 452) that Sa- gig and its commentaries would be the work of advanced students, the evidence from Kiir -Aur does not show any traces of the Sa-gig series during his traceable educational phases. It should there - fore be noted that no copies of Sa-gig were found in the N4 collection, and almost no evidence for the series exists in Assur.106 In comparison, the N4 col- lection has not yielded a single regular manuscript of Maql\u00fb (Schwemer 2017: 50). Yet, in a list of tablet incipits ( VAT 13723+), presumably listing texts held in the N4 collection, the enumeration of the nine tablets of Maql\u00fb (col. i 5'-13') ends with the summary: \"Eight (tablets) of Maql\u00fb (incantations) Maql\u00fb: 2 (copies?)\" (ibid.: 51; Geller 2000: 227). The question remains how to interpret the last number, but Schwemer suggests that the collection held two complete copies of the whole series, perhaps on BAM 129 col. iv 14': DI Kiir -Aur 's BAM 131 obv. 9 duplicating Sa- gig 33 = SpTU IV no. 152 rev. 96 (Hee\u00dfel 2000: 353ff.), which Kiir -Aur copied at an unknown stage of his career. In the first subseries of the Nineveh Ugu series, the 2nd tablet (BAM 482) contain 10 passages duplicating diagnoses from Sa- gig 4 (Attia and Buisson 2003, MS H = Sa- gig 4: line 60 (= H 124), 126' (= H 31), 130' (= H 32), 134' (= H 17), 136' (= H 13), 238' (= H 15), 240' (= H 12), 241' (= H 10), 242' (= H 11), 243' (= H 8)). In the sulu subseries of Ugu edited by Cadelli (2000), we find one passage in the 3rd tablet (BAM 587) col. iii 7 duplicated in Sa- gig 18 line 24 (TDP: 170 line 24) and Sa- gig 33 line 92 = SpTU IV no. 152: 92, and one passage in col. iv 26 duplicated in Sa- gig 9 line 13 (TDP: 72 line 13) and Sa- gig 33 line 93 = SpTU IV no. 152: 93 (Hee\u00dfel 2000: 353ff.). SAG .KI.DAB .BA is not attested in Sa- gig, but it does occur several times in the first tablets of Ugu. However, several entries in Sa- gig begin with \"his temple is seized\" (SAG .KI-\u00fa DAB -su), which could indicate that the relationship between the two was self- evident (Wee 2012: 238 and note 90 for references). Wee's discussion of the diagnosis in BAM 129 col. iv 6' in relation to Sa- gig 33 rev. 96 is not relevant, as the entry in Sa- gig 33 likely relates to the aau diagnosis in BAM 131 obv. 9-10 (cf. Wee 2012: 473). 105 N4 no. 57 (= BAM 310) consists of nine lines and is designated as \"questions of Sa- gig\" on obv. 3-4: ma- al-a-te 4 a SA .GIG . The tablet is certainly an early school tablet. 106 Peders\u00e9n 1986: 50-51 and note 31; Peders\u00e9n (1986: 51) BAM 114 (N4 no. 354) opens with 10 single -line diagnoses concerning renal and rectal maladies (Geller 2005: 70-71), and KADP 22 (= N4 no. 487 = 3rd tablet of Uruanna) col. i-ii com- ments on the nature of certain diagnoses. 65 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru clay tablets or writing -boards . Noticeably, if the N4 collection held complete texts on writing -boards not represented in the surviving clay tablets, this has the implication that Sa- gig may have existed in the collection as well.107 This remains uncertain. The pre-Esagil-kn-apli recension(s) of Sa- gig appears to have been grouped according to particular maladies, prognoses, or divine agents with discon- nected symptom descriptions, and they mirror tendencies in groupings found in therapeutic texts (Wee 2012: around 700 BCE in uzirina (cf. STT 89).108 Considering that Assur and uzirina may have shared intel- lectual traditions to some extent,109 coupled with the fact that Assur has pro - vided almost no examples of Sa- gig (Hee\u00dfel 2010a: 160-61), Kiir -Aur may well have been taught according to different principles than the established Sa-gig series. Furthermore, these observations tentatively imply that the 2nd subseries of Esagil-kn-apli's Sa-gig was not required when learning about physiology or acquiring the ability to perform differential diagnosis. Although most therapeutic texts contain a lower density of symptom descriptions compared to Sa- gig, Wee (2012: 312) observed that therapeutic tablets frequently include several similar maladies, facilitating a degree of dif- ferential diagnosis (distinguishing similar illnesses) by juxtaposing notewor - thy symptoms that were used to distinguish the maladies (e.g., BAM 129). In the absence of Sa- gig, I believe acquiring the skill to perform differential diagnosis was among the purposes of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts. In addition to providing him with the relevant prescriptions for such maladies, the diagno - ses coupled with oral teachings received from his father in professional situ- ations would have enabled him to diagnose illnesses.110 Only circumstantial 107 Cf. Peders\u00e9n 1986: 50-51 and note 31; Hee\u00dfel 2000: 94, 109 and note 55. Maul (2010a: 207) proposes that the largely missing Sa- gig recensions in N4 may be related to the existence of separate collections. Presumably, the brother of Nab\u00fb-bssunu and of Kiir -Aur made their own collections elsewhere, and perhaps they subdivided their work into areas of responsibilities. Although the existence of more libraries is plausible, it remains uncer - tain if Esagil-kn-apli's Sa-gig was accepted in Assur (Hee\u00dfel 2010a: 161). For an example of a writing -board from N4, see Klengel-Brandt 1975. See also Section 9.2.1 on the use of writing -boards in N4. 108 STT 403, however, is a commentary on the Esagil-kn-apli recension of Sa- gig tablet 1-3. This version was therefore also known in uzirina (Wee 2012: 543ff.; Stol 1993: 91-98). 109 The evidence is tentative, and only overlaps have been pointed out (Reiner and Civil 1967: 209; Lambert 1959: 122, 124, 127-28). Furthermore, at least one son was sent to the uzirina school from Assur, albeit none from Hee\u00dfel 2010a: 161. 110 For therapeutic texts in relation to illness identification, see Johnson 2015.66 Chapter 3 evidence describe how aspiring ipus were taught the material they copied, but it is likely that the content copied became subject to dissemination within a scholarly context.111 Thus, these combined factors would have filled the gap left by the missing (written) Sa- gig tradition. Additionally, the following chap - ter argues that Kiir -Aur also acquired his physiological understanding of the human body from the therapeutic texts in combination with tangible experi- ence gained from aiding his father. 3.7 Preparation for Other Duties as amall\u00fb eru As amall\u00fb eru, Kiir -Aur copied KAL 4 no. 19, a fragmentary ritual text per - haps similar to a namburbi-ritual, LKA 43, a uilla-prayer (lit.: \"hand-lifting \") to Madnu, a divine to Marduk (Krebernik 2007: 356-57),112 N4 A 2191, a ritual against a ghost duplicating an uncertain part of BAM 323 (cf. Scurlock 2006: 712-713), and N4 no. 289, a ritual intended to provide a patient with a substitute for the goddess Erekigal among the categories for practicing iptu.113 Generally, namburbi-rituals were used apotropaically against worrying terrestrial, astrological, and birth omens, as well as to safeguard the diviner (Koch 2010: 46, 53; Maul 1994: 12-13). The uillas were adaptable prayers used by individuals to address particular concerns by petitioning (greeting) a specific deity.114 KAL 4 no. 19 is very poorly preserved, and considering that the first healing instruction for garbu in KAL 4 no. 41 ended similarly to one of three relatively badly preserved lines in KAL 4 no. 19: \"you throw (it) into the river\" ,115 KAL 4 no. 19 was perhaps not a namburbi-ritual. Section 6.4 evaluates Kiir -Aur 's other namburbi-ritual texts, which are all from his later phases. This adds to the suspicion that KAL 4 no. 19 was likely not a namburbi-ritual. Possibly, both 111 Sj\u00f6berg 1972. 112 LKA 43 contains a few mistakes in sign forms underlining that Kiir -Aur was a young apprentice when he copied this See obv. 7: can be distinguished: Emesal Sumerian prayers of the kal \u00fb, Sumerian prayers for the ms p\u00ee ritual, and (largely) Akkadian prayers as part of iptu (Frechette 2012: 3-4). A few more are also known from other professions via incipits (ibid.: 4-5). It is unclear if the ritual \"A substitute for Erekigal\" was included in the EM (see Geller 2018b: 299 line 20, 306). 114 Frechette 2012: 4, 7-8, 165-66. These prayers were included in, e.g., bt rimki and some namburbi-rituals . 115 KAL eru KAL 4 no. 19 and LKA 43 functioned as part of rituals that were intended to cure the divine cause behind some illnesses, and they attest to Kiir -Aur 's train- ing in these areas of practice (see Koch unpublished: 11 note 63; Hee\u00dfel 2000: 81-86; see Ch. 6 note 72). N4 no. 289 transfers illness through the use of ritual substitution. 3.7.1 Kiir-Aur's uilla-prayers uilla-prayers usually consist of an invocation of a deity, presentation of the worshipper and his/her need, petition for what is wished for, and a thanksgiv - ing Therefore, uillas were used to gain the aid of a deity by creating (= restoring) a favourable rela- tionship between supplicant and the divine sphere (Frechette 2012: 9). LKA 43 is addressed to Madnu and the text is largely similar to a uilla- prayer to Nusku.117 The text is known in multiple duplicates from the N4 library and Assur in general, and must have been broadly circulated among these specialists.118 The prayer is listed as part of bt sal m\u00ea, performed during Tartu in connection to the New Year celebrations, as well as the bt rimki ritual, which was associated with the substitute king ritual (Ambos 2013a: 42, 262ff.; Frechette 2012: 166, 169, 178; L\u00e6ss\u00f8e 1955: 25 col. iii 61). The various copies show slight individual differences in terms of con- tent, division of lines as well as number of lines, in addition to variants in writings.119 Consequently, at least LKA 43 appears not to have been written according to poetic principles that divide lines into evenly distributed verse units. Unfortunately, LKA 43 is the only duplicate of this prayer with a copying statement, which specifies that it was \"written and checked according to its original\".120 We can therefore hypothesize that LKA 43 was either not copied 116 KAR 44 obv. 4: U .\u00cdL.LA.KAM. 117 Madnu 1; Frechette 2012: 170 note 10, 178 note 6, 259; Mayer 1976: 394, 406. Nusku was also important in relation to the lamp present during healing ceremonies (Panayotov 2016). 118 KAL 4 no. 58, KAL 4 no. 59(=LKA 46 and 47a+b), LKA 44, LKA 45 (Frechette 2012: 259; KAL 4: 112-14). It appears as though all five examples of this prayer, including LKA 43, were writ - ten without instructions (Frechette 2012: 144 note 3). At least one uilla-prayer to Nab\u00fb was part of Gesche's 2nd school phase and is also found on prisms (Gesche 2001: 177, 193ff.). 119 Lines divided differently: obv. 1-2 vs. LKA 44 obv. 1, 4 no. 58 obv. 1; LKA 43 obv. 7-8 vs. LKA 4 obv. 1'-2' , KAL 4 no. 58 obv. 4. Couplets divided onto two lines: LKA 43 obv. 2-3 vs. LKA 44 obv. 2, 4 no. 58 obv. 2; LKA 43 obv. 5-6 vs. LKA 44 obv. 3, KAL 4 no. 58 obv. 3. Differing text in the various manuscripts: LKA 43 obv. 13-14/LKA 44 obv. 8/KAL ba-ri.68 Chapter 3 from the same tablet as the other examples, or that individual choice in lines and divisions was an active component when copying this text. Incidentally, only one additional uilla-prayer can be identified among Kiir -Aur 's tablets with colophons, namely LKA 40 for Tamtu.121 As argued in Section 7.2.1, this tablet likely derived from his mamau-phase. Despite these two being the only explicit examples of uillas copied by Kiir -Aur \"Hand-lifting \"-prayers (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 50). Although such texts could function in a variety of \"official\" state or tem- ple contexts, they could also be used to heal the cause behind an illness (see Ch. 6 note 72). Several lines of petitioning in LKA 43 focus on health and heal- ing, which supports this proposal.122 Certain \"Curses\" mmtu are frequently observed as Kiir -Aur 's opponents, and perhaps Madnu (justice) could dis - patch as well as remove such an affliction. As such, this prayer may be consid- ered an ad hoc item in Kiir -Aur 's ritualistic inventory. 3.7.2 N4 no. 289: A Substitute for Erekigal The ritual known as \"A man's substitute for Erekigal\" (ana pi amli by Kiir -Aur during his amall\u00fb eru-phase. This unpublished manuscript was listed by Peders\u00e9n (1986) as N4 no. 289. Only the upper half of the obverse and the colophon on the reverse are extant. The text duplicates Kiir -Nab\u00fb's LKA 79, written during an uncertain stage of his career \"for under - taking a (ritual) procedure\" and copied according to some unknown original,123 as well as the damaged text KAR 245 from an uncertain place in Assur.124 Furthermore, the N4 manuscript LKA 80 (N4 no. 324) partly duplicates some passages of N4 no. 289 and LKA 79 (see Tsukimoto 1985: 128-129). These texts have hitherto been the only known copies of this ritual, intended to substitute a patient with a female goat kid. The text may have been circulated particu- larly in Assur,125 although the ceremony must have been known in Nineveh since the rite was mentioned in two letters from the royal court: one inquiring why the ceremony had not been not performed for the king (SAA 10 no. 89), 121 LKA 40 rev. 12': KA.INIM.MA q\u00ed-bi TI.LA \"remove my illness, command LKA 79 ana DAB spellings in N4 no. 289 and LKA 79 only show small variations. 125 All currently known copies of the ritual are from Assur.69 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru and another stating that the ritual had been performed for Assurbanipal when he was crown prince (SAA 10 no. 193).126 The actions described in the preserved section of N4 no. 289 are described as follows: the ritual begins before sunset and takes place in the patient's house (obv. 2-5). The exorcist digs a hole in the earth, intended to function as a grave, and he makes the patient and the goat lie on the ground (obv. 6). He touches the patient's throat with a dagger made of tamarisk wood, and he cuts the throat of the goat with a dagger made of bronze (obv. 7-8). The insides of the \"dead\" (mtu, \u00da-ti), i.e., the goat, are washed, anointed and filled with aromatic plants (obv. 8-9). It is dressed in a garment, its feet supplied with san- dals, its eyes smeared with kohl, oil is poured on its head, and it is wrapped in the patient's turban (obv. 9-12). The goat is thereafter arranged and disposed of a dead man\" (obv. 12-13: ... GIM and various incantations and a lamentation are performed (obv. 1 3-15). N4 no 289 breaks off after this passage. In the duplicate LKA 79, the ritual concluded with funerary offerings (kispu) for Erekigal, the family's collective ghost, as well as the substitute animal itself, in order to keep the substitute in the netherworld and to ensure that it was accepted as a deceased family member. Finally, the goat is buried and the patient returns into the chamber (Verderame 2013: 315-317; Tsukimoto 1985: 134-135). The purpose of the ritual was to remove illness through substitution, i.e., by transferring the patient's persona to a female goat kid, and letting the prognos - ticated outcome of the ailment come to fruition. As such, the ceremony did not appease the cause of illness or eliminate the actual malady, but it moved the sufferer's identity to a substitute animal.127 Although Kiir -Nab\u00fb's copy was likely from a later phase of his career,128 Kiir -Aur may have copied the ritual in N4 no. 289 during an early stage of his amall\u00fb eru-phase. In the colophon, Kiir -Aur with aur\u00fb(?).129 This title for Nab\u00fb-bssunu 126 Verderame 2013: 315 note 54; see SAA 10 no. 89 rev. 5-6: \"... and (the ritual) 'A substi- tute . \"We shall perform (the ritual) n\u00e9-pa-\u00e1. SAA 10 no. 89 was sent by the Aur temple scholar Akkullnu (Section 2.3.5). 127 In some cases, it is possible that Erekigal's messenger \"Death\" , mtu, hid underneath the patient's bed and was ready to take a patient to the netherworld (Plantholt in 10). 128 I suggest this on the basis of the purpose statement in the colophon of LKA 79, see Section 7.4. 129 N4 rev. 3': DUMU amall\u00fb eru-phase, as argued in Section 5.4.1, then Nab\u00fb-bssunu may have been mamau aur\u00fb in the broken colophon of this text as well.70 Chapter 3 is otherwise only preserved among his own texts (see Ch. 2 note 44). Unless Nab\u00fb-bssunu held various titles at the same time, or was able to employ dif- ferent titles according to duties, N4 no. 289 would have been one of the earliest texts with colophons copied by Kiir -Aur (see also Section 5.4.1). This obser - vation is substantiated by a mistake in obverse line 13.130 In general, the rite was presumably employed in cases where a patient was considered severely ill, and if the household could afford the prescribed mate - rials (see Tsukimoto 1985: 130). Considering the copies from various career phases of the Bba- uma-ibni family members, it is plausible that the ritual was employed in this family as an ad hoc cure used in cases of severe illness. Kiir -Aur may have acquired knowledge about this ritual so he could aid his father in preparing and conducting the ceremony or for educational reasons without immediate practical application. 3.7.3 Activities Unrelated to Healing The unpublished manuscript N4 no. 241 contains brief words and phrases in Sumerian and Akkadian. The individual lines are ruled off from one another, clearly denoting individual entries. The outline suggests the text held incipits of individual compositions. However, the entries are not incipits, and individ- ual words are awkward and cannot be properly contextualized.131 Following 18 lines with individual entries, the text states: \"including 18? explanatory com- ments\" (rev. 3: EN 18? a-a-ti).132 The problematic term \u00e2tu can refer to lexical lists, commentaries, explanatory word lists, or generalized However, the exact nuances of the term can be difficult to evaluate in individual contexts, and my translation above is a tentative suggestion. The inclusion of the term in N4 no. 241 indicates that the manuscript was meant 130 N4 no. Kiir -Aur seems to have misread the passage on the original, perhaps intending to write ina KUN(I.DIB) \"by the threshold/doorsill\" instead of i-teb-bi. Thus, the line was misun- derstood and several mistakes occur, among these the superfluous ina and a lacking UD near the end. 131 teaching assistant, as sug - gested below, the content could originate in a specific teaching context, although the colophon specifies the text was \"copied and checked according to its original\" (Appendix 1). 132 The use of adi/EN in the meaning \"including\" is frequently attested in lists of various works (see Geller 2018b: 301 and note 29; Steinert 2018d: 204). 71 Kiir-Aur 's Magico-Medical Education as amall\u00fb eru to function as a commentary on various entries. However, this interpretation does not seem suitable based on the content. If the text functioned as a com- mentary, the explanatory element must have been supplied orally. Before the colophon, N4 no. 241 contains seven lines of uncertain content, which is located in a badly damaged section of the reverse of the tablet. If this pecu- liar text contains an inherent organizing principle, it cannot be understood from the preliminary reading. The colophon informs us that N4 no. 241 was copied and checked accord- ing to an original, that the text was an uiltu of Kiir -Aur , and finally that the tablet was copied on behalf of Kiir -Aur .133 As shown in Section 7.4.2, the three additional examples of tablets copied on Kiir -Aur 's behalf all origi- nate among his mamau and mama bt Aur tablets. N4 no. 241 is therefore the only text copied on Kiir -Aur 's behalf from any apprentice phase, and the text must be considered peculiar.134 Texts with similar content from early edu- cation phases are not widely attested in N4. The tablet N4 no. 241 therefore appears, to the best of my knowledge, to be unique in the N4 text collection. Judging from the content and colophon of N4 no. 241, the text seems to have been copied by a young pupil, who was presumably in the process of develop - ing his writing skills and literacy.135 N4 no. 241 therefore suggests that the junior apprentice Kiir -Aur acted as a teaching assistant to at least one younger stu- dent. However, this remains conjecture. We can only speculate on who this young student might have been. Yet, it is noteworthy that Nab\u00fb-bssunu's title \"exorcist of the Aur temple\" was written with a Babylonian form of the sign \u00c9. The sign suggests that the writer of the colophon had been exposed to Babylonian in addition to NA sign forms during his initial schooling.136 133 See Appendix 1. Sadly, the context of the final statement is damaged and the line contains an erasure, rev. 13: [a?-a]n?-i? \u00fa-\u00e1-\u00e1-ir *{ma}*. 134 Although the sign SAR in colophons, here and in other publications, tends to be read as a G- stem of the verb aru \"to write, copy\" , it cannot be excluded that some of these generic statements could have been causative -stems . E.g., LKA 119 from Kiir -Aur Aur-phase was \"copied and checked\" (SAR -ma ba-r\u00ec), but it appears to have two mistakes in the colophon, which Kiir -Aur cannot have made at this stage of his career: a missing <a> in Kiir -Aur 's name rev. 16 and Bba- uma-ibni's name spelled in an otherwise unattested manner in the family's colophons as p.dBa-ba?. Still, one would have expected the writing SAR .SAR or SAR .ME for a -stem of aru. 135 This observation confirms the interpretation of the title amall\u00fb as \"apprentice\" , as a per - son striving towards becoming skilled at a trade. In the case of ipus, the title implies that the person had acquired basic literacy. 136 Kiir -Nab\u00fb explicitly notes that several manuscripts from which he copied were in Babylonian writing (Section 9.2.1).72 Chapter 3 3.8 Summary Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase tablets mainly focus on treatments of bodily symptoms, although he also copied material related to soothing the cause of an illness. The diagnoses attested in the texts can generally be considered complex. It is therefore peculiar that the diagnostic-prognostic series Sa- gig is completely missing from the written remains of Kiir -Aur 's education, and it remains uncertain when Kiir -Aur was educated in Sa- gig and if the family made use of this series at all. The material indicates that the diagnoses in the therapeutic texts were intended to function as the basis for Kiir -Aur 's educa- tion in how to diagnose and treat illnesses. Tablets appear to have been copied according to assignments focusing on, for example, a physiological area, a section of a collection of therapeutic pre - scriptions, or according to a specific malady. Furthermore, in at least Kiir - Aur 's case, snakebites, scorpion stings, and horse treatments were studied on equal footing with the other treatment texts. Kiir -Aur presumably extracted an idiosyncratic sourcebook from one or more writing -boards related to a recension of Ugu, throughout his amall\u00fb eru-phase. This is discussed fur - ther in Sections 9.2 and 9.3. Additionally, this chapter showed that Kiir -Aur copied tablets concerning uilla-prayers and ritual instructions, possibly to familiarize himself with methods for treating a cause of illness. Kiir -Aur also copied a ritual to provide a substitute for a patient. They were therefore part of the relevant tools for Kiir -Aur 's education as a healer. Finally, a tablet copied on behalf of Kiir -Aur suggests he may have functioned as a teaching assistant for novice students. Venom treatments and veterinary prescriptions may have been used to con- ceptualize several physiological processes of the human body and perhaps human prescriptions could be applied to animals in some instances. These suggestions form the basis for a broader discussion of Kiir -Aur 's education in physiology as amall\u00fb eru in the following chapter.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 005 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.Chapter 4 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru Kiir -Aur copied treatments for snakebites, scorpion stings, and horse mala- dies on RA 15 pl. 76, and these cures only occur during Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase. They are found on a tablet that was labelled as the 32nd(?) extract. This tablet likely played a role in Kiir -Aur 's education as amall\u00fb eru, although it is difficult to evaluate what impact this knowledge had on his overall education. This chapter discusses the possible benefit in practical, physiological, and educational knowledge that Kiir -Aur may have gained from RA 15 pl. 76. The first section investigates the snakebite and scorpion sting treatments on the obverse of RA 15 pl. 76 in the context of envenomation. By analys - ing the cultural and physical role of snakes and scorpions in Mesopotamia, the section argues that the physical effects of venom produced remarkable effects. These outcomes were observed as an awe -inspiring force, which also illustrated vividly how various physiological processes functioned in actual patients. Whether or not Kiir -Aur was involved in these treatments him- self, the section argues that this knowledge introduced him to powerful fluids which were associated with bile and saliva in humans. By extension, venom may have been used to illustrate awe -inspiring fluids inherent in various species. By discussing the role of veterinarian knowledge among exorcists in the NA period, Section 4.2 evaluates Kiir -Aur 's use of such knowledge for under - standing human physiology based on the reverse of RA 15 pl. 76. Addition- ally, it discusses Kiir -Aur 's possible practical use of such treatments. The following section discusses animal variants of human illnesses to contextu- alize veterinarian medicine within the therapeutic corpus. Finally, Section 4.4 evaluates the use of animal anatomical terms in medical texts to argue that animal physiology and anatomy were occasionally used to explain human physiology and anatomy. Thereupon, certain physiological over - laps related to breathing, with a focus on the nose, are investigated to argue that Kiir -Aur may have acquired anatomical knowledge about the nose, throat, lungs, and breath from certain treatments applied via a tube into the nose.74 Chapter 4 4.1 The Role of Venom in Kiir -Aur 's Anatomical Understanding This section argues that Kiir -Aur was introduced to cures related to snake and scorpion venom on the obverse of RA 15 pl. 76. By applying these treat - ments to envenomed patients, Kiir -Aur gained experience with the effects of venom. Thus, he was exposed to the power of venom as a concept, which helped him gain an improved understanding of physiological processes. Snake and scorpion venom (imtu) have pronounced physical effects on the victims (see below). What follows demonstrates that venom was considered an impor - tant cultural concept for illustrating the physiological processes of the body and for metaphorically expressing the function of illnesses. By extension, knowledge of venom and its effects was probably more important than has previously been recognized (cf. Finkel 1999: 213). 4.1.1 Snakes and Scorpions in Mesopotamia Snakes (ru) and scorpions (zuqaqpu)1 were common in Mesopotamia and both must have been observed frequently in people's houses,2 and their sight - ings were integrated into the 1st subchapter of Sa- gig.3 Evidence suggests that scorpions could be found under the bed or in storerooms,4 and snakes could 1 The word \"scorpion \" was frequently written with the Sumerogram G\u00cdR.TAB , which could be translated as \"the burning dagger \" (patru amu), describing the painful sensation of being stung . 2 Several tablets in umma lu were devoted to occurrences involving snakes (tablet 22-26) and scorpions (tablet 30-31) (Freedman 2006a; see Freedman 2006b for a commentary on the snake omens). Only fragments of umma lu exist from N4 (KAL 1 no. 19, 35, 45, and 55; cf. the namburbi-rituals against snakes in Maul 1994: 270ff.). For a discussion of this series in Hee\u00dfel 2007a: 2-10; cf. Freedman 1998: 322-23. umma lu concerns everyday phenomena in the immediate environment of a man and his house (Koch 2015: 233ff. with a comprehensive overview; see also Guinan 2014: 117-18; Guinan 1996). However , a purely for umma lu seems unlikely (Rochberg 2011: 623-24). 3 See Labat 1951: 8-11. Snakes and scorpions were not the only creatures whose appearance was assessed during the diagnostic process . 4 Scorpions are observed in a number of \"bed- scenes\" under the marriage bed (Stol 2000: 118 and note 46 with references). A number of omens in umma lu concern observing a scor - pion on, e.g., a man 's bed (Freedman 2006a: 136-37 tablet 30 line 35'-36'). Scorpion incan- tations indicate the places in which scorpions were found (Foster 1996: 861): \"It is green in the thornbush(?), it is silent in the sand, it is venomous in the brickmold\", 141-42 obv. 7-9); CT 38 pl. 38 obv. 59 refers to a scorpion as the \" wolf of the storeroom, lion of the larder \" (Pientka 2004: 394; 121-23).75 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru easily make their way into one's house through, e.g., a drain or sewer.5 Fur - thermore, both were part of the magical sphere and were used metaphorically in various cultic contexts.6 Both creatures also appear frequently on amulets against the demon Lamatu (Wiggermann 2000: 239, 341). The use of these creatures in Mesopotamian metaphorical and associative thought is well attested. Snakes were for example used to describe an infant child coiled up within the mother and coming out slithering like a snake.7 Scorpions were the symbol for motherhood and were related to fertility and the image of the married woman through the goddess Iara.8 By exten- sion, the scorpion and snake illustrate domestic life and combine the concepts of life (renewal, birth), family (motherhood, womanhood), and death (venom). 5 umma lu (Freedman 2006a: 46) tablet 23 line 102-4 states: \"If a snake gives birth in the asurr\u00fb of a man 's house: ... (negative apodosis), 103 If a snake nests in the asurr\u00fb of a man 's house: ... (negative apodosis), 104 If a woman catches a snake unaware in the asurr\u00fb and lets it go: ...

George 2009: 156 no. 19 obv. 2-3: \u00fa-ul- da-u-ma! 3 ...). The asurr\u00fb can refer to either a \"sewer \" or the \" wall foot - ing\" (George 2015: 99-102). Although the first millennium meaning seems to favour the latter , omen literature retains the original meaning (ibid.). Snakes were also associated with water and the underworld (Pientka-Hinz 2009: 217 ). 6 Snake charmers (mulau) were known at the NA court and are mentioned in Maql\u00fb (Abusch with clay snakes are also known from 8th and 7th century Assur , (Pientka-Hinz 2009: 221 with references; Ismail 1982 : 199 and fig. 3; Klengel-Brandt 1968 pl. 8). Various gods , such as Erekigal and Ningizida, are associated with mythological beings , which are part snake or muuu, bamu) (Pientka-Hinz 2009: 215). (MUL G\u00cdR.TAB ) and \" snake \" (MUL dMU) are mentioned in the astrological compendium Mul-apin (see \" scorpion \" and \" snake \" in Watson and Horowitz 2011; Hunger and Pingree 1999; Koch 1995; Stol 2000: 10 and note 59. Snakes may have been related to fertility or youth on the basis of their \"renewal\" when shedding their skin (Pientka-Hinz 2009: 216; see George 2003: 722-23 lines 305-6). It is noteworthy that the snake who steals Gilgame' plant of life smells the plant. Concerning smell and life, see Ch. 4 note 88. 8 A number of bed scenes also display a scorpion underneath the bed, probably referring to the couple 's married aspect (Winter 2012: 355). The scorpion was also the symbol of the pal- ace women in the NA palaces , and it can be found on various objects excavated in these (Melville 2004: 50-51; Ornan 2002: 470-71). Their relationship to motherhood is clear from the fact that they carry their young around on their back after birth ( Pientka 2004: 396-97). The NA queen am\u00e2 's seal likely features Gula and her dog, with a scorpion behind the god- dess (Hussein 2016 pl. 133a; see also the articles in Curtis et al. 2008 concerning the royal queens' tombs in Nimrud). Occasionally , the false mother Lamatu is depicted with a scor - pion beneath her legs (Wiggermann 2000: 234 ).76 Chapter 4 Snakes and scorpions were therefore important for the metaphoric expres - sion of the Mesopotamian understanding of the world, and, as we shall see below, their venom was important in the Mesopotamian understanding of how illnesses affected the body. Therefore, encountering patients suffering from these bites and stings also taught the student about both the body's phys - iological processes, on the basis of observable features, and the metaphoric relationships between medical knowledge and the cause of symptoms.9 4.1.2 Venom and Physiology Many types of scorpions and snakes were differentiated in ancient Mesopo - tamia, as listed, for example, in Ur-ra tablet 14.10 While it is difficult to cor - relate the historical evidence with modern taxonomy, we know at least eight species of venomous snakes and three species of venomous scorpions native to Iraq (Habeeb and Rastegar -Pouyani 2016: 67; Chippaux and Goyffon 2008: 72). Among the widely distributed venomous snakes are the Desert Horned Viper (Cerastes (Pseudocerastes sicus persicus/fieldi).11 Among the venomous scorpions are (Leiurus quinquestriatus) and the Fattail Scorpion (Androctonus crassicauda).12 Venomous snakes and scorpions can inject venom through bites and stings, which have a variety of physical effects, as shown in Table 5. Due to the effects of venom, the Akkadian concept imtu was generally con- sidered to be awe -inspiring and was used as a metaphor in incantations to establish the effects of an illness or demon.13 Furthermore, symptoms such as \"paralysis\" (immatu) that were commonly experienced with bites or stings 9 See the tablet published by Nougayrol (1972 : 141) with a drawing of a scorpion. It is unclear if the writer had observed a scorpion up close. 10 Pientka 2004: 395; Landsberger 1962 55. During an excavation in the 1950s in northeastern Iraq , a group collected several ven- omous snakes , e.g., Desert Cobra (Walterinnesia aegyptia) 12 Goyffon 2008: 2002: 41-42. In the Al-Anbar province in 2009, various snakes and scorpions , including both the Deathstalker and Fattail Scorpion, were observed (Fadhil et al. 2009: 38 ). 13 E.g., in relation to the illness makadu: \"It took half the venom of the snake (and) it took half the venom of the scorpion \", BAM 124 col. include Lamatu' s venom, which is occasionally described in a similar manner (Farber 2014: 156-57 line 127 ; Pientka 2004: 399).77 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru Table 5 Attested effects of snake and scorpion venoma Attested and reported effects of venom Snake Scorpion Local Symptoms Pains + + Swelling + + Redness + + Numbness + Burning sensations + + Haemorrhaging + Tissue necrosis + Systemic Symptoms Abnormal coagulationb + Sluggishness, paralysis, muscle rigidity + + Nausea, Vomiting + + Renal and general organ failure + + Dark urine + Low blood pressure (Hypotension) + + Sweating + Weakness of one entire side of the body (Hemiparesis) + Brain stroke (Ischemia) + Respiratory failure + + Convulsions + Abdominal pain + Diarrhoea + a For snakes, see Rebahi et al. Note that several the acute systemic symptoms are attested infrequently (cf. Rebahi et al. 2014; Cesaretli and 973-74. Note that \"irrespective of different species of scorpions, clinical manifestations are similar with varying degrees of severity\" (Angsanakul and Stiprija 2013: 81; cf. critique in Boyer et al. 2009: 632). Only few patients experience a majority of symptoms, although chil- dren are especially susceptible to die from the venom (Chippaux and Goyffon 2008: 76-77; Sofer et al. 1994: 973). Generally, children are more affected by venom. b Coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. This can lead to, e.g., bleeding gums (Alirol et al. 2010: 3).78 Chapter 4 became identified as an illness category.14 Some of the very visible effects of envenomation may have been used to establish relationships between ill- nesses associated with snakes and scorpion venom. One example is the so -called arai-incantations , which were used in connection to love magic, fertility, scorpion stings, \"string\" illnesses, and witchcraft.15 By combining these incantations' themes with one noticeable symptom of scorpion envenomation, priapism, one cannot help but associ- ate the scorpion stings with potency, as well as the various metaphoric rela- tionships inherent in scorpions, such as motherhood and the (marriage) bed (see above).16 Furthermore, the name for scorpion in Akkadian, zuqaqpu, may derive from the verbal root zaqpu \"to erect, to point upward\". The Akkadian scorpion, zuqaqpu, has therefore been translated as the \"erector\" , because its venomous stinger stands erect when confronted with danger (Pientka 2004: 391). Scorpion venom could cause priapism and this symptom may provide an additional reason for this name.17 Notably, the symptoms from a lethal envenomation would have affected most bodily functions, thereby demonstrating the venom's effect on breathing, 14 E.g., 1996. 16 This relationship between venom and its connection to potency may have influenced the reasoning behind the following medication: \"If a man is ill at his testicle(s), you crush a dried scorpion, you drink it in beer and he will live\"; BAM 396 col. iv 13-14: DI NA IR-\u00fa GIG .DU \"If a man [is ill] at his testicle(s), you soak a living scorpion <in> a hardened vessel with oil ...\"; BAM 396 col. iv 15: DI and 85-86). 17 Although this symptom mainly occurs in \"older \" children (Sofer et al. 1994: 976), it is also attested in adults in relation to scorpion stings from, e.g., the Fattail Scorpion (Bawaskar and Bawaskar 2012: 49).Attested and reported effects of venom Snake Scorpion Involuntary eye movement (Nystagmus) + Dilation of pupils (mydriasis) + Involuntary and painful erection (priapism) + Excessive salivation + Low body temperature (Hypothermia) + Heart attack +Table 5 Attested effects of snake and scorpion venom (cont.)79 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru the \"strings\" , the abdomen (renal and rectal symptoms), mouth, the impaired function of the motoric system (via pains, paralysis and convulsions), and perhaps even death. Furthermore, the symptoms affecting the mouth and anus would have been particularly obvious through vomiting and defeca- tion. I therefore propose that Kiir -Aur did not only learn treatments related to snakebites and scorpion stings in order to heal them, but he also used his observations of the effects of venom to visualize how the human body func- tioned when engaged with its awesome power. As will be shown in the next section, venom (imtu), bile (martu) and spittle (rutu, ruputu, illtu) were to some extent conceptually interconnected. Despite being different fluids, they were equated in lexical lists and were possibly believed to possess some of the same qualities.18 The physiological functions of bites and stings may therefore have been part of a larger theoretical illustration of how interspecies physiology and such fluids in particular were believed to function. Thus, Kiir -Aur may have been exposed to the framework of a \"uni- versal\" venomous substance inherent in all animals and humans when learning about venom treatments. Interestingly, the majority of symptoms encountered in all the therapeutic diagnoses that Kiir -Aur copied as amall\u00fb eru could be caused by an especially venomous bite or sting. Therefore, being exposed to victims of bites or stings would have demonstrated a majority of bodily func- tions for a student, on the basis of which it would have been possible to concep - tualize how some aspects of human physiology functioned. 4.1.3 The Physiological Conception of Venom, Bile, and Saliva The term \"venom\" (imtu), attested in connection to a variety of animals such as scorpions and snakes, was linked in lexical lists to other fluids believed to possess some of the same awe -inspiring qualities that affected various bodily processes.19 In a recension of the lexical list Diri, known from both NA Nineveh and Assur,20 lines 117-123 of the the first tablet provide readings of the Sum- erogram \u00da as \"spittle, saliva, Scurlock and Andersen (2005: 696 note 261, 728 note 29) have criticized the use of lexical lists as sources for establishing connections between illnesses , as they mainly group illnesses together based on \"logographic rather than pragmatic affinities\" (Wee 2012: 254-55). However , Wee (ibid.: 329) himself saw a use of certain lexi- cal material in commentaries , and Scurlock and Andersen (2005: 693, note 195, 728 note 29) stated that some illnesses associated in writing also shared symptoms . Regardless , interpretation was likely a central undertaking in understanding the scholarly written tra- ditions , and, e.g., lexical lists and commentaries could be used to interpret omens (Frahm 2010a: 97-99; see also Veldhuis 195 ; 152; references can be found in CAD I-J : 139 . 20 The examples from Assur are exercise tablets with extracts , Civil 2004: 104-5. in Uruanna21 and in Malku tablet 8.22 The question of what motivated these conceptual overlaps is discussed in what follows, beginning with bile in the human body followed by a discus - sion of saliva in relation to witchcraft.23 Bile (martu) was known, then as now, as a yellow -green fluid derived from the gallbladder that had a significant colour and smell.24 Due to its significant colour and smell, bile was related to a variety of human problems and illnesses, such as jaundice (azu, amurriqnu).25 Furthermore, it may have been believed to govern certain physiological processes. B\u00f6ck has recently argued: \"The association of 'bile' with the accumulation of water ... points to two Ancient Mesopotamian ideas of the body: one is that bile was believed to cause, regulate or distrib - ute abundant water in the body; and the other is that abundant water in the intestines was believed to cause severe troubles\" (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 127-28).26 In 21 K\u00f6cher cites der (martu)\" 1978 : 35-36 note 59). 22 line 124: imtu : martu (Hra 2010: 144). 23 Although lexical evidence is regularly criticized as a source for conception rather than groupings according to similarities in Sumerograms , the fact that all the terms quoted above could be read from the same Sumerogram indicates that these terms were related concepts (see Ch. 4 note 18). 24 In addition to butchers noticing bile during the removal of the liver and the gallbladder from butchered animals , inspections connected to extispicy noted whether or not the gallbladder was intact and if bile flowed from it (Koch 2000: 514 with textual references; Meyer 1987 : 143-44). 25 This overlap occurs particularly because of the shared yellow -green colour , which in Akkadian is the same word ((w)arqu, SIG). Jaundice can cause yellow discolouration of the eyes , base of the tongue, and skin, and bile is naturally yellow -green. Further - more, gall-bladder disorder can result in miscoloured stools and urine. The two common terms for jaundice are azu \" catcher -(demon)\" from azu \"to seize, hold a person \" and amurriqnu from warqu \"to be yellow -green \". For these illnesses and associations in cuneiform medicine and incantations forthcoming; B\u00f6ck 2014a: Water was related ation and birth (Stol 2000: 4-6, 62, 125-26; beginning of Enma eli in Lambert 2013: 50ff.), and the connection between jaundice and bile - the latter as a regulator of water - may have been linked to the fact that infants , i.e., the product of creation and birth, regularly suffered from jaundice. For the connection between bile and stomach pains , see Steinert and Vac\u00edn 2018; 1969: 92-93 line 47: \"For his heart was vomiting e-p\u00ed-i-ma li-ib -ba- u i-ma- a ma- ar-ta-am. Bile was also related to \"burning \" amu, as evidenced by Malku 81 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru one reference, divine saliva is also associated with jaundice, and by extension with bile.27 In addition to martu, another type of bile is also recognized, namely paittu.28 Paittu was related to the abdomen and the epigastrium through an association with vomiting.29 Furthermore, paittu was connected to Lamatu.30 Importantly for the present discussion, it could be written with the Sumero - gram Z\u00da.MU.\u00cc.GU.E.31 One translation of this Sumerogram could be \"the snakebite's hurtful 'oil'\" , as a reference to the venom emanating from the snake's tablet 4 line 54: a-mi-a -at l\u00ecb-bi = mar -t\u00fa \"that which burns in the inside of the body = bile\" (Hra 2010: 94-95; CAD : 65). 27 The UET 85 obv. 1-10: i-za -an-na- s saliva pours down like rain, may his spittle become yellow as a turtle because of jaundice.

Meier (1939 : 302) translated paittu as \"Gallenfl\u00fcssigkeit\". See also Cadelli 2000: 343, 379 ; Wiggermann 2000: 225 note 44. 29 See examples in B\u00f6ck 2014a: 123-24; Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 137. The illness is fea- tured several times in the second column of the 3rd tablet of the sulu subsection of the therapeutic series Ugu no. 43 obv. 11, read by MIN pa-it-t[u] m\u00edmar -tu \" mouth of the karu' (pylorus?)) : paittu, the daughter \" (Geller 2014: 3 with references). Neither K\u00f6cher (1978 : 24), Hee\u00dfel (2010b: 30), B\u00f6ck (2014a: 124) nor Steinert (2016: M\u00cd and therefore read \" Gallensaft, Gallenblase(nkrankheit)\". However , at least the copy indicates that the M\u00cd was present, and the question is how to interpret it. If we follow Geller 's transliteration, m\u00edmar -tu, it could be a reference to \"daughter \", indicating paittu was \"the daughter \", i.e., like Lamatu (see Wiggermann 2000: 225-26). Or perhaps the illness was considered the daughter of Lamatu, i.e., an associative symptom/demon? Notably , Lamatu is mentioned directly above in the text in obv . 10 (Geller 2014: 3). 30 In Atra -ass paittu is described as follows: \"Let there be among the peoples the Pittu- demon, to snatch the baby from the lap of her who bore it\" (Lambert s mythological and patho - genic roles wherein she is a (frustrated) mother (ummu) and rejected daughter (martu) of Anu who causes fever (ummu) and bile (martu). 31 Scurlock and Andersen in B\u00f6ck 2007: 224 ms A (pl. 28-29) col. i 17'-18', which is the Akkadian translation of the Sumerian Z\u00da .MU.\u00cc.GU.E.\u00da.82 Chapter 4 tooth.32 This Sumerogram therefore seems to equate the problem with a ven- omous fluid (\"oil\"), which hurts, and is associated with the mouth (or literally \"tooth\" in the snake analogy). A first millennium Babylonian commentary on Sa-gig tablets 13 and 12 or 14 states: \"Paittu venom means paittu that holds bile\".33 Kiir -Aur also encountered paittu once, namely in his amall\u00fb eru manuscript RA 40 pl. 116.34 As such, both fluids were associated with venom and bodily processes, possibly indicating that bile may have been considered a \"venom\" inherent in mammals. Phlegm, spittle, and saliva (rutu, ruputu) were connected to witchcraft (kipu).35 An incantation could therefore be expressed simply as \"spittle\" , i.e., something thrown (nad\u00fb) from the mouth (CMAwR 1: 4; Schwemer 2007a: 16-21). Spittle was an ambivalent substance, much like bile, and could grant life and recovery as well as contamination and illness.36 Furthermore, witchcraft could produce a number of characteristic symptoms. One group of symptoms comprised various abnormal states in the mouth involving phlegm and the overproduction of saliva (Schwemer 2007a: 169-70 and notes 23, 25). Exces - sive saliva could also be caused by scorpion envenomation and be observed as venom in the mouth of snakes about to bite. Therefore, such fluids may have been compared to spittle in the mouth of ill- wishers who were magically manipulating a victim through witchcraft or as phlegm in the lungs and throat of people under attack from witchcraft. This requires further investigation 32 I read the Sumerogram as Z\u00da.MU \" snakebite \" (for Z\u00da as \"bite \", see Appendix 2), \u00cc \"oil\", and the Sumerogram differently , and saw it as a reference to an attack on the dental nerves (Cf. K\u00f6cher 1978 : 36). Scurlock and Andersen (2005: 704 note 119) agree with \" snake bite\" for Z\u00da.MU, and see the Sumerogram as \"a reference to the quality of the pain \". Cf. B\u00f6ck' s discussions of the image of the snake spit- ting venom in relation to bile to express fury and anger (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 126 and note 108 with references). 33 GCBC 4: \u00fa-kul-lu, see Jim\u00e9nez 2015 with further references and discussions concerning this tablet. Jim\u00e9nez reads the entry differently as: \"The 'poisonous pittu- 35 CMAwR 1: 4. However , note that such references were more frequently written U or U. The sign U was also equated with imtu \" venom \" in bilingual incantations and the phrase imat marti \" venomous bile\" could therefore be understood as \"spittle mixed with bile\" (ibid.: 195 ). 36 CMAwR 1: 4. Note the 1st tablet of Atra -ass lines 231-34 in connection to the creation of man: \" After she had mixed that clay, she summoned the Anunnaki, the great gods . The Igigi, the great gods , spat upon , saliva 's use in healing rituals appears to be limited (Schwemer 2007a: 18 note 60).83 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru elsewhere. Although Kiir -Aur may not have encountered witchcraft (kipu) as amall\u00fb eru, several symptom descriptions mention phlegm.37 Regarding saliva, it is interesting to note that the Mesopotamians do not seem to have described rabies metaphorically as connected to spittle. We know from incantations that the ancient Mesopotamians were aware that rabies infected new hosts through saliva (Finkel 1999: 213-223). However, references are largely to the dog's semen (nlu) being in the mouth (p\u00fb) or on its teeth (innu) and infecting through a bite (niku).38 Thus, several relationships between venom and other bodily fluids can be explained through analogies inherent in the symptoms of, e.g., scorpion enven- omation. As such, the overarching conceptions investigated here could have been taught to Kiir -Aur in connection with his encounter with scorpion and snake venom and possibly with envenomed patients. 4.2 Veterinarian Knowledge in Kiir -Aur 's Education Veterinarian prescriptions only appear during Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru- phase, i.e., his first (traceable) stage of education, and they therefore played a role in the education that he received during this period. Kiir -Aur acquired the requisite knowledge for his education from a therapeutic tra- dition that may have been specific to Assur (see Section 9.5.3). Within this tradition, there existed various veterinarian remedies. Although veterinarian as\u00fbs had existed in the OB period, there is, to the best of my knowledge, no evidence in the written documentation for as\u00fbs or ipus specialized in any type of animal medicine during the NA period.39 As a result, who administered animal healing in the NA period remains uncertain. 37 BAM 201 obv. 29': ... KI \u00da . 41: \u00da d\u00cdD ina A NAG . 38 Wu 2001: 34. However , note the description of the asakku- demon in Lugal- e, which also references a scorpion attack, in line 172: \"he drips the (venomous) water (or saliva?) a da-bi-a mu-un- sur-sur-re (ibid.: specialized as\u00fbs in the 3rd millennium BCE, as well as in the OB and NB periods . The only NA example stems from the annals of Esarhaddon. A broken list of deportees mentions the word muna iu,\" veterinarian \" (CAD M/2: 199) or \" animal surgeon \" (CDA : 216); a participle derived from 114 section 80 col. i 10'). The word is attested in the lexical series Lu I as: A.ZU ANE = mu-na- i-i-\u00fa (see CAD M/2: 199 for further references). Maul (2013: 18) con- sidered the knowledge of the unknown \"Pferdedoktoren \" to be so important that it was 84 Chapter 4 Some anatomical terms were derived from animal anatomy (see Section 4.4.1). Human and animalistic physiology therefore likely coalesced to an indeterminable extent.40 Thus, knowledge of animalistic anatomy may have been useful for understanding human anatomy and physiology. Comparably, veterinary medicine appears as a separate discipline in the later Hippiatrica (5th-6th century CE), although some healing for horses is reported to have been borrowed from the realm of human healing and some cures are said to be effective for humans.41 Labat even saw a thematic relationship between the Akkadian medical texts and Greek and Latin hippiatric texts, suggesting that veterinarians in Anatolia drew upon Akkadian human medicine in their works (Labat 1951: XLIII- XLV ).42 The inclusion of these cures in human medicine, such as the references to horse treatments in ammu ikinu,43 could suggest that these genres were not considered separate in Mesopotamian thought. It is therefore plausible that (Assur) healers drew both on human and veterinarian prescriptions to apply treatments to humans in the NA period, even though there are only a few indi- cations for this. Additionally, there is evidence that healers in theory also used treatments designed for humans to treat animals (see Section 3.5.2). 4.2.1 Horses and Specialists Horses were very valuable in the NA period (Radner 1997: 305-6) and were historically part of a specialist sphere of written knowledge in Assur. Horses were important for the Assyrian army from the MA period onwards (Maul 2013: 17-18 and note 9), for which role they needed to be trained. A specialist called the susnu, \"horse trainer\" , was responsible for training horses for chariots (see CAD /3: 378-80). A number of MA texts written by a susnu instruct the reader in the \"Trainierung von Wagenpferden\" ,44 and one such text is even stated to included in the written human healing texts . In general, there may occasionally be an overlap in terminology . The as\u00fb Ur-Lugaledena from Laga (ca. 2100) was described as as\u00fb even though he was dedicated to akkan and his seal features equipment for the birth of cattle (Stol 2011: 379). In OB Mari, references to as\u00fbtu, the craft of the as\u00fb, may describe veterinarian praxis (ibid.: 379 and note 120 with references). 40 Animals were occasionally used for comparison in the physiognomic omens (B\u00f6ck 2000: 40 with references). 41 McCabe 2007: 4, 6, 15, 42-43, 144-145, 276 , 278 . 42 A study of the Akkadian loanwords in the Ugaritic hippiatric texts suggests that these drew on Akkadian material as well (Watson 2004). 43 E.g., Stadhouders 2012: 3 \u00a715'; Stadhouders M1 and M2; Ebeling 1951. These MA texts were perhaps associated with similar Hittite texts (cf. Ebeling 1951: 58-60; Cohen and Sivan 1983 78-80 for references; Maul 2013: 17 ). 85 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru be the \"2nd [tablet/writing -board]\" of some unknown collection.45 Although this knowledge was not transmitted in writing into the NA period, the tradition exemplified by these texts may have been kept alive through oral transmission into the NA Period.46 Texts connected to the wellbeing of animals were also included in the AMC47 and the EM, of which the latter example was probably intended to prevent the spread of illness in horse stables and cattle pens, as well as camp areas.48 Per - haps included under these headings is a namburbi-ritual from Nineveh, which was performed so \"that di u-illness , plague and pestilence may not approach the king's ho[rses and] troops\".49 This ritual even included the participation of the king himself, was performed in camp (lines 27 and 65),50 and included the exorcist making amulets for the horses (line 60).51 Maul (2013) recently edited a group of texts attested from the MA period to the 7th century in Nineveh that are connected to the purification of the stables.52 The MA tablet VAT 10035 (= ms A) contained an initial incanta- tion only in Sumerian, to which the later copies added interchanging lines of Akkadian (Maul 2013: 20-21). Although ms A states that it was copied from an \"Akkadian tablet\" , probably referring to Babylonia, this tradition was surely sustained, translated, and transmitted through the first millennium in an Assyrian tradition.53 The texts mention that horses were subject to an elaborate ritual performed by an exorcist. Therefore, these MA and NA texts, combined 45 Ebeling 1951: 11, ms A rev. 4'-6': 76 . 46 The commentary VAT 9426 is perhaps younger than the MA texts (Ebeling 1951: 6). 47 AMC line 121: \"If horses in the stable [... are] (and) an 25; KAR 44 rev . 24, see Ch. 4 note 60. 49 Maul 2013: 18-19 and notes 19 and 26 with references ; 1970 : : 121 line 27: \"You have the king recite 'Lord, the strong one of all the great gods'\" 1970 : 120, 123 line 65: \"(and) anger (of the gods) will not approach the king 's horses (and) camp , and ...\" , 120, 123 line 60: \"... You [place] (the pouch) on the G\u00da ANE.KUR.RA ta-[ak -kan ]. Amulet stones for the king 's and royalty 's chari- ots are also mentioned in other exorcistic texts (Schuster -Brandis 2008: 354-56; cf. Maul 2013: 18-19 and note 21-23 with references). Such stones were also included in a newly built trough area in connection to Sennacherib 's new ekal marti in Nineveh, as listed on an inscription from an inscribed trough (MacGinnis 1989: 189). See also Nadali and Verderame 2014. 52 The MA copy VAT 10035 (= ms A) was copied by an ipu (Maul 2013: 19 ). 53 Maul (2013: 20-21) also noted several Assyrianisms in the later copies .86 Chapter 4 with the examples of veterinarian medicine found in the N4 collection, point to the existence of various traditions concerning knowledge of horses in Assur. However, only in an unpublished and undated Assur document regard- ing a number of equids to be delivered to the city Ubas\u00ea do we encounter an exorcist, called Nab\u00fb- gamil(?), in connection to an actual equid.54 Although the text does not seem to describe a regular levying of horses, known from the so -called Horse Lists from Assur and Nimrud,55 it is unclear if the equid was a \"donation\".56 Furthermore, at least one tamtu divinatory question (KAR 218 = N4 no. 108) excavated in N4 concerns a white horse's suitability to pull Marduk's chariot, and even makes use of a tube (giSAG .KUD) to whisper the prayer into the ear of the horse (Lambert 2007: 80-83). This document could therefore point to a relationship between horses, the Aur temple, and exorcists.57 Nonetheless, we must imagine that ill animals were in need of care. Although a veterinarian professional not attested in the written documents could have administered such treatments, the Assur horse traditions together with the horse prescriptions inherent in the N4 collection and their place in Kiir -Aur 's training suggest that some ipus could have performed certain functions as veterinarians in 7th century Assur 's copying of texts during his amall\u00fb eru education suggests that veterinarian knowledge was as important as treatments designed for humans, even though it represents a smaller part of his textual production.58 As written veterinarian knowledge only seems to be found in Assur during the NA period, 54 Jean 2006: 176, Ass. 10804 = VAT 20401 rev. 8-10: ANE N\u00cdTA a giBAN 9 p.dPA-ga?-mil l\u00faMA.MA 10 x x TI x [x]. Assur (Schroeder 1920 no. and (Dalley Postgate 1984 : texts nos. 85, 98-118; Maul 2013: 17), perhaps to be dated to Sargon 's reign (Dalley and Postgate 1984 : 18-20). 56 High-ranking members of society occasionally made deliveries of equines to the army (Jean 2006: 176 , 183 ). 57 Kiir -Aur may later have been connected to the Aur temple, as attested by his title mama bt Aur (see Section 8.1). For exorcists in connection to horses , see also a pre- scription utilizing horse sweat in B\u00e1sckay 2018: 99, 106; Scurlock 2014: 413, 416. The text SAA 16 no. 70 concerns a horse that is possibly ill. A sales document of a field from 742 BCE excavated in the N24 archive in Assur demands that should any of the selling party 's fam- ily members file a lawsuit, they shall make various payments and \"tie two white horses at the feet of (the statue of) Aur \" (Deller et al. 1995: 126-28 no. 136; see May 2018: 73-74 and note 91). 58 See Section 3.5.2. 87 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru the fact that such knowledge was copied by Kiir -Aur attests to its impor - tance among his medical texts. The question is what purpose these prescrip - tions served. RA 15 pl. 76 improved Kiir -Aur 's repertoire of cures, yet, from the arguments put forth in Sections 3.5 and 4.2, three possible hypotheses can be established as to why Kiir -Aur acquired this knowledge related to horses, snakebites, and scorpion stings: 1) To practice veterinarian medicine. Animals in the fields were prone to be bitten or stung, and RA 15 pl. 76 was designed to heal various types of animal illnesses (bites, stings, colic).59 2) As part of a training curriculum. RA 15 pl. 76 was the 32nd(?) extract in a hypothesized row of copies and could be part of a syllabus Kiir -Aur needed to learn, regardless of its applicability.60 3) To improve Kiir -Aur 's physiological understanding of the human body, and perhaps also his knowledge of animal physiology. Kiir -Aur 's training possibly depended on a combination of these three hypotheses, although it is difficult to evaluate which focus was the most impor - tant. As suggested in Section 5.2.3, Kiir -Aur may have been in charge of treating children (prophylactically) as amall\u00fb mamau eru before becom- ing a responsible ritual supervisor, healing adults as mamau. If Kiir -Aur aided his father in healing animals during his amall\u00fb eru-phase, I cautiously suggest that he initially may have been allowed more autonomy when admin- istering treatments (perhaps under supervision) to horses and other animals before moving onto human babies. Further reasons for this suggestion are explored in Section 5.2.3. 4.3 Excursus: Animal Variants of Human Illnesses In ancient Mesopotamia, certain illness names were used to describe what were considered animal variants of human afflictions.61 Several of these names 59 However , note that animal symptoms resulting from envenomation may differ from human reactions (Al- Asmari and Al- Saif 2003: 65). 60 Bites , stings , and veterinary prescriptions appear late in the AMC lines 76-78: [... N]A! a! ANE.KUR.RA.[ME u] a GU.M[E]. The EM refers to symptoms and cleansing of the domesticated animal abodes , KAR 44 rev. 24: \" To purify the pen of cows , bulls and sheep (and) T\u00d9R (2011: 380-81) defines an ill animal by its inability to perform its duties , but he also discusses defects described in the omen series umma izbu, liver omens , injuries inflicted 88 Chapter 4 designate illnesses that resemble the symptoms observed in humans, albeit mainly in relation to externally observable symptoms. In the NA period, sheep variants of a number of human illnesses are known via Ur-ra tablet 13, including sheep -sikkatu, sheep -samnu, sheep -rapdu, and sheep -aau.62 Additionally, a \"Hip illness\" is known in cattle and sheep variants,63 and we also know sheep with \"Sick inside(s)\" , garbu, and ill lungs.64 Another illness called rnu could afflict cattle and sheep and likely caused hair loss,65 and we also know a type of mange.66 Several of these maladies seem to manifest themselves as skin disorders. Gods or demons could inflict illness upon animals as well as humans.67 Similarly, an evil afflicting an animal could likely be transferred to the owner.68 This probably gave rise to a contagion model similar to our concept on animals by their owner or others , as well as various defects inflicted on animals by humans . 62 Ur-ra tablet 13 (MSL 8/1: 10, 12) sik-[ka .NIM = sa-ma-nu 58 UDU .[S]A .AD .NIM = ditto ra-pa- du 59 UDU .[S] A.AD .GAL = ditto \u00e1-\u00e1-\u00e1-u 60 UDU .[SA ].AD .GAL = ditto ra-pa- du. Utukku- demons and samnu were considered deadly for livestock (Geller 2016: 43, 234-35; Stol 2011: 382 and note 138). Sheep -sikkatu was treated with incantations in the OB period (YOS 11 no. 7 obv. 17: KA.INIM.MA UDU .GAG .UB .BA; 159, 161 and 163- 64; see also YOS 11: 45 and no. 69). Perhaps related to sheep -aau is a type of vertigo and paralysis (Stol 2011: 384 and note 158; 167 \u00e9-gar and to UDU .\u00cdB.GIG \"Sheep Scurlock R: 191a. It was perhaps related to the human skin illness ra nu, which typically afflicted the head (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 244-45). 66 Possibly a variant of \"itching \" (SA .GU.E) named SU.GU M\u00c1.ANE (Kinnier Wilson 1962 59). 67 Gods could \"touch \" (laptu), \"hit\" (mau), Salin 2015; Stol 2011: 382 and note 136 ; van der Toorn 1985: 71. 68 An example of this from OB Mari is perhaps quoted by Stol (2011: 382 note 134). Omens could designate the outbreak (miqittu) of an epidemic among the owner 's animals (e.g ., B\u00f6ck 2000: 300-301 line 57), adding misfortune to the man. CAD (M/2: 100) lists miqittu as \"downfall, misfortune, epidemic, death \". Therefore, the misfortune of a man is an epi- demic among his animals .89 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru of \"zoonosis\" , i.e., diseases spreading from animals to humans.69 Evidence sug - gests that domesticated animals were often afflicted in herds or flocks due to their proximity.70 Therefore, we find references to epidemics and stalls,71 as well as purification rites for the pens of cattle, sheep, and horses in the healers' corpora.72 As we have already seen, horse colic (ks libbi) was also an identifiable illness. In addition to the known prescriptions, we also find plants that are described as useful against horse colic in two copies of ammu ikinu and a fragment of a \"therapeutic vademecum\".73 Why this horse disorder was one of the only animal illnesses found in the therapeutic material is uncertain, although we know that cattle and horses were considered especially important to individ- ual households. It is therefore conceivable that the owners would go to great lengths to ensure their survival.74 Only veterinarian medicine concerning horses seems to exist in the NA ther - apeutic corpus. However, the lexical traditions in particular points towards an overlap between human illnesses and their animal counterparts. As argued in Section 4.2, the relationship between veterinary and human healing in Mesopotamia seems to have been fluid. Animals were for many reasons useful to both men and gods combined, and animal metaphors as well as physiologi- cal concepts were used to describe how humans functioned.75 That animal ailments overlapped with predefined human illnesses could explain why there are so few veterinarian texts because human medicine may have been appli- cable to animals. 69 Some zoonotic diseases must have existed (e.g ., rabies , see 2001; (tarbaim), an epidemic (lipit ilim) should break out ...\" (see lines 14-17). Note a namburbi-ritual for protecting the king 's horses and troops (Caplice 1970 : 118f.; cf. Stol 2011: 383 and note 141). See also so -called \"heart -grass\" incantation (George 121-22; see Ch. 4 note 60. 72 KAR 44 rev. 24; see Ch. 4 note 60. One incantation related to 2011: 377 and note 104 with further references). For magic against field pests , see George 1999. 73 E.g., Stadhouders 2012: 3 \u00a710'; 2011: 393 , discussion of CT 14 pl. 41 (= Rm. 362 ). 74 Cattle were part of the family in the OB period and were given names (Postgate 1992: 164 and note 254 with further rerences). Horses were also valuable in the NA period (Radner 1997: 305-6). 75 E.g., Stol 2006; Foster 2002; Scurlock Watanabe 2002.90 Chapter 4 4.4 Animal and Human Physiology: The Reverse of RA 15 pl. 76 The Mesopotamians often used vague or unclear terminology regarding the organs contained in the torso and other areas of the body.76 The term libbu (\u00c0), for example, designates the heart, entrails, womb, and abdomen (belly).77 As it was probably not easy to gain knowledge of human insides, animal ana- tomical terms as well as common concepts were used to describe and meta- phorically illustrate the human innards. This section discusses some of these aspects in order to argue why a conceptual overlap between animal and human anatomy may have existed concerning how the stomach and nose were under - stood in diagnostic descriptions and treatments. Thus, this section evaluates the purpose of the reverse of RA 15 pl. 76 and provides an interpretation regard- ing Kiir -Aur 's educational use of this text. 4.4.1 Animal Anatomical Terminology As previously mentioned, animal dissection for various purposes (extispicy, butchers) or human battle wounds must have been sources for gaining knowl- edge of the insides.78 A common anatomical description, the following section, incantations and treatments used by exorcists referred to specific anatomical parts of animals . Whether such knowledge was derived visually and orally from butchers , from lexical lists (e.g the knowledge of the br\u00fb is unknown. A connection between ipu and br\u00fb in which such knowledge could have been shared is only rarely visible, but for example an exorcist named Bannu from Nimrud owned texts consisting of tamtu-prayers , which typically are considered part of the br\u00fb' s work (Koch unpublished: 10 and note 57; Koch 2015: 125-27; Lambert 2007 no. 1 and 2). For extispicy in relation to anatomy , see, see also Cohen 2016. While campaigning, many wounds were probably treated ad hoc, see Esarhaddon 's succession treaty line 643-45 (SAA 2 no. 6). Several reliefs and NA royal annals illustrate that the soldiers of conquered cities in the 7th century were occasionally flayed (e.g ., Grayson and Novotny 2012: 15-16) and hung on stakes surrounding the city (e.g ., Leichty 2011: 83). Any- one interested in anatomy would have had a chance to inspect the human body in these cases . For a discussion of experts accompanying the Assyrian army on campaigns , see Nadali and Verderame 2014. Wee (2012: 5) makes a strong case that little could be learned from repeated human dissection that could not be learned from animal dissection (see also Geller 2010: 3-4, 22 ).91 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru 152-53), was derived from a cut of meat, thereby rendering it difficult to under - stand as a demarcated description for a bodily area. Ruminant gastrointestinal physiology seems to have been relatively well known, and an incantation describes two stomachs: \"The ewe eats and it regur - gitates?, a[nd] the mouth gives (the food) to the first stomach (kar u), the first stomach to the omasum (riqtu), the omasum to the rear (arkatu). The dung falls down, and the grass receives (it)\".79 The extispicy corpus with its thorough knowledge of the insides of sheep includes even more terms: Humans only have one stomach, and it is therefore peculiar that several of these terms are also attested in human medicine.81 The human kar u can be translated as \"belly, stomach\" or even \"womb\" , depending on the context.82 In relation to animal anatomy, karu, as the rumen, and p\u00ee kari, as the closely connected reticulum, became associated with the human stomach and perhaps the opening to the stomach from the oesophagus (lower oesophageal sphincter) or the opening from the stomach to the intestines (pylorus).83 Ur-ra tablet 15 lists various readings of UZU .\u00c0 79 Cf. Stol 2006: 105-6; Starr 1983 form from the root \u00e2ru translating \"it advances to\". I understand it as a form of ar\u00fb \"to vomit\", as this makes sense in the context of ruminants \"regurgitating \" (cf. Cadelli 2000: 335-37). It was also translated as \"vomit\" by Scurlock and Andersen (2005: 117 no. 6.3). However , ar\u00fb ver- bal forms usually end in u and rarely note the first weak root in writing (cf. CAD A/2: 316). 80 Although the br\u00fb' s knowledge of the insides of sheep is typically not part of the ipu' s knowledge, there may be indications of an overlap of some anatomical knowledge. In particular , karu is also mentioned as cuts of meat for consumption (see Stol 2006: 106 note 13, 107; Bott\u00e9ro 1995: 31, 205). The karu- perhaps designating the entire stomach of ruminants - was offered to the Aur temple (SAA 7 no. 188-90, 192-94, 197-98, 200-201, 203, 206-213, 216, 219). Thus , these cuts were not known exclusively to divinatory experts . That, e.g., the karu was also known outside of specialist spheres is evident from the refer - ence of a kitchen technique called \" contorting (z\u00e2ru) Bott\u00e9ro 1995: 41: i-i-tum ka-ar-u tu-li-mu-\u00fa ta-za- ar-ma). For the relationship between and cooking, see Worthington 2003: 10-11. 81 The kukudrum is attested once in a medical context (Stol 2006: 107 and note 23). Several hemerologies prohibit eating dates on certain days or \"he will be sick of the riqtu\" (Stol 2006: 106 and note 15; see AMT 6,6 line 6 and CT 51 pl. is attested in umma izbu, but here it is an organ or part thereof (Cadelli 2000: 298 and note 62; Leichty 1970 : 163 16 line libbu, karu, qerbu , and irru, perhaps indicating a the gastrointestinal system (Cadelli 2000: 2014b: 111-19). The kar u is, however, rarely attested in the diag - nostic statements (Cadelli 2000: 298 and note 65). The p\u00ee kari, \"mouth of the kar u\" , is better attested in human medicine. It is known especially in relation to dugnu-illness and illnesses of the A LB medical text groups several illnesses according to four internal organs or anatomical areas, and here p\u00ee kari occurs as an anatomically discernable \"organ\".84 Stol (2006: 107) emphasized that this anatomical idea must have originated in animal physiology, and it is therefore peculiar that it was adopted in human physiological descriptions.85 As a result, animal anatomical terminology was employed on various occasions in both metaphor and practice to describe the human insides. This conceptual overlap between animal and human physi- ology may therefore have been useful for explaining various physiological aspects of humans. 4.4.2 Human and Equine Physiological Aspects of the Nose The mouth and nostrils are the orifices opening to the lungs and the stomach. The nose was associated with breath and life.86 The throat and neck area was called napitu, a word that can also be read as \"life, opening, air hole\" 84 Several aspects of animals and humans were compared, such as physiology , sexuality , reproduction, family , children, and death (Steinert 2012: 22-25). Animals , did not (Cooper 2009: 25-26), or intellectual abilities (Steinert 2012: 25 and notes 19-21). The ancient Mesopotamians were therefore aware of differences between humans and animals , although the anatomical and physiological similari- ties seem to have enabled an overlap . Note a mystical text in which various animals are described as the ghosts of various gods (Livingstone 1986: 83 ). 86 Although a major problem in these analyses concern the Sumerogram for nose (KIR) and mouth (KA), which are written with the same cuneiform sign and are therefore iden- tical (see for example a discussion of how to transliterate the sign in Wee 2012: 174 note 120 and 176 note 125 with references). Nonetheless , e.g., SAA 10 no. 322 states that placing tam- pons in the openings of the nostrils (naru) \" will cut off the breath \" (rev . 15-16: \u00e1-a-ru 17 i-ka -si-ir). Furthermore, several diagnoses refer specifically to the nostrils (naru) or write \"nose \" phonetically (ap -pa- \u00fa), making the examples less ambiguous (Wee 2012: 459-60 and note 66). A LB commentary also clarifies in one example that the reading is KIR and not KA (ibid.: 710). Therefore, it seems that nostrils were associated with breath in general, at least in a relaxed state. The phrase nap KIR-\u00fa DUGUD \"breathing of his nose is difficult\" (ibid.: 711 note 3') indirectly demonstrates this as well. Stol (2000: 198) noted a distinction in relation to fluids from KA (nad\u00fb \"thrown, ejected\") or KIR (alku \"flow \"). In the OB recension of the Gilgame Epic, Enkidu' s wake lasts seven days and nights \"until a maggot dropped from his nostril\" (George Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru and is find the formulation r appi \"wind of the nose\" associated with breath.88 Therefore, the diagnostic literature associated breath with the nose, although this may be more of an idiom than actual conceptualization.89 Perhaps because of the nose's relationship to life, nosebleed treatment was considered a particular skill.90 Unfortunately, it is difficult to evaluate if the Mesopotamians were aware of the epiglottis' function of directing food into the oesophagus.91 In general, breathing through the nose seems to have reflected a healthy state.92 It is therefore interesting that \"wind\" (ru) was also perceived as an agent that could inflict illness.93 87 Etymologically , napitu is derived from napu \"to breathe freely to rest, to expand, to become abundant\" (CAD N/1: 288). 88 See Steinert 2012: 275 and note 19. Sa-gig tablet 6 was concerned with the nose and nos- trils, and herein we find that a blocked nose with breath coming out the mouth or breath violently drawn from the nose leads to death (Scurlock 2014: 53; Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 590-92; TDP: becomes rapid (lit.: jumps) and his insides are continually cramped, he will die. If his breath becomes rapid (lit.: jumps) and his ' strings' are tense, he will die. If his breath throbs and comes closely spaced, he will [d]ie \" (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 340). TDP: 54 line 4b: DI KIR-\u00fa BAD .BAD -ir GAM \"if his nose is completely blocked off, he will die\" and TDP: 82 line 24: DI ... PA.AN . BI ina KIR-\u00fa DAB .DAB GIG BI NU DIN \"if ... his breath is 'seized' in his nose, that patient will not get well\" (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 537). TDP: 56 line 32 may read: DI IM KIR-\u00fa ina KA -\u00fa \u00c8-a ... \"If his breath (r appi) is ' seized' in his mouth ...\". 89 In prescriptions , \"heavy \" (kabtu/DUGUD) could describe both the nose and mouth due to the reading of the Sumerogram, see Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 206 no. 9.118 with references . Note Sa-gig tablet 3 line 63: \"his breath is seized in his nose so that he makes his breath go out through his mouth, it will make death mount to this throat [...], na-pi- is-su 15, 21; For such treatments , see Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 207, 539. 91 The epiglottis is located around the uppermost part of the larynx. Note Sa-gig tablet 9 line 62: \"If ... his breaths have become short (and) his breath constantly enters his throat as if he were thirsting for water ...\" , DI 1951: 76). Here breath and water goes down the throat. In RA 40 pl. 116 obv. 8, we find the description \" windpipe \" (GI.G\u00cdD MUR. ME -\u00fa; CAD E: 137-38), which may attest to the knowledge that the trachea differed from the oesophagus in the throat, although this description of the \" windpipe \" is mainly attested in connection to coughs (CAD E: 138 ). 92 Wee 2012: 468-69 the NA letter ABL 771 obv. 6-7 in which the king places a \"Plant of Life \" at the nostrils (Selz 2014: 658). 93 B\u00f6ck 2014a: 36-37 and 2010: 94-95; Cadelli 2000: 345-46. Winds could also be indicative of good or bad fortune in relation to astrological omens , 94 Chapter 4 Only one clearly defined illness attacked both the nostrils and mouth together, namely bunu.94 The illnesses treated through the nostrils, however, include bunu,95 \"Ill lungs\" ,96 sulu,97 and a\u00fb.98 In general, the nostrils are rarely used during healing, but aside from some examples related to human ill- ness, one good example is for horses with colic to ensure ingestion (CAD N/1: 137 with references; see Section 4.4.3). Horses are obligate nasal breathers, i.e., they breathe through their noses (Holcombe et al. 2007: 454-455). Notably, horses display symptoms such as pain through a variety of facial expressions, which importantly include dilated nostrils (Gleerup et al. 2015: 103, 109, 113; Ashley et al. 2005: 566). As a result, a horse's state of illness could in several instances be evaluated via the nostrils, with the metaphoric relationship between breath and life. This is discussed further below. The lungs were associated with wind and the connecting windpipe.99 Pecu- liarly, lungs may have been considered related to the digestion of food in con- nection to eating and drinking bewitched foodstuffs.100 While it is difficult to envision how the Mesopotamians conceptualized something other than air going into the lungs and moving into the gastrointestinal system, it should be see Rochberg 1988: 57-60. The female south wind had an evil aspect, and was associ- ated with, e.g., Pazuzu was linked with a positive aspect of wind and became an apotropaic protector against 15'-16', 69 note 18, 145-46.

This was perhaps connected to the presence of \"phlegm, foam \" ruputu (\u00da) in relation to certain lung and epigastric illnesses , which were associ- ated with witchcraft 149-50; Geller 2007a: 196 note 36).95 Training in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru noted that the kidneys are also anatomically disconnected from the digestive tract, but were still recognized as linked to urine (see Geller 2005: 1-2; Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 104; Geller and Cohen 1995). Perhaps a magical compo - nent of bewitched food could be explained through the manner in which the gods receive the offering in Atra -ass , namely via smell.101 Thus, the nose appears to have been the principal breathing orifice that was considered a marker for a healthy (perhaps relaxed) state for both humans and horses. Breath was associated with wind and the throat, as well as with the lungs. Furthermore, bewitched foodstuff was related to both the lungs and areas of the epigastrium. 4.4.3 Discussion of the Veterinarian Prescriptions on RA 15 pl. 76 Kiir -Aur dealt with veterinarian knowledge in his amall\u00fb eru manu- script RA 15 pl. 76. In the two horse treatments, a particular tube (DUG ziriqi), comparable to a \"feeding tube\" , was used for reaching down the oesophagus to administer solutions to a horse, presumably with colic, through its nose.102 A similar method of administering a medicament was encountered in 101 However , only divine beings received offerings like this. Lambert and Millard 1969: 98-99, 3rd tablet col. iv 34-36: \"[The gods sniffed] the smell, they gathered [like flies] over the offering . [After] they See also , e.g., the end of Itar 's Descent to the Netherworld (Lapinkivi 2010: 22, 28, 33) line 138: \"Let the dead come up and smell the incense \", BA.\u00da.ME li-lu-nim-ma qut-ri-in li-i-i-nu (see Foster 1996: 408), and the Erra Epic (Cagni 1969: 126-29) lines 49-50: \"In the sanctuary of the god who honours this poem may abundance accumulate, but let the one who neglects it never smell incense \", DINGIR with \"insence (offering)\" (qutrnu), see CAD Z: 106. Maybe this is why some of the treatments for the nostrils men- tioned above also utilized fumigation, as this would be directed towards the lungs (see CAD N/1: 137 for examples). However , witchcraft texts generally mention that a patient has ingested or imbibed bewitched food or drink, and not as such smelled it. Yet, the two aspects of consuming foodstuff may not be mutually exclusive, as most people will smell as well as eat/drink their food. The relationship between foodstuff, fumigation, and the divine world requires further investigation in relation to medicine. 102 RA 15 pl. 76 rev. 1'-4', 5'-8'; Stol (Z: 134) interprets it as a sort of Soden as \"Ton-pipette \" (AHw: 1532), and translates it as \"...-R\u00f6hre \". The DUG designates it as a clay object comparable to various fluid containers (ibid.: 401 and note 256). Stol stresses the uniqueness of the instrument, as this is the only example (cf. BAM 159 discussed in Parys 2014: 23 and B\u00f6ck 2009a: 117 and notes 56-57). This method for treating horses and especially colic is also attested in the Ugaritic hippiatric texts (Cohen and Sivan 1983 : 9-10, 16-17 with references) and the method is still applied today (e.g ., Lopes et al. 2004: -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase copy RA 40 pl. 116. In this text, Kiir -Aur treats various cough afflictions (sulu) associated with the \"windpipe\" (GI. G\u00cdD MUR.ME) by trickling a fluid onto the tongue and pouring it into the nostrils with a takkussu-pipette, in addition to drinking a potion to induce vomiting.103 Thus, Kiir -Aur acquired knowledge about administering medi- caments through the nose and possibly also anatomical insight into the func- tions of the throat, lungs, and stomach. As previously stated, only four NA prescriptions are known for treating horses, all from N4 (BAM 159, RA 15 pl. 76), of which three specify pouring the fluid into the \"left nostril\".104 Stol noted that flushing ingredients through the left nostril over the right nostril must be considered an irrational practice only attested in veterinary treatments (Stol 2011: 392).105 However, the mention of right and left nostrils also occurs in umma izbu in relation to the features of human foetuses: \"If a woman gives birth, and (the child) has no left nostril; (the child) is endowed with happiness\".106 A similar nostril distinction occurs among symptoms observed in babies in Sa-gig: \"If the air of an infant's right 'nostril' gets cold and that of the left gets hot, 'Hand' of Lamatu\".107 In general, the various omen series tend to focus on positive and negative omens, where the interpretation depended on different schemata such as right/left as favourable/unfavourable, and they frequently incorporate impos - sible phenomena.108 As such, they function as artificial constructs and cannot 103 RA 40 pl. 116 ovb. G\u00d9B 105 This is echoed in the descriptions of plants for horse ks libbi in ammu ikinu poured into the horse 2012: 3 26-27 ms C \u00a710'). 106 Leichty 1970 : 57 tablet 3 lines 29-32 (the line quoted is 31): BE MUNUS \u00d9.TU-ma (cf. 2005: 396-97). See most recently De Zorzi (2011: 59), who emphasized obstructions of orifices as a general negative omen in umma izbu. 107 Scurlock 2014: 260, right/left opposition as favourable/unfavourable is reversed, as the observations concern malformation. A malformation on the right side makes it an unfavourable omen Leichty in Anatomy and Physiology as amall\u00fb eru always be taken as representative of actual occurrences or their frequency. However, the focus on nostrils is noteworthy in connection to the discussion of infants and horses. Furthermore, infants appear generally to be nasal breathers like horses (Bergeson and Shaw 2001; see Section 5.2.2). As discussed above, horses externalize their pain, such as that experienced by colic,109 especially through the facial features. Infants can also suffer from infantile colic (Hyman et al. 2006; Wessel et al. 1954), and among the symp - toms are irritability, compulsive crying, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.110 Interestingly, both horses and infants would have been unable to communicate their symptoms properly, and therefore other indicators were needed to diagnose the problems. Thus, breathing through the nose by horses and infants, or the lack of breathing (e.g., children screaming), was indicative of possible problematic physiological states. Digestive problems, such as ks libbi in horses, could be treated through their noses. In addition to the advantage of administering a potion to an animal that would otherwise not have imbibed it, there may be a metaphoric relation- ship between ks libbi and the nose. As breath (or life) seems to be linked to the nose, this could explain why one could treat the physical and (in humans) emotional effects of ks libbi via the flaring nostrils of a hose. The horse would look emotionally disturbed, which would add to the diagnosis of ks libbi. Regardless, it seems that knowledge about the function of the oesophagus and trachea was difficult to gain, and, by exposing Kiir -Aur to these vet - erinarian as well as human treatments with pipettes, he would have learned about these physiological areas. An overlap may have existed between human and animal physiology in terms of the nose and breath. Kiir -Aur could therefore have been introduced to the underlying physiological conceptions and the possible focus on the nose as a health indicator in animals and at least babies when he was amall\u00fb eru. 4.5 Summary The manuscript RA 15 pl. 76 was examined due to its unexpected content, fol- lowing the microhistoric approach seeking to solve such mysteries. The tablet illustrates that the treatments of snakebites and scorpion stings and veteri- narian knowledge played a role in Kiir -Aur 's education. Snake and scorpion 109 For one definition of horse colic, see Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2002: 650. 110 Such problems were also mentioned in the 40th tablet of Sa-gig (Volk 1999: 13; Cadelli 1997: 12-13, 26, 29). See Section 5.2.2.98 Chapter 4 venom were probably used for illustrating many bodily processes. The effects of potent venom would demonstrate most bodily functions to a student, and, as such, the concept was terrifying as well as an exemplar in relation to the human body. In general, snake and scorpion venom was used metaphorically to explain the power of various illnesses. As a result, various analogies and lexi- cal overlaps existed between venom, bile in mammals, and saliva in relation to witchcraft. These overlaps drew on the power of venom to explain how these other fluids functioned to regulate and problematize various bodily processes. Although veterinarian prescriptions appear infrequently, the city of Assur had several written traditions linked to knowledge about horses. Kiir -Aur may have made use of these to treat animals. This chapter suggests that Kiir -Aur used methods of treatment via the nose to acquire knowledge about human physiology from horses, as well as perhaps to treat ill animals himself. The overlap of some treatments and illnesses between animals and humans supports this proposal. Human internal organs and processes were not properly understood in the ancient world, due to a lack of knowledge about the insides and a partial inability to use this knowledge in medical practice. It is therefore likely that animal physiology was occasionally used to explain human bodily processes. One aspect of basic bodily experience used was the relationship between the nose and breath in horses and children, who were unable to verbally commu- nicate their symptoms. Furthermore, breathing through the nose indicated a healthy state for adults as well (see Ch. 4 notes 86-88). Kiir -Aur 's treatments related to the nose would also have improved his understanding of the throat, lungs, and stomach during examination and healing, thereby improving his physiological understanding.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 006 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.Chapter 5 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau eru This chapter discusses the limited material that exists from Kiir -Aur 's ehru phases to provide an overview of what is currently known about these intermediate phases of his training. Furthermore, a text related to calming an infant or a child from Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb mamau eru- phase is used to suggest that he acquired healing competences related to children. This chapter therefore discusses Kiir - Aur 's possible involvement in healing infants and considers the general theories on infant and child healing in relation to Kiir -Aur 's previous tab - lets. Texts from Kiir -Aur 's nephew, Kiir -Nab\u00fb, are used to contextualize Kiir 's tablets labelled as uiltus are also discussed in general. Additionally, this chapter examines Kiir -Aur 's use of the phrase \"(he) whose trust is Nab\u00fb\" (a Nab\u00fb tuklasssu) in colophons from his amall\u00fb eru and amall\u00fb mamau eru phases, as well as on tablets without titles. This facilitates the distribution of a few tablets without titles onto Kiir -Aur 's apprentice career phases. 5.1 The \"apprentice\" (Maul 2010: 208 and note 67). The phase is unfortunately only attested by two texts, of which one is unpublished. What follows presents the relevant tablets and their content in order to facilitate a cautious discussion of the manuscripts in relation to Kiir -Aur 's career. The texts are listed in the table below. KAL 10 no. 4 is a large tablet with an introductory diagnostic statement as well as a multitude of incantations and brief instructions directed at releas - ing a \"Curse\" (rev. 46: [KA.INI]M.MA NAM.\u00c9[RIM.B\u00daR]. RU.DA 100 Chapter 5 colophon the writing l\u00faam-lu-\u00fa for the title amall\u00fb (rev. 48).1 The text ends with a curse: \"[He who] carries off th[is tablet], may the gods of heaven and earth ta[ke away] his eye(sight)\".2 The unpublished text N4 no. 175 outlines parts of the ritual known as bt mseri \"the house of confinement\" (Borger 1974; see also ibid. 1994). As shown in the detailed discussion of this ritual in Section 6.3.2, bt mseri made use of a number of figurines and drawings alongside incantations and ritual actions, in order to rid a patient and his house of demons no. 175 indi- cates that the ritual was somehow connected to the ritual action of \"rubbing\" (muuu, rev. 6; see also B\u00f6ck 2007; ibid. 2003). In the colophon, an erased line 1 Such a spelling is not attested in Kiir -Aur 's other tablets with titles composed of the word amall\u00fb (eru/mamau eru). However, the abbreviated form is attested elsewhere in Assur and uzirina (e.g., Fadhil 2012: 55; Hunger in rev. 48 for bari \"checked\" , which is otherwise only attested in Kiir -Aur 's N4 no. 224 from an uncertain phase of his career.Table 6 Texts assigned to Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb-phase Text Content Format and designation KAL 10 no. 4 Obverse and reverse: a diagnostic statement and ritual brief instructions (obv. 34-35, 56, rev. 21, 31, 38, 45) all against a \"Curse\" (mmtu) (rev. 46)Portrait; uppu N4 no. 175a Obverse and reverse: instructions for sections of the bt mseri ritual (obv. 1-rev . 7, rev. 8-17) with at least 15 incantation incipits preserved and associated brief ritual instructions (obv. 15, 17, 19, 26, 37(?), 39, 41, 43, 45, 52, rev. 3, 9, 14, 15, 16)Portrait; uiltu a Kiir -Aur 's title is preserved in rev. 19 as l\u00faAB .T[UR]. Seeing as the line is not tightly writ - ten, there is no reason to assume further signs should be reconstructed, although the side of the tablet is broken and it could technically have held l\u00faAB .T[UR TUR].101 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau eru between rev. 18 and 19 still has ID-nu legible, and the line may once have held additional instructions. In N4 no. 175 Kiir -Aur 's name is written pZ\u00da.KEDA -da-ur, which is oth- erwise only attested in BAM 121 from an uncertain phase (see Sections 5.4 and 7.2.1). Furthermore, he copied his father Nab\u00fb-bssunu's title mama bt Aur with a Babylonian form of the sign \u00c9, possibly indicating that Kiir -Aur was trained in Babylonian sign forms.3 The tablet was also described as \"quickly extracted for his (own) 'reading'\".4 In this context, the word tmartu reading\" (CAD and it must be con- sidered a technical term related to knowledge acquisition, although the exact nuances are not clear (see Robson 2019: 124 and note 134, 136-138). However, 175 is the only tablet among Kiir -Aur 's manuscripts with this phrase (cf. ACh Supp. 2 24 in Section 7.6). By compari- son, Kiir -Nab\u00fb copied at least three tablets \"for his (own) 'reading'\" , and these are all commentaries.5 The colophon of N4 no. 175 ends with a warning to the reader: \"He who carries (the tablet) off, wherever he lifts his hands to (praise) Nab\u00fb, let him (i.e. Nab\u00fb) not hear his prayer, [he who fea]rs Nab\u00fb and Marduk shall not erase my written name!\".6 Both Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb-phase tablets contain portions of two types of rituals, which were integral to the ipu's profession according to the EM (Geller 2018b; ibid. 2000). The manuscripts indicate that Kiir -Aur as a amall\u00fb focused on acquiring further ritual means to treat a so -called \"Curse\" , possibly as a cause of illness, as well as gaining an insight into how the impor - tant demarcation ritual bt mseri was performed. The latter observation is supported by the addition of the phrase \"for his 'reading'\" in the colophon. Overviews of rituals slightly similar in form to N4 no. 175, although with dif- ferent aims, are otherwise found during Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase (KAR 298) and on a tablet without a title (KAL 10 no. 1). Presumably, Kiir -Aur 's two amall\u00fb tablets enabled Kiir -Aur to apply ritual treatments towards \"Curse\" as a cause of illness and aid in preparing or performing the bt mseri ritual. 3 The \u00c9 in Nab\u00fb-bssunu's title mama bt Aur was also written with a Babylonian form of the sign in N4 no. 241, copied on behalf of Kiir -Aur as a amall\u00fb eru (Section 3.7.3). Note also the Babylonian form of the sign L\u00da in the colophon of BAM 28 (see Ch. 8 note 18). 4 Rev. 22: ana IGI.DU.A-\u00fa a-an-i is-su-a. 5 AfO Tummu btu and urpu tablet 2 (CCP 2.1.C); N4 no. 163 (ana IGI.L\u00c1-\u00fa), a commentary on Marduk's Address to the Demons (CCP 2.2.1.A.a); N4 no. 220 (ana a-ma-ri-\u00fa), a commentary on Tummu Maql\u00fb tab - lets 1-2 (CCP 2.1.A). -Nab\u00fb also three terminology: BAM 52 (malstu), BAM 106 (malstu) amall\u00fb eru-phase Kiir -Aur became a \"junior apprentice exorcist\". Previous research has not been able to differentiate these phases beyond the change in titles.7 Due to the meagre amall\u00fb evidence presented above, doing so remains difficult. Regardless, it is still possible to present some observations in relation to the available evidence. Kiir -Aur only copied three preserved texts during his amall\u00fb mamau eru-phase, and these are presented in the table below: Table 7 Texts assigned to Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb mamau eru-phase Text Content Format and designation LKA 89+LKA 90 Obverse and reverse (col. i-iv): diagnostic statement(?)

LKA 141 Obverse and Lamatu (obv. 1-rev. 15) with a rubric stating it was a child\" (rev. 16: L\u00da .TUR.UN .G\u00c1 )Landscape; IM.G\u00cdD .DA a According to the most recent copy by Farber (1989: pl. 13), Kiir -Aur was mamau eru (MA.MA TUR) when he copied this text. However, recent collations by Daniel Schwemer (personal communication) revealed the writing \u00c1MAN .L\u00c1 in a smaller script underneath his title. This addition indicates Kiir -Aur was amall\u00fb mamau eru when the tablet was E.g., 2014, 2011a; 89+ two -columned tablet with incantations and ritual instruc- tions against ghostly afflictions.8 These instructions aimed to free the patient of a ghost and to banish it to the netherworld, taking the generic \"Any Evil\" (mimma lemnu) with it.9 Ghosts were regularly treated in Kiir -Aur 's texts, and he had previously treated the effects of these to some degree in the amall\u00fb eru manuscript N4 no. 237 and the presumed amall\u00fb eru tablet BAM 9. Interestingly, LKA 89+ is described as an extract, although it is a library copy (multi- columned).10 The reason for this discrepancy could stem from the text having been copied from a writing -board and originally having been part of an even bigger text. It is therefore possible that the nisu label could describe both multi- columned tablets as well as brief extracts in N4.11 As a result, it can be difficult to establish what purpose a text served after its immediate use in the N4 collection. The multi- columned format could perhaps indicate a wish to keep the text for reference in the library afterwards,12 although in the case 8 For the most recent edition and copy, see CMAwR 2: 189ff. text 8.25 ms B; see also join between LKA 89+ and LKA 90 was previously noted by Peders\u00e9n 1986: 72 no. 523; see also Verderame 2002: 76-77. The removal of mimma lemnu is also frequently stressed in the Itar - Dumuzi incantation rituals (Farber 1977: 9). Ghost rituals were also used in, e.g., bt rimki and the New Year festival, and were therefore not exclusively related to healing, but also stately or royal rituals (see Ambos 2013a: 52, 57ff., 201ff.; Scurlock 1988a: 127). Large parts of the row of entries and content are duplicated in the multi- columned KAR 227 (= N4 no. 88) written without a colophon. However, the end of LKA 89+ col. iv cannot be found on KAR 227. Although large parts of LKA 89+ are broken and cannot be assessed, the dif- ferences observed are on the reverse in col. iii of both examples, where the incantation in KAR 227 col. iii 8'-24' is duplicated in LKA 89+ col. iii 2'-17'. The LKA 89+ entry opens with \u00c9N, which is not written in KAR 227. Furthermore, LKA 89+ col. iii 17' and the small instruction in 18' were divided onto two lines each in KAR 227 col. iii 13'-14' and 15'-16'. 10 LKA 89+ col. iv 9': [(x) x x x x x x]x na-as-a. Presumably, the line read ani or zamar before, but the line ends with nasa written very tightly, and likely more than three signs were originally on the line. It is therefore difficult to account for so many broken signs without considering that the line originally contained another statement, such as a purpose statement (ana abt epi; see KAR 374 rev. 21; LKA 157 col. iv 12'). Such state - ments are argued in Section 7.4 to occur around the mamau-phase. However, other texts only contain the ani nasu statement on the last line, although the lines could easily hold more signs (BAM 81 rev. 18'; BAM 186 rev. 34; 15; cf. BAM 333 rev. 4'). LKA 89+ is said to be \"written and checked according to its original\" , LKA 89+ col. iv 5': LIBIR.RA.BI.GIM AB .SAR b\u00e0-r\u00ec. 11 It is unclear if nasu always designates extracts in N4, or if the verb could be used to designate a copy (cf. Black 1985). 12 This suggestion is built on the assumption that such formats normally served such purposes. However, this cannot be substantiated, although this was likely the case at Nineveh. Robson (2014: 146-47) has shown that this collection was in fact atypical in 104 Chapter 5 of LKA 89+, the format may simply imply that Kiir -Aur needed to copy out more text than what could be copied onto a single columned format tablet. LKA 141 contains at least two prayers and accompanying ritual instructions (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 73 no. 543), which concern one(?) ritual for reconciling a man with the god (or goddess) of his house (Ebeling 1953a: XIII).13 N4 no. 24 was designated as calm a child\" (KA.INIM.MA L\u00da.TUR UN .G\u00c1 .KE).14 The term translated as \"child\" here, eru or erru, can also designate a baby or an infant (see Farber 1989: 132-36). The incantation revolves around the demoness Lamatu and therefore does not contain typical lullaby -like child calming motifs (e.g., Farber 1990a). Instead, it describes how Lamatu stalks around a house and among the domesticated animals, luring the children to her venomous teats (Farber 2014: 301; Wiggermann 2000: 231 and note 93). The unsettling fear established by the crying of an infant her - alded the presence of Lamatu (ibid.: 237; Cadelli 1997: 26), and the family's ancestors and domestic cult could be severely disturbed by children crying (Stol 2000: 212-13; van der Toorn 1996: 18-19, 121, 125). Lamatu was the daughter of Anu, she killed babies by posing as a midwife and was formally installed by the gods to keep population growth in check (Wiggermann 2000: 224-25). She preferably attacked babies and pregnant women by causing a number of symptoms (e.g., fever, intestinal problems, red rash) related to other illnesses (e.g., jaundice, paittu) potentially leading to death (Wiggermann 2000: 236-39; Stol 2000: 210). Problems during pregnancy and birth as well as protecting and curing ill babies were all part of iptu, and these areas are therefore expected to appear during the training of exorcists.15 The themes encountered during this particular level of education appear to revolve around the cult of the house, i.e., the family cult, the personal deities attached to a house as well as calming infants crying, and how to appease and several ways. In general, good copies could have been kept as library copies to replace older tablets in worse condition, although this would not necessarily depend on format (Clancier 2014: 46). 13 LKA 141 rev. the only instance where Kiir -Aur writes the divine element of his father, Nab\u00fb-bssunu's name phonetically: na-bi-um. However, the spelling is peculiar. The tab - let remains unedited. 14 Farber 1989: 102-107 ms L, pl. 13; Farber specifies that such incantations could serve to calm a crying child, to heal an ill child or to protect a child from dangers prophylactically (ibid.: 3; George 1993b; cf. van a is unclean Woman not able to give birth, travailing woman in difficulty because of Lamatu, (incan- tations) to calm a child\".105 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau eru remove the evils induced by the divinities' dissatisfaction with the inhabitants. Apart from the possible uses to treat the cause behind an illness,16 reconciling a man with his god and treating ghosts as causes of domestic troubles implies that something could upset a household's various deities. In the first half of the second millennium, crying children were notorious for disturbing the peace of the family, as well as the domestic cult (van der Toorn 1996: 120-21, 125-28; cf. Farber 1989: 1-4; Farber 1990a), and sleeping or resting gods evidently con- sidered noise a disturbance.17 With N4 no. 24, Kiir -Aur became able to calm a child and prophylactically keep Lamatu at bay while ensuring that domes - tic cultic aggravation, which he also learned to handle as amall\u00fb mamau eru, was less prone to happen. Although one can only consider this evidence tentative, Kiir -Aur appears to have learned these genres in order to remove domestic misfortune and pos - sible sources of illness. Exorcistic healing of illness appears to have involved a dual approach by ritually soothing the anger of the divine cause and providing a physical treatment (Hee\u00dfel 2000: -Aur may therefore have focused his attention on the latter during his amall\u00fb eru-phase in particular, whereas especially the amall\u00fb mamau eru-phase could have focused on soothing (possible) causes of ill- ness. As stated above, it is unknown if the rituals were learned in order to treat possible estranged divinities before illness, or as a dual approach while healing illness. Furthermore, as argued in the following sections, N4 no. 24 may inidi- cate that Kiir -Aur pediatric duties mamau eru-phase. 5.2.1 The Child Calming Incantation Duplicates Kiir -Aur 's 's N4 Kiir -Nab\u00fb produced his copy as mamau and included a ritual.18 N4 no. 24 contains no ritual instruction and deals explicitly with Lamatu and is intended to calm a child, whereas the 16 Koch unpublished: 11 and note 1990a: 146-47. A frequently cited example is the motif of noise in Atra -ass causing Enlil to become so angry it results in the flood (Lambert and Millard 1969). Michalowski (1990: 385-89) argues that the in mythological narratives \"establishes a privi- leged position for the concept of creation, activity, independence\" , which in Atram-ass asserts humanity as \"an independent, creative being\" (ibid.: 389). Therefore, he does not regard noise as a literal mark of overpopulation. See also Machinist 1983 for noise as a motif in the Erra Epic. 18 N4 no. 247; see Farber 2014: 12; cf. Chapter 5 ritual instruction in Kiir -Nab\u00fb's N4 no. 247 indicates that the purpose was to keep the child safe by applying ingredients to the child to keep Lamatu, as well as \"Any 's N4 no. 24 contains a tablet designation, his name, and a title. The tablet is labelled as an IM.G\u00cdD .DA (lit.: \"Long tablet\"), a label interpreted in other studies as an exercise (see Ch. 6 notes 4-5). In comparison, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's N4 no. 247 was categorized as an uiltu, perhaps indi- cating an obligation of some sort (see Section 5.3.2). N4 no. 247 was copied when Kiir -Nab\u00fb was mamau, and it was copied according to a Nineveh(?) writing -board copied from Nippur.20 Kiir -Aur provided no copying state - ment for his content in N4 no. 24. Kiir -Nab\u00fb's N4 no. 247 contains several Assyrianisms not present in Kiir -Aur 's duplicate, despite N4 no. 247 being copied from an alleged Babylonian original (Farber 1989: 103, 105; cf. Farber 2014: 210). Other minor differences in choice of spellings and line division are present in N4 no. 24 and N4 no. 247, although it is currently unclear if the alterations stem from differing recensions (Farber 1989: 103-7). One example of such differences between the texts is: N4 no. 247 obv. 2 The later Babylonian duplicate LKU 32 also shares features with both N4 no. 24,21 as well as N4 no. 247.22 Thus, it is unclear how many recensions these three texts represent. Notably, the IM.G\u00cdD .DA BAM 102 copied by Kiir -Aur 19 Cf. Farber 2014: 220). incantation is MA.MA DUMU p.dPA-b[e-...]. Mainly choice of words and writings, example: N4 no. 24 obv. that Assyrianisms not present in the Assur 'version'\" , which is presumably represented by N4 no. 24. However, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's N4 no. 247 also contains Assyrianisms (Farber 1989: 103). 22 Especially the ritual instruction. LKU 32 also contains at least three other associated incantations and ritual instructions.107 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau eru as mamau is largely similar in structure to N4 no. 24, i.e., only an incantation and an explicit statement about not having written a ritual, which could indi- cate that Kiir -Aur was practicing certain shorter incantations for a specific purpose during these phases (see also the amall\u00fb eru manuscript N4 A 400). Comparably, his father Nab\u00fb-bssunu copied KAL 4 no. 6 as mamau eru, and this tablet likely only contained a single prayer related to a namburbi-ritual. 5.2.2 Excursus: Paediatricians and Treatments Unlike veterinarians, no titles are known for ancient paediatricians, but only for midwives.23 Nevertheless, the exorcist was involved in assessing the physi- ognomy of humans in general, as well as providing prophylactic or therapeu- tic treatment of children.24 The 40th tablet of Sa- gig attests to 112 diagnoses of child symptoms (Volk 1999: 13; Cadelli 1997: 12-13).25 The most dominant among the problems diagnosed are behavioural problems, such as the ones presumably treated by N4 no. 24, and digestive disorders such as colic (Cadelli 1997: 26, 29).26 Although age is rarely specified, the entries may often concern newborns as well as babies (Cadelli 1997: 13). Already during pregnancy, Lamatu and witchcraft could pose a threat to the unborn child (Cadelli 1997: 15). Some demonic beings could even be born with the child, such as Lugal-urra or ulpaea (Cadelli 1997: 15; a scattered house (Volk 1999: 18 note 108). Cramps associated with epilepsy were particularly ominous (ibid.: 16-17; Cadelli 1997: 23-24). These symptoms could foreshadow a fatal end for mother, father or the entire household (Volk 1999: 17 and note 102; Stol 1993: 89).27 Jaundice (azu in 23 OB Mari was probably famous as a centre for healing child illnesses (Volk 1999: 29-30 and notes 179-80 with references). However, the exorcist is advised not to see the mother for a duration of one month after birth (Stol 2000: 206). Note that at least one incipit related to birth is only attested in the N4 text collection (Steinert 2018d: 272; N4 no. 167). 25 The general writing is L\u00da .TUR for \"baby, newborn, infant, child\" , which can be read erru, the more literary la \u00fb/lak\u00fb, or the common designation for a child eru (Stol 2000: 176; cf. Volk 1999: 12 note 73 with references to discussion). 26 Infant colic can present itself as a regular occurring emotional response involving crying, screaming and occasional difficulty in breathing because of the \"fussing\" , combined with physical manifestations such as stomach pains, regurgitation and diarrhoea (Hyman et al. 2006: 1522-1523; Wessel et al. 1954). 27 See also Sa-gig tablet 29, in which various ominous portents are specified if a child is born with Antaubba or ulpaea or if these demons fall on a child during various periods of the child's life (Scurlock 2014: 219-220; Hee\u00dfel 2000: 318-338).108 Chapter 5 tablet 40), which could signal the presence of Lamatu in children,28 was also considered ominous, and the birth of a yellow child heralded the death of the owner of the house.29 Some physical symptoms could therefore herald the destruction of a house - hold. Treatments safeguarding the household and keeping it in balance were essential, and such purposes seem to correspond to Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb mamau eru texts and large parts of his mamau texts concerning, e.g., namburbi-rituals (see Sections 5.2 and 6.4). Little is known about what therapeutic treatments for diseases were applied to babies.30 The best information stems from the NA royal correspondence,31 although we often find only brief remarks that a child is doing well.32 Nontheless, some exorcists practicing at the contemporary NA royal court at Nineveh, may been involved in observing and healing infants or children in addition to adults (e.g., Parpola 1993 nos. 213-215, 218, 302, 305). Volk (1999: 11) regarded it as a chance of discovery that child treatments are so poorly docu- mented in medical literature. However, child healing is not listed as an identifi- able category in the AMC.33 Nonetheless, many illness diagnoses for children are attested in \"adult\" ver - sions (Cadelli 1997: 32). It is therefore plausible, although impossible to prove, that at least older children received the same (modified) treatments as adults 28 Lamatu was known as \"the goddess who (makes) his face yellow\" ul-t\u00fa a IGI-\u00fa SIG (Volk 1999: 24 \"If a woman gives birth, and at the birth (the child) is already fully yellow (Leichty: flecked with green (spots)) - the owner of the house will die.\" 30 For boy's problems, see George 2016: 167-68. Note BAM 248 col. iv 39-43 with prophylac- tic treatments for keeping \"hands\" of various deities from approaching infants (Scurlock 2014: 626ff.). (ibid.: 621) furthermore states: \"Treatments specifically and exclu- sively designed for infants or toddlers are relatively rare and usually scattered among pre - scriptions for adults with similar problems.\" For additional examples of treatments for adults or children, as well as cures exclusively for children, see Steinert 2018d: 228. 31 Volk 1999: 8. Letters mentioning children's health, regardless of age and description: SAA 10 no. 187, 193, 194, 196, 197, 202, 213, 214, 215(?), 217, 218, 219, 222, 223, 231, 238, 239, 244, 245, 247, 293, 296, 298, 299, 300(?), 301, 302, 304(?), 305, 306(?), 309, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323. 32 The evidence from the antechamber to the third NA tomb at Nimrud showed several individuals ranging 6-12 years of age, a fully grown foetus (8th-9th lunar month), and a baby (3-9 months) (Macgregor 2012: 81; M\u00fcller -Karpe et al. 2008: 144). Although these individuals must date to the 8th century, it is uncertain whether or not these were royal children. 33 Apart from pregnancy and birth which occur near the end of the AMC, the best candidate is an earlier entry in line 98: [...] 33 note 159).34 A human adult treatment was perhaps also modified into at least one horse prescription in BAM 159 (Stol 2011: 395 and note 223; cf. B\u00f6ck 2009a: 117-18). I would also like to emphasize the recent findings by Hee\u00dfel (2006: 19-20) concerning the possible lack of differences between the treat - ment of men and women in major parts of the first 35 tablets of Sa- gig. This could indicate that the diagnostic and therapeutic corpora may not always have been applied exclusively to the identified gender, even species, and per - haps also age group. In relation to horses in particular, it is noteworthy that they and children are prone to nasal breathing and regurgitation (Section 4.4.2).35 Furthermore, gastro -intestinal disorders are regularly observed in both horses and infants (Hyman et al. 2006: 1519; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2002: 643). This may indicate an over - lap in physiological conception, and due to the possible physiological knowl- edge taught to Kiir -Aur as amall\u00fb eru concerning horses, we can perhaps hypothesize an overlap between some child and horse illnesses, and maybe adult treatments for similar problems.36 34 The AMC may indicate that conditions occurring in both children and adults were inte - grated into the adult sections of such medical texts, e.g., AMC line 23 adds \u00e1 L\u00da.TUR and (Steinert 2018d: 227-228, 230). However, such cures are not found in the majority of therapeutic manuscripts, and the phrases above could therefore indicate that the prescriptions for adults referenced in AMC line 23 and 28 could be modified and applied to children. 35 It is unclear if Sa- gig tablet 40 lists any cases of \"regurgitation\" , although it may be described by the verb urruu (Cadelli 1997: 17, 20, 30; cf. Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 749 note 120). It therefore remains uncertain if \"regurgitation\" was differentiated from \"vomit - ing\" in terminology (cf. Volk 1999: 20-21; see translation by Scurlock 2014: 263-269). 36 This would require an understanding of how little medication a baby or an infant would need. Today, presumably as in ancient times, children are usually treated for issues con- nected to nutrition, common and infectious diseases, as well as injuries or trauma (see, e.g., Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 410ff.; Cadelli 1997: 20-21, 27-29). It is noteworthy that such issues are often treated similarly regardless of age. However, symptoms of diseases can be subtler in babies, and the physician must diagnose beyond specialization. Yet, there is generally little doubt when a child is in pain. Paediatricians today assess pain in infants and young children via a variety of pain scales in order to determine their levels of discomfort (e.g., Beltramini et al. 2017). Infants are prone to non- epileptic motor phe - nomena, such as tremors, jitters, forms of myoclonus, and brainstem release phenomena (Huntsman et al. 2008). The ancient medical texts seem to focus on such experiences in relation to the infant's motor system because they could foreshadow severe afflictions, which in turn could affect the entire household (Volk 1999: 16-17; Cadelli 1997: 23-24). These problems would therefore have been a matter of concern for a healer regardless of the medical knowledge gained from treating children. Practicing on infants and children would have allowed a healer to study failures to thrive in a non- verbal environment, how the body communicates problems and levels of pain under such conditions, as well as sharpening their diagnostic abilities, regardless whether or not this could be transferred 110 Chapter 5 5.2.3 An Interpretation: Kiir-Aur as Paediatrician? In Section 4.2.2, I suggested that Kiir -Aur might have worked (alongside his father) with animals, perhaps only horses, in addition to humans after hav - ing acquired veterinarian knowledge as amall\u00fb eru. Following this line of reasoning, the evidence presented here tentatively suggests that he may have moved on to (aid his father when) treating infants, babies or children at least as amall\u00fb mamau eru. In addition to the obvious dangers of doing more harm than good when practicing medicine, there may have been an economic and ethical value system explaining why practicing on ill animals and babies provided more professional security than on human adults.37 In comparison, the OB laws of ammurabi contain several clauses for both physician (as\u00fb) and veterinarian (as\u00ee alpim ulu imrim) accidents or malprac- tice, which are instructive for understanding what was at risk. Although law collections such as the laws of ammurabi may not reflect actual practice, and instead relate to \"cultural assumptions and values of their drafters and copyists\" (Roth 1995: 4-7 with references),38 they certainly reflect a concern for justice when wronged, which can be used to emphasize tendencies towards punishment: L paragraph 218: \"If a physician (as\u00fbm) performs major surgery with a bronze lancet upon an awlum-man and thus causes the awlum's death, or opens an awlum's temple with a bronze lancet and thus blinds the awlum's eye, they shall cut off his hand\" (Roth 1995: 123).39 directly to adults. These observations were formulated following a personal communica- tion with Elisabeth Lund, chief paediatrician at Kolding Hospital, Denmark. However, it is also possible that Kiir -Aur copied the incantation N4 no. 24 because he himself became a father around this time (JoAnn Scurlock, personal communication). It cannot be excluded that some texts were copied by Kiir -Aur for reasons unrelated to his pro - fession, similar to one of Nab\u00fb-zuqup -knu's manuscripts containing the 12th tablet of the Gilgame Epic (Frahm 1999). 37 One example is the area of surgery, although it is unclear who practiced this in most periods outside of the OB period where the as\u00fb is mentioned in this role in the laws of ammurabi (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 19-20; Geller 2010: 53, 56, 58, 60-61). Even today, there are potential problems related to infections during surgery, and the occasional threat in incantations concerned with \"the obsidian blades of Gula\" (urr naglab Gula) empha- sizes that this was likely considered an equal threat to illness and patient alike as a last resort (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 19; Geller 2010: Westbrook 2003: 17-21. See Guinan 2014: 117 on laws in relation to omens. 39 However, other rules applied if the man was a slave of a commoner (muknum), see paragraph 219-20.111 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau eru paragraph he (i.e., a veterinarian, as\u00ee alpim ulu imrim) per - forms major surgery upon an ox or a donkey and thus causes its death, he shall give one quarter(?) of its value to the owner of the ox or donkey\" (ibid.: 124).40 Causing the death of an ox or donkey while performing surgery on it resulted in a fine of one -fourth(?) of the animal's value. However, if a physician caused a man's (awlum) death or blinded his eye during surgery, he would have his hand cut off, effectively ending his practice. Therefore, less may have been at stake when treating an animal compared to an adult. Although the laws of ammurabi stem from the OB period, they were actually copied, probably for their historic value, in the N4 collection.41 Still, we do not know if regulations for malpractice stipulated in the laws of ammurabi are applicable to the ipu's trade. Children are not mentioned in the extant law collections in relation to healing, but it must be considered certain that infants were vulnerable during pregnancy and in the time following birth, and that they were occasionally in need of medical assistance (Stol 2000: 27-48, 129-34, 209-14).42 It is therefore plausible that the failed healing (or assisted delivery?) of a prominent family member's baby could damage your reputation, although you may have been allowed to continue your practice elsewhere.43 If this analysis is correct, it is possible to identify three hypothetical and generalized steps with increased professional consequences as a result of a failed healing: 1) Animals Economic penalty 2) Infants, babies Damaged social reputation/social exclusion 3) Adults Physical penalty/termination of practice This could imply that some apprentice healers, if trained in all such treat - ments, may have had greater autonomy when healing animals and babies, as the cost of failure would have been more manageable in terms of continuing 40 One fourth or one fifth of the price is unclear (Roth 1995: 142 note 41). 41 Ismail 1982: 199. It is currently unknown if the content related to the laws or the prologue. 42 For birth at the NA court, see Melville 2004: 37 note 1, 42-43, 47. For 272-76 with further references. It seems the death of a child could be associated with misfortune (ibid.: 269-270 with further references). 43 This appears to have been the case for Urad- Gula, the son of Esarhaddon's chief exor - cist Adad- umu-uur . One tenuous suggestion is he was dismissed from the royal court in disgrace because he had failed to oversee the successful delivery of a child, perhaps Assurbanipal's (SAA 10 no. 293; see Parpola 1983a: 354-56). Perhaps this was the reason for his petition to Assurbanipal in the famed \"Forlorn Scholar\" letter (SAA cf. Parpola 1987: 268-69)?112 Chapter 5 his career.44 In these cases, it is likely that the apprentice gained autonomy in treating animals such as horses before babies, which in turn were treated with greater autonomy by the apprentice before adults. However, this remains hypothetical. It should be kept in mind that medical healing often had a reli- gious aspect. In relation to rituals, the success of such performances may have depended on the gods (see Ambos 2010: 17-18). Although healers were likely to be held responsible to some extent for failed healings, it is possible that failure could be interpreted as the will of the gods.45 Yet, no available sources describe the consequences of an unsuccesful treatment by an ipu. The hypothesis above may, however, be tentatively substantiated in rela- tion to Kiir -Aur 's career. As shown in Section 3.5, Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru tablet RA 15 pl. 76 relates to venomous stings and bites as well as horse treatments (colic?). This tablet may therefore relate to knowledge acquisition or perhaps even practice in these areas of treatment. Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb mamau eru tablet N4 no. 24, discussed above, relates to prophylactically treating a child. The evidence is therefore vague and limited. A number of texts copied by Kiir -Nab\u00fb and related to children and pregnancy are copied dur - ing his mamau eru- and mamau-phases , thus indicating such material belonged to later phases. The surviving evidence indicates that Kiir -Aur may have worked with treatments related to horses before children, although he also copied adult treatments as amall\u00fb eru. Though it is possible that Kiir -Aur aided in practicing on adults alongside animals and children throughout his appren- ticeship, I draw on the value system outlined above to suggest that he may have experienced greater autonomy when treating on animals and children before becoming an autonomous healer of adults as well. I therefore hypothesize that Kiir -Aur , in addition to periodically aiding his father with a range of healing activities, may have had greater autonomy when treating horses (and other animals?) and babies before moving on to practice healing on human adults without supervision as mamau. 44 Adults were probably also the most valuable members of a household to keep healthy. Furthermore, adults would also have been able to complain verbally, whereas animals and babies can mainly communicate their distress non- verbally if crying and screams are disregarded. 45 For a survey of ritual failures and mistakes, see Ambos 2007. Some texts stress illnesses that the healer should not attempt to heal (Schwemer 2011: 434).113 mamasu eru-phase is poorly attested, with only one text preserved. Sadly, the manuscript is unpublished and little is known about the content. Nonetheless, a few observations can still be made. Although the exact content of N4 A 2727 is currently unknown, the text contains two incantations with instructions for application, of which the first incantation duplicates BAM 105 obv. 1-6 and presumably also STT 97 col. iv 25-29 (Daniel Schwemer, personal communication). This brief incantation mentions various (gynaecological?) problems concerning a young woman,46 although the brief ritual instruction in BAM 105 obv. 7 explains that the incan- tation was widely used, as it could be recited over any suppository, ointment and enema against \"Anus illness\" (D\u00daR.GIG) (Section 8.4.1; see also Kiir - Aur 's BAM 102 in Section 6.1). Therefore, it is unclear against what problem N4 A 2727 was directed. However, considering the widely applicable use of the incantation and instruction in BAM 105, it does not seem accidental that N4 A 2727 contains the label \"tested prescriptions, which are suitable for use(?)\" (bul latkti a ina qti \u00fb). These are presumably the earliest prescriptions labelled as \"tested\" (latku) copied by Kiir -Aur (see Section 8.3). The phrase a ina qti \u00fb seems to indicate the treatment in question was considered especially useful, although the exact nuances are uncertain (see Ch. 6 note 25). 46 concerned menstruation or a severe gyn- aecological problem. It was certainly employed for \"Anus illness\" on account of the asso - ciated bleeding. The association between menstruation and bleeding from male pelvic orifices were also used in diagnoses concerning \"if a man passes blood from his anus\" or eru-phase Text Content Format and designation N4 A 2727 Obverse and reverse: two incantations with instructions, of which one may have been against \"Anus illness\"Landscape; uiltu114 Chapter 5 Noticeably, only around five tablets represent the various Bba- uma-ibni family members' mamau eru-phases .47 This observation could tentatively indicate that this family did not keep tablets, did not inscribe their names or titles, or kept their tablets elsewhere during the mamau eru-phase. Kiir - Nab\u00fb probably copied three tablets related to pregnancy and babies during his mamau eru- and mamau-phases . child- calming incantation N4 no. 24, the evidence indicates that such mate - rial belonged to the amall\u00fb mamau eru, mamau eru and mamau phases.48 However, he also copied a tablet with prescriptions for skin illnesses of the head (BAM 33) and a commentary to the incantation tummu btu and urpu tablet 2 (AfO 12 pl. as mamau eru. At least the incanta- tion in Kiir -Aur 's N4 A 2727 tested remedy used elsewhere against \"Anus illness\". 5.3.1 Discussion of the mamasu eru-phase Little is known about the concrete competences demanded during the \"junior\" (eru) phases of various professions. For the MA period, Wagensonner has elucidated various aspects concerning the training of three uparru erus who were sons of the 2014a; Wagensonner 2014b; Wagensonner 2011: 647-49). At least the brothers wrote tablets or controlled each other's work.49 Although we cannot deter - mine if they were still engaged in a learning process at this stage, Wagensonner (2011: 649) considered it likely they were already at the peak of their education (cf. ibid. 2014b: 459). 47 See Kiir -Nab\u00fb's mamau eru tablets 12 pl. 13-14, BAM and perhaps KAR 114(?), as well as Nab\u00fb-bssunu's KAL 4 no. 6; cf. Maul 2010a: 208-10. KAR 114 contains another child calming incantation and ritual (Farber 1989: 98-101 no. 32 ms h). 48 Kiir -Nab\u00fb as mamau (eru?), rev. 11: ... MA.[MA (TUR?)], (almost no space), and LKA 143 and N4 no. 247 as mamau (cf. Fadhil 2012: 37 note 2). See also KAR 223 for postponing a birth from happening in the first month of the year, which was copied by Kiir -Nab\u00fb without a title, but including the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase (Stol 2000: 93 and note 19 with references). Furthermore, knowledge related to children is also found in Late Babylonian scholarly texts from Uruk. Stevens suggested a correlation existed within this material between knowledge related to the professional specialism of a tab - let owner and the occurrence of so-called protective formulae in the colophons (Stevens 2013: 211-12; see the discussion of such phrases in Section 6.2.3). If we accept this division, it would seem that diagnoses, treatments, and omens for women, birth, and babies were part of their specialization and this knowledge likely belonged to the mamau eru- and mamau-phases of the Urukean scholars examined by Stevens (e.g., SpTU I no. 38, no. 48, no. 59, SpTU III no. 90, SpTU V Lamatu, well as incan- tations from, e.g., Maql\u00fb and urpu, were copied in the second phase (Gesche 2001: 176). A brief catalogue of five related incantation incipits from the Lamatu series, as well as a number of prescriptions for treating \"Anus illness\" , are also among the medical school tablets published by Finkel (2000: 144, 195-96). Stevens (2013) also found some shared features in the LB Uruk ang\u00fb- Ninurta family's tablet collection, which might mark certain tablets as part of specialist training or as advanced pedagogical texts. These features included the tablets written by erus, designated as commentaries, being mals\u00fbtus or IM.G\u00cdD .DAs (i.e., exercises; cf. Gesche 2001: 50), and containing errors, notes, or brief colophons without ownership or copying statements.50 Stevens sug - gests the \"junior\" status may have lasted \"many months or even years\" (Stevens 2013: 220-21). Interestingly, in SAA 10 no. 290 Urad- Gula writes to the king concerning the exorcist Nab\u00fb-leutu and his son who was performing rituals with him: \"Even I have noticed that this son of his is (still) in the unsteadiness of youth (aurntu)\" (Parpola 1993: 277).51 Therefore, the participating son in this case was clearly considered immature. The question is if he was a (mamau) eru at this time.52 Considering that Kiir -Aur also wrote at least two IM.G\u00cdD .DAs as amall\u00fb mamau eru and mamau, we might consider it likely he was still in training as a mamau eru. In terms of content, Kiir -Aur and his nephew tentatively appears to have been closer to the educational principles of the LB healers than the MA labelled as uiltus throughout his career. Seeing as the label may in some contexts have had a pedagogical nuance (see below), I have included an excursus on the term in this chapter before exam- ining Kiir -Aur 's mamau- and mama bt Aur-phase in the following chapters. However, the exact nuances of the term uiltu in the N4 text collec- tion are poorly understood. Kiir -Aur likely copied four such texts as amall\u00fb eru, one as amall\u00fb, one as mamau eru, possibly four as mamau, 50 2013: 219-20 12 pl. 13-14 was written mamau eru. See also Pearce and Doty 2000: 337-41. 51 SAA 10 no. 290 rev. 1: ... u a-na-ku five as mama bt Aur, and at least three during an uncertain phase.53 The uiltu label was written systematically with the signs \u00fa-\u00ecl-t\u00ec/ti by Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb. In the CAD (U- W: 51), the word is translated as \"a type of tablet about twice as wide as long, inscribed parallel to the longer axis containing a scholar's report, obligation, debt, promissory note, debt note\" (see also AHw: 1405; Gesche 2001: 147), and it is further specified at Nineveh as containing astrological reports and generally having a ratio between its sides of 1:2 with a elu (CAD E: 40; AHw: 189), and it is therefore related to something owed to someone.54 As mentioned in the CAD, uiltu-reports were often written to the NA kings concerning celestial omens (Hunger 1992: XV). Scholars \"kept the which involved watching, guard- ing and protecting the king by ensuring he knew what course the gods had decreed for him (Parpola 1993: XXI- XXII). The inherent responsibility between observation and report may have been reflected in the label uiltu. As discussed in Section 5.3.2, the uiltu label in N4 may tentatively designate the content as an exercise, obligation or commitment on behalf of the copyist. The word uiltu can therefore cautiously be proposed in some instances to indicate a duty or exercise administered by, or made in relation to, a senior teacher, practi- tioner or colleague. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the label could also designate a healer's obligation in relation to a patient. None of Kiir - Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase uiltus are copied on his behalf, which suggests that Kiir -Aur copied them himself. However, it cannot be excluded that the anonymous \"written and checked\" statement, spelled SAR -ma \u00c8, could hide a -stem of aru in some cases (see Section 7.4.2 as well as Ch. 3 note 134). This remains uncertain. Noticeably, Kiir -Aur 's uiltus all seem to be one -columned tablets in portrait format, which is unexpected (see also Maul 2019: 312). The only 53 -Nab\u00fb: BAM comparison, the OB galamu Ur-Utu from Sippar owned 46 letters referring to an etymologically similar \"binding\" (eiltu) that was to be released (paru) by the gods, prob - ably through a ritual (Tanret 2011: 283-284). \"obligation, liability, sin\" (E: 51-52), and in the case of Ur -Utu, it could lead to illness and the eventual loss of life (Tanret 2011: 283-284).117 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau be Kiir -Aur 's three uiltus LKA 83, N4 A 400 and N4 A 2727 in single -column, landscape format. Peculiarly, the majority of Kiir - Nab\u00fb's uiltus seem to be in the landscape format. Why Kiir -Aur 's uiltus largely differ from the expected landscape format is unclear. Perhaps it was no different from choosing paper with lines over paper with squares (Ulla Koch, personal communication). There does not seem to be any distribution of such texts according to specific career phases or content (cf. Finkel 2000: 146). The meaning of the term and the shape of uiltus in general require further investigation. 5.4 Excursus: The a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase At least five of Kiir -Aur 's texts contain the phrase \"whose trust is Nab\u00fb\" (a Nab\u00fb tuklassu) or a variant thereof, usually written a/\u00e1 dAG/PA NIR-su/ GISKIM-su/tuk-lat-su.55 Of these texts, three can be attributed to the amall\u00fb eru-phase (RA 15 pl. 76) and amall\u00fb mamau eru-phase (LKA 89+, LKA 141). This leaves two texts, BAM 9 and BAM 121, which do not contain a title related to a career phase. Although Section 7.1 argues that Kiir -Aur 's tablets without titles belong to later career phases, the presence of this phrase in ear - lier phases could indicate that BAM 9 and BAM 121 belong somewhere before the mamau-phase (see below).56 These two colophons 76 rev. 11': ... a dPA tuk-lat-su; cf. KAL 4 no. 37 rev. 8': [... NI]R-su. The last text was likely copied by Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb (see Section 7.3). Kiir -Nab\u00fb has at least nine tablets with this or similar phrases: CMAwR 1 [...] dAG tuk-lat-su. regularly Sumerogram for Nab\u00fb (PA /AG ) as the theophoric element of his name. 56 Generally, the phrase a Nab\u00fb tuklassu is included directly after the personal name of the copyist or owner of the tablet. However, Kiir -Aur 's BAM 9 and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's LKA 118 differ, and in BAM 9, Kiir -Aur writes an altered version of the phrase after his father Nab\u00fb-bssunu's name (see below). Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts published in CMAwR 1 pl. 25-26 and LKA 118 also show alternative formulations over this thematic sentence.118 Chapter 5 x x x x -\u00fa-m[a (x x x?)] (Catch-line); 70 First [extract], a copy of a writing [ from? ...], 71 [ta]bl[et] exorcist temple], M[arduk ...

BAK 198 ms B BAM 9 is a \"first [extract], a copy of a writing -board [from? ...]\" and is des - ignated as a Kiir -Aur . We should note that Kiir -Aur 's RA 15 pl. 76 and RA 40 pl. 116, both copied as amall\u00fb eru and the former with the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu addendum and described as \"the 32nd? extract\" copying a writing -board, were also designated as uppus. This is not the case for Kiir - Aur 's later numbered extracts.57 57 The catch-line of BAM 9 is repeated as the opening of the single prescription found on BAM 145. This tablet's colophon is unfortunately too broken to determine who wrote it and for what purpose, although Scurlock remarks that \"it is of the 'excerpted for specific performance' type\" (Scurlock 2014: 423). Therefore, it is uncertain if we can regard this 119 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau eru However, the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase in BAM 9 does not resemble the way Kiir -Aur ordinarily writes this phrase, as it also includes an uncertain pas - sage concerning Tamtu.58 Although this may be a variation, it is also note - worthy that the phrase occurs after Kiir -Aur 's father's name and in the middle of his geneology. No comparable examples can be identified among Kiir -Aur 's colophons. As such, it may be an elaborate praise of his father's devotion to the god of writing and his consort. Furthermore, the text contains a protective statement, and such statements only appear in the surviving evi- dence on tablets from Kiir and mama bt Aur-phases as well as an uncertain phase (Section 6.2.3). BAM 121 consists of one-line \"ditto\" (KI.MIN) prescriptions,59 it may have covered several physiological areas with changes marked with a double hori- zontal ruling,60 and it ends with a longer prescription on the reverse. Due to the ana abt epi-phrase, however, the tablet was likely copied for the spe - cific treatment of an afflicted patient, perhaps overseen by Kiir -Aur himself (see Section 7.4). Furthermore, Kiir -Aur used a logographic writing of his name in the colophon (Arb\u00f8ll 2018b). This is one of only two surviving tablets from Kiir -Aur in which this writing occurs (see also N4 no. 175). As such, it is unusual, although the content is not particularly unique. 5.4.1 Kiir-Aur' s Use of the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase In general, the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase in this form seems to occur mainly in connection with individuals connected to the N4 collection, such as the Bba- uma-ibni 1970b: 167; cf. Hunger 1968: 12-15).61 A somewhat comparable phrase occurs in several of the colophons tablet as the one Kiir -Aur wrote following BAM 9, although BAM 145 contains a num- ber of erasures marked in K\u00f6cher's copy. See Ch. 3 note 38. 58 Cf. the following phrase in an Assurbanipal colophon on K. 9404 (Maul whom Nab\u00fb and Tamtu bestowed broad understanding\" (Maul 1994: 280, 282 ms C). See also Hunger 1968 no. 217, 237, 255, 319, 322-23, 326, 329-32, 336, 338, 460. 59 Obv. 4, 5, 6, 7, 13. See Section 3.2. 60 Obv. 1: DIS NA SAG [...], repeated in obv. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8(?). Whether the initial diagnosis concerns the head (SAG .[DU]), headache (SAG .KI.DAB .BA), or the epigastrium (SAG \u00c0) remains uncertain, but the focus was probably different to when it changes in obv. 9: DI NA G\u00cc[RII-\u00fa(?) ...], repeated in obv. 10, 12, 13 and rev. 14. 61 The Bl-kundi-ilya family's colophons can be found in lines 25-26) reads: 25 LIBIR.RA.BI.[GI]M AB.SAR 120 Chapter from Assurbanipal's libraries.62 Maul interprets the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase mainly as a pious and praising supplement, signalling that the copyist was a faithful trainee of Nab\u00fb, but without an exact function in N4 (Maul 2010a: 215 and note 96). Although he did not pursue his analysis further, the subor - dinate relationship to Nab\u00fb seems to occur most frequently diachronically within texts related eru and amall\u00fb mamau eru tablets on which this phrase occurs, it seems to be connected to a number of Kiir -Aur 's student tablets. This is corroborated comparatively by at least one commen- tary from Kiir -Nab\u00fb with this phrase (N4 no. 163 = Geller 2014: 64ff.), albeit this text is from an unknown phase. A number of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's numbered extracts (BAM 52, BAM 106, BAM 147), of which two are instructional (BAM 52, BAM 106), also contain this phrase without a title.63 However, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's mamau- phase tablet N4 no. 247 likely also included the phrase, which argues against the above observations.64 The phrase may in Kiir -Aur 's case have been used primarily on apprentice phase tablets, although the evidence is far from conclusive. Where does this place BAM 9 and BAM 121? As argued in Section 7.1, titles were probably not omitted on tablets with names before Kiir -Aur 's later phases. The use of the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase on these two tablets indicates they may have been part of Kiir -Aur 's apprentice phases. However, the phrase in BAM 9 may relate to Kiir -Aur 's father, Nab\u00fb-bssunu, which would make this text the only example of such a use of the expression by Kiir -Aur . This could indicate the text was earlier than other preserved texts with the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase. This observation, together with the fact that BAM 9 was a first extract related to the head, could support the text being from around Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase. BAM 9 was also labelled a uppu, much like the other numbered extract from his amall\u00fb eru-phase, RA 15 pl. 76. Kiir - Aur 's later extracts were not labelled as uppus. However, the evidence is BA.AN .\u00c8 26 \u00e0-\u00edr p.d30-[x x] \u00e1 dPA NIR-s[u], but since the name is broken and a geneal- ogy is not mentioned, this text cannot be placed. However, it does originate from the N4 library (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 64 no. 188 = Ass. 13955/gz). The text CT 15 pl. 43f. published as SAA 3 no. 37 is reconstructed by Livingstone (1989: 95) as Kiir -Nab\u00fb's on the basis of a partially visible [d]PA a dAG tuk-lat-s[u]. However, the text was excavated in Nineveh and the relationship to Kiir -Nab\u00fb remains uncertain. 62 E.g., Hunger 1968: 98 lines 2-6. 63 Kiir -Aur 's texts also include numbered extracts from the mama bt Aur-phase, thus these texts cannot be generalized according to training (Section 9.2.3). 64 N4 no. 247 rev. 25: amall\u00fb to mamau eru tenuous at best. Perhaps the lack of a title should be explained with this text being from before Kiir -Aur officially became amall\u00fb eru. BAM 9 contains a catch-line that opens the fragmentary tablet BAM 145 with a broken colophon (see Ch. 3 note 38). This text appears to be an exercise of some sort (K\u00f6cher 1963a: XII). If BAM 145 was copied by Kiir -Aur after BAM 9, this would further support BAM 9 as an earlier phase tablet. Considering the indications, although none are conclusive, I regard BAM 9 as a amall\u00fb eru tablet in this study. BAM 121 contains a purpose statement, which indicates that this text is from a later phase of Kiir -Aur 's career (see Section 7.4). The combined use of the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase together with a purpose statement may very tenta- tively indicate this was one of the first tablets Kiir -Aur copied for a healing treatment. I suggest that the text may have been written slightly before or dur - ing the mamau eru-phase, in order to account for the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu- phrase combined with a purpose statement. 5.5 Summary The evidence for Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb-, amall\u00fb mamau eru- and mamau eru-phases problematic as there are few texts, and the manu- scripts in general probably cover several years of Kiir -Aur 's career. During his amall\u00fb-phase, Kiir -Aur copied brief ritual instruc- tions for treating a \"Curse\" (mmtu), as well as guidelines for performing sections of the ritual bt mseri. The latter text was copied \"for his (own) 'read- ing'\" , which suggests an instructive purpose. As a amall\u00fb mamau eru, Kiir -Aur copied texts connected to the domestic cult and infants. One ritual was aimed at reconciling a man with his god and another at treating ghosts, pos - sibly related to the ancestral cult. Albeit very uncertain, Kiir -Aur may have focused on such rituals to be able to treat possible causes of illness. Another of his amall\u00fb mamau eru texts, an IM.G\u00cdD .DA , attests to him copying a peculiar tradition of an incantation to calm an infant, baby or child. This focus on infants could be seen in relation to his other texts from this phase, as crying infants were known causes of disturbance for the family cult. The incantation to calm an infant focused on Lamatu, a known killer of infants and children. If Kiir -Aur treated infants or children medically is uncertain. In general, such treatments are difficult to identify, and it is possi- ble that adult treatments could be administered in revised versions to infants, babies or children. If so, Kiir -Aur could have treated children, but this remains hypothetical. Nevertheless, there existed an overlap in physiological 122 Chapter 5 conceptualisation between infants and horses, which Kiir -Aur had previ- ously encountered as amall\u00fb eru. As a result, it is possible that he used this overlap to gain deeper insight into human physiology in order to provide bet - ter treatments. Due to the increasing economic and cultural worth of horses, children and adults, this chapter hypothesized that Kiir -Aur may have expe - rienced greater autonomy when aiding his father, first when treating horses, thereafter infants or children, and finally adults. If so, Kiir -Aur would have been able to build upon previous insights into animal-human physiology. The argumentation follows the microhistoric approach seeking to illuminate the subject's world via comparative evidence to fill gaps in the documentation. Kiir -Aur was probably still training to become an exorcist during his mamau eru-phase, although the evidence is unclear (see Sections 5.3.1 and 6). His sole text from this phase consists of an uiltu with two incantations and instructions. At least one of the incantations duplicates a relative simple spell used elsewhere for treating \"Anus illness\" (D\u00daR.GIG), which is ordinar - ily considered a relatively simple ailment (see Sections 3.1 and 3.1.1). The con- tent of Kiir -Aur 's manuscript was described as \"tested prescriptions, which are suitable for use(?)\". In the surviving material, such statements were mainly employed after Kiir -Aur became mamau (see Sections 6.2.2 and 8.3; cf. Section 5.3). The text suggests that Kiir -Aur acquired certain treatments considered useful for practice during his mamau eru-phase. Comparative material from Kiir -Aur 's nephew, Kiir -Nab\u00fb, indicates that initiation into advanced knowledge may have begun during the mamau eru. The fact that the material copied in Kiir -Aur 's sole text from this phase may have been used for treating \"Anus illness\" , implies it may not have been considered advanced knowledge. Furthermore, his amall\u00fb manuscript N4 no. 175 suggests that he began copying texts for gaining a deeper understanding of the content earlier during his training. Concerning the differences in skill and responsibility that may be implied in the sequence of titles borne by Kiir -Aur before he became mamau, a number of relevant observations have been presented throughout Chapters 3-5. However, the publication of further texts assigned to Kiir -Aur may alter individual observations as well as the importance of identified focuses. We may therefore not yet be in a position to fully understand all aspects of Kiir - Aur 's training. Nonetheless, I have argued extensively for my ideas, which are supported by comparative evidence. Thus, I consider the hypothesised progression in patient groups, defined by a social hierarchy and autonomous practice, a likely scenario. Although he copied numerous medical texts with treatments for adults, I have on the basis of thorough discussions proposed that some material could perhaps be modified and applied to animals and 123 Further Apprenticeship: amall\u00fb to mamau eru children as well (Section 5.2.2). Furthermore, I have argued that he likely aided his father simultaneously in treating adults and preparing healing ceremonies during his training. Alternative hypotheses may be suggested, although a progression from simple to complex material is not reflected in the material. Almost all of Kiir - Aur 's amall\u00fb eru manuscripts concern healing or rituals instructions for a single individual. During his amall\u00fb-phase, he copied two rituals related to the individual and his house. As a amall\u00fb mamau eru, Kiir -Aur copied texts connected to the domestic cult and infants. When he became mamau eru, he learned tested healing procedures. As a mamau, he copied an increasing number of different text types relevant to practice (Chapter 6), and a wide variety of rituals were copied during this and his mama bt Aur- phase (Chapter 8). Thus, a tentative progress from individual to household in terms of illness, and finally a change in focus towards social problems, evil omens and official cult can be proposed.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 007 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Chapter 6 Kiir-Aur's mamau-phase In this and the following chapter, I examine the mamau-phase of Kiir - Aur 's training, alongside associated material from the mamau- and mama bt Aur-phases . Chapter 6 consists of a close examination of the texts that can be securely assigned to this phase by means of the colophons, in which Kiir -Aur is identified as a mamau, and it provides an in-depth discussion of the significance of some of these texts for Kiir -Aur 's career. In chapter 7, the tablets that can be assigned to the mamau-phase on the basis of text-internal criteria are discussed, even though they do not explicitly iden- tify Kiir -Aur as mamau. The medical texts from Kiir -Aur 's mamau- phase are discussed in relation to his entire production of magico -medical texts in Section 9.1. The texts written during the mamau-phase indicate that Kiir -Aur 's education was not completed until sometime during this phase, yet the pre - cise date on which he would have \"graduated\" is unclear. It is possible that we have to assume an on-the -job transition from student or trainee to indepen- dent practitioner, but this has to remain hypothetical. If my reconstruction is correct, it is possible that some time after he was qualified as an exorcist he was able to begin treating patients on his own, i.e., without supervision, and he was also allowed to conduct house calls. 6.1 Texts with Colophons including the Title mamau Table 9 shows that only eight tablets can be securely assigned to Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase of training, as well as one text that may have been copied by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb. As in the previous phases, none of the tablets are dated. Consequently, the tablets are discussed according to their contents, because no chronological order or sequencing can be established at this point. I have tentatively grouped the tablets in groups of medical texts, ritual texts, and other technical literature perhaps connected to scholarship. The tablets indicate that Kiir -Aur focused on more diverse areas, in contrast with the earlier phases of his education. According to the available evidence, it is also the first time since the amall\u00fb eru-phase that he copied symptom descrip - tions with medical diagnoses. During this phase he also copied out treatments 125 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase Table 9 Texts assigned to Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phasea Group Text Content Format and designation Medical texts BAM 81 Obverse: (broken) Reverse: three prescriptions for a bandage against makadu-illness (rev. 1'-7'), a potion to be drunk (rev. 8'-9') and an enema (rev. 10'-16')Portrait; uiltu BAM 102 Obverse 1') against \"Anus illness\" (rev. 3')Landscape; IM.G\u00cdD .DA (obv. 1-7) and a wash (obv. 8-15) against a shin repeat - edly slackening (obv. 1), hurting feet that change place with one another with paralysis and stiff \"strings\" (obv. 8-10) and paralyzed feet where the patient has difficulty walking (obv. 16-17) Reverse: one broken entry (rev. 1') and four prescriptions for a bandage (rev. 2'-10'), ointment (rev. 11'-17') and a potion to be drunk (18'-19') against stiff \"strings\" of the feet where the patient is unable to walk (rev. 2'-4' , cf. rev. 11'-13')Portrait; uiltu Ritual texts KAL 4 no. 7 Obverse and reverse: one prayer (obv. 1'-6')(Fragmentary, portrait?); uiltu(?) a Bibliography for individual tablets can be found in Appendix 1.

Among the limited medical texts from Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase, BAM 81 contains a prescription possibly against makadu, which partly duplicates another treatment in BAM 122 likely designed for ill feet.2 Other text genres copied during this phase were rituals connected to ill patients (a ritual for going to a patient's house, KAR 230) and preventing evil and illness from entering a house (a ritual intended to safeguard a house from evil demons, KAR 298). The only non-related text is CT 37 pl. 24f., which is a copy treated in BAM 81 is compared to modern vertebral arthritis and muscle strains (see Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 257-58, 488, 505, 720 with further references), but can also affect the qablu, groin/thigh area, maybe the renal and rectal functions, and the \"strings\" of the lower body producing stiffness (see Arb\u00f8ll 2018a; Wasserman 2012; x (x)] 16 ina KA NAG It is uncertain if Kiir -Aur intended to produce a phonetic writing of tigil\u00fb/tegil\u00fb in BAM 81 and BAM 122, or if the Sumerogram was written in a peculiar manner.

Lawson 1994: 47-48). Several of the tablets contain specific features that either are observed for the first time (see below) or appear during the mamau-phase, although one would expect such types of texts earlier. An example of the latter is the IM.G\u00cdD .DA (lit.: \"long tablet\") label found in BAM 102. The NA reading of the label remains uncertain,4 but it is typically interpreted as having had an education or pedagogical function throughout most periods.5 The label there - fore either indicates that Kiir -Aur was not fully trained as a mamau or that the label was used differently in N4. Kiir -Aur also copied another IM.G\u00cdD his amall\u00fb mamau and or Kiir -Nab\u00fb copied the single -columned tablet BAM 206 in portrait format dur - ing an uncertain phase (Section 5.2). Although the term IM.G\u00cdD .DA may not necessarily refer to format during the NA period, both BAM 102 and N4 no. 24 were copied as single -column tablets in landscape orientation. LKA 115 is not only one of the first namburbi-rituals from Kiir -Aur , which can be assigned to a career phase, but it is also the first tablet containing a \"purpose statement\" , i.e., a statement declaring that the content was copied \"for undertaking a (ritual) procedure\" (ana abt epi). Such statements are investigated in Section 7.4. LKA 115 also states that Kiir -Aur had someone copy the text on his behalf (\u00fa-a-ir-ma \u00edb-ri). Such authority indicates Kiir - Aur was in a position to supervise junior exorcists, and this evidence will be further examined in Section 7.4.2. The following sections evaluate the specific content and use of Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase tablet KAR 230 for making house calls, KAR 298 for providing rituals securing houses, LKA 115 and KAL 4 no. 7 in relation to a general discus - sion on his use of namburbi-rituals , and finally CT 37 pl. 24f. and its connection to scholarship. 4 Possibilities include 2011a: 29 and note 96; Beaulieu 1992: 103 and note 16. 5 For possible uses of IM.G\u00cdD .DA tablets in NB and LB second phase school tablets, see Gesche 2001: 49-50. In NA royal letters, the IM.G\u00cdD .DA tablet perhaps designates a text recited for educational purposes (see Zamazalov\u00e1 2011: 324; Livingstone 2007: 104-5; SAA 10 no. 39 rev. 8-9 SAA 16 no. 28 obv. 3-4). The term was used in the advanced pedagogical tablets from the later phases of education in the LB Urukean libraries (Stevens 2013: 219-20). Note that \"extra- neous\" (a\u00fb) scholarly knowledge is written on IM.G\u00cdD tablets (e.g., Fincke 2001: 23-25). 129 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase 6.2 Making House Calls: Discussion of KAR 230 It is possible that making house calls could be interpreted as marking the transition from trainee to practitioner. We know that exorcists made house calls to diagnose illnesses and cure them. The opening phrase of the 1st sub - series of Sa- gig was also the name of the series: \"When the exorcist goes to the house of the sick man\" enma ana bt mari ipu illaku (Hee\u00dfel 2000: 19, 20-21).6 Furthermore, several healing ceremonies explicitly refer to the house and especially the bed of the patient.7 Although it has been suggested that patients were treated in their homes because of impurity (Avalos 1995: 177-82), Stol has stressed that phrases such \"his bed has seized him\" must be consid- ered as evidence that one was also bedridden in a physical sense (Stol 1997: 408; Arb\u00f8ll 2019; see CAD no indication before Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase that he was in charge of patients and made house calls to diagnose and treat people's maladies on his own. The unedited text KAR 230, written during Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase, may designate the critical point at which Kiir -Aur was considered qualified to be responsible for a patient's healing.8 The text con- sists of a Babylonian ritual for making house calls and contains an incantation and ritual designated as: \"Recitation: the exorcist goes to the house of the sick man\".9 Hee\u00dfel (2000: 70 and note 7) originally saw this incantation as a means for the exorcist to determine the cause of an illness en route to the patient's house, although this was not necessarily the only purpose. The text remains unedited and without known duplicates. In what follows, I discuss some aspects of the incantation and ritual instruction in KAR 230 in order to con- textualize this text in relation to Kiir -Aur 's use during his mamau-phase. 6 A. 3739a+b KAR 26 obv. 25 in a prayer to Marduk that mentions that the exorcist does not walk along the streets without Marduk (Mayer 1999: 150, 157; see Schwemer 2007b: 184). Whether or not the N4 exorcists practiced healing in their own home remains uncertain (cf. Robson 2019: 130, 259; May 2014: 64, 78). 7 The bed is also mentioned in several symptom descriptions. For examples concerning a bed, see Farber 2014: 171, 187, 193; CMAwR 1: 35, 91-92, 's reference to the patient's bed in BAM 129 (Farber 2004: 127 note 54). 8 Nils Hee\u00dfel is currently preparing new copies and editions of KAR 230 and KAR 31. For the lat - ter text, see below. I would like to thank him for discussing KAR 230 and sharing his personal notes with me. 9 KAR 230 obv. 15: KA.INIM.MA The Incantation of KAR 230 The first line of the incantation in KAR 230 states: \"Incantation: Who attacked him (i.e., the patient) and changed his mind? His heels [are swollen(?), and] he is unable to [wa]lk about\".10 The line refers to two commonplace evils encoun- tered in Mesopotamian diagnostics, namely the \"attack\" van der symptoms, and the \"changed mind\" (mu an\u00fb), indicating a mental 2019 with references; Stol 2009; Kinnier word mu combined with the verb an\u00fb \"to be changed, become differ - ent\" indicates an alteration of the mind, which is often translated as \"insane\" (CAD : 95-96d ; Stol 2009; Farber 1977: 74-75). However, an affected mu is also occasionally hinted at during severe illness or imbalance.11 In SAA 10 no. 196, for example, an advice reads: \"not eating and not drinking confuse (D-stem au) the mind (mu) and adds to illness\" (Parpola 1993: 159; CAD : 95b).12 Likewise, a variant in a diagnosis in Sa- gig illustrates a concrete afflic- tion's diagnostic traditions, ranging from physical to psychological: \"[If ...] his affliction keeps changing: (var. ) his mentality keeps changing, 'Hand' of S\u00een [...]\".13 Although mu an\u00fb refers specifically to a state of insanity, and not a generic symptom of illness,14 it is not impossible that the phrase in KAR 230 intends to cover other alterations of the mind as well. Several lines of the incantation are too broken to be completely restored, although the recitation seems to relate to whether or not a divine power can hurt the patient.15 The more legible ending reads: 10 See the provisional readings of two, see similar examples in CAD fell on his 'top' (muu)\" , and in combination with the reference to \"heel\" (eqbu) in obv. 2, it is possible the text intended to hint at the head-to -toe arrangement found in, e.g., Sa- gig, Ugu, and the AMC. 11 Perhaps this is why imur-er, \"it cures twenty (maladies)\" , Stadhouders also an OB letter stating: \"... I was almost insane for three days. I did not touch food or even water\" (Oppenheim 1967: 87). 12 SAA 10 no. 196 2012: 608, 679). The reference may refer to changes in behaviour in connection to either physical or psy - chological symptoms. 14 Although it is unclear if a delirium could be included in this state. 15 E.g., obv. 8 ... ana ka-me Z\u00da .KU[D? \u00c9N kurnugia (the Netherworld), like a dead man cannot 'add (to) life' and Kbu (the divine stillborn baby) cannot suckle the milk of its mother, I entrust you to the seven gatekeepers (idugallu) of Erekigal; mimma lemnu shall not approach him! It is (an incantation) of Ninurta, lord of the command.18 These lines imply that the malady was sent to the netherworld.19 The text sym- bolically cuts off the devouring malady by referring to the dead's inability to become well and the divine unborn fetus Kbu's inability to suck at its moth- er's breast (Stol 2000: 26-32). The demonic force is then handed over (paqdu) to the gatekeepers of Erekigal and thereafter kept in the netherworld.20 Finally, the incantation specifies that the generic mimma lemnu \"Any Evil\" should not approach the patient, and that this command - i.e., the entire incantation - is a spell of Ninurta. 16 It is unclear how to interpret the signs after NU . I have chosen to read the writing is ackward. In at least one NA letter, a verbal form of rudd\u00fb and balu are used in hendiadys to designate \"to feel better\" (ibid.: 243). Alternatively, the sign rud could emended to TUK!-u for ra\u00fb \"\"to acquire, obtain\" , to be unattested (cf. CAD R: 193ff.). An unlikely alternative -u for r u \"sustenance tube\" , though it would be unclear why it should have a long -u. For ru in general, see Another solution is to interpret the reading as corrupt. 17 Ebeling writes \"rasur\" on the copy KAR 230 in relation to the ki in obv. 13, although this is not entirely clear on the original. This requires further collation. The use of paqdu \"to entrust\" is also used of patients in relation to protective deities or sections of the royal palace in which case it may indicate confinement or protection (see Parpola 1983a: 109-10). See also the negative use of paqdu in relation to pregnancy and children (Steinert 2018d: 269). 18 Obv. 9 likely contains the verbal form a-a-rad-ka \"I will send you away\". 19 This seems to resemble the purpose of the Itar -Dumuzi rituals published by Farber (1977), wherein the generic evil mimma lemnu is also mentioned several times (ibid.: 9). Note that Kiir -Aur 's only dated text, KAR 267, contained a ritual associated with these Itar -Dumuzi rituals (see Section 7.5). However, Kiir -Aur is not supplied with a title in the text's colophon. 20 These gatekeepers are referenced in the myth of Nergal and Erekigal, see Ponchia and Luukko 2013: 13, 23. Only one gatekeeper (l\u00fa\u00cc.DU) is specified in Itar's Descent, see Lapinkivi 2010: 9, 29. 132 Chapter 6 Several largely unedited ulbazizi incantations also revolve around themes of identifying mimma lemnu (at-ta man-nu mim-ma lemnu), and at least one example explicitly hands the evil over (paqdu) to the doorkeepers of the underworld (SpTU III no. 82 col. ii 27-33). The incantation therefore addresses any malady that may have come upon a patient and attempts a dismissal of a generic and unidentified evil, perhaps before the healer has provided a diagno - sis or as a broadly applicable means against any cause of illness.21 6.2.2 The Ritual and Purpose of KAR 230 The ritual instruction largely adds to the above section. The instruction con- tains four relevant points. First, two figurines of Marduk and Ninurta are made out of wax, the exorcist performs mouth- washing to enable them to receive a number of offerings placed before them on pairu-tables , and the incanta- tion is recited three times.22 Thereafter, the incantation is recited three times over the sick patient before performing a takpirtu purification rite.23 Then, the Marduk figurine is placed at the head of the patient's bed and the Ninurta figu- rine is placed at the lower end, and for one day the incantation is recited three times before them while a brazier is supplied with buru-juniper .24 Finally, 21 Another possible example of a universal ritual against many different maladies and vari- ous portends is KAR 26 (= N2 8), see Schwemer 2007b: 57-58; NU D\u00d9-u, written onto the edge, contains a third person description of what occurs in relation to the presumed second person in obv. 18; incantation 3 times in front of them\". 23 KAR 230 rev. 1-2: [\u00c9N] SAG GI.N\u00c1 NU an-ni-t\u00fa ka-a-a-an N\u00cdG .NA imLI GAR -an x (x?). Both the ina (rev. 4) and GIM (rev. 5) are written on the left side, almost as a note, although not in smaller handwriting. This is not entirely clear on Ebeling's copy, but has been collated. The OB adverbial expression kma kayyantim(ma) \"as normal, cus - tomary\" is the only example with these two words (CAD K: 41; CDA 154). Perhaps the GIM was a note to designate to Kiir -Aur that \"when(ever you recite the incantation), con- stantly you ...\"? The term kayyn (u) was also used from the 7th century BCE onwards to designate the literal or regular sense of a word in a context in commentaries (Gabbay 2016: 182-194). Although KAR 230 likely stems from an older tradition, the GIM is placed conspicuously on the left side of the tablet, which could indicate there was something to notice here for the copyist/reader of the text. However, any interpretative function kayyn could possible have in KAR 230 is uncertain at this point. For the understanding of supplying a brazier with juniper, see Mayer 1994: 114; Mayer and van Soldt 1991: 112. It is unclear if the sign SAR in the colophon (rev. 12) could indicate an unexpected -stem, and 133 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase the last two lines of the ritual instruction likely relate to the efficacy of the ritual and how it was obtained: Rev. 7 ne-pi-am lat-ku u-\u00fa? <U> \u00c8-u?[x?]-x x x x-a25 ritual procedure [x?]; [extra]cted? 'according to' an imgidd\u00fb-tablet, which (is) suitable for use [...].26 The ritual itself does not focus on determining the cause of illness. Instead, it produces two figurines of deities that are intended to combat the non- specific evil,27 provides a purification ritual for the idols and the patient, and provides an attempt at a scholarly reasoning why this ritual was applied and how it was conceived. As such, the ritual intends to protect the patient and provide a \"uni- versal\" protection ritual, which could presumably be performed at the start of a healing ceremony. The last section of the ritual instruction cited above describes the ritual as a \"tested ritual procedure\" (Section 8.3). Furthermore, this section likely states that the text was extracted from an unspecified IM.G\u00cdD .DA , maybe for check - ing something (e.g., the effect of the ritual?) or possibly considered suitable for use. As a result, the ritual instruction contained a statement similar to those therefore designate that the tablet was copied on Kiir -Aur 's behalf by someone else (cf. Ch. 3 note 134). 25 I have interpreted a corrupt reading of the phrase a ana qti \u00fb, although only \u00e1 ana and \u00c8 (bar\u00fb, wa\u00fb) are visible. As such, it is possible that the line referred to \"checking\" the effect(?) of the ritual procedure. However, if my restoration is correct, the understanding of a ana qti \u00fb is a problem. Meanings range between \"what is at hand, available\" or \"which is suitable for use(?)\" (for references, see CMAwR 2: 416; CMAwR 1: 64, 121). Abusch and Schwemer (CMAwR 1: 235) in one instance cautiously propose: \"that is well proven\" as an alternative translation. The end of the line remains uncertain and needs further collation. However, it seems reasonable to assume the final a relates to a verbal form of nasu. Perhaps the ending read ZI!?-a, although this reading does not account for the remaining signs. Another possible suggestion could be: [a- a]n-i as!-su!?-a (Nils Hee\u00dfel, personal communication). 26 Such tested ritual procedures are also mentioned in, e.g., BAM 322 rev. 89, see Ch. 9 note 147; Steinert 2015: 129 and note 84. See also strings of amulet stones, suitable for use, from the mouth of ancient sages from before the flood\" (Geller 2010: 1; Lambert 1957: 8). 27 Marduk and Ninurta were associated with war metaphors, which were regularly invoked by the exorcist, see B\u00f6ck 2014a: 183-85.134 Chapter 6 found in colophon describing how the text itself was conceived. However, this was not the colophon, and the statement therefore served another purpose than the copying statements found in colophons. It may have been a descrip - tion of a scholarly method for obtaining the cure found within the text or sim- ply intended to underline the usefulness of the ritual. 6.2.3 The Secrecy Statement of KAR 230 KAR 230 contains a section between the ritual instructions and the final colo - phon, separated from them by horizontal lines, stating: \"A secret of exorcism (iptu). An expert may show an expert; a non [exper]t may not see (it). (As) for your son whom you love, make him swear by Asallui and Ninurta and (only) then show (it to) him!\" (see Lenzi 2008a: 166-78).28 The statement focuses on keeping knowledge within a professional sphere. But how these phrases should be understood is still unclear. Such so -called \"secrecy labels\" and the associated \"Geheimwissen colophons\"29 have had a problematic research history due to the recurring problem of their incon- sistent and low distribution over time Lenzi examples and provided a typology. Later, Beaulieu (1992: 109-10), for example, suggested secrecy statements in LB Uruk could work to restrict dissemination of certain learning within a social setting. In the past decade, Lenzi (2008a: 204, 214, 380) conceded that texts with such statements cannot be distinguished from others based on content. However, he suggested that texts with such secrecy statements were \"restricted to authorized individuals\" (Lenzi 2008a: 160; cf. Stevens 2013: 211 note 3). Others have argued that the phrases merely attest to professional pride (Koch 1995: 95-96; Livingstone 214-15) has reasoned for both secrecy and protective phrases32 working together towards protecting knowledge and categorising texts linked Rev. MA.MA.ME may stand for iptu, as it does not have a l\u00fa determinative. ME can also be found in writings such as L\u00da .ME for amltu (see CMAwR 1: 310 line 105\" , 431 line 9). 29 These statements also focus on secrecy, but they are part of the actual colophons. 30 For the most recent overviews, see Stevens 2013: 211 note 3 and Lenzi 2008a: 2-15 with further references. 31 Rochberg (2004: 213) agrees with Neugebauer and takes the term \"esoteric\" as a reference to exclusivity and therefore not incomprehensibility. 32 These phrases, occurring in colophons, are intended to protect the knowledge, and they include the so -called \"Geheimwissen colophons\" and statements such as: \"Whoever 135 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase to professional and individual intellectual identity in LB Uruk. As a result, Stevens stated that the marked texts express \"a network of clearly articulated relationships between the professional specialism(s) of the individual scholar and the text he sought to protect\" (ibid.: 231). Regardless, these results cannot be compared directly to the NA evidence. Among Kiir -Aur 's texts with colophons, two \"Geheimwissen colophons\" KAR 230, copied when Kiir -Aur was mamau, and the cultic explanatory text KAR 307, copied when he was mama bt Aur.33 Considering Kiir -Aur 's wider use of protective phrases, such as curses, these are found on seven of Kiir -Aur 's texts.34 Among these texts, four are from his amall\u00fb eru-phase,35 two are from his amall\u00fb-phase, and one is from his mama bt Aur-phase. These texts include both numbered extracts (RA 15 pl. 76) and text copied according to known rows of entries from standardized therapeutic Nineveh tablets (BAM 129, see Section 9.3.4). No truly recognizable features can be deducted from the texts with secrecy and protective phrases. Although they may have been particularly important to Kiir -Aur , one can easily find groups of texts comparable to these, but with- out such phrases. The texts relate to all areas of importance for Kiir -Aur 's career, i.e., healing (BAM 129, BAM 131, RA 15 pl. 76, RA 40 pl. 116), making house calls (KAR 230), ritually demarcating houses (N4 no. 175), performing exorcistic rituals (KAL 10 no. 4, LKA 77), and possibly participating in rituals connected to the Aur temple (KAR 307). 6.2.4 Interpretation of KAR 230 In relation to KAR 230, Lenzi (2008a: 167) argued that this secrecy phrase may have represented an actual formalized procedure wherein a father or master may have passed on the knowledge contained on a \"secret\" tablet to a son or apprentice, and therefore this procedure would have provided \"an objective reveres Anu, Ellil and Ea shall not take it (i.e., the tablet) away by theft\" (Stevens 2013: 213-14; cf. Lenzi 2008a: 204). 33 The fact that the statement in KAR 230 occurs in a separated section could indicate that it was originally part of the text copied. It is therefore not strictly speaking a colophon. Several of the examples listed by Lenzi are from Kiir -Aur and well as texts excavated within N4. Among Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts focusing on secrecy in statements or colophons include BAM 199 and N4 no. 80. 34 BAM 9, BAM 131, RA 15 pl. 76, RA 40 pl. 116, KAL 10 no. 4, LKA 77, N4 no. 175. Several of these also contain statements prohibiting the erasure of the copyist's name. See also Beckman and Foster 1988 no. 21, which contains a broken colophon with a prohibition against eras - ing the copyist's name. 35 Including BAM 9, which lacks a title but is placed in this category due to text -internal features. See Section 5.4.136 Chapter 6 marker in the subordinate's experience to indicate that he passed from normal activity into one that was marked as in some way special\". Although this inter - pretation entails a literal understanding of the statement and a synthesis of ancient practices based on conjecture, it is appealing to accept such an under - standing in relation to how KAR 230 functioned in Kiir -Aur 's training. Regardless of how the secrecy statement is interpreted, KAR 230 may have represented Kiir -Aur 's initiation into a special ritual procedure, perhaps particularly appreciated and transmitted within this family.36 The text is with- out known duplicates, which underlines its significance among the N4 tablets. Furthermore, the tablet was designated as a \"copy from Babylon\" and labelled as an uiltu.37 Such uiltus can perhaps be considered a commitment of some sort (see Section 5.3.2). Maybe Kiir -Aur was expected to know this or similar rituals as part of his specialized training in order to become a practicing exor - cist, and the uiltu-label, if understood as a commitment, may have been the task of acquiring the final pieces necessary to practice. Presumably, when Kiir -Aur copied KAR 230 he acquired the knowl- edge this text represents (Section 1.4). If this was the case, KAR 230 may have been a ritual Kiir -Aur copied before being able to make house calls on his own, although he was already mamau at the time and dabbled in schol- arly matters (see Section 6.5). Maul (2010a: 216) has suggested that approba- tion probably took place when one was awarded the title mamau, but in this case we may assume the authorization for making house calls may have occurred when Kiir -Aur gained the necessary ritual. I suggest that KAR 230 represents the dividing line between Kiir -Aur acting as an assistant and taking charge of a patient's healing. Perhaps Kiir -Aur 's family used the secrecy phrase in the particular case of KAR 230 to emphasize the meaning of this text. Though this may have been the case, secrecy labels must have varied over time and place and cannot generally be explained in relation to exorcistic training. 6.2.5 Nab\u00fb-bssunu's Ritual for Approaching a Patient: KAR 31 Another ritual from Kiir -Aur 's father, Nab\u00fb-bssunu, relates directly to attending patients as a healer. Nab \u00fb-bssunu copied the bilingual incantation KAR 31 at an unclear stage of his career (edited in Maul 2018; Geller 2016: 38-39). 36 Lenzi's comment that the content of KAR 230 is \"nothing special\" has been disproven by the analysis above (cf. Lenzi 2008a: 167). 37 KAR 230 rev. mamau-phase The incantation was a recitation to keep various demons from approaching the exorcist when he approaches a patient.38 The ritual states: Its ritual: grind up male and female nikiptu-plant, mix it in honey and ghee, when you will approach the patient, you first anoint yourself, (so that) in order to approach the patient, 'Any evil' (mimma lemnu) will not approach you. Geller 2016: 4039 The incantation and ritual are therefore designed to make the exorcist apply a cream to his skin to protect himself from the potential danger inherent in being in close proximity to illness (Maul 2018: 181; Geller 2016: 40).40 Such pro - tection for the healer is also prescribed in the third tablet of Udug -ul, which in all respects resembles the colophon of the second tablet of Sa- gig: \"If you approach a patient; until you cast an incantation onto yourself, you should not approach the patient\".41 The two incantations and rituals KAR 31 and KAR 230 therefore cover two crucial areas connected to healing, which are also attested as two vital points in Sa-gig, namely: going to the patient's house and approaching the patient. Whereas KAR 230 covers the first part, KAR 31 covers the protection of the exorcist when approaching the patient. At least Kiir -Aur and his father 38 Sagulaza-demon, evil Al\u00fb- demon, Antaubba- epilepsy , and whatever else should not approach the exorcist\" (see Maul 2018: 186, 188; Geller 2016: 39-40). HKL parallels K. 9836+K. 10338+K. 20638, and K. 10565. 39 KAR the pictures in Maul 2018: 178-79). 40 In an OB medical text edited by Wasserman (1996) concerning carbuncles (kurru), the final passage may encourage the healer(?) to protect himself as follows: \"[As] soon as he finishes you should rub (lit.: anoint) your face so that [the illness will not] return to you\"; ibid.: original restoration and interpretation of lines 117-122 in the Poor Man of \u00c9N ana N\u00cd-ka UB -\u00fa ana GIG NU TE-i. Note the warning to cast an incanta- tion onto a patient with particular symptoms before approaching him (Wee 2012: 71 note 114; Tsukimoto 1999: 193 lines 41-42).138 Chapter 6 Nab\u00fb-bssunu seem to have focused on and transmitted this knowledge as part of the family trade. 6.3 Ritually Protecting the Houses of Clients: Discussion of KAR 298 Kiir -Aur also copied KAR 298 as mamau. The text contains several rituals intended to protect households from illness and epidemics. Kiir -Aur had previously worked with prophylactic measures as amall\u00fb mamau eru in relation to calming a crying child in order to revoke the evils heralded by its cries. However, the rituals in KAR 298 provide the performer(s) with the power to keep out various demons and plagues. This is another relatively new area of ritual performance learned by Kiir -Aur during his mamau-phase, and the following sections investigate KAR 298 and discuss it in relation to Kiir -Aur and his family's use of certain quarantine measures in connection to illness treatments. 6.3.1 The Purpose and Content of KAR 298 KAR 298 contains extracts of two texts listed in the EM as 1) \"to block (the entry of) 'the foot of evil' into man's house\" and 2) ...\" (Wiggermann 1992: 41ff., 91).42 The text likely had a broken label in the colophon and it was \"quickly [extracted]\".43 In order \"to block (the entry of) 'the foot of evil' into a man's house\" , the ritual used protective figurines buried in various places underneath a house. This ensured that p lemutti \"the foot of evil\" would not enter as \"stroke, blow\" and relates it to an epidemical hit, blow, sweep\". KAR 298 opens in obv. 1: ana dA[LAD? NU [du from and to entry of) ...? feet' into a man's house\" (cf. (1968: 70 = BAK 201 ms I line 1) in reconstructing [ana abt epi] before Kiir -Aur 's name. Although this is possible, as something was likely broken before Kiir - Aur 's name, it is more plausible that the text contained a copying statement. However, the copy does not show clearly how many signs were broken. 44 The ritual was also performed for Esarhaddon's sister additu in SAA 10 no. 273 (cf. Parpola 1983a: 206-7; Maul 1994: 36). Here, able\" (rev. 16: la!-a le-e-e) by the writer Nab\u00fb-nadin- umi, who states that instead of protecting her he exp ]osed her\" (rev. 13: [\u00fa-se]-i-a-i).139 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase ominous happenings could be diagnosed with p lemutti \"foot of evil\" , 1992: 96). Comparable rituals such as \"to keep diu - illness (and) plague, pestilence from nearing the horses and the army of the king\" (Maul 2013: 18 and note 19) and for purifying the stables (ibid.: 19ff., 22 note 43) suggest (zoonotic) epidemics must have been regularly attested. Wiggermann (1992) edited both KAR 298 (text II) and the standard Nineveh recension of \"to block (the entry of) ...\" (text I ), and he noted several differences between the two texts. The Nineveh recension, for example, describes figurines made of ru, tamarisk, and clay consecutively, whereas KAR 298 breaks this sequence to describe groups of related figurines (ibid.: 87). Additionally, KAR 298 differs by specifying the place of interment of each statue in the relevant entry, providing more complete descriptions of figures, and quoting incipits of incantations in the relevant instructions (ibid.: 89-90). These discrepancies may stem from an unidentified Assur recension (ibid.: 88), but could also attest to a manageable reference layout for eased use. Furthermore, KAR 298 has double rulings between obverse lines 40-41 and reverse lines 10-11. The first ruling seems to mark a shift from a related group of gods and sages to a group of monsters, whereas the purpose of the second ruling is unclear (Wiggermann 1992: 45). At reverse line 23, the text changes to another group of rituals known as \"to make diu -illness , stroke, and plague pass by\" (ibid.: 90). This second group of rituals may have had a similar purpose to the first group in KAR 298, although they use different means of accomplish- ing this (ibid.: 91-92). In addition to using wooden ships to carry the illness away (rev. 23-25), the third and penultimate sections prescribe smearing cer - tain substances on the doorpost of the house in question (rev. 41-42), as well as burying substances at the outer gate (rev. 43-44) in order to ensure that witchcraft does not approach a man's house (CMAwR 1: 215 ms U, 233, 426 ms B, 428).45 The third to last entry also specifies the duration of the prophylactic effect: \"illness, diu-illness , distress, and pestilence will not come near the man or his house for one year\" (CAD M/2: 297c).46 As mentioned in Section 2.3, many figurines were excavated underneath the floor of the N4 house.47 However, Wiggermann (1992: 99-100, cf. 102-3) 45 The instructions describe a \"creaking gate\" to express that witchcraft was approaching (KAR 298 rev. 43: DI NA K\u00c1 a /u/ and wrote an /ina/ too much in KAR 298 rev. 41. This may be compared to the episode described in Exodus 12.7 regarding marking one's house with sacrificial blood so that the angel of death will pass by one's house. 46 KAR 298 rev. 40: ... GIG di-u di-lip-t\u00fa u \u00da.ME ana MU .1.KAM NU TE-\u00fa. 47 See Klengel-Brandt 1968. For protective figures in the Aur temple, see Huxley 2000.140 Chapter 6 concluded that the figurines found in N4, albeit the house is incompletely exca- vated, \"show differences with the figurines of the ritual\" in details and \"their positions do not conform strictly to the prescriptions of the ritual but rather to the general ideas underlying these prescriptions\". He conceded, however, that we do not know for what ritual these figurines were installed. Perhaps the ritu- als in KAR 298 were ideal models, which could be modified according to need and context. Kiir -Aur 's hypothesized position as head of ceremonies, possibly fore - shadowed by KAR 230 as argued above, was likely cemented before or after KAR 230 through his acquisition of the relevant rituals for protecting clients' houses in KAR 298. KAR 298 may represent a convenient aide m\u00e9moire, which Kiir - Aur could consult easily upon having to perform the necessary part of the rituals. The text is therefore similar to other of his manuscripts concerning the information it provides (e.g., KAL 10 no. 1 and N4 no. 175). The inherent responsibility in providing ritual protection for an entire house and its house - hold also indicate that Kiir -Aur was in a capacity to supervise rituals. 6.3.2 KAR 298 in the Context of Associated Rituals The focus on keeping out various evils in KAR 298 illustrates that Kiir -Aur as mamau utilized certain procedures to protect houses. Considering Kiir - Aur 's function as a healer, it is not surprising that the rituals in KAR 298 contain elements comparable to bt mseri \"the house of confinement\" , which was a ritual intended to confine a patient already afflicted with a malady (Wiggermann 1992: 105-6).48 As such, evidence suggests part of the production of figurines in KAR 298 could be adapted to serve as a \"quarantine procedure\" in cases of illness. This is substantiated through associated texts within Kiir - Nab\u00fb's material discussed in this section. The ritual bt mseri was also known in N4. Kiir -Aur copied an overview of the ritual with incantation incipits as amall\u00fb (N4 no. 175) as well as part of this ritual(?) during an uncertain phase of training.49 Furthermore, an extract of the second tablet was excavated in the N4 collection (no. 572, VAT 13666+; Meier 1941-44, ms C). Unfortunately, both Kiir -Aur 's texts and the 48 The ritual appears as \"to confine the patient\" , mara ana 105-6 with references to texts). Udug -ul tablet 12 was largely duplicated a relationship between Udug -ul tablet 12 and KAR 298. 49 The tablet is N4 no. 254, which remains unpublished. Reportedly, the colophon is broken. The first incantations(?) from the four tablets of bt mseri may be listed in an incantation catalogue from N4 no. 291 (= VAT 13723+) published as text A in Geller 2000, see fragment A lines 4'-6' (ibid.: 232; cf. bt mseri in general remain largely unpublished and unedited.50 Generally, bt mseri used a number of figurines and drawings, which through incantations and rituals rid the patient and his house of demons, as well as ensuring that additional evils were kept out of the house type of figurine produced in both KAR 298 and bt mseri includes depictions of \"sages\" (apkal lus).51 However, ritual loci,52 actions performed during and after the ritual,53 as well as the use of some depictions54 differed in several instances between KAR 298 and bt mseri. Nonetheless, there is further evidence for the use of rituals demarcating houses to exclude or expel evil among the Bba- uma-ibni family members, through their association with an incantation known as: \"The house is 2001: 12) were used for producing flour circles to create ritual enclo - sures, and these also made use of this incantation. The incantation was also associated with bt mseri (Wiggermann 1992: 105, 111-12, 117). The incantation is mentioned on the fifth tablet of bt mseri (AMT 34,2) where a goat (uru/ M\u00c1) was tied to the head of the patient.55 A similar \"scapegoat\" ritual was 50 Sections of the ritual have been published in various locations: Wiggermann 1992: 105-17 collected (L\u00da .L\u00c0L, apotropaic function (Wiggermann 64, 100, copied a ritual related to the Itar -Dumuzi rituals (Farber 1977) as mama bt Aur (Section 8.5). 52 The initial focus in bt mseri was the bedroom from which the ritual radiates out (Seidl and Sallaberger 2005-06: 67). 53 Bt mseri ended with the removal of figurines and drawings, and throwing the figurines in the river (Seidl and Sallaberger 2005-06: 67 and note 38). 55 Wiggermann \"he tied a goat to the patient's head at the front of his bed, he set up an urigallu- standard at the (patient's) head\" (Geller 2016: 430). Such urigallu- standards were also featured individually or in groups in bt rimki, ms p\u00ee, p lemutti ina 2005-06: a relationship between bt mseri and ms p\u00ee, see Walker and Dick 2001: 9, 15. The Assyrian sacred tree possibly was also named urigallu (Tsukimoto 1985: 125ff. with references),56 ehru (N4 no. 289) and Kiir - Nab\u00fb at an uncertain stage of his career (LKA 79). Tummu btu was featured in two of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's commentaries,57 perhaps indicative of its likely use as part of advanced education (Gesche 2001: 176; Finkel 1991: 102). Unfortunately, only individual btu are known, e.g., via Kiir -Nab\u00fb's commentaries.58 The commentaries are fortunately illus - trative and show that the incantation focused on ritually demarcating a house:59 The house is put under a spell, the floor has been prepared, (Meaning) GI.UR is esqu (which) is 'to incise, make a drawing' (which) is a drawing,60 Do not enter to him through the window of the side (of the house), (Meaning) the window of the bathroom (bt ramki), ... (Variety of windows follows with explanations) ... Ditto (i.e., do not enter to him) hidden in the shadow of a man, (Meaning) in secret, ... (Variety of entrance-related materials follows with explanations).61 The incantation therefore emphasizes shutting out evil and denying it a place to hide within a house. This mirrors the purpose of the rituals in the prophylactic 56 LKA 79 obv. 1: ana pu-u-i L\u00da a-na dEre-k[i- gal ...]. For some examples of rituals employ - ing scapegoats, see Geller 2016: 430; Maul 2013: no. 220. Frahm 58 2013a; 2001: 8, 12. In muuu, tummu btu is recited at the end of the alongside the Sag-ba 39 The incantation 'Be conjured, house' (tummu btu) - you pile up roasted flour and 40 you draw a circle of flour around the gate. You close the gate, but your hand does not have to touch the door!\". The incantation is also used in a ritual intended to secure \"brisk trade\" of the innkeeper where various types of dust and fluids are smeared onto a man's door (Panayotov 2013; and must stem from the verbal root nasqu and therefore not esqu as stated in the text itself (Frahm 2018b: note pi-i-i-ri ...; the obverse of the commentary N4 no. 220 seems to comment on the same lines. Cf. the related text Wiggermann 1992: 117 and fig. 8.143 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase KAR 298 and the curative bt mseri. Several elements in this and associated rituals therefore appear to have functioned as a sort of \"quarantine\" , admit - tedly more ritually than medically.62 KAR 298 and its associated rituals include procedures for marking the gate of a patient's house.63 Although such actions were ritualistic, these markings could also have indicated that the home of the patient was that of an afflicted patient under treatment. 6.4 Namburbi-rituals and House Calls: KAL 4 no. 7 and LKA 115 Rituals designed to remove the future effects of an evil omen were called no. 7 and LKA 115 as mamau, the former to release the evil portended and caused by witchcraft65 and the latter to avert the evil portended by any obser - vation made within a man's house (CMAwR ms A; Maul 1994: 446-52, 502ff.). KAL 4 no. 7 may be a copy by Aur -kin- umi from one of Kiir -Aur 's tablets (see below), whereas LKA 115 was copied on the request of Kiir -Aur (\u00fa-a-ir-ma \u00edb-ri), presumably by an apprentice, and thereafter checked by Kiir -Aur . These are the first namburbi-rituals attributed to any career phase with certainty.66 The attestation of namburbi-rituals , whereof LKA 115 was copied 62 Geller (2010: 144) points to the LB commentary SpTU I no. 27 and the omen: \"If a pig enters into the bedroom, a female captive will enter [into] her -ul, wherein bitumen and gypsum are smeared on the threshold of a house (Geller 2016: 314 and note for line 75'). Livingstone (1986: 172-73) edited a commentary in which these substances were identified as Ninurta (gypsum) and the Asakku- demon (bitumen) pursuing each other. SAA 10 no. 238 obv. 12-13 mentions an exorcist combatting an al\u00fb lemnu or Antaubba by hanging \"a mouse and a shoot of a thornbush on the vault of the (patient's) door\" 1993: 189). Smearing substances on the doorposts is also attested in bt rimki (Seidl and Sallaberger 2005-06: 62). Furthermore, drawing figurines on the outer gate in bt mseri would be a visual marker of problems inside the house (Wiggermann 1992: 116). 64 Maul 100; Caplice 1974: 7-13. See also the discussion of other uses of such rituals in Koch 2010: 45-47, 53. 65 Witchcraft could involve the witch sending signs (CMAwR 1: 4 no. 19, written as amall\u00fb eru, was perhaps not a namburbi-ritual, despite its classification by Maul (cf. Maul and Strau\u00df 2011: 13, 48-49). Only very little remains on the obverse and it likely included a passage mentioning \"[...] for a man [...]\" (obv. 1) and something recited before ama (obv. 5). The reverse mentions a vessel 144 Chapter 6 on behalf of Kiir -Aur , could also indicate that Kiir -Aur became a fully - fledged practitioner sometime during his mamau-phase. This is underlined by the inclusion in LKA 115 of a purpose statement (Section 7.4), likely indicat - ing that the tablet was copied for a particular ceremony. KAL 4 no. 7 and LKA 115, alongside all Kiir -Aur 's and his family's other manuscripts containing namburbi-rituals , are analysed in the following two subsections to provide a broader understanding of when such rituals were generally employed and for what purposes. 6.4.1 Namburbi-rituals and Ceremonial Supervisors The namburbi-rituals were mentioned at least once in the EM and must be considered an integral part of the exorcist's duties in official and private contexts.67 Most such rituals are generally well attested and they are directed against many different signs (Koch 2010: 45-47, 53; Maul 1994). Furthermore, the namburbi-rituals were incorporated into a variety of works such as umma lu (Freedman 1998: 12-13). Namburbi-rituals were also written on amulets and used prophylactically.68 Almost all namburbi-rituals from Assur stem from the N4 collection, although none of the amulets with such related rituals from Assur were found in this collection.69 It is currently unknown if namburbi- rituals were considered advanced knowledge,70 but namburbi-rituals were not among the school tablets treated by Gesche. Kiir -Aur does not seem to have practiced namburbi-rituals until he had LKA 115 copied for a performance as mamau and Aur -kin- umi copied KAL 4 no. 7 from a tablet written by Kiir -Aur as mamau. In total, Kiir - Aur is attested in the colophons of at least six namburbi-rituals during his mamau- and mama bt Aur-phases . In comparison, his nephew Kiir - Nab\u00fb copied five namburbi-rituals and his father Nab\u00fb-bssunu at least three. What appears to be the common denominator for all the examples with (rev. 3') and later a figurine thrown into a river (rev. 4') (see ibid.: 49). It may have been another type of ritual, such as KAL 4 no. 41 written by Kiir -Aur as amall\u00fb eru. See also Sections 3.7 and 7.4.1. 67 Maul 1994: 13, 159, 169. KAR 44 obv. UL ka-la, evil\" rites, namburbi-ritual(s) (for) the signs of heaven and earth, as many as there are\". 68 Maul 1994: 13. One amulet with a namburbi-ritual is published in 2013; see also Panayotov 2018a. For amulets, see Hee\u00dfel 2014. 69 Maul 1994: 159 and note 13, 176. The lack of amulets in N4 is likely because they were pro - duced for and kept by the client, unlike the texts kept by the performer. 70 In relation to the EM, this depends on whether or not the second section is analysed as representative of advanced knowledge. See Section 9.4.145 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase colophons is that all namburbi-rituals attested within the Bba- uma-ibni fam- ily seem to stem from their later career phases. Table 10 contains an overview of the attested phases. Keeping in mind that tablets without titles may stem from the mamau eru phase and onwards (Sections 7.2 and 7.4), the evidence here tentatively suggests that namburbi-rituals were not copied, kept or written with colophons until the mamau eru-phase within the Bba- uma-ibni family. Why such rituals do not appear in the Bba- uma-ibni family's earlier material may be due to chance survival, and unfortunately the sample size is too small to gener - alize. Still, a suggestion could be that Kiir -Aur learned the structure of such rituals before his mamau-phase, although he was perhaps not expected to copy namburbi-rituals until he needed them. 6.4.2 Namburbi-rituals and House Calls LKA 115 was written with a purpose statement, which Section 7.4 argues may indicate that the purpose of the text was pragmatic in relation to a ritual per - formance. The ritual within LKA 115 was designed to annul any type of evil omen observed within a man's house. This ritual was therefore broadly appli- cable, and it is difficult to pin the use of such rituals to specific duties.

Due to ominous sightings often occurring in the city or a house, namburbi- rituals were generally closely connected to the terrestrial omen series umma 163-65). Therefore, several of the specific evils to be averted in namburbi- rituals were related to umma lu.71 There exists an overlap between sightings in umma lu and the 1st sub - series of Sa- gig, which is concerned with omens observed en route to and within the patient's house (Freedman 1998: 11-12). Such observations were omi- nous in combination with the patient's symptoms for establishing a diagnosis and prognosis (Hee\u00dfel 2001-02: 24). The omens in Sa- gig's 1st subseries have not previously been considered in the context of namburbi-rituals , perhaps because the main bulk of Sa- gig has occasionally been considered as differ - ent from other areas of stressed that omen collections are expected to have had parallel apo - tropaic rituals, although the surviving evidence indicates to her that omens regarding future events could be treated via namburbi-rituals , whereas diag - nostic and physiognomic omens could not.73 However, this relates to the idea 71 Some examples include sightings of (wild) cats (Freedman 2017: 41ff.) where the nam- burbi-ritual LKA 112 could be used, or sightings of frogs (Freedman 2017: 156ff.) where the namburbi-ritual LKA 118 could be Hee\u00dfel (2000: 81-86; see also uilla-prayers , DINGIR.\u00c0 .DIB .BAs and other such prayers and rituals could be used to appease an angry god causing the illness (see Maul 1988: 25-32; van der Toorn 1985: 123; Lambert 1974). However, as noted by Koch (unpublished: 11 and note 63) Hee\u00dfel does not list namburbi-rituals , and he has actually argued against their use in relation to appeasing divine anger and reconciling a patient with a god (cf. Hee\u00dfel 2007b: 127). Maul (1994: 12-13) mentions namburbi-rituals against, e.g., human illness, but states they are not against physiognomic omens. Koch (unpublished: 11 note 63) suggests the universal namburbis, such as Nab\u00fb-bssunu's LKA 109, could perhaps be used in relation to illness (see Avalos 1995: 136; and notes 68-69) provided a reference to a namburbi-like ritual, which was used to avoid a prognosis stating that the patient will die. See also Lenzi 2011: 24-46. 73 Reiner 1995: 82-85. There were, 274-75) has stressed that divination such as extispicy can be used in relation to both past and future. Guinan regarded divination and magic as hav - ing an inverse relationship in the sense that magic can dissolve what divination reveals (Guinan 2002: 18). For some of the various uses of namburbi-rituals in connection to divi- nation, see Koch 2011: 465. 147 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase that the namburbis influence the diagnosis. Most recently, Koch (unpublished: 11 note 63) has suggested certain namburbis may have played a role in treat - ing the cause of illness. Perhaps they could even affect the illness' prognosis, i.e., the patient's future (Maul 1994: 12), if we assume that the omens from Sa-gig's 1st subseries were sent by divine causers of illness to herald their pres - ence or provide indications concerning the prognosis of the illness. I therefore hypothesize that the terrestrial omens in at least Sa- gig's 1st subseries could Table 11 The Bba- uma-ibni family's namburbi-rituals Name Namburbi-rituals (Partial) Duplicate Evil portended by witchcraftKAR 72 Kiir-Nabu Kiir-Aur KAR 38 Divine anger from poorly executed ritualRA 18 pl. 28 Nab\u00fb-bssunu LKA 113 Evil portended by a bow- LKA 115 Evil portended by any observation in a man's house- LKA 119 Contagion by dust from an evil place- N4 no. 224 (unpublished)Evil portended by a \"curse\" (arratu)- Kiir-Nab\u00fb LKA 110 Evil portended by a lost, broken or missing cylinder seal- LKA 112 Evil portended by certain behaviour of a wildcat - LKA 118 Evil portended by a frog- N4 no. 404 Evil emanating from a man's bed(room?)- Nab\u00fb-bssunu KAL 4 no. 6 Remove alienation between two long separated persons- LKA 109 Universal namburbi - 148 Chapter 6 perhaps be averted or manipulated apotropaically to treat the cause of illness via namburbi-rituals .74 Some of the Bba- uma-ibni family members' namburbi-rituals overlap ter - restrial omens found in umma lu and the 1st subseries of Sa-gig (cf. Veldhuis 1995-96: 152). Table 11 presents the content of the namburbi-rituals with colo - phons naming Bba- uma-ibni family members in order to discuss the possi- ble use of such rituals. At least two of the namburbi-rituals above cover specific instances, which are recorded in the 1st subseries of Sa- gig: Sa-gig tablet 2 line 37: \"If a cat or a mou[se? fill] the floor in the house of a patient: that [pati]ent will die.\" Sa-gig tablet 2 a cat or a [(type -of)]-m[ouse?] fi[ll] the floor in the house of a patient: that patient will live.\" ... Sa-gig tablet 2 line 43: \"If the seal of a patient is lost: that patient will die.\"75 The example from the 2nd tablet line 43 was not cited in umma lu and refers to the loss of the seal of the administrator of a household (Maul 1994: 12, 205, 208). This omen could be removed by Kiir -Nab\u00fb's namburbi-ritual LKA 110. Furthermore, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's LKA 112 concerns the bad omen derived from a wildcat (mura\u00fb) wailing (bak\u00fb), howling (dammu) and continually cross - ing (a path) (Ntn- stem of egru) (Maul 1994: 329-35, esp. 332 and note 32; cf. CAD B: 38). Despite the fact that the omens from Sa- gig concern an ordinary cat (urnu) \"filling the floor\" , almost all namburbi-rituals directed specifically against cats concern omens connected to mura\u00fb- cats , and Maul (1994: 329) only provides one example ( VAT 13988) mentioning a urnu- cat.76 As such, these rituals could relate to such omens as the ones quoted above from Sa- gig. 74 However, Sa-gig, and especially Sa- gig's 1st Hee\u00dfel 2001-02: 32, 38-39. The following quotes consist of a collective reading of the best preserved parts of the various manuscripts in order to provide an overview of the content rather than aim at exact citation: Line 37: DI ina \u00c9 GIG .BI BA .\u00da[]. 76 Note that the 45th tablet of umma lu was devoted to omens concerning urnu- and mura\u00fb- cats (Freedman 2017: 41ff.; Maul 1994: 329 and note 1-3). Maul (1994: 494ff.) only quotes Ass. 13988 (= N4 no. 561) as an example of a namburbi mentioning a urnu- cat, although the ritual is directed against all sorts of bad omens and is a so -called \"uni- versal namburbi-ritual\".149 Kiir-Aur 's mamau-phase In connection to house calls, it is possible that at least two of Kiir -Aur 's namburbi-rituals were broadly applicable for rituals performed in a client's house. LKA 115 could serve to dispel problematic omens experienced in the patient's house, and KAR 38 could serve to protect Kiir -Aur from any wrong - doing on behalf of himself and his assistant(s) while performing a ritual. His father apparently used this ritual as well. Kiir -Nab\u00fb also copied a namburbi- ritual for a bad omen concerning a frog (mua irnu) (LKA 118),77 and evil ema- nating from nocturnal enuresis (N4 no. 404).78 Especially the last ritual could have been useful in connection to a majority of healing ceremonies taking place around the patient's bed. Nab\u00fb-bssunu, in addition to the duplicate above, also copied a ritual to remove alienation between two long separated persons (KAL 4 no. 6) and a so -called universal namburbi-ritual (LKA 109).79 Although several of the namburbi-rituals above do not directly reflect the elimination of bad omens listed in relation to house calls in Sa- gig, it is plau- sible that some of the more general types would have been employed to negate the effect of omens counteractive to the purpose of the visit, i.e., to heal an ill patient, or intended to soothe some of the divine anger behind an illness. If at least some of Kiir -Aur 's namburbi-rituals were connected to making house calls, such as LKA 115, this may fit the hypothesis from Section 6.2, that an exorcist would not lead healing ceremonies connected to house calls until he was mamau. Following this hypothesis, LKA 115 would have been copied on behalf of Kiir -Aur for his ceremony. 77 LKA 118 obv. 1: [... NAM .B\u00daR.B]I UL BIL.ZA.ZA [...]; cf. Maul 1994: 55 note 129. The text is listed in BAK as no. 217, although Hunger simply transliterated pKi-ir-dingir .[x], even though the text copied by Ebeling shows dA[G]. Furthermore, the text in rev. 5' reads: [...] dUTU-D\u00d9 , and the name must have Kiir -Nab\u00fb. 78 LKA 110, see Maul 1994: 202f.; LKA 112, see Maul 1994: 1994: 379ff., 546-47 (copy). The catch-line of LKA 112 refers to a namburbi-ritual against an izbu born in a man's house, such as the one preserved on LKA 114 (= N4 no. 507) with a broken colophon (Maul 1994: 334-337). The tablet could therefore have been written by a member of the Bba- uma- ibni family for a specific purpose (ana abt epi; Maul 1994: 341). Furthermore, the catch-line (= N4 no. 511; Maul 1994: 330ff.), a modified universal namburbi-ritual against mura\u00fb- cat omens, is the first line of LKA 112, and LKA 111 could therefore have been written by, e.g., Kiir -Nab\u00fb. For rituals against enuresis, see also Verderame 2018. 79 KAL 4 no. 6, see also Maul 1994: 409ff.; LKA 109, see Maul 1994: 465ff.150 Chapter 6 6.5 Other Technical Literature: CT 37 pl. 24f. Practice and pragmatic use of the exorcistic knowledge were not the only important aspects of becoming a mamau. In addition to the practical capabilities, exorcists trained to become versed in interpretation of their text corpus. Therefore, contemporary texts focus on the competences needed to become an \"expert\" (umm\u00e2nu), which included understanding the intellectual heritage learned and practiced up until becoming a mamau (Section 9.4). Perhaps, therefore, Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase is the first part of his career wherein he copied a text relating to scholarship. The text CT 37 pl. 24f. is a frag - mentary list (Civil 1969: 87ff., 223ff.).80 Generally, lexical extracts are regarded as educational texts at some level in the first millennium, and the L\u00fa lists may have been employed during the first school phase among the NB and LB tablets.81 However, CT 37 pl. 24f. is not an extract and stems from Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase.82 The content of CT 37 pl. 24f. is probably similar or even related to the 25th tablet of Ur-ra (Civil 1969: 225 ms B).83 The text contains two columns on each side. Each column consists of Sumerian words for a profession and the Akkadian equivalent of that word, with entries divided by a vertical line. The first column of the obverse likely provided Sumerian titles equivalent to br\u00fb and ipu, although it is now broken (ibid.: 227).84 CT 37 pl. 24f. may therefore have been used in some way to emphasize a scholarly identity or read unusual Sumerograms as exorcistic titles via the broken beginning with Sumerian equivalents to the ipu title (see Robson 2011a: 564; Gesche 2001: 130-31). The text includes very elementary glosses and notes to individual words, e.g., spelling out the phonetic reading of a Sumerogram, and these are written in a smaller script.85 Such notes are not commonly found in the N4 texts, but 80 See also Meier 1937-39: 246 note 38. For NA lexical 2014: 354ff. 81 Gesche two lexical exercises and KADP 47 excavated in N4 (Veldhuis 2014: 369-70). Note also that some of the exercises copied on the Graeco - Babylonica tablets were derived from (2001: 63) listed pl. 24f. as an example of a L\u00fa list from Assur in connection to a discussion of school texts. 83 The content of texts such as CT 37 pl. 24f. may have become a separate list in the NB (A -ZU) is listed as br\u00fb in this and other lists. See MSL 12: 119 lines 14'-15' , 227 lines 5'-6'. See Landsberger's comment on this manuscript: it \"gives the impres - sion of a late secondary compilation of rather low quality\" (MSL 12: 230). 85 Col. glosses in 's mamau-phase are also seen on, e.g., Kiir -Nab\u00fb's copy of the EM, KAR 44.86 At Nineveh, such glosses and notes occasionally appear in the royal correspondence in letters and astrological reports, and they have generally been interpreted as educational glosses for the king reading the text.87 However, Talon (2003: 649, 653-54) has shown that the glosses in the royal letters cannot be regarded as proof of the king's schooling and must relate to idiosyncratic habits of a few courtly schol- ars. Several of the glosses in CT 37 pl. 24f. are simplistic readings of common signs and represent knowledge Kiir -Aur must have known as mamau.88 Furthermore, similar glosses are also preserved in other L\u00fa lexical lists from contemporary Nineveh (Civil 1969: 115ff.).89 As a result, it may be that Kiir - Aur used CT 37 pl. 24f. for scholarly activities during his mamau-phase.90 6.6 Summary According to the available evidence, Kiir -Aur did not copy any medical pre - scriptions during his amall\u00fb and amall\u00fb mamau eru-phase. However, his mamau texts attest to treatments of a variety of areas connected to the lower body. The medical texts are directed towards the treatment of \"Anus ill- ness\" , makadu-illness , and the \"strings\" and muscles of the legs and feet. These texts are discussed further in Section 9.1. general, see Krecher 1957-71. 86 KAR 44 obv. 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 21, rev. 32(?). What is noted on Geller's copy and is confirmed via collations is that the initial note to obv. 9 is written on obv. 8, and the final note for obv. 12 is written on obv. 11 (Geller 2000: 245). This cannot presently be explained by problems related to space on the tablet. 87 Veldhuis 2014: 147-48. Concerning some of the scholars at court who wrote such glosses and notes, see Verderame 2014: 725-27. 88 For glosses in a text copied by a amall\u00fb agag\u00fb, see Geller 2010: 130-32; see also Geller 2015. 89 Glosses reading the names of signs in lexical lists appear to be regularly attested in the first millennium (see Krecher 1957-71: 438; see Frahm 2011a: 16-17). At least one gloss listed in a L\u00fa list from Nineveh is also preserved in KAR 44: KAR 44 col. iii 13'). 90 Whether or not such glosses were used explanatory remains uncertain, although Geller (2015: 37) has suggested this was the case for the N4 manuscript KADP 4. This text also listed certain Sumerograms apparently intended to be pronounced in Sumerian (ibid.: 35). The use of notes and glosses in relation to copyists' competence levels requires fur - ther investigation.152 Chapter 6 Although the mamau title indicates that the holder of the title was an exorcist, Kiir -Aur does not seem to have been an independent and fully trained practitioner when he gained this title. This chapter has argued that Kiir -Aur did not make house calls on his own until he had copied and acquired a special ritual for going to the patient's house (KAR 230). The pur - pose of this ritual was to remove the cause of illness, possibly at the begin- ning of any treatment at a patient's house. The text was labelled as secret and, although it cannot be determined what this meant, it is not impossible that the phrase illustrated the Bba- uma-ibni family's view that this text was spe - cial to them. Kiir -Aur 's father, Nab\u00fb-bssunu, also copied a related text, KAR 31, designed to protect the exorcist when approaching a patient. These texts combined therefore attest to a professional environment in relation to making house calls. Kiir -Aur 's KAR 298 from his mamau-phase was designed for prophy - lactically protecting a person's home via figures of magical beings. The text was likely aimed at practical adaption, and could have served as an aide m\u00e9moire for such rituals. The text was associated with bt mseri and other rituals for demarcating spaces and protecting them either for apotropaic or treatment purposes. Kiir -Nab\u00fb's associated texts related to the tummu btu incantation attest to an environment dealing with demarcating rituals. These rituals there - fore were adaptable and likely point to another side of Kiir -Aur 's practice, namely providing ritual quarantine for patients when healing them. This chapter also evaluates Kiir -Aur 's production of namburbi-rituals , which appear to have begun around his mamau-phase. As a result, these texts seem to be linked to the ritual performance. Kiir -Aur was perhaps not a ceremonial supervisor before he copied KAR 230, and by extension, he did not copy namburbi-rituals previously. In addition, this chapter argues that the namburbi-rituals copied by the Bba- uma-ibni family in general may have been used to treat certain omens, such as those preserved in the 1st subseries of Sa-gig. Whether or not such rituals could be used in connection to such omens remains hypothetical, but, if they were indeed used, they would have been part of the appeasement of the divine cause behind an illness. However, further evidence is needed to corroborate this suggestion. The final section discusses Kiir -Aur 's sole lexical text CT 37 pl. 24., which may have played a role in relation to his scholarly work at the time or for strengthening his professional identity.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 008 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.Chapter 7 Additional Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase This chapter contains a discussion of tablets that based on text -internal criteria, may be assigned to the mamau- or mama bt Aur-phases of Kiir -Aur 's career.1 At least 14 of Kiir -Aur 's tablets do not provide his professional title and as many as 16 texts contain breaks in the colophons where a potential title would have been. As such, these tablets cannot be distributed properly to Kiir -Aur 's various career phases at present. However, certain features in the colophons can be used to propose a tentative assignment of some of these texts to certain career phases proximal to the mamau-phase. Furthermore, the only dated tablet by Kiir -Aur , and the Bba- uma-ibni family in general, KAR 267, is found among the tablets without titles, and this text will be dis - cussed in order to assign this text to a section of Kiir -Aur 's career. Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase tablet LKA 115 is the first text from any career phase that employs what will be referred to here as a \"purpose statement\". I use this term to refer to statements, which designate that the tablet was pro - duced \"for undertaking a (ritual) procedure\" (ana ab epi). By extension, such phrases are indicative of the texts' pragmatic purpose (e.g., Maul 2010a: 212-13; Hunger 1968: 12, 19-20). Outside of career phases, such statements are also found in nine of Kiir -Aur 's tablets without titles and in seven tablets with broken colophons. The present chapter argues that such statements are useful as a distributive criterion. Several manuscripts, including Kiir -Aur 's only commentary -like text without a title, BAM 307, also indicate they were copied at the request of Kiir -Aur ([\u00fa- ]a-ir-ma). Therefore, this chapter also discusses Kiir -Aur 's use of assistants to copy relevant material. 7.1 Omission and Inclusion of Titles The written name serves the purpose of remembrance, claiming ownership over the text as an object, or providing authority (Maul 2010a: 215 and note 94; Radner 2005: 70, 169). Perhaps for this reason, several of Kiir -Aur 's colophons 1 The title mama bt Aur \"Exorcist of the Aur temple\" designates the last traceable phase of Kiir -Aur 's career, which appears after his mamau-phase. It is treated in Chapter 8.154 Chapter 7 include the phrase: \"Do not erase my written name\".2 Titles are additional ele - ments that reference the level of competence within the professional group of which a copyist or writer was part.3 All this information was stored in the colophons. The purposes of colophons differ over time, place and within indi- vidual careers, as discussed in Section 1.1 153-54; Hunger 1968: 1, 15ff.; Leichty 1964: 147). However, while a copy frequently presents itself as the transmission of an ideally static textual tradition, Stevens (2013: 212) stated that the colophons must have served as the textual area for individual schol- arly touch wherein scribes could practice \"free choice over form and content\".4 Still, Stevens (2013: 220 note 54) argued that colophons from advanced levels of scholarship tend to be more elaborate than earlier colophons, but in general this is not true of Kiir -Aur 's colophons with titles. Although the reasons for the addition or omission of titles in colophons is uncertain, a fair assumption may be that it depended on the audience, i.e., who was supposed to read the product in the present and future. Titles were included for both the scribe and his ancestors, although many works - some of which were integrated and preserved in tablet collections - were not supplied with a colophon at all (Hunger 1968: 9-11; Leichty 1964: 153). Comparative NB and LB material suggests that student or apprenticeship titles were not used during education before the professional specialization (Gesche 2001: 153ff., 213).5 The question is therefore whether or not Kiir -Aur could or would omit his apprenticeship title during his earlier attested phases. During his later career stages the purposes of the text may be indicative of who was supposed 2 amall\u00fb eru title: BAM 9, RA 15 pl. 76, RA 40 pl. 116; mama bt Aur title: Beckman and Foster 1988 no. 21, LKA 77. For quotations, see Appendix 1. It is unclear if names could actu- ally be removed from tablets by applying, e.g., water to the colophon (see Taylor 2011: 19, 22; van de Mieroop 2006: 274, concerning erasing names from inscriptions). Maul (1994: 221) discusses the possibility that adding a name and stating that the person with this name wrote the tablet could bestow a benign divine effect on the copyist. 3 By extension, a title communicates professional credentials and identity to the reader. However, the recipient of a text, i.e., its reader(s), may have changed from text to text. 4 See also Rochberg 2004: 211. Yet, Stevens (2013: 212 note 6) argues the LB Uruk colophons show order in variation of elements, wording and sign choices in the colophon (see Robson 2011a: 566-69; cf. Lenzi 2008a: 206). 5 Gesche (2001: seems to differentiate between school and library tablets' colophons in the sense that the former were often dedicatory and the latter contained \"Bibliotheksvermerken\". As such, especially the NB school texts donated to the Nab\u00fb-a-ar\u00ea temple in Babylon were dedicated to this temple and colophons likely functioned as votive objects in the temple (George 2003-04: 404; Gesche 2001: 153, 155, 158-60). Copying traditional texts may occasionally have been considered a service to the gods.155 Additional Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase to read it, and consequently, whether or not a title was necessary. Perhaps certain \"quickly extracted\" tablets with purpose statements were produced rapidly (Maul 2010a: 213-14, 216). One possible result of the time constraints and the pragmatic purpose of such texts may have been that the copyist wrote minimalistic colophons. Generally, texts copied during various training phases probably served the dual purpose of posing as an exercise in copying as well as providing a basis for practical training.6 Nonetheless, the standard of amall\u00fb eru manuscripts must occasionally have been high, since there are several examples of such manuscripts being integrated into contemporary text collections (see Robson 2014: 152-53).7 This is one possible reason why several of Kiir -Aur 's elaborate colophons appear during his amall\u00fb eru-phase. If so, the colophon likely served the purpose of creating an image of Kiir -Aur as a skilled apprentice. Still, Kiir -Aur may also have produced manuscripts without colophons, and the purpose of the colophon is therefore not always clear. The recipient(s) of many of Kiir -Aur 's texts with colophons is uncertain. Nevertheless, even tablets with purpose statements were likely integrated into the tablet collection (Maul 1994: 169), although it is unknown if they were used after the specific ritual for which they were copied. Maul (2010a: 215) suggests the accumulation of tablets into a collection could be regarded as a means of identification of personal qualifications for individuals such as Kiir -Aur . It may be that tablets without titles stem from later career phases in which the tablets would only be used by Kiir -Aur , e.g., with purpose statements in relation to a ritual, or that Kiir -Aur did not need a title to boost his image in particular texts. However, this remains speculative. The fact remains that Kiir -Aur included a title in the majority of his colophons for reasons that are often unclear. I therefore find it unlikely that Kiir -Aur would have copied, e.g., amall\u00fb eru tablets with colophons that omit both his title and the a Nab\u00fb (Section 212-13. 7 Whether these new copies were dedicated to the library as part of the training, they replaced older manuscripts, or were dedicated to, e.g., Nab\u00fb in connection with being placed in the library typically cannot be determined (cf. Clancier 2014: 46; the NB school tablets from Babylon were often schoolwork, they were still kept in the temple as part of the floor filling, likely because they were dedi- cated to Nab\u00fb on behalf of the future scribe (Cavigneaux 1999a: 388). Maul (2010: 217), how - ever, stressed that some N4 tablets without colophons contain poor spellings and a bad script (see Robson 2014: 154).156 Chapter 7 7.2 Tablets without Kiir-Aur's Professional Title There are in total 15 tablets without titles that may have belonged to Kiir - Aur 's mamau-phase or later. It is unclear why these colophons do not mention his title explicitly, especially because some of the colophons do men- tion the titles of his forefathers. In addition to an overview of Kiir -Aur 's tablets without titles, this section includes a summary of textual features that are useful for suggesting possible phases wherein these tablets were copied. Table 12 contains an overview of the texts, divided into three groups according to the content of the texts, namely: medical texts, ritual texts, and texts relating to other areas of technical literature. The diagnosis and prescription texts were directed against head maladies (BAM 9), a specific eye illness (BAM 351),8 internal problems connected to the spleen(?) (BAM 78),9 the lower body illness aau and associated ness (BAM 131), and finally feet maladies (BAM 121).10 Several tablets only contain incantations or prayers,11 whereas others contain both incantations and rituals to combat ghosts (KAR 21, KAR 267), a diagnosis and an incanta- tion ritual against an \"Adversary\" (bl dabbi, KAR and ritual actions against a \"Curse\" (mmtu, KAL 10 no. 5), and a long and unpublished namburbi-ritual against another type of curse (arratu, N4 no. 224, see Section 6.4.2).12 KAL 10 no. 1 provides incantation incipits and ritual instructions as guidelines for performing a long ritual against a \"Curse\". The text there - fore appears similar in scope to the amall\u00fb manuscript N4 no. 175 and the mamau manuscript KAR 298. Note that the text contains a with a previously unattested Sumerian- Akkadian bilingual incantation for washing the mouth (KA LU ) on a statue of the king made from various materials. Finally, BAM 307 was likely a scholastic manuscript containing the right side of a commentary -like text, as discussed below. 8 Birrat n, see or perhaps \"pancreas\"(?). See Westenholz 2010 for a discussion. Regarding the initial diagnosis in BAM 78, see also a commentary related to the Ugu series, 11N- T4, in Civil 1974: 336-37 line 6. 10 BAM 121 may have opened with prescriptions for the head, temples or the epigastrium, obv. 1: DI NA SAG [...]/SAG .[KI ...]/SAG 40 and N4 no. 228(?). BAM 333 is broken and may have contained a ritual instruction, and N4 no. 228 remains unpublished. 12 According to Frankena (1960: 174) several lines in the ritual can be found in parallel pas - sages in urpu tablet 3 and 8. However, the relevant lines in urpu concern mmtu- curse. It is possible that AMC line 87 had to do with arratu lemuttu (Steinert 2018d: 256).157 Additional Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase Table 12 Texts without Kiir -Aur 's professional title Group Text Content Format and description Medical texts BAM 9 (See Sections 3 and 5.4) BAM 78 Obverse: two prescriptions against a hurting spleen (ulmu) where the patient cannot sleep, his body has a fever, he eats and drinks increasingly less and he continually seeks out Marduk's sanctuary (obv. 1-3, 7) where the patient on an empty stomach is to suck down a liquid (obv. 1-6) or eat a remedy (obv.

The text contains a date formula dating it to the 9th of the month Ullu (August - September) in 658 BCE.13 As this tablet is the only one of Kiir -Aur 's texts that can be isolated to a specific moment in time, it is crucial to discuss KAR 267 in relation to Kiir -Aur 's career (see Section 7.5). 7.2.1 Text-internal Features Useful as Allocating Criteria Several features within the texts and their colophons can be used to argue for a distribution of the texts in Table 12 to career phases. Nine tablets contain a purpose statement similar to several of Kiir -Aur 's mamau and mama bt Aur tablets14 and they probably served a similar purpose. BAM 307 also states that someone other than Kiir -Aur copied this tablet at the request of Kiir -Aur , which is a feature only found among his amall\u00fb eru, mamau, and mama bt Aur tablets.15 Considering that Kiir -Aur did not copy prescriptions in attested tablets between his amall\u00fb eru- and mamau eru-phase, several of the tab - lets above may belong to the earliest or later phases based on their content. However, this remains speculative. Namburbi-rituals are not attested with certainty before Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase, and N4 no. 224 may therefore belong to this or subsequent phases (see Section 6.4.1). Furthermore, Kiir - Aur 's texts related to the palace or the Aur cult can be argued to originate in his mamau- or mama bt Aur-phases (see Sections 7.3.1 and 8.6). Thus, it seem plausible that the ritual N4 no. 228 for washing the mouth of a statue of the king himself would belong to one of these phases. Regardless, there are tablets without titles, which seem to resemble tablets copied by Kiir -Aur as amall\u00fb eru, such as the uilla-prayer copied on LKA 40.16 However, the addi- tion of a purpose statement in the case of LKA 40 argues against assigning this text to Kiir -Aur 's earlier phases.17 13 Maul 2010a: 205. 14 tablets are: BAM 78, BAM 121, BAM 333, BAM 351, KAl 10 no. 1, KAR 21, KAR 171, LKA 40, N4 no. 228. 15 One of Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase tablets was likely copied by another well known N4 individual, Aur -kin- umi, and is published as the tablet KAL 4 no. 7 (see Maul 2010a: 216; Section 6.4). For a recently published tablet from the hand of Aur -kin- umi, see Fadhil 2018. 16 The uilla-prayer LKA 40 was copied without a ritual and directed towards Tamtum (Frechette 2012: 263, 273). The tablet layout and text are similar to Kiir -Aur 's LKA 43 copied as amall\u00fb eru. 17 Other examples from N4 of prayers for preparation of a ritual contain the names of the patient, e.g., LKA 51. However, the majority of such tablets do not contain a colophon (Maul 2010a: 213 note 82). 161 Additional Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase At least BAM 9 seems to be from Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase as argued in Section 5.4. Both BAM 9 and BAM 121 contain the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase, and BAM 121 also contains a purpose statement. As discussed in Section 5.4, the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase was an addition that Kiir -Aur , according to present evidence, added to his amall\u00fb eru- and amall\u00fb mamau eru-phases . It is therefore possible that BAM 9 and BAM 121 were copied at this time.18 If this is correct, BAM 121 would be the earliest tablet with a purpose statement copied by Kiir -Aur , and furthermore it would have been copied before his mamau-phase while including medical prescriptions, which are otherwise not observed in the amall\u00fb and amall\u00fb mamau eru phases. The assignment of BAM 121 thus remains uncertain. 7.3 Tablets with Broken Colophons A group of seven tablets contain breaks in the colophon and consequently these texts cannot be attributed to a specific career phase, regardless of whether or not the colophon originally contained a title. An additional 11 texts contain breaks in the names, preventing their distribution between Kiir -Aur or Kiir - Nab\u00fb. However, all these texts are listed in what follows to enable the fullest possible overview of texts that may be attributed to Kiir -Aur . Furthermore, several of these texts contain features that are useful for distributing them to phases of Kiir -Aur 's career. The diagnostic-therapeutic texts concern illnesses affecting the respiratory system and the arms (BAM 40), various types of stiffness, muscle and inter - nal illnesses (BAM 68), various demons affecting the state of mind and epi- gastrium or abdomen (BAM 311), insanity (BAM 202), witchcraft (BAM 206), and a text for making a patient drunk or thirsty (BAM 260), possibly aimed at improving the effect of alcohol and alleviating pain in connection to medical procedures (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 361; Geller and Cohen 1995: 1813 and note 26).

Such a division of name and title across two lines is attested in, e.g., BAM 164 and BAM 177, although I avoid restoration in KAL 9 no. 41 as nothing indicates that a title was written in rev. 5'.166 Chapter 7 incantations and instructions in preparation of going to an audience in a pal- ace (KAL 7 no. 24; Stadhouders 2013: 305-11), and a prayer to a divinity who may have been Girra (N4 no. 443). Furthermore, LKA 137 consists of a prayer, a ritual and an illustrative drawing for preparing a stone omen ritual (psephomancy).19 Additionally, there are three texts that cannot be categorized properly within the previous groups: an unpublished literary extract or text (N4 no. 401), a slim two -columned list of amulet stones with designations in the margins of the number available within the collection (BAM 366; Schuster -Brandis 2008: 189f. with notes, 218 note 512), and ACh Supp. 2 24 from Nineveh that provides a commentary on the first paragraph of the 20th tablet of Enma Anu Enlil concerning eclipses (Rochberg 1988: 176, 225-27; see Section 7.6). N4 A 2362 is presumably too broken to determine the content. 7.3.1 Text-internal Features Useful as Allocating Criteria Several of the tablets discussed above cannot be attributed to a career phase with any certainty, and must be classified as tablets written by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb at an uncertain stage of their career.20 Other texts can be argued to stem from certain phases based on text -internal features. As in the group without titles, a number of the tablets with broken colophons include purpose statements that enable a distribution to later career phases.21 Similarly, BAM 206 was labelled as an IM.G\u00cdD .DA , which were only used during Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb mamau eru- and mamau-phases in the surviving evidence. KAL 7 no. 24 likely had a broken title after Kiir -Aur 's name. Meinhold (2017: 62) reconstructed his title as [MA.MA], and it is relatively certain that the tablet cannot have contained more than two broken signs (ibid.: 164-65, 194-95). The content ) and such incantations generally focus on how to get access to legal authorities and avert - ing any dangers by doing so (Stadhouders 2013: 305-11; see Stadhouders and Panayotov 2018 for similar texts from N4). Considering that rituals against an \"Adversary\" (bl dabbi), be it magically or legally, appear on a tablet without a title (KAR 171) that also contains a purpose statement, and that such legal connotations are found associatively through 19 Lambert 2007: -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb: BAM 260, KAL 4 no. 37, KAR 90. 21 The broken tablets with purpose statements are: BAM 68, BAM 202, BAM 311, KAL 9 no. 41, KAR 90, N4 no. 443. It is unclear if the intitial line in the colophon of BAM 206 is a purpose statement, see Ch. 8 note 84.167 Additional Texts that May Belong to mamau-phase -mouth \" kadabbed\u00fb in from his mama bt Aur-phase, it is likely KAL 7 no. 24 stems from at least his mamau-phase.22 However, it is unclear if KAL 7 no. 24 was designed to grant Kiir -Aur himself or his clients an audience.23 Other texts provide clues for their distribution as well. Section 6.3 discusses the use of house demarcating rituals during Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase. Therefore, the text relating to bt mseri (N4 no. 254) may belong to Kiir - Aur 's mamau-phase, although he also copied guidelines for this ritual as amall\u00fb (N4 no. 175). Kiir -Aur 's ritual for obtaining a stone omen LKA 137 is listed in the first section of the EM.24 However, it is uncertain during what phase Kiir -Aur copied the text, although the content was copied from a cer - tain Nab\u00fb-[...]'s IM.G\u00cdD .DA eru- or mamau-phase.25 The commentary ACh Supp. 2 24 is discussed in Section 7.6. 7.3.2 Excursus: Inventory Texts from the N4 Collection BAM 366 is a two -columned list of amulet stones wherein each entry is marked with a number, which possibly indicates how many stones were pres - ent in the stock taker's collection (Schuster -Brandis 2008: 189f. with notes). Unfortunately, the colophon is too broken to determine if the tablet was writ - ten by Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb, and whether or not it contained a title. I have chosen to discuss this manuscript here alongside two similar texts in relation to Kiir -Aur 's tablets without titles or with broken colophons. It remains uncertain if BAM 366 was written at some stage of apprentice - ship, in which the apprentice took note while his father took stock, or if the stock taker was a fully educated specialist. The text likely lists the stones and numbers available at a specific point in time. In total, the list states that the N4 collection included 315 stones (BAM 366 rev. 18'), divided into many types, and there were as many as 14 stones of some types (BAM 366 obv. 5). The colophon totals the entire tablet and states: 22 Note that kadabbed\u00fb was also treated in Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru manuscript BAM 201. 23 Kiir -Aur was likely not involved in the Aur cult before he became mama bt Aur (Section 8.1). If KAL 7 no. 24 was designed to grant him entrance to, e.g., the palace and the king, the text may have belonged to his late mamau-phase, as this use of the text would indicate he was partially involved in rituals pertaining to the state during this phase. 24 KAR 44 rev. 25: \"(Omen) decision by stars, birds, oxen, goats (and) stone oracular utter - ance of pi-i IM.G\u00cdD .DA p.dPA-[...]. 168 Chapter 7 A total of 315 stones (for) 'neck -(amulet(s))' of Marduk, which are suitable for use, placed [in? ...], the tablets [x(?)] Kiir -[Aur/Nab\u00fb ...].26 As discussed in Section 7.4, the tablets with purpose statements must have been used in relation to preparing rituals. If so, practical application must have required access to the material prescribed in the texts. Comparable sources from other periods illustrate that specific (prepared) drugs could be kept in jars upon which the name of the malady it cured was incised (Walker 1980). Inventory texts, such as BAM 366, may therefore reflect items kept in the N4 house at some point in the 7th century. Although the few objects found in the N4 house cannot presently be connected to performative practices, BAM 366 and one additional text attest to these aspects of the family trade.27 Furthermore, a third text can be added, which illustrates that the family also had an interest in taking stock of texts. The second text is KADP 36. The manuscript was excavated in the N4 col- lection and does not contain a colophon (Peders\u00e9n 1986 N4 no. 136). This six- columned text lists an impressive 177 drugs whereof 159 are of vegetable origin (B\u00f6ck 2011: 702). The tablet was likely organized to provide an overview of what medicaments were in store by giving running totals, and adding specific refer - ences to where the ingredients were located (B\u00f6ck 2010d: 164). A few examples read: \"[A total] (of) 15 (different) ingredients, (located) on the first wooden beam from above\" , and \"A total of 17 (different) ingredients, (located) on the third wooden beam\". 28 Clearly, the owners of the N4 house kept track of their supplies and had the necessary medicaments to perform the rituals needed.29 26 BAM 366 col. iv 18'-22': PAP -ma 172). For the translation of a ana qti \u00fb, see CMAwR 2: 416 with further references; CMAwR 1: 64, 121; Reiner 1961: 10 note 1; see discussion in Ch. 6 note 25. It seems likely that the DI is a mistake for d!Mar-duk, possibly indicating a cultic context. 27 For the archaeological finds in N4, see Miglus 1996: 236-41. 28 KADP 36 col. giPA 1 AN .[T]A -te H: 155). ina giPA 3-te . In col. iv 25 storage vessels are mentioned. The drugs are described as stored in the upper, second, third, etc. shelf (au), roasting vessel (qltu/kar pat qalte) or placed in bowls (qabtu) (see B\u00f6ck in press; K\u00f6cher 1955: 10). The term au is commonly translated as \"shelf\" in relation to this text, although the term has a range of literal meanings, such as \"sceptre, staff, stick, branch\" (CAD : 153). Therefore, B\u00f6ck (in press) argues that au should be translated into German as \"stock\" , referring to wooden beams that likely provided support for the roof as part of the house. The various ingredients would possibly have been hung from these to dry. In lack of a bet - ter term, I translate it as \"wooden beam\" here. 29 A study of the correlation between both texts and the ingredients used in the N4 ritu- als and prescriptions is beyond the scope of the present work, but is worthy of future 169 Additional Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase A third text ( VAT 13723+) from N4 lists various text series and their individual tablets by incipits, and in the margins the scribe presumably provided notes on the number of manuscripts kept in the collection (Geller 2000: 226ff., text A). As such, this text illustrates that multiple copies likely existed in the N4 collec- tion of several tablets within a series, but that the users were perhaps not always aware of the numbers until they took stock (see Maul 2010a: 215 note 93).30 7.4 The mamau-phase and Purpose Statements Kiir -Aur 's mamau tablet LKA 115 is the first tablet from a career phase that contains a purpose statement. However, such statements also occur in his mama bt Aur-phase tablets and on tablets without titles. All these texts are discussed in what follows in order to argue why several of Kiir -Aur 's tablets without titles can be assigned to his mamau- or mama bt Aur-phases . LKA 115 was also copied at the request of Kiir -Aur (\u00fa-a-ir-ma), and such tablets are also discussed as an allocating criterion. This study refers to phrases expressed as ana abt epi \"for undertaking a (ritual) procedure\" as purpose statements.31 In general, such phrases are especially attested in Assur and they are frequently coupled with statements that refer to the content as \"quickly, hastily extracted\" (ani/zamar nasu).32 This expression likely designates that the content of the tablet was copied in order to ensure the correct preparation and performance of a specific ritual research. Equally interesting is the possible economic aspect of such ingredients, which also requires further investigation, but see preliminarily Myer 1975: 137ff. 30 Although the text is not a catalogue, as such, it does list numbers of individual texts of series in relation to the N4 collection (Schwemer 2017: 50-51; of the fol- lowing ways: a-na/ana a-bat/DAB -Aur KAR 38 ( mama bt Aur) differs slightly, but relates to the purpose of the text. KAR 38 rev. 41: a-na use of the term \"purpose statement\" here differs slightly from the largely didactic and votive examples illustrated by Peace (1993). 32 The exact nuances of ani and zamar/amar in relation to nasu are difficult to evaluate.170 Chapter 7 or 212-13, 216; Bott\u00e9ro 1983:159; Hunger 1968: 12).33 However, the exact role of the tablet in relation to a ritual context cannot be specified.34 Contemporary letters corroborate that tablets were in fact copied in order to perform certain rituals: I shall now look up, collect and copy numerous - 20 to 30 - canonical and non- canonical tablets, (but) perform (the prayers) (only) tomorrow evening and on the night of the 15th day. SAA 10 no. 24035 The quoted letter also suggests that relevant tablets could be copied quickly and in great quantity.36 Other letters from Nineveh suggest that several tablets with rituals were copied in their entirety as concrete instructions for some per - formances (Robson 2019: 118-119). When such tablets were quickly copied in preparation for a ritual, an assistant may have copied the tablet(s) needed for the ceremonial supervisor (see Section 6.1). 7.4.1 Kiir-Aur's Tablets with Purpose Statements A total of 19 tablets with a purpose statement can be assigned to Kiir -Aur throughout his career, which can be divided into three groups: at least one text from Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase, eight texts from his mama bt Aur-phase, nine without a title, and and an additional text with a broken 33 The verb abtu was also used to describe the actions associated with editorial activities. Esagil-kn-apli's and Assurbanipal's editorial activities were described as SUR.GIBIL (= zar\u00fb, z\u00e2ru or a-ra-a(?)) abtu, understood literally as: \" to undertake a new plying, spin- ning, weaving\" and relates to the process of producing or receiving a \"new edition\" of a text (Frahm 98-99, no. 321 line 3; see also this term the act, i.e., \"to undertake work\" (CAD : 21,5). Thus, ana abt epi of specific performance\" in CAD (E: 195,1c1'). 34 Some N4 tablets for preparation of rituals included the name of the patient, e.g., LKA 51 without a colophon, and these examples indicate that such tablets played a concrete purpose in the ritual preparations (see Maul 2010a: 213 note 82). 35 SAA 10 no. 240 obv. 23-rev . 2 in Parpola 1993: 191. See also 1994: 31-32, 34; SAA 10 no. 245 rev. 12-18 in Parpola 1993: 195. 36 The letter SAA 10 no. 255 states that \"the tablets are too numerous\" to be copied in time for the ritual, which argues against the idea of quickly copying tablets in great quantity (Parpola 1993: 201-2).171 Additional Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase title.37 Furthermore, six texts written by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb during uncertain career phases statements.38 Generally, Kiir -Aur 's ana abt epi tablets also contain a statement conveying that they were \"(quickly) extracted\" , attesting to the urgency of their production.39 Section 6.2 suggested that Kiir -Aur likely began supervising healing cer - emonies during his mamau-phase, when he copied KAR 230. Additionally, namburbi-rituals seem to appear in his corpus of texts around this time, pos - sibly indicating a connection. LKA 115 represents a namburbi-ritual with a pur - pose statement and stems from Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase. As a result, the purpose statements seem to designate that the tablet in question was copied when Kiir -Aur was at a level at which he was allowed to supervise a ritual performance. By extension, he must have been around the level of mamau. As discussed above, it is likely that writing his title on tablets was not always a necessity for Kiir -Aur . However, he is assumed to have included it regularly until his mamau-phase. Maul (2010a: 213) commented on N4 tablets that the reason was probably because it was the mas - ter's domain to provide the cure and that it was his responsibility to ensure that mistakes in the text did not induce fatal consequences. Maul's suggestion supports the hypothesis formulated here.40 In relation to this hypothesis, it is therefore noteworthy that Maul and Strau\u00df (2011: 49) reconstructed the final line in Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru tablet KAL 4 no. 19 with a purpose statement: 37 Mamau: LKA 115; mama bt 177, 186, BAM 188, BAM 300, KAR 38 (see Ch. 8 note 84), KAR 374; without titles: BAM 78, BAM 333, BAM 351, KAL 10 no. 1, KAR 21, KAR 171, LKA 40, N4 no. 228; without title, but including the a Nab\u00fb tuk - lassu-phrase: BAM 121; possibly broken title: KAL 10 no. 13. See Appendix 1. It remains uncer - tain if KAR 298 contained a purpose statement (cf. Wiggermann 1992: 41; Hunger 1968: 70 no. 201 ms 38 BAM 68, BAM 202, BAM 311, KAL 9 no. 41, KAR 90, N4 no. 443. It is unclear if the first line in the colophon of BAM 206 is a purpose statement, see Ch. 8 note 84. For BAM 68, see Table 13 note a. 39 The phase is usually written (ani/zamar) issua/nasa (ZI-a) or simply zamar before other statements (see Section 9.2). 40 The first of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts with this phrase also stem from his mamau-phase (KAR 22, KAR 56). However, Maul (1994: 159 note 18) suggests that tablets with the ani nasa \"hastily extracted\" remark could also have been used to perform the ritual inscribed, although such tablets could also have been copied to enhance the collection (ibid.: 160). In relation to a discussion of the amall\u00fb eru tablets that were \"quickly\" copied, Maul (2010a: 216) proposed that such tablets could have played a role in the preparation of the ritual. This remains uncertain.172 Chapter 7 KAL 4 no. 19 rev. 8': [(ana abt epi) ani] is-su-a41 In my view, there is insufficient space on the tablet for this reconstruction. Considering the original size of the tablet, I doubt the line would have held more than four smaller signs before is-su-a.42 Thus, I would suggest recon- structing [a-an-i].43 As a result, no surviving Kiir -Aur colophon with a title indicates that purpose statements were used by Kiir -Aur before he became mamau.44 Following these hypotheses, the implication is that Kiir -Aur would typically have copied tablets with purpose statements, but excluding titles, somewhere around his mamau- or mama bt Aur-phases , likely after the implementation of KAR 230. This observation can be applied to the tab - lets with purpose statements in general, i.e., they are assigned to Kiir -Aur 's mamau and mama bt Aur tablets. However, BAM 121 contains both the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase as well as a purpose statement.45 Section 5.4 suggests that Kiir -Aur used the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phase before he became mamau eru. Therefore, BAM 121 may have been the first purpose statement tablet cop - ied by Kiir -Aur before he became mamau. This issue cannot be resolved. 7.4.2 Tablets Copied on Behalf of Kiir-Aur LKA 115, containing a ritual against any evil omen observed in a man's house, stems from Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase and it is also the first of three tablets from Kiir -Aur 's later phases that were likely copied by someone other than Kiir -Aur , perhaps an assistant at some unknown career stage,46 and thereaf- ter checked by 41 Alternatively, they propose the reading ana mupiti (Maul and Strau\u00df 2011: 49). This possibility is also dismissed here. 42 I collated the tablet ( VAT 14005) in Berlin during the summer of 2016. 43 Kiir -Aur has several examples of colophons in which the last line only contains the phrase ani/zamar nasu, see BAM 81, BAM 186, BAM 351, LKA 43, LKA 89+(?). 44 Note again the problematic BAM 121 with a purpose statement, and possibly from before Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase (Section 5.4). 45 The tablet is labelled a uppu, but it is the only one among Kiir -Aur 's uppus that is in landscape format (see Appendix 1). Tablets with landscape format are only missing from Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb-phase. 46 Maul 2010a: 216-17; Maul 1994: 32.173 Additional Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase Written (and) checked like its original. For undertaking a (ritual) proce - dure (of) Kiir -Aur , the mamau. He had someone copy (the text), and he checked (it). The -stem of aru and G- stem of bar\u00fb indicates that Kiir -Aur had the content copied on his request and he checked it himself. Considering all of Kiir -Aur 's tablets, someone copied at least three further tablets on behalf of Kiir -Aur: N4 no. 241 from Kiir -Aur without a title, BAM 99 from Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase.47 While N4 no. 241 was argued in Section 3.7.3 to represent Kiir -Aur 's duties as a tutor during his earliest phase, both BAM 99 and LKA 115 contain mamau and mama bt Aur titles and they were provided with purpose statements, which, as argued above, are an indicator for a later career phase.48 These later texts likely attest to Kiir -Aur being in a position in which junior assistants would aid him in the preparations (and performance?) of rituals. Additionally, BAM 307 can also be assigned to at least Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase on the basis of its content and the lack of a title (Section 7.6). Whether the later texts copied on behalf of Kiir -Aur also functioned as exercises for the younger copyist remains uncertain, although this seems to have been the case in N4 no. 241 (cf. Clancier 2014: 56). Nonetheless, it is note - worthy that Kiir -Aur still labelled the text as his own and that it did not include the copyist's name. Based on the discussions above, it therefore seems unlikely that tablets without titles that include purpose statements should belong to Kiir -Aur 's earliest phases. Whatever tablets Kiir -Aur may have copied for his father's performances are therefore not regarded here as being those with Kiir -Aur 's name and purpose statements. 7.4.3 Purpose Statements and Notes on Breaks Kiir -Aur copied at least three tablets with notes in the text stating that the original copied from contained breaks. Such notations appear as epi/pi \"it is broken\" or not necessarily an ana abt epi tablet, as the signs before Kiir -Aur 's name are broken. 48 No texts copied on behalf of Kiir -Nab\u00fb are known. Kiir -Nab\u00fb may not have reached the level mama bt Aur, perhaps because Assur fell to the Babylonians and Medes during his mamau-phase, i.e., around 614 BCE (see Maul 2010a: 204, 209-11). See Section 2.3.3.174 Chapter 7 2012: 25-27). In comparison, Kiir -Nab\u00fb copied at least three such tablets with similar notes. These texts are presented in Table 14. Considering all of Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts listed above, epi-notes appear mamau (KAR 56), and mama bt Aur-phases (BAM 99). Furthermore, several of the texts from later phases include purpose statements (BAM 99, BAM 311, KAR 56). As shown in Section 3.3.1, the passage with these notes on breaks in Kiir -Aur 's N4 no. 237 duplicate the same pas - sage in Kiir -Nab\u00fb's KAR 56, and the notes on breaks are almost identical. Thus, the texts were likely copied from the same original, which may have been a damaged writing -board. Clancier (2014: 53-55) considered the as examples illustrating a student's ability to copy accurately, although such texts were essentially difficult to implement in practice.49 Worthington (2012: 26), on the other hand, has questioned the argument that epi- statements repre - sent careful transmission in order to avoid restoration, and he argued the exis - tence of several examples of ancient careless restorations from especially the first millennium. Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase tablet BAM 129 contains consecutive rows of entries that are also found on a tablet possibly related to the therapeutic Ugu series (Section 9.3.4). Perhaps one purpose of this tablet was to illustrate Kiir -Aur 's ability to copy precisely. However, Kiir -Aur 's 49 See also Gabbay and Jim\u00e9nez 2019: 60-61 and note 32, 63 texts with notes on breaks Text Phase Purpose/Label Type of breaks Kiir-Aur BAM 99 mama bt Aur abat e-p\u00ed e-\u00fa BAM 129 e-p\u00ed e-\u00fa N4 no. 237 amall\u00fb May Belong to the mamau-phase BAM 99 was copied by an assistant with a purpose statement (Maul 2010: 214 note 85). The assistant may therefore be responsible for the epi-note, if we assume Kiir -Aur would himself fill out the blanks when preparing the ritual. BAM 99 could have functioned as both an exercise for the student copying the manuscript, and a text for practical implementation by Kiir -Aur . However, it is difficult to account for Kiir -Nab\u00fb's KAR 56, which was copied by himself with a purpose statement when he was mamau. As a mamau, Kiir -Nab\u00fb must have been able to fill out such breaks himself when copying the text. While Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru-phase tablet BAM 129 could support Clancier's hypothesis described above, the use of purpose statements in some manuscripts argues against such a general interpretation. Therefore, the purpose(s) of all these notations cannot be properly evaluated presently. Regardless whether a copyist wrote from writing -boards or clay tablets, it is likely they would occasionally encounter a break in the original. Considering the few N4 tablets with epi-notes , it is reasonable to assume that some copies contained unmarked restorations by the copyist. 7.5 A Discussion of the Dated Tablet KAR 267 In August (9th of the month Ullu) of 658 BCE, Kiir -Aur \"quickly extracted\" the single columned vertical tablet (uppu) KAR 267 that he \"copied and checked according to its original\".50 This text contains a ritual against a ghost and it is the only dated tablet by Kiir -Aur (Maul 2010a: 205 and note 52).51 Unfortunately, the manuscript was not supplied with a title, and it therefore remains unclear during which part of his career Kiir -Aur copied KAR 267. Unlike later NB and LB texts, the NA learned texts from especially N4 were rarely equipped with a date formula.52 Therefore, the addition of a date to KAR 267 is not only important to us, but may also have marked a special occasion for Kiir -Aur . In general, the ritual in KAR 267 intends to dispel a ghost or \"confusional states\" (a(y)yattu) from a man's body to note 52; Hunger 1968: 69, no. 199 ms B. T he limmu can be found in Millard 1994: 53, 120. 51 Edited in Scurlock 2006 as no. 119-120 and Scurlock 1988b. See according to Scurlock 2006: 257; see KAR 267 obv. 2. The ritual may have been associated with the final prayer in bt rimki (Scurlock 1988b: 203; L\u00e6ss\u00f8e 1955: 101), have 176 Chapter 7 translated the latter as a \"fit\" acting as a demon. Furthermore, a \"fit\" could produce symptoms such as flowing saliva, bending hands and feet, confused speech, fever and aching \"strings\" , and it is connected to the expression for epilepsy, Antaubba (ibid.: 7-8, 44; see also Avalos 2007). In accordance with the content, the month and date may relate to ghosts. However, a traditional ritual connected to ghosts occurring on the 9th of Ullu does not exist. An OB kispu ritual may have been performed on the 9th of Abu (Tsukimoto 1985: 48-49 with references), a MA ritual against a \"fit\" was per - formed on the 29th of the month Duzu (Stol 193-96), another NA reference states that ghosts should be supplied with offerings on the 29th of Abu (Tsukimoto 1985: 79; Farber 1977: 211-13, text III line 14), and in general a kispu ritual was performed in relation to the second New Year celebration in the month Tartu to an aspect of Itar and cleansing in Assyria,55 possibly through the second Ullus are known from the 7th century NA court, but not for the year 658 (Parpola 1983a: 45, 187, 381-82, 482). Noticeably, Kiir - on \"Marduk's N4 no. 163, states: \"I am Asallui, who was created by his own decree, am I (to be interpreted) as follows: he is called Anar (i.e., Aur) on account of (the month) Ullu\". 57 been performed in connection to the \"Substitute King Ritual\" (Parpola 1983a: XXVI), or have been related to the removal of a \"curse\" (Zilberg and Horowitz 2016: 182-83). 54 On the Tartu, 2013a: 57ff., 201ff.). actually opened with the (admittedly generic) line obv. 1-2: DI NA GIDIM x[(ca. 4 signs)], \"If a ghost afflicts a person, stays continu[ously] in (his) body [and cannot be dispelled], and he continually has confusional states (caused by) a ghost [...]\" (Scurlock 2006: 352, 357). Although these were not exactly the same ritu- als, they both included a prayer to ama (Ambos 2013a: 204-6; Scurlock 2006: 358), and they concern some of the same problems. Although impossible to investigate completely here, KAR 267 may have been used similarly. For the New Year celebration(s) in of (Cohen 1993: 323; Borger 1996: 103, 225; Assyrian Astrolabe B describes Ellu as \"the work of the Elamite note 159; Cohen 1993: 56 For Ullu's possible relationship to Enlil or Ninurta, as well as the work song allu or the word ulla \"the feeble\" , see Wee Texts that May Belong to the mamau-phase The tablet does not contain a purpose statement, and was likely not aimed at a particular performance. Tanret (2011) argued in connection with the OB chief lamenter Ur-Utu that certain tablets were kept for the sake of remembrance and for creating a family identity, even though they had lost value and purpose. In line with the idea that tablets could hold commemorative purposes, I sug - gest the date attached to KAR 267 was (also) intended to commemorate a spe - cial day for Kiir -Aur . The connection between Ullu and Aur may supports this, although this remains conjecture. The present chapter argues that Kiir - Aur 's titles were important for his texts that are supplied with names until some time around the mamau-phase. It is therefore plausible that KAR 267 was written during or after this phase. While it is unknown for what occasion the tablet was copied, we can entertain the idea that this text marked a special event for Kiir -Aur in relation to copying a ritual suitable for a variety of pri- vate and official cultic duties. This situation may resemble the NB school texts dedicated under special circumstances to the Nab\u00fb-a-ar\u00ea temple in Babylon (Cavigneaux 1999a: 385-86, 388-91) 7.6 Other Technical Literature: BAM 307 and ACh Supp. 2 24 Perhaps following the instructions laid out in the EM, the lexical list CT 37 pl. 25 from Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase represents an aspect of his train- ing towards becoming an \"expert\" (umm\u00e2nu), as suggested in Section 9.4.1. It is therefore expected that he would also copy commentaries during this training phase. However, the only commentary certainly belonging to Kiir - Aur is BAM 307 without a title and possibly ACh Supp. 2 24 with a broken colophon.58 The latter text was excavated in Nineveh (K. 3145, see below). The left side of BAM 307 is completely broken, but some lines provide alternative readings, suggesting that the composition had a commentary -like content.59 The focus was likely pharmacological, as the text lists plants and 58 Frahm (2011a: 144-45) suggests the text could have been written by Kiir -Nab\u00fb. 59 An example is rev. 25: : bnu-tamarisk\". The text may be a mythological commentary similar to Livingstone 1986: 176-79, which also mentions \"cedar resin : giERIN \u00cc.GI an-zi-i. see Gabbay 2016; Frahm 2011a.178 Chapter 7 stones.60 The relationship between pharmacopeia and commentaries are pos - sibly echoed in a LB text from Borsippa, which states: \"When you perform (a treatment of) plant, stone, and wood (for fumigation?), or the art of iptu for the sick man - one does (it) in accord with its explanatory comment(?)\".61 However, unlike other N4 commentaries, BAM 307 does not use the m particle (Gabbay Two aspects indicate that the tablet stems from at least Kiir - Aur 's mamau-phase, although the purpose of the text is uncertain. Firstly, as the only commentary -like text from Kiir -Aur , the text fills the space occu- pied by commentaries foreshadowed to exist as part of the umm\u00e2nu training via the EM (see Section 9.4). Secondly, the text was copied on behalf of Kiir - Aur whereupon he checked it ([\u00fa-]a-ir-ma ib-ri). Although Kiir -Aur likely had a younger pupil copy an exercise as amall\u00fb eru (see Section 3.7.3), such uses of junior assistants have been suggested in this chapter as gener - ally belonging to Kiir -Aur 's mamau- and mama bt Aur-phases . An unresolved question is why Kiir -Aur used someone to copy a tablet with esoteric content. Additionally, Kiir -Aur could have been the copyist of the commentary ACh Supp. 2 24. The colophon \"for the Kiir - Aur has previously been suggested as a possible candidate, supplying man- uscripts to the royal libraries (Maul 2010a: 205 and note 53; Villard 1998: 19). However, many NA individuals are attested with this name (cf. Baker 2000: 621ff.), and the content of the commentary concerns astrology, on which the N4 collection contains relatively few tablets (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 51; Frahm 2011a: 270 and note 1279). It therefore remains uncertain if the tablet was copied by Kiir -Aur and whether or not he studied astrology at all.63 60 Several lines refer to illness and cure, rev. 7: [...] KUR dUTU-i ana IGIII.GIG .ME SIG, \"[...] the rising of the sun is good for (damqu) ill eyes\" (see CAD N/1: 267); [for] 61 Rochberg 2015: 229 and note Livingstone 255-56, BM noted by Rochberg, Livingstone took tu as a singular of \u00e2tu \"explanatory word list(s)\" , which is always in plural. Rochberg (2015: 229 note 89) refers to a similar statement in another LB text. See also Hee\u00dfel 9.2.3. See also Frahm 2004: 47 note 18. 63 The text ends with two peculiar lines on the bottom of rev. that May Belong to the mamau-phase 7.7 Summary This chapter has provided an overview of Kiir -Aur 's colophons without titles or possibly broken titles. Within these groups, internal features within the texts and colophons are useful for roughly allocating the tablets to various phases of Kiir -Aur 's career. Kiir -Aur was probably more inclined towards writing comprehensive colophons earlier in his career, at which time he may have provided his title in a majority of colophons. Alternatively, as suggested in Section 5.4, the apprentice Kiir -Aur would have provided the devout a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase. An important feature is Kiir -Aur 's use of the so -called \"purpose state - ments\" , which were used to designate the texts as part of a specific ritual or healing ceremony. These statements do not occur in colophons with titles before Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase, and colophons with purpose state - ments, but without titles, must largely be assigned to Kiir -Aur 's mamau- and mama bt Aur-phase. Kiir -Aur was likely in a position to head rituals during these phases, and the possible accumulation of tablets with purpose statements during these phases would support this hypothesis. Kiir -Aur 's simultaneous use of assistants to copy tablets on his behalf for specific perfor - mances underlines this suggestion. The present chapter also discussed Kiir -Aur 's sole dated tablet with- out a title, KAR 267, and suggested it may have been copied in connection to an important event in Kiir -Aur 's career, possibly around his mamau or mama bt Aur-phases . If KAR 267 truly belonged to either of these phases, it would imply that Kiir -Aur functioned as mamau or mama bt Aur in 658 BCE. However, this remains hypothetical. Finally, two examples of tech- nical literature in the form of commentaries were discussed in relation to content.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 009 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Chapter 8 Kiir-Aur's mama bt Aur-phase This chapter investigates the texts written by Kiir -Aur during his mama bt Aur-phase, during which he copied the majority of surviving texts that have titles in the colophons (24+). Three groups of tablets are distinguished among these manuscripts. The first and second groups comprise medical and ritual texts respectively, of which a substantial portion are designated as extracts (nisu, see below). Furthermore, a third group of texts possibly relates to Kiir -Aur 's affiliation with the Aur temple, as witnessed by his title. What follows provides an overview of the text groups copied by Kiir -Aur during his mama bt Aur-phase, a discussion of his title mama bt Aur, and a description of the individual texts in each group. Specific features are also investigated. Kiir -Aur copied and possibly formulated several prescriptions labelled as \"tested prescriptions\" (bulu latku) during this period. These are analysed in relation to the predominantly medical texts, together with at least one possible panacea, i.e., a universal drug. The present chapter also discusses Kiir -Aur 's duties in connection to the Aur temple. The career phase \"exorcist of the Aur temple\" (mama bt Aur) is the last identifiable phase to which Kiir -Aur , his brother ama -ibni and their father Nab\u00fb-bssunu progressed. The title mama bt Aur could therefore mark the pinnacle of Kiir -Aur 's career (see Maul 2010a: 206-208, 210-11). All of the texts in Table 15, except for PKTA pl. 39-40, are explicitly stated as deriv - ing from his mama bt Aur phase. The number of Kiir -Aur 's texts with colophons, especially medical and ritual texts, increases markedly during his mamau-phase and even more so in his mama bt Aur-phase. The texts written by Kiir -Aur as mama bt Aur attest to a variety of subjects, including: prescriptions against illnesses, a number of more broadly defined rituals against ghosts, witchcraft and evils, three namburbi-rituals , and a group of texts associated with the Aur temple. Of Kiir -Aur 's eight medical healing texts that he copied as mama bt Aur, at least six were copied with a purpose statement that emphasizes their practical dimension.1 It is worth noting that several of his medical texts from this phase concern internal illnesses (see Section 9.1). Among the ritu- als designed to remove malevolent causes of illness, three were also supplied 1 BAM 99, BAM 164, BAM 177, BAM 186, BAM 188, BAM 300. 181 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase Table 15 Texts assigned to Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phasea Group Text Content Format and designation Medical texts BAM 99 Obverse and 36, 38, 39, rev. 40-41, 42-51), and baths (rev. 42-51), an enema (rev. well as a bandage (rev. 42-51)Portrait; N/A BAM 164 Obverse and reverse: prescriptions Enema rinse good azu- and amurriqnu-jaundice, administered against (obv. 1-13), 145).

Furthermore, two of Kiir -Aur 's tablets from this phase were numbered as \"7th extract\" (BAM 99) and \"final extract\" (KAR 63), indicating that Kiir - Aur organized certain extracts during this phase (see Section 9.2.3). BAM 99 was written by someone else on the request of Kiir -Aur (\u00fa-a-ir-ma) and supplied with a purpose statement, which suggests that apprentices could have copied some of Kiir -Aur 's extracts with purpose statements with- out explicitly stating so. At least one text (KAV 42) was described as \"written by Kiir -Aur \" (\u00e0-\u00edr pKiir-A-ur) and contains evidence of editing (see Section 8.6). 8.1 The Title mama bt Aur The title \"exorcist of the Aur temple\" (mama bt Aur) ran in the Bba- uma-ibni family as well as other families attested in the N4 collection (Fadhil 2012: 38). Bba- uma-ibni, his Abu- erba, and Abu- erba 's son of unknown name, all claimed the title at some point.4 Whether the title was hereditary, served a practical or honorary purpose, or if individuals claimed the title in relation to specific duties or during particular periods is largely unknown.5 Furthermore, it is uncertain if individuals claiming this title were counted among the regular temple staff, although they may have been 2 KAR 38, KAR 374, LKA 157. 3 KAR 63 does not have a purpose statement, but is designated as a \"final largely broken. 4 See Section 2.3.3. The reconstruction by Baker (2017: 18) in LKA 141 of Kiir -Aur 's title as amall\u00fb mamau eru \u00e1 [\u00c9 A-ur] is disregarded here (see the LB colophons investigated by Ossendrijver (2011: 643), titles for copyists frequently represented a mix of traditional clan or qualification titles, but not necessarily temple offices. Villard (2007: 328-29 and note 77) suggested that the title zabardabb\u00fb may have designated a treasurer (cf. Lafont 1987: 51-52 with comparative third and second millennium BCE mate - rial). This prompted Villard (2007: 329) to suggest that exorcists could have served as trea- surers before the reign of Esarhaddon. However, this remains uncertain, and Villard (ibid.) points out that we know nothing about this for Kiir -Aur . If Nab\u00fb-bssunu is actually the individual mentioned in SAA 13 no. 39, he would have been involved in affairs of the temple administration (ibid.: 328-29). See also May 2018: 66-67.187 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase involved in the performance of various cultic rituals.6 Contemporary evidence suggests that numerous people within Assur were associated with the Aur temple during the 7th century BCE (Radner 2017b: 225). Thus, as implied by the title, there is a close association with the Aur temple, even though the exact nature of it still eludes us. Different designations for the Aur temple complex and its various parts were used during the NA period (George 1992: 172, 177, 183, 185-191; van Driel 1969: 34ff.). The two most common names, likely referring to the whole temple complex were \u00c9 dAur and \u00c9.\u00c1R .RA.7 Kiir -Aur and others claimed asso - ciation with the former in their titles, whereas the latter is attested in Bba- uma-ibni's title zabardabbi Earra (Maul 2010a: 200 note 40, 203). Prebends or leftovers from divine meals may have supported the Bba- uma-ibni family, but the evidence is tenuous (cf. Frame and Waerzeggers 2011: 129; Generally, it has been suggested that exorcists in the first millennium BCE acted as \"temple enterers\" (rib bti), a priestly title indicating access to the inner temple and association with the temple staff (Frame and Waerzeggers 2011: 132; Geller 2010: 50; Jean 2006: 139). However, it is unknown if this applied to Kiir -Aur and his family,9 and it is unclear to what extent the N4 fam- ily exorcists were allowed into the sanctuary of Aur.10 Evidence for some 6 Maul 2010: 8 Although the context is uncertain, Jean (2006: 141 and note 552) refers to Urad- Gula 's \"The Forlorn Scholar\" letter, in which he states that he received \"leftovers\" (rtu) (SAA 10 no. 294 obv. 17; see CAD R: 340). 9 7 concerning NA br\u00fbs at court). The exorcist appearing in a dream before the suf- ferer ubi-mer\u00ea and Lenzi 2010: 39). See also SAA 10 no. 96 rev. 1ff. and no. 97 obv. 5'ff. for cultic shaving. 10 The N4 home was connected to individuals in high positions in various temples (Fadhil 2012: 39-42; Maul 2010a: 212, 216-17). NA exorcists are, however, rarely attested directly in relation to the performance of rituals in temples, see, e.g., SAA 13 no. 71. They were part of the renovation or production of cultic statues in the temple workshop (bt mummi) (Walker and Dick 2001: 8ff., 15-16, 52 note 34). For a discussion of NA exorcists connected to temples, see Koch unpublished: that the entire \"Inner City\" (libbi li), another name for the city Assur, was presented in rituals as \"a single cultic place\". As such, the city itself may have functioned as a macro -temple complex, meaning that a resident may have had some access to temples. Esarhaddon indicates \"his people\" had access to the outer courtyard of the Aur temple (Pongratz-Leisten 2017: LV ).188 Chapter 8 measure of access to the Aur temple is perhaps implied when water from the cistern (brtu) of a Marduk temple is prescribed in two ritual instructions in BAM 28, which was probably copied by Kiir -Aur as mama bt Aur.11 This water may have been associated with the aps\u00fb via an incantation in the text to be recited in connection to using the water.12 The connection to the aps\u00fb in the Aur temple could have been established through an aps\u00fb water tank, which Sennacherib installed in the inner courtyard.13 Although BAM 28 speci- fies water from the Marduk temple cistern, Kiir -Aur may have been able to draw aps\u00fb- water from, e.g., the Aur temple as a substitute. As such, he may have had access to at least some inner temple courtyards. 8.2 Medical Texts from Kiir-Aur's mama bt Aur-phase Kiir -Aur did not copy out prescriptions between amall\u00fb eru- and mamau eru-phases . Although a number of medical texts were copied without a title that may belong to his mamau- or mama bt Aur-phases , the prescriptions copied during his mama bt Aur-phase represent the principal group of medical texts that can certainly be attributed to any of his educational and career phases. What follows provides a brief discussion of the content of the relevant texts. BAM 28 contains one initial diagnosis separated by lines for kadabbed\u00fb or bunu and afterwards at least five ritual instructions and five incantations.14 Because the text contains a diagnosis, I have included it in this section. Prescriptions related to kadabbed\u00fb were already copied by Kiir -Aur as amall\u00fb eru (see Section 3.1), but BAM 28 is the first of Kiir -Aur 's texts with colophons to mention the bunu-illness . This illness is described by Scurlock 11 was also employed in several namburbi-rituals (Maul 1994: 41 and note 45). For the word brtu, see Dalley 2013: 65.

The inscription on Sennacherib's aps\u00fb water tank also mentions the word P\u00da/brtu \"well\" (Gries 2017: 87 with references). The tank was damaged and the pieces were excavated mainly in a cistern in the so -called \"Ostanbau\" , see Gries 2017: pl. 7. 14 One additional fragment of this tablet was published in Beckman and Foster 1988 no. 7, which adds the previously missing title to the colophon. Furthermore, a piece of the tablet was collated in Durand 1982 pl. 120. The text has only been partially edited.

Notably, temples are rarely mentioned in medical texts, and the only other example among Kiir -Aur 's texts is BAM 78 without a title. This text describes how a patient with specific internal pains of the tulmu should \"visit Marduk's sanctuary (eertu) and he will recover\".17 Originally, K\u00f6cher XVI) and later Beckman and Foster (1988: 1-3) sug - gested that the text was copied by Kiir -Nab\u00fb, based on the fragmented signs in the theophoric element of the copyist's name.

May 2018: 65, 71; Ch. 8 note 18). However, it cannot be excluded that the name should be reconstructed as Kiir -Nab\u00fb. The text was designated as \"quickly extracted\". BAM 99 contains several diagnoses and prescriptions concerning internal maladies of the gastro -intestinal system, as well as various illnesses of the anus 15 Scurlock 2014: 289-90; cf. Farber 1990b: 315 and note 59. The name bunu likely refers to the verb ba u \"to stink\" , possibly referring to a symptom of the illness (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 157, 166). The illness is regularly identified as \"diphtheria\" by modern researchers, although this remains uncertain (Scurlock 2014: 390; Scurlock .KUD Z\u00da .KUD [(ca. four signs .KIN-ma see a translation a duplicate passage from BAM 77 in Stol 2006: 113. 18 In K\u00f6cher's copy, the name could be read *p*Ki-ir -dA[G(ligature)? ].

Furthermore, the l\u00fa of the title looks like a Babylonian form on Beckman and Foster's copy.190 Chapter 8 and ritual instructions for producing enemas and suppositories, for drink - ing potions, and for bathing the patient.19 BAM 99 is listed as a \"7th extract\" , includes a purpose statement, and states that it was copied hurriedly on behalf of Kiir -Aur (\u00fa-a-ir-ma), as discussed in Section 7.4.2. BAM 164 contains several prescriptions for potions concerning a variety of maladies, which are specified as being against swelling (diku), the kidney(s) (\u00c9LLAG), the spleen (\u00c0 .GI), discharge (mu), continually \"rising\" due to urine,20 and \"Anus illness\" (D\u00daR.GIG).21 After the majority of prescriptions, the text specifies the number of plants to be used and in one example that the ingredients are \"tested\" (latkti). After these notations, the patient is instructed to drink the concoction in water, beer or wine. Kiir -Aur copies several \"tested\" prescriptions during his mama bt Aur-phase, and these are discussed in Section 8.3. The colophon designates the text as \"hurriedly extracted\" and supplies it with a purpose statement. BAM 177 is a brief text containing two prescriptions, of which the latter is against \" sun-heat\" (tu).22 The first prescription may have been designated as \"tested\" , although the final signs of the sentence are broken (lat-ku x[x], see below). The latter prescription is the only one to specify an application method, namely a \"poultice\" (LAL-ti). The colophon contains a purpose state - ment and states that the text was \"hurriedly extracted\". 19 The text is edited in Geller 2005: 212ff. no. 35. See also Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 786 with internal references. Identified illnesses repeatedly [sic]\" (see Geller Andersen consider this to be an example of priapism: \"If a person continually has an erection when he tries to urinate ...\". The other comparable examples have K\u00c0.ME over G\u00cc.ME. This is perhaps a mistake in BAM 164 that could have occurred due to the purpose statement. 21 The text is partially edited in Geller (2005: 80-83, 124-25 ms ZZ) and Scurlock and Andersen (2005: 787 with internal references). 22 The first prescription states obv. 7: PAB 18 a-pi-is-lat lat-ku [...]\". The writing a-pi-is-lat may be related to apial\u00fb, which may refer to a defor - mity, perhaps regarded as an illness from the A/2: 170; CDA : to the meagre number of references, Scurlock (2014: 462 note 51) disregards this reading and suggests a reading a-pi-i-at related to apit\u00fb \"por - tion, agreed proportion\" (CAD 197). The interpretation remains uncertain. The read- ing \"Sun-heat\" tu in the second prescription is that of Scurlock 2014: 462 note 51; cf. Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 788 with internal reference. However, it is also possible to interpret the signs e-ti as Z\u00cd-ti \"bile\" (martu). 191 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase BAM 186 contains three prescriptions for oils to be administered as enemas.23 The first is a lavage for the anus and the prescription is designated as \"good and tested\" against azu- or amurriqanu-jaundice (see Section 9.1). After the prescription follows a single line in obverse line 13, before and after which is a horizontal ruling line, stating: \"rinse of oils (against) ' sun-heat'\". 24 Two pre - scriptions follow, of which the first is fragmentary and the second is for an enema. The function of obverse line 13 as a subscript to the first prescription or a heading for the second (and third?) prescription remains uncertain (see Section 8.3.2). The colophon contains a purpose statement and specifies that the text was \"quickly extracted\". The obverse of BAM 188 is completely broken, but the reverse contains a diagnosis and a prescription for a single enema used for a man ill from bile, aazu- or amurriqanu-jaundice.25 The text is a partial duplicate of the first prescription in BAM 186 (see Section 8.3.2 below). The two types of jaundice encountered in BAM 186 and BAM 188 above, azu, the \"catcher -demon \", and amurriqnu, \"making yellow(?)\" ,26 are the two common types of jaundice attested in Mesopotamian sources.27 Among Kiir -Aur 's texts with colophons it is notable that jaundice is treated only in these two texts. Although this may be a coincidence, these illnesses are not featured in Kiir -Aur 's earlier texts. The colophon of BAM 188 contains a purpose statement and the text is \"quickly extracted\". Only a small portion of the reverse remains of BAM 300, but this is sufficient to conclude that it once contained at least one prescription involving fumiga- tion and considered suitable for any malady. The text is treated and discussed in Section 8.4. The colophon contains a purpose statement and the text is des - ignated as an uiltu that was \"quickly extracted\". 23 The text is partially edited in Scurlock and Andersen (2005: 788 with internal reference). See also Steinert 2015: 117 note 50, 125. \u00cc.ME i-mi UD .DA . 25 The text is partially edited in Scurlock and Andersen (2005: 788 with internal reference). 26 For azu from azu \"to seize, hold\" , 74, 123-25, 148-51, 179, 183 Andersen 2005: 32-34, 138- 39, 191-92. 27 It seems that azu was considered to be more severe than amurriqnu, although both cases could be lethal (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 125 and notes 105-106; see also CAD A/1: 186). Though one would expect a connection between jaundice and the liver and gallbladder (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 138, 191), only azu was really connected to the liver as well as Ninurta (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 74; Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 32-34, 138, 476, 520). Waste of flesh was thought to be connected to amurriqnu (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 138-39).192 Chapter 8 BAM 303 contains at least five prescriptions, of which one is largely broken (the beginning of the obverse).28 The remaining four prescriptions are described as \"(sets of) ingredient(s)\" (matu) used \"for softening up\" (lubbuku).29 The last prescription is longer and designated as a \"(set of) ingredient(s) for lubri- cating [feet] that are inflated with wind and (are) stiff\".30 The manuscript is specified in the colophon as consisting of \"tested prescription(s) from the hands of the scholar\".31 The text is without known duplicates (K\u00f6cher 1964: XXII) and is unique. As discussed in the overview above, six of Kiir -Aur 's eight medical texts from his mama bt Aur-phase contain purpose statements attesting to the practical application of this knowledge (BAM 99, BAM 164, BAM 177, BAM 186, BAM 188, BAM 300). These are extracted (nasu) and at least one is a num- bered extract (nisu, BAM 99). Additionally, several of the texts from this phase contain \"tested prescriptions\" , which is a feature rarely previously observed 164, BAM 177, BAM 186, BAM 303). Kiir -Aur 's texts contain treatments against previously unencountered illnesses, which appear to involve broadly applicable prescriptions (BAM 300). Notably, Kiir -Aur copied a text that was \"from the hands of the scholar\" (BAM 303). 8.3 Tested Prescriptions among the Medical Texts Four of Kiir -Aur 's medical texts from his mama bt Aur-phase (BAM 164, BAM 177, BAM 186, BAM 303), as as a single mamau eru-phase manuscript (N4 A 2727), contain statements that individual prescriptions were \"tested\" (latku, Steinert 2015: 125, 128). Furthermore, three of these examples (BAM 164, 177, 186) are specified as excerpted tablets with purpose statements (ibid.: 123). This section investigates these examples to illustrate Kiir -Aur 's 28 The text is partially edited in Steinert (2015: 127-28) and Scurlock and Andersen (2005: Andersen 2005: 170). The IM id-[p]i-t[u] is peculiar. The related word idiptu is translated in CAD (I-J : 9) as \"wind\" that functions like an illness or demon, and derives from edpu \"inflated\" (CDA : 124). CAD (/1: 72) described the last prescription as \"Herstellung von on the basis of rev. 19'-20': \u00da.I.A an-nu-t[i] 20' ana IGI ta-za-ru. However, it remains unclear if \"you scatter these plants\" into something or if ana IGI refers to scattering the ingredients in front of the patient, possibly written without the third person singular pronominal suffix. 31 Rev. 24': use of such \"tested\" knowledge during his mama bt Aur phase by discuss - ing the meaning behind the term \"tested\" (latku) and providing an example that could indicate that Kiir -Aur himself was involved in testing during his phase. In general, the Bba- uma-ibni family seems to have used authorized and \"tested\" knowledge in their practice..32 Steinert suggests that such phrases indicated a tendency among healers such as Kiir -Aur to use \"tested\" rem- edies because they either had greater confidence in them or wanted to confirm the efficacy of a remedy (Steinert 2015: 123, 139 and note 121). Kiir -Aur 's five examples are shown in Table 16. All tablets, except N4 A 2727, were written when Kiir -Aur was mama bt Aur and is assumed to have been in a position to \"test\" prescriptions 32 Several examples of \"tested\" treatments occur in, e.g., the internal illness compendium BAM 95 copied by Nab\u00fb-bssunu (Geller 2005: 168 obv. 78-81). The N4 manuscript BAM 42, from Aur - kin- umi contains several prescriptions designated as \"a secret of kingship\" (BAM 42 obv. 12, obv. 35). For such N4, see Maul 2010a: 198.Table 16 Kiir -Aur 's ina GETIN NAG .ME \"Nine tried drugs for discharge, he keeps drinking (them) in wine\" BAM UD \"This \"tested\" rinse is good for azu and amurriqnu.

In comparison, the only \"tested\" text besides N4 A 2727 predating Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase is KAR 230, which was described as a \"tested ritual procedure\" (ne-pi-am lat-ku). However, it is cer - tain that this phrase does not refer to a test performed by Kiir -Aur (Section 8.3.2). The tested prescriptions in BAM 164, BAM 177, and BAM 186 are found in the N4 collection in duplicate prescriptions that are also labelled \"tested\" , and in some instances in duplicate prescriptions listed as non-tested.33 The last tab - let, BAM 303, was a uppu specified as: \"tested prescription(s) hands of the scholar\" (Steinert 2015: 123, 127-28).34 Accordingly, all prescriptions on this tablet may have been considered \"tested\" (ibid.: 127-28).35 Phrases referring to \"scholars\" have been interpreted as an indication that the knowledge was regarded as \"handed down from an anonymous scholarly source\" (ibid.: 123). The prescriptions in BAM 303 are without known duplicates. 8.3.1 Meaning of the Phrase \"Tested Prescription\" The term latku \"tested\" was generally used to prescrip - a therefore implies \"that knowledge of effective drugs and remedies had been acquired through practical experience\" (ibid.: 104). The phrase was probably used to indicate that prescriptions regularly produced the desired results and evidence for testing by specialists can be found in the contemporary NA royal 33 BAM 164 is duplicated by the N4 manuscripts BAM 116 (broken colophon) and the eight - columned BAM 161, as well as the four -columned Nineveh manuscript BAM 431; 137-38 with score transliteration). BAM 177 is partly duplicated in the N4 manuscript BAM 124 col. iii 38-40, which is not labelled as \"tested\". BAM 186 is duplicated in the N4 manuscripts BAM 188 rev. 1-10 and BAM 189 col. iv 1-16, neither of which are labelled as \"tested\" (see below). BAM 303 is without known duplicates. 34 It remains uncertain if Kiir -Aur is the umm\u00e2nu mentioned testing the prescriptions (see Geller 2010: 193 note 178). BAM 303 is also one of only three instances in which the theophoric element of Kiir -Aur 's name is written dA-ur rather than A-ur. The other two examples are Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts N4 no. 237 and N4 no. 289. 35 The two prescriptions that are not explicitly labelled as \"tested\" contain 36 Steinert 2015; Geller 2010: 17-18. Another type of efficacy phrase used is ana X damiq - \"(a drug) is good for X\" , perhaps meaning \"effective\" (Steinert 2015: 116-18), which was also used in the NA royal correspondence by healers (ibid.: 117 and note 51). The term could be used as well to qualify, e.g., rituals against various non-medical things (ibid.: 118 and note 53-54). For the use of latku in relation to witchcraft, see Schwemer 2007a: mama bt Aur-phase 139).37 However, minor variation occurs between manu- scripts of the same \"tested\" remedies (ibid.: 138), and in some cases the same prescription that was considered as \"tested\" can also occur without this phrase (ibid.: 135 note 104). Steinert has recently argued that the latku-phrases \"had a communicative function\" in that they improved \"the user -friendliness of the text\" , although they rarely occur in a standardized way (Steinert 2015: 115-16). Little is known about the historical development of the \"tested remedies\" and it is difficult to determine when and by whom efficacy phrases were added (ibid.: 120-21). This is partly because Mesopotamian healers never added indications if they or others confirmed a remedy (ibid.: 121). Note that Adad- umu-uur , the famous chief exorcist of Esarhaddon, tested at least one treatment on slaves before it was administered to the royal family (Geller 2010: 88). Sadly, we do not know the prescription. However, the combination of the low frequency of attesta- tions and that \"tested\" remedies occur on tablets with purpose statements may indicate that the \"tested\" remedies had special status for the healers (Steinert 2015: 123; Geller 2010: 17-18). 8.3.2 An as Investigator of Efficacy? The \"tested\" prescription in BAM 186 from Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur- phase is mostly duplicated by a similar prescription in his mama bt Aur manuscript, BAM 188, which was not deemed tested.38 Furthermore, a non-tested prescription in the slim, multi- columned text BAM 189 from N4 also duplicates the prescription in BAM 188 and possibly the tested prescription in BAM 186.39 BAM 189 does not contain a colophon and the copyist is unfortu- nately unknown. The situation in these three prescriptions therefore differs from the known duplicates of the \"tested prescription\" in BAM 164, all of which were labelled as \"tested\" (Steinert 2015: 137-38). The three prescriptions are transliterated here, followed by a translation of the relevant passages: A = BAM 188 (rev. 1-10); B = BAM 186 (obv. 1-13); C = BAM 189 (col. iv 1-16): 37 Steinert uses BAM 95 rev. 26 to argue that drugs provided regular results via the phrase bulu latku a ina qti kayam[nti \u00fb?], \"A (Steinert 2015: 139 121; Geller 2005: 133-34 no ms V ). However, see Ch. 6 notes 25-26 with references and further discussion of similar phrases. 38 Unfortunately, the obverse of BAM 188 is almost completely broken (K\u00f6cher 1963b: XXI). 39 BAM 189 = N4 no. 326. The format resembles the stone inventory list BAM 366, written by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb Appendix NA -di ana D\u00daR-[\u00fa DUB] 40 The line below also opens with the sign KAR. Furthermore, BAM 189 col. iv 10 seems to end with AB, and the opening KAR likely spells out kar -\u00fa. As a result, col. iv 9 must list another plant, but then the total of 14 plants in line 15 does not fit with the amount of plants. Perhaps the young student wrote kar u twice, maybe in both forms: kar au and karu.197 Kiir-Aur 's mama is ill , azu-jaundice, or amurriqnu-jaundice, of plant-based ingredients) ... 7b You weigh out these 14 plants equally (and) boil (them) in pre - mium beer.

(list of plant-based ingredients, from line 7 supplied individually with a measure of one) ... 15 Total: 14 (plants), an azu rinse. I propose that the three prescriptions transliterated and translated above represent the same prescription.41 This is based on the roughly similar list of ingredients and the partial overlap in illnesses treated by the prescriptions. The ingredients used in all three prescriptions are generally identical and pre - sented in the same order, with the exception of the addition of a single broken ingredient in B (obv. 5) and perhaps also C (col. iv 9). All three prescriptions are against azu-jaundice, which suggests a similar aim. However, B can be directed against both azu-jaundice and amurriqnu-jaundice, and A can be used against bile (martu), azu-jaundice, or amurriqnu-jaundice. Additionally, the illnesses are listed at different places in the texts. A opens with diagnoses, whereas B and C identify the illnesses at the end of the prescription. 41 Erica Couto -Ferreira (2018) has recently published a similar argument concerning these three texts, and she reached the same conclusion. My study was written independently of Couto Ferreira's, and I was not aware of her publication before my dissertation, on which this monograph is based, was submitted in August 2017.198 Chapter 8 Furthermore, B and C identify the prescription as a \"rinse\" (marau), and C also totals the number of ingredients. Notably, B specifies that it is a \"tested rinse\" considered \"good for azu- and amurriqnu-jaundice \" at the end of the prescription. Perhaps the measurements in B could indicate that specific- ity was required to be considered \"tested\" , although, e.g., the so -called \"tested eye salve of ammurabi\" is found in duplicates with and without measure - ments (Steinert 2015: 134). We shall return to this below. A number of other differences can also be observed. B contains individual weight measurements for each ingredient, C does not specify the measure - ments in the first half and adds the generic 1(a) as the weight measurement for each ingredient in the second half, and A instructs the reader to weigh out the ingredients equally. Additionally, A and B contain instructions for pre - paring the prescription after the lists of ingredients, which are omitted in C. The instructions also differ between A and B, with A containing more specific instructions than B. Nonetheless, the almost identical ingredient lists and shared use against azu-jaundice in all three instances suggest that these prescriptions can be regarded as the same. The differences could indicate that the prescriptions are from different recensions or the result of personal varia- tion. However, another hypothesis is possible. To reiterate, A and B are from Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase, whereas C is by an unknown copyist from N4. Furthermore, A and B are both from tablets with purpose statements, suggesting a practical application of the knowledge contained therein. The duplicate prescriptions in A and B could be applied against several related illnesses, although only B was labelled as \"tested\".42 Speculatively, B may have been labelled as \"tested\" by Kiir -Aur and the addition of weight measurements and an additional ingredient are the result of his test of the prescription.43 If so, Kiir -Aur perhaps verified the effect of the prescription in A against azu- and amurriqnu-jaundice, but maybe not against bile (cf. Geller 2010: 17-18). Following this line of reason- ing, Kiir -Aur would have copied A before B. T he final separating line in B makes such a difficult hypothesis slightly more probable, if it is interpreted as 42 For the relationship between \"bile\" and the various types of jaundice, see B\u00f6ck 2014a: 122-28 with further references. 43 Couto -Ferreira (2018: 158 and note 30) notes that BAM 186 rev. 23 contains the unusual phrase \"I have collected (18) oils\" , 18 \u00cc.ME a-bu-u. However, there are at least one sign following a-bu-u not treated by Couto -Ferreira. The sign appears to add [U(II?) referring to \"(in) [(my?)] hand\" , although a preposition U would have been preferable (see CAD /1: 6f.). The reading is therefore uncertain. This line could be a fur - ther indication that BAM 186 represents an experimental text.199 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase a subscript to the first prescription.44 After having specified that the \"tested\" prescription is considered good against azu and amurriqnu, the prescrip - tion states its true purpose, which is separated from what precedes it by a hori- zontal line: \"a rinse (Stol 2007a: 22ff., 37-38). Thus, the prescription was used in this particular case to treat imi ti, an illness not specified elsewhere as treatable by this particular rinse.45 Regardless of the interpretation, the appearance of this prescription in two mama bt Aur texts containing few prescriptions could indicate that the remedy was among Kiir -Aur 's preferred prescriptions. 8.4 Panaceas among the Medical Texts At least one of Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur texts (BAM 300) suggests that he may have employed certain panaceas, i.e., widely applicable treatments used to cure various maladies.46 It is likely that certain cures were preferred by indi- vidual healers (Steinert 2015: 123, 139; of ammurabi\" \"as a panacea for all eye ailments\" , i.e., a remedy for every problem affecting the eye. In relation to Kiir - Aur , it was hypothesized above that the first prescription in BAM 186 may have been a tested version of a prescription similar to the extract found in BAM 188. This prescription may therefore have been used on numerous occasions by Kiir -Aur against certain internal maladies. Similarly, Section 6.2 argued that KAR 230 was a multipurpose ritual, which could be used during most house calls. Additional texts may corroborate Kiir -Aur 's preference for a limited number of prescriptions certain maladies. BAM 300 was \"quickly extracted\" (a-an-i ZI-a) statement as an uiltu when Kiir -Aur was mama bt Aur. The text only contains a broken treatment for anointing and 44 However, it remains uncertain how to interpret this line. B contains three prescriptions. As the second and third prescription in B do not contain preserved passages specifying what illnesses against which they were directed, it is also possible that obv. 13 functioned as a header. The second prescription is designated in rev. 23 as: \"18 oils for relaxi[ng(?)]\" , 18 \u00cc.ME ina pu-u-u-[i?]. Note that puuu mostly occurs in prescriptions in relation to ana (CAD P: 231). The third prescription is broken at the relevant passage in rev. 28: \"Total: 8 plant[s 186 states that it is \"extracted\" (nasu), indicating that it was copied from a manuscript. How to understand this situation remains uncertain. 46 See Steinert 2015: 134-35; Geller 2010: 25, 104. For another panacea found in Nineveh and Sultantepe, see CMAwR 2: 435ff.200 Chapter 8 fumigating a patient, as well as a description of the prescription that is delin- eated by ruling lines and placed directly before the colophon: Rev. 1': [... traces of three signs ...] MUN Rev. 2': [... x] rag [... 3' ...] you continually anoint him in oil, you fumigate him with embers in a kal lu-bowl of a sku[ll] and he will get well. This is a 'universal' prescription good for all (illnesses). The sole prescription in BAM 300 could therefore be used against most mal- adies and was designated in its subscript as a panacea (K\u00f6cher 1964: XXII). Incidentally, while the EM lists few \"prescription\" types (bulus), and few of these are specific, one type mentioned in the second section is the generic \"prescription for all of every (illness)\" (EM rev. 35: bul-i kal gim-ri; cf. Steinert 2018c: 186). This is reminiscent of the description in BAM 300 and could indi- cate that this passage of the EM reflects some knowledge concerning specific types of medicine that was acquired by exorcists in practice. Kiir -Aur copied several tablets with few prescriptions as mama bt Aur and without titles, although only BAM 300 contains a subscript that labels the 47 The \"soiled rag\" , ulp lupputi, is used in a variety of ritual and medical contexts (CAD U-W: 71-72). 48 The kallu-bowl is described as made of clay or wood, although CAD (K: 83) also lists the word as part of descriptions of the \"crown (kal lu) of the human skull (qaqqadu )\" or \"shell (kal lu) of a turtle\" (see AHw: 426). The gulgullu is listed as a \"skull\" or a \"container a human skull\" (CAD G: 127-28; AHw: 297). In the majority of examples, a skull refers to human remains. In at least one example a patient is fumigated using a human skull, see AMT 98,1 obv./rev.? 9': ... ina gul-gul \"... you fumigate with embers in a human skull [...]\" (CAD G: 128). Presumably, BAM 300 describes a word gimru designates \"totality\" or \"everything\" , and in relation to epithets, e.g., bl gimri, it can kalma means it)\" or \"everything\" and is generally used indeclinable as object of verbs, in genitive constructions, and in apposition to a preceding to totality (AHw: S 53).201 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase prescription as \"universal\".51 Other tablets with few prescriptions were found in multiple copies in N4, attesting to their use in the collection.52 Furthermore, Kiir -Aur may have had a number of \"favourite\" prescriptions for a selection of maladies, such as the \"tested prescription\" in BAM 186.53 As a result, it is pos - sible that Kiir -Aur regularly used several of the prescriptions on tablets that bear only a few prescriptions. 8.4.1 Excursus: Kiir-Aur's Possible Multipurpose Medical Incantations Kiir -Aur 's medical tablets from his various phases contain relatively few incantations. In addition to groupings of incantations against kadabbed\u00fb and in BAM individual incantations healing occur in BAM 102 against \"Anus illness\" , perhaps in BAM myth (see K\u00f6cher 1971: XI),55 in N4 no. 24 for \"Child calming\" ,56 and in the unpublished N4 A 400.57 In general, Geller (2007b: 389-92) has suggested that medical incantations, i.e., incantations occurring in medical texts, serve ancillary func- tions, increasing the effectiveness of prescriptions or serving to induce positive psychological effects on the patient. Although Kiir -Aur 's medical tablets with incantations were copied for varying purposes, such as the possible pedagogical purpose behind the imgid- d\u00fbs BAM 102 and N4 no. 24, it is conceivable that Kiir -Aur 's few medical incantations - because of their low number - were broadly applicable against the maladies they treat (as with the prescription BAM 300 discussed above), or that they were rarely employed medically. The incantation against \"Anus illness\" in BAM 102 is unfortunately mostly broken and the ritual instruction 51 Single prescription tablets, e.g., BAM 177. 52 Multiple duplicated tablets, e.g., BAM 68 (Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb), N4 no. 18) and obv.? 1'-9' (breaks off) (= N4 no. 536). 53 Whether or not some form of anaesthetics was available to ancient healers remains uncertain, but it is noteworthy that BAM 260, copied by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb at an uncertain stage, may contain instructions for getting the patient drunk enough that he may pass out (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 361; Hee\u00dfel 2002b: 104-105; Geller and Cohen 1995: 1813 and note 26). If so, these prescriptions could have been part of the ad hoc prescriptions of these healers. 54 See also BAM 321. The left edge of the tablet is broken, but obv. 1-9 and rev. 27-31 seem to be magical recitations. 55 The incantation mentions Ea and possibly some healing plants related to the nether - world, see CAD /1: 318. 56 I consider N4 no. 24 here, although it could be argued that this incantation served a pro - phylactic purpose. However, a crying child may have heralded the presence of Lamatu, and therefore it indicated a negative situation related to illness (see Section 5.2.2). 57 Likely, the two unpublished incantations in N4 A 2727 also belong in this discussion.202 Chapter 8 is explicitly \"not written\" (Section 6.1). However, it is not impossible that the incantation was similar to other incantations against \"Anus illness\" from N4, such as those found on Kiir -Aur 's N4 A 2727 and the anonymously copied BAM 105 (N4 no. 239). The latter text contains two incantations (obv. 1-6, 8-11?) and a ritual (the incantation) over (any - pository, ointment (or) enema for 'Anus illness'\" (see Geller 2005: 231). The first incantation of BAM 105 could therefore be used as a \"Kultmittel- beschw\u00f6rung\" to activate or enhance the effect of almost any kind of remedy designed to cure \"Anus illness\" , and perhaps related illnesses.58 The first incan- tation in BAM 105 does therefore seem to be universally applicable against rec- tal problems. If we assume that a somewhat similar incantation was copied onto BAM 102, this incantation could have served a comparable purpose for Kiir -Aur .59 Noticably, the of BAM 105, and both recitations and accompany - ing instructions in the manuscript are said to be \"tested prescriptions, which are suitable for use(?)\" (see Section 5.3). Comparatively, there are only two similar medical incantations among the LB school texts published by Finkel (2000: 148), which address problems in the kidney and epigastrium, as well as a fever (nos. 50-51).60 In general, Geller (2007b: 391-92) found it problematic to explain why some medical texts include medical incantations whereas the majority of medical texts do not 58 It may have been possible to activate or enhance the effect of specific ingredients and cures with an incantation, perhaps pointing to a belief that drugs and cures could be used for evil effects as well, mirroring the Greek pharmakon, which refers to various healing drugs and poisons. For examples, see CAD /1: see Nutton 2004: 98, 328 note 6, 348 note 82. This duality may be another reason why the NA royal court used divination to determine if specific drug were to be applied (Koch 2015: 129 and note 340; SAA 10 no. 185 and no. 187). The question of the negative effects of medication should be investigated further. 59 See also Kiir -Aur 's fragmentary tablet KAL 10 no. 5 without a title containing treat - ments against mmtu, in which two single -line instructions can be found on the reverse after incantations 4': may be reminiscent of the example from BAM 105 quoted above. 60 Again, Gesche's school texts largely excluded medical material and Gesche (2001: 213-15) discussed such material in relation to the professional specialization process.203 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase (cf. Geller 2010: 91ff.). In connection to Kiir -Aur , it is therefore not surpris - ing that he copied relatively few medical incantations among his tablets with colophons. Whether the low number of medical incantations indicates that Kiir -Aur regularly used only a limited number of them, or that he simply used them infrequently remains unresolved. 8.5 Ritual Texts from Kiir-Aur' s mama bt Aur-phase The second group of Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur texts comprise ritual texts with incantations, prayers and ritual instructions. What follows presents a brief discussion of the content of each relevant text in order to provide an overview of this group. BAM 321 likely opens on the obverse with a prayer (obv. 1-9) and moves into a ritual instruction alongside another incantation (obv. 10-23).61 Afterwards, the obverse contains an additional ritual instruction (obv. 24-26) and another prayer (obv. 27-31). The reverse, most of which is fragmentary, contains a large ritual instruction referencing another incantation (rev. 32-51). The ini- tial prayer pretitions a man's god and goddess to be favourable towards the supplicant,62 the second mentions Enlil, Enki and Asallui,63 and the third prayer is directed towards Nab\u00fb and Tamtu.64 The colophon is broken and only Bba- uma-ibni's name remains. However, two broken names before Bba- uma-ibni's name end with the preserved titles mama bt Aur, sug - gesting that the names should be reconstructed as Kiir -Aur and Nab\u00fb- bssunu. Notably, the text is a duplicate of the first part of BAM 322, which is designated as \"a copy from the palace of ammurabi\".65 BAM 322 was copied by a high priest of the Aur temple and for reasons unknown placed in the N4 collection (Steinert 2015: 129). If Kiir -Aur 's BAM 321 represents a copy of the 61 The text remains unedited (see B\u00f6ck 2014a: 78-79 note 8). 62 Obv. 1. 63 Obv. 19-20, obv. 23. 64 Obv. 27. 65 Part of the text is duplicated by the peculiar manuscript BAM and note 78). Interestingly, BAM 322 contains a dividing line after obv. 28, amm[ur]abi, king of the world\". The latter half is later designated in of the world\". Robson (2019: 133) has recently expressed doubt about the claim regarding the text's provenance.204 Chapter 8 relevant section of BAM 322, it could signify that he purposely copied ancient knowledge thought to be derived from ammurabi's palace. The text copied by Beckman and Foster (1988: 4) as no. 21 contains an unknown incantation ritual and it remains unedited. The colophon is frag - mentary, and nothing further can be added here. KAR 62 contains an incantation and a ritual that is stated in the incipit to be \"If an angry man is to be reconciled (with 1986: 54, N4 no. 104; Ebeling ritual instruction prescribes making an \"ox\" (alpu) of clay, which is possibly buried by the river.67 However, the sign for \"ox\" (GU) can also be read \"ghost\" (eemmu), and the eemmu was described in the underworld vision of an Assyrian prince as having the head of an ox, but the hands and feet of a human (Ambos 2013a: 60 note 177; Livingstone 1989: 72 line 6). As a result, it is possible that the text was con- nected to ghosts.68 The text was labelled as an uiltu of Kiir -Aur . KAR 63 consists of several incantations and ritual instructions concerned with soothing an angry or furious man (Peders\u00e9n 1986: 54, N4 no. 101; Ebeling a \"hurriedly extracted\" uiltu of Kiir - Aur and designated as a \"final extract\" (see Section 9.2.3). Interestingly, all entries are duplicated with only minimal variation by KAR 43, which was des - ignated as: \"written and checked [ac]cording to the wording of an imgidd\u00fb- tablet, an 'Akkadian' copy\".70 Notably, KAR 43 contains the note \"new break\" (e-p\u00ed e-\u00fa) in rev. 17, but this line is copied with (reconstructed?) text in KAR 63 rev. 15. The question is if these tablets were copied from the same original, and if they were contemporary copies. This remains uncertain. KAR 80, edited and republished as KAL 2 no. 8, concerns a ritual with prayers for a man with various symptoms who is suffering because of witchcraft (kipu) 66 Rev. 1: KA.INIM.MA DI zi-na-a ana SILIM!-me. The verb zen\u00fb \"to be angry\" is well attested in connection to men and gods (CAD Z: 85-86). The tablet is edited in Ebeling 1931b: 67 Rev. 2: D\u00d9.D\u00d9 .BI ... (see CAD T: 336). 68 For a ghost as an ox, see George 1991: 148-49, 157 line 18. 69 See also Scurlock 1997: 82 and note 32; Ebeling 1915: 92-95, edition duplicate KA.INIM.MA DI NA they cry out in anger to a man\". 70 KAR 43 (= N4 no. for MUR\u00daB as p\u00fb). Variations occur in individual signs, e.g., KAR 43 obv. 12 ending -tu/ KAR 63 obv. 12 ending -tu, as well as line divisions, e.g., KAR 43 obv. 13ff./KAR 63 obv. 13ff. with varying line by his \"adversary\" (bl dabbi). The last incantation is designated as \"uburrud\u00fb (to undo witchcraft), for burning figurines\".71 KAR 374 consists of an incantation possibly addressed to Venus on the obverse and a ritual instruction for producing figurines on the reverse, both of which were possibly connected to (divine) anger (rbu).72 The text was \"hur - riedly extracted\" with a purpose statement. LKA 70(+KAR 57) consists of the second tablet in the Nineveh recension of the incantation ritual npe Duzi-Itar \"the (ritual) procedure(s) of Dumuzi (and) Itar\".73 These ritual actions were formally directed towards ghosts (eemmu), the sagulaza- demon, and mimma lemnu \"Any evil\" refers to \"fit\" and mimma lemnu, as well as various demons.75 Farber (1977: 24-26), however, noted differences between the Nineveh and Assur recensions concerning how the tablets are ordered, and while LKA 70+ should formally be the second tablet, a tablet before is not known in Assur. The ritual was probably performed around the end of the month Tammuz (June - July) (ibid.: 122-23).76 71 that man with witchcraft, ev[il] schemes [have been pl]otted against him ...\" (CMAwR 1: 301). Furthermore, Nab\u00fb-bssunu is sup - plied with the title l\u00faME.ME \u00c9 AN .[AR ] in the colophon. ME.ME can be read ipu, although it is unusual in the N4 colophons. The writing may be an intentional reference to the writing dME.ME for the healing goddess Gula. 72 Unedited, see Reiner 1995: 23 note 85; Maul 1994: 75 note \"(in term rbu/rubbu for \"anger, wrath\" is not well attested, although at least two SB examples address Itar, which mir - rors the incantation that here possibly addresses Venus (CAD R: 400; AHw: 992). The pro - duction of figurines are mentioned in KAR 374 rev. 5: 2 NU IM D\u00d9, \"you make 2 clay figurine(s)\". For anger and fury in connection to the god Erra, see Machinist 1983: 224. 73 Farber 1977: 127ff. ms b and pl. 14; Scurlock 1988a no. 86; see also Wiggermann 2010. Concerning such rituals and their setting, see Leick 2003: 225-26. 74 Farber 1977: 140-41. The rituals play on the well-known relationship between the nether - world and Dumuzi as well as Itar, as known from Itar's Descent (Lapinkivi 2010). By extension, the Itar -Dumuzi cult was related to Dumuzi's relationship to the harvest and a ritual was performed for the dead Dumuzi during the month Tammuz, i.e., in the summer when the harvest was done (Cohen 1993: 477, 479-481). 75 Farber 1977: 7.5. Noticeably, Farber's \"Hauptritual B\" was against various acts of sorcery and took place in a man's house (Farber 1977: 218-60; Wiggermann 2010: Soden 1936: 259. Additionally, Farber (1977: 124) argues for this ritual being part of the heading found in the EM obv. 5, see Geller 2000: 244, 252 note 5; Jean 2006: 64.206 Chapter 8 LKA 77 belongs to the series ulbazizi, meaning \"to eradicate evil\" , and the various rituals are directed towards removing the generic evil mimma lemnu \"any evil\".77 The incantations are bilingual and each of the three columns on each side of the tablet comprise two columns with Sumerian and Akkadian in each. The incantations were apparently widely applicable.78 The relation- ship between mimma lemnu and the patient's bed seems pivotal to several treatments of illnesses by Kiir -Aur 's family.79 The ulbazizi series is also mentioned in the EM as a work within iptu.80 The colophon of LKA 77 con- tains a curse and an instruction not to remove Kiir -Aur 's name. LKA 83 consists of two incantations and a brief recitation to ensure that the ghost, possibly of a recently deceased, went to the underworld and took various evils with it.81 The text is labelled as an uiltu of Kiir -Aur . It is note - worthy that two of three entries on LKA 83 duplicate passages found in two non- consecutive and broken entries in the substitute king ritual.82 Scurlock suggests that this may have been influenced by a desire in the substitute king ritual to ensure that the king was not haunted by the ghost of the substitute king (Scurlock 1988a: 343). Three of Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur manuscripts consist of namburbi- rituals . KAR 38 comprises several ritual instructions accompanied by prayers for a namburbi-ritual to keep away evil from a man and his house in connection to incorrectly followed cultic guidelines and imperfectly performed rituals.83 77 LKA 77 col. vi 25: KA.INIM.MA UL.BA .ZI.Z[I.K]E.

The entries are almost identical, disregarding variantions in signs that the ritual could be used by 207 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase Kiir -Aur 's father Nab\u00fb-bssunu also copied this ritual (RA 18 pl. 28). Maul (1994: 421) suggested, correctly in my opinion, that this could indicate that the ritual was particularly important for this family. The text was labelled as \"quickly extracted for a (ritual) performance\" , and is the only tablet from Kiir - Aur with this purpose statement.84 LKA 113 is a namburbi-ritual with instruc- tions and incantations against any kind of evil portended by a bow [sic].85 The colophon is fragmentary and can be interpreted as either tracing the text back to three previous copies or as inferring that the text was compiled from three different sources.86 LKA 119 is a namburbi-ritual to avert the bad effects of dust derived from an evil place and to ensure that it does not come near a man.87 These three rituals are discussed in Section 6.4.2. LKA 157, edited and republished as KAL 2 no. 25, contain prayers and ritual instructions addressing ama on behalf of a man with various symptoms resulting from witchcraft (kipu).88 The colophon ends with a purpose state - ment and by stating that the tablet was \"quickly extracted\".89 the exorcists when performing rituals for the king, the text itself emphasizes that it is to keep the evil from \"a man and his house\" (obv. 2: ... ana! NA 2010a: 212 and note 80; Hunger 1968: 12, 69 no. 198. The statement also a purpose statement (Hunger 1968: 12, 75 no. 219), although it may be a generic formula describing the function of such material (see CMAwR 1: 53-55, note to line 15'). 85 Reiner 1995: 88 notes an [IM.G\u00cdD .DA ]-tablet [of ...], copy of a writing - board [from Ba]byl[on? ...]\" (cf. Maul 1994: 207f.). It is unclear how these lines should be interpreted, although they likely attest to three dif- ferent sources upon which the copied text is based. If the three sources consisted of the same text or differing recensions thereof remains uncertain. Regardless, LKA 113 seems to be indicative of a level of active redaction in relation to what text ended up on the actual tablet. Similarly, Kiir -Nab\u00fb wrote a single prescription with a purpose statement during an uncertain phase, which opened with the following ruled- off statement: \"I excerpted (the following) from among many tablets (and) I collected (them) together\". Geller 2005: 230-31. \u00fa-qa[r-rib]. Such indications of redaction should be investigated further. 87 Maul 1994: 8 note 67, 52 note 86, 90 note 64, 445 note 15; Ebeling 1954b: 178-181. 88 CMAwR 1: 2-4, 6' contains a subscript designating the cause as witchcraft. This resembles a catch-line, although the line does not end EGIR-\u00fa \"(it is written) after this\". 208 Chapter 8 The group of ritual texts in this section can be subdivided into texts dealing with hostility (KAR 62, KAR 63, KAR 374(?)), witchcraft (KAR 80, LKA 157), ghost rituals (LKA 70+, LKA 83), rituals to treat mimma lemnu (LKA 70+, LKA 77) and namburbi-rituals (KAR 38, LKA 113, LKA 119). Notably, Kiir -Aur copied a text that, on a duplicate from N4, is stated as originating from ammurabi's palace (BAM 321). Unlike the prescriptions discussed in Section 8.2, only three texts contain purpose statements (KAR 38, KAR 374, LKA 157) and three ritual texts were said to have been extracted (KAR 38, KAR 374 and KAR 63, see Appendix 1).90 Because several ritual texts do not contain purpose statements, they may have served purposes other than immediate practical implementa- tion. Furthermore, Kiir -Aur copied most texts related to witchcraft, hostility, and \"adversaries\" during his mama bt Aur-phase. However, he did copy related texts earlier, such as the namburbi-ritual KAL 4 no. 7 against witch- craft from the mamau-phase or the prescription against kadabbed\u00fb in BAM 201 from his amall\u00fb eru-phase. Nonetheless, what is preserved from Kiir - Aur 's mama bt Aur- and mamau-phases could indicate that rituals against witchcraft and other similar evils were copied and practiced at a more advanced stage of his career.91 8.6 Texts Connected to the Aur Temple A number of Kiir -Aur 's texts from his mama bt Aur-phase show that he may have had official cultic duties in connection to the Aur temple. In general, N4 texts such as the \"Marduk Ordeal\" (SAA 3 no. 34; N4 no. 453) and Sargon's letter to Aur concerning his 8th campaign against Urartu no. 477; indicate that the Bba- uma-ibni family had access to knowledge of state rituals that were associated with the Aur temple (Pongratz-Leisten 2017: XXXV; Maul 2010a: 200-201; texts always represent this family's involvement is not entirely clear (cf. Pongratz-Leisten 2015: 391), although Maul (2010a: 200-201) emphasized that persons serving as Aur temple exorcists must have been connected to the arrangement and per - formance of cultic and royal rituals in the city of Assur. This section discusses 90 LKA 157 was probably also stated to be \"quick[ly extracted]\". 91 In general, rituals aimed at gaining control over other individuals, such as the \u00c9- gal-ku-ra rituals, were not mentioned in Possibly, rituals for calming angry people or hostility (e.g., KAR 62, KAR 63) are to be included in this category, although they could also be interpreted as countermeasures on par with anti- witchcraft rituals.209 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase Kiir -Aur 's various texts related to the Aur temple in order to review the evidence for his attachment to the temple in connection to his title mama bt Aur. KAR 307 likely contains part of a mythological description of a ritual con- nected to the New Year ritual cycles (Livingstone 1989: XXIV -XXV; SAA 3 no. 39; Livingstone 1986: 82ff.), which were celebrated in Assur during the months abau (11), Addaru (12) and Nisnu (1) when the Assyrian king dwelled in Assur and participated in a number of rituals.92 The text possibly explains the mythological reasoning behind elements of a ritual cycle performed in abau, connecting the king to the warrior aspect of Ninurta.93 The colophon contains a secrecy statement and the text is not dated.94 KAV 42 is a version of the \"G\u00f6tteradressbuch of Assur\" and describes the various gods that were resident in Assur according to their temples, a list of city gates, city shrines, the ziggurats of the city, and Sennacherib's new gates of the Aur temple (SAA 20 no. 49; George 1992: 173ff. ms d, pl. 37-38; Menzel 1981: T 146ff.).95 Almost all duplicates were excavated 1986: 146-48. One associated act was perhaps the execution of the \"enemy\" that may have been a prisoner (Maul 1999a: 211). 94 This text, KAV 42, LKA 137, N4 no. 110, and possibly N4 A 2727 contain a peculiar addi- tion to MU N4 no. 110 rev. SUMUN-m[a] (see BAK no. 205-207). N4 A 2727 has a row of very damaged and faint signs, which may have read: PA-u-u GIM SUMUN-ma. The meaning of the phrase remains uncertain and it is only attested in a handful of texts from Assur (Hunger 1968: 8), see in addition to the texts here BAK 228 = KAR 178; BAK 279 = KAR 164; BAK 283 = LKA 106; BAK 287 = LKA 114 (N4 no. 507); KAL 4 no. 53. AHw: 852 regards the term PA -u-u as a possibly unclear designation for a tablet, and CAD (P: 310) simply states that the meaning is unknown. Maul and Strau\u00df (2011: 108 note 15) regarded the statement as a reference to the copy in question commenting on either \"\u00e4u\u00dfere Gestaltung oder auf gewisse M\u00e4ngel der Textvorlage\" , which were intentionally repeated by the copyist in the present manuscript. Hunger discussed possible readings such as a\u00fb for PA -u-u originating from a\u00fb \"to make a mistake, neglect, omit\" (CAD : 156- 58), in which MU would then designate \"line, entry\" (umu), i.e., \"faulty (entries) like the original\". This would have the implication that the original was already considered faulty. Considering that three of five tablets with this phrase were written during Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase (KAR 307, KAV 42, N4 no. 110), it is possible LKA 137 should be assigned to his later phases as well. 95 For differences between KAV 42 and the tkultu-rituals in such stylized lists written by the Bba- uma-ibni family.96 Notably, no recensions of the text identical (George 1992: 167; Menzel 1981: T 146-47). As such, KAV 42 is the only NA source that includes a list of the gates from Sennacherib's extension to the Earra temple complex (rev. 36-40).97 The text is designated as \"written (by) Kiir -Aur ...\". 98 The first line of the colophon further specifies: \"the old gates are not 183).99 This may denote that Kiir -Aur edited the copied text. In general, such \"topo - graphical texts\" are believed to have provided theological and cosmological glorification of the respective 1-4, 167). Kiir -Aur 's text may represent a wish to create an updated version that identifies himself as a foremost scholar in such cultic matters while cel- ebrating the city of Assur. The unpublished tablet N4 no. 110 contains \"cultic\" material (see Ebeling 1954c: 115). The obverse contains several individual lines, as well as a long list of cultic materials and objects related to one or more rituals, presumably described separately as \"rites\" (par, CAD P: 195ff.) in obverse line 30.100 A section of the reverse equates various peculiar gods with common divine names and titles, and this part of the text seems to function as a theological commentary.101 It remains uncertain which ritual(s) and what cult the content of N4 no. 110 is connected to. The manuscript attests to Kiir -Aur 's initiation into esoteric knowledge during his mama bt Aur-phase, which is presum- ably related to one or more cults in Assur. PKTA pl. 10-11 (= SAA 20 no. 37) contains temple service instructions for the Assyrian temples throughout various cities.102 It is possible that Kiir -Aur copied the text, even though his name is not preserved in the colophon. The 96 George 1992: 168, 173; ms c (N4 no. 458), d (KAV 42, N4 no. 138), e (unknown), f (N4 no. 491), g+i = one tablet (N4 no. 604 and 612), h (N4 no. 608), j+k = one tablet(?) (unknown).

This resembles the writing in Kiir -Aur 's BAM 102 rev. 3: 30: GARZA.ME x [...]. 101 E.g., rev. mama bt Aur-phase ritual may be an abbreviated version of the tkultu-ritual,103 which involved the participation of the king in providing offerings in the form of a ceremonial banquet for the gods of the various Assyrian in N4 and the remains of the second line of the colophon read \"[...] of the Aur temple\".104 Based on these two observations, Parpola (2017: 102) and Pongratz-Leisten (2015: 394) have reasonably suggested that the text was cop - ied by Kiir -Aur . If Kiir -Aur is identified as the copyist of this text, his use of this version of the tkultu-ritual remains uncertain. PKTA pl. 39-40 (= SAA 20 no. 51) was likely copied by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb and is a copy of a decree by a king Shalmaneser (possibly Shalmaneser V, ca. 726-723).105 The text concerns rations for and the duties of the Aur temple personnel, although it does not list exorcists.106 The colo - phon states: \"The hands of Kii[r -...]\" ,107 which is not observed in other Kiir - Aur texts. In other contexts, phrases in the colophons related to the \"hand\" (qtu) of someone occur as (ina) qt PN 194; Hunger 1968: 8).109 Perhaps the formulation can be considered similar in meaning to \u00e0-\u00edr, as observed in KAV 42. The text's pur - pose remains unclear. Although the text does not formally list a title, I consider it likely that it was part of Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase tablets because of its association with the Aur temple.110 In general, the texts suggest a familiarization with the cult of Aur and cul- tic topography of Assur. However, none of the texts demonstrate that Kiir - Aur prepared such rituals or participated as performer, although cultic \u00c9 AN .\u00c1R . 105 Considering the text's relationship to the Aur temple, it is reasonable to assume that the name was Kiir -Aur and his title was mama bt Aur. The text may also mention Sennacherib (Parpola 2017: 144-145 col. iii 1'). 16; van Driel 1969: 179-82. Shalmaneser V likely abolished certain privileges for the elites of Assur, which resulted in a conflict mentioned in the \"Assur Charter\" (Saggs 1975: 1981: T 18-19, 16. N4 no. 330 col. iv 16': UII pKi-i[r- ...]. 108 See, e.g., BAK 10, 43, 48, 50, 92, 94-104, 107, 116, 128, 146-47, 231, 385, 425, 457-58, 464-65. 109 See BAK 137 line 3: ina UII-\u00fa i -ur-ma, \"he copied it with his hands (i.e., personally)\" , and BAK 171 line 2 and BAK 172 line 1: ina UII-\u00fa im-u-ma, \"he performed the computations personally\" (CAD Q: 194). 110 A connection between N4 and temple personnel is attested in several administrative and legal texts excavated in room 11 of the N4 house (Maul 2010a: 201 and notes 41-42).212 Chapter 8 materials and ceremonies are mentioned in the manuscripts.111 Furthermore, several influential families, such as Aur -kin- umi's family of ang\u00fb-priests of Aur and Nergal, are associated with the N4 collection (Fadhil 2012: 39; Maul 2010a: concerning the Bba- uma-ibni family's involvement in state rituals was further developed by Pongratz-Leisten (2017: XXXV), who described the family as organizers of \"the cult of the Aur temple\" and saw Kiir -Aur as the \"author rituals\" 391, 394, dence needed to connect Kiir -Aur and his family to actual performances in the Aur cult is currently lacking.113 Kiir -Aur may have been initiated into exclusive knowledge regarding these rituals, but anything beyond the possible involvement of Kiir -Aur 's family in these rituals is at present ambiguous. 8.7 Summary The majority of Kiir -Aur 's tablets with colophons derive from his mama bt Aur-phase. As suggested by his title, he may have had duties in connection to the Aur temple during this phase. Several texts suggest that he was familiar with the cult of Aur, cultic topography of the city of Assur and various stately rituals, although they cannot be connected directly to active participation in the Aur cult. Kiir -Aur 's possible duties to the temple in connection to his title therefore remain uncertain. Regardless of any possible official duties, Kiir -Aur could have continued to have private clients as mama bt Aur, which may be indicated by the purpose statements on manuscripts relating to 111 Reportedly, the administrative texts excavated in N4 do not show a clear link between the Bba- uma-ibni family and the Aur temple cult (see Section 2.3.1). However, the results of Henrietta Cseke's unpublished dissertation Die Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsurkunden aus dem sog. \"Has des Beschw\u00f6rungspriesters\" in Assur from 2002 have not been available to me. 112 Maul has on several occasions suggested that the Aur temple exorcists were involved in performing rituals for the Assyrian king (e.g., Maul 1994: 421). Additionally, texts from N4 suggest that the exorcists copied uilla-prayers originally designed for, e.g., S\u00een- arra- ikun, although it remains uncertain if they performed these rituals (see references in May 2018: 78 and note 127; Maul 2010a: 204 and note 50). Note that Geller proposes that \"the mamu was first and foremost a temple priest\" on the basis of his analysis of the EM (Geller 2018b: 292). 113 As shown in Villard 1998, only one NA royal letter may indicate a connection between Kiir -Aur and the royal court (see Section 2.3.5). Furthermore, only Aur -ndin-a 's text SAA 20 no. 17 relates directly to a stately ritual among the family's tablets with colo - phons (see May 2018: 69 with references).213 Kiir-Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase healing. The same seems to have been the case for Adad- umu-uur at the royal court (Robson 2019: 109). Kiir -Aur 's group of medical texts contain a number of treatments for illnesses not previously encountered, mainly connected to internal illnesses. Furthermore, the texts attest to the active practice of this knowledge through his frequent use of purpose statements and extracts. A number of his texts with purpose statements make use of prescriptions labelled as \"tested\". The label \"tested\" may refer to a drug's ability to regularly produce wanted results. It remains uncertain if Kiir -Aur tested prescriptions himself, but two texts discussed in Section 8.3.2 could represent an example of this. Additionally, Kiir -Aur copied BAM 300 with a prescription labelled as a panacea, i.e., a widely applicable drug. Therefore, several of Kiir -Aur 's medical texts from his mama bt Aur-phase seem to attest to practiced knowledge. This prac- ticed knowledge was occasionally considered \"tested\" or widely applicable, indicating that Kiir -Aur may have relied on trustworthy prescriptions or perhaps tested the effect of certain prescriptions himself. Finally, Kiir -Aur 's ritual texts from his mama bt Aur-phase attest to the treatment of various sources of evil, such as ghosts, mimma lemnu, witch- craft, and \"adversaries\" (bl dabbi), as well as hostility, and various namburbi- rituals . Especially texts connected to witchcraft and hostility appear to be related to Kiir -Aur 's later phases. The mama bt Aur ritual manuscripts themselves may not necessarily represent practice in all instances, but Kiir - Aur still acquired knowledge about certain rituals for various purposes dur - ing his mama bt Aur-phase.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 010 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Chapter 9 Situating Kiir-Aur's Knowledge Production The mama bt Aur-phase represents the final stage of Kiir -Aur 's career, according to the surviving evidence. Based on the discussion of Kiir -Aur 's surviving tablets in the preceding chapters, this chapter discusses Kiir - Aur 's overall text production to contextualize what he copied and used in relation to the scholarly textual traditions of his time. The first section inves - tigates Kiir -Aur 's medical focuses in his healing texts. The following section provides a discussion of Kiir -Aur 's extracts (nisus). Kiir -Aur produced a number of extracts, and these are found especially among tablets from his mama bt Aur-phase and tablets that cannot be assigned to a specific phase. These extract texts are first discussed in relation to statements in the colophons that designate them as extracts from writing -boards . Other extracts were sup - plied with numbers and were likely organized. These numbered extracts are discussed in relation to their numbering, their possible organization, and their function. Afterwards follows an investigation of the use of incipits, catch-lines in colophons, and duplicate passages in Kiir -Aur 's texts in relation to the therapeutic series umma amlu muau umma ukl head is feverish\" (Ugu), known from contemporary Nineveh, and the so -called \"Assur Medical Catalogue\" , an Assur catalogue of text incipits possibly related to a recension of the Ugu series. This analysis examines to what extent Kiir - Aur drew on a recension of the therapeutic series and navigated according to its incipits. This chapter also addresses Kiir -Aur 's text production in rela- tion to the Exorcist's Manual. Finally, Kiir -Aur 's textual production is con- textualized in the light of the scholarly traditions of Assur, his manuscripts derived from the Gula temple in Assur, and the N4 collection's connection to the Nineveh text collections. 9.1 Kiir-Aur's Overall Medical Focus Kiir -Aur 's medical texts are discussed in relation to his individual career phases throughout the previous chapters. This section discusses all of Kiir - Aur 's medical material in order to identify areas of the body upon which Kiir -Aur was particularly focussed. Dividing Kiir -Aur 's medical corpus on the basis of the tablets that bear his colophons is not as straightforward as it might seem. This is because most texts contain a number of prescriptions 215 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production that focus on different areas of interest, e.g., a few individual diagnoses afflict - ing several body parts, one illness with many varied symptoms affecting one or more areas of the body, or various conditions relating to roughly one area of the body. Furthermore, several illnesses are diagnosed without symptom descriptions, and it is therefore difficult to assess what symptoms they were believed to have caused in such generic entries.1 Additionally, the texts are not of similar length and can contain one (e.g., BAM 68) or multiple entries (e.g., BAM 9). What follows is an attempt to group the material according to illnesses and the affected areas of the body described in the symptom descriptions in the texts themselves. A division of texts by body parts decontextualizes the mate - rial to some extent, as the various body parts were not always consistently demarcated in ancient terminology or physiological conception (see Sections 4.4 and 4.4.1).2 Modern anatomical terms are, however, not useful for the pres - ent purpose either, as these tend to be too specific. Several illnesses and symp - tom descriptions are also problematic, as they can affect several areas of the body. Thus, the areas described in Table 1 7 are somewhat generalized accord- ing to the symptom descriptions of afflicted body parts in the texts themselves and as such are only meant to be illustrative. Texts that do not specify body parts, symptom descriptions, illness names, or explicit causes of illness have been excluded. Table 1 7 shows that Kiir -Aur 's surviving texts relate to many illnesses and symptoms that affect all the major areas of the body. In terms of diagnosed ill- nesses or causes of illness, a number are listed in more than one ghost, \" seizing -of-the -mouth \" (kadabbed\u00fb), tu- fever (= \" sun-heat\"), imi ti (= \"inflammation by sun-heat\"), aau, and witchcraft. Several of the illnesses listed can produce various symptoms that affect several body parts, making them difficult to group. Such illnesses include azu- and amurriqnu-jaundice, which cause various internal symptoms as well as discolouration of the eyes and skin (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 122-128; Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 32-34, 138-39), and tu, which causes, e.g., headaches, rash, muscle pains, abdominal bloating, vomiting, lung problems, or mental altera- tions (Stol 2007a: 22-39; Scurlock and Andersen both these 1 Other afflictions, e.g., sulu-cough, function mainly as a symptom, but can also occasionally be described as an illness (e.g., Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 178, 181). 2 Although not all illnesses can be demarcated in relation to body parts, some texts, such as the AMC, state that their content was arranged \"from the crown (of the head) to the (toe)nail(s)\". This description is also found in the Assurbanipal colophon BAK 329 line 4.216 Chapter 9 Table 17 Illnesses and affected parts of the body in Kiir -Aur 's texts Group Text Illness/Cause Affected area(s) Kiir-Aur ears, n)- Thorax, gastro-intestinal pl. 116A\u00fb; coughRespiratory system, stomach, Text Illness/Cause Affected area(s) Muscles, nerves, tendons, \"strings\" , and the lower body BAM 81 Makadu - Upper 400 wounds (stings, bites)KAL 4 no. 41 [Garbu(?)] [(Skin?)] (RA 15 pl. 76)(see below) (see below) Complex causes of illness, diagnoses or symptoms affecting several body parts and/or the mindBAM 40 Diku; MUR.ME GIG Eyes, thorax, curse (mmtu)\"; 10 - KAL 10 80 \"Adversary\" (bl dabbi); witchcraft hands, feet, \"Adversary\" (bl Head, ears(?), mouth, neck, stomach, \"strings\" , hands, feetTable 17 Illnesses and affected parts of the body in Kiir -Aur 's texts (cont.)218 Chapter 9 Group area(s) N4 A 2191 (Ghost?)

More problematic is the mmtu \"Curse\" that can afflict several areas of the body, although it is frequently diagnosed in the abdomen (Maul 2019: 25ff.; Maul 2010b: 135-41, 145-46; Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 506-508; Maul 2004). I label this illness as complicated, despite mmtu's general focus on the abdomen. An addi- tional problem is that several of the illness names appear in purely ritual texts, 219 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production such as LKA 70+, and if the ghost mentioned therein relates to an illness, it is likely as the cause and not necessarily as the diagnosis. Such illnesses are also labelled as \"complex\". In terms of affected areas of the body, as well as illnesses known to affect similar areas diagnosed without symptom descriptions, three groups of texts can be identified that focus on: 1) the thorax, epigastrium, abdomen, its organs, associated processes and illnesses, and the anus, i.e., primarily internal ill- nesses; 2) the \"strings\" of the body, its motor system, and the lower body parts; and 3) complex illnesses or causes of illness that affect several bodily areas. However, these groupings remain tentative due to the generalized classifica- tion utilized above. The majority of the relevant material derives from Kiir -Aur 's mamau- and mama bt Aur-phases . -Aur 's focus on the \"strings\" appar - ent from his amall\u00fb eru-phase onwards (BAM 129, N4 A 400). The same may also apply to the abdominal treatments, although the evidence is less explicit. The relevant text RA 15 pl. 76 possibly concerns a type of horse colic related to the stomach, although the actual diagnosis or symptom description is poorly understood (see Appendix 2). Cures for internal ailments are likely also found during Kiir -Aur 's mamau eru-phase (N4 A 2727). Both internal illnesses reappear during Kiir -Aur 's mamau- phase and are attested in the bulk of material from his mama bt Aur-phase as well. It is difficult to estimate whether or not the texts in these groups served ped- agogical or pragmatic purposes in Kiir -Aur 's training, practice, or personal interests. Several of the tablets may well have fulfilled all purposes to some extent. Nonetheless, several of the tablets listed above include purpose state - ments connected to practice. If the tablets with purpose statement are dis - regarded, the groups change. By excluding Kiir -Aur 's tablets with purpose statements the group of internal treatments become substantially smaller (around three texts).3 The texts copied by Kiir -Aur concerning the inter - nal maladies may therefore have been connected particularly with practice. Incidentally, this group relates especially to Kiir -Aur 's mamas bt Aur- phase, perhaps reflecting the complicated nature of diagnosing and treating such illnesses. However, this suggestion has to remain hypothetical for the time being. B\u00f6ck (2010a: 69) estimated that appoximately 70% of the first millennium Mesopotamian medical treatment texts were concerned with internal illnesses 3 The tablets with purpose statements and prescriptions for internal illnesses are: BAM 78, BAM 99, BAM 164, BAM BAM 188.220 Chapter 9 affecting the thorax, heart, lungs, liver, stomach, abdomen, waist and groin, as well as renal and rectal maladies (see also Peders\u00e9n 1986: 53). Internal illnesses may also have taken up large parts of the Nineveh Ugu recension and 2010b: 32-33), although this was not the main focus in the 2nd subseries of Sa- gig (Hee\u00dfel 2000: 24-30). Kiir -Aur 's texts appear to have been characterized by an interest in \"string\" and lower body illnesses associated with the muscles, tendons, and nerves, and a professional need to treat various clients' abdominal, gastro -intestinal, renal, and rectal symptoms. The two text groups discussed here are also mir - rored in the \"tested\" treatments in BAM 164, BAM pri- marily against internal maladies, and BAM 303, presumably against illness of the feet. 9.2 Numbered Nisu-extracts Kiir -Aur 's tablets were frequently nasa) or \"quickly extracted\" (ani/zamar nasu), a purpose statement (see all attestations in Appendix 1). The word nasu literally refers to tearing out body parts, pulling out hair, uprooting plants, and expelling demons or illnesses (CAD N/2: 1ff.). In relation to texts, the meaning is therefore to pull something out from a united whole, i.e., a piece of text from a somewhat standardized manuscript, although not necessarily from a series.4 There are two kinds of extract texts in the N4 collection: 1) those stated to be \"extracted\" as one or more select parts from a manuscript (e.g., ZI-a), and 2) those num- bered according to some principle as an extract containing one or more select parts from a manuscript (e.g., 7 nis-u). Both types can be supplied with catch- lines , which may indicate a wish to be able to locate the extract in the copied manuscript (see Section 9.3). In total, 16 out of Kiir -Aur 's 27 extracted texts, and seven of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's 12 extracted texts have purpose statements.5 Such extracts are found among 4 Hunger 1968: 2, 4; Leichty 1964: 148, 151; cf. Black (2010b: 177-78 and note 66) argues that nasu refers to an excerpt from memory of a series or work, but not necessarily a physical copy in front of the copyist (see also Payne 2010: 188, BAM 300, BAM 333, BAM 351, KAR 21, KAR 38 ( ana muepiti), KAR 171, KAR 374, LKA 40, LKA 157, N4 no. 228.

Uncertain if the text contains a purpose statement due to a break: KAL 4 no. 19; KAR abt epi: BAM 101, BAM 168, KAR 22, KAR 56, LKA 81, LKA 110. Kiir -Nab\u00fb's extracts without 221 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production Kiir -Aur 's mamau- and mama bt Aur-phases and on tablets without titles (see Appendix 1). The presence of purpose statements on many of the extracts could indicate that they were used in the preparation of a healing ceremony (Maul 2010: 212). Other texts were presumably extracted as part of Kiir -Aur 's training, such as his amall\u00fb eru manuscripts BAM 201 and RA 15 pl. 76. Comparatively, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's BAM 52 and BAM 106 were extracted for his \"reading, lecture(?)\" (mals\u00fbtu), possibly indicating an instructive purpose.6 Section 3.6 suggests that Kiir -Aur 's numbered extracts copied as amall\u00fb eru may first have functioned as copying exercises and subsequently as teaching material. As such, this use likely mirrored Clancier's proposed use of such text in LB Uruk as exercises, pedagogical texts, or aide m\u00e9moires (Clancier 2014: 55). A collection of scholarly texts from LB Uruk from a family of ipus, descending from a certain ang\u00fb-Ninurta, is used for comparison throughout this chapter (Robson 2014: 155-58; Robson 2013: 565-569; Stevens 2013: 216). Although their collection differs in some respect from the 7th century BCE collections investigated here, the collection is useful for comparison because it held an Ugu recension, perhaps differing from the one found at Nineveh, as well as an abbreviated (pirsu) numbered series based on the LB Uruk 2010b: 34 and note 50; see Salin 2016). As such, the situation could potentially mirror the numbered nisu- extracts with medical material from N4. 9.2.1 Extracts and Writing-boards Before discussing the numbered extracts, the evidence for what physical medium these and other extracts were copied from first needs to be evalu- ated. This serves to elucidate the function of the numbering system of certain extracts. Several of Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's tablets state that the content was copied from writing -boards . Examples of writing -boards have been found especially at Nimrud, which typically consisted of wooden or ivory frames with a layer of wax that could be inscribed, and several such frames were com- bined to create at least two surfaces upon which to write.7 The fragment of at least one ivory writing -board was discovered in the N4 house, attesting to a purpose statement: BAM 52, BAM 147, KAL 4 no. 44, KAR 72. Uncertain due to break: BAM 106, LKA 118, N4 no. 80, N4 no. 404. Extract from either extracted Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb, containing a purpose statement, but uncertain if it was an extract: KAL 9 no. pls. 12-13; see also Howard 1955 for a technical dis - cussion of the Nimrud writing -boards , as well as the 2nd millennium BCE Ulu Burun writing - board in Payton 1991.222 Chapter 9 the presence of such manuscripts in the collection (Klengel-Brandt 1975). That exorcists may have brought writing -boards in order to check texts, related to their duties is indicated by both literary and non-literary texts. The literary composition Ludlul bl nmeqi offers a description of an exorcist who appears to the protagonist in a dream, signalling the end of the protagonist's suffering: In the dream Ur-Nintinugga, the Babylonian(?) [...], a bearded young man wearing his crown, an exorcist, carrying a writing -[board].8 In a NA letter that is part of the royal correspondence between the king and his scholars (SAA 10 no. 202), the king's exorcist Adad- umu-uur writes to king Esarhaddon to make excuses for a late reply: I had to drive to the palace those rams which the chief cook had brought forth for me, and the writing -board was in my house. Now then, I can look at the board and extract the relevant interpretation.9 Administrative records from Nineveh indicate that wooden writing boards (lu ) were used during the assembling of Assurbanipal's libraries (Parpola 1983b: 6).10 Although writing -boards in the Nineveh collections were fewer in number than ordinary tablets (ibid.: 8), they often consisted of more than one \"page\" and could contain more text than an ordinary clay tablet (ibid.; Wiseman 1955: 4, 7-8). Due to the practical aspects of writing -boards , they were employed in some instances to \"import\" knowledge to Assyria (Fincke 2003-04: 126). Such boards must therefore have been employed throughout the NA cities.11 Based on the Nineveh evidence, Maul (2010a: 199 and note 37) estimated that writing -boards may have constituted around 15% of the total 8 Ludlul bl nmeqi tablet suggests that the writing repre - sent the text of Ludlul bl nmeqi itself (see also Noegel 2007: 73). 9 202 obv. It is possible that the letter should be dated to late June 6 70 BCE (see Parpola 1983a: 133 no. 147). 10 Were these boards used especially for prescriptions? The list provides the numbers 6+ tablets and 24 boards for \"medical recipes (bul)\" (Parpola 1983b: 6). For additional frag - ments of these administrative records related to Assurbanipal's libraries, see Lambert 1989: 95-96. 11 Comparatively, writing -boards were commonly employed in the NB temple administra- tion at Sippar Freydank 2001).223 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge of 1994: 160-61; Parpola 1983b: 4-5 note 11-12). and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts with colophons stating that they were copied from writing -boards are listed in Table 18. Both Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb extracted texts from writing -boards . In terms of the explicit statements studied here, Kiir -Nab\u00fb seems to have cop - ied from writing -boards more often than Kiir -Aur . Perhaps instead of elaborate descriptions, Kiir -Aur frequently included the generic copying statement \"(written and checked) according to its original\" (kma labriu) to his colophons, which offers no information about the medium of the original manuscript.12 12 The tablets in Appendix 1 with such generic copying statements and without information about the manuscript copied from are: BAM 28; BAM 311; Beckman KAL 4 13; KAR KAR 63; KAR (= KAL 2 8); 267; 307; Vorlage\". Robson (2011a: 566-67) suggests that such statements may refer to clay tablets, but unlike the writing -boards , the medium clay was not worth recording. The writing -boards originating from specific cities are discussed in Section 9.5.1.Table 18 Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts 201 \u00c0 giZU \u00e1 bul-i a \u00c9 a writing-board of temple of Gula LKA 113 GABA .R[I ...] ...] according ...], copy of a writing -board [(from) Bab]y[lon(?)] RA 15 pl. 76 GABA [T]A \u00c0 giZU [Fr]om middle of a writing-board 224 Chapter 9 Text Writing-board statement Translation SAA 3 .RI giZU NINAki A copy of a writing-board (from) Nineveh KAL 4 no. 44 ina ZAG giZU U[RIki] According Ak[kadian] writing-board KAR .RI giZU A-urki-i Copy writing-board KAR ina pu-ut giZU A-urki-i According to an Assyrian writing-board LKA 79 GABA .RI writing-board LKA 118 [... p\u00ed-[i li (?) ...] [... accor]ding to Situating Kiir-Aur Knowledge Production Kiir -Nab\u00fb regularly refers to writing -boards that he copied from as \"Akkadian\" (URIki) or \"Assyrian\" (A-urki-i).13 These designations likely refer to Babylonian (\"Akkadian\") or Assyrian script, and texts at Nineveh are known to have been copied with Babylonian signs and recopied into Assyrian sign forms.14 The reason for Kiir -Nab\u00fb's specifications remains uncertain.15 However, sev - eral of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts with colophons copied from \"Akkadian\" originals, i.e., tablets in Babylonian script, are found in NA script, which may indicate that the script of his texts was occasionally changed. 9.2.2 Extract Series Long works of scholarly and magico -medical texts comprising multiple tablets were often collected into series (ikar u). Such collections are known from a variety of libraries throughout the first millennium BCE. The term ikar u (\u00c9. G\u00c0R ) \"series\" was used to describe a collection of tablets with fixed entries that were created through academic consensus and editing. The opposite term a\u00fb (BAR ) \"extraneous\" seems to indicate scholarly (standardized) traditions that existed in parallel to the series, perhaps with the same \"authoritative\" status.16 A few of these works were reedited into so -called nisu- and pirsu- series , i.e., smaller extracted rows of texts presumably aimed at collecting the most convenient passages for the users, perhaps in order to facilitate eased reference or practical application.17 The word pirsu carries some of the same connotations as nisu, designating a \"detachment, section, division\" or KAR Fincke 2003-4; see also Worthington 2006: 18 and note 2. 15 Note BAM 3 (= N4 no. 90) with a colophon including a catch-line and a statement that the content was \"extracted according to an 'Akkadian' writing -board\". Although difficult to argue with the current evidence, it is possible that the manuscript was copied by Kiir - Nab\u00fb due to the reference to an \"Akkadian\" writing -board (see Worthington 571-73) has recently stressed, the standardization of cuneiform lit - erature is extremely problematic, and in many cases local differences between scholarly communities may have existed. 17 See Koch 2015: 35, 41-42; Scurlock 2014: 295, 329; Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 34-35; a commentary, the astrological umma S\u00een ina tmartu series was used as a practical tool and was quoted frequently in the letters to the Assyrian king (Veldhuis 2010: 81, 84-85; Koch 1999: 150-51). The nisu and pirsu collections of various series are gener - ally poorly studied.226 Chapter 9 \"cutting\" of, e.g., threads or texts, and derives from the word parsu \"to in Kiir -Aur 's collection be evaluated? What can they tell us about the collection and the use of magico -medical knowledge in Neo -Assyrian Assur? Looking into comparative evidence from the first mil- lennium, one can see that there are several examples of both nisu- and pirsu- texts of series, among them a nisu- series from Nineveh of Uruanna19 and of umma lu.20 There is also an already abbreviated selection (liqtu) of Enma Anu Enlil (Koch 2015: 184 and note 477), as well as a pirsu- series of Lamatu (Farber 20).21 However, current discussion is the LB Uruk pirsu- series of at least ten tablets in a numbered sequence extracted from the ang\u00fb- (nisu qty\u00fb). If Kiir -Aur extracted knowledge in a similar manner, as it is known from LB Uruk, one could suggest that some N4 numbered nisus functioned as an Assur extract series, likely of a larger series similar to the Nineveh Ugu series (Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 18 Among at least one MA scholarly family, literary works were divided into sections, each described as IM.G\u00cdD .DA (Wagensonner 2011: 652 col- ophons to have edited Uruanna anew and created the (Steinert and note 8; Freedman 1998: 7-8 with references. An extract series of umma lu was also known from LB Uruk. In Uruk, an extract could include a single omen, and the majority were designated as \"extraneous\" (a\u00fb) (Koch 2013: 243 note 14). See also the nisus from Nineveh in CT 40 pl. 8 (Koch 1995: 139). 21 The only numbered recension of bt sal m\u00ea consisted of \"sections\" (pirsu) (Ambos 2013a: 211). An auxiliary series of Enma was known as a \"guide to (rikis girri) Enma Anu Enlil\" and consisted of excerpts from series (Veldhuis 2010: 81; Hunger and Pingree 1999: 20; Koch (2015: 117) a nisu from Assur of niirti br\u00fbti. A nisu- series of 22 A comparison with the Nineveh Ugu -series is complicated by the fragmentary state of the Uruk material (Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 34 and 50; cf. K\u00f6cher 1978: 19-20 and note 20). SpTU I no. 59 is the 41st Ugu tablet and no. 48 is the 45th Ugu tablet. SpTU I no. 44 is the 9th pirsu tablet and no. 46 is the 10th pirsu tablet. For the Uruk pirsu-series , collection of umma lu omens (SpTU III no. 93), the 72nd and 73rd nisus consist of a single omen (Koch 2013: 243 14; Hee\u00dfel 2007a: 4 notes 35 and 37; Frahm 1 998). As such, it is not impossible that even the brief nisus in N4 could belong to an organized collection. However, the numbering remains difficult to explain in Uruk as well as Assur. 9.2.3 Numbered and Organized Extracts Several of Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's extract tablets have ical notations (e.g., 7 nisu). In Kiir -Aur 's case, they were copied at least at the very beginning and the very end of his career, in his amall\u00fb eru- and mama bt Aur-phases , but possibly also during his mamau-phase. Furthermore, two of Kiir -Aur 's examples, and all three of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's, do not provide a title and only append the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu-phrase, likely indicat - ing that the texts were written before the mamau-phase and perhaps even earlier (Section 5.4). The numerical notions are difficult to interpret, however, and warrant discussion. What follows discusses one problematic notation (qty\u00fb), the numbering of extracts, and, finally, how these numbered extracts should be interpreted in relation to the extracts in general. Table 1 9 provides an overview of Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's numbered extracts. 23 Hee\u00dfel (2011: 35 note 56) provides the examples BAM 52, 99, 106, RA 15 pl. 76 and a text published by Labat (1959: 10-13). B\u00f6ck (2009a: 107) emphasizes that many extracts with- out numbers were \"for ad hoc use\". For another mar\u00fb from [...] a BAM 40 may have been designated as a numbered extract, although almost nothing remains of the left side of the colophon, rev. 20: [x]-\u00fa [(nis-u?) x (x) x x]. The reconstructed nis-u in combination with a number is entirely hypotheti- cal, and as such the tablet is disregarded for now.228 Chapter 9 Text Title Extract-phrase Translation BAM 99 mama Esabad-temple in Assur ...

The numbers written in connection to the word nisu are com- monly interpreted as the number of the nisu-text in question in relation to a set of excerpts (e.g., Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 35 and note 56; B\u00f6ck 2009a: 107; Leichty 1964: 149). The question is if the extracts were organized or serialized, and if so how, or if the same text was copied multiple times.24 In BAM 9 and KAR 63, the numerical notations were substituted with words indicating the first (mar\u00fb, BAM 9 rev. 70: [nis-u] IGI-\u00fa) and (qty\u00fb, KAR 63 rev. 22': nis-u q\u00ed-ta-a-a-\u00fa) in a sequence (Hunger 1968: 2). The latter is especially problematic. The word qty\u00fb is only attested twice, and it is translated as \"final\" from qat\u00fb \"to finish, complete, (nius), Hunger (1968: 8) translates it as \"Abschlie\u00dfender Auszug\". The form AL.TIL for qat\u00fb is found several times in colophons, which designate that the copy is complete (CAD Q: 179; Hunger whether qty\u00fb designates that the manuscript in question is finished with the correct amount of entries, or if the word should be analysed in con- nection to numbered extracts as the final one in a set of extracts.27 Although the idea of copying several extracts for pedagogical purposes in order to master certain knowledge is appealing, it should be emphasized that KAR 63 derives from Kiir -Aur 's mama bt Aur-phase, which argues against a primarily pedagogical interpretation. The majority of Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's organized extracts, however, contain numbers. The syntax of the numbers occasionally differed, although 24 The famed NA astrologer Nab\u00fb-zuqup -knu (Baker 2001: 912-13) seems to have had stu- dents copy out the same tablet of a composition several times with different tablet num- bers (Koch 2015: 330 and note 922). 25 See KAR 63 ( BAK 199) and ACh Supp. 2 no. 72 rev. 9 (BAK 508). 26 ACh Supp. 2 no. 72 a written and checked copy of a writing -board with a found on Kiir -Nab\u00fb's BAM 52 and BAM 106, and it is translated as \"collection (of omens or pre - scriptions)\" in CAD (L: 206-207), and is often translated as \"selection\" (e.g., Koch 2015: 184), although Hunger (1968: 138) translates it as \"Exzerptzeilen\". Noticeably, ACh Supp. 2 no. 72 was excavated in Nineveh (K. 6478), but it was copied by the amall\u00fb [eru(?)] Marduk -allim-a presumably from a family of Aur temple uparrus, and this family is attested by several tablets in the N4 collection (Fadhil 2012: 40-41). As a result, both uses of qty\u00fb can be said to come from an environment connected to N4. 27 Section 8.5 identified KAR 43 as a duplicate manuscript of KAR 63, with one major differ - ence being the notice of a \"new break\" in KAR 43. Perhaps Kiir -Aur copied KAR 43 first and thereafter reconstructed the break in KAR 63, making it a \"complete\" copy.230 Chapter 9 they were probably meant to convey the same notion of numbering. Some numbers were written with phonetic complements that mark them as ordinal numbers (e.g., 2-\u00fa, 32-\u00fa), preceding and following the items counted. Other numbers were written without phonetic complements and preceded the items counted. Both groups must refer to ordinal numbers, since for example BAM 52 was labelled as extract number six without a phonetic complement (6 nis-u). The texts seem to have been extracted for different purposes. Only one of Kiir -Aur 's tablets was supplied with a purpose statement and was designated as being copied on the request of Kiir -Aur (BAM 99). This could indicate that the numbered extracts generally served a different purpose from unnumbered extracts with purpose statements. Other texts seem to have had a pedagogical purpose, such as Kiir -Aur 's earlier tablets BAM 9 and RA 15 pl. 7 6 discussed in Chapter 3. Similarly, two of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's tablets were labelled as extracted for his \"reading\" (ana mals\u00fbtiu) (BAM 52, BAM 106), which could highlight their pedagogical context.28 The numbered extracts from Kiir -Aur 's later phases less likely had a pedagogical purpose.29 Several of the numbered extracts are concerned with medical texts.30 This has led several researchers to suggest that the numbered nisus functioned as an extract series from a recension of the Nineveh Ugu series, comparable to the LB pirsu- series of the Uruk Ugu series.31 However, this interpretation requires the organized extracts from N4 to appear in a numbered sequence. Table 1 9 shows that, although Kiir -Aur copied a \"first extract\" (BAM 9) earlier in his career, possibly around the amall\u00fb eru-phase, and a \"final extract\" as mama bt Aur, he did not have a running total of extracts throughout his career. Several texts reveal this lack. BAM 99 was a \"7th extract\" copied when Kiir -Aur was mama bt Aur and RA 15 pl. 76 a \"32nd(?) extract\" from his amall\u00fb eru-phase.32 Therefore, other principles may have governed their arrangement. 28 Mals\u00fbtu is also frequently translated as \"lesson\" or \"lecture\". For this term, see Gabbay 29 BAM 99 may have functioned pedagogically for the assistant copying the tablet on behalf of Kiir -Aur , or perhaps the pedagogical purpose for Kiir -Aur - if any - lay in him familiarizing himself with these prescriptions. 30 The exceptions are KAL 7 no. 24 and KAR 63, which do not contain medical prescriptions. KAR 63 contains an incantation against someone angry, but should be included in this category as per the inclusion of such material in, e.g., the AMC (see Section 9.3.2). 2018b: 15. For the later pirsu- series from Uruk, see above. 32 Although, the colophon is problematic, see discussion in Appendix 2.231 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production Two of Kiir -Aur 's and all of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's numbered extracts were sup - plied with catch-lines .33 Such lines could be used to position the extract within the manuscript from which it was copied, and may indicate a wish to be able to retrace from where within a certain manuscript the nisu was extracted (Hunger 1968: 1; see Section 9.3). The catch-lines and colophons or especially Kiir -Nab\u00fb's BAM 52 and BAM 106 are useful for understanding the numbering of extracts. BAM 52 likely ended with a catch-line opening BAM 106: The colophon man's insides are continually bloated, his intestines rumble, his face seems continually to spin' (is the next entry). Sixth extract, a selection of prescription(s), written and checked according to an 'Akkadian' writing - board, a copy (from) Uruk. The tablet of Kiir -Nab\u00fb whose trust is Nab\u00fb, the son of ama -ibni, the mama bt Aur. (Repeatedly(?)) extracted [for] his ['readi]ng'. The opening line a man's insides are continually bloated, his intestines rumble, his face seems continually to spin ...34 BAM 52 is also described as an extract of a Babylonian writing -board copied from Uruk and as a selection of prescriptions. These statements are repeated in the colophon of BAM 106, which could indicate that BAM 106 was a continuation 33 Kiir -Aur: BAM 9, RA 15 pl. 76. Kiir 52, BAM 106, BAM 147. 34 The catch-line also occurs in other manuscripts, see citations in Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 59-60, 126 no. 6.51.232 Chapter 9 of the extracts begun in BAM 52. Unfortunately, the colophon of BAM 106 is fragmentary and an amount of reconstruction is necessary: The colophon to [an 'Akkadian' writing-board(?)], Kiir -Nab\u00fb whose tr[ust] is Nab\u00fb, the son ama the mamau, son of Nab\u00fb-bssunu, the let [qui]ckly go out and [...]. Kiir -Nab\u00fb's BAM the catch-line of the \"6th extract\" BAM 52. Both tablets were likely designated as \"a selection of bulus according to the mouth of an 'Akkadian' writing board, a copy from Uruk\" , and extracted for Kiir -Nab\u00fb's \"reading\". On the basis of the preserved parts of similar colophons, as well as the catch-line of BAM 52 opening BAM 106, it seems that BAM 106 can tentatively be reconstructed as the \"[7th] extract\". If so, these two extracts consequently were numbered in a sequence. These two texts may therefore derive from the same writing -board, and they could have been numbered and supplied with catch-lines for eased continued extraction.35 This could mir - ror Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru tablets that are designated as \"first [extract]\" (BAM 9) and \"32nd(?) extract\" (RA 15 pl. 76).36 Although BAM 52 and BAM 106 were consecutive tablets labelled as mals\u00fbtus for Kiir -Nab\u00fb, indicating a 35 Note that ama -ibni was referred to as mama bt Aur in BAM 52 and mamau in BAM 106. However, the different titles for ama -ibni in Kiir -Nab\u00fb's mamau eru- and mamau-phase manuscripts indicate that ama -ibni's titles may occasionally have been used in a non-linear manner, see Ch. 2 note 37. 36 As stated in Section 3.6, several of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru colophons are too broken to determine if they were numbered extracts.233 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production pedagogical purpose not explicitly in Kiir -Aur 's extracts, Kiir -Aur 's BAM 9 and RA 15 pl. 76 may have been copied as part of a group of consecutive extracts from one or more writing -boards to collect desired entries for a given purpose during his amall\u00fb eru-phase. It is, however, unclear how to interpret the remaining numbered extracts. BAM 99 may have been considered the \"7th extract (of) a copy (from) the Esabad-temple in Assur\" , much as BAM 52 and BAM 106 were possibly derived from the same writing -board (cf. Hunger 1968: 71).37 However, BAM 99 was cop - ied by someone for Kiir -Aur (\u00fa-a-ir-ma) with a purpose statement, and as such it likely did not serve a pedagogical function for Kiir -Aur . It remains uncertain if KAL 7 no. 24 was the 4th extract and KAR 63 the concluding extract in various rows of extracts. KAR 63 is, however, the only example for which an interpretation of this text as the last extract in a row of copies of the same text may be applicable. This is based on the sole observation that the N4 manu- script KAR 43 without a number duplicates KAR 63 (see Section 8.5). At least some numbered extracts may have occurred in series that were organized according to the order of extraction, and in at least one instance may have been extracted from the same manuscript. What remains unclear is if all extracts in a row or from a certain manuscript were numbered. If they were, many are now missing and this cannot be explained. Regarding their function, it is possible that several of the brief and unnumbered extracts with or without catch-lines and purpose statements may have been part of a collec- tion of preferred material of numbered and unnumbered nisus. These may have been extracted for eased reference of relevant passages from a longer text and could potentially have been used more than once, some perhaps peda- gogically and maybe later practically, some only for practice. As argued in Section 3.6, Kiir -Aur probably copied a row of extracts dur - ing his training as amall\u00fb eru. Although any interpretation of these extracts has to remain hypothetical, I regard them as a sourcebook that he drew upon during his training, although it may have remained a handy reference tool dur - ing the later stages of his career.38 In general, regardless of why the numbered extracts were copied, I consider it likely that they functioned as reference works during Kiir -Aur 's later phases. A tentative parallel could be the NA court 37 The syntax, however, is not clear. 38 In his study of ancient medicine, Nutton (2004: 4-5) emphasized that institutional priori- ties would have been different from those of practicing physicians: \"An erudite philosoph- ical disquisition on medical theory on the model of Galen or a multi- volume survey of the whole of medicine was irrelevant when what was most needed was a short compendium that reduced medicine to a manageable compass and provided a restricted range of prac- tical therapies within a single volume.\"234 Chapter 9 astrologers' use of the explanatory series umma S\u00een ina tmartu for practi- cal application over the series Enma Anu Enlil.39 Although umma S\u00een ina tmartu was a series and functioned explanatorily,40 the nisus discussed here, regardless whether they were drawn from a single writing -board or used as an organized handbook, could have functioned as practical tools contain- ing useful material that was utilized ad hoc. Although this does not explain how the numbers functioned, a single authoritative therapeutic extract series does not seem to have existed in N4, despite the existence of several individual rows of extracts for various purposes. It is possible that numbering systems for extracts were used differently throughout the various collections according to practice and scholarly traditions. For now, it is not possible to posit a hypoth- esis that is applicable to all examples. 9.3 Catch-lines and Duplicate Passages in Kiir-Aur's Texts in Relation to the Therapeutic Series Ugu Scurlock (2014: 329) suggested that Assur extracts of medical texts often com- mence with a recognizable entry from the beginning of a tablet within a recension of the therapeutic series \"If the crown of a man's head is feverish ...\" (umma amlu muau umma ukl, abbreviated Ugu) and proceed into various less obviously chosen passages.41 The Ugu series consisted of medi- cal therapeutic prescriptions and incantations with diagnostic and symptom descriptions. It is therefore necessary to discuss the possible attested recen- sions of the Ugu series in order to contextualize Kiir -Aur 's medical texts and examine how his extracts relate to the possible recensions of the Ugu series. Scurlock used two examples from N4 to exemplify her hypothesis.42 There - fore, the opening entries of Kiir -Aur 's extracts, as well as consecutive rows of duplicated entries, can be useful for understanding the textual relation- ship to the texts from which they were copied. Furthermore, Kiir -Aur 's colophons were occasionally supplied with catch-lines (see Appendix 1). Such lines quote the first entry on the manuscript copied from, which follows the 39 Veldhuis 2010: 81ff.; for this 155ff.; Koch 1999: 149-151. 40 For a comparable case of a serialized commentary on a medical text, likely ukl, see LB 24th pirsu (Civil 1974: 336-38; see also Jim\u00e9nez 2014b). 41 For this series, see directly below. For extracts and the Ugu series, see also B\u00f6ck 2008: 298; Worthington N4 no. 166.235 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production last entry copied onto the extract. The assumed purpose of catch-lines was to facilitate the transition from one tablet to the next in a series or row of con- nected texts, as well as to be able to retrace the place at which one stopped within a manuscript when copying (Hunger 1968: 1-2; Leichty 1964: 148-49). At least 17 of Kiir -Aur 's tablets, including those with partly broken colophons, include catch-lines . Notably, one of Kiir -Aur 's tablets (BAM 201) and one of either Kiir -Aur 's or -Nab\u00fb's tablets and \"[10] shekels of ...\".43 Unlike catch-lines that quote specific diagnoses or symptom descriptions, these generic catch-lines are not easily recognizable. Their purpose may therefore have differed from the more recog - nizable catch-lines . At the current stage of our knowledge, there may have existed at least two NA Ugu recensions. One is the Nineveh Ugu series, the other is represented by a catalogue consisting of incipits of therapeutic works arranged into over - arching groups known as the Assur Medical Catalogue (abbreviated AMC). Unfortunately, the Ugu series is fragmentary and a complete reconstruction is still ongoing. Before discussing Kiir -Aur 's texts in relation to this therapeutic series, it is necessary to describe the Ugu series and the AMC in greater detail. 9.3.1 The Therapeutic Series Ugu Many fragmented and multi- columned tablets excavated at the Nineveh li - braries contain symptom descriptions, diagnoses, prescriptions, and incanta- tions. These tablets are numbered according to a series opening with the incipit \"If the crown of a man's head is NA UGU-\u00fa K\u00daM \u00fa-kal -toe , consists of a number of subseries with accompanying tablets, and appears to be an attempt to serialize 43 BAM The catch-line of BAM 68 opens col. iii of the 5th tablet of the 5th subseries of Ugu, see Section 9.3.4. 44 The series is also referred to as the Nineveh Medical Compendium (Steinert 2018e). However, I have chosen not to adopt this terminology here in order to differentiate the possible different recensions of the Ugu series. of this series, Steinert 2018d: 219-220.236 Chapter 9 select therapeutic texts.45 K\u00f6cher suggested that Ugu was generally composed and standardized in Nineveh under Assurbanipal, although clear evidence is lacking and earlier material hints at a possible serialization in Babylonia.46 At Nineveh, the series was divided into at least eight subseries and included 33+ tablets in a relatively fixed sequence.47 Comparatively, a later 45-tablet Ugu recension existed in LB NA Nineveh Ugu (Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 33-34). Other contemporary scholarly series were known in var - ious recensions throughout Assyria (see Section 9.5.3), and, as discussed in the following section, the Assur Medical Catalogue indicates another (serialized) 45 The most important magico -medical texts of the Ugu series are available in copy in AMT and BAM (see Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 35). For editions of individual series, see Ch. 9 note 47. 46 Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 33 and note 45; K\u00f6cher 1978: 20 and note 32. Possibly, \"extraneous\" a\u00fb prescriptions existed in Nineveh as well (Rochberg 1987: 329 and note 12). For the concept a\u00fb, Section 9.2.2. 47 Scurlock 2014: 296; Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 32-33. The reason for the difficulty in establishing the series is that tablets were numbered according to subseries in Nineveh, and they were counted according to the overall series in Uruk (Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 33-34 and note 49). Following Hee\u00dfel (2010b), the Nineveh recension of the series was built up of at least the following subsections: 1. umma amlu muau umma ukl 5+ tablets (see Attia and Worthington 2005; Worthington 2007). 2. umma amlu mar - \"If a man's eyes are with sulu, which turns into ks libbi\"; 5+ ugidimmakk\u00fb fragment K. 3661 (CMAwR 1: 126ff. no. 7.5 ms A) ends with the catch-line col. iv 17': DI NA \u00c9LLAG-su GU-u lu U an [... lu U ...

DUB .8.K\u00c1M [DI NA SA]G ['risen']\". Abusch and Schwemer (CMAwR 1: 128) suggested this name for a previously unknown subseries consisting of eight tablets, and they hypothesized that it could be listed in the AMC before umma amlu kalssu ikkal u in man's waist hurt before his time\"; 5+ tablets (see Geller 2005: 14-15 no. 22-24, cf. 15 no. 25). Preliminary tranliterations of the majority of the medical material published in copy can be found on the BabMed website.237 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production collection of therapeutic tablets was known in Assur. As a result, the Nineveh Ugu recension may not have served as the only standardized series across all of contemporary Assyria. 9.3.2 The Assur Medical a catalogue comprising the incipits of therapeutic works arranged into overarching col- lections, and these may collectively represent a recension of Ugu or the incip - its of non- serialized individual tablets.48 The text was excavated in Assur and was written by a \"young physician\" (as\u00fb eru).49 The AMC arrange incipits of individual tablets into groups or subseries, providing individual totals of the amount of tablets within individual groups, alongside additional texts such as incantations.50 The AMC consists of two parts: a first section listed \"[from] the top (of the head) to the (toe)nails\" ([TA] UGU EN u-up-ri), listing 50+ tablets, and a sec- ond section focusing on other areas such as divine anger, birth, and veterinar - ian prescriptions listing 30+ tablets. Furthermore, the opening of the AMC may have had an introduction similar to the EM, possibly indicating a pedagogical purpose behind the tablet.51 As a result, the AMC could have been used to pro - vide an overview of the healing texts available and their titles. 48 Beckman and Foster 1988: 3. A new edition can be found by Steinert et al. 2018. Beckman and Foster (1988: 3) originally labelled it a \"catalogue of medical texts\" , and Scurlock (2014: 295) titled it an \"Ugu Catalog\". The second part of the AMC is unattested in series tablets from the Nineveh collections (Steinert 2018d: 206). Geller (2018a: 52) ten- tatively suggested the AMC should be attributed to Esagil-kn-apli, although this remains uncertain (cf. Steinert 2018c: 178). For an overview of headings and number of tablets attested in the (2018: 71) has recently argued that the copyist of the AMC may have been related to Kiir -Aur 's family and that the AMC could have from the After each tally of tablets additional material is listed with adi (EN) \"including\". 51 AMC line 1: [DUB SAG 2018d: 219-220; cf. Scurlock 2014: 295. This may also resemble the opening line of the cata- logue of Sa- gig, the physiognomic (Schmidtchen 2018: 313; Finkel 146).238 Chapter 9 Current hypotheses that the AMC represents a recension more or less standardized therapeutic texts (Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 34-35 and notes 53 and 55) that are related to the city of Assur and are possibly distinct from the Nineveh Ugu Nineveh Ugu differ in the number of subseries and the sum of tablets associated 205-206; Scurlock 2014: 305-6; Hee\u00dfel 2010b: 31-35), as as in the inclusion of prescriptions in the AMC that are not known to have been part of the Nineveh Ugu recension (e.g., veterinar - ian texts). Regardless of whether or not the AMC represents an Ugu recension, Hee\u00dfel (2010b: 34-35 and an Ugu recension dif- ferent from the Nineveh recension may (see also Hee\u00dfel 2018: 316; Hee\u00dfel 2008b). The AMC seems to have listed recognizable incipits representing therapeutic texts, and healers could use these incipits to navigate the corpus of medical texts. It remains unknown if these therapeutic texts were standardized. These incipits are therefore useful for understanding Kiir -Aur 's extracts from therapeutic texts in terms of and catch-lines . 9.3.3 may represent an Assur recension of Ugu and since it may have functioned as a catalogue of titles, it is important to compare Kiir -Aur 's opening incipits and catch-lines to the AMC to preliminarily evaluate to what extent Kiir -Aur 's texts drew upon these recognizable incipits. This compari- son produced only two parallels: Kiir -Aur 's BAM 131, concerned with aau and types of stiffness, and Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb's LKA 146, a mytho - logical incantation and a ritual for producing phylacteries to be hung around the neck. Kiir -Nab\u00fb does not seem to have any preserved lines among his texts that parallel the AMC.52 The parallel incipits col. iv 26': DI NA bur-ka-\u00fa [...]53 52 KAR 90, copied by either Kiir -Nab\u00fb, mentions in obv. \u00c9N DINGIR.MU ul i-[di ...]. 53 This text has recently been joined, but is yet to be edited in its new format. The line num- bers are derived from the original picture found on CDLI no. P394437. 239 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production The catch-line in BAM 131 is attested as the third of three associated incipits in the AMC,54 but it is also attested in Nineveh as a catch-line in AMT 51,4+, which is the \"2nd tablet\" of a partially preserved subseries, perhaps from the Nineveh recension of Ugu.55 Both the AMC and AMT 51,4+ therefore agree that this catch-line marked the 3rd tablet of this subsection. Consequently, the catch-line could refer to a standardized tablet. BAM 131 was copied from \"a writing -board of prescriptions from the Gula temple\" ,56 which indicates that the text represented by the catch-line was perhaps available on this writing -board. The choice to cut off the extract at this catch-line may have been influenced by its status as a known incipit among scholars of healing. Therefore, this par - ticular writing -board may have contained the content of several somewhat standardized tablets related to an Assur treatment tradition. The opening incipit of BAM 131, \"[If a man] is ill with [a]au-illness ... \", 57 however, is not attested as an incipit of an Ugu tablet in the AMC or at Nineveh, although the prescription is known from Nineveh.58 The parallel incipit of LKA 146's catch-line is found in the AMC and likely manuscript The catch-line occurs AMC in a section concerning divine anger (Steinert 2018a: 216). The content of LKA 146 revolves around the production of \"phylac- teries\" or leather bags hung around the neck (m\u00ealu; Stol 1993: 102), and the text contains a mythological incantation involving sages (apkal l) and Ea provid- ing 21 of these bags or \"poultices\" to humanity (Lambert 1980: 78-79, 82). The incipit of LKA 146, \"As Ea was in the river 'House of Peace where the muuu- monster gathers eggs/gemstones'\" ,59 is only otherwise attested on a LB tablet (BM 33999). The colophon of LKA 146 provides no clues as to its origins. 54 AMC line 53: DI NA 51,4+ col. iv 27': DUB .2.K\u00c1M [...]. Perhaps the second subseries see Scurlock 2014: 305; AMC line 53. The number likely marked AMT 51,4+ as the 2nd tab - let, and therefore the catch-line refers to the 3rd tablet. 56 BAM 131 in CT 23 pl. col. iv 11-17 and AMT 4,5 iv? The incipits found in the AMC may represent known titles, which could be used to navigate the corpus of prescriptions. It cannot be verified if these tab - lets were standardized.60 As mentioned above, the presence of generic catch- lines could indicate that Kiir -Aur did not always navigate texts according to easily recognizable incipits. And as shown here, Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb rarely seem to have navigated according to the titles of the AMC in their pre - served incipits or catch-lines . This does not exclude the possibility that indi- vidual texts or writing -boards were arranged in accordance with the AMC. Kiir -Aur certainly copied veterinarian prescriptions, which were probably listed in the AMC, and such material is not known at present to have been part of the Nineveh Ugu recension (see the section above). As a result, the sources indicate that Kiir -Aur may have copied material included in the AMC, albeit rarely according to the various incipits. 9.3.4 Kiir-Aur's Texts and Nineveh Ugu Several of Kiir -Aur 's manuscripts, including extracts as well as other texts, duplicate passages in tablets of the Nineveh Ugu series. These duplicate pas - sages are investigated here to visualize to what extent rows of prescriptions were copied according to the Nineve Ugu recension.61 Kiir -Nab\u00fb's tablets BAM 52 and BAM 168 are also included because of their importance for establishing the relationship between extracts and writing -boards in Section 9.2.3. Several of Kiir -Aur 's texts are duplicates of passages in Nineveh manuscripts, although these are not included, as the tablets cannot be placed within the Ugu recension.62 Table 20 presents the passages in Kiir -Aur 's texts that are duplicated in a tablet containing the Nineveh Ugu series. This table makes it clear that Kiir -Aur 's tablets do contain several pas - sages that also occur in the Nineveh Ugu series. However, they are rarely in any clear order, and do not have recognizable incipits or catch-lines that open the individual Ugu tablets. The only two tablets that contain consecutive entries from presumed Ugu manuscripts are BAM 129 and BAM 131. Incidentally, BAM 60 However, the tablets listed in the AMC were serialized, as implied by the total of counted tablets, which are said to have been \"edited anew\" (AMC ab-tu, see Ch. 7 note 33). 61 There is an inherent problem in the fact that several of the tablets represent Kiir -Aur 's extracts and could therefore have been extracted according to different principles, as sug - gested by Scurlock (2014: 329). 62 Several fragments published in AMT and BAM vol. 5-6 likely derive from the Nineveh Ugu recension. Duplicate passages between these and Kiir -Aur 's texts are occasionally found, e.g., the catch-line of BAM 351 rev. 13: DI NA bir-a IGI.ME EGIR-\u00fa, listed in the middle of AMT 87,3 col. ii 6': DI NA bir-a IGI.IGI [...]. However, many fragments cannot be identified safely as sections of Ugu and are therefore disregarded here. 241 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production Table 20 Passages in Kiir -Aur 's texts duplicated in Ugua Ugu Text K.-A.

Several of Kiir -Aur 's manuscripts, such as BAM 9, contain numerous dupli- cate prescriptions, occasionally duplicated on more than one tablet within a subseries of the Nineveh Ugu recension. BAM 9 was described as: \"[The] first [extract], a copy of a writing -board\" , and therefore this writing -board may have contained several tablets related to the first subseries of Ugu.64 The same could have been the case with Kiir -Nab\u00fb's BAM 52 and BAM 106, both of which may have been extracted from a \"selection of prescriptions\" on a writing -board from Uruk. The duplicate passages from these two texts span two subseries and BAM 52 draws its entries from various tablets of the 5th subseries of Ugu in a non- consecutive order. As a result, the writing -board referred to in the colophons may represent an Uruk tradition related to the 5th and 6th subseries of Nineveh Ugu. It may have been arranged similarly to the Nineveh tradition, but extracted on BAM 52 and BAM 106 according to unknown principles, or, alternatively, the writing -board was arranged differently than the Nineveh Ugu recension. BAM 68 was extracted with a purpose statement, and the catch-line corre - sponds to the prescription following the duplicate in the Ugu manuscript.65 As a result, the limited evidence presented by BAM 68 is that the writing -board copied from contained at least these two prescriptions in the order of the Nineveh Ugu recension. The Assur and Nineveh texts related to Ugu probably do not represent a single series.66 Similarly, Kiir -Aur 's texts do not appear to be derived from a completely standardized Assur recension, although the individual writing - boards from which they were copied may have contained somewhat standard- ized sections, perhaps arranged according to well-known incipits.67 However, the fact that many of Kiir -Aur 's texts were extracts confuses the evidence in 63 The colophon of BAM 129 is broken, and it is unclear if the text was labelled as an extract. 64 BAM 9 (2000: 53 note 3) referred to BAM 3 as an example of a separate recension of the first subsection of Ugu in Assur. Scurlock (2014: 329) stressed that the text was an extract and thus cannot be used as an example of a separate recension (see also Worthington 2006: 18). 67 Hee\u00dfel notes that the Nineveh tradition of Ugu must have been known in Assur, since, e.g., BAM 209 is listed as the third tablet of the subseries umma amlu ern kidiu ikkal u ugidimmakku, although the tablet does not contain the entire text from the third tablet of the Nineveh recension (Hee\u00dfel 2010b: Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production terms of consecutive rows of entries. It is clear, however, that the tablets with colophons rarely begin with recognizable incipits or end with well-known catch-lines .68 9.4 The Exorcist's Manual (EM) The so-called \"Exorcist's Manual\" ,69 abbreviated EM, is a collection of text incipits or overarching titles referring to series and groups of texts of the exor - cist's craft (iptu). The EM opens: \"Titles of the series of the exorcist's craft (ikar ipti) which have been established for learning and reading (ana izi u tmarti kunn), a complete list\".70 It has therefore been suggested that the EM functioned as a pedagogical tool providing a reference list that defined the ideal range of exorcistic knowledge,71 a work on how to become an ipu and expert (umm\u00e2nu),72 as well as a work celebrating the ipu profession's status.73 The title umm\u00e2nu designated a \"master\" of any craft, and in con- nection to the scholarly disciplines the title is usually translated as \"scholar\" or \"expert\".74 Seven manuscripts of the EM are known: three from the NA period and four from the NB and LB periods.75 The earliest datable copy is KAR 44 from the 68 Geller (2005: 14 no. 21) also made this observation about Nab\u00fb-bssunu's BAM 95, although K\u00f6cher (1963a: XXII- XXIII) noted that many entries are duplicated in the relevant Ugu subsection. 69 Occasionally also referred to in Assyriological literature as the \"ipu's curriculum\" or the Lenzi 2008b with further references. The title was regularly used for the king's chief advisor. However, the exact rendering of the term is problematic (Verderame 2014: 713 note 2). 75 NA tablets: ms A = VAT 8275 ( KAR 44; Geller 2000 Text E ms A = Jean 2006 sigl. A; Assur, N4 no. 132); ms F = A 366 (unpublished; see Geller 2000: 242 note 9; Jean 2006 sigl. F; Assur, N4 no. 310), the 2006: 63 note 259); ms B= 79-7-8,250 (Geller 2000 Text E ms B = Jean 2006 sigl B; Nineveh). by Kiir -Nab\u00fb (Schwemer 2011: 421), and an additional NA example from the N4 collection.76 The difficult text comprises 44 lines including the colophon, with many titles written in complex Sumerograms, phonetic Akkadian, or pseudo -Sumerian phrases, and a few individual entries provided as represented by KAR 44, is structured as follows: - Heading, obv. 1: \"Titles of the series of the exorcist's craft (iptu) which have been established for instruction and study, a complete list\" (see Schwemer 2011: 421) - First section of . 26 - Heading/subscript(?), rev. 27: \"Titles of the series of the exorcist's craft of Esagil-kn-apli\" - Second section of additional scholarly knowledge, instructions address - ing the reader and a blessing, rev. 28-36, rev. 37-40, and rev. 41-4277 - Colophon, rev. 43-44 In general, many individual titles, particularly within the first section of the EM, refer to multi-tablet exorcistic series or text groups related to, e.g., the tem- ple, cult, or court (Schwemer 2011: 421-22). The second part is more general in its text descriptions and lists various additional works that are needed to uncover the secrets behind the texts, works to familiarize oneself with schol- arship beyond exorcism, and finally a prayer on behalf of the reader.78 The lines are intentionally cryptographic and likely instruct the reader how to gain 2000 Text E MS c = Jean 2006 sigl. c; Sippar); 140684 (1987-11-3,1) (Geller E sigl. d; Babylon); ms E= BM 36678 (80-6-17,410) (Geller E ms e = Jean 2006 sigl. e; Babylon), the reverse contains an esoteric astrological text, possibly a commentary (Frahm 2018a: 16-17, 41-42; cf.

SpTU as an IM.G\u00cdD .DA , and RM 717+ may have been labelled g\u00ec-u pGI-im-dEN (see Frahm 11-15 with George (2006: 54) associated Esagil-kn-apli and Enma Anu Enlil, which may explain the association between the EM and the astrological text in BM 36678 (cf. Frahm 2018a: 16-17, 30ff.). 76 A 366 (= N4 no. 310). The colophon of A 366 is reportedly badly damaged and remains unpublished (Frahm 2018a: 10-11; Maul 2010a: 197 note 30; Jean 2006: Geller 2000: 242 note 9). 77 Frahm (2018a: 21-24) argues that the second section can be subdivided into three sub - sections (rev. 28-36, 37-38, and 39-40), and the passage in rev. 41-42 constitutes a third section in the EM. 78 Frahm 2018a: 23. The prayer is still partly incomprehensible (Frahm 2011a: 327 note 1561). For a discussion of works overlapping the EM and the AMC, see Steinert 2018c: 182-183.247 Situating Kiir-Aur 's dimension (Frahm 2011a: 325-26; cf. Lenzi 2008a: 94). The section containing instructions in KAR 44 states: Rev. 36: \"(A list of works), up to the point where you master all of the exorcist's craft (iipptu) and see the secret. Rev. 37: Afterwards, (through) \u00e2tu- commentaries , translations, and linu-lists/Emesal-texts (bilingual word lists), Rev. 38: you will learn how to explore the rituals (in) Sumerian (and) Akkadian. Rev. 39: Liver omens) (umma) lu ina ml\u00ea akin (terrestrial omens), Rev. 40: ponder (and) discuss in conjunction with each other(?).\"79 The works enumerated in lines 37-38 were perhaps \"not meant to be studied for their own sake, but with the intention of achieving a better understanding of the ritual texts listed in the 'manual'\" (Frahm 2011a: 329). Additionally, ter - restrial and astrological omens were associated with iptu, although they were not commonly considered part of the discipline (Al-Rawi and George 2006: 54). Finally, the EM instructs the reader to interpret the texts and arrange 79 Individual parts of the translation follows Frahm 2018a. KAR u-ta-du-nu mit-ur-ti. Frahm (2018a: 21) suggests that the 2nd person singular present verbal forms and perhaps infinitives or imperatives in rev. 40 may be non- subordinated verbal forms indicating three sections with individual sentences. This interpretation is followed here. The final mit-ur-ti from maru may also indicate that the discussants should come to an agreement or oppose each other. Although teamwork was advised, in order to achieve an answer through discussion, the scholars at court also disagreed (e.g., Verderame 2014; Radner 2011: 363). The word ZAG .GAR (.RA) may refer to dream interpretation or less likely to the esoteric and poorly attested terrestrial omen series Tukumbi Apindua from Nabntu as Sumerian renderings of the Akkadian qaqqadu \"head\" and may refer to the lexi- cal tradition, suggesting that the two series mentioned were aligned \"head to head\" , or even refer to an unknown illness list (Frahm 2018a: 23). Why Enma Anu Enlil and umma lu are mentioned in the last section, whereas Sa- gig and Alamdimm\u00fb are listed in the first section, is unclear (Koch unpublished: 13-14).248 Chapter 9 scholarly discussions of the knowledge, which mirrors a situation also known from the so -called \"Examination text\" and Assurbanipal's colophons.80 The EM continually stresses comprehensiveness (Lenzi 2008a: 86-90, 92). Still, it lacks genres of iptu, such as \"aggressive rituals\" that enforce con- trol over others without explicit consent, the therapeutic series Ugu, and the series muuu.81 This may be because the EM represents the \"ideal range of knowledge an ipu should acquire according to standards established in the late second millennium BC \" (Schwemer 2011: 423), but not necessarily the entirety of 7th century BCE iptu in general or variants thereof (see also Bott\u00e9ro 1985: 98-99). Nonetheless, the EM still includes titles, which may refer to prescriptions.82 Two lines, obv. 1 and rev. 27, each with rulings demarcating the individual lines from the remaining text, structure the EM.83 The former is commonly regarded as a header, although there is no consensus on whether the latter is a header of the second section84 or a subscript to the first.85 The two sections are disproportionate to one another (Bott\u00e9ro 1985: 92-93). Notably, reverse lines 27 80 Gesche 2001: 198; Sj\u00f6berg 1972. Although the examination text likely reflects OB prac- tices, the text is found in NA copies (ibid.). See BAK 318 and one of Assurbanipal's early inscriptions the tapurti (UKKIN) umm\u00e2n 1990: 319). An active oral environment likely existed alongside the written traditions, as attested by phrases such as a p\u00ee umm\u00e2ni \"from the .GA .KE Z\u00da.GIG .GA .KE u KIR.AB .DAB .BA 17 \u00c0.GIG .GA .KE MUR.GIG of every (illness)\". However, it is unclear how to understand all these titles (cf. Wee 2012: 136-37). The titles in KAR 44 obv. 16-17 may have been thematic rubrics usu- ally found after incantations, which could perhaps be combined with prescriptions (see Steinert 2018c: 181 and note 122). 83 KAR 44 rev. 27 was ruled before and after this line. BM 55148+ and Rm 717+ do not have a ruling after the equivalent line in KAR 44 rev. 27, and SpTU V no. 231 does not seem to have rulings at all (Frahm 2018a: 18 and 44, 49) ascribes the first section to Esagil-kn-apli, but he defines rev. 27 as a heading. Section 9.5.3). Frahm (2011a: 325-26) and Lenzi (2008a: identified this as a subscript to the first section,86 in part because Esagil-kn-apli's works Sa- gig and Alamdimm\u00fb appear in the first sec- tion of the text.87 The EM may have served as a reference work and perhaps a pedagogical tool for training sipus, 88 and the second section could illustrate the process towards becoming an expert (umm\u00e2nu).89 However, it remains uncertain if the text functioned as a curriculum (cf. van der Toorn 2007: 58). Considering the many hypotheses concerning the EM's purpose, the following section will discusses the content of Kiir -Aur 's texts in light of current argu- ments concerning the EM's possible purpose. 9.4.1 Kiir-Aur's Texts in Light of the Exorcist's Manual As already mentioned, there were two copies of the EM in the N4 collection. One manuscript, KAR 44, was copied by Kiir -Nab\u00fb, but the other remains unpublished. It is therefore unknown if Kiir -Aur read or copied the EM. This is a problem for any discussion evaluating the importance of the text. Peders\u00e9n (1986: 58) and Jean (2006: 147-153, 165-67) have suggested that the N4 collection held many copies of the series and text groups mentioned in the EM, although there are some difficulties in identifying some of these titles.90 The N4 collection was not restricted to the iptu described in the EM, however, and it included texts that were not listed in it (Schwemer 2011: 423). Furthermore, several of Kiir -Aur 's texts are extracts and not copies of entire manuscripts within series, as discussed above. This complicates any comparison between Kiir -Aur 's texts and the EM, as it is not always clear under what title in the EM a given manuscript would have belonged. According to current consensus, we would expect titles in the first section of the EM to appear during Kiir -Aur 's earlier phases and represent his training towards becoming an ipu, whereas works from the second section should appear later during his training and represent advanced knowledge for becom- ing an expert. However, at least two of Kiir -Aur 's texts indicate that the EM 86 Lenzi (2008a: 86-87) analysed other subscripts and found that reverse line 27 in other manuscripts of the EM state SAG .ME and U .NIGIN , and he argued that such \"totals\" were typically found as subscripts in lists. 87 Jean's 72-75) (rev. (rev. 31-36) with additional knowledge (rev. 37-42) was perhaps influenced by Bott\u00e9ro (1987-90: 226). It is disregarded here because the text itself does not support such a division (see Frahm 2018a: 21 note 36). 88 See Ch. Chapter 9 should be dismissed as a curriculum that was followed sequentially or as two separate sections for consecutive stages of training. Kiir -Aur copied BAM 129 with incantations, rituals, and treatments for sagallu- and aau-illness and N4 A 400 with an incantation and a ritual instruction for treating makadu- illness as amall\u00fb eru. The sagallu-illness was listed alongside immatu- paralysis and perhaps makadu-illness in the second section of the EM.91 BAM 129, as well as several other of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts, may, however, stem from an Ugu recension (Section 9.3.4). Yet, if the focus of these texts must be reconciled with the EM, it is interesting that another early manuscript (BAM 9) contains at least two references to prescriptions against U .GIDIM. (MA), and this entry is also found in the second section of the EM in the line after sagallu-illness .92 Other of Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru texts could poten- tially be listed in the first section of the EM, such as snakebites and scorpion sting prescriptions, as well as veterinarian knowledge in RA 15 pl. 7 6,93 and the uilla-prayer LKA 43.94 As a result, Kiir -Aur copied knowledge listed in both sections of the EM during his earliest traceable phase. Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb manuscripts N4 no. 175 and KAL 10 no. 4 contain instructions on how to perform sections of bt mseri and ritual means for removing a \"Curse\" (mmtu). Both these texts were likely listed in the first section of the EM in successive lines.95 As discussed in Section 5.2, only Kiir - Aur 's amall\u00fb mamau eru texts N4 no. 24, a \"child calming incantation\" , can be adequately connected to the EM in the first section.96 Kiir -Aur 's 91 KAR 44 rev. 32: \"The craft of (curing those) ill with paralysis, makadu(?)\" note 32, 258; Bott\u00e9ro 1985: 82-83). If SA .GIG is interpreted as makadu (e.g., CAD M/1: 368), this would fit the content of Kiir -Aur 's mamau manuscript BAM 81. 92 KAR 44 rev. 33, see Ch. 9 note 82. Similarly, N4 no. 237 from Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru- phase provides treatments for ghostly afflictions, and the unpublished N4 A 2191 contains a ritual against a ghost. of cattle and sheep, (as well as) horses\". 94 Listed in the first section of KAR 44 obv. 4: U .\u00cdL.LA.KAM. It is unclear if N4 no. 289 was listed in the EM. Possibly the manuscript N4 no. 228 should be included in the category \"mouth washing\" (ms p\u00ee) mentioned in KAR 44 lemnu and LKA 141 reconciles a man with the god of his house. Treatments related to \"Hand of ghost\" appear 251 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production single manuscript from the mamau A 2727, may have con- cerned \"Anus , which is not explicitly listed in the EM.97 Although the limited evidence from Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb-phase belongs to the first section of the EM, the texts from other stages prior to the mamau-phase suggest that Kiir -Aur was trained according to principles other than the hypothe - sized curricular structures of the EM. Kiir -Aur may not have been fully trained until somewhere during his mamau-phase (Chapter 6). During this phase, he copied texts identified in both sections of the EM, e.g., namburbi-rituals98 and rituals for keeping evil out of a man's house (KAR 298).99 The only lexical text copied by Kiir -Aur (CT 37 pl. 24f.) is also from His commentary -like phar - maceutical text (BAM 307) and perhaps a commentary on Enma Anu Enlil from Nineveh (ACh Supp. 2 24) may be from his mamau-phase (Section 7.6).100 If this reconstruction is correct, these texts are the only ones that can be related to the last instructions of the EM (see above). However, only Kiir -Aur 's amall\u00fb eru text N4 no. 241 is described as a \u00e2tu- commentary , although this manuscript appears during his earliest phase and Kiir -Aur had a younger pupil copy it on his behalf. Furthermore, the amall\u00fb manuscript N4 no. 175 was copied \"for his (own) 'reading'\" ana tmartu, although the nuances of the expression remain uncertain (see Section 5.1). None of Kiir - Aur 's manuscripts are labelled explicitly as linu-/Emesal-texts , as is the case with the EM, and ACh Supp . 2 24 was probably not copied by Kiir -Aur . Furthermore, BAM 307 was copied on behalf of Kiir -Aur ([\u00fa-]a-ir-ma ib-ri), and may not have been for instructional purposes. Yet, it is significant that several texts connected to the commentaries and lexical lists probably occur during Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase, around the time he was finishing his training. in KAR 44 rev. 33: bul-i AN.TA.UB .BA dLUGAL.\u00d9R.RA U.DINGIR.RA U dINANNA U.GIDIM.MA.KE?. Perhaps U .DINGIR.RA treatments were related to LKA 141, although the manuscript does not contain bulus. 97 Note the mentioning of \"to cut off diarrhoea\" in KAR 44 obv. 18: ... \u00c0 .SUR.KU.RU 98 29: NAM .B\u00daR.BI \u00c1.ME AN u KI-tim. also relate to namburbi-rituals . 99 For KAR 298 in KAR 44 obv. 20, see Section 6.3. Kiir -Aur 's unpublished text related to bt mseri (N4 no. 254), a work also found in the first section of the EM, may also stem from his mamau-phase, or earlier. See KAR 44 obv. 11: \u00c9 me-se-ri.ME. Kiir -Aur also copied the commentary -like text N4 no. 110 during his mama bt Aur-phase.252 Chapter 9 Comparatively, Kiir -Nab\u00fb copied a number of commentaries and instruc- tive works, although none of these are described as \u00e2tu- commentaries .101 The commentaries include AfO 12 pl. 13-14 from his mamau eru-phase,102 pos - sibly Iraq 62 no. 35 without a title,103 N4 no. 163 with the a Nab\u00fb tuklassu- phrase,104 and N4 no. 220, possibly from his mamau eru-phase.105 Tentatively, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's commentaries seem to be from around his mamau eru-phase. As such, his commentaries are from a phase in which he was in the process of becoming an exorcist. In the case of Kiir -Aur , such training patterns as might have existed in the EM do not appear. However, the lines addressing the reader in the second sec- tion may relate to lexical and commentary texts occurring during Kiir -Aur 's mamau-phase. Therefore, Kiir -Aur does not seem to have depended for his initiation into iptu on the EM as a curriculum.106 Kiir -Aur 's training may have been based on other principles. The conclusions drawn through- out this study support this hypothesis. Nonetheless, the EM as a whole can be said to represent a traditional catalogue of the ipu's craft. Furthermore, the discrepancies between entries listed in the EM and specific texts copied by Kiir -Aur could indicate the professional profile of the ipu had under - gone changes since the time the EM was composed, perhaps to include lore of neighbouring crafts, such as that of the as\u00fb. The EM was probably a learned text worthy of scholarly analysis, and the second section may illustrate how expert exorcists practiced scholarship and were encouraged to study beyond the discipline. Unfortunately, Kiir -Nab\u00fb's title in the colophon of KAR 44 is broken, but he may have been mamau when he copied the text.107 If 101 For the various types of commentaries, their setting within the scholarly environments and the terminology employed, see most recently the Cuneiform Commentaries N4 and the name of Kiir -Nab\u00fb is not entirely certain (cf. Frahm been suggested that Kiir -Nab\u00fb was the copyist behind the Nineveh manuscript CT 15 pl. 43f. (= SAA 3 no. 37), although Livingstone's reconstruction of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's name remains uncertain. Note the commentary on Udug -ul tablet 2-4, VAT 8286 (LKA 82, N4 no. 39), copied in Geller 2016 as pl. 137, which contains a colophon consisting of one fragmentary line (Frahm 2015). 106 Whether or not the inhabitants of the N4 house all depended on an overarching cur - riculum remains uncertain, although some individuals copied similar texts (cf. May 2018: 63, 77). 107 E.g., Frahm (2018a: 10), Hecker (2008: 79), and Bott\u00e9ro Knowledge Production Kiir -Aur copied or read the EM, the evidence suggests that this would have happened around his mamau-phase, and the text could have been used to reflect on how the profession and its approaches to scholarship was tradition- ally conceptualized. As such, the EM may have been part of advanced scholarly training, but it does not seem to have functioned as a curriculum in the case of Kiir -Aur . Whether or not the EM actually relates to the training of umm\u00e2nus remains uncertain, as the EM itself does not explicitly refer to this title (cf. Clancier 2014: 62) and Kiir -Aur never claims it.108 and the Scholarly Traditions in Assur Kiir -Aur copied a number of texts throughout his career that derive from various locations, such as the Gula temple in Assur (see below). Kiir -Aur therefore seems to have had access to scholarly knowledge from various cities. This section examines to what extent Kiir -Aur drew on the dominant schol- arly traditions of his time in Assur and what access he may have had to text col- lections in other cities. The results situate Kiir -Aur 's knowledge production within the 7th century BCE scholarly environment. 9.5.1 Texts Derived from Geographical Locations Kiir -Aur 's colophons occasionally include information concerning the city or text collection from which the manuscript copied originated. The examples are listed in Table 21, which includes Kiir -Nab\u00fb's relevant texts, for compari- son. These texts provide a starting point for discussing the scholarly traditions in Assur, which Kiir -Aur used in his textual production. In total, 17 texts con- tain information concerning the geographical origin of the knowledge. Only a small group of the tablets from Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb contain geographical information. Of these, half of Kiir -Aur 's and all of Kiir -Nab\u00fb's tablets were explicitly copied from writing -boards . Interestingly, their col- lective geographical span is limited, including only three Babylonian cities (Babylon, Nippur via Nineveh, Uruk), the Gula temple in Assur, and Nineveh. What follows is a discussion of this geographical spread in terms of access to textual traditions. 108 However, see BAM 303 and the discussion of a reference to an unspecified umm\u00e2nu in this text.254 Chapter 9 Table 21 Kiir -Aur 's and Kiir -Nab\u00fb's colophons with geographical informationa Region City or Place Name, Text, Copying Statement Babylonia Babylon - Kiir-Aur, KAR 230 [B]A.RI .L\u00cdLk[i ...] a The copy by K\u00f6cher of BAM 68, a tablet copied by either Kiir -Aur or Kiir -Nab\u00fb, contain the d]MA.MA or [\u00e1 URU d]MA.MA[ki? ...]. The god written dMA. MA is Nergal (Borger 2004: 274). However, his city, Kutha, does not appear to be written as URU dMA.MA(ki). George (1993: 121 no. 742; George 1992: 178 line 150) lists an \u00c9 .MA.MA as Itar -Ninlil's temple at Nineveh. The tablet is currently unavailable for collation, but if the signs read [\u00c9 d]ME!.ME!, the text may be from the Gula temple. However, according to Maul's recent collations from an excavation photo, the text now reads: [T]A \u00c0 giZU []a-an-i ZI-[a] (Maul 2019: 285). I have followed this reading in Appendix 1 and here, which is why the text is not included in Table 21.255 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production 9.5.2 The Gula Temple Library in Assur Maul has emphasized that to copy a text \"quickly\" (ani, zamar), if taken literally, the text must be available nearby (Maul 2010a: 213). Three of Kiir - Aur 's tablets (BAM 99, BAM 131, BAM 201) were copied from manuscripts in the \"Gula Temple\" (Esabad or bt dME.ME), which in BAM 99 is specified as being in Assur.109 The implication is that Assur had a Gula temple, which has yet to be discovered and excavated, with a scholarly library of healing texts to which scholars such as Kiir -Aur could go to copy or borrow the required text.110 Several temples in the city Assur were dedicated to Gula, as witnessed by Kiir -Aur 's KAV 42 from his mama bt Aur-phase. The relevant passage states: \"Egal-ma : magnificent and exalted house : the temple of Gula; E-sa-bad : house of (the lady) whose ear is open : the temple of Gula; ... E-namtila : house of life : the temple Gula\".111 George 1992: 180-81 According to Wiggermann (2008: temple called \"House of Life\" (\u00c9-nam-ti-la) that was established in Assur around the time of Aur -uballi (1353-1318 BCE), which possibly was located in the northern part of the city.112 This precinct existed throughout the MA period and into the NA period, when it was associated with the temple of Gula (ibid.: 204; George 1992: in Assur from the MA period onwards (Wiggermann 2008: 204 notes 9-11; George 1992: 180-81). Thus, the Marduk temple \u00c9-nam-ti-la and Gula's temples could have been merged at some point, perhaps into a single complex (Wiggermann 2008: 204, 211; George 1988: 34). Assur was therefore home to at least one temple associated with Gula, although the generic bt Gula (\u00c9 dME.ME), mentioned in BAM 131 and BAM 201, is not attested as one of the official names of her temples (George 1993a). To my knowledge, there is only one reference to a specific geographical location 109 Other references to the Esabad or Gula temples include, e.g., STT 73 ( BAK no. 380) and BAM 322 (see Steinert 2015: 129 and note 84). However, not all Gula temples contained libraries (Stol 1997: 408-9) and the Gula temple in Assur 110 Maul 2010a: 214; Wiggermann 2008: 211; Maul 1994: 161. Tablets could likely be borrowed, as some colophons stress the urgency to return them (e.g., Stevens 2013: 214-15; Maul 112 On the question of Tukulti-Ninurta I's import of tablets for Assur, see the following section.256 Chapter 9 called \u00c9 dME.ME: a settlement possibly of this name in the vicinity of Uruk (Beaulieu 2003: 314-15). Although positing a connection to Uruk would at pres - ent be conjecture, it is interesting that Kiir -Nab\u00fb's BAM 52 and BAM 106 were copied from an Uruk writing -board. Furthermore, Farber cautiously suggested that an overlap in traditions could have existed between Assur and Uruk in relation to the child calming incantation copied by Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb.113 Moreover, we know of the existence of a temple for the god Aur in Uruk after the fall of the city of Assur generic reference to Gula's temple in Assur called Esabad, as specified in BAM 201. The Esabad temple presumably contained the manuscript referenced Assur Assur may have maintained certain local textual traditions by the 7th century. Tukulti-Ninurta I (ca. 1243-1207 BCE) brought cuneiform tablets related to - and medicine (malart as\u00fbti) from Babylonia to Assur during his Babylonian campaigns in the 13th century.115 Likewise, a MA \"Babylonian quarter\" may have contained text collections (Wiggermann 2008: 203-4, 215). As such, it is probable that the MA scholarly traditions were based often on contemporary Babylonian scholarly tra- ditions were possibly standardized, before or upon arrival to Assur, and used as building blocks comprising standardized rows of entries that Hee\u00dfel calls \"Textbausteine\" ,116 upon which the first millennium BCE standardized series were likely based (Hee\u00dfel 2011: 171, 174-75, 192). Hee\u00dfel has stressed that one or more partly standardized MA recensions of umma lu and br\u00fbtu were circulated alongside their differing first mil- lennium standard recensions in early NA Assur.117 Additionally, a separate 113 Farber 2014: 35. An Assurbanipal colophon was also discovered among the LB Uruk tab - lets (Beaulieu 2010: 4-5, 17). 114 Both Babylon and Uruk played a role in safekeeping Assyrian knowledge after the fall of the NA 320. However, innovation did appear in Assur during the MA period, see, e.g., Hee\u00dfel 6-7, 13. E.g., KAL 1 no. 37, which was labelled as the 210th tablet of umma lu, con- tains a tablet number not known in the standard recension of umma lu, although the 257 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production recension of Enma Anu Enlil also existed in Assur.118 As such, the scholarly communities of Assur perpetuated distinct textual traditions that differ from those found at Nineveh. It is therefore of note that not a single copy of Sa- gig nor perhaps of Esagil-kn-apli's physiognomic omen series Alamdimm\u00fb has been excavated at Assur.119 presumably the umm\u00e2nu of the king Adad-apla-iddina (1068-1047 BCE),120 although it is unclear if he was a historical figure and edi- tor of the texts ascribed to him121 or part of an invented tradition.122 He is, however, generally accepted as the editor of the standard recensions of Sa- gig and Alamdimm\u00fb.123 Esagil-kn-apli may also have composed the royal inscrip - tions of Adad-apla-iddina, and he or his students may have authored the EM and the so -called \"Sa- gig/Alamdimm\u00fb catalogue\".124 Based on the independent textual traditions found in Assur and the discovery of a text fragment referring to Esagil-kn-apli, Hee\u00dfel (2010a) hypothesized that physiognomic omen series.125 The text VAT 10493+ and it contains physiognomic omens from Alamdimm\u00fb. The first section (col. iii) ends with the following subscript: number may be a scribal error (Hee\u00dfel 2007a: 4 and note 41; see also Enma Anu Enlil and umma lu catalogue from Assur and a discussion of this text in Rochberg 2018; Freedman 1998: 322-23 provides suggest a pre -Nineveh recension (see Schwemer 2017: 51). 119 Hee\u00dfel 2010a: example differing recension of Alamdimm\u00fb in Assur, see B\u00f6ck 2000: 19. For the lack of Sa- gig in N4, see Section 3.6.1. 120 Geller list of kings and scholars presents Esagil- kn-apli as the umm\u00e2nu of a broken king, after which, in incorrect chronologically order, occur Esagil-kna-ubbib as the umm\u00e2nu of Adad-apla-iddina (1125-1104) (Helle 233 16 and rev. Babylonian Theodicy (Lambert 1962: 66-67). note 19; Rutz 2011: 295 note 5). The list may indicate that Adad-apla-iddina had two umm\u00e2nus, Esagil-kna-ubbib and Esagil-kn-apli, Robson The old alamdimm\u00fb, which phrase NU DU.ME -\u00fa (l upairuu) as a statement referring to Esagil-kn-apli's editorial activities. As such, the phrase likely indicates that Esagil-kn-apli had not edited, and thereby can- celled the authoritative effect of, the older first section of Alamdimm\u00fb found on VAT 10493+.127 The preserved omens from this section, designated as part of the 1st tablet of Alamdimm\u00fb, are not listed in the preserved parts of the 1st tablet of Esagil-kn-apli's Alamdimm\u00fb (Hee\u00dfel 2010a: 155; see B\u00f6ck 2000: 71). However, the second section of VAT 10493+ largely duplicates the second tablet of Esagil-kn-apli's Alamdimm\u00fb recension, though it B\u00f6ck 2000: 72-89). As such, 10493+ may indicate that an older version of Alamdimm\u00fb was transmitted in Assur (see Hee\u00dfel 2010a: 159). Esagil-kn-apli's traditions were closely connected with politics.128 His edi- torial work was possibly connected to his role as advisor to Adad-apla-iddina (Frahm 2011a: 324-25), and the Sa- gig/Alamdimm\u00fb catalogue explicitly states that the user of these series should place his knowledge at the disposal of the king.129 Furthermore, it seems that the 7th century Assyrian kings vener - ated Esagil-kn-apli's textual innovations.130 Although it CAD P: D -stem used in relation to \"void\" with riksu \"band, bond, joint, package, collection (of tablets), structure, contract, decree\" in several examples, which may relate to the serialization, as Sa- gig is also called rikis muri u rikis kri \"the compila- 2012: 303 and line as an indication that Esagil-kn-apli was perhaps involved in providing commentaries found in the second section of the text, but he has since retracted part of his critique (see Frahm 2018a: 40-41). the deci- sions, and who watches over people's lives, who comprehensively knows Sa- gig and Alamdimm\u00fb, inspect (the patient) and check (the appropriate series), [let him ponder], and let him put his diagnosis at the disposal of the king\". 130 E.g., by referring indirectly to him in their royal inscriptions, see Frahm 2018a: 38-40. Assurbanipal also 's Knowledge Production Esagil-kn-apli's editions were introduced at the Assyrian court, it is possible that Assurnairpal's relocation of the royal residence to Kalu during the 9th century BCE prompted an import of contemporary Babylonian scholarly knowledge. Academic rivalry would subsequently have forced the Assur schol- ars to reject Esagil-kn-apli's corpus.131 Therefore, the Assur scholars may have attempted to retain their own and older traditions in order to maintain author - ity in the interpretation of knowledge (Hee\u00dfel 2010a: 165-66).132 Interestingly, several exorcists within the the title \"Assur(- city) exorcist\" (mamau aur\u00fb(?)),133 which may indicate a particular type of exorcist. If correct, the title could support the hypothesis that Assur scholars circulated particular traditions.134 9.5.4 Exchange of Knowledge between Assur and the Nineveh Text Collections Certain manuscripts indicate that knowledge was exchanged between Assur and Nineveh, despite a presumed rejection of Esagil-kn-apli's tradi- tions at Assur.135 Nineveh was the centre of 7th century Assyrian scholarship 131 Hee\u00dfel 2010a: 167. Esagil-kn-apli also was not listed 2010a: in relation to the Assur scholars' textual traditions is the effect that Marduk's exile in Assyria and Sennacherib's aktu-house may have had on the Assur aur\u00fb). (e.g., 44 col. vi 32': l\u00faA.ZU BAL .T[ILki]) are also attested. See Section 2.3.4. 134 Or perhaps the title refers to the exorcist having duties in relation to the city itself (cf. Maul 2010a: 210-11). May (2018: 66) has recently suggested that the title zabardabb\u00fb was used in the Bba- uma-ibni family because it was employed in Esagil-kn-apli's geneology. However, clear evidence in support of this hypothesis is still lacking. 135 Future research into the N4 text collection and the Nineveh libraries in general should be contextualized within the discussion of textual traditions specific to Assur and Oppenheim's hypothesis on the so -called (Oppenheim 410-11; Oppenheim 1977: 13-14). Oppenheim's hypothesis considers the Mesopotamian scholarly and literary traditions as static texts, which were handed down faithfully, anony - mously, and conservatively for centuries. However, during recent years Robson (2011a) especially has argued strongly against this view. The same text had different meanings in relation to time and place, textual traditions were localized, various users used texts differently, and innovation as well as creativity played a role in the transmission of knowl- edge (see, e.g., par excellence (e.g., Fincke 2017). Although earlier NA kings had collected schol- arly writings (ibid.: 382-83), Esarhaddon (680-669 BCE) appears to have begun assembling scholarly tablets and initiating a copying program of learned texts at Nineveh (Frahm 2011b: 523; Frame and George 2005: 278-79). Assurbanipal (668-627 BCE) assembled tablet collections throughout the first half of his reign in the South- west Palace, the North Palace, and the Nab\u00fb temple on the Kuyunjik mound, collectively referred to as \"Assurbanipal's library\".136 These collections consisted of knowledge gathered in Babylonia,137 obtained through scholars' private libraries,138 and assembled through textual production within the Nineveh scriptoriums.139 collections were largely contem- porary to Kiir -Aur . In general, scholars could travel in pursuit of knowledge or particular works, although it is unclear if this was the norm (Robson 2014: 156, 159; cf. Robson 2011a: 566, 570; see also Fadhil 1998). Regardless, the need for access to impor - tant collections, such as the royal libraries, must have been pivotal for scholars working outside of the court.140 A few royal letters may indicate a relationship between the Bba- uma-ibni family and the Assyrian court (Section 2.3.5),141 and it is possible that Kiir -Aur and/or supplied manuscripts to Assurbanipal's libraries.142 Furthermore, Kiir -Aur may have performed rituals for the king during the winter months, while he dwelled in Assur (Section 8.6). One of Kiir -Aur 's texts (LKA 70+) and two of texts (CMAwR 1 pl. 25-26; N4 no. 247)143 are stated as being copied from Nineveh texts, although Fincke 2001; Frahm 1999). The present study provides a partial solution to this situation, although a discussion of the \"stream of tradition\" without considering the entire N4 text collection is not desierable. I therefore refer the reader to Robson (2019), who has recently problematized Oppenheim's hypothesis broadly in See Robson 2011a: 570-71. It is unclear if scholarly tablets were ever sold (ibid.: 566). 141 Some of the influential scholarly families from Assur associated with the Bba- uma-ibni family may have had connections to the royal court (see May 2018: 68, 74-76; Frahm 2011a: 270). 142 concerning ACh 205 and note 53; Villard 1998; Livingstone 1989: 95 no. 37. 143 CT 15 pl. 43f. was excavated at Nineveh, but the colophon is very fragmentary (see Livingstone 1989: 95). It is therefore unclear if the text was written by Kiir -Nab\u00fb, as sug - gested by Livingstone. Additionally, ACh Supp. 2 24 was perhaps copied by Kiir -Aur , and this text was also excavated at Nineveh (see Section 7.6). The evidence for assigning these texts to Kiir -Aur and Kiir -Nab\u00fb remains tenuous.261 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production not necessarily copied at Nineveh (see Villard 1998). LKA 70+ was copied when Kiir -Aur was mama bt Aur and is connected to the Itar -Dumuzi ritual series that addresses the removal of demonic influences (Farber 1977: 10). Kiir - Nab\u00fb copied N4 no. 247 \"according to a Nineveh writing -board, a copy (from) Nippur\" as mamau, which is a partial duplicate to Kiir 's incantation N4 no. 24 (Section text published in CMAwR 1 pl. 25-26 is largely against the \"adversary\" (bl dabbi) and it was copied from a writing - board in Babylonian script from Nineveh.144 None of the texts specify they were copied at Nineveh, and both Kiir -Nab\u00fb's texts comprised Babylonian knowledge and not standardized Nineveh texts. Furthermore, Kiir -Aur 's LKA 70+ does not agree with the order of tablets in the series found at Nineveh (Farber 1 977: 24-26). Maul (2010a: 204) placed Kiir -Nab\u00fb in the last third of the 7th century BCE during a period presumably marked by decentralization and a decline of royal influence (Oates 1991: 164). Although the effects of decentralization may have strengthened some local traditions, Assur's hypothesized individuality may have required scholars to import the textual tools of rulers at the time, such as the Esagil-kn-apli traditions flourishing at Nineveh. Kiir -Nab\u00fb may therefore have studied the Nineveh textual traditions, also represented by the EM (KAR 44), in order to accommodate a new need within the Assur community.145 The N4 tablet BAM 322 is a one columned tablet copied by a high priest (ang\u00fb) of the Aur temple and consists of two sections, the first designated as \"a copy (from) the palace of ammurabi\" and the second as \"a copy (from) the palace of Esarhaddon\".146 The second section is described as follows, before the statements concerning Esarhaddon's palace: Remedies (and) ritual pro[cedures? from the temple of] Gula. Tried, selected and checked procedures, which are suitable for use. (Whenever) you perform (them), they (the patients) will be alright. Guard the secret exorcism corpus so that no one may disclose (it)! Steinert 2015: 129 and note 84147 144 For the relevant passage in N4 no. 247 rev. 24 and CMAwR 1 pl. 25-26 rev. 24-25, see Table 21 in Section 9.5.1. 145 Note that another example of the EM was excavated in N4 (A 366), but remains unpub - lished (Jean 2006: 63). Whether this predates Kiir -Nab\u00fb remains 146 Steinert (2015: 129), this subscript indicates that the second sec- tion of BAM 322 was originally located on a manuscript at the Assur Gula tem- ple. From there, it was copied and subsequently integrated into Esarhaddon's palace. Finally, the high priest of the Aur temple copied it alongside other material in Esarhaddon's palace and made it available to the Bba- uma-ibni family. Therefore, it seems that the Aur temple clergy and plausibly also the Bba- uma-ibni family had (controlled) access to Nineveh texts.148 However, this access may have been through sources already located within Assur (cf. Robson 2014: 158-59). 9.6 Summary Kiir -Aur 's medical tablets contain prescriptions for treating all the major areas of the body. However, three groups indicate a particular medical focus. These consist of diagnoses, symptom descriptions, and prescriptions, as well as incantations and ritual instructions against internal illnesses and their symp - toms, \"string\" and lower body maladies, as well as complex disorders affecting several body parts. The first group in particular may have been linked to his practice. Kiir -Aur produced a number of nisu- extracts throughout his career. Several of the extracts contain purpose statements, date especially to his later phases, and may reflect practical application. A number of nisus are extracted from writing -boards , providing insights into the role of such manu- scripts in NA scholarship. Finally, a group of extracts whose content is mainly medical contain numbers or structural remarks. In at least one instance, two Kiir -Nab\u00fb manuscripts appear to have been extracted consecutively from the same writing -board and numbered accordingly. Kiir -Aur copied at least two numbered amall\u00fb eru manuscripts from a hypothesized consecutive row of training material, which could have been extracted from a single writing - board. The numbered extracts from N4 do not presently attest to a nisu- series , but instead to texts presumably extracted for various purposes in relation to training and practice. 148 Maul 2010a: 205 and note 53, 218-20; Villard 1998; see May 2018: 76; Hee\u00dfel 2017: 375. Current theories propose the association of the royal court, temples, and scholars hin- dered critical and individual thought (e.g., Frahm 2011b: 525-26). When more of the relationships between the Assur, Kalu and Nineveh libraries have been examined, such ideas should be discussed further.263 Situating Kiir-Aur 's Knowledge Production Kiir -Aur 's texts were also analysed in relation to the Nineveh Ugu series and the possibly differing Assur recension represented by the incipits cata- logued In relation to the AMC, Kiir -Aur rarely copied these incipits. His occasional use of generic and hardly recognizable catch-lines indi- cates that his texts were copied according to other principles. Furthermore, a comparison between Kiir -Aur 's texts and the known portions of the Nineveh Ugu series revealed that Kiir -Aur 's extracts are rarely extracted in any discernable order. This could indicate that the manuscripts from which Kiir -Aur copied were not standardized according to the Nineveh Ugu recen- sion. Yet, some manuscripts not explicitly labelled as extracts, such as BAM 129, duplicate consecutive entries from a manuscript possibly belonging to the Nineveh Ugu series. At present, it is therefore unclear what determined the structure of Kiir -Aur 's extracts. Nonetheless, it is clear that they represent knowledge that was utilized for pragmatic purposes. Finally, Kiir -Aur does not seem to have followed the EM as a curriculum for becoming an ipu. Therefore, by following the microhistoric approach Chapter 9 has challenged and contrasted numerous theories concerning the training of exorcists and their use of knowledge.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 011 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Chapter 10 Synthesis and Conclusion This study has provided the first detailed analysis of a particular ipu's edu- cation and practice. A number of surprising features have been illuminated through the analysis of Kiir -Aur 's education, which indicates that it was dif- ferent from what we would expect. Kiir -Aur copied prescriptions related to the treatment of snakebites, scorpion stings and horses as amall\u00fb eru. All three areas of healing consist of prescriptions and they are usually regarded as uncommon in Mesopotamian healing. The study showed that these areas of healing likely provided Kiir -Aur with a conceptual framework for interpret - ing the overwhelming powers of venomous liquids, which could be used for understanding the physiological processes of the human body. The venoms were generally compared to the bile found in mammals, which may have pro - vided an explanatory physiological framework. In relation to the veterinarian prescriptions, it is possible that Kiir -Aur used knowledge about animal anat - omy to gain an understanding of the internal mechanisms of the human body. Additionally, it was proposed that he could have practiced horse treatments and it may be possible to extrapolate from this that Kiir -Aur also acted as a veterinarian. Kiir -Aur also copied several medical manuscripts with diag - noses, symptom descriptions, and treatments of various illnesses. These thera- peutic texts appear to have been copied according to assignments focusing on an anatomical or physiological area of the body, according to a specific ailment, or handpicked sections from a collection of prescriptions. Concerning his di- agnostic capabilities, Kiir -Aur may have been trained in diagnostics through a combination of the therapeutic texts from his amall\u00fb eru-phase and oral teachings. Significantly, according to the surviving evidence he never copied Sa-gig, which is assumed to have been the primary tool with which to learn di- agnostic principles. The numbered extracts that he produced as amall\u00fb eru may have provided him with the most useful text passages for acquiring all the abovementioned skills. Additionally, Kiir -Aur was trained in methods for treating causes of illness by petitioning or influencing the responsible deity through prayer, ritual actions, and substitution. Surprisingly, he also seems to have taught basic scribal skills to at least one younger pupil. After his amall\u00fb eru-phase, Kiir -Aur copied rituals for removing the affliction \"Curse\" and gaining an overview of the confinement ritual bt mseri. As amall\u00fb mamau eru, he copied texts intended to soothe ghosts or per - sonal gods in a domestic setting. During this phase, he also copied a text for 265 Synthesis and Conclusion prophylactically calming a baby or child. It is possible that the texts he cop - ied provided a continuous focus on knowledge related to understanding and learning how to practice healing. I presented evidence to suggest that Kiir - Aur may himself have acted as a paediatrician during this phase. Although child calming rituals are known to have been part of the ipu's proficiencies, it is interesting that it appears at this point in his training, after a period in which he studied texts related first primarily to medicine and afterwards aimed at performing and understanding more advanced rituals. During the mamau amall\u00fb eru-phase he also copied texts for treating possible domestic causes of misfortune. This process, I suggested was intended to widen the young ipu's scope from individual, to house, to cult, to family, and following the mamau eru-phase, to entire households. Kiir -Aur , while probably trained under his father's supervision, may therefore have experienced increased autonomy in certain areas of practice during some phases. It is possible that he treat - ed animals as amall\u00fb eru and later infants, babies, or children as amall\u00fb mamau eru, with increased autonomy in order to gain more experience. Additionally, it is also possible that this sequence of medical training was the result of an intrinsic ethical and economic system, which allowed greater room for medical errors on animals and to some extent on young children. This sug - gestion is based on the observation that animals could be replaced through economic compensation, whereas the failed treatment of an infant, baby, or child could perhaps damage the healer's social reputation. It is therefore pos - sible that medical incompetence in relation to adult healing was the only form of negligence that could potentially terminate a healer's practice. The mamau eru-phase was the first time since the amall\u00fb eru-phase that he copied prescriptions (bulu). Furthermore, these were described as \"tested\" procedures. When Kiir -Aur became mamau, he surprisingly does not seem to have been fully trained. It is likely that he was not allowed to su- pervise rituals and perform house calls on his own until sometime during this phase. Yet, the material attests to an increase in authority, as he copied rituals designed for conducting house calls and rituals for protecting entire house - holds during this phase. He had previously acquired insight into such rituals as amall\u00fb. Furthermore, the fact that purpose statements and namburbi- rituals generally do not appear before this phase indicates that these were ele - ments connected with supervising rituals and conducting house calls without supervision. A significant result of this monograph relates to practical, as opposed to abstract, theoretical knowledge. Many of Kiir -Aur 's tablets appear to be extracts in some form. Some tablets were numbered according to obscure principles, possibly numbering excerpts extracted from larger texts, whereas 266 Chapter 10 other manuscripts were simply mined for Kiir -Aur 's practice. What is clear, however, is that Kiir -Aur 's texts often seem to have been copied and extract - ed for specific purposes, such as training and practice. They therefore reflect practiced knowledge. Kiir -Aur 's use of tested prescription, and perhaps his own test of at least one prescription, during his mama bt Aur-phase, coupled with many purpose statements on medical and ritual tablets from the mamau- and mama bt Aur-phases , as well as on tablets without titles, attest to the practical implementation of this knowledge. It appears that as mama bt Aur he may have depended on fewer but more trustworthy prescriptions, of which at least one prescription was universally applicable. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that rituals connected to witchcraft and hostility were related to Kiir -Aur 's later career phases. Overall, Kiir -Aur 's medical texts may be assigned to three major groups relating to: internal, renal, and rectal illnesses; illnesses affecting the \"strings\" , the motoric system, and the lower extremities; and a limited number of com- plex illnesses or causes of illness. In particular, the group concerning internal, renal, and rectal illnesses seems to be part of Kiir -Aur 's practice. Whether or not these areas reflect his personal specialization(s), or whether he even had an area of specialization, remains uncertain. Furthermore, if the major - ity of his texts had a practical dimension, it is probable that the texts from his mama bt Aur-phase related to the Aur temple were practical tools used in connection to specific duties, to familiarize Kiir -Aur with the cult of Aur, or as models that were modified according to need. From a microhistorical point of view, this study provides a foundation for fur - ther in depth analyses of individual healers' training and practice. Surprisingly, Kiir -Aur rarely produced exact copies with colophons of the established se - ries, and some texts are only known from his manuscripts or from duplicates in the N4 collection. Although this is not necessarily proof of an idiosyncratic scholarly environment in N4, it does indicate that the texts Kiir -Aur copied and used occasionally fell outside the parameters we know from the royal col- lections in Nineveh. It is possible that his texts reflect textual traditions specific to the scholarly environments of the city of Assur. However, Kiir -Aur 's cop - ies of texts from these traditions indicate that they were part of his training and practice. Kiir -Aur does not appear to have been trained according to current interpretations of the Exorcist's Manual, although the limited num- ber of scholarly texts from around his mamau-phase may reflect the wider range of advanced scholarship that was encouraged in the second part of the EM. Thus, the evidence presented cautiously speaks in favour of abandoning the EM as a verbatim curriculum for becoming an ipu. The inclusion in Kiir - Aur 's training and practice of texts of other and different types of medical 267 Synthesis and Conclusion knowledge than are explicitly listed in the EM may indicate that the profes - sional profile of the exorcist had undergone changes since the time the EM was composed. However, this question requires further analysis, ideally combined with a discussion of the development of the ipu profession in later periods. By investigating the small mysteries of medical practice that individual manuscripts presented, this study has examined the wider use of veterinar - ian and paediatric knowledge in Mesopotamia. Furthermore, physiology has rarely been discussed in relation to whether or not a Mesopotamian concep - tion of internal underlying processes existed. Building on previous research, I hypothesized that a system concerning fluids, such as venom and bile, may have been used in metaphoric relationships to establish a conception of how some aspects of the internal parts of the body functioned. Therefore, by considering all of a single ipu's texts from his entire career, it is possible to achieve a more diverse understanding of the purposes that in- dividual texts may have served, independent of genre labels. This monograph has provided a well-rounded and holistic analysis that emphasises emic per - spectives with the added etic background where necessary. The publication of further tablets will potentially modify these results, yet such modifications will not significantly change the conclusions drawn concerning Kiir -Aur as a case study of a practitioner working at a specific time, in a certain location. This study has striven towards not overemphasizing particular individual fea- tures, as well as accounting for the amount of unattainable knowledge, such as oral teachings. However, both the fragmentary material and the method have their limits and many of the results remain, unavoidably, hypothetical. Therefore, this study does not hold all the answers regarding Kiir -Aur 's magico -medical focuses or the impact they had on his career. Further research into the orthography and spelling habits of Kiir -Aur and his family may en- able additional N4 texts to be assigned to specific members of the Bba- uma- ibni family. However, a comprehensive examination of such features is beyond the scope of the present analysis. Nonetheless, comparative texts and general theories have provided the necessary background and supporting information, in accordance with the microhistoric approach, to support my observations about Kiir -Aur . In a broader perspective, a number of preliminary observations regarding the similarities and differences between Kiir -Aur and contemporary ipus at the royal court might highlight possible areas for future studies. A few ex - orcists at the royal court in Nineveh may have overseen the treatment of chil- dren in addition to adults (see Section 5.2.2). The arguments presented here, regarding Kiir -Aur 's hypothesized practice as a paediatrician, indicate that such duties may have been part of some exorcists' professional obligations. 268 Chapter 10 However, we currently know little about the concrete development in patient groups or changing responsibilities of other individual healers. The letters and reports from Nineveh suggest that court ipus never quoted Sa- gig, and at least one exorcist tested a prescription before use on patients (see Sections 3.6.1 and 8.3.1). Therefore, current research tentatively implies that some ipus at court depended on, e.g., experience in their practice. Kiir -Aur did not copy Sa-gig, as far as we know. Furthermore, Kiir -Aur also depended on ex - perience to some degree, as well as pragmatism, which is evidenced by his use of fewer trusted prescriptions in later phases and the proposed test of a pre - scription during his mama bt Aur-phase. Yet, other aspects of Kiir -Aur 's practice perhaps contrast that of exorcists in Nineveh. While rituals at court could be copied in their entirety for what may have been strict performances (see Section 7.4), Kiir -Aur 's manuscripts demonstrate how relevant sections of both medical and ritual texts were chosen and copied for concrete purpos - es. Some such texts likely served as aide m\u00e9moires, and rituals were perhaps adapted according to specific circumstances. While Kiir -Aur and his family perhaps had occasional professional con- tact with the Assyrian kings, little evidence suggests he had direct access to the Nineveh court and its scholarly knowledge. Like one exorcist at court, Kiir - Aur perhaps had private clients as mama bt Aur in addition to his pos - sible duties at the Aur temple (see Section 8.7). Unlike the letters and reports from the Nineveh exorcists, Kiir -Aur 's manuscripts provide us with schol- arly texts copied for specific professional purposes, and they show how he op - erated within a local and distinctive scholarly environment. Thus, Kiir -Aur primarily acquired texts via the local learned community and its institutions. Although Kiir -Aur was not part of the inner circle of scholars at Nineveh, certain aspects of how he practiced his profession seem to be roughly similar to some of the routines of the ipus at the royal court. Yet, other aspects of his practice do not appear to be comparable. It remains possible, however, that the conclusions drawn regarding Kiir -Aur 's training and career are not generally applicable to wider medical practices in Mesopotamia, and perhaps not even in the NA period. These questions require further research, and they will hope - fully be addressed in the future. Yet, this study has shown that Kiir -Aur 's texts reveal a localized tradition of medical knowledge. By focusing on practical rather than abstract knowledge, the case of Kiir - Aur provides a contextualized and comprehensive study of how medical knowledge in all forms was used by a specific ancient healer. Consequently, this work not only adds to our knowledge of how ancient texts were used, but differs significantly from some contributions on Mesopotamian medicine. It is therefore my hope that it serves as a step towards gaining a deeper understand- ing of medical practices in ancient Mesopotamia.\u00a9Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, 2021|doi:10.1163/9789004436084_ 012 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.Appendix 1 Catalogue of Texts The following catalogue lists the texts in which the colophon includes Kiir-Aur's name, the remains of his name (Kiir-[...]), or texts that are discussed in relation to Kiir-Aur throughout this monograph.

As such, it serves as the main manuscript for this edition. It was copied, transliterated, and translated in Scheil 1918. However, Scheil's copy is problematic in several places (see the commentary below). Unfortunately, Scheil provided no inventory number, collection name, or other indications as to the location of the tablet. Consequently, it is currently considered lost and Scheil's copy is the basis for my emendations of what I assume must be incorrectly copied signs. As the majority of the incorrect signs appear to have either too many or too few strokes, it is possible that Scheil copied the tablet according to a picture without further collation. Furthermore, it is difficult to interpret whether the right edge on the obverse and reverse was the slightly damaged edge of the tablet or if ms A broke off from a multi- columned tablet. I assume that the manuscript was single -columned. For further discussion of this text, see Section 3.5 and Chapter 4. The obverse of ms A contains prescriptions related to applying or anointing various substances onto bites and stings or drinking and eating certain potions or substances. Although several plants remain unidentified, it is possible that the effect of applying these various plants could in some instances induce diffusion so that the venom would be (partially) extracted from the bite/sting. Note that some of the same plants used in individual prescriptions in ms A-C against snakebite are also used in the single potion (maqtu) consisting of 13 plants that are drunk in wine against snakebite in BAM 176 (see Geller 2014: 18 note 26). The translation of prescriptions ending in (verbal form)-ma TI/ina-e are translated as \"he (drinks/eats/etc.) ..., and he will live\" , although it should be noted that Scurlock has argued that these constructions designate \"a subordinate 'if' clause\" (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: xvi with further references). I have left this possible distinction out of the translations, as it would make the content too confusing. Ms A has dividing lines after obv. 11' and 13' , which separate the entry in obv. 12'-13'. This entry is the only prescription on the obverse that is longer than a single line. Ms A breaks off after obv. 25'. The beginning of the reverse of ms A is broken. Dividing lines occur after rev. 4' and rev. 8'. The colophon in obv. 9'-15' breaks off after rev. 15' , although it remains uncertain if more lines once existed. Two plant lists, CT 14 pl. 23 (K. 9283) and STT 92, which list ingredients, maladies, and methods for administering the drugs, partially duplicate individual lines of ms A. Both plant lists are unedited, although see B\u00f6ck 2014a: 156 for STT 92. CT 14 pl. 23 gener - ally contains Babylonian sign forms. Of note, both lists provide the lines on ms A obv. 7'-11' in roughly the same order with infinitive verbal forms (see below). It therefore seems that the lines in ms A originally originated from a plant list.332 Appendix 2 Commentary Obverse 1' Ms A is difficult to reconstruct, as there are few readable signs. It is possible that the line duplicated ms B rev. 63, which is taken as the basis for com- parison. Geller (2014: 18 note 26) reads SUU instead of \u00fa?. Hee\u00dfel (2010c: 154) only reads urbatu, which is followed here. Furthermore, in ms C the root (SUU) of the urbatu-plant is peeled (qalpu), see CAD (Q: 58-59). The verb naku ordinarily has the thematic vowels a/u and it is rarely attested with i/i (CAD N/2: CDA : 244; AHw: 758). Ms C has /i/ as the thematic vowel, which indicates the verb had undergone a change (see Kouwenberg 2010: 77-78; von Soden 1995: 141 \u00a787d). The passage from ms C is one of the only instances quoted in the CAD. For the urbatu-plant, see obv. 9'. 1'-6' Ms B ends the prescriptions with the stative n\u00e9-e rather than ms A's more com- mon ina-e \"to live, stay alive, recover\" BAM 42 was excavated in the N4 collection and copied by a certain Aur -kin- umi with- out a title and with a broken tablet designation. For Aur -kin- umi, see Fadhil 120-122; Maul 2010a: 216 note 101. There does not appear to be a copying statement in the colophon. According to Finkel (1999: 213 note 3), the snake treatments were added in a smaller hand, perhaps as an \"afterthought\". For the overlap between these two tablets, see Section 3.5.1. 2' Obv. 2' in ms A may have combined the two individual prescriptions found in ms B rev. 64. Ms A contains the instructions NAG?-ma and GAR -an, which match the individual instructions in the two prescriptions found in ms B rev. 64. If this interpretation is correct, ms A should also contain the phrase ina UGU before ni-ki-\u00fa. However, the remaining wedges do not entirely sup - port this, and I therefore transliterate <ina> UGU?. The plant used in ms B -C is \u00faIGI-lim called imur-lm \"it cures a thousand is described in ammu ikinu as hav - ing the tendrils of the qi\u00fb- gourd , the seed of the urtu-plant, a bitter as well as soft root, and red -golden offshoots (see 10 \u00a723-24, 19 \u00a714). It can be used against every kind of sore and \"'the Furious One' , a deputy (an\u00fb) of Adad\" 2012: 16; Stadhouders 2011: 35). The plant listed in the \"Dreckapotheke\" section of Uruanna as \"dust from the [SAA]R 23). Imhur- lm also appears in BAM 1 col. i 58 50 (Attia and Buisson 2012: 27-28; CAD T: 62).333 Edition of RA 15 pl. 76 The plant list STT 92 col. i 5 probably had a similar entry: \u00da IGI-lim : \u00da Z\u00da [MU : x x x x(?)], \"The plant imur-lm : a plant (for) [snake] bite [...]\". 3' Ms A is very fragmentary, but may duplicate the second prescription in ms B rev. 65-66a. Both prescriptions in ms B rev. 65-66a are quoted for reference. The addition in ms B rev. 65 of <n\u00e9-e> follows Hee\u00dfel (2010c: 154). The reconstruction [giE].N\u00c1 .A in ms B seems to fit the line, and is also fol- lowed by Hee\u00dfel (2010c: 154) and Geller (2014: 18 note 26). The un\u00fb-plant was likely a shrub or perhaps a \"chaste tree\" (CAD /3: 309-10; see 74'; CMAwR 2: with further references). In Uruanna's \"Dreckapotheke\" section, ulu qarnn\u00fb is equated with the names un\u00fb and baltu (Rumor 2017: 20, 31 line 115; see also CMAwR 1: 473; Geller 2005: 3). In the pharmacological-therapeutic compendium BAM 1, the un\u00fb-plant can be crushed in oil and anointed onto the affected area to treat an illness ([DA ]B \u00e1-da-ni, possibly a type of fever, see B\u00e1cskay 2018: 146ff.), and the root can be crushed into oil and drunk in good beer against sulu-cough or au-phlegm (Attia and Buisson 2012: 26 col. i 40, 27 col. ii 31, 28 col. ii 44, 30 col. iv 14). The aumtu-plant in ms B rev. 65 is connected to the healing goddess Gula and is stated in Uruanna to be her plant 514). The plant is unidentified, but according to BAM 1 it is effective against imi ti if drunk in good beer and anointed onto the affected area, against a\u00fb-illness if drunk in good beer, and it can be crushed into hot ghee and anointed onto the affected area (Attia and Buisson 2012: 26 col. i 49, 27 col. ii 3 and col. ii 19; see also CMAwR 1: 234, 472). In Uruanna's \"Dreckapotheke\" section, the plant is referred to as \"the head of a black raven\" and \"wool of a virgin ewe\" (Rumor 2017: 19, 22, 30 line 103, 31 line 123). Another pharmacological text describes the plant as a drug \"for keeping vermin out of a man's house. You put it in water and sprinkle the house with it\" (Stadhouders 2012: 17 col. iv 20-21; Stadhouders 2011: 37 col. iv 20-21). It was believed to be effective to deter wild animals (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 162-163, 168). The uumtu-plant's name may refer to something going out (wa\u00fb), perhaps indicating some excreta (see B\u00f6ck 2014a: 159). These excreta could be from the plant itself or perhaps the wound once the plant was applied. The kamkadu-plant in ms B rev. 65 is unidentified (see 2005: 47). In sufficient quantities, the plant was considered a bad omen and the 59th tablet of umma lu line 35 states: \"If kamkadu-plant becomes thick, that field will be abandoned\" (see also the 55th tablet line 5; Freedman 2017: 99, 103, 126). The \"Dreckapotheke\" section of Uruanna refers to the plant as \"an 334 Appendix 2 iqippu- earthworm \" or perhaps 2017: 5, 25 line 8; see CAD I-J: 261). The second interpretation is perhaps more plausible as in BAM 1 the plant is placed on a wound against the problem \"spur(?) of the bird\" crocus\" (CMAwR 1: 468; see CMAwR 2: 508 with references). In comparison, OB texts mention the plant in relation to aromat - ics (Middeke -Conlin 2014: 26, 39). The plant is used in a prescription against chest pains (Maul and Strau\u00df 2011: 101-102 col. ii' (B\u00e1cskay 2017: 51). The andau-plant occurs in BAM 1, which states it could be drunk against sulu- cough or qu-illness (Attia and Buisson 2012: 27 col. ii 33 and col. ii 40). An omen in the 55th tablet of umma lu refers to someone growing the plant in a field: \"If ditto ((someone) grows) andau-plant ditto (in a field), an enemy will carry off his equipment; ill health will be in store for him\" (Freedman 2017: 101 line 62'). The writing is the only prescription in ms A and C referring to the bite as a simmu. For the final verbal form, see also CAD K: 239-240. 5' The tarmu-plant T: 238-39; CMAwR 2: 515; CMAwR 1: 473 with references). The plant is also used in BAM 1 col. ii 52 (Attia and Buisson 2012: 28). The \"Dreckapotheke\" section of Uruanna lists the plant as \"fat of a male pig mottled with red\" , \"fat from the kidneys of a white pig mottled with red\" , and \"dust from the footstep of a annu(?)-man \" (Rumor 2017: 11, 28 line 51). Ms B rev. 67' comprises two entries. The second half of the line does not appear in ms A. Geller (2014: 18-19 note 26) reads ms B rev. 67'b as follows: DI MIN gimi-URU -i-giM\u00c1-ra! ina \u00d9-\u00fa -ma n\u00e9-e, \"If ditto, you keep applying mirimara during his sleep, and he will get better\" (see Hee\u00dfel 2010c: 154). 6' The pill\u00fb-plant is often interpreted as \"mandrake\" , although this remains uncertain. Recently, Kinnier Wilson has suggested the plant may have been a species of mistletoe (see discussion with further references in The plant is regularly attested in a \"male\" variant that is also the one used in mss A and B. H owever, only ms A prescribes using the root of the plant. The pill\u00fb-plant is among a few select plants that demand certain attention when pulled out of the ground (see B\u00f6ck 2014a: 158 and note 84 with further references). The ambivalent nature of the plant can be read in an entry in the 59th tablet of umma lu line 26: \"If pill\u00fb-tree(?) grows(?), the people's health will not be 335 Edition of RA 15 pl. 76 good\" (Freedman 2017: 126). In Uruanna's \"Dreckapotheke\" section, the pill\u00fb- plant is referred to as \"black (spot/hair?) from the (upper) leg of a donkey\" or the \"nail of a black dog\" (Rumor 2017: 10, 27 lines 44-45; see also ibid.: 18, 30 line 94). The plant has a wide range of uses (e.g., Scurlock 2014: 400, 436, 478, 494, 519, 526-27, 541, 547; cf. Attia and Buisson 2012: 26 col. i 1, 30 col. iv 2). The reading \u00c1D?.DU? remains tentative. Hee\u00dfel (2010c: 154) inter - preted this as an instruction to the reader similar to S\u00daD (see also Geller 2014: 18-19 note 26). I read this as an adjective, which is also a possibility with this Sumerogram, as the process of drying would have taken too long in relation to the presumed immediate use of such a prescription. The plant list CT 14 pl. 23 obv. 9 may also prescribe the root of the pill\u00fb- plant, to be placed around the neck of the patient: [\u00da SUU]?? NAM .TAR . RA ina G\u00da-\u00fa GAR -an, \"[...] pill\u00fb-plant : a plant (for) snake - bite : you place (it) around his neck\". 7' The plant barraqtu seems to be attested exclusively in connection to snake - bites and there are therefore relatively few references to it (see CAD B: 113). An alternative name listed in Uruanna for this plant is zarratu, which is only attested lexically (CAD Z: 69). In this and the following lines in ms A and the partial duplicate CT 14 pl. 23 (see below), the sign Z\u00da is written for \"bite\" niku. This word is normally written Z\u00da.KUD 7'-11' The lines in ms A are partly duplicated in the traditional plant list format in CT 14 pl. 23 and STT 92. The plant lists contain the same elements and method of administering the drugs as ms A. Interestingly, ms A obv. 6'-13' do not con- tain the statement that the patient will recover, nor do such statements occur in the plant lists. This information supports that the entries in ms A were originally partly derived from a plant list. The row of entries is almost the same in all three manuscripts: CT 14 pl. 23 obv. 10 [\u00da MU x x] [The plant bar]raqtu : a plant (for) snakebite : drink (it) in first -quality beer. CT 14 pl. 23 obv. 6 [\u00da el-p]e-t\u00fa \u00da Z\u00da M[U : x x x x x x x x] The plant elpetu : a plant (for) snakebite: [bind (it in)] a im\u00fb- wad over the bite. pl. 23 obv. 7 [\u00da ur-b]a-t\u00fa \u00da Z\u00da [MU : x x x x x x x x]336 Appendix 2 The plant urbatu : a plant (for) snakebite : bind (it in) a im\u00fb- wad over the bite.

EM]E.UR.[GI] : \u00da Z\u00da MU [x x x x x x x x x x] [... \"Dog]'s tongue\" : a plant for the bite of snake and dog : make the man con- sume and drink (it). It is possible that STT 92 col. i 11 should be restored according to CT 14 pl. 23 obv. 11, see B\u00f6ck 2014a: 156. For the translation of the infinitives, see below. 8'-10' The verbal forms in these lines in ms A are marked as infinitives, but trans - lated as imperatives or precatives, bandage\". This form the infinitive is referred to as the \"heischenden Infinitiv\" by von Soden (1995: 252 \u00a7150*), and occurs instead of the \"Heischendes Pr\u00e4sens\" in some briefer recipes or pharmacological works (ibid.: 127, 252; see Aro 1961: 28-29 and note 1). As stated above, such forms in prescriptions seem to be rare, thereby stessing the relationship between the plant lists CT 14 pl. 23 as well as STT 92 and ms A. 8' The ingredient elpetu was likely a reed and E: 108-109) or \"cattail is also listed in Malku as nmu (Hra 2010: 62, 186), which is likely also a \"rush\" (CAD N/2: 235). The elpetu-reed could possibly be used to weave baskets, which fits the context of a \"wad\" (see CAD E: 109). Medically, the plant is not well attested. The plant seems to have caught fire easily and to have grown in places, which could be flooded (Scurlock 2018: 530, 532, 535). It is described in Uruanna as the \"bed of Itar\" and having a red top (ibid.: 351 and note 19, 534 and notes 29 and 31). Furthermore, it is possible that the plant was believed to dry up excess fluid (ibid.: 533). This prescription and the following two (ms A obv. 8'-10') make use of a so-called im\u00fb that is interpreted as a \"wad made of reeds, used against snake bite\" (CAD : 193-94). The majority of references therefore seem to originate from ms A and the plant list CT 14 pl. 23. According to the CAD (: 194), it is possible that the word refers to \"a specific form or arrangement in which certain sedge -like plants were used\" (see Thompson 1949: 10 note 3). 337 Edition of RA 15 pl. 76 According to this interpretation, the plant used must have been bound to form the \"wad\" , which is the favoured translation in CAD (U- W: 212b): \"to be bound in a wad over the bite\". 9' The urbatu CAD (U-W: 211-212). A related term may also refer to an illness or a certain urbatu- worm (see Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 82-83). Several plants are listed against this worm name \"papyrus\" in Uruanna (Rumor 2017: 24, 32 line 138). An incantation continuously referring to the \"red urbatu\" and \"red river/water\" may have been used for draining an abscess and after - wards bandaging a wound (Scurlock 2014: 441-443). In the case of a ven- omous snakebite, it is important to attempt to remove as much venom as possible. Therefore, references to an ingredient used in relation to draining unwanted fluids fits the context. The urbatu- worm is also listed in a series of maladies in a Gula healing incantation (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 108-109, 179 and note 78). Note that an urbatu-worm, possibly a tapeworm, is listed as a diagnosis in sev - eral prescriptions in the N4 manuscript BAM 159 col. ii 25-48 (see ibid.: 109; Scurlock 2014: 495-98). It is also in this manuscript that we later find the two prescriptions for horses in BAM 159 col. v 33-47 (see below), which mirrors the situation in ms A, in which horse prescriptions are found on the reverse. 10' The reading of PA-PA-a-nu appears to be the otherwise unknown ararinu- plant (CAD A/2: 232-33). In Uruanna's \"Dreckapotheke\" section, is referred to as \"dog saliva\" (Rumor 2017: 23, 31 line 133). This name may explain why this plant was listed immediately before the \"dog's tongue\"-plant in the following entry. The bed and the bedroom were places of privacy in which the patient was frequently located (e.g., Stol 1997: 408; van der Toorn 1996: 60-61). Therefore, the plant may have been used here to surround the bed in order to ensure that further evil could not befall the patient, but at the same time to treat the area in which the patient was located. Although the plant could be used medically, the CAD (A/2: 233) cites a use \"for conciliating one's god\" , which may partially explain the effect of the plant, namely to ensure a benign relationship with the divine power who possibly sent the snake that bit the patient. It is unclear how a im\u00fb- wad could be used to surround a bed. The other possible solution is to translate \"to wrap (up)\" (CAD L: 73), although this does not solve the problem. 11' The plant lin kalbi \"dog's tongue\" may be another name for the bunu- plant derived from ba u \"to smell 2014a: called \"bat's 338 Appendix 2 head\" , and it is also the name for the armdu-plant and in some instances the nikiptu-plant (Rumor 2017: 5, 9-10, 25 line 9, 27 line 38 and 42). ammu ikinu describes the plant as The plant was considered \"Gula's/Ninigizibara's dog\" and therefore directly connected to the healing goddess (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 167). It was widely applicable against many varied symptoms and illnesses (ibid.: 140-56, 174-75). The plant is listed in Uruanna as a plant against snakebite (ibid.: 156). In BAM 1, lin kalbi is listed numerous times and various parts of the plant are used. These parts can be used in a potion against, e.g., sulu- cough, au-phlegm or amurriqnu-jaundice (Attia and Buisson 2012: 27 col. ii 35, 28 col. ii 45+ col. ii 60+ col. iii 20, 29 col. iii 42). 12'-13' This is the only prescription that covers more than one line on the obverse of ms A. It includes plants used individually in several of the preceding lines in ms A obv. 12'-13' , except for one plant that does not seem to occur in the previous prescriptions, namely the partially reconstructed akir\u00fb-plant. The sign was copied by Scheil (1918: 75-76) as KA. The AKIR sign is close to KA, and this plant is listed in Uruanna as a plant against snakebite (ni-ik MU). Therefore, the reconstruction is plausible (see CAD /1: 168). The akir\u00fb-plant is unidentified, but may be related to \"henbane\" 514; see CMAwR 1: 472; CAD /1: 167-68). The name was also part of a plant called \u00faAKIR d\u00e1-ma that is equated with another unknown plant called pru-plant in Uruanna (CAD P: 420), and provided with name \"tongue of a tiqq\u00fb- ox\" (Rumor 2017: 13, 20 line 62). Perhaps accidentally, bull saliva was used against a scorpion sting in ms A obv. 17' (see below). Note also that the Sumerogram AKIR is listed as part of plant names in Uruanna, read as PA -PA-a-nu, which was used in ms A in obv. 10' (see STT 391 obv. 16-17). Various plants resembling the akir\u00fb-plant were listed as useful against horse colic (ks libbi), bennu- epilepsy , and makadu-illness A possible variant of horse colic was treated in ms A on the reverse (see below). The kurkn\u00fb-plant is unidentified (see CMAwR 2: 512; CMAwR 1: 471 with references). The plant could be used against, e.g., azu- and amurriqnu- jaundice (B\u00f6ck 2014a: 125 note 106), renal and rectal problems, and possibly also against makadu-illness (Geller of the latrine\" (Rumor 2017: 20, 30 line 108).339 Edition of RA 15 pl. 76 The writing u ina in ms A is peculiar and cannot be explained. It may be due to a mistake by Kiir -Aur , or the copy may be incorrect. I have chosen to emend the line and remove the {u}. It is unclear if E.ME in these lines and ms A obv. 14' and 18' denotes a variant of a G- stem or a Gtn- or D -stem of pau (see CAD P: 247-49). It is translated as a G- stem throughout this edition (ibid.: 247). 14' From this line in ms A until the text breaks, the focus shifts from snakebites to scorpion stings. There is an accompanying change in the preserved ingre - dients, among which the blood of certain reptiles and the saliva of a bull are used (see below). The urru (EME.DIR and EME.ID) is an see George 2016: 165; Freedman 2006a: 166 and note for line 1, 204 and note for line 1). Although lizards are attested in medicinal prescriptions, they are not frequently used (see George 2016: 167; Scurlock 2014: 407-8, 410-12, 2005: 40-41, 100-101; CAD : 255). They were considered ominous and appear in the 32nd tablet of umma lu (CAD : 254-55; see Freedman 2006: 164-189). The 33rd tablet of umma lu contains omens the pizallru- gecko (MU.GIM.GURUN . (Freedman consecu- tively as urru and pizallru are also observed in the first subseries of Sa- gig (Hee\u00dfel 2001-02: 32-33). The blood of the pizallru- gecko is also used in ms A obv. 18' , and the appearance of these ingredients together may have been influenced by the order expressed in the omen series. The reason for applying the blood of lizards and, later in ms A obv. 18' , of geckos to a scorpion sting may result from the gecko's, and perhaps also the lizard's, ability to kill certain scorpions and even tolerate their venom (Zlotkin et al. 2003). If this is true of the various species used in these prescriptions, it may have been believed that the blood of an animal that was capable of overcoming the venom and defeating the powerful and venomous scorpion provided the user with the same effect. An omen in umma lu refers to the ominous event of a gecko killing a snake in a man's house (Freedman 2006a: 208-209 line 75'). For The application of flour may relate to the application of dough onto scorpion stings elsewhere (see George 2016: 165 with further references). However, the reasoning behind applying flour may not have been exactly the same, as it is possible that flour was supposed to absorb fluid or blood from the wound and thereby symbolize the extraction of the venom. The imperative ki-sir!-ma likely stems from kesru \"to block, dam a river, make a pavement\" (CAD K: 313-314), although the only medical example 340 Appendix 2 quoted in the CAD relates to tampons in the nose. Similar use of the impera- tive in prescriptions is observed in, e.g., OB medical texts, see George 2016: 166. Another possibility would be to read ke-sir!-ma as a stative where the plu- ral Z\u00cc.ME is treated as a collective singular (\"flour blocks ...\"). It is difficult to account for another verb, such as karu. 16' The kamnu (GAMUN) is possibly a type of cumin (CAD K: 131-32 with refer - ences). It was considered to be a benign plant, and an entry in the 55th tablet of umma lu states: \"If ditto ((someone) grows) kamnu ditto (in a field), he will prevail over his adversary; he will be happy\" (Freedman 2017: 101 line 63' , 106). The ingredient called \"bat wing\" in Uruanna's \"Dreckapotheke\" section (Rumor 2017: 16, 29 line 84). A variant called \"kamnu of tamarisk\" is named \"gab\u00fb- stone \" (ibid.: 12, 28 line 53). Note that another term kamnu refers to a fungus, although it is referred to with a different Sumerogram (UZU .DIR; CAD K: 133; see SAA 13 no. 71). The entries in Uruanna spell the word phoneti- cally or use the Sumerogram \u00faGAMUN(sar). In the latter examples, the entries must refer to the plant. For this line, see also George 2016: 165. 17' Saliva (ruputu) appears to be frequently attested in connection to bulls/oxen (alpu) in various treatments (CAD R: 415; see also George 2016: 165). Although bull saliva may have had certain therapeutic qualities, a connection between thick bull saliva, semen and potency motifs in scorpion incantations (arai- incantations; see Cooper 1996) likely provide a conceptual overlap that explain the possible magical abilities of this substance. Furthermore, at least in humans, scorpion venom may cause excessive salivation (see Section 4.1.2). For bull saliva in connection to potency, see also Scurlock 2014: 548, 550. See also the OB manuscript BAM 393 obv. 19-20, which contains a related entry utilizing bull saliva against a scorpion sting. 18' The line does not appear to begin with KI.MIN , and probably should be restored as: [MU.D\u00cd]M.GURUN .NA for a pizallru- or pizallurtu-gecko (George 2016: 165; see Freedman 2006a: 204 note for line 1 with further refer - ences). It remains uncertain if this term refers to a coded plant (B\u00f6ck 2011: 697). It should be noted that ammu ikinu lists the lin kalbi \"Dog's tongue\"-plant, which is mentioned in other prescriptions in this text as a plant upon which the pizallru- gecko lies (CAD L: 209 with references; see also notes for line 11' above). For the possible reasoning behind applying the blood of a gecko, see the commentary to ms A obv. 14' above. The ingredient billatu (DIDA) seems to be a dry substance used in rela- tion to the preparation of (instant) beer and it can be crushed and eaten in medical texts (CAD B: 228; see CMAwR 2: 509 and CMAwR 1: 54, 469 with 341 Edition of RA 15 pl. 76 references). As there is no mention of a fluid into which the billatu can be mixed, the final sign should be read GU!. This differs slightly from the trans - lation by B\u00f6ck (2011: 697) of this line: \"If a scorpion has stung a man, cut the head of a pizallurtu- gecko and smear the blood on the wound, (the patient) should drink instant beer\". The line ends somewhat abruptly without the expected ina-e. 19' The signs in Scheil's copy can be grouped and read in numerous ways. There does not appear to be enough room to reconstruct [DI KI.MIN]. The line is difficult to make sense of, regardless how the signs are read. A reading IM.\u00da could designate imukku \"a clay cover\" (CAD I-J: 138-39). In at least one instance, a LB ritual for a dog bite rubs the wound with clay and fashions a dog from the clay afterwards (Finkel 1999: 219-221). The statement 7-\u00fa likely indicates an action repeated seven times. The sign after 7-\u00fa appears to be NU, BE, or PAB , although the interpretation remains uncertain. Presumably, the final signs spell out a verbal form that cannot be properly reconstructed. This verbal form may have been a precative (li-...). 20' The initial ingredient that is sieved (alu) cannot be properly read, but could be \u00fa!LAL! for aqullu (see CAD A/2: 452-53). The transliteration becomes highly uncertain after GETIN . The next signs look like lu x? lal and thereafter GAR -an ina-e. It is difficult to make sense of these signs in their current state, but it is possible the LU actually comprised Z\u00cc and a broken ME. The reading N\u00cdG.L\u00c1 GAR -an in ms A obv. 20' was established in the CAD (N/2: 49). The sentence was likely abbrevi- ated, but one would expect a preposition and another verbal form, such as ballu. Finally, we should expect GAR -an-ma ina-e. 21' George (2016: 165) notes this line among the entries in the text that adminis - ter the potion by mouth alone. 22'-24' The final prescriptions on the obverse of ms A, alongside ms A obv. 16' and 18' , are the only prescriptions on the obverse that employ more than one method of application (see George 2016: 165). 22' The final instruction after the patient is anointed (\u00c9 -ma) cannot be prop - erly read. The first sign may be G\u00da for \"neck\" (kidu). If this is correct, one would expect a pronominal suffix referring to the patient. However, this does not seem to be the case. 23' The first readable sign is MAR anoint\" or zak\u00fb -su \"you anoint him\" , it is questionable if the initial sign is MAR. I have emended the sign to a S\u00daD to accommodate a crushed ingredient drunk in beer and placed in oil for anointing the patient.342 Appendix 2 Reverse 4' This line ana into his left nostril\". A similar method of application with a spec- ified vessel is listed in ms A rev. 7'. The only parallels that use the specific \"left nostril\" , beside ms A rev. 7' below, are BAM 159 col. v 36: ina vari- ous plant (see Stol 2011: 400). As a result, the \"irrational\" left nostril was only used in prescriptions in relation to horses (387-99, 391-93, 400-402). Combined with the discussion by Stol (2011: 400-402) of the following pre - scription for an ill horse in ms A, the prescription in ms A rev. 0'-4' most likely also relates to a horse. As a result, the third person pronominal suffix has been translated \"it\" to reflect the horse. See Sections 3.5.2 and 4.4.3 for discussions of these lines. 5'-8' Treated in Stol ist es gut.\" Stol (2011: 387-92) also treated a comparable prescription found on BAM 159 col. v 33-36 (see Parys 2014: 23, 34-35, of ingredients), 8 plants for horse ks libbi (colic). You pour it into its left nostril in pressed wine and it will recover\". See also 93 obv. 35'-37'; BAM 309 col. 1'-4'. or \"drawn wine\" 159 col. v 14 pl. 41 Rm. lines 1'-5'; Stol 2011: 388, 393; Scurlock 2014: 498-99), but this does not appear to be the case in this prescription. The description that the ingredients are first \"pounded, crushed\" s\u00e2ku (S\u00daD) and thereafter \"crushed in\" a fluid alu (GAZ ) are also found in the second horse prescription in BAM 159 col. v (und) zusammen 499) \"you grind ... you crush (everything) with ...\". 7' The medicament is administered through a DUG ziriqi, possibly to be trans - lated as a \"stomach with references). (Z: 134) interprets it as a sort of pipette, von Soden as 257-58) translates it as \"...-R\u00f6hre \". 343 Edition of RA 15 pl. 76 The DUG designates it as a clay object comparable to various fluid contain- ers (ibid.: 401 and note 256). Stol stresses the uniqueness of the instrument, as this is the only example (cf. BAM 159 discussed in Parys 2014: 23 and B\u00f6ck 2009a: 117 and notes 56-57). This method for treating horse colic is also attested in the Ugaritic hippiatric texts (Cohen and Sivan 1983: 9-10, 16-17 with references) and the method is still applied today (e.g., Lopes et al. 2004: 696, 702). See the discussion in Sections 3.5.2 and 4.4.3. Similarly to the method of application in ms A rev. 4' , this mixture is administrated into the \"left nostril\" of the horse (see above). 8' This line is problematic and the copy is probably wrong. Scheil's copy se calmera\" (Scheil 1918: 77, 79). The GETIN KUR.RA CAD (K: 205) as \"mountain wine\" , a type of wine exclusively attested in this text. As a result, Stol (2011: 400-401 and note 251) argued convincingly via the parallel prescription in BAM 159 col. v 33-36 (see above) that this line was incorrectly copied and should read: ANE!.KUR.RA a ..., with the remaining sentence relating to the horse's illness being cured (SIG-iq) with the prescription. Stol proposed that the doubtful signs after a, which read BU I LU SU, could describe the illness afflicting the horse. The end of the sentence can therefore be read: a ... DAB -su SIG-iq, i.e., \"to make well that which has seized it (i.e., the horse)\". Stol (2011: 401 and note 254) suggested reading the signs bu-i as q\u00edd-i for a relatively unknown illness qidu (2011: 401 note 254) is s\u00edr-i for ir-i spelling the poorly attested illness iru \"Fieberglut\" from the aru 1104-5). This illness, however, is attested as an animal illness in a namburbi-ritual edited by Caplice (1970: 120 line 64; see also Stol 2011: 383), who translated iru as \"dirge\" , a well-attested similar word (CAD : 205-6) derived from another similar verb aru \"to a lamentation\" (see CAD : 99-100). Both mean- ings could fit the presumed colic-like state of the horse that this prescription aimed to cure. Some illnesses affecting the libbi \"stomach, abdomen, heart\" , and possibly also the illness ks libbi, were connected to depressed could potentially turn into mmtu (Scurlock and Andersen 2005: 508) and, by extension, the illness could produce fever. If the spelling here was supposed to designate iru, both verbs aru \"to heat\" and \"to sing a lamen- tation\" fit symptoms of this presumably colic-like illness.344 Appendix 2 9' The catch-line is difficult to read. Scheil (1918: 77, 79-80) read it as follows with modified readings of Sumerograms: DI NA (alt.: TAK , for la douleur soul\u00e8ve son cur ...\". The copy shows NA instead of NA (cf. Scheil 1918: 77, 80). As a result, it is possible that several signs in this line were incorrectly copied. Similar copying mistakes occur throughout Scheil's copy, e.g., in rev. 11' and several emendations are suggested here. The \u00f9 over u for a conjunction seems unusual in this context, and syntacti- cally we would expect E-ma instead of u. It is not impossible that \u00f9 marked an alternative to the first verbal form (von Soden 1995: 212 \u00a7117c) or maybe a disjunctive statement, although this would ordinarily be spelled l (ibid.: 258). This cannot be properly explained, and the sign cannot be emended to fit the context better at present. I translate \u00f9 as \"and\" , but the spelling may have had a different function. Scheil recognized that the catch-line was connected to the inners (\u00c0 ) ris- ing (E) (Scheil 1918: 77, 79). As the word \"stomach\" libbu (\u00c0) and the sign for \"to go up/go down\" el\u00fb/wardu (E) are mentioned twice in the catch-line, it is likely that it quotes a symptom description concerned with nausea. However, such diagnoses often use a verb related to vomiting, such as ar\u00fb (Scurlock and made in this catch-line. A number of signs in the line cannot be properly read without emendation. Scheil read RAT RAT over the emended \u00fa!-rad , and a-rik(?) as the final two signs. The first of the final signs is a, but the last sign is unclear. I have emended it to lam?. By emending RAT RAT to \u00fa!-rad and a-rik(?) to a-lam? it is possible to provide each instance of \u00c8 with its opposite meaning, i.e. \"if a man's! stomach rises (to vomit) and settles!, (and) his stomach (after having) settled rises(?) (again)\". This would provide a description of continuing states of nausea. However, this interpretation is not without problems. Verbal forms of el\u00fb with initial a- are only attested as imperatives and second person singular forms, and these mainly stem from OB examples (see CAD E: 116). As a result, the spelling can- not be explained here, but I fail to see other interpretations. The catch-line remains without duplicates or parallels. 10' According to Scheil's copy, the number reads 32?. However, the two wedges after 30 are written horizontally instead of vertically. Although this writing is attested, it does not occur on the few other examples of numbered nisus from Kiir -Aur (see Section 9.2.3). 11' Kiir -Aur 's name and a number of signs after the name cannot be read prop - erly on Scheil's copy. Scheil also failed to make proper sense of the line and transliterated pKi-ir (dingir) rab-gan-me DUMU a dPA ba-la-su. Hunger 345 Edition of RA 15 pl. 76 (1968: 70) transliterated the name as pKi-ir-dD\u00ccM.ME.TUR and emended the ending correctly as a dPA tuk-lat-su (BAK 200 ms E). The best transcription of the Sumerogram in the name appears to be Lamatu, although this reading makes little sense and the copy does not support Hunger's transliteration. I suggest emending most of the signs and reading: pKi-ir-AN .\u00c1R! l\u00fa\u00c1MAN!. L\u00c1! TUR a dPA tuk!-lat-su. This produces a regular spelling of Kiir -Aur 's name, and furthermore provides him with a title that most likely existed on the original tablet, although this cannot be checked. 14' The final phrase, N\u00cdG .GIG dE.NAGA , is only in colophon. However, colophons with N\u00cdG .GIG DN are attested (see Hunger 1968: 163 with references), albeit rarely with Nisaba. Ms A is quoted in CAD (I-J: 56) as: \"do not a sin against Nisaba\". Nisaba was originally a goddess of grain and writing, but lost importance after the OB period, although she continued to be connected to Nab\u00fb and to be referenced in the scribal arts (Michalowski 575, 578-79; see CAD N/2: 273). Due to Nisaba's role as a goddess of writing and her association with Nab\u00fb, she was presumably a learned substitute for Nab\u00fb. She was occasionally addressed in NA sources, e.g., in a compendium of uilla-prayers from the Nab\u00fb temple in Kalu (CTN 4 no. 168), a Sumerian mythical tale (Civil and Lambert 1983), and the Akkadian disputation-like poem known as \"Nisaba and other copyists (see Hunger 1968: 177-78 with examples). In the remaining signs copied by Scheil we should therefore expect a divine name, but at present this cannot be reconstructed. Alternatively, the line could be reconstructed in and Buisson 2012: 30 col. iv 31; Hunger 1968: 79 no. 234 line 6). This would, how - ever, ruin the current reading ni-il, which is most likely correct. None of the comparable examples listed by Hunger contain a preposition such as ina, and the alternative interpretation must be considered unlikely.Bibliography Abusch, T. 1974 \"Mesopotamian Anti- Witchcraft Literature: Texts and Studies Part I: The Nature of Maql\u00fb: a History and Understanding of Babylonian Witchcraft Beliefs and Literature (Ancient Magic and Divination 5; Leiden, , in: R.
