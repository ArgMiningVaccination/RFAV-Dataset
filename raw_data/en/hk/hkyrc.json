Mr. Speaker, as we begin the next session of the 106th Con-gress, we are going to engage in an-other heated discussion regarding nor-mal trade relations with China. In exchange for attaining member- ship in the World Trade Organization,China has made a number of commit- ments in regard to its trade policy.Among those commitments are im-proved market access, tariff reduc-tions, elimination of nontariff quotas,open service sectors and elimination ofexport subsidies. While many people are celebrating this alleged win for American busi-nesses, I come this morning to questionthe actual benefit for the United Statesof America. China is the fourth largestsupplier of U.S. imports and the thir-teenth largest buyer of U.S. exports. Inaddition, the U.S. trade deficit withChina has risen from $6.2 billion in 1989to $57 billion in 1998. Furthermore, China has a dismal record of complying with prior inter-national agreements, and I think thisis an important point. A blatant exam-ple concerns intellectual propertyrights. The United States Trade Representa- tive can specify under the 1974 TradeAct which countries are violators.They are the ``Special 301 Priority For-eign Countries,'' sort of a designationand those countries that violate U.S.intellectual property rights are so des-ignated. So let us look at the list whenit comes to China. In 1991, China was named a Special 301 violator for intellectual propertyrights. They sat down with them. Theyreached an agreement a year later andChina said: We will agree to strengthenour intellectual property laws and im-prove protection for U.S. products inour country. But did they? In 1994, the United States Trade Rep- resentative again identified China as aviolator. At this time, many factoriesin China were pirating compact diskswhile China trade laws restricted U.S.market access. So an agreement wasreached a year later again with Chinato stem this piracy and enforce the in-tellectual property rules. But again in 1996, another year later, the USTR, the United States TradeRepresentative, designated China as a violator again for not complying. Andonly when they were threatened with a$2 billion sanction did China begin tocomply. So China has shown an ability to ex- ploit loopholes in agreements regard-ing the transfer of military technology.In 1992, China agreed to abide by therules of the Missile Technology ControlRegime and then turned and sold bal-listic missile components to Pakistan.Though no technical violation wasmade, the transfer, of course, was con-trary to the spirit of the agreement.China has also aided Pakistan, Iran,and Algeria in the area of nuclear tech-nology and equipment. Another area of uneasiness is that China has made no attempt to concealits aggressiveness dealing with mili-tary modernization. In addition toarms purchases, such as the Russianbuilt SU\u00b127 fighter, which holds nearparity with our F\u00b115 fighter, China hasbegun construction of two short-rangemissile bases which now can threaten Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, we also need not forget the enormous damage called by China'sespionage activities resulting in thetheft of U.S. thermonuclear design in-formation. The Cox report concludedthat elements of this stolen informa-tion would help China in building itsnext generation of mobile ICBMs. Infact, the Washington Times reportedon December 6 last year that China isworking on a new strategic missile sub-marine containing smaller nuclearwarheads similar to American weap-ons. Upon completion, China will havethe ability to strike U.S. forces any-where it chooses. Mr. Speaker, I think the evidence is clear: this country is aggressively ex-panding its military complex, while atthe same time blatantly disregardinginternational agreements and exploit-ing loopholes in others. China has a history of torturing some of its religious leaders and arresting VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:35 Feb January 31, 2000 peaceful opposition demonstrators. China has stolen U.S. nuclear secretsand attempted to influence the U.S. po-litical process through what I believeto be illegal campaign contributions. Mr. Speaker, these are just a few il- lustrations I've outlined in the brief 5minutes that I have here. There is alonger list of China's predatory tactics.Do we have assurance that China willkeep its words the next time. I doubtit. I bring this to the attention of my colleagues now so that when we havethe heated discussion regarding thenormalization of trade relations withChina they will remember. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SHOULD SERIOUSLY ADDRESSNATIONAL DEBT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 19, 1999, the gentleman fromMichigan (Mr. S MITH) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 min-utes. Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Speak- er, all the Presidential Republican can-didates and Democrats are cam-paigning today for the Nation's firstelections tomorrow. I would like totalk, Mr. Speaker, about what is hap-pening with our national debt. Thepublic debt of the United States thattechnically every citizen now or ourkids and our grandkids eventually aregoing to have to pay off. Mr. Speaker, I hope every one of those candidates realizes that this talkabout paying down the public debt issomewhat of an untruthful presen-tation of what is happening with thepublic debt of this country. The way we do our bookkeeping here in Washington is sometimes confusingand unquestionably very complicated.But what we have right now is a publicdebt, as defined in law of $5.72 trillion,$5.72 trillion, approaching $6 trillion. We made some good decisions this past year to not spend any of the So-cial Security surplus for other govern-ment spending. Excellent start. Excel-lent beginning. But still, our total na-tional debt continues to increase. Whyis the total debt of this country con-tinuing to increase as we brag, and that is Republicans, Democrats, thePresident, brag that we are balancingthe budget and paying down the Fed-eral debt? Here is why. We have about 112 trust funds. The largest, of course, is the Social Secu-rity Trust Fund. But we are borrowingfrom all of these other trust funds also.The Civil Service Retirement TrustFund, the Highway Trust Fund, theAirport Trust Fund, the MedicareTrust Fund. From all of these trustfunds we are taking the extra money,because we have charged additionaltaxes more and above what is needed inany particular one year of spending.Now, we are using that money for othergovernment spending. I am introducing legislation that says let us lower the total debt subjectto the debt limit that Congress has to pass and the President has to sign. Letus lower that debt to where it will beat the end of this fiscal year next Octo-ber 1, and then let us stick to it. Let usmake sure that we have the kind offreeze that is going to take the burdenoff of our kids and our grandkids sothat they are not going to end up hav-ing to pay for what we consider is veryimportant spending this year. Mr. Speaker, I am a senior member of the Committee on the Budget. Thisweek we are holding what are calledlistening sessions, talking about whatthe Members are willing to do in termsof holding the line on spending. I am a very strong advocate, and I will encourage at our meetings tomor-row, this week and next week, that wehave spending caps for the kind ofspending discipline that it allows us. We have come a long ways. When I first came to Congress in 1993, the pro-jected deficit, in addition to what wewere borrowing from Social Security,was over $200 billion a year. Now, atleast, we have balanced the budget interms of Social Security spending, andthat is the largest amount. There willbe approximately $120 billion or $130billion more money coming in from So-cial Security taxes than we need in anyone year, so somehow we should bestarting to talk about how do we re-duce that burden on working men andwomen of America; and how do we saveSocial Security in the long run? It is a huge challenge. We talk about millions and billions and trillions. But,Mr. Speaker, if anybody can conceivewhat a trillion dollars is, let me justgive what is going to be required to payout Social Security benefits over thenext 75 years over and above what weare going to collect in Social Securitytaxes. Over and above what we are going to collect in Social Security taxes overthe next 75 years, it is going to take$120 trillion more money. That has gotto either come from increased bor-rowing, increased taxes, because I sus-pect the way we have been going inCongress it is not going to be comingfrom reduced spending in other areas.There are huge challenges before us. Mr. Speaker, I am a farmer. What we do on the farm is we try to pay off thefarm so that our kids do not have topay off that mortgage. In this country we are continuing to increase the debtto give a bigger mortgage to our kidsand our grandkids. Let us turn thataround. Let us have the presidentialcandidates start talking about the seri-ousness of saving Medicare and savingSocial Security and paying down thishuge public debt that is facing thiscountry. RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 12 of rule I, the Chair de-clares the House in recess until 2 p.m. Accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 42 minutes p.m.), the House stood in re-cess until 2 p.m.AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order at 2 p.m. PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend James David Ford, D.D., offered the followingprayer: Our hearts and hopes and prayers are with all those who face any uncer-tainty for the day or who must meetthe predicaments that each day pre-sents. Where there is this uncertainty,we pray, O gracious God, that Youwould grant faith and trust; wherethere are the dilemmas of decisions orthe compromises that shade our views,we pray for wisdom.

Will the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. G IBBONS ) come for- ward and lead the House in the Pledgeof Allegiance. Mr. GIBBONS led the Pledge of Alle- giance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God,indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. MUCH WORK LIES AHEAD (Mr. GIBBONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, today we face a new century in America and, aswe begin the second session of the 106thCongress, much work lies ahead of us.Over the last few weeks I had the op-portunity to tour my great State andmeet many of the citizens of the Stateof Nevada, and during these meetingsmy constituents expressed what theyexpect from and need from their Fed-eral Government. They want a federal commitment to empower local communities to makedecisions on school construction andmodernization projects, not the Fed-eral Government. They want a healthcare package which assures access tomedically necessary treatments whilenot eroding the quality of our healthcare system. They want a real tax cutfor hard working Americans that in-cludes the elimination of the marriagepenalty tax and the death tax, but VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:35 January 31, 2000 these are only a few of the concerns which we will need to address this ses-sion. Mr. Speaker, I am confident that we will rise to the challenge and pass re-sponsible legislation which will meetthe very needs of not just Nevadans butall Americans. So let us do as my friend Mills Lane says: let us get it on. THE TORTURE IN SIERRA LEONE MUST STOP (Mr. WOLF asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak about what has happened inthe African country of Sierra Leone.The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. H ALL) and I visited Sierra Leone this past De-cember. We were horrified at the atroc-ities that we saw; men and women withtheir arms and legs and ears cut off.Throughout Sierra Leone, rebel groupshave tortured and killed and maimedthousands to gain control of the coun-try's diamond industry, and theserebels have committed unbelievableacts that are hard to even look at. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. H ALL) has introduced legislation to stop thetrafficking of conflict diamonds thathave fueled so much of the death anddestruction. H.R. 3188 will require that all dia- monds bought and sold in the U.S. beidentified as to their country of origin. I believe that the bill of the gen- tleman from Ohio (Mr. H ALL) will help end the maiming and the killing in Si-erra Leone, and I urge all Members toplease call the office of the gentlemanfrom Ohio (Mr. H ALL) and cosponsor this bill so we can bring an end to themaiming and cutting off of legs andarms and the killing of people.

Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B OEHNER ) has explained, the House originally proposed the printingof four documents about our govern-ment, all of which Members and theirconstituents find extraordinarily use-ful. By its amendment, the Senate has proposed the printing of two additionaldocuments. I believe those documentsare appropriately added, and I cer-tainly urge Members to support thisresolution.

PERMITTING USE OF CAPITOL RO- TUNDA FOR CEREMONY COM-MEMORATING VICTIMS OF HOLO-CAUST Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to theconcurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 244) permitting the use of the Rotunda ofthe Capitol for a ceremony as part ofthe commemoration of the days of re-membrance of victims of the Holo-caust. The Clerk read as follows: H. C ON. RES. 244 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the rotunda of the Capitol is authorized to be used on May 4,2000, for a ceremony as part of the com-memoration of the days of remembrance ofvictims of the Holocaust. Physical prepara-tions for the ceremony shall be carried outin accordance with such conditions as theArchitect of the Capitol may prescribe. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the gentleman fromOhio (Mr. B OEHNER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. H OYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B OEHNER ). Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this resolution author- izes the use of the Rotunda of the Cap-itol for the Holocaust Days of Remem-brance ceremony. This ceremony willbe on May 4, 2000. The statute creating the U.S. Holo- caust Memorial Council directs thatthe council shall provide for appro-priate ways for the Nation to com-memorate the Days of Remembrance asan annual, national, civic commemora-tion of the Holocaust, and shall encour-age and sponsor appropriate observ-ances of such Days of Remembrancethroughout the United States. The purpose of the Days of Remem- brance is to ask citizens to reflect onthe Holocaust, to remember the vic-tims, and to strengthen our sense of de-mocracy and human rights. The event in the Rotunda of the Cap- itol is the centerpiece of similar Holo-caust remembrance ceremonies thattake place throughout the UnitedStates. The first Days of Remembrance cere- monies in the Rotunda occurred in 1979and has been an annual event exceptduring the period when the Rotundawas undergoing repairs. The theme of this year's commemo- ration is, and I will quote, ``The Holo-caust and the New Century: The Imper-ative to Remember.'' I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am once again pleased to cosponsor this resolution with thegentleman from California (Mr. T HOM- AS), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BOEHNER ), and others. This resolution, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B OEHNER ) has pointed out, provides for the annual commemo-ration of the Holocaust on May 4 ofthis year. Mr. Speaker, there is no occasion more important for the internationalcommunity and for humanity than to remember the tragedy that occurred inthe 1930s and 1940s, the massive loss oflife and the reality of man's inhu-manity to man. It is appropriate, I be-lieve, that we use the Rotunda, the lo-cation of so many historic events,again to draw attention and focus onone of the greatest tragedies in humanhistory. It reminds us, Mr. Speaker, that such events must never again be permittedto occur and that only through our vig-ilance will that be ensured. The ceremony will be a part of the annual Days of Remembrance spon-sored by the United States HolocaustMemorial Council. It is intended to en-courage citizens to reflect on the Holo-caust, to remember its victims and tostrengthen our sense of democracy andhuman rights. Mr. Speaker, I would observe that it is particularly important that suc-ceeding generations who have largelygrown up in a relatively peaceful worldbe called upon to remember this event.We have seen all too recently eventssimilar in character, if not in scope, aswe saw in Kosovo and in Bosnia. Thegentleman from Virginia (Mr. W OLF) just mentioned Africa. The Holocaustis an event, a time in history, that weought to remember so that successorgenerations never repeat it. The theme of this year's Days of Re- membrance is ``The Holocaust and theNew Century: The Imperative to Re-member.'' Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and urge its adop-tion. Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen- tleman for yielding. I want to commend thegentleman from California (Mr. T HOMAS) for bringing this measure to the floor at this time. The commemoration of the Holocaust is so important, and the fact that we do it here inthe Capitol Building, in the Rotunda, is an ex-tremely important reminder to the entire worldof the importance that we place on the Holo-caust. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to support the House Concurrent Resolution, H.Con. Res. 244, authorizing the use of theCapitol Rotunda for a ceremony commemo-rating the victims of the Holocaust. That important ceremony is scheduled to take place in the Capitol on April 13, 2000,from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. The passage of this resolution and the sub- sequent ceremony of the Days of Remem-brance will provide the centerpiece of similarHolocaust remembrance ceremonies that takeplace throughout our Nation. This day of remembrance will be a day of speeches, reading and musical presentation,and will provide the American people andthose throughout the world an important dayto study and to remember those who sufferedand those who survived. Mr. Speaker, it is important that we keep the memory of the Holocaust alive as part of ourliving history. As Americans, we can be proudof our efforts to liberate those who sufferedand survived in the oppressive Nazi con-centration camps. Let us never forget theharm that prejudice, oppression and hatredcan cause. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 31, 2000 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentlemanfrom Maryland (Mr. H OYER ), for his support, and I yield back the balance ofmy time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered bythe gentleman from Ohio (Mr.B OEHNER ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent reso-lution, H. Con. Res. 244. The question was taken.Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 8 of rule XX and theChair's prior announcement, furtherproceedings on this motion will bepostponed. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Membersmay have 5 legislative days withinwhich to revise and extend their re-marks and include extraneous materialon the subject of the concurrent resolu-tion just considered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Ohio? There was no objection. PERMITTING OFFICIAL PHOTO- GRAPHS OF HOUSE WHILE INSESSION Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to theresolution (H. Res. 407) permitting offi-cial photographs of the House of Rep-resentatives to be taken while theHouse is in actual session. The Clerk read as follows: H. R ES. 407 Resolved, That at a time designated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, of-ficial photographs of the House may betaken while the House is in actual session.Payment for the costs associated with tak-ing, preparing, and distributing such photo-graphs may be made from the applicable ac-counts of the House of Representatives. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the gentleman fromOhio (Mr. B OEHNER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. H OYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B OEHNER ). 1415 Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this resolution is very straightforward and simply authorizesthe use of the Chamber for a photowhile we are in session. The Speakerwould set the date for such photo andpayment as authorized from the appli-cable accounts of the House. As Members know, in the last session of Congress there was a photo taken ofall of the Members of the House, some-thing that was rather routine in ses- sions past, but over a period of 3 or 4sessions it did not occur. Several yearsago when this was done the Memberswere very supportive of the effort, andthe Committee on House Administra-tion voted for it. The Members thereofhave suggested that the House take an-other photograph in this session. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my staff behind me has suggested that Members should not for-get to smile. I think it is appropriatethat we take a picture of the House ofRepresentatives and its Members on anannual basis, or at least once duringevery Congress. I think this is not onlya substantial memento for those whohave the great honor and privilege ofserving here, but as well, an historicalrecord of those who are here, and ofcourse I rise in strong support of theresolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P ETRI). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio(Mr. B OEHNER ) that is House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution,H. Res. 407. The question was taken; and (two- thirds having voted in favor thereof),the rules were suspended and the reso-lution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. HILLORY J. FARIAS AND SAMANTHA REID DATE-RAPEDRUG PROHIBITION ACT OF 1999 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in theSenate amendments to the bill (H.R.2130) to amend the Controlled Sub-stances Act to add gamma hydroxy-butyric acid and ketamine to theschedules of controlled substances, toprovide for a national awareness cam-paign, and for other purposes. The Clerk read as follows: Senate amendments: Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape DrugProhibition Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (also called G, Liquid X, Liquid Ecstasy, Grievous BodilyHarm, Georgia Home Boy, Scoop) has become asignificant and growing problem in law enforce-ment. At least 20 States have scheduled suchdrug in their drug laws and law enforcement of-ficials have been experiencing an increased pres-ence of the drug in driving under the influence,sexual assault, and overdose cases especially atnight clubs and parties. (2) A behavioral depressant and a hypnotic, gamma hydroxybutyric acid (``GHB'') is beingused in conjunction with alcohol and otherdrugs with detrimental effects in an increasingnumber of cases. It is difficult to isolate the im- pact of such drug's ingestion since it is so typi-cally taken with an ever-changing array ofother drugs and especially alcohol whichpotentiates its impact. (3) GHB takes the same path as alcohol, proc- esses via alcohol dehydrogenase, and its symp-toms at high levels of intake and as impactbuilds are comparable to alcohol ingestion/in-toxication. Thus, aggression and violence can beexpected in some individuals who use such drug. (4) If taken for human consumption, common industrial chemicals such as gamma butyro-lactone and 1.4-butanediol are swiftly convertedby the body into GHB. Illicit use of these andother GHB analogues and precursor chemicals isa significant and growing law enforcementproblem. (5) A human pharmaceutical formulation of gamma hydroxybutyric acid is being developedas a treatment for cataplexy, a serious and de-bilitating disease. Cataplexy, which causes sud-den and total loss of muscle control, affectsabout 65 percent of the estimated 180,000 Ameri-cans with narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. Peoplewith cataplexy often are unable to work, drivea car, hold their children or live a normal life. (6) Abuse of illicit GHB is an imminent hazard to public safety that requires immediate regu-latory action under the Controlled SubstancesAct (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.). SEC. 3. EMERGENCY SCHEDULING GAMMA HY- DROXYBUTYRIC ACID AND LISTINGOF GAMMA BUTYROLACTONE ASLIST I CHEMICAL. (a) E MERGENCY SCHEDULING OF GHB.\u00d0 (1) I N GENERAL .\u00d0The Congress finds that the abuse of illicit gamma hydroxybutyric acid is animminent hazard to the public safety. Accord-ingly, the Attorney General, notwithstandingsections 201(a), 201(b), 201(c), and 202 of theControlled Substances Act, shall issue, not laterthan 60 days after the date of the enactment ofthis Act, a final order that schedules such drug(together with its salts, isomers, and salts of iso-mers) in the same schedule under section 202(c)of the Controlled Substances Act as would applyto a scheduling of a substance by the AttorneyGeneral under section 201(h)(1) of such Act (re-lating to imminent hazards to the public safety),except as follows: (A) For purposes of any requirements that re- late to the physical security of registered manu-facturers and registered distributors, the finalorder shall treat such drug, when the drug ismanufactured, distributed, or possessed in ac-cordance with an exemption under section 505(i)of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(whether the exemption involved is authorizedbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment ofthis Act), as being in the same schedule as thatrecommended by the Secretary of Health andHuman Services for the drug when the drug isthe subject of an authorized investigational newdrug application (relating to such section505(i)). The recommendation referred to in thepreceding sentence is contained in the firstparagraph of the letter transmitted on May 19,1999, by such Secretary (acting through the As-sistant Secretary for Health) to the AttorneyGeneral (acting through the Deputy Adminis-trator of the Drug Enforcement Administration),which letter was in response to the letter trans-mitted by the Attorney General (acting throughsuch Deputy Administrator) on September 16,1997. In publishing the final order in the Fed-eral Register, the Attorney General shall publisha copy of the letter that was transmitted by theSecretary of Health and Human Services. (B) In the case of gamma hydroxybutyric acid that is contained in a drug product for whichan application is approved under section 505 ofthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(whether the application involved is approvedbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment ofthis Act), the final order shall schedule suchdrug in the same schedule as that recommendedby the Secretary of Health and Human Services VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:05 Feb January 31, 2000 for authorized formulations of the drug. The recommendation referred to in the precedingsentence is contained in the last sentence of thefourth paragraph of the letter referred to in sub-paragraph (A) with respect to May 19, 1999. (2) F AILURE TO ISSUE ORDER .\u00d0If the final order is not issued within the period specified inparagraph (1), gamma hydroxybutyric acid (to-gether with its salts, isomers, and salts of iso-mers) is deemed to be scheduled under section202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act in ac-cordance with the policies described in para-graph (1), as if the Attorney General had issueda final order in accordance with such para-graph.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the gentleman fromMichigan (Mr. U PTON ) and the gentle- woman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U PTON ). GENERAL LEAVE Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan- imous consent that all Members mayhave 5 legislative days within which torevise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous matter on this legis-lation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection.Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in supporting thepassage of H.R. 2130, the Hillory J.Farias and Samantha Reid Date-RapeDrug Prohibition Act. As you may recall, the House ini- tially approved this legislation last Oc-tober on a vote of 423 to 1. This eveningwe will vote on this legislation asamended by the Senate, and if the leg-islation is approved, it will go straightto the President to be signed into law. The legislation we are considering today will amend the Controlled Sub-stances Act to put GHB, a dangerousand sometimes fatal drug used to fa-cilitate sexual assaults, in schedule 1 ofthe Controlled Substances Act, themost tightly regulated category ofdrugs with the strongest penalties formisuse. It will also clamp tight controls on GBL, a precursor to GHB that is itselfbeing used to facilitate sexual assaults. This legislation is desperately need- ed. The abuse, trafficking, and diver-sion of GHB is rapidly increasing. TheDrug Enforcement Administration hasdocumented nearly 6,000 encounters ofGHB. Deaths from the drug are esca-lating rapidly, from one in 1990 to 17last year, for a total of 58 deaths.Emergency room episodes resultingfrom the use of the drug are also esca-lating rapidly, from 20 in 1992 to 762 in1997, the last year for which data isavailable, for a total of more than 1,600episodes. Sadly, these numbers are reflecting only the tip of an iceberg. GHB is dif-ficult to detect, almost impossible, inthe body, within a few hours of itsbeing ingested. Many law enforcementofficers and emergency room personnelare not trained to look for it. As an example, I heard from one source in Kansas City that they sus-pected thousands of date rape and drugabuse cases in the greater Kansas Cityregion since 1993. The legislation beforeus was sparked by the death of twoyoung, wonderful women, one in Texasand one in Michigan, whose drinkswere spiked with GHB. Since then, fivemore women have died in Texas andanother two in Michigan. We must actnow before this tragic toll rises anyfurther. The FDA has issued consumer warn- ings about products containing GBL,which converts to GHB, when ingestedin dietary supplements, and has askedcompanies marketing products con-taining GBL to recall them. In August of last year the FDA sent a message to help professionals acrossthe country, asking them to report ad-verse events associated with the con-sumption of these products. Since then,the agency has received 122 reports ofserious adverse reactions, such as dan-gerously low respiration rates whichmay require intubation, unconscious-ness, coma, seizures, irregular heart-beat, and yes, death. Just this last month, as you may have read, Phoenix Suns player TomGugliotta suffered a seizure thatcaused him to stop breathing after tak- ing an over-the-counter herbal supple-ment containing GBL. Similarly, a 16-year-old Peoria, Illinois high schoolstudent collapsed during a school gymclass after taking a product containingGBL. He lost consciousness, stoppedbreathing, and had to be resuscitatedby paramedics. The Senate amended H.R. 2130 to fur- ther develop and strengthen the De-partment of Justice's focus on GHBand to provide for the development offorensic field tests for the detection ofthis substance. In all other respects,the Senate amendments have had thesame effect as the legislation that wepassed here in the House in October. I wish to express my appreciation for the help of so many of my colleagues,the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.S TUPAK ), the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON LEE), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B ILIRAKIS ), and the gen- tleman from Virginia (Chairman B LI- LEY), the help that they have given in getting us to this point, and for theleadership of the Senate, particularlySenator A BRAHAM and Senator H ATCH , in steering this legislation for Senateapproval. This has been a bipartisan ef-fort from day number one. With all my heart, as the father of a daughter and son, I ask that the Houseapprove this legislation tonight andsend it to the President. Let us do thisfor all of our sons and daughters, whoare at grave risk so long as these sub-stances are so readily available. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as Imay consume. Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the Committee on the Judiciary, the Sub-committee on Crime, I am delighted tojoin my colleague, the gentleman fromMichigan (Mr. U PTON ), a member of the Committee on Commerce, and thankhim for his leadership. In fact, his leadership was so strong that he was making sure that as I camein and landed at Reagan National, thatI would hurry on, and I got here time-ly. I thank him very much for that. This has been a very long journey, and the one thing that we can applaud,Mr. Speaker, is that we have workedtogether, the Committee on Commerce,the Committee on the Judiciary, andwe have answered the call of so manyvictims, now I am told almost between40 to 50 who have died. There was an anecdotal story of a Texas young woman who begged forhelp, explaining that her whole bodyhurt so much that the only way to stopit is to take more GHB but she wanteddesperately to quit. She had actuallydied two times on GHB and wasbrought back by paramedics. She wasraped while on GHB. She had not re-ported it because she felt it was herfault for getting high. I am gratified that Members of the Committee on Commerce, the gentle-men from Michigan, Mr. U PTON and Mr. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 the gentleman from Vir- ginia (Mr. B LILEY ) and I introduced this bipartisan bill, the Hillory J.Farias Samantha Reid Date Rape Pre-vention Act of 1999. Mr. Speaker, I am also grateful to the ranking member, the gentlemanfrom Michigan (Mr. D INGELL ), the gen- tleman from Ohio (Mr. B ROWN ), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B ILI- RAKIS ); members of my committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M CCOL- LUM), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H YDE), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. C ONYERS ). This was a bi- partisan effort. I am looking forward for this bill to be supported by my colleagues, and, aswell, to go quickly to the desk of thePresident of the United States. This is a victory for those of us who are concerned about date rape drugs.This drug, GHB, has been used in innu-merable rapes around the country andhas been implicated, as I have said, inat least 40 to 50 deaths. In addition todate rape, this drug is very popular onthe party scene in many cities, and itis widely abused. I was prompted to act to control the illicit use of GHB 3 years ago becauseof the death of Hillory J. Farias ofLaPorte, Texas, on August 5, 1996. Ourcommunity was dumbfounded, baffled.I introduced a GHB bill in 1997, andhave continued to advocate for its pas-sage to prevent more women frombeing victimized by date rape drugs. Hillory Farias was a 17-year-old high school senior, a model student and var-sity volleyball player who died as a re-sult of GHB being slipped into her softdrink. She was not a drug user. Hillory and two other girlfriends went out to a club where they con-sumed only soft drinks. At some pointduring the evening GHB was slippedinto Hillory's drink. Soon afterwardsshe complained of feeling sick with asevere headache. She went home tobed, but the next morning Hillory wasfound by her grandmother unconsciousand unresponsive. She was rushed tothe hospital where she later died, neverresuming consciousness. Unfortunately, Hillory's death was not the only tragedy of this drug. Myoffice has been contacted by the fami-lies of several victims of the drug sinceMarch of last year. In January, 1999, 15-year old Samantha, a young lady fromMichigan, died as a result of this drugbeing put in her soda while out withfriends. Another 14-year-old girl wasalso poisoned with GHB and went intoa coma. Four young men will go ontrial for Samantha's murder this year.On January 2, Samantha would havebeen 16 years old. Her death prompted other Members from the Michigan delegation to be-come interested in this issue, and thusthis legislation is named for both ofthese young women whose lives werecut short by this drug. There is also an-other incident in Michigan where 14teenagers at a party ingested GHB andlapsed into comas during the Fourth of July holiday last year. In addition to the tragic stories of Hillory and Samantha, my office wascontacted by the office of the gen-tleman from New York (Mr. L AFALCE ) with the story of Kerri Breton fromSyracuse, New York, who also diedfrom this drug being slipped into herdrink. Ms. Breton was away on a busi-ness trip and was having a drink in ahotel bar with a colleague. She wasfound next day dead on the bathroomfloor of her hotel room. Her stepfathershared this painful story in the hope itwould alert others to the dangers ofthis drug. Mr. Speaker, this drug is not a re- specter of any age. You do not have tobe very smart, you do not have to beunsmart, if you will; you do not haveto be educated or uneducated; you donot have to be rich or poor. This is adrug that respects no one and causesthe loss of life of wonderful humanbeings. A young man from the Chicago area overdosed and almost died last Sep-tember. He was using the drug becausehe wanted to be a bodybuilder. Just re-cently I received more informationabout young people who are addicted tothis drug. In Texas there is a youngwoman who was addicted to GHB andclinically died twice. In addition, these tragedies under- score the importance of this legisla-tion. All of these incidents amongyoung people are stronger evidencethat this drug has a high potential forabuse and must be placed on the sched-ule for the Controlled Substances Act. A few months ago during the summer there was a rave party in California upin the mountains. Those who attendedwere alleged to have taken GHB, as hasbeen noted by these rave parties thathave gone on. A car loaded with youngpeople went over the side of the moun-tain. Of course, they lost their livesleaving the rave party. Without this bill, illicit use of GHB would increase dramatically. There areundoubtedly other deaths that may nothave been classified as GHB-related be-cause the drug is not part of the stand-ard toxicology screen. That is why weare very grateful for this bill, that in-cludes part of the responsibilities ofFDA and the Justice Department, sothat we will have those kinds of toolsfor law enforcement to utilize. In addition, GHB has been used to render victims helpless to defendagainst an attack, and it even erasesany memory of the attack. That is whyit has been so difficult to prove rape. As a drug of abuse, GHB is ingested orally after being mixed in a liquid.The onset of action is rapid and uncon-sciousness can occur in as little as 15minutes. Profound coma can occurwithin 30 to 40 minutes after ingestion.GHB has also been used by drug abus-ers for its alleged hallucinogenic ef-fects, and by bodybuilders. I believe by classifying this drug now, we send a strong message to thosewho would use this drug and its analogs to commit crimes againstwomen and others. In addition to beingused for date rape, this drug is beingused at alarming rates among youngpeople. However, my position does not mean I am insensitive to the concerns of pa-tients who might be helped by thisdrug. This drug has shown some bene-fits to patients with a specific form ofnarcolepsy in clinical trials, those whosuffer from sleeping sickness, and forthose uses during trials to try to curethat disease. 1430 There is a possibility that GHB can be used for the treatment of such dis-eases. We want that to occur, becauseit is a rare disorder. We believe thatthis bill matches the medicinal needsalong with the needs to protect ourcitizens from the devastation of illegaluse of GHB, known to be made in bath-tubs in large amounts. The distribution of this drug would be strictly controlled to ensure thatonly patients in need of this drugwould have access. This bill also pro-vides for a grant by the Department ofJustice to research a forensic test toassist law enforcement in detectingGHB on the street, one of our majorproblems in making the cases. Thiswould improve the ability to prosecutedate rape and other crimes involvingthis substance. Mr. Speaker, this bill reaches a com- promise; and I am glad. And as I statedearlier, we have been working a longtime to pass this bill and to schedulethis drug, because I do not want to seeany more lives cut short by GHB. I thank all the people who were in- volved in this. One of my sources forinformation was Trinka Porrata, a re-tired member of the Los Angeles PoliceDepartment. She has been a steadyvoice explaining to all of us that GHBis dangerous and can be devastatingand causes the loss of lives. I thankTrinka for working with my staff forthe past 3 years and coming to Wash-ington, D.C. to testify twice in thisjourney that we have made. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the Farias family, her unclesand grandparents, for sharing theirstory to help us inform others aboutthis drug. They did not need to comeforward, but they did. I thank them fortheir courage. I thank as well, Harris County Med- ical Examiner, Dr. Joy Carter, who wasthe one who discovered what was thecause of, of course, Hillary's death.And I would like to thank SamanthaReid's mother for support of our ef-forts. Of course, I want to take note of the Senate's leadership as well; the fami-lies of other victims who have sharedthis devastation; and my colleagues,the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.U PTON ), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. D INGELL ), Senator VerDate 27-JAN-2000 January 31, 2000 ABRAHAM and the other members of the Michigan delegation, and the gentle-woman from Michigan (Ms. S TABENOW ) for showing interest in this issue aswell. I would like to take time to thank the staff members of the Committee onCommerce for their hard work, espe-cially John Ford with the minoritystaff and John Manthei with the major-ity staff. I would also like to thankMembers of the Committee on the Ju-diciary for their work on this issue lastyear and this year, as I mentioned thegentleman from Virginia (Mr. S COTT), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.C ONYERS ), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M CCOLLUM ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman H YDE). In 1998, we had a hearing on this issue in theSubcommittee on Crime and it shed alot of light on date rape and the illicituse of GHB. Often, they say that our two commit- tees find it difficult to find com-promise. I am very pleased to standhere today and acknowledge that theyhave. I also thank the staff memberswho worked on this as well in my of-fice, Deena Maerowitz, Ayanna Haw-kins, and Leon Buck. Finally, I thankall of those who are victims but yetstill living. And let me promise theyoung people and others of the futurethat with the passage of this GHB leg-islation, we look to save more lives andI ask the President to sign this bill asquickly as possible. I am pleased to stand here today in strong support of the Hillory J. Farias and SamanthaReid Date Rape Prevention Act of 1999. Lastsummer, I joined my Colleagues on the Com-merce Committee, Representatives U PTON, STUPAK, and B LILEY, to introduce this bipar- tisan bill. I have waited a long time for thisday, and I look forward to the next step forthis legislation, which is getting President Clin-ton to sign this into law. This day has been a long time coming, but it is a victory for those of us who are con-cerned about date rape drugs. This drug, GHB(Gamma Hydroxy-butyrate) has been used ininnumerable rapes around the country andhas been implicated in at least 40 deaths. Inaddition to date rape, this drug is very popularon the party scene in many cities and it iswidely abused. I was prompted to act to control the illicit use of GHB three years ago because of thedeath of Hillory J. Farias, of Laporte, Texas onAugust 5, 1996. I introduced a GHB bill in1997 and I have continued to advocate for itspassage to prevent more women from beingvictimized by date rape drugs. Hillory Farias was a 17-year-old high school senior, model student and varsity volleyballplayer who died as a result of GHB slippedinto her soft drink. Hillory and two of her girlfriends went out to a club where they consumed only soft drinks.At some point during the evening, GHB wasslipped into Hillory's drink and soon after-wards, Hillory complained of feeling sick witha severe headache. She went home to bed, but the next morn- ing, Hillory was found by her grandmother un-conscious and unresponsive. Hillory wasrushed to the hospital where she later died.Unfortunately, Hillory's death was not the only tragedy of this drug. My office has beencontacted by the families of several victims ofthis drug since March of last year. In January 1999, 15 year old Samantha Reid, a young lady from Michigan, died as aresult of this drug being put in her soda whileout with friends. Another 14 year old girl whowas also poisoned with GHB went into acoma. Four young men will go on trial for Samantha's murder this year. On January 2,Samantha would have been 16 years old. Samantha's death prompted other Members from the Michigan delegation to become inter-ested in this issue and thus, this legislation isnamed for both of these young women whoselives were cut short by this drug. There wasalso another incident in Michigan where fourteenagers at a party ingested GHB and lapsedinto comas during the Fourth of July holidaylast year. In addition to the tragic stories of Hillory and Samantha, my office was contacted by Rep-resentative L AFALCE's office with the story of Kerri Breton, from Syracuse, New York whoalso died from this drug being slipped into herdrink. Ms. Breton was away on a business trip and was having a drink in the hotel bar with a col-league. She was found the next day dead onthe bathroom floor of her hotel room. Herstepfather shared this painful story in hopethat it would alert others to the dangers of thisdrug. A young man from the Chicago area overdosed and almost died last September.He was a bodybuilder who had abused drugsfor years. The doctors and law enforcementofficials in the Chicago area did not know any-thing about GHB. If his sister had not beenaround when he lost consciousness, he wouldhave surely died. She called my office toshare the painful account of how her family al-most had to prepare for her brother's death. Just recently, I received more information about young people who are addicted to thisdrug. In Texas, there was a young womanwho was addicted to GHB and clinically diedtwice. She was also raped while on GHB, but she did not report it to the police because she feltthat it was her fault for getting high. She isnow in the process of rebuilding her lifethrough a drug detox program. These tragedies underscore the importance of this legislation. All of these incidents amongyoung people are strong evidence that thisdrug has a high potential for abuse and mustbe placed on the schedule for the ControlledSubstances Act. Without this bill, illicit use of GHB would in- crease dramatically. There are undoubtedlyother deaths that may not have been classi-fied as GHB-related because the drug is not apart of a standard toxicology screen. So far,there have been close to 50 confirmed deaths. GHB has been used to render victims help- less to defend against attack and it evenerases any memory of the attack. The recipefor this drug and its analogs can be accessedon the Internet. Currently, GHB is not legallyproduced in the United States. It is beingsmuggled across our borders or it is being ille-gally created here by ``bathtub'' chemists. As a drug of abuse, GHB is generally in- gested orally after being mixed in a liquid. Theonset of action is rapid, and unconsciousnesscan occur in as little as 15 minutes. Profound coma can occur within 30 to 40 minutes afteringestion. GHB has also been used by drug abusers for its alleged hallucinogenic effects and bybodybuilders who abuse GHB for an anabolicagent or as a sleep aid. I believe that by classifying this drug now, we send a strong message to those whowould use this drug and its analogs to commitcrimes against women. In addition to beingused for date rape, this drug is being abusedat alarming rates among young people. However, my position on the illicit use of GHB does not mean that I am insensitive tothe concerns of patients that might be helpedwith this drug. This drug has shown somebenefits to patients with a specific form of nar-colepsy in clinical trials. There is a possibility that GHB can be de- veloped for the treatment of cataplexy, a rareform of narcolepsy. Cataplexy is a rare dis-order that causes sudden and total loss ofmuscle control. People with cataplexy are un-able to work, drive or lead a normal life. Likemy colleagues, I understand the situation thataffects these patients and I am sensitive totheir need for treatment of that disorder. This bill reflects a compromise that takes into account the needs of the patient groupand the needs of law enforcement. This billenables law enforcement to prosecute anyonewho abuses GHB to the full extent of the lawby placing the drug on Schedule I of the Con-trolled Substances Act. Scheduling GHB on the Federal Controlled Substances Act allows prosecutors to punishanyone who uses a scheduled drug in anysexual assault crime to suffer penalties underthe Drug Induced Rape Prevention and Pun-ishment Act. This bill would increase the sen-tence for someone using GHB to commit asex crime to 20 years imprisonment. However, this bill protects people with cataplexy by providing an exemption for thoseenrolled in clinical trials now, and later it re-schedules the drug once it has been approvedby the FDA. The distribution of the drug would be strictly controlled to ensure that only patients in needof this drug would have access to it. Any illicituse of GHB would result in the enhanced sen-tence penalties. This bill also provides for a grant by the De- partment of Justice to research a forensic testto assist law enforcement in detecting GHB onthe street. This would improve the ability toprosecute date rape and other crimes involv-ing this substance. This provision provides lawenforcement with a crucial tool in fighting thisdrug on the street. This bill reaches a compromise that will benefit the patients who desperately need thisdrug for treatment and law enforcement agen-cies that need the tools to fight the use of thisdrug among young people. As I stated earlier, I have been working to pass legislation to schedule this drug for along time now because I do not want to see any more young lives cut short by GHB. Thereare many people who have been resources tomy staff these years and I would like to thankthem publicly for their work. I would like to thank all of the people who have been involved with this process from thebeginning and who provided me with informa-tion about this drug. One of my sources for in-formation was Trinka Porrata, a retired mem-ber of the Los Angeles police department. Shehas been a strong advocate for this legislation. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:05 Feb 31, 2000 Trinka has worked with my staff for the past three years on this legislation. She has cometo Washington to testify twice and she hasbeen a valuable resource of information onhow this drug has become popular on thestreet. I would like to thank the Farias family for sharing their story to help us inform othersabout this drug. Their tragedy and loss cannotbe overlooked and I appreciate their patiencewith us. We have worked closely with Hillory'sfamily and the Harris County medical exam-iner, Dr. Joy Carter, since I first introduced thisbill. I would also like to thank Samantha Reid's mother for her support of our efforts as well.Last year when this bill came to the floor, shevowed to call everyone she could to see itpass, and I thank her for her willingness toturn her tragedy into action to help save otherlives. I would also like to thank the families of the other victims who have shared their storieswith us as well. With the passage of this billtoday, I hope that there will be some comfortbrought to those families that their loved onesdid not die or suffer in vain. I thank my colleagues from Michigan\u00d0Rep- resentatives U PTON, STUPAK, and D INGELL\u00d0as well as Senator A BRAHAMwho were instru- mental in moving this legislation in memory ofthese young women. I would also like to thankmy other colleagues on the Commerce Com-mittee for helping to move this legislationthrough that Committee\u00d0Representatives B LI- LEYand BILIRAKIS. I would also like to thank the staff members at the Commerce Committee for their hardwork, especially John Ford with the Minoritystaff and John Manthei with the Majority staff. I would also like to thank the Members of the Judiciary Committee for their work on thisissue last year and this year\u00d0especially Rep-resentatives S COTT, CONYERS, MCCOLLUM, and Chairman H YDE. In 1998 we had a hear- ing on this issue in the Crime Subcommitteeand it shed a lot of light on the issue of daterape and illicit drug abuse of GHB. Finally, I would like to thank my staff for their hard work on this issue. Again, I thankmy colleagues for their support of this legisla-tion. Mr. Speaker, I was expecting another speaker, but I believe the travel dif-ficulties have delayed this person's ar-rival, so I yield back the balance of mytime. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say with the passage of this bill tonight, we willcertainly end a nightmare that no fam-ily ever wants to experience, whetherit be in Texas, Michigan, California, orany of the other 50 States. I want to particularly commend the hard work and diligence of all Memberson this legislation. It was about a yearago that our subcommittee first be-came involved in this, moving from thegood work that had been done in theCommittee on the Judiciary from aprevious Congress. We quickly discov-ered that, in fact, the laws were tooloose, the loopholes ought to be closed.Sadly, we still saw deaths even whenthat information became public. Mr. Speaker, these drugs are avail- able on the Internet. It has to stop.This bill does that. I look forward to working with all Members tonight tomake sure that this is passed and, obvi-ously, with the administration as theyhave indicated that they are going tosupport this legislation as well. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1230, ``The Hillory J. FariasDate Rape Prevention Drug Act of 1999.'' Thisimportant, bipartisan legislation was unani-mously approved by my Health and Environ-ment Subcommittee in July of last year, andthe House passed the bill in October. Today,the House will consider the Senate-passedversion of this legislation, and I urge my col-leagues to support this measure. H.R. 2130 was introduced by The bill amends the Controlled Sub- Act to make GHB a Schedule I drug,the DEA's most intensively regulated categoryof drugs. GHB is a central nervous system de-pressant that has been abused to assist in thecommission of sexual assaults. As a further protection, H.R. 2130 lists GBL, the primary precursor used in the productionof GHB, as a List I chemical. These com-pounds\u00d0GHB and GBL\u00d0are more commonlyknown as ``date-rape'' drugs. The bill before us includes language de- signed to protect very important and promisingresearch on an orphan drug that containsGHB and is used in the treatment of narco-lepsy patients. These provisions were adoptedas an amendment when the bill was consid-ered by my Health and Environment Sub-committee. I urge my colleagues to join me in sup- porting passage of H.R. 2130. Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of passage of H.R. 2130, the Hillory J.Farias Date Rape Prevention Act. In October,this House overwhelmingly passed this legisla-tion and I urge my colleagues to do so againtoday. As many of my colleagues know, I have long been concerned with the problem of drugabuse and date rape. In addition to other ef-forts, I am an original co-sponsor of H.R.2130, the legislation we are considering heretoday. H.R. 2130, as amended, is the productof a compromise worked out by numerousparties in the Commerce Committee, JudiciaryCommittee and the Senate to address theconcerns and needs of both law enforcementand patients. I am sure that all the members of this body have heard or read about the terrible incidentssurrounding GHB. GHB has been widely usedby nefarious individuals to help commit daterapes. It has been widely abused by teen-agers seeking an easily available illicit sub-stance. GHB is one of the first drugs in whichthe recipe for manufacture at home was wide-ly available over the Internet. People were lit-erally cooking up the drug in their house byobtaining the ingredients and instructions overthe Internet. H.R. 2130 addressed this issueby requiring tracking and reporting of possiblemisuse of GBL and other precursor chemicals.By requiring the Drug Enforcement Agency toschedule GHB, we will be giving the DEAstrong controls over the drug and allowingthem to combat the rampant abuse of thisdrug which we are currently seeing. Finally, the bill requires the Department of Justice to develop a forensic test to aid lawenforcement officials in determining when GHB or a GHB-related compound is involvedin a criminal activity. This will be helpful to lawenforcement officials who currently have noway of determining GHB's involvement in acrime or situation without laboratory testing. However, this bill recognizes that well-de- signed legislative efforts should not throw thebaby out with the bathwater, so to speak. Bythis, I mean that the abusive use of GHB wehave been focusing on should not preventpossible legitimate or beneficial uses of thedrug. For example, GHB has shown considerable promise for the treatment of narcolepsy. Spe-cifically, this drug could benefit the approxi-mately 30,000 people who suffer with a formof cataplexy, or the sudden loss of musclecontrol. Good public policy recognizes thesepatients and the important research which isbeing done attempting to address their seriousmedical concerns. The bill we are considering today, as passed by the Senate, is different from thelegislation we passed in October in a signifi-cant respect. Since the Senate-passed versiondoes not specifically schedule GHB on the listof controlled substances, but rather instructsthe DEA about how the scheduling shouldoccur. I want to make clear that Congress clearly intends that once GHB is approved bythe FDA, the DEA should place the drug intoSchedule III. We intend that this drug productbe treated in every respect as a Schedule IIIcontrolled substance. Only in this way can weensure that patients who need this drug willhave access to it. Mr. Speaker, a lot of work has gone into reaching this bipartisan legislation. I want tothank the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. J ACK- SON-LEE, for working with me so diligently on this issue. I want to thank the Chairman of theCommerce Committee Mr. B LILEY, as well as Mr. UPTONand Mr. B ILIRAKISwho were crucial in moving this bill through the CommerceCommittee. Finally I would like to thank Mr.D INGELL, as well as Mr. B ROWNand Mr. K LINK for working with us on our side to move thisbill. I urge the House to pass this bill so wecan prevent more deaths from the misuse of this dangerous substance. Mr. BLILEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2130, as amended by the Senate, ``theHillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act of 1999.'' As youknow, along with Mr. U PTON, Mr. STUPAK, and Ms. JACKSON-LEE, I am one of the original sponsors of this important legislation to ad-dress the growing national problem of theabuse of date rape drugs to facilitate sexualassaults on unsuspecting victims. By passingthis legislation today and sending it to thePresident to be signed into law, we will givethe DEA and law enforcement organizationsthe tools they need to take a significant stepforward in getting date rape drugs off of thestreets and out of the hands of criminals toprotect our Nation's youth. Although H.R. 2130, as amended by the Senate, uses different language, the intentwith respect to the scheduling of GHB underthe Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and list-ing GBL as a List I chemical remains exactlythe same as the bill that passed the full Houselast year. H.R. 2130, as amended, would VerDate place GHB into schedule I of the CSA. Sched- ule I gives the Drug Enforcement Administra-tion its strongest control over the drug, and al-lows prosecutors to impose the harshest pen-alties for those who abuse GHB. Additionally,as in the bill passed in October, registeredmanufacturers and registered distributors pos-sessing the drug pursuant to an FDA ap-proved Investigation New Drug exemption(IND) would be subject to schedule III securityrequirements under the CSA and imple-menting regulations. This will protect patientswith cataplexy\u00d0a severe and debilitating formof narcolepsy\u00d0by allowing years of promisingresearch to continue. Also, under H.R. 2130, as amended, if a drug product that contains GHB receives FDAapproval, the approved GHB drug product willbe placed in Schedule III of the CSA. How-ever, given the dangers involving this drug,H.R. 2130 adds additional reporting and ac-countability requirements to conform with therequirements for schedule I substances,schedule II drugs, and schedule III narcotics,and, significantly would maintain the strictschedule I criminal penalties for the unlawfulabuse of the approved drug product. Simplyput, these additional requirements and pen-alties in my opinion are needed to providegreater protection to our nation's youth, and togive our law enforcement agencies the abilityto penalize those who abuse this product tothe fullest extent under the law. These drugs are powerful sedatives, which in certain dosages can induce unconscious-ness or even death. In addition to the risk thatis posed by the misuse of these drugs by sex-ual predators, misuse of these drugs for rec-reational abuse is also a growing danger. Thenumbers of emergency room admissions foroverdoses, drunk driving accidents, and otherinjuries which are related to these drugs areall increasing with no end in sight. Certainly, itseems like almost every week that we read anew report involving the abuse of GHB andGBL. As many of you know, H.R. 2130, asamended, is named after a young Texaswoman, Hillory Farias, and a young womanfrom Michigan, Samatha died afterunknowingly ingesting GHB. We must do allthat we can to ensure that similar tragicevents do not occur again. By passing H.R.2130 today, we will take a significant step for-ward in that direction. Once again, I would liketo thank Mr. Upton for his leadership and tire-less efforts on this issue, and I look forward toseeing H.R. 2130 signed into law. Mr. HAYWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I commend and thank my colleague, Congressman F RED UPTON, for introducing H.R. 2130, the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape DrugProhibition Act. On December 17, 1999, Tom Gugliotta, who plays for the Phoenix Suns, suffered a seizureand was nearly killed after taking a form offuranone di-hydron, a generic chemical namefor gamma butyrolactone (GBL). In the UnitedStates, products containing GBL have beenmarketed as dietary supplements and the saleof GBL is not regulated in most states. GBL is the primary precursor used in the production of gamma-hydroxybutric acid(GHB). GHB has predominantly been abusedby America's youth to produce euphoric andhallucinatory states, and for its alleged role asa growth hormone releasing agent to stimulatemuscle. Additionally, GHB has been used toassist in the commission of sexual assaults.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has documented over 5,700 overdoses andlaw enforcement encounters with GHB and 58GHB-related deaths. GBL, once absorbed orally, is rapidly converted into GHB in thebody and produces the same profile of physio-logical and behavioral effects as GHB. In1999, the FDA issued several warnings aboutproducts that contain GBL and asked manu-facturers to voluntarily recall all products. Un-fortunately, products containing GBL remainavailable for sale over the Internet. H.R. 2130 directs the Attorney General to schedule GHB (together with its salts, iso-mers, and salts of isomers) a ``Schedule Idrug'', the DEA's most regulated drug cat-egory, under Substances Act(CSA). In addition, H.R. GBL as a ``List I chemical'', the regulated chemical category. Illicit use of many GHB analogues and pre- cursor chemicals is a significant and growinglaw enforcement problem. Importantly, H.R.2130 will help DEA not only control GHB, butthe full range of CSA drug control measureswould also apply to GBL. It is imperative that the DEA has necessary tools to control these dangerous substances tofurther prevent incidents such as TomGugliotta's seizure. Therefore, I urge an ayevote on H.R. 2130. Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, today the Congress will collectively move our nation yet anotherstep closer to a national police state by furtherexpanding a federal crime to include amongstthe list of controlled substances that of GHB,a nutrient used for 25 years with beneficial ef-fects for those suffering from cataplexy, in-somnia, narcolepsy, depression, alcoholism,opiate addiction and numerous other condi-tions. Of course, it is much easier to ride thecurrent wave of federalizing every human mis-deed in the name of saving the world fromsome evil than to uphold a Constitutional oathwhich prescribes a procedural limitation bywhich the nation is protected from what is per-haps the worst evil, totalitarianism. Who, afterall, and especially in an election year, wants tobe amongst those members of Congress whoare portrayed as being soft on drugs or rape,irrespective of the procedural transgressionsand individual or civil liberties one tramples intheir overzealous approach. Our federal government is, constitutionally, a government of limited powers. Article one,Section eight, enumerates the legislative areasfor which the U.S. Congress is allowed to actor enact legislation. For every other issue, thefederal government lacks any authority or con-sent of the governed and only the state gov-ernments, their designees, or the people intheir private market actions enjoy such rightsto governance. The tenth amendment is bru-tally clear in stating ``The powers not dele-gated to the United States by the Constitution,nor prohibited by it to the States, are reservedto the States respectively, or to the people.'' In his first formal complaint to Congress on behalf of the federal Judiciary, Chief JusticeWilliam H. Rehnquist said ``the trend to fed-eralize crimes that have traditionally been han-dled in state courts * * * threatens to changeentirely the nature of our federal system.''Rehnquist further criticized Congress for yield-ing to the political pressure to ``appear respon-sive to every highly publicized societal ill orsensational crime.'' Even if GHB is as potentially dangerous as the bill's advocates suggest, punishing pos-session of a useful substance because it po- tentially could be used in a harmful manner isas inconsistent with liberty as criminalizing thepossession of handguns and cars. Moreover, this bill empowers Health and Human Services to engage in a national prop-aganda campaign on the dangers of GHB,creates a special unit with the Drug Enforce-ment Agency to assess abuse and traffickingin GHB, and authorizes the Justice Depart-ment to issue taxpayer-funded grants for thedevelopment of police officer field-test equip-ment. Aside from being further abuses of enu-merated powers doctrine, the substantivequestions raised by this legislation make theseusurpations of state government authorityeven more reprehensible. Additionally, this Act undermines the re- cently enacted Dietary Supplement Health &Education Act (DSHEA) at the expense ofthousands of consumers who have safelyused these natural metabolites of the aminoacid GABA. According to practicing physicianWard Dean, West Point graduate and formerDelta Force flight surgeon, HR 2130 appearsto be a case of pharmaceutical-company-pro-tectionism. Because the substances restrictedunder this act are natural, and hence, non-pat-entable, the pharmaceutical concerns losemarket-share in areas for which GHB is asafer and less expensive means of treatingnumerous ailments. In a recent letter from Dr.Dean, he states: I have extensive experience in the clinical use of gamma hyudroxy butyric acid (GHB). . . I have used these substances for over tenyears on hundreds of patients (and have ad-vised thousands through my books and arti-cles on the subject). I have not had one in-stance reported to me of adverse effects inmy patients. GHB is the safest, most non-toxic sleep inducing substance known. It hasa wide range of other therapeutic uses. Thetherapeutic threshold for GHB is greaterthan almost any known pharmaceutical sub-stance (the LD50 is 40\u00b1100 times greater thanthe sleep-inducing therapeutic dose of 3\u00b16grams!). It is incongruous, to me, that a substance with such a wide range of documented bene-fits that is so overwhelmingly safe, can si-multaneously be both a Schedule I and aSchedule III substance. GHB is a naturallyoccurring substance, present in all mamma-lian tissue as well as many foods. Con-sequently, everyone is in ``possession'' ofthis ``controlled substance``\u00d0and every gro-cery store that sells meat is in ``possessionwith intent to distribute.'' These are not frivolous statements. In states where GHB isa Schedule I substance, there have been sev-eral instances where the charges have beendropped by the prosecution upon receipt ofdocumentation that GHB is in beef from thestate in question. I believe alleged violationsof this proposed federal law will be equallydifficult to successfully prosecute. Although GHB has been claimed to have been responsible for a small number ofdeaths, many of these cases are questionable.This is due to the fact that GHB is producedin significant quantities by the body postmortem, and is readily detectable in 96 outof 100 deceased persons even when no GHBhas been consumed. For each of the aforementioned procedural and substantive reasons, I must again opposeH.R. 2130, the Hillory J. Farias Date-RapePrevention Drug Act. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2130, and I commend thegentlemen from Michigan, Mr. U PTON, Mr. DIN- GELL, and Mr. S TUPAK, as well as our other VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:05 January 31, 2000 colleagues mentioned here today, for their work on this legislation. I am a cosponsor ofthis bill and I am glad we are making this oneof our first priorities this session. I look forwardto it becoming law very soon. H.R. 2130 will classify gamma hydroxy- butyric, or GHB, as a schedule I drug underthe Controlled Substances Act, as it is in myhome state of Michigan. This action is nec-essary due to the increased and pernicioususe of this drug. According to the U.S. DrugEnforcement Agency (DEA), at least 32deaths have been associated with GHB since1990, while over 3,500 overdoses have oc-curred. Emergency room visits due go GHBincreased nationally from 26 in 1992 to 629 in1996. Samantha Reid, one of the young women this bill is named after, was from Michigan.She died one year ago after unknowingly in-gesting GHB at a party. She was 15 years old.It is this type of senseless tragedy that H.R.2130 is meant to address. GHB is odorlessand colorless and is easily slipped into a drinkwithout the knowledge of the intended victim.It is generally used as a date-rape drug, acrime that affects women between the ages of16 and 24 more than any other age group. Itis estimated that one in four college womenhave been the victim of date-rape. H.R. 2130 directs the Department of Justice to develop model protocols for taking toxi-cology specimens and victim's statements inassociation with drugs used to commit date-rape. This is important because this crime toooften goes unreported. A recent study indi-cates that 84 percent of rape victims knewtheir attacker, and 57 percent of those wereraped on a date. Moreover, GHB is hard totrace, often leaving the body within 24 hours.The DEA will also create a special unit to ana-lyze the growing use of date-rape drugs andmake recommendations to the Attorney Gen-eral on how federal funds can best be used tocombat this problem.

VerDate 27-JAN-2000 January 31, 2000 SEC. 4. STUDY OF ALTERNATIVES FOR HANDLING ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANS-ACTIONS INVOLVING FOOD STAMPBENEFITS. Not later than 1 year after the date of en- actment of this Act, the Secretary of Agri-culture shall study and report to the Com-mittee on Agriculture of the House of Rep-resentatives and the Committee on Agri-culture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Sen-ate on alternatives for handling interstateelectronic benefit transactions involvingfood stamp benefits provided under the FoodStamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), in-cluding the feasibility and desirability of asingle hub for switching (as defined in sec-tion 7(k)(1) of that Act (as added by section3)). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the gentleman fromTexas (Mr. C OMBEST ) and the gen- tleman from Texas (Mr. S TENHOLM ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C OMBEST ). Mr. COMBEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, S. 1733, the Food Stamp ElectronicBenefit Transfer Interoperability andPortability Act. This bill was passedunanimously by the Senate last No-vember, and today the House will acton that bill. The bill provides for a national standard of interoperability and port-ability for the food stamp program.The bill requires the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture to set specific standardsfor States with electronic benefittransfer systems so that food stampparticipants can redeem their benefitsin neighboring States. Under the foodstamp coupon system, participants canredeem benefits in any retail foodstore. States want to apply this sameprinciple to the EBT system of deliveryof food assistance benefits. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G OODLATTE ), chairman of the sub- committee with jurisdiction over the food stamp program, introduced a simi-lar bill last year. I commend the chair-man of the subcommittee for his atten-tion to this matter and his work ensur-ing proper oversight of the food stampprogram. The Food Stamp Act already requires that all States issue food stamp bene-fits under an EBT system by the year2002. The EBT is a more efficient andeffective manner in which to providefood benefits for needy families. S. 1733requires the USDA, within 7 months ofenactment, adopt a uniform nationalstandard of interoperability and port-ability so that State-issued EBT cardscan be used in other States. The stand-ards are to be based on the standardsused by the majority of States, therebyenabling USDA to use flexibility inwriting the standards. The bill also provides for exemptions for States if they have entered intoEBT contracts using other standards.Also, waivers are provided for Statesoperating smart card food stamp sys-tems rather than debit card systems,as most States do. S. 1733 requires USDA to pay 1 per- cent of the costs of adopting thesestandards up to a maximum of $500,000 per year. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1733. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1733, the Electronic Benefit TransferInteroperability and Portability Act.This legislation is designed to ease thecurrent burdens on interstate trans-actions in the food stamp program. In 1996, Congress amended the Food Stamp Act by requiring the Secretaryof Agriculture to consider a cost-effec-tive alternative to the use of foodstamp coupons in order to reduce thecost of coupon redemption. The EBTsystem was developed. The switch to EBT cards is clearly a practical policy objective. Unfortu-nately, there is a lack of uniformityamong State EBT systems and thisnegatively affects the delivery of as-sistance to food stamp recipients,many of whom lose benefits when theytravel from State to State. For exam-ple, the different EBT designs of Texasand Oklahoma limit a Texas foodstamp participants's choice by pre-venting shopping in other States wherethe EBT system designs and proceduresare not uniform. This was not the caseunder the previous inefficient couponsystem. S. 1733 addresses the uniformity issue in a practical and accountable manner.Specifically, it requires the Secretaryof Agriculture to adopt a uniform na-tional standard of interoperability andportability that is used by a majorityof State agencies. At the present timea majority of States are using a stand-ard referred to as ``QUEST.'' This wasdeveloped by the National AutomatedClearing House Association EBT Coun-cil which includes State food stampprogram administrators, retailers, andfood and nutrition officials. Mr. Speaker, under S. 1733, the Sec- retary of Agriculture will be allowed tomodify the QUEST rules in order tosolve future problems. This discre-tionary authority is important to myState of Texas for a couple of reasons. Texas operates the Nation's largest EBT system for food stamps, benefit-ting 1.5 million Texas recipients or635,000 households per month. The realchallenge for Texas is the search for areplacement of its full service EBTcontract in a market with limited com-petition and increased pricing, lowerlevels of service and less Statecustomization. In order to remedy the lack of com- petition in the EBT market, Texas willserve as its own prime EBT contractorwhile issuing various subcontracts forspecific EBT services, including theinteroperability and portability com-ponents. This method will give Texasand other States a better chance of de-livering uninterrupted, timely, and ac-curate food stamp benefits in a cost-ef-fective manner.The bill's language in section 4(a) ac- commodates these concerns by requir-ing the Secretary to use the QUESTrules as a starting point and permit-ting necessary changes to those rulesas the dictates of the food stamp pro-gram require. Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation sets an annual cap of $500,000 to pay forthe switching and settling charges as-sociated with interstate food stamppurchases. This cost issue has been thecause of some disagreement. TheStates were correct in their belief thatthe Food and Nutrition Service shouldpay for all of the costs associated withinterstate transactions. We should not,however, set a precedent suggestingthat the Federal Government will payfor every new technology advancementused by retailers who participate in thefood stamp program. National uniformity among State food stamp systems will mean that pro-gram participants will no longer en-counter problems with the use of theirEBT cards beyond the borders of theissuing State. I urge my colleagues tosupport the passage of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COMBEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-ginia (Mr. G OODLATTE ). Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.C OMBEST ), my chairman, for yielding me this time and for his support of thisimportant legislation. Mr. Speaker, on August 4, 1999, I in- troduced H.R. 2709, the Electronic Ben-efit Transfer Interoperability and Port-ability The Senator fromIllinois, Senator F ITZGERALD , intro- duced an almost identical bill, S. 1733,which passed the Senate at the end ofthe first session of the 106th Congress;and it is that bill that we considertoday. The sole focus of my bill was to allow food stamp beneficiaries the ability toredeem their benefits in any generalstore, regardless of location. Bene-ficiaries had this ability under the oldfood stamp system, but lost it asStates migrated to an electronic bene-fits transfer system. Under the old paper food stamp sys- tem, recipients could redeem their foodcoupons in any authorized food storeanywhere in the country. For example,a food stamp recipient living in BathCounty, Virginia, could use their foodstamps in their favorite grocery store,even if that happened to be in WestVirginia. Similarly, a recipient livingin Tennessee could visit their motherin Virginia and purchase food for theirchildren while away from home. Unfortunately, as we move to elec- tronic delivery of benefits, this is cur-rently not the case. My bill providesfor the portability of food assistancebenefits and allows food stamp recipi-ents the flexibility of shopping at loca-tions that they choose. Across thecountry we are finding that people livein one State and shop in another. This VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:05 Feb January 31, 2000 cross-border shopping is conducted for a variety of reasons. One of them isconvenience. Another is the cost ofgoods. The supermarket industry is very competitive. Every week, stores adver-tise specials in newspaper ads acrossthe country. People not only shop atlocations convenient to them but alsoshop around for the best prices. Cus-tomers paying with every type of ten-der except EBT have the flexibility toshop where they choose. 1445 Why should recipients of food assist- ance benefits not be allowed to stretchtheir dollars in the same way thatother consumers do without regard toState borders? EBT portability is simply allowing recipients of benefits under the foodstamp program to redeem those bene-fits without regard to State borders atthe stores they choose. In addition toportability, my legislation allows forthe interoperability of EBT trans-actions. Interoperability can be simplydefined as the ability of various com-puters involved in authorizing, routing,and selling an EBT transaction to talkto each other. I offered a Sense of the Congress amendment to the Welfare Reform billthat Congress passed in 1996. Myamendment urged States to work to-gether to achieve a seamless system offood stamp benefit redemption. Statesdid a decent job considering the cir-cumstances. They are now asking foran extra nudge to realize the goal ofmy earlier amendment. My legislation requires States to conform their EBT standards to a na-tional uniform operating system thatthe States themselves choose. Theclear choice, the Quest operating sys-tem, has already been adopted by 33States. Pilot studies have been conducted to determine the cost and other effi-ciencies that might be realized by EBTinteroperability. The pilot program de-termined my bill would only cost thefood stamp program $500,000. That isnot a lot of money for an $18 billion program. Also, the State of Missouri found around $32 million in abuse of the pro-gram that they never would have foundif their EBT system could not talkwith neighboring State systems orthey found people were getting dualfood stamps, applying for and receivingfood stamps in more than one State. Mr. Speaker, the bill we consider today is simple. It returns the nationalredemption convenience to the bene-ficiaries of the program, gives theStates the guidance they are lookbeing for, and provides another tool inthe fight against fraud, waste, andabuse in the food stamp program. I thank my colleagues for this time, and I urge support from the member-ship for the Electronic Benefit TransferInteroperability and Portability Act. Mr. COMBEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio(Mr. B OEHNER ).Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the gentleman fromTexas (Mr. C OMBEST ), the chairman of the committee, and the gentlemanfrom Texas (Mr. S TENHOLM ), the rank- ing member, for the job that they havedone. Specifically, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Virginia (Chair-man G OODLATTE ) and commend him on his efforts here today regarding theEBT bill. This common sense piece of legisla- tion will achieve portability for the de-livery of food stamp benefits in everyState across the Nation. The legisla-tion that my colleague has introducedis very important as the States makethe transition from paper coupons orfood stamps to a more efficient elec-tronic system. As my colleagues know, the State of Ohio has been an innovator in thisarea, having developed an extremelysuccessful Smart Card program for thedelivery of food stamp benefits to morethan 300,000 recipients in my homeState. In this regard, I wish to engage my colleague from Virginia in a colloquyto receive assurances that his bill willin no way harm the innovative tech-nology that Ohio has adopted for deliv-ering benefits. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. BOEHNER. I yield to the gen- tleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio foryielding to me and for his interest andsupport of this legislation. I very muchappreciate his kind remarks and forbringing this particular concern to myattention. In the legislation that the House is now considering, there are provisionsthat have been included to ensure thatthe two existing Smart Card programsthat are currently in place, those beingOhio and Wyoming, will not be forcedto make any changes that would resultin either new or additional expenses forthe States. Ohio and Wyoming can continue using their Smart Cards until the Sec-retary determines that a practicabletechnological method is available forinteroperability between electronicbenefit transfer Smart Card systemsand the magnetic stripe card systemsthat most other States are using. Furthermore, the legislation provides safeguards so that these off-line pro-grams are not jeopardized in any way. It is my understanding that both Ohio and Wyoming chose to embracethis Smart Card technology for the de-livery of benefits with the blessing andapproval of the United States Depart-ment of Agriculture. Therefore, Ohioand Wyoming should not be required tochange their systems until they are in-terested in doing so. I wish to ensure my good friend and colleague from Ohio (Mr. B OEHNER ) that the legislation's waiver sectionand the provision for specific exemp-tions for Smart Card systems were in- corporated into these initiatives withOhio and Wyoming's interest in mind. As a footnote, I should mention that the technology is not currently avail-able in the marketplace for on- and off-line systems to be compatible andinteroperable. However, that day israpidly approaching. In the short term, it is my hope that the Congress will have the opportunityto work toward a national standard forSmart Cards as other States like Ohioand Wyoming begin to consider theirown Smart Card projects for domesticfeeding programs, unemployment com-pensation, health care, and other bene-fits. It is my view that there is muchto learn from Ohio's leadership and ex-perience in this area. Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, re- claiming my time, I want to thank thechairman for his comments. As I understand his comments, Ohio would not, then, be required to changeits off-line system to an on-line systemunder this proposal? Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield,he is correct; Ohio, as well as Wyo-ming, would not be required to makeany changes. And for that matter,those States currently using an on-linesystem that does not achieve the na-tional interoperability standard wouldnot be required to meet this standarduntil their current contracts expire. Finally, I should point out that in the case of Ohio and Wyoming's SmartCard programs, the bill's waiver lan-guage and Smart Card provisions pro-vide a clear exemption with no timelimit imposed as to when changeswould have to be made. Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, re- claiming my time, I appreciate thesevery important clarifications with re-gard to how legislation relates toSmart Card changes, especially myhome State of Ohio. Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time on thisside. I would just conclude by thankingthe gentleman from Virginia (Chair-man G OODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Texas (Chairman C OMBEST ) for their work on this piece of legislation,and I urge our colleagues to support it. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I rise to sup- port this important bill that amends the FoodStamp Act of 1977 to provide for a nationalstandard of interoperability and portability ap-plicable to electronic food stamp benefit trans-actions. This measure ensures that our citizens can use their food stamp cards in any state. Cur-rently, citizens in my home State of Texascannot use their cards in any other states\u00d0asituation that hinders their ability to obtain vitalnecessities while traveling to other states.Clearly, we do not want our citizens burdenedwhen they cross state lines to visit friends andfamilies. By amending the Food Stamp Act of 1977 with this bill, we can provide for a nationalstandard of interoperability and portability ap-plicable to electronic food stamp benefit trans-actions enhance food stamp interstate com-merce. This measure would bring the food VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 January 31, 2000 stamp process into a new age of technology by requiring systems that provide for the elec-tronic issuance, use, and redemption of cou-pons in the form of electronic benefit transfercards to be interoperable, and food stampbenefits to be made portable, among allStates not later than October 1, 2002. I appreciate that this bill works in conjunc- tion with the Secretary of Agriculture. Themeasure appropriately directs the Secretary ofAgriculture to promulgate regulations thatadopt a national standard based upon astandard used by the majority of States andrequire any electronic benefit transfer contract(as defined by this Act) entered into 30 daysor more after promulgation of such regulationsbe in accordance with the national standard. The bill also includes language to rectify po- tential technological difficulties. This piece oflegislation authorizes the Secretary to providea requesting State with a temporary deadlinewaiver based upon unusual technological bar-riers. It is also vitally important that we provide for an interim system until the electronic standardis completed. This bill directs the Secretary toallow a State using a smart card food stampdelivery system to continue such system untila technological method is available for elec-tronic benefit transfer card interoperability.Sets forth the conditions for full Federal pay-ment of State switching costs, including an-nual fiscal year caps. In an effort to provide a thorough analysis of this undertaking, this measure directs the Sec-retary of Agriculture to conduct a study of al-ternatives for handling food stamp benefitelectronic transactions, including use of a sin-gle switching hub. I am aware that this measure passed the Senate, and I appreciate the bipartisan effortto enact this bill. I support this fine piece oflegislation. Mrs. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1733, the Electronic BenefitTransfer (EBT) Interoperability and PortabilityAct. I'd like to thank Chairman L ARRYCOM- BESTand Chairman B OBGOODLATTE for bring- ing this bill to the floor today and for theirstrong leadership on this important issue. Interoperability of food stamp EBT systems makes sense both for recipients and retailers.As USDA moves from paper food coupons toEBT cards, interoperability ensures that recipi-ents will retain the same portability as before.Recipients will be able to access stores near-est to their homes and retailers will be able toserve their customers regardless of stateboundaries. In areas of the country near statelines, such as in my Congressional District inSouthern Missouri, incompatible EBT systemshave been a significant problem for bothgroups. I am very pleased that the bill beforeus today will resolve this problem and bringthe best technology to the food stamp pro-gram. The government and the taxpayer, too, are well served by S. 1733, because it establishesa new mechanism for tracking and policingfraud and abuse in the food stamp program. Inmy home state of Missouri, the Department ofSocial Services estimates that an interoper-able EBT system would save the federal gov-ernment as much as $1 million annually in re-duced fraud in Missouri alone. One aspect of S. 1733 that I would like to highlight is that it provides 100% federal fund-ing of the costs associated with switching andsettling interstate transactions. These costs will not be imposed on other entities, such asretail food stores, states, and food stamphouseholds. This is entirely appropriate be-cause these costs are directly related to ad-ministering the program on a nationwide basis,not within a particular state. Again, I would like to reiterate to my col- leagues that this is a very sensible piece oflegislation that deserves the support of thisHouse. I urge a strong ``Yes'' vote. Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMBEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P ETRI).

AIR QUALITY AND AIR POLLUTION IN THE STATE OF TEXAS MUSTBE ADDRESSED (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to addressthe House for 1 minute and to reviseand extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this evening the environ-mental agency of the State of Texaswill hold a meeting to address thequestion of air quality and air pollu-tion in the City of Houston in theState of Texas. I rise to the floor toask my constituents and the State of Texas to take seriously the devastationthat we have experienced with poor airquality. Many of my constituents arealready suffering from a high degree ofrespiratory illnesses. Houston has beennoted as the number one city with airpollution. In addition, we have not come up with solutions that can address theconcerns and remedy the problem. Tonight, although I will not be able to join my constituents in this meet-ing, I am pleading that we work withthe Environmental Protection Agency;that we work with our State environ-mental agency; that we ask the gov-ernor of the State of Texas to join withus to expeditiously formulate a planthat will address the concerns that aredevastating our community, poor airquality, poor health conditions; andthat this evening we will have an openand vigorous debate and discussionthat real solutions can come about atthe meeting being held at the Houston-Galveston council tonight at 7:00 p.m.in Houston, Texas; and that we will re-alize that the Environmental Protec-tion Agency is there to help and not tohurt; and that we will have a plan thatwill help to enhance the quality of lifeof all Houstonians in the State ofTexas. SPECIAL ORDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. STEARNS). Under the Speaker's an-nounced policy of January 6, 1999, andunder a previous order of the House,the following Members will be recog-nized for 5 minutes each. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Mississippi (Mr. P ICK- ERING ) is recognized for 5 minutes. (Mr. PICKERING addressed the House. His remarks will appear here-after in the Extensions of Remarks.) THE TITANS ARE TRULY TENNESSEE'S TEAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Tennessee (Mr. C LEMENT ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CLEMENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because of a great game thattook place last night that we know ofas the Super Bowl that not only cap-tures the hearts and minds of the peo-ple in the United States but worldwide,because football is definitely a world-wide sport. I am from the State of Tennessee. I represent the 5th Congressional Dis-trict, Nashville, Tennessee, that isknown as Country Music U.S.A., theAthens of the South; but we also havesomething that we are awfully proud ofand we just completed a stadium thatthe Tennessee Titans, who used to becalled the Houston Oilers, now play in.We are awfully proud of our team, theTennessee Titans.The Titans got their name from Nashville being known as the Athens ofthe South. We have a replica of theParthenon in Nashville, Tennessee. Soit seemed to make a lot of sense whenwe talk about why it was named Ti-tans, because of Greek gods and Greekmythology. I might say that the Ten-nessee Titans rose to the occasion, andwhat a season they have had. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the American Football ConferenceChampion Tennessee Titans from the5th Congressional District of Ten-nessee. The Titans finished their inau-gural season at the Adelphia Coliseumin Nashville with an all-time best 13\u00b13record, and then went on to defeattheir foes the Buffalo Bills, the Indian-apolis Colts, and the Jacksonville Jag-uars, Mr. Speaker, that you supported,in outstanding play-off games, becom-ing the undisputed champions of theAFC. The Titans then completed the year with a 16\u00b14 overall record, playing inthe football world championship, theSuper Bowl, for the first time in thehistory of the franchise. The entireTitan team is to be commended fortheir courage, strength, and valor inthis inaugural season in Nashville.They have faced adversity over theyears, but now they can truly say theyhave come home to Tennessee. I also want to congratulate owner Bud Adams, along with coach JeffFisher and the entire Titans' coachingstaff for steering this team to victoryafter victory, as well as the TennesseeTitans' fans for being named the bestfans in the NFL. Tennessee may not have won the Super Bowl trophy, but the Titansplayed their hearts out down to thevery last second and made every Ten-nessean proud. The Titans are trulyTennessee's team. On behalf of Titans'fans everywhere, I want to thank theteam for giving us the best season wecould have ever dreamed of and for let-ting the world know that Tennessee isa force to be reckoned with both on andoff the field. Mr. Speaker, I also want to congratu- late the St. Louis Rams. What a greatseason they have had. I want to con-gratulate Kurt Warner. He is not onlythe quarterback for the St. Louis Ramsbut a great man, with great characterand great vision who led them to vic-tory last night. 1845 I also want to say, on behalf of the people of Tennessee, we are pleased tohave a professional football team inour great State. In a lot of ways, wethought Memphis deserved it a lotmore than Nashville because Memphishad worked so hard for so many yearsto capture a team. It happened to fallour lot to have the Tennessee Titans,which we consider a State-wide team,not just a local or regional team. Butthe Tennessee Titans have truly shownthat they have a lot of courage. Theyare going to have great years ahead of VerDate 27-JAN-2000 03:04 Feb January 31, 2000 them as well, because we know that they are coming back and getting thatmuch stronger. I want to congratulate our quarter- back, too, our quarterback for the Ten-nessee Titans and Eddie George and AlDel Greco, and we can go on and onwith the great players we have had,and Marcus Robertson, who was hurt inthe game before, who was decentenough through his foundation to giveus or send four young people to Wash-ington, D.C. to a youth violence event. Those are the kinds of examples we need in the future, not just footballplayers but football players with cour-age, football players with characterthat will set an example to our youngpeople as we move into the 21st cen-tury and prepare for the future. ELIAN AND FREEDOM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from Florida (Ms. R OS- LEHTINEN ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, there are those who doubt the argu-ment that returning Elian Gonzalez toCuba actually means returning a 6-year-old boy to the Castro regime.There are those who question the im-portance or relevance of the sacrificethat Elian's mother made to ensurethat he would live in freedom. Thereare still others who would questionElian's ability to express his own de-sires and to help determine his ownfate. However, those who have lived under totalitarian rule do not doubt. Theyknow what it means to live in fear, infear of persecution, in fear of arrest, infear of torture and even death becauseof one's belief. They have suffered en-slavement and subjugation by Com-munist regimes which not only stoletheir present but destroyed their fu-ture by exerting absolute control overtheir children's lives. Someone oncesaid, it is easy to take liberty forgranted when you have never had ittaken from you. I ask those who seek to oversimplify this case by advocating Elian's imme-diate return, without a court hearingand without following U.S. law, not tomake that mistake. I ask them to hearthe pleas of the members of organiza-tions such as the Americans for HumanRights in Ukraine, who are appealingto Congress to act in Elian's case. They write: ``We know from recent past experience that Communist re-gimes are dangerous to the health andspirit of people under its control.'' Forthis reason, this group has asked us ``touse our good offices to help a little boyto live in freedom.'' I ask Members to listen to Viet- namese-American refugee advocate HaiTran, who reminds us of how many Vi-etnamese mothers wiped off their tearsand sent their children away to a seaton that rickety boat so that theymight have a future, how many Viet-namese mothers and their children diedat sea in search of freedom away from that bamboo gulag. Because he knowsthe value and the sanctity of freedom,Hai Tran believes it is Elian's right tolife and liberty here in the UnitedStates. I ask those who support INS's unilat- eral decision to return Elian to Cuba toheed the questions proposed by SusanRosenbluth in her editorial for thenewspaper Jewish Voice and Opinion.She writes, ``Imagine a Jewish fatherin Addis Ababa circa 1983, or Moscowcirca 1987, or Damascus circa 1990, orTehran right now. Imagine the boy's mother finds a way to escape with the child. In the midstof the plan, something goes wrong andshe dies, but miraculously, the littleboy makes it. When he wakes up, hefinds himself in Tel Aviv surrounded byhis family, but the father is still in thecountry where dictators have the lastword. Would the boy be returned towhatever totalitarian nightmare hismother had rescued him from?'' Susan Rosenbluth continues, in the Jewish Voice and Opinion, ``If ourhearts know the right answer for thehypothetical Jewish child in thatstory, then we must understand thatElian Gonzalez, the little boy whosemother died trying to rescue him fromCuba, belongs in the U.S., and that ifhis loving father could speak freely,that is what he would say, too. After focusing on these statements, it is difficult to discount the impor-tance of considering the environmentthat Elian would be exposed to in Cuba.It becomes readily apparent that aforum must be provided where themother's wishes and ultimate sacrificeare also evaluated. This can only takeplace, justice can indeed only be servedby allowing a court of law to hear thecase. The INS disagrees because it is ap- plying Cuban law to the case. Congress,however, must be guided by U.S. lawsand international standards requiringdue process. President Harry Truman once said, you know that being an American ismore than a matter of where your par-ents come from. It is a belief that allmen are created free and equal, andthat everyone deserves an even break. That is my belief, and I know it is my colleagues', as well. I ask that welive up to our commitment to upholdand protect the rights endowed to allhuman beings, and that we search ourconsciences before making a summaryjudgment to send Elian back to Cas-tro's Cuba. We have an opportunity to make a difference in this little boy's life; todemonstrate, through our actions, ouradherence to the principles that arethe rubric of our democratic society; tosend a message from our resolve on be-half of oppressed men, women, andchildren everywhere. Let us not squan-der it.TRIBUTE TO KURT WARNER, A REAL AMERICAN HERO The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Minnesota (Mr. G UT- KNECHT ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a tribute to avery special person. President Reaganonce observed that those who say thereare no more American heroes, well,they just do not know where to look. Paul Simon asked a haunting ques- tion in his song many years ago,``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?A Nation turns its lonely eyes to you.''America has always wanted heroes, andtoo often in sports we have foundcounterheroes. I want to pay tribute tonight to a real American hero, a gentleman bythe name of Kurt Warner. The Warnerstory has been documented in the lastweek or so by many sports scribes, andI do want to ultimately submit for theR ECORD an article which was written by the sports editor of our local news-paper, Bob Brown in the RochesterPost Bulletin. I guess I have a special feeling for Kurt Warner for a lot of reasons. Firstof all, his grandparents are fromFaribault, Minnesota, which is in mydistrict. Second, he went to the samecollege that I did, the University ofNorthern Iowa in Cedar Falls, Iowa.Third, he worked for the Hy-Vee gro-cery store in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and sodid I. Fourth, I guess I would have tosay, his wife, Brenda, spent several ofher formative years living in a home onWest Ninth Street in Cedar Falls, Iowa,right next to my parents. So I guess I have had a fairly special relationship, even though Kurt Warnerand I have never met. But I have fol-lowed his career from the time he wasat UNI, and I have come to appreciatenot only his talents on the field, butthe kind of human being that he reallyis. We saw that yesterday, and we haveseen it as his career has developed. He has kept his head on straight. He has kept his focus on the things thatwere important in his life. The story isjust such a powerful story. It could nothave happened to a nicer individual. The story of Kurt Warner is one that every American should be proud of. Hewent to college and was red-shirted hisfirst year, spent 3 years on the bench,and finally got his chance to play atthe University of Northern Iowa. Heled his team to the midconferencechampionship. He was not drafted byanybody in the NFL, but he was al-lowed to come to the Packers' trainingcamp. He was cut. After he was cut bythe Packers he returned to Cedar Fallsand worked at that Hy-Vee grocerystore I talked about earlier. The great thing about Kurt Warner is that he never lost his faith. Like theparable of the talents in the Bible, heunderstood that almighty God hadgiven him special talents, and he wasexpected to make the most of them, sohe stuck with those talents long after VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 January 31, 2000 some of the experts would probably have encouraged him to give up. But the story of Kurt Warner goes on. Not only did he go on to lead theRams this year to the NFL champion-ship in the Super Bowl and to the MVPaward, but I think the story is muchmore powerful. After the game wasover, he gave tribute and paid honor towhere the real honor belonged, and hegave all of the glory to his savior,Jesus Christ. I just want to say, it tooka special kind of courage for him to dothat. The story, as I say, goes on. Not only has Warner battled obstructions on thefield to get where he is, but he has alsohad his share of off-the-field struggles,as well. His in-laws were killed in atornado in Mountain View, Arkansas.Kurt and his wife Brenda's oldest sonZachary has been blind since sufferinga head injury in an accident when hewas a baby. Zachary is only able to seeobjects that are held very close to hisface. He has been that way since he wasan infant, when his father, Brenda'sfirst husband, accidentally dropped thechild during a bath. Zachary has head injuries, but Kurt went on to adopt the child. He sayslater in this interview, ``To go homeand see how he struggles with every-thing he does helps keep things in per-spective,'' Warner said. ``I have realizedhow special a child he must be to gothrough life with the excitement andthe joy he has, even though he has tostruggle doing everything he does.'' The story of Kurt Warner is a power- ful story, and we in America I thinkowe him a big thank you, because forone brief, shining moment, we were allprivileged to watch a real hero performhis art and perfect our lives. On behalf of a grateful Nation, I would like to say a special thank youto Kurt Warner. Good luck to he andhis wife Brenda. We wish them only thebest. As Paul Harvey would say, leadon. Mr. Speaker, I include for the R ECORD the article of January 29, 2000, from the Post-Bulletin. The article referred to is as follows: [From the Post-Bulletin, January 29, 2000] WARNER HASSTORY TOTELL: QUARTERBACK 'S TALE IS MEMORABLE The story of this Super Bowl is Kurt War- ner. What the St. Louis Rams' quarterback has gone through to become the National Foot-ball League's Most Valuable Player this sea-son and to lead his team to the Super Bowlis amazing, utterly amazing. Here are some things about Warner you might want to keep in mind as you watchhim play in Super Bowl XXXIV Sundayagainst the Tennessee Titans. He went to high school and college just down Highway 63 from us. Born in Bur-lington, Iowa, he attended Cedar RapidsRegis High School, lettering in football, bas-ketball and baseball. He played college foot-ball at Northern Iowa University in CedarFalls. He was redshirted his first year at North- ern Iowa, sat the bench for the next threeyears and started only as a fifth-year senior.Warner wasn't even on full scholarship untilhis last year in college. He did pass for 2,747 yards and led Northern Iowa to a GatewayConference championship in 1993. Warner wasn't drafted by any NFL teams. He went to the green Bay Packers' trainingcamp in 1994. He was cut before camp wasover, but he was there long enough for Pack-er quarterback Brett Favre to tag him withthe nick-name ``Pop'' Warner. After he was cut by the Packers he re- turned to Cedar Falls and worked for sixmonths stocking shelves at the Hy-Vee gro-cery store there. Warner went on to play with the Des Moines-based Iowa Barnstormers in theArena Football League for the next threeseasons. He holds virtually all the Barn-stormers' passing records, including 79touchdown passes in one season (1997). Hepassed for 10,164 yards and 183 touchdowns inthree seasons in Iowa. Warner signed as a free agent with the Rams on Dec. 26, 1997 and then spent thesummer of 1998 playing in NFL Europe forthe Amsterdam Admirals and led the leaguein passing and touchdowns. Warner, a devout Christian, spent time in Amsterdam, a city known for its red lightdistrict, leading a bible study class. Warner rejoined the Rams for the 1998 NFL season, and spent the first 14 games on theinactive list. He saw his first NFL action ofhis career in the fourth quarter of Rams'final game against San Francisco and com-pleted four of 11 passes for 39 yards. Warner was back with the Rams this sea- son, only because the Cleveland Brownspassed him over in the expansion draft. Theline on Warner as he entered this season was:Has potential to develop into a solid quarter-back in the league . . . raw talent with out-standing arm strength and accuracy. The Rams had signed Trent Green who played at Washington last season, to be theirquarterback, but he suffered a knee injury inthe preseason and was out for the year. Instepped Warner and the rest is history. Heled the NFL in passing and with his 41 touch-down passes became only the second playerin NFL history to throw for more than 40touchdowns in a season. Not only has Warner battled obstacles on the field to get to where he is, but he has hadhis share of of-the-field hurdles, too. His in-laws were killed in a tornado in MountainView, Ark., in 1996. Kurt and wife Brenda'soldest Zachary, has been blind since suf-fering a head injury in an accident when hewas a baby. Zachary, is only able to see objects that are held close to his face. He's been that waysince he was an infant, when his father,Brenda's first husband, accidentally droppedthe child during a bath. Zachary's head hitthe side of the tub, which damaged his brainand ruptured his retinas. The accident almost killed the child, and doctors warned Brenda that if Zachary livedhe'd never be able to see or walk or talk. Hesurvived, despite seizures in the hospital,and when the Warners got married, Kurtadopted the boy, and his sister, Jesse, 8. ``To go home and see how he struggles with everything he does helps me keep things inperspective,'' Warner said. ``I have realizedhow special a child he must be to go throughlife with the excitement and joy he has eventhough he has to struggle doing everythinghe does.'' So that is the Kurt Warner story. It's dif- ficult not to pull for a guy like him. Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, if the gen- tleman will yield, I begin by congratu-lating my very good friend, the gen-tleman from Minnesota (Mr. G UT- KNECHT ) for his very thoughtful special order. Representing Los Angeles, theformer home of the Rams, I would like to extend hearty congratulations toKurt Warner and Dick Vermeil and allassociated with the Rams organizationfor their very impressive and excitingvictory towards the end yesterday. REPORT ON RESOLUTION PRO- VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OFH.R. 1838, TAIWAN SECURITY EN-HANCEMENT ACT Mr. D REIER , from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report(Rept. No. 106\u00b1490) on the resolution (H.Res. 408) providing for consideration ofthe bill (H.R. 1838) to assist in the en-hancement of the security of Taiwan,and for other purposes, which was re-ferred to the House Calendar and or-dered to be printed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Indiana (Mr. S OUDER ) is recognized for 5 minutes. (Mr. SOUDER addressed the House. His remarks will appear hereafter inthe Extensions of Remarks.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle-woman from Idaho (Mrs. C HENOWETH - HAGE) is recognized for 5 minutes. (Mrs. CHENOWETH-HAGE addressed the House. Her remarks will appearhereafter in the Extensions of Re-marks.) INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO PROMOTE PIPELINE SAFETY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Washington (Mr.M ETCALF ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. METCALF. Mr. Speaker, on June 10, 1999, a liquid gasoline pipelineowned by the Olympic Pipeline Com-pany ruptured and spilled over 200,000gallons of gasoline at Whatcom FallsPark, a 241-acre park in my district inthe city of Bellingham. Gasoline wascarried into Whatcom Creek, where itreportedly filled the creek at depths ofup to 10 feet. The spilled fuel was inadvertently ig- nited by two 10-year-old boys, WadeKing and Stephen Tsiorvas, who wereplaying with bottle rockets at thecreek. The resulting fireball raceddown the length of the creek for a mileand a half, killing King, Tsiorvas, andan 18-year-old fly fisherman namedLiam Wood. Swaths as wide as 200 feetalong the creek were burned withinminutes. The explosion of June 10 caused mil- lions of dollars in property damage anddid immeasurable harm to the familiesand friends of Wade King, StephenTsiorvas, and Liam Wood. I have long held reservations about our system of pipeline safety regula-tions. In 1996, I voted against the pipe-line deregulation bill because I felt it VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 31, 2000 removed too many essential safe- guards. Since the tragedy, I have re-doubled my efforts to improve the reg-ulatory climate. I have been in close contact with in- dustry, public interest groups, local of-ficials, Federal regulators, and con-stituents. 1900 The bill that I have introduced today addresses several concerns. Under mylegislation, number one, pipelines willbe required to be inspected both inter-nally and with hydrostatic tests. Pipe-lines with a history of leaks will bespecifically targeted for more stren-uous testing. All pipeline operatorswill be tested for qualifications andcertified by the Department of Trans-portation. The results of pipeline tests and in- spections will be made available to thepublic and a nationwide map of allpipeline locations will be placed on theInternet where ordinary citizens caneasily access it. All pipeline rupturesand spills of more than 40 gallons willbe reported to the Federal Office ofPipeline Safety. And States will beable to set up their own pipeline safetyprograms for interstate pipelines. In addition, the bill requires studies on various technologies that may im-prove safety such as external leak de-tection systems and double-walledpipelines. The bill has already bipartisan sup- port. My distinguished colleagues, thegentlewoman from Washington (Ms.D UNN), the gentleman from Washington (Mr. I NSLEE ), and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. S MITH) have agreed to cosponsor; and I thank them verymuch for that. Mr. Speaker, we hope to move this legislation through Congress and Ihope the rest of my colleagues can joinwith me in support of this bipartisanproposal. CBO COST ESTIMATE ON H.R. 1838, TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCE-MENT ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. G REEN of Wisconsin). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman fromNew York (Mr. G ILMAN ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, set forth below is the cost estimate of the Congressional BudgetOffice on H.R. 1838, the ``Taiwan Security En-hancement Act.'' This estimate was not avail-able on October 28, 1999, when the Com-mittee on International Relations filed its reporton would emphasize the security re- lationship between the United States andTaiwan. Specifically, the bill would author-ize an increase in the technical staff at theAmerican Institute in Taiwan, and would re-quire the Administration to report on Tai-wan's defense needs, its security situation,and the United States' ability to respond tocontingencies in the Asia-Pacific region.Also, the bill would require the Administra-tion to enhance the opportunities for train- ing and exchanges of Taiwanese officers atU.S. military schools and academies. CBO es-timates that enacting the bill would have nosignificant budgetary effect. According to the Department of Defense (DoD), implementing H.R. 1838 would not re-quire any additional staff because DoD hasalready increased the number of technicalstaff at the American Institute in Taiwanduring the last year. CBO estimates that pre-paring the required reports would not in-crease costs significantly, and any additionalofficer training and exchanges would be paidin full by Taiwan. The funds for training andexchanges would flow through the foreignmilitary sales trust fund\u00d0a direct spendingaccount. Because the bill could affect directspending, pay-as-you-go procedures wouldapply; however, CBO estimates that the neteffect of any increase in collections and out-lays would not be significant. H.R. 1838 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act and wouldnot affect the budgets of state, local, or trib-al governments. The estimate was prepared by Joseph C. Whitehill. The estimate was approved byPeter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Direc-tor for Budget Analysis. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SHOULD RAISE CAMPAIGNS TOHIGHER LEVEL OF TRUTHFUL-NESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. S CAR- BOROUGH ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. Mr. Speaker, I know many Americans and also anawful lot of people in Washington, D.C.,are focusing intently on what is goingon in New Hampshire, not only tonightbut over the past several weeks. We areobviously in the midst of a presidentialprimary season. It is very exciting towatch the democratic process playingitself out seeing who is going to beelected the next President of this greatrepublic. It has not been too surprising to see the differences between the Republicanand the Democratic Party. The Repub-licans obviously have five or six con-servative candidates whose fight main-ly centers around who wants to cuttaxes more, who wants to cut the sizeand scope of this mammoth bureauc-racy, who wants to spend less and pro-mote greater freedoms for individualsacross the country. Likewise, it is not a surprise that the Democratic primary has been con-sumed by battles, a left-wing battle forthose swinging wildly for the most ex-treme elements of the Democratic left,whether it be in Iowa or New Hamp-shire. They are fighting for bigger govern- ment. They are fighting for highertaxes, fighting for Federal funding ofabortion on demand, not only here butalso across the globe, and they are alsofighting for socializing medicine, thesame schemes that were rejected in1994 by Americans. Now, that is also not a surprise to most observers. But what is surprising,I think, to many observers have been the exploits of the Democratic frontrunner, Albert Gore. I say it is sur-prising because he has shown a remark- able disregard for telling the truth inhis campaign battle against SenatorBradley. In the USA Today today, Walter Sha- piro, who is a regular columnist whowrites ``Hype and Glory,'' wrote this: ``To tell the truth, Al Gore is having trouble out there. There he goes again.Al Gore simply can't help himself.With his veracity challenged by BillBradley and questioned in recent newsstories, Gore might have been expectedto use his major campaign event Sun-day to end the final weekend before theNew Hampshire primary on a highnote. Instead, the Vice President,stretching truth as if he were com-peting in a taffy pull, went after Brad-ley with the kind of rhetorical overkillthat made . . . Ted Kennedy standingnext to Gore seem like Caspar Milque-toast.'' ``Speaking to both passionate sup- porters and still-wavering undecidedvoters, Gore dispensed with any pre-tense of subtlety in his new super-herorole . . . Gore used the word `fight' times in roughly a 20-minute speech. . . But what was the most stunningabout the Gore speech was not theRocky imagery, but unabashed andunashamed mendacity.'' Shapiro goes on to say, ``Remember, Gore is the same candidate who in-sisted in Wednesday night's debatethat, `There has never been a time inthis campaign that I have said some-thing that I know to be untrue.''' Sha-piro went on to say either G ORE, ``in both his Gingrich and abortion com-ments, enjoys a very permissive defini-tion of `untrue' or else his judgment ishighly suspect if he actually believeshis own over-the-top claims.'' And I am quoting still from Shapiro in USA Today: ``The Boston Globe dis-closed Friday that during Gore's campaign in 1988,his press secretary . . the can-didate in memo, `Your pitfall isexaggeration.' This character flaw, thisrelentless willingness to prevaricateand demonize his opponents, mighthave been barely excusable in a youngSenator making a premature run forthe White House. But,'' in the words ofShapiro, ``it is deeply troubling in asenior statesman who has served twoterms as Vice President.'' Walter Shapiro concludes by talking about how Bill Bradley has been tryingto elevate the Democratic primary,whether one agrees with some of themost liberal tenets in his platform ornot. ``But if politics is ever again to be-come a higher moral calling than, say,commodities trading or running a tal-ent agency in Hollywood, then can-didates must be held responsible forthe tenor and the truthfulness of theircampaigns. And that means you, Mr.Vice President.'' Mr. Speaker, I have got to say, I was struck not only by the timing of thisarticle, because I was absolutely VerDate 27-JAN-2000 03:04 stunned yesterday when A LGORE, cam- paigning in New Hampshire, criticizedBill Bradley for injecting Willie Hortoninto the New Hampshire primary, whenall Mr. Bradley was saying was that itwas Mr. G OREand not George Bush who injected Willie Horton into the cam-paign in 1988. And so then the VicePresident turns around and attacksBill Bradley for telling the Americanpeople who first introduced Americansto Willie Horton. Likewise, he criticized Mr. Bradley for hurting the pro-choice movementfor pointing out the fact that Mr. G ORE has been extraordinarily inconsistenton the issue of pro-choice. I certainlyhope that he and all other candidates,Republicans and Democrats, can raisethis campaign to a higher level. MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 1999, the gentleman from Illi-nois (Mr. W ELLER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the major-ity leader. Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, this is a great opportunity this evening to talkabout an issue that many of us haveraised in this Congress over the lastseveral years. That is an issue thatreally is a fundamental issue of fair-ness, an issue of fairness that theAmerican people have been askingsome pretty basic questions about overthe last several years. I represent the south side of Chicago, the south suburbs in Cook and WillCounties, as well as bedroom commu-nities and farm communities in Illi-nois. And I found, whether I was in thesteel workers union hall in Hegwish ora neighborhood in Chicago or at thelocal legion post in Joliet or the localgrain elevator in Tonica, people oftenask a basic question: Is it right, is itfair that under our Tax Code that theaverage married working couple payshigher taxes just because they are mar-ried? They say why do the folks inWashington allow a Tax Code to be inplace that tells us that if we choose toget married and work, we are going topay more in taxes? Mr. Speaker, they are stunned when they learn that 28 million marriedworking couples pay an average $1,400more in higher taxes just because theyare married. Clearly, the marriage tax penalty suffered by working married people isfundamentally wrong and somethingwe should change. I am so pleased thatthe leadership of this House, theSpeaker of the House, the gentlemanfrom Illinois (Mr. H ASTERT ), has made reduction and elimination of the mar-riage tax penalty the first priority thisyear. First out of the box and on a fasttrack as a tax-related initiative to helpmiddle-class families. The marriage tax penalty has been in place for almost 30 years, and no onehas gone back to fix it. I am pleasedthis Republican Congress has made adecision to bring fairness to the Tax Code by working to eliminate the mar-riage tax penalty. The marriage tax penalty is some- thing that affects real people. I have aphoto here of a young couple from Jo-liet, Illinois, Shad and MichelleHallihan, two school teachers. Theyteach in the local public schools in Jo-liet. Shad and Michelle suffer a mar-riage tax penalty of almost a thousanddollars because they are married. Theyrecently had a child, a baby. And asMichelle Hallihan pointed out to me,she said that $1,000 the marriage taxpenalty that they suffer, that is 3,000diapers that they can buy for theirchild that goes to Uncle Sam instead oftaking care of their child. It is realmoney. Mr. Speaker, $1,400 in Joliet, Illinois, where Shad and Michelle live is oneyear's tuition at Joliet CommunityCollege, and it is 3 months of day careat a local day care center. Let me explain how it came about. Our Tax Code has grown more com-plicated and since the late 1960s, mar-ried working couples, moms and dads,husbands and wives with two incomeshave paid higher taxes just becausethey are married. Of course, we havemade this a priority, and I would liketo announce, of course, this Wednes-day, the Committee on Ways andMeans is going to be marking up, com-mittee action will occur on legislationessentially to wipe out the marriagetax penalty for almost 28 million mar-ried work couples. A real change thatis going to help people. Mr. Speaker, this is how the mar- riage tax penalty works. Take a ma-chinist and a school teacher in thesouth suburbs of Chicago. They haveidentical incomes. This machinist ismaking $31,500 as a single person.Under our Tax Code, he is going to betaxed at 15 percent rate. So he meets aschool teacher, a gal with an identicalincome of $31,500, and they choose toget married. And at the point theychoose to get married, they begin filingtheir taxes jointly. When we file our taxes jointly, we combine our two incomes. In this case,this machinist and school teacher whopreviously were taxed at 15 percent, be-cause they chose to get married, theircombined income pushes their com-bined income to $63,000. They pay al-most $1,400 more in higher taxes be-cause they are pushed, under our TaxCode, into the 28 percent tax bracket,the higher tax bracket. That is wrong,but today that is the current situationfor working married couples. So, real-ly, the incentives is in the wrong place.Marriage is one of the most basic insti-tutions in our society, and our TaxCode punishes marriage. I would point out that had this ma- chinist and school teacher chose to livetogether outside of marriage, theywould not suffer that extra tax. Onlywhen they choose to get married dothey pay that higher tax. And I thinkwe all agree, that is wrong that we im-pose higher taxes on married working people. I am proud to say that the House Re- publican leadership, under the leader-ship of Speaker Hastert, has madeelimination of the marriage tax pen-alty our first initiative in an effort tobring fairness to the Tax Code andlower the tax burden on working fami-lies. This afternoon, the gentlemanfrom Texas (Mr. A RCHER ) unveiled the legislation that will provide tax relieffor 28 million married working couples.It is similar, almost identical in manyways, to the Marriage Tax EliminationAct, H.R. 6, legislation that we intro-duced earlier this year which now has230 cosponsors, and overwhelming ma-jority of Republicans; and I am pleasedthat 12 Democrats have joined with usin an effort to make this a bipartisanproposal. Mr. Speaker, let me briefly share what the proposal that we will beworking on in the Committee on Waysand Means on Wednesday will do. It isthe goal of the House to act and ap-prove and send to the Senate by Feb-ruary 14, Valentine's Day, our effort towipe out the marriage tax penalty. Think about it. What better Valen- tine's Day gift to give 28 million mar-ried working people than eliminationof the marriage tax penalty. This legis-lation will essentially wipe out themarriage tax penalty for almost every-body who suffers it. That will be a bigchange in our Tax Code. The legislation that we will be acting on and voting out of the House in thenext couple of weeks will help 28 mil-lion married working couples. Forthose who do not itemize their taxes,they will see immediately $230 dollarsin marriage tax relief. For those whoitemize because they own a home, theywill see $1,400 marriage tax relief underthis legislation. I would point out that this makes a big difference. Under our plan, we pro-vide immediate marriage tax relief in2001, next year, helping millions of cou-ples. And because we double the stand-ard deduction for those who do notitemize for joint filers to twice that ofsingles, 3 million married working cou-ples will see their Tax Code simplifiedbecause they will no longer need toitemize and fill out extra forms. So wemake filing for taxes easier. And for those who do itemize, pri- marily homeowners, they will see mar-riage tax relief as well. Twenty-eightmillion married work couples will seeup to $1,400 in marriage tax relief as aresult of what the Committee on Waysand Means will approve on Wednesday,and I expect that an overwhelming ma-jority of this House will see it approvedbefore Valentine's Day. What a greatValentine's Day gift that we can give28 million married working couples,elimination of the marriage tax pen-alty. 1915 I am joined by a number of my col- leagues today who have been real lead- ers in the effort to eliminate the mar-riage tax penalty. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 January 31, 2000 As I pointed out earlier, of the 435 Members of this House, we need 217 topass a bill. So an overwhelming major-ity of the House have joined in cospon-soring this bill. I am joined today by anumber of cosponsors of this legisla-tion who have stepped forward andfought hard to eliminate the marriagetax penalty. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield to the gentlewoman fromIllinois (Mrs. B IGGERT ). I appreciate her participating in today's specialorder. Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. I would like to commend my col- league from Illinois (Mr. W ELLER ) for his dedication and commitment to theissue of the marriage tax penalty thatwe are discussing here tonight. Mr. Speaker, certainly the Federal Government taxes work, savings, in-vestment, entrepreneurship, risk tak-ing, creativity, ingenuity, even death.And you name it, Washington taxes it;and sometimes Washington taxes ittwice or three times. So it should comeas no surprise that the Federal Govern-ment taxes marriage. That is right: 28 million working American couples pay higher taxessimply because they are married. TheTax Code punishes working couples bypushing them into a higher tax brack-et, effectively taxing the income of thesecond wage earner at a much higherrate than if he or she were taxed onlyas an individual. We are not talking about pennies, ei- ther. These families pay an average of$1,400 more in taxes. This is moneythat could be used to buy a familycomputer, improve their homes, orsave for their children's education. For years, Republicans, led by my colleague from Illinois (Mr. W ELLER ), have led the fight to eliminate themarriage penalty. A bipartisan major-ity of the House supports his legisla-tion to do away with the marriage pen-alty. We included it in our tax reliefbill last year. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that bill and the significant marriagepenalty relief it provided. Now we hearfrom the President that he wants toprovide marriage penalty relief. I thinkthat is great, and I think we would wel- come his support. So next month, whenthe House passes the significant mar-riage penalty relief for the second timein the 106th Congress, and I think it isa great idea to have that on February14, Valentine's Day, when we pass thatin the House, the President will havethe opportunity to prove that his sup-port is more than the State of theUnion talk. There is no way around it. The Tax Code attacks one of society's mostbasic institutions, marriage. So withthe President and the Congress inagreement on the need to provide mar-riage penalty relief, now is the time toback up our words with action andbring tax equity for working families. So, again, I commend my colleague from the district right next to mine forthe work that he has done. I think it is important to note that the bill thatwill be before the House Committee onWays and Means will provide evenmore benefits and actually improvesthe bill that has been before us beforein that it will provide relief in a short-er time and more relief. This is an areathat we have been working on for solong. Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, reclaim- ing my time, I want to thank my friendand colleague from Illinois (Mrs.B IGGERT ) for her leadership and efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. In suburban districts like my col- league from Illinois, we have manyhomeowners; and one of the provisionsthat is so important in our legislationthat the committee will be acting onon Wednesday and the House voting onaround Valentine's Day is that we helpthose who itemize who suffer the mar-riage tax penalty, as well. If they own a home and they have to pay mortgage interest and they payproperty taxes and they combine thosetwo, that usually causes them toitemize their taxes. So I appreciatevery much her leadership. One other area I would like to point out that is so important about the leg-islation that we will be acting on inthe Committee on Ways and Means andthe House voting on within the next 2weeks is that we help 28 million mar-ried working couples, and also we helpthose poor families, working families,who participate in earned income taxcredit by working to offset a marriagetax credit that they suffer, as well. Solow-income families and low-incomeworking families benefit from the leg-islation that we are passing, as well. Another thing I would like to point out is that people often say, if theHouse moves quickly and the House isreally showing leadership on this, isthe Senate going to act on it, too? Iwould like to point out, too, thatChairman R OTHof the Senate Finance Committee today praised the gen-tleman from Texas (Chairman A RCHER ) for the speedy start of the House inthis effort to eliminate the marriagetax penalty and that he intends tomove similar legislation in the comingmonths. That is good news because we want to make elimination of the marriage taxpenalty our top priority first out of thebox and on a fast track to help 28 mil-lion married working couples. Mr. Speaker, I see the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. G UTKNECHT ), my friend, who has been a tremendousleader here on this effort to eliminatethe marriage tax penalty and who isone of the first ones to say this issomething that the House needs to do.I want to thank him for that. I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. G UTKNECHT ). Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois foryielding. The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. W ELLER ) and I came together in theClass of '94, and there were a number of things that we learned when we firstcame here. First of all, we had thishuge budget deficit that we were wres-tling with, $240-plus billion. When we first came here, the Con- gressional Budget Office told us afterthe President submitted his first budg-et that we would see deficits of over$200 billion as far as the eye could see. There were a number of problems here in Washington. One of the firstthings we did is that we said we aregoing to make Washington live by thesame laws as everybody else and sothat Congress is no longer exemptwhen we pass new laws. We balanced that budget. We re- formed the welfare system. And todayover half of the people who were receiv-ing welfare checks 5 years ago are nowreceiving payroll checks. We made atremendous contribution, and I thinkwe have moved the country in the rightdirection. This is just the next install-ment of the Republican agenda. I was surprised to learn how many people in America were paying extrataxes just because they were married.That is just not bad tax policy; that isnot just bad family policy. At the endof the day there is something almostfundamentally immoral for us as aFederal Government to say they aregoing to pay extra taxes just becausethey have a marriage license. That isbad policy, and we are finally in a posi-tion where we can stop it. I want to remind my colleagues and others who may be watching this thatif they would just like to check andsee, if they have got a married couplewhere they are both working, bothearning approximately the same in-come, and I think the example of mycolleague is a good one, I was in severalschools in the last couple of weeks inmy district talking with teachersabout education policy and otherthings, but it was interesting howmany times the issue of the marriagepenalty came up in my conversationswith teachers. The reason is that there are an awful lot of teachers who are married to eachother and they pay this marriage pen-alty. And so we have set up on our Website and if people would go to``gil.house.gov'' there is a calculatorthere and they can do a quick calcula-tion. Now, it is not exactly IRS ap-proved, but it will give them a veryclose calculation of what they are pay-ing currently in terms of extra taxesjust because they are married. So if any of my colleagues would like to check that, they can go to my Website, I think some other Members haveit on their Web sites as well, but``gil.house.gov'' and they can actuallyfind out how much of a penalty inextra taxes they may be paying simplybecause they have a wedding license.Bad tax policy. Bad family policy. Andas far as I am concerned, fundamen-tally immoral. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. W ELLER ) VerDate 27-JAN-2000 January 31, 2000 for his leadership. And I want to re- mind people that we are going to con-tinue to do the hard work of balancingthe budget, of saving Social Security,of paying down debt, and providing realtax relief for working families. Theyare not mutually exclusive. One of the other issues that I have been pushing and I know my colleaguehas as well is that we are going to takethese things one thing at a time. Lastyear we had a very good tax bill. It was$692 billion. But unfortunately I thinkin the eyes of a lot of Americans, 692billion is sort of an amorphous thing.And so, this year we are going to tack-le these issues one at a time as the re-sources, as the surpluses actually de-velop. We are going to take the marriage penalty tax first. I would hope thenvery shortly afterwards as we developmore surpluses as the revenues come inthat we would take a serious look atthe death tax. And if we cannot elimi-nate it, let us at least simplify it andmake the system fair. Because, again, Ithink it is fundamentally immoral tohave a 55 percent tax rate, a tax ratethat quickly escalates to 55 percent.That is confiscatory and, as I say, it isfundamentally immoral. So there are some other things we need to tackle in this year, and I thinkwe are going to demonstrate early onthat we are going to continue to do thehard work of balancing budgets, of sav-ing Social Security, of actually payingdown some of that national debt, andat the same time providing significantand important tax relief for thoseworking families out there who workso hard every week. We know, at theend of the day, those families knowhow to spend this money a whole lotsmarter than bureaucrats here inWashington. So I just wanted to rise and speak in strong support for this bill and do whatwe can to work through the process toget it through the House, get itthrough the Senate, and get it to thePresident's desk. Because I am con-vinced we are going to have over-whelming majorities on both sides ofthe political aisle here in the Houseand as well as the Senate; and I thinkthat, at the end of the day, the Presi-dent will sign this bill and very sooncouples like this one will not have topay extra taxes just because they aremarried. Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, reclaim- ing my time, I thank the gentlemanfrom Minnesota (Mr. G UTKNECHT ) for his leadership and for his participationtonight in explaining the marriage taxpenalty, what it is and why it is wrongand what we are going to do about it. I look back, in listening to my col- league's comments, to 5 years agowhen he and I were elected as part ofthe Class of 1994; and if we think aboutit back then, think of the issues thatwere facing us. Congress and the Presi-dent had just imposed the biggest taxincrease in the history of this countryon the American people, putting thetax burden at the highest level it had ever been in peacetime history. TheFederal Government was looking at$200 billion to $300 billion in deficitspending for the foreseeable future.More children were living in povertythan ever before. There was a rogueIRS running amuck amongst familiesand small business. We brought about some fundamental changes during the last 5 years. We bal-anced the budget for the first time in28 years. We cut taxes for the middleclass for the first time in 16 years. Andin the State I represent, in Illinois, 3million Illinois children now benefitfrom that $500-per-child tax credit thatwas part of our middle-class tax relief. Remember all those times we were told time and time again that it wasradical, it was crazy, how can you bal-ance the budget and cut taxes at thesame time? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would continue to yield,I think the comment was that, if yougo ahead with these reckless tax cuts,lowering capital gains tax rates, re-member, we were going to lower thetop capital gains tax rate from 28 per-cent to 20 percent. That represents a30-percent cut. And some of our col-leagues on the left said, well, you aregoing to blow a hole in the budget. Iwonder how many times we heard thatexpression. Well, the interesting thing is we low- ered the capital gains tax rate, and wehave actually seen more revenue com-ing into the Federal Government. Asmore people convert assets that are notproducing the way they want to intoother assets, they recognize that gain,they pay the taxes. When you increaseeconomic activity, you increase rev-enue to the Federal Government. Whenyou allow people to keep more of theirown money, revenue to the FederalGovernment goes up because theyspend that money, and it gets recycledthrough the private economy. Here again is one classic example. This marriage penalty is the next biglog that is going to fall. And this willbe a tremendous victory. I was sur-prised to learn, 28 million Americancouples paying a penalty of an averageof $1,400. We have made tremendous progress. There is still a lot to be done, but weare not going to give up with just this.This will be the next step. As we go for-ward, I think more and more Ameri-cans will see that this will benefit notonly a lot of working families but itwill benefit the economy as well. Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, reclaim- ing my time, as the gentleman fromMinnesota (Mr. G UTKNECHT ) pointed out, there has been fundamentalchange over the last 5 years, balancingthe budget, cutting taxes for the mid-dle class. We, of course, passed welfarereform into law, the first real welfarereform in a generation. In my homeState of Illinois, we have seen a 50-per-cent, one-half of our welfare roles havebeen cut in half as a result of welfarereform. We reformed the Internal Rev- enue Service, shifting the burden ofproof off the backs of taxpayers ontothe IRS. That is a fundamental change. We also did something this past year that was very much in response towhat I hear from the folks back homein Illinois. We stopped the raid on So-cial Security. For the first time in 30years, we balanced the budget withoutspending one dime of Social Security,setting aside $137 billion of Social Se-curity for Social Security and Medi-care, a big fundamental change. I am also asked about what are peo- ple doing about paying down the na-tional debt. We have paid down $350 bil-lion of the national debt. We are goingto adopt a budget later this year thatis going to eliminate the national debtover the next 13 to 15 to 20 years. Thatwill be another fundamental change. 1930 That is why I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.G OODLATTE ) who has been another real strong leader in our efforts to elimi-nate the marriage tax penalty and help28 million married working couples.When we think about that, 28 millionmarried working couples, that means56 million working Americans sufferhigher taxes just because they are mar-ried. I am happy to yield to the gen-tleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gen- tleman for yielding. I especially wantto thank and congratulate him for hiseffort in this matter. I know that hehas introduced, along with the gen-tleman from Indiana (Mr. M CINTOSH ) and the gentlewoman from Missouri(Ms. D ANNER ), a Democrat, H.R. 6 to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Iam pleased to be a cosponsor of thatlegislation along with the gentlemanfrom Minnesota and many others be-cause it is long overdue. As has already been noted, we at- tempted to do that in the tax packagethat we passed last year that was un-fortunately vetoed by the President.This time we are going to go back, putit right on the line and say that we aregoing to introduce a bill, produce a billthat simply eliminates the marriagetax penalty. For the last year and a half, I have discussed it at every single one of thedozens of town meetings that I haveconducted across my congressional dis-trict. Every time I bring this up, I canjust see everybody in the audience nod-ding their heads in agreement. They understand this issue. I use exactly theillustration that the gentleman fromIllinois referred to earlier and he hasprovided to other Members. I take thatto them. I say, you have a couple, eachearning $31,500 per year for a combinedincome of $63,000. If they are married,they will pay nearly $1,300 a year morethan the same two people with thesame two jobs living in the samehousehold with the same income. Peo-ple understand that that is totally con-trary to good public policy. It discour-ages marriage, it discourages people VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 January 31, 2000 from being forthright with their in- come and their taxes. We need to change that. Fairness is fairness. The American public under-stands this. Poll after poll has reflectedwhat each one of us knows from ourmeetings with our constituents as well. There was a recent poll by Wirthlin Worldwide that showed that 85 percentof Americans believe that the marriagetax penalty is unfair, and 80 percent ofthem favor the elimination of the mar-riage tax penalty. Eighty-nine percentof married women and 89 percent ofworking and married mothers areamong those who strongly believe thatthe marriage tax penalty is unfair. Andmore than two-thirds of all Americans,according to a Harris Poll, believe thatthe budget surplus should be used toeliminate or reduce the marriage taxpenalty. I think that this is something that the American people expect us to do. Itis a disappointment when we put for-ward an effort like that along withother very reasonable tax cuts directedat improving our economy, creatingmore jobs and helping hardworkingAmerican families who right now facethe highest level of taxation they haveever faced, to veto something like that.I am hopeful that this time we willhave the President's help in gettingreal, meaningful tax cuts in place here. If we look at the average American family, not wealthy people but the av-erage American family, when we addup what they pay in Federal, State andlocal taxes, it comes to about 40 per-cent of the average family's income.That is more than the average familyspends on food, clothing and sheltercombined. When we add on top of thata penalty for being married and havingboth members of the household havingto go out and work in order to supporttheir family, it is truly an outrage thatthis condition in our tax code has beenallowed to persist as long as it has. Iam pleased with the commitment ofour leadership to move this legislationforward. I know we will have bipartisansupport for it. It is my hope that wewill pass this legislation as quickly aspossible and get this tax relief to work-ing families as quickly as possible. Mr. WELLER. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his leadership and ef-forts on working to eliminate the mar-riage tax penalty. When we thinkabout it, $1,400 in Washington, D.C. is adrop in the bucket. There are alwaysthose, particularly on the far left sideof things, who think that we shouldkeep this money in Washington. Theythink that $1,400 really does not mattermuch back in Illinois or Minnesota orin Virginia; and, of course, that is real-ly nothing here when they spend bil-lions of dollars in the Congress. But letme just share with my colleagues what$1,400 means in the south suburbs, inthe south side of Chicago: $1,400 is 3 months of child care at a local day care center in Joliet, Illinois.It is a year at Joliet Junior College,our local community college, 1 year'scollege tuition. $1400, the average mar- riage tax penalty, is 4 months of carpayments for the average family. It isschool clothes for the kids. As MichelleHallihan pointed out, that $1,000 mar-riage tax penalty that Shad andMichelle Hallihan, two public schoolteachers in Joliet, Illinois, that theyhave to pay just because they are mar-ried, that $1,000 is 3,000 diapers for theirnewborn child. Of course it is a family vacation. It is a computer for the kids to help them intheir school. It is several months ofhealth insurance premiums. It is adown payment for many first-timehomebuyers on a home. It is also a ma-jority of the contribution to an IRA. Itis real money for real people. For somein Washington, it is no big deal. But forfolks in Minnesota and Virginia and Il-linois and all across this country, 56million married people, it is realmoney, $1,400, the average marriagetax penalty. Mr. GUTKNECHT. If the gentleman from Illinois will yield, it is inter-esting, we have had several of my staff-ers over the last couple of years whohave gotten married. In fact, we hadtwo people working on my staff whomarried each other. We did the calcula-tion for them. It was $1,400, an extra$1,400 in taxes that they were going tohave to pay that they would not havehad to pay if they would have simplylived together. We look at this wonderful picture of these two young people here and wethink principally about young peoplegetting married. But I was at a meet-ing with some seniors and one of themcame up to me with kind of a funnylook on his face and he said, ``I hopeyou do something about this marriagepenalty.'' I said, ``Really? Why?'' Hesaid, ``Well, I'm facing kind of an eth-ical dilemma myself as to whether ornot this woman I'm now seeing and Ishould get married, because we realizedwith our particular financial situa-tions, we're going to pay a penalty ofover a thousand dollars if we get mar-ried. It really puts us in sort of a moraldilemma because we know what theright thing to do is but the governmentshouldn't encourage you to do thewrong thing.'' As we look at the reforms that we have passed in the last 5 years, sincethe Republicans took control of thisplace, they really are about reversingwhat I think is one of the unwrittenrules of Washington, and, that is, nogood deed goes unpunished. That wasthe rule for many years in Washington.If you worked, you got punished. If yousaved, you got punished. If you in-vested, you were punished. If you triedto create jobs and create wealth, youwere punished, whether it was the EPAor the tax code or whatever. There was sort of this unwritten rule. In fact, it even applied to Medicare.Some of us know that live in morerural parts of the country that our hos-pitals get lower reimbursements be-cause they have lower cost hospitals.No good deed goes unpunished. This is one more example where we can strikea blow and say that unwritten rule ofWashington needs to end. It is not just about young people. It is about people of all ages. It is bad taxpolicy. We have a chance to eliminateit. I am delighted we are going to takethis tax issue one slice at a time, start-ing with the marriage penalty. Let usput them on the President's desk andlet him explain why if he thinks heshould not sign this bill. Because Ithink the American people are way outin front of us on this. Mr. GOODLATTE. If the gentleman will yield, I think the gentleman fromMinnesota is right on when he pointsout that this is not just for newlyweds,it is for anybody who is married at anytime in their life, for senior citizenswho may have lost their spouse and areconsidering remarrying and they havegot a whole host of questions to be an-swered about does it make sense to re-marry or not or should we just live to-gether, which I think is a real concernfor a lot of senior citizens. We shouldtake this issue off of the table forthem. They should feel like if the thingthat they need is to have a loved onesharing their home with them, thatthey can feel free to be married and notpay a $1,400 or more penalty. The other point to make here is that while there is a diverse array of peoplewho are benefited by this, one thing,the overwhelming majority of themhave in common and that is that theseare middle class and lower middle-in-come people in our country who arebenefitting from this overwhelmingly.The vast majority of people are wherethe larger wage earner of the two is be-tween $20,000 a year and $75,000 a year. So we are talking about people who are working hard and needing every bitof the money that they earn in order tomeet all of their obligations that theyhave in raising children and payingrent and putting food on the table andso on. This is something that reallyreaches out to people across all acrossAmerica. I think it is overwhelminglyof benefit to, as I say, hardworkingAmerican families who are pressed intothat category of spending an average of40 percent of their income on taxes.They do not feel like they are getting40 percent back of all that hard work inthe form of benefits for those taxescompared to what they get for food andclothing and shelter that they spendless on than they spend on those taxes. Mr. WELLER. The gentleman from Virginia made a good point. The mar-riage tax penalty is an issue that isfaced by average, middle class Ameri-cans. If you pay the average marriagetax penalty, you make about $62,000 ayear in combined income, between twohardworking Americans, husband andwife, joined together in marriage whounder our tax code they file, they filejointly when they are married, are nowpaying the marriage tax penalty. It isvery much a middle class issue. Ofcourse, a proposal that we are going to VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 Feb January 31, 2000 be acting on in the Committee on Ways and Means on Wednesday and theHouse voting on by Valentine's Day, ofcourse, will also help low-income fami-lies as well. As I pointed out, we are working to address the marriage tax penalty, butfor those who participate in the earnedincome credit, a program to help par-ticularly families with children makeends meet, those who work hard, havelow incomes and ensure that they havegot enough to get by to take care ofthe kids' and their families' needs. Weare not only working to help the mid-dle class but we are also helping lowerincome working families as well withthis initiative this House is going tovote on. Mr. GUTKNECHT. If the gentleman will yield, we are probably going tohear from some of our friends on theleft that if we provide this tax relief, itis going to mean that there is going tobe less money to spend on educationand health care and some other impor-tant things. But to paraphrase one ofour colleagues over in the Senate, theother body, he once observed that thisis not a debate about how much isgoing to be spent on children or edu-cation or health care, it is a debateabout who gets to do the spending. I know the family and I know the Federal Government, and I will bet onthe family every single time, becausethat couple which represents thoseother millions and millions of couplesaround the country, I have every con-fidence that they know how to spendtheir money smarter than Washingtondoes on their behalf. They are going tospend that money on children. Theyare going to spend that money on edu-cation. They are going to spend thatmoney on health care. They are goingto spend that money on making certainthat their family's needs are met. As our colleague from Virginia indi- cated earlier, right now in Americatoday, this is a shocking statistic, thatthe average family spends more ontaxes, we are talking about State, Fed-eral and local but in total taxes, thataverage family spends more for taxesthan they do for food, clothing andshelter combined. There is somethingwrong in America today when the taxcollector takes first interest on all themoney that families earn. This is just one very small, well, not small, this is one major but very im-portant step that we can strike on be-half of American families around thecountry. Again, I congratulate the gen-tleman from Illinois, I congratulatethe leadership in this Congress. I do be-lieve that it is going to pass over-whelmingly on a bipartisan vote andthen go to the Senate. I think some people are going to throw out the thing, well, it is going toblow a hole in the budget. That is nottrue. If we control Federal spending,there is more than enough money tobalance the budget, make certain thatevery penny of Social Security taxesgoes only for Social Security, there ismore than enough money to begin to really pay down that debt, and there ismore than enough money to make cer-tain that American families are treat-ed fairly. That is really what this is allabout. Mr. WELLER. The gentleman point- ed out something that is so true. Thatis, that this year as we work to balancethe budget for the fourth year in a row,we are going to be adopting a plan thatonce again sets aside 100 percent of So-cial Security for Social Security,walling off the Social Security trustfund so it cannot be used for anythingelse, stopping the raid on Social Secu-rity. Again which is one of the Repub-lican priorities. We are also going to, of course, strengthen our schools; and we aregoing to pay down the national debt.But as we work to address the issue offairness in the tax code, I find in thesouth side of Chicago and in the southsuburbs that I have the privilege ofrepresenting in Illinois, people say,``My tax burden is too high.'' Theypoint out that 40 percent of the averageIllinois family's income goes to govern-ment in Washington, in the State cap-ital, the local courthouse, of course inlocal, State and Federal taxes and thatit is the highest tax burden in peace-time history. Only at the end of World War II has our tax burden on our Nation beenhigher than it is today. They complainabout that. They are unhappy that thistax burden is so high. They are frus-trated because they feel they can bet-ter spend those dollars. The other pointthey always make to me is they arefrustrated about how complicated andunfair the tax code is. They think it iswrong that under our tax code that 28million married working couples payhigher taxes just because they are mar-ried. 1945 That is wrong. Think about it, $1,400, one year's college tuition. The gen-tleman from Minnesota also broughtup another point. It is not just youngcouples, like Shad and MichelleHallihan, but it is older Americans, re-tirees; and they have two pensions thatthey are collecting, and with their twopensions they are paying a marriagetax penalty. If you think about it, those in their later years, health care costs are high-er for them at that time, they are con-cerned about prescription drugs, andone of the priorities for this Repub-lican Congress this year is passing aprescription drug benefit under Medi-care that takes care of those 15 millionseniors who do not have prescriptiondrug coverage. Well, by eliminating the marriage tax penalty for senior citizens who suf-fer it, they will have more of their ownmoney to keep to meet their ownneeds, rather than going to Wash-ington. It is just wrong. We have all heard the story about the elderly couple that decided to get di-vorced because they found they could save money. That is wrong, that underour Tax Code, the incentives are to getdivorced, rather than to get married,or not to get married in the first place.We want to strengthen families in ourcountry, and that is why elimination ofthe marriage tax penalty is so impor-tant. I would be happy to yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Just in closing, Congressman W ELLER , I wanted to again thank you, because there are twoissues that you have worked very hardto help reinforce that I think are sortof the mortar between the bricks thatholds our whole culture and society to-gether. First of all, strong marriages, be- cause we know that societies that havestrong families are societies that needless government, they need less policeprotection, they need less in terms ofcriminal apprehension, they need lessin terms of other social safety nets, ifyou will. So strong families are impor-tant, and this is one very importantstep to reinforce those. The other area you have worked so hard on, and that is home ownership.The one thing we know is that soci-eties that have strong families and ahigh level of home ownership arestrong societies. So I want to congratulate the gen- tleman on both of those fronts. I hopethe Committee on Ways and Means willreport out a strong bill in the next sev-eral days that we can have on the floorand get at the President's desk by Val-entine's Day. I think that is a fantasticgift to give those millions of Americancouples. Again, I thank the gentleman for his leadership and look forward to workingas best we can to make certain thatthis one unfairness in the Tax Code iseliminated this year. Mr. WELLER. Again, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Min-nesota for his comments, and his lead-ership. The gentleman from Minnesota(Mr. G UTKNECHT ) has been a real lead- er, one of the original leaders in our ef-fort to eliminate the marriage tax pen-alty, one of the items of unfinishedbusiness that we have decided underthe leadership this year of HouseSpeaker D ENNIS HASTERT to make first out of the box, put on a fast track, tohelp families by addressing the need tomake our Tax Code more fair and moresimple, and we will benefit 56 millionworking Americans who will benefit byeliminating the marriage tax penalty. We have often asked over the last several years as House Republicanshave worked to eliminate the marriagetax penalty, is it right, is it fair thatunder our Tax Code that 28 millionmarried working couples pay more intaxes just because they are married. The average marriage tax penalty is $1,400 in higher taxes just because theyare married. In the south side of Chi-cago, the south suburbs and rural com-munities that I represent in Illinois, VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 31, 2000 $1,400 is one year's tuition at the local community college; it is three monthsof daycare at the local daycare center;it is 3,000 diapers for a newborn baby ifthey suffer the marriage tax penalty. I am so proud that this House has made it a priority once again. I wasdisappointed, in fact it broke my heartlast year when President Clinton andVice President Gore vetoed our effortsto eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We sent to the President legislation which would wipe out the marriage taxpenalty for a majority of those whosuffer it. Unfortunately, because it waspart of a package with a number ofother initiatives, the President vetoedit. He said he wanted to spend themoney on other things. Unfortunately,it fell victim to his desire to createnew government programs. We believe, and our hope is, this year the President will join with us. Hementioned in the State of the Unionthe other night the need to address themarriage tax penalty. We want to takehim at his word. He has now made apromise, and we want him to keep it.We are going to eliminate the marriagetax penalty. When you think about it, that $1,400 we are going to allow the average mar-ried couple to keep, that is going to bea big help to the folks back home. Webelieve that by sending the Presidentstand-alone clean marriage tax elimi-nation legislation, legislation thatonly has one item in it, which is our ef-fort to eliminate the marriage tax pen-alty, that we will help 28 million work-ing married couples, because it shouldreceive overwhelming bipartisan sup-port. As I pointed out earlier, an over- whelming majority, almost 220 Repub-licans are cosponsoring the MarriageTax Elimination Act, about a dozenDemocrats. Hopefully more Democratswill join with us, because I believe ourlegislation that will move out of theCommittee on Ways and Means thisWednesday will pass with over-whelming bipartisan support, and I be-lieve that that signal that will be sentto the Senate will, of course, help theSenate maintain the discipline to movea bill quickly through the Senate toeliminate the marriage tax penalty;and, of course, then we can send it tothe President, helping 28 million work-ing married couples. Frankly, what better gift to give 28 million married working couples onValentine's Day than passage of legis-lation out of this House, which wipesout the marriage tax penalty for 28million married working couples. Let me again explain what the mar- riage tax penalty is for all those thatare interested. And for my friends inthe House I would like to point out,you know, the marriage tax penalty isa middle-class issue. It is a workingfamily issue, because if you are a mar- ried couple and you work, you paytaxes, and if you are married, you payhigher taxes under our Tax Code. In Joliet, Illinois, I will give you an example of a machinist and a school-teacher. A machinist who works at Caterpillar, they make big heavyequipment, those big tractors and bull-dozers in Joliet, and the machinistthat works there, he makes $31,500. As a single person this machinist at Caterpillar, at the Joliet Caterpillarplant, he pays at the 15 percent taxrate. He pays taxes at the most basicrate for average Americans, which is 15percent. It is the lowest bracket in ourTax Code. But if he meets a schoolteacher with an identical income, a tenured school-teacher with an identical income,$31,500, of course, she pays in the 15percent bracket if she stays single andis single, but if this machinist andschoolteacher in Joliet, Illinois, decideto get married, they have to file joint-ly, which means they have to combinetheir incomes. Under our Tax Code today, this ma- chinist and schoolteacher in Joliet, Il-linois, they are pushed into the 28 per-cent tax bracket, and under our TaxCode, they pay almost $1,400 more inhigher taxes just because they chose toget married. Now, if they chose not to get married and made the choice of living together,they would not pay that marriage taxpenalty; or if they were married andchose to get divorced, they would savemoney. Those incentives are just in thewrong place. Now, under the proposal that the Committee on Ways and Means is goingto act on on Wednesday, we are goingto help this machinist in Joliet, Illi-nois, and this public schoolteacher inJoliet, Illinois, because we are going topass legislation out of the Committeeon Ways and Means and out of thisHouse by Valentine's Day which willessentially wipe out the marriage taxpenalty; and for couples, such as thismachinist and schoolteacher, they willno longer be punished for being mar-ried with passage of our legislationthat we are going to move out of theHouse the next couple of weeks. What we do is we double the standard deduction immediately so that jointfilers have a standard deduction twicethat for single filers. Now, if youitemize your taxes, and most peoplewho itemize their taxes are home-owners and you itemize because youcombine your property taxes with yourmortgage interest, and if that totalsmore than the standard deduction, youitemize your taxes. But under our proposal that we are going to pass out of the House in thenext couple of weeks, we double thestandard deduction for joint filers totwice that of singles, so that wipes outthe marriage tax penalty for those whodo not itemize. We do that imme-diately in the year 2001, this comingyear. Next year we double the standarddeduction for those who do not itemize.So they are helped quite a bit. I would point out by doubling the standard deduction for joint filers totwice those of singles, we also simplifythe Tax Code, one of our other goals,because 3 million married working cou- ples will no longer need to itemizetheir taxes because we double thestandard deduction for joint filers totwice that of singles. So we simplifythe paperwork they are required to filewhen they file taxes on April 15th. Soit is a two-fer. We wipe out the mar-riage tax penalty, and we save themtime on their taxes. Now, for many homeowners, in fact, an awful lot of homeowners, particu-larly in the suburbs of Chicago andrural areas that I represent, theyitemize their taxes, because when youadd together your property taxes, youadd together your mortgage interestand some of the other items you mightbe able to itemize, charity deductions,they are more than the standard deduc-tion, so you itemize your taxes. Wehelp them as well. What we do in our proposal to help those who itemize their taxes in elimi-nating the marriage tax penalty is wewiden the 15 percent bracket. Rightnow if you are single, you can makeabout $24,000 or $25,000 a year and be inthe 15 percent tax bracket; but if youare married and you file jointly, youcan only make about $44,000 a year. That is wrong, because if you choose to get married, you pay higher taxesbecause of that. So we double it underthis legislation. We widen that bracketso those in the 15 percent bracket thatare joint filers can earn twice as muchin their combined income as single fil-ers, wiping out their marriage tax pen-alty as well. That is good news for mar-ried working couples. We help thosewho itemize; we help those who do notitemize. One of the other points I would like to make as well, I am often asked, ifyou are going to eliminate the mar-riage tax penalty, does that mean youare going to raise taxes on single peo-ple in order to offset the loss of rev-enue for the Federal Government? Well, we have addressed that issue. Under the legislation that the Com-mittee on Ways and Means is going toact on on Wednesday and this House isgoing to pass by Valentine's Day, wewipe out the marriage tax penalty foralmost 28 million married working cou-ples, and we make the Tax Code essen-tially neutral, so you pay no more intaxes if you are married or single, sotwo people with identical incomes inidentical circumstances pay no more intaxes if they are single or married. That is fairness, bringing fairness to the Tax Code, because it responds tothat fundamental question, and that is,is it right, is it fair that under our TaxCode that you pay more in taxes justbecause you are married. I am so pleased and really pretty proud that the House leadership underthe leadership of House Speaker D EN- NISHASTERT has made elimination of the marriage tax penalty priorityNumber 1 when it comes to addressingthe need to fix the Tax Code to make itfairer and simpler, and that we aregoing to give a Valentine's Day gift to VerDate 27-JAN-2000 January 31, 2000 28 million married working couples by passing out of this House by Valen-tine's Day our legislation which willessentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those whosuffer it. I often refer to this young couple that came and talked to me about theneed to eliminate the marriage taxpenalty and what it meant to them.Whenever we talk about the marriagetax penalty, I think of couples such asMichelle and Shad Hallihan, two publicschool teachers in Joliet, Illinois, whomade the decision to get married; andthey made that decision knowing fullwell that under our Tax Code they weregoing to pay more in taxes just becausethey are married. Well, it is young people like Michelle and Shad, as well as older folks whoare retirees who suffer the marriagetax penalty, that we want to bring fair-ness to the Tax Code by eliminatingthe marriage tax penalty. I really believe that this year we have an opportunity. Unfortunately,the President and Vice President Gorevetoed last year our efforts to elimi-nate the marriage tax penalty for avast majority of those who suffer it,and it fell victim to the President's de-sire to spend more money on govern-ment programs. And while we wantedto eliminate the marriage tax penalty,we made a commitment last year thatwe were going to try again. I am pleased that this House in the next 2 weeks is going to vote on legis-lation which will wipe out the mar-riage tax penalty for a majority ofthose that suffer it. That is good news.That is good news for 28 million mar-ried working couples. Fifty-six millionAmericans who are married and workwill benefit from this legislation, andthey will see anywhere from $230 to al-most $1,400 in marriage tax relief as aresult of this legislation. That is goodnews. My hope is this entire House will vote yes. Now, there are 12 Democratsthat have joined along with us, out ofthe 231 cosponsors of the Marriage TaxElimination Act. The gentlewomanfrom Missouri (Ms. D ANNER ) has been a real leader. My friend, a DemocraticMember from Missouri, has been a realleader in the effort to eliminate themarriage tax penalty, and I am soproud to have her as a partner, and shehas been able to bring about a dozen ofher Democratic colleagues with her. My hope is and we want to extend an invitation to our Democratic friends tojoin with us and make this a bipartisaneffort. The President said in his State of the Union speech the other night that weshould address the marriage tax pen-alty. We want to take the President athis word, so that when we place on thePresident's desk a stand-alone bill,clean marriage tax elimination legisla-tion, that he will sign it into law, be-cause it is going to provide real reliefand address the need to bring fairnessto the Tax Code when it comes to mar-riage.You know, you think about it, our Tax Code has the incentives in thewrong place. We should be working tostrengthen society's most basic insti-tution. We can do that by eliminatingthe marriage tax penalty. My hope is over the next 2 weeks we will be able to garner overwhelming bi-partisan support to send with a strongmessage to the Senate our desire toeliminate the marriage tax penalty. Iappreciate the comments of ChairmanR OTHof Delaware, who has been a real leader in working to bring tax relief formiddle-class families. Again, as I pointed out earlier, Chair- man R OTH, chairman of the Senate Fi- nance Committee, praised the gen-tleman from Texas (Chairman A RCHER ) for the speedy start to open this issue.Of course, Mr. A RCHER is chairman of the House Committee on Ways andMeans, part of our leadership here inthe House. Chairman R OTHindicated he intends to move shortly over the nextfew months similar legislation toeliminate the marriage tax penalty. Let us keep this legislation on a fast track. There are 28 million marriedworking couples, 56 million hard-work-ing married people that are out therewho need help. They need fairness inthe Tax Code as it affects married peo-ple. We want to help them. My belief is we have a tremendous opportunity, a clean stand-alone effortto eliminate the marriage tax penalty.It deserves overwhelming bipartisansupport. It deserves to be signed intolaw. It is all about fairness. Let us bring fairness to the Tax Code. Help couples such as Michelle and ShadHallihan, public school teachers in Jo-liet, as well as 28 million other workingcouples, by eliminating the marriagetax penalty. 2000 I thank the Speaker for the oppor- tunity to address this House and our ef-forts to eliminate the marriage taxpenalty and bring fairness to the TaxCode. PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 1999, the gentleman from NewJersey (Mr. P ALLONE ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the mi-nority leader. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would mention that I do not plan to use all ofthe time this evening that is allottedto me, but I do want to spend sometime talking about the Democratichealth care initiatives, particularly byreference to the President's State ofthe Union address last Thursday nightwhere he outlined many of the Demo-cratic health care initiatives, some ofwhich have already had debate andbeen discussed extensively by me andby other Members of this House, othersof which are somewhat new. I would start out by pointing out that the Democrats and myself, we feelvery strongly that the time has come to deal with three key health careissues. I do not say this because it isthe Democratic agenda; I say it be-cause I think it is America's agenda.These are the concerns and the prob-lems that need to be dealt with, that Ihear from my constituents in New Jer-sey in my congressional district, as well as from my colleagues here inWashington, D.C. on both sides of theaisle, when they come back, particu-larly from this 2-month period, thisdistrict work period or recess that wewere in, and a lot of us had forums, alot of us got input from our seniors,from our senior citizens, as well asfrom a lot of other people, and we arehere back fresh for the second sessionof this Congress but we need to addressthese health care concerns. Let me detail the three concerns that I have. First of all, it is time to passthe Patients' Bill of Rights, the HMOreform. We went for a year, the lastsession in 1999, trying to push the Pa-tients' Bill of Rights, and we finallydid get it passed in the House of Rep-resentatives, but it still has not passed,or a strong bill, I should say, has notpassed in the Senate. It is now in con-ference between the two Houses, be-tween the House of Representativesand the Senate, but we still have nothad a meeting of the conference so thatwe can move forward in trying to adoptgood HMO reform to deal with abusesof HMOs that are basically set forth inthe Patients' Bill of Rights. We need topass that. That is number one, and Iwill talk a little bit more about itlater. Number two, we need to address the problem of prescription drugs for sen-iors. Concerns about health care crossall generational lines and all class andincome lines, but for seniors in par-ticular the lack of a benefit underMedicare for prescription drugs, andthe majority of the seniors do not havethat kind of a benefit, is a particularproblem because when I am in my dis-trict, or the forums in my district of-fice, so many seniors call me or willcome up to me and some of them willsay they have prescription drug bene-fits but it is not sufficient, and thecosts continue to escalate and theysimply cannot afford it. So they eithergo without the drug or they take lessthan they are supposed to or they tryto spread it out in some way. This is not the way we should oper- ate. Prescription drugs are a preven-tive benefit that should be providedunder Medicare. Of course, the Presi-dent talked about that as well and Iwill talk a little bit about it tonight. The third health care issue, though, and concern that needs to be addressedis access for the uninsured. Since Ihave been a Member of Congress, andparticularly in the last 5 years, thenumber of Americans who are unin-sured who have no health insurancecontinues to skyrocket. It is about 45million Americans now that have nohealth insurance, and keep in mind VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 January 31, 2000 that these are pretty much middle class working people, because if youare poor enough to fall below a certainincome you are eligible for medicaid. Ifyou are a senior, regardless of income,you are over 65, you are eligible forMedicare, but if you are a working per-son whose income is just above the linefor medicaid and you are not a seniorcitizen then you do not have any guar-antee of health insurance. What is happening increasingly is a lot of people simply do not get healthinsurance as part of their employment. Years ago, most Americans, if they were working, their employer providedsome sort of health insurance wherethe employer would pay part of it andthe employee would pay part of it, butincreasingly that is not the case. So wehave about 45 million uninsured Ameri-cans, mostly working Americans, whosimply do not have the ability throughtheir job to get access to health insur-ance and we need to do somethingabout it. The President has addressedthat as well, and it is part of ourDemocratic agenda. Now, let me take these in order and spend some time on each of theseissues, if I can tonight, Mr. Speaker.First of all, I want to go back to HMOreform and the Patients' Bill of Rights.No one is suggesting that HMOs are abad thing. We know that in many casesHMOs have actually helped to bringdown the costs of health insurance.The bottom line is that there are manycases where there have been excesses orabuses within HMO networks, and of-tentimes that manifests itself in that aphysician will say to a particular pa-tient that they need a particular oper-ation or a length of stay in the hos-pital, or have to go to a particular pro-vider or particular hospital or spe-cialist for care. The HMO does not allow it, either be- cause there are certain types of oper-ations that the HMO just will not payfor or they will say that you can onlystay in the hospital a certain numberof days for a certain procedure eventhough your physician thinks that youneed to stay longer, and we have hadpeople actually become very ill, evendie, because of the denial of care inthose abusive situations. Well, we as Democrats put together a bill called the Patients' Bill of Rights.I am not saying that it is strictly aDemocratic bill. We had some Repub-licans that cosponsored the bill andcertainly some Republicans that votedfor the bill when it was passed here inthe House of Representatives, but un-fortunately the Republican leadershipin the House did not support the Pa-tients' Bill of Rights and they continueto create problems in terms of its goingto conference. We heard from the Republican lead- ership I think a week or two ago thatthey say now that they will hold a con-ference, but it has not been held yetand the problem is that the confereesthat the Republican leadership haveappointed to this conference, even if itis held, are not people that support the Patients' Bill of Rights. They are spe-cifically those who said that theywould not support the Patients' Bill ofRights. Well, what does the Patients' Bill of Rights do? Let me just give some indi-cation of what this is all about andhow it corrects some of the excesses orabuses with regard to HMOs. I amgoing to mention a few things with re-gard to access. One is emergency serv-ices. Individuals are assured under thePatients' Bill of Rights that if theyhave an emergency those services willbe covered by their plan. The bill saysthat individuals must have access to emergency care without prior author-ization in any situation that a prudentlayperson would regard as an emer-gency. So if you are the average guy and you feel that you have chest pains andthat you need to go to the hospital andthe emergency room because you thinkyou might be having a heart attack,well, that is the average or prudentlayperson. If you have to go to thenearest emergency room, even if theHMO says that that is not where yougo and that is not one of the hospitalsthat are covered, they have to pay be-cause it was an emergency. That iswhat the bill says. Specialty care, Mr. Speaker, under this bill patients with special condi-tions must have access to providerswho have the requisite expertise totreat their problem. The bill allows forreferrals for enrollees to go out of theplan's network for specialty care at noextra cost to the enrollee if there is noappropriate provider available in thenetwork for covered services. For indi-viduals who are seriously ill or requirecontinued care by a specialist, plansmust have a process for selecting a spe-cialist as a gatekeeper for their condi-tion to access necessary specialty carewithout impediments. So what we are saying here is if the HMO does not have a specialist thatyou need to handle your particular sit-uation, then they have to pay for youto go to another specialist, and if youhave the type of condition where youneed to go to a specialist on a regularbasis, you do not have to go to the pri- mary care physician for a referral tothat specialist every time. You just getbasically registered with a specialtydoctor and you continue to go to her orhim. Now those are some of the examples. I mean, there are a lot of others. Ithink one of the worst abuses that Iknow of is what they call the gag rule,where HMOs will write into their con-tract that if they do not provide a par-ticular operation or service your physi-cian cannot talk to you about it. In ef-fect, he or she, your physician, isgagged from telling you what kind ofprocedure or operation you really needbecause the HMO will not cover it. Well, that obviously needs to be eliminated. One of the provisions inour Patients' Bill of Rights says therecannot be any gag rules.Let me go into some of the other areas. I had a number of senior forumsin my district during the recess in De-cember and January and a lot of themcomplained about not having adequateinformation provided by the HMO, thatthey do not even know what is covered,they do not know what physicians arein the network, they do not know basi-cally what their insurance provides.Well, in the Patients' Bill of Rights, wesay that managed care plans have toprovide information so the consumersunderstand their health plan's policies,procedures, benefits and other require-ments. That may seem like it's not impor- tant, but I think it is very important.Also important, and I want to stress, isthe grievance and appeals procedure.Right now if an HMO turns you downfor a particular operation, how do youappeal that decision if you feel thatthat decision by the HMO was a wrongone? Well, with great difficulty, Ishould add. Oftentimes the HMO willhave you go to an internal reviewboard with members appointed fromtheir own staff and so when you appealyou have no chance. Well, what we sayin the Patients' Bill of Rights is thatthere has to be an internal appeal thatbasically is not influenced by the HMO, and then there has to also be an oppor-tunity to go outside the internal re-view process within the HMO to an out-side board that can make a decision tooverturn the HMO's decision inde-pendent of the HMO, an external ap-peal. Beyond that, though, there is also the opportunity to sue. One of the com-plaints that we hear from some of theopponents of the Patients' Bill ofRights is that it allows people to suebecause right now if you fall under theFederal preemption under ERISA be-cause your health plan is provided byan employer who is self-insured, whichthere are a lot in this country, youcannot sue the HMO. The Federal lawprohibits you from suing the HMO. Weeliminate that provision and say thatif the reviews that I mentioned, inter-nal and external, fail, that you havethe option to go to court and sue tooverturn the HMO's decision, which Ithink is a very valuable reform andprotection, patient protection, underthe Patients' Bill of Rights. I do not want to continue to go on about the Patients' Bill of Rights andprovide more details because I knowthat we have done that many times. Ihave talked about it many times. Ithink the time now is for action. TheRepublicans are in the majority. Theycontrol the agenda. They need to havea conference on the Patients' Bill ofRights. They need to have the con-ference include both Democrats andRepublicans, and mostly including thepeople that supported the Houseversion that actually passed here inthe House of Representatives, and theyneed to act expeditiously so that wecan get a bill out of conference and tothe President that is actually a strongbill that protects patients' rights. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 January 31, 2000 We will continue as Democrats to say over and over again that this must bedone over the next few weeks, as webegin this new session of the Congress. Now, let me, Mr. Speaker, if I can, move on to the second health careissue that I said earlier this evening isso important and again that the Presi-dent addressed in his State of theUnion address, and that is the issue ofprescription drug benefits under Medi-care. When Medicare was started in the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnsonproposed it, prescription drugs werenot that important. Medicare wasstarted in the sixties primarily becauseof the huge costs of hospital care, andpeople did not rely on medication orprescription drugs so much as a preven-tive measure the way they do today,but yet now 30 years later we all under-stand why prescription drugs are need-ed and they are such a big part of ourhealth care, not only in terms of ourcondition and whether we are going tobe well and be active and not get sick,but even more so they take a big biteout of your budget if you have to payfor them privately. We know that some people do get prescription drugs as part of Medicare.If they are in an HMO, the HMO mightprovide some coverage, but what wefind is that increasingly more andmore of the HMOs that were providingcoverage for prescription drugs are cut-ting back, charging more in terms ofcopayments or even a premium, to theseniors that are enrolled in the HMO. We still have a lot of seniors who are in the fee-for-service program, not partof an HMO. Some of them may havewhat we call Medigap, supplementalcoverage that they pay for privately,that would include prescription drugsbut again that is becoming increas-ingly prohibitive. 2015 The costs keep rising, the coverage keeps diminishing. So even if you havea prescription drug benefit as part ofMedicare or because you have aMedigap policy, you find yourself in-creasingly paying more and moremoney out of pocket. Some people, if they have no bene- fits, are paying $1,500, $2,000, $2,500 ayear for prescription drugs, and theysimply cannot afford it. The easiest way to deal with this problem is to include it under Medicareas part of the basic benefit package andpass legislation that would accomplishthat. I also think that it is important,though, that when we pass that legisla-tion and that when we consider thatlegislation, that we put in some provi-sion that allows for a better price nego-tiation, because right now what we findis that seniors that are not part of anHMO and who have to go buy a pre-scription at the drugstore themselves,even if they have some coverage underMediGap or whatever, they are payingexorbitant prices for the prescriptiondrugs, way out of proportion to whatthey would pay if they were in an HMO or had some other way to negotiate aprice on a large volume basis. So thebill, when passed, needs to address thatprice discrimination issue as well. I just wanted to mention the Presi- dent's proposal. The President has avery good Medicare prescription drugproposal. It is not the only one outthere. I have one myself. There areother Members of the House on theDemocratic side that have differentproposals out there. But Democrats areunited in saying that we want to havethis benefit, that we support the Presi-dent, that we need a prescription drugbenefit under Medicare, and we need itnow because of the crisis that we seeout there. Let me just talk a little bit, if I can, about the President's initiative in thisregard. What he does, what he pro-poses, is establishing a new voluntaryMedicare part D prescription drug ben-efit that is affordable and available toall beneficiaries. This is voluntary.This is like Part B. Part A is your hos-pitalization, Part B takes care of yourdoctor bills. This would be a new partD, again voluntary, where you pay somuch of a premium per month and youget a certain prescription drug benefit.You do not have to do it if you thinkyou have other options that are betterfor you. What the President's drug benefit would provide is that there would be nodeductible, but you would pay for halfof the drug costs from the first pre-scription. So basically what the gov-ernment would do is they would pay forhalf of the prescription drug, and thatwould begin with the first prescriptionthat is filled. This would be up to $5,000a year in spending when it is fully inplace. In other words, if you incur drug bills up to $5,000, half of it would be paid byMedicare, and it could be as little as$10 or $20, if that is all it costs over thecourse of the year, and half of thatwould be paid by Medicare. The President's proposal would also ensure beneficiaries a price discountsimilar to that offered by many em-ployer-sponsored plans for each pre-scription purchased, even after the$5,000 limit is reached. Again, there isgoing to be a price discount becauseyou are going to be part of this Medi-care program where the government orthe intermediary can actually nego-tiate a better price for you. The cost is about $24 per month be- ginning in 2002 when the coverage iscapped at $2,000, and would rise toabout $44 per month when fully phasedin in about 6 to 7 years when the totalbenefit can go up to $5,000 in prescrip-tion drugs, which is about comparableto what we pay now for Part B for thedoctor bills in terms of the premium. Just like now in Part B for doctor bills, people who are at lower incomesat a certain level pay no premium. Peo-ple who are a little above that lowestlevel pay part of that $44 a month pre-mium. So we would ensure that bene-ficiaries with incomes below 135 per- cent of poverty, $11,000 for a single in-dividual, $15,000 for a couple, would notpay anything for cost-sharing. Peoplewho are a little above that incomewould phase in and pay some of thepremium but not all of it. I do not want to go into more detail about this, Mr. Speaker. I just think itis a very good proposal. As I said, it isnot the only proposal out there. But asDemocrats, we are united in the ideathat we need to have a Medicare pre-scription drug plan, because the crisisin terms of constituents and Americansbeing able to pay the bill and foot thebill is way out of line. I just do notwant to want to see more people nottake prescription drugs when they needthem because they cannot afford to payfor them. Let me go to the third issue I want to mention this evening with regard tohealth care, and again, part of theDemocrats' agenda with regard tohealth care, and also something thatthe President talked about in his Stateof the Union again last Thursdaynight. This is the problem with accessfor the uninsured. The number of uninsured continues to rise. I think I gave the figure ofabout 45 million Americans now thathave no health insurance; workingfamilies, people that go out every dayand work one, two, or sometimes morejobs, but do not have any coveragethrough their employer and cannot af-ford to pay for it privately. Mr. Speaker, we know that when President Clinton was first elected tooffice going back I guess 7 years now hehad put forward a comprehensive uni-versal health care plan. That was shotdown. I do not want to go into tonightwhether it was a good or a bad plan orhow people felt about it. Frankly, Ithought it was a very good plan. Iwould have supported it. I think if ithad been put into place, we would nothave this 45 million uninsured and thenumber of uninsured continuing to riseevery day if this had been put in place6 or 7 years ago the way the Presidentwanted it. But politically it was notpossible to do so. The insurance compa-nies attacked the President's proposal.The Harry and Louise ads were on TV.Basically, the proposal died. It nevereven came up on the House floor, onthe Senate floor. Ever since then, those of us who have been concerned about the problems ofthe uninsured on the Democratic sidehave been trying to sort of look at thetarget groups, the key groups withinthat 45 million uninsured people thatperhaps we can help without movinginto a universal coverage system whichpolitically is simply not saleable atthis point. We started out targeting a number of different groups, most notably a coupleof years ago children, because a bigpercentage of that uninsured groupwere children. We put in place the KidsCare initiative. We came out of theHealth Care Task Force, which I co- VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 2000 chair. We convinced enough Repub- licans to go along with it, and almostall, I think every Democrat voted forit, and enough Republicans to get themajority, so we passed the Kids Careinitiative. What we find is that, although we have addressed the problems of some ofthe children, we still have a lot of chil-dren that remain uninsured. Then wehave a lot of parents of those childrenwho are uninsured, because usually if aperson is working and they get healthcare on the job, they can get their chil-dren covered as part of that policy. Butthe bottom line is that those parentsthat have uninsured children who havesigned up for the Kid Care program, itis called CHIP, are usually uninsuredthemselves. What the President has said is that initially what he wants to do, and thisis part of the Democratic agenda, is tryto expand the coverage for as manychildren as possible by expanding theeligibility for the Kids Care initiative,and also going out and trying to reachkids that may be even eligible forMedicare, which is at a lower-incomebracket than Kids Care, and make surethat they get signed up, because weknow that so many of them have notsigned up for Medicaid or for the KidsCare initiative, even though they areeligible for it. So there is an outreach component here among the Democrats' agenda,and there is also the component toraise the income level so that morechildren who are uninsured would beeligible for the Kids Care initiative. Then the President and the Demo- cratic agenda goes one step further. Itsays that a big part of this 45 millionpeople who are uninsured is not onlythe children but their parents, as Imentioned before. Let us allow parentsalso to opt into the CHIP program. Ifthey have children who are uninsuredand are now signed up for it, let themsign up for it as well. The Presidentprovides in his State of the Union mes-sage and will provide in his budget forexactly that. Just to give an idea, some statistics, over 80 percent of parents of uninsuredchildren with incomes below 200 per-cent of poverty, which is about $33,000for a family of four, and I want tostress that, we are not talking hereabout people that are on Medicaid, weare talking about a family of four mak-ing $33,000 a year. Some people wouldnot consider that poor, but the bottomline is that a great percentage of thosefamilies do not have access to healthinsurance, even though they are work-ing, because they cannot get it on thejob and they cannot afford to buy itprivately. There are about they estimate 6.5 million uninsured parents with in-comes in the Medicaid and the CHIP,which is the Kids Care, eligibilityrange for children, and what the ad-ministration does, what the Presidentdoes in his budget is he creates a newfamily care program. It basically pro-vides higher Federal matching pay- ments for State coverage of parents ofchildren eligible for Medicaid or theCHIP program. Under family care, parents would be covered in the same plan as their chil-dren. States would use the same sys-tems and follow most of the rules asthey do in Medicaid and CHIP today,and the program would be overseen bythe same State agency. There would bea match that is provided here. Stateswould have to cover a certain percentand the Federal government would pro-vide a certain percent. I just think this is so important, be- cause again, I was listening to my col-league earlier on the Republican sidewho was talking about the marriagetax penalty. I agree that the marriagetax penalty should be eliminated, andhopefully we will do that over the nextcouple of months here. The bottom line, however, is that more important, really, to a familywhich has parents who are working, aworking family, is the fact that theyneed health insurance, because if theydo not have health insurance and theyget sick, then they are basically de-pendent upon going to the emergencyroom, incurring huge bills that theyprobably can never pay, and this is notthe way we should operate in thiscountry today with the economy beingthe way it is and with the people thatare working and trying to make a liv-ing. I think that the President's initia- tive not only for expanding it for chil-dren but also for parents is really soimportant. The other thing that I have not men- tioned but I want to with regard to ac-cess to health care for the uninsured isthat if we look at this 45 million peoplewho are uninsured, I mentioned thekids initially, then I mentioned theparents of those children who are unin-sured, another huge block of people arewhat we call the near elderly. Theseare people probably between the ages of55 and 65 who are not eligible yet forMedicare but who basically are unin-sured, either because maybe they weremarried to a spouse who had health in-surance on the job but then that spousedied, so they do not have any health in-surance themselves, or they were laidoff, or they took an early retirementthat did not provide health benefits. What we find is that there are just a huge number of people between that 55and 65 age range for whatever reasonthat are still not eligible for Medicarebecause they are not old enough, butfind themselves without health insur-ance, either because they are not work-ing or because their spouse died andthey do not have it, and they have noway of buying health insurance pri-vately because it is too expensive andthey do not make enough money. A couple of years ago, I think it was not this year but in the previous Stateof the Union Address, or maybe evenprior to that, President Clinton pro-posed a Medicare buy-in for those indi-viduals. In other words, we would fig- ure out what the cost per month forthe Medicare program is to the Federalgovernment, and they would be able tosimply purchase Medicare at that cost,which I think the President has esti-mated is somewhere between $300 and$400 a month. I always thought that was a great idea, but the problem is for a lot ofthese people $300 to $400 is prohibitive.They cannot afford it. There are different ways of trying to deal with that. I had advocated somekind of sliding scale subsidy for thoseindividuals. The President in his Stateof the Union Address last week talkedabout using a tax credit as a way ofhelping these people so they could ad-dress and buy into Medicare. What he basically says is that in order to make this buy-in more afford-able, the President proposes a tax cred-it equal to 25 percent of the premiumfor participants in the Medicare buy-in. 2030 I think that is good. Let me say this, the Congress has not addressed this atall. The House of Representatives hasnot considered this in committee, ithas not come to the floor of the House. So once again I call on my Repub- lican colleagues who are in the major-ity to bring up the Medicare buy-in forthe near-elderly and allow it to cometo the floor, because I think it will passif it comes to the floor. Number one,we have to allow the buy-in, which isnot the law; and number two, we haveto find a way through either a tax cred-it, as the President has proposed, orsome subsidy to make it possible formore people to afford that buy-in. Butright now, we do not have it at all. So, again, access to health insurance coverage. What do we do? Address theproblem with kids more extensively,address the problems of the parents ofthe kids, and the problem of the near-elderly. But the President and theDemocrats have gone even further. Wehave 45 million Americans uninsured.If we are not able to cover all of themthrough some universal system, thenwe have to address it piecemeal. Again, how have most Americans been covered traditionally? Throughtheir employer. Unfortunately, thenumber of employers percentage wisethat offer health insurance has de-creased. But if we can create some sortof incentive so that those employersonce again will offer health insurance,particularly the small businesspeoplethat have the most difficult time buy-ing the policy and making it availableto their employees, then we can alsomake, I think, a significant dent inthis group of 45 million Americans whoare uninsured. Mr. Speaker, what the President has proposed, again, is to give small firms,those with fewer than 25 employeesthat have not previously offered healthinsurance, a tax credit equal to 20 per-cent of their contributions. And thereare a number of other here: VerDate 31, 2000 Making COBRA continuation coverage more affordable; expanding State op-tions to provide health insurance.There are a number of initiatives herethat the President has put forward andthat are part of the Democratic agen-da. I am not going to go into all ofthem because I did promise that Iwould not take up all the time thatwas allotted. But, Mr. Speaker, I want to stress again the importance of these threeissues: HMO reform, pass the Patients'Bill of Rights; two, Medicare prescrip-tion drug coverage; and, lastly, tryingto address the problem of access for theuninsured, those 45 million Americanswho do not have health insurance. I cannot think of anything that is more important for this House of Rep-resentatives to take up over the next 10months or so between now and the No-vember election, and I call upon mycolleagues on the Republican side whoare in the majority, the Speaker, theMajority Leader, to take up theseissues and to pass legislation that ad-dresses these concerns in a strong andeffective manner. We will be here as Democrats. I promise that I will be here. My col-leagues will be here every night if wehave to demanding action on thesethree health care issues because this iswhat our constituents talk to us about,this is what needs to be done. And it isnot that difficult to do if only the Re-publicans would join with the Demo-crats in addressing these concerns. A REPUBLIC, IF YOU CAN KEEP IT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. G REEN of Wisconsin). Under the Speak- er's announced policy of January 6,1999, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.P AUL) is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I have taken this special order this evening to dis-cuss the importance of the AmericanRepublic and why it should be pre-served. Mr. Speaker, the dawn of a new cen- tury and millennium is upon us andprompts many of us to reflect on ourpast and prepare for the future. OurNation, divinely blessed, has much tobe thankful for. The blessings of lib-erty resulting from the Republic ourforefathers designed have far surpassedthe wildest dreams of all previous gen-erations. The form of government secured by the Declaration of Independence, theAmerican Revolution and the Constitu- tion is unique in history and reflectsthe strongly held beliefs of the Amer-ican revolutionaries. At the close ofthe Constitutional Convention inPhiladelphia on September 18, 1787, aMrs. Powel anxiously awaited the re-sults and as Benjamin Franklinemerged from the long task now fin-ished asked him directly, ``Well, Doc-tor, what have we got? A republic or amonarchy?'' ``A republic, if you cankeep it,'' responded Franklin. The term ``republic'' had a signifi- cant meaning for both of them and allearly Americans. It meant a lot more than just representative governmentand was a form of government in starkcontrast to pure democracy where themajority dictated laws and rights. Andgetting rid of the English monarchywas what the revolution was all about,so a monarchy was out of the question. The American Republic required strict limitation of government power.Those powers permitted would be pre-cisely defined and delegated by thepeople with all public officials beingbound by their oath of office to upholdthe Constitution. The democratic proc-ess would be limited to the election ofour leaders and not used for grantingspecial privileges to any group or indi-vidual nor for defining rights. Federalism, the binding together loosely of the several States, wouldserve to prevent the concentration ofpower in a central government and wasa crucial element in the new republic.The authors of the Constitution wrotestrict limits on the national govern-ment and strove to protect the rightsand powers of the State and the people. Dividing and keeping separate the legislative, executive, and the judici-ary branches provided the checks andbalances thought needed to preservethe Republic the Constitution createdand the best way to preserve individualliberty. The American Revolutionaries clear- ly chose liberty over security for theireconomic security and their very liveswere threatened by undertaking thejob of forming a new and limited gov-ernment. Most would have been a lotricher and safer by sticking with theKing. Economic needs or desires werenot the driving force behind the earlyAmerican patriotic effort. The Revolution and subsequent Con- stitution settled the question as towhich authority should rule man's ac-tion, the individual or the state. Theauthors of the Constitution clearly un-derstood that man has free will tomake personal choices and be respon-sible for the consequences of his ownactions. Man, they knew, was not sim-ply to be a cog in a wheel or a singlecell of an organism or a branch of atree but an individual with free willand responsibility for his eternal soulas well as his life on earth. If God couldpermit spiritual freedom, governmentcertainly ought to permit the politicalfreedom that allows one to pursue life'sdreams and assume one's responsibil-ities. If man can achieve spiritual redemp- tion through grace which allows him touse the released spiritual energy topursue man's highest and noblestgoals, so should man's mind, body, andproperty be freed from the burdens ofunchecked government authority. Thefounders were confident that thiswould release the creative human en-ergy required to produce the goods andservices that would improve the livingstandards of all mankind. Minimizing government authority over the people was critical to this en-deavor. Just as the individual was key to salvation, individual effort was thekey to worldly endeavors. Little doubtexisted that material abundance and sustenance came from work and effort,family, friends, church, and voluntarycommunity action, as long as govern-ment did not obstruct. No doubts were cast as to where rights came from. They came from theCreator. And if government could notgrant rights to individuals, it certainlyshould not be able to take them away.If government could provide rights orprivileges, it was reasoned, it couldonly occur at the expense of someoneelse or with the loss of personal libertyin general. Our constitutional Republic, accord- ing to our founders, should above allelse protect the rights of the minorityagainst the abuses of an authoritarianmajority. They feared democracy asmuch as monarchy and demanded aweak executive, a restrained court, anda handicapped legislature. It was clearly recognized that equal justice and protection of the minoritywas not egalitarianism. Socialism andwelfarism were never considered. Thecolonists wanted to be free of theKing's oppressive high taxes and bur-densome regulations. It annoyed themthat even their trees on their ownproperty could not be cut without theKing's permission. The King kept thebest trees for himself and his ship-building industry. This violation ofproperty ownership prompted the colo-nists to use the pine tree on an earlyrevolutionary flag to symbolize thefreedom they sought. The Constitution made it clear that the government was not to interferewith productive, nonviolent human en-ergy. This is the key element that haspermitted America's great achieve-ments. It was a great plan. We shouldall be thankful for the bravery and wis-dom of those who established this Na-tion and secured the Constitution forus. We have been the political and eco-nomic envy of the world. We have trulybeen blessed. The founders often spoke of divine providence and that God willed us thisgreat Nation. It has been a grand ex-periment, but it is important that thefundamental moral premises that un-derpin this Nation are understood andmaintained. We, as Members of Con-gress, have that responsibility. This is a good year to address this subject, the beginning of a new centuryand millennium provides a wonderfulopportunity for all of us to dedicateourselves to studying and preservingthese important principles of liberty. One would have to conclude from his- tory as well as current conditions thatthe American Republic has been ex-tremely successful. It certainly has al-lowed the creation of great wealth witha large middle-class and many verywealthy corporations and individuals.Although the poor are still among us,compared to other parts of the world,even the poor in this country havedone quite well. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 January 31, 2000 We still can freely move about from town to town, State to State, and jobto job. Free education is available toeveryone, even for those who do notwant it or care about it. But the capa-ble and the incapable are offered a gov-ernment education. We can attend thechurch of our choice, start a news-paper, use the Internet and meet in pri-vate when we choose. Food is plentifulthroughout the country and oftentimeseven wasted. Medical technology hasdramatically advanced and increasedlife expectancy for both men andwomen. Government statistics are continu- ously reaffirming our great prosperitywith evidence of high and rising wages,no inflation, and high consumer con-fidence and spending. The U.S. Govern-ment still enjoys good credit and astrong currency in relationship to mostother currencies of the world. We haveno trouble financing our public nor pri-vate debt. Housing markets are boom-ing and interest rates remain reason-able by modern day standards. Unem-ployment is low. Recreational spending and time spent at leisure are at historic highs. Stockmarket profits are benefiting morefamilies than ever in our history. In-come, payroll, and capital gains taxeshave been a windfall for politicianswho lack no creative skills in figuringout how to keep the tax-and-spend poli-cies in full gear. The American peopleaccept the status quo and hold nogrudges against our President. The nature of a republic and the cur- rent status of our own are of little con-cern to the American people in general.Yet there is a small minority ignoredby political, academic, and media per-sonnel who do spend time thinkingabout the importance of what the prop-er role for government should be. Thecomparison of today's government tothe one established by our Constitutionis the subject of deep discussion forthose who concern themselves with thefuture and look beyond the fall elec-tion. The benefits we enjoy are a result of the Constitution our founding fathershad the wisdom to write. However, un-derstanding the principles that wereused to establish our Nation is crucialto its preservation and something wecannot neglect. Unbelievable changes have occurred in the 20th century. We went from thehorse and buggy age to the space age.Computer technology and the Internethave dramatically changed the way welive. All kinds of information and opin-ions on any subject are now availableby clicking a few buttons. Technologyoffers an opportunity for everyone whoseeks to the truth to find it, yet at thesame time it enhances the ability ofgovernment to monitor our every phys-ical, communicative, and financialmove. Mr. Speaker, let there be no doubt. For the true believers in big govern-ment, they see this technology as agreat advantage for their cause. We arecurrently witnessing an ongoing effort by our government to develop a na-tional ID card, a medical data bank, awork data bank, ``Know Your Cus-tomer'' regulations on banking activ-ity, a national security agent all-per-vasive telephone snooping systemcalled Echelon, and many other pro-grams. There are good reasons to un-derstand the many ramifications of themany technological advancements wehave seen over the century to makesure that the good technology is notused by the government to do badthings. 2045 The 20th century has truly been a century of unbelievable technologicaladvancement. We should be cognizantof what this technology has done to thesize and nature of our own Govern-ment. It could easily be argued that,with greater technological advances,the need for government ought to de-cline and private alternatives be en-hanced. But there is not much evidencefor that argument. In 1902, the cost of Government ac- tivities at all levels came to 7.7 percentof GDP. Today it is more than 50 per-cent. Government officials oversee every- thing we do, from regulating theamount of water in our commodes toplacing airbags in our cars, safetylocks on our guns, and using our ownland. Almost every daily activity weengage in is monitored or regulated bysome Government agency. If one at-tempts to just avoid Government har-assment, one finds himself in deeptrouble with the law. Yes, we can be grateful that the tech- nological developments in the market-place over the last 100 years have madeour lives more prosperous and enjoy-able. But any observant person must beannoyed by the ever-present Big Broth-er that watches and records our everymove. The idea that we are responsible for our own actions has been seriously un-dermined. And it would be grossly mis-leading to argue that the huge growthin the size of government has beenhelpful and necessary in raising thestandard of living of so many Ameri-cans. Since government cannot create any- thing, it can only resort to using forceto redistribute the goods that energeticcitizens produce. The old-fashionedterm for this is ``theft.'' It is clear that our great prosperity has come in spite of the obstacles thatbig government places in our way andnot because of it. And besides, our cur-rent prosperity may well not be as per-manent as many believe. Quite a few major changes in public policy have occurred in this century.These changes in policy reflect our cur-rent attitude toward the American Re-public and the Constitution and help usto understand what to expect in the fu-ture. Economic prosperity seems tohave prevailed. But the appropriatequestion asked by too few Americans is, have our personal liberties be under-mined? Taxes: Taxes are certainly higher. A federal income tax of 35 to 40 percent issomething many middle-class Ameri-cans must pay, while, on average, theywork for the Government more thanhalf the year. In passing on our estatesfrom one generation to the next, ourpartner, the U.S. Government, decideson its share before the next generationcan take over. The estate tax certainly verifies the saying about the inevitability of deathand taxes. At the turn of the century,we had neither. And in spite of a con-tinuous outcry against both, there isno sign that either will soon be elimi-nated. Accepting the principle behind both the income and the estate tax concedesthe statist notion that the Governmentowns the fruits of our labor as well asour savings and we are permitted bythe politicians' generosity to keep acertain percentage. Every tax cut proposal in Wash- ington now is considered a cost to Gov-ernment, not the return of somethingrightfully belonging to a productivecitizen. This principle is true whetherit is a 1 percent or 70 percent incometax. Concern for this principle has beenrarely expressed in a serious mannerover the past 50 years. The withholdingprocess has permitted many to believethat a tax rebate at the end of the yearcomes as a gift from Government. Because of this, the real cost of Gov- ernment to the taxpayer is obscured.The income tax has grown to such anextent and the Government is so de-pendent on it that any talk of elimi-nating the income tax is just that,talk. A casual acceptance of the prin-ciple behind high taxation with an in-come tax and an inheritance tax is in-compatible with the principle belief ina true republic. It is impossible tomaintain a high tax system withoutthe sacrifice of liberty and an under-mining of property ownership. If keptin place, such a system will undermineprosperity regardless of how well off wemay presently be. In truth, the amount of taxes we now pay compared to 100 years ago is shock-ing. There is little philosophic con-demnation by the intellectual commu-nity, the political leaders, or the mediaof this immoral system. This should bea warning sign to all of us that even inless prosperous times we can expecthigh taxes and that our productive eco-nomic system will come under attack. Not only have we seen little resist- ance to the current high tax system, ithas become an acceptable notion thatthis system is moral and is a justifiedrequirement to finance the welfare/warfare state. Propaganda polls are continuously cited claiming that the American peo-ple do not want tax reductions. Hightaxes, except for only short periods oftime, are incompatible with libertyand prosperity. We will, I am sure, be VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 Feb January 31, 2000 given the opportunity in the early part of the next century to make a choicebetween the two. I am certain of mypreference. Welfare: There was no welfare state in 1900. In the year 2000, we have a hugewelfare state which continues to groweach year. Not that special interestlegislation did not exist in the 19thcentury. But for the most part, it waslimited and directed toward themonied interest, the most egregious ex-ample being the railroads. The modern-day welfare state has steadily grown since the Great Depres-sion of the 1930s. The Federal Govern-ment is now involved in providinghealthcare, houses, unemployment ben-efits, education, food stamps to mil-lions, plus all kinds of subsidies toevery conceivable special interestgroup. Welfare is now a part of our cul-ture, costing hundreds of billions ofdollars every year. It is now thought tobe a right, something one is entitledto. Calling it an entitlement makes itsound proper and respectable and notbased on theft. Anyone who has a need, desire, or de- mand and can get the politicians' at-tention will get what he wants eventhough it may be at the expense ofsomeone else. Today, it is considered morally right and politically correct to promote thewelfare state. Any suggestion other-wise is considered political suicide. The acceptance of the welfare ethic and rejection of the work ethic as theprocess for improving one's economiccondition are now ingrained in our po-litical institutions. This process wasstarted in earnest in the 1930s, receiveda big boost in the 1960s, and has contin-ued a steady growth even through the1990s despite some rhetoric in opposi-tion. This public acceptance has occurred in spite of the fact that there is no evi-dence that welfare is a true help in as-sisting the needy. Its abject failurearound the world where welfarism tookthe next step into socialism has even aworse record. The transition in the past hundred years from essentially no welfare to anall encompassing welfare state rep-resents a major change in attitude inthe United States. Along with the ac-ceptance, the promoters have dramati-cally reinterpreted the Constitution in the way it had been for our first 150years. Where the General Welfare clause once had a clear general meaning,which was intended to prohibit specialinterest welfare and was somethingthey detested and revolted againstunder King George, it is now used tojustify any demand of any group aslong as a majority in the Congressvotes for it. But the history is clear and the words in the Constitution are precise.Madison and Jefferson, in explainingthe General Welfare clause, left nodoubt as to its meaning. Madison said, ``With respect to the words `general welfare,' I have alwaysregarded them as qualified by the de- tail of power connected with them. Totake them in a literal and unlimitedsense would be a metamorphosis of theConstitution and to a character whichthere is a host of proof not con-templated by its creators.'' Madison argued that there would be no purpose whatsoever for the enu-meration of the particular powers ifthe General Welfare clause was to bebroadly interpreted. The Constitution granted authority to the Federal Government to do only20 things, each to be carried out for thebenefits of the general welfare of allthe people. This understanding of the Constitu- tion, as described by the Father of theConstitution, has been lost in this cen-tury. Jefferson was just as clear, writ-ing in 1798 when he said, ``Congress hasnot unlimited powers to provide for thegeneral welfare but only those specifi-cally enumerated.'' With the modern-day interpretation of the General Welfare clause, the prin-ciple of individual liberty in the Doc-trine of Enumerated Powers have beenmade meaningless. The goal of strictly limiting the power of our national Government aswas intended by the Constitution is im-possible to achieve as long as it is ac-ceptable for Congress to redistributewealth in an egalitarian welfare state. There is no way that personal liberty will not suffer with every effort to ex-pand or make the welfare state effi-cient. And the sad part is that the sin-cere effort to help people do better eco-nomically through welfare programsalways fails. Dependency replaces self-reliance, while the sense of self-worthof the recipient suffers, making for anangry, unhappy and dissatisfied soci-ety. The cost in dollar terms is high,but the cost in terms of liberty is evengreater but generally ignored; and, inthe long run, there is nothing to showfor this sacrifice. Today there is no serious effort to challenge welfare as a way of life, andits uncontrolled growth in the nexteconomic downturn is to be expected.Too many citizens now believe they areentitled to the monetary assistancefrom the Government anytime theyneed it and they expect it. Even intimes of plenty, the direction has beento continue expanding education, wel-fare, and retirement benefits. No one asked where the Government gets the money to finance the welfarestate. Is it morally right to do so? Is itauthorized in the Constitution? Does ithelp anyone in the long run? Who suf-fers from the policy? Until these ques-tions are seriously asked and correctlyanswered, we cannot expect the marchtoward a pervasive welfare state tostop and we can expect our liberties tobe continuously compromised. The concept of the Doctrine of Enu- merated Powers was picked away at inthe latter part of the 19th century overstrong objection by many constitu-tionalists. But it was not until thedrumbeat of fear coming from the Roo- sevelt administration during the GreatDepression that the courts virtually re-wrote the Constitution by reinterpreta-tion of the General Welfare clause. In 1936, the New Deal Supreme Court told Congress and the American peoplethat the Constitution is irrelevantwhen it comes to limits being placed oncongressional spending. In a ruling jus-tifying the Agricultural AdjustmentAct, the Court pronounced, ``The powerof Congress to authorize appropriationsof public money for public purposes isnot limited by the grants of legislativepower found in the Constitution.'' With the stroke of a pen, the courts amended the Constitution in such asweeping manner that it literally le-galized the entire welfare state, which,not surprisingly, has grown by leapsand bounds ever since. Since this ruling, we have rarely heard the true explanation of the Gen-eral Welfare clause as being a restric-tion of government power, not a grantof unlimited power. We cannot ignore corporate welfare, which is part of the problem. Most peo-ple think the welfare state involvesonly giving something to the unfortu-nate poor. This is generally true. Butonce the principle established that spe-cial benefits are legitimate, the moniedinterests see the advantages and influ-ences the legislative process. Our system, which pays lip service to free enterprise and private propertyownership, is drifting towards a form offascism or corporatism rather thanconventional socialism. And where thepoor never seem to benefit under wel-fare, corporations become richer. Butit should have been expected that oncethe principle of favoritism was estab-lished, the contest would be over whohas the greatest clout in Washington. No wonder lobbyists are willing to spend $125 million per month influ-encing Congress; it is a good invest-ment. No amount of campaign financereform or regulation of lobbyists candeal with this problem. The problemlies in the now accepted role for ourGovernment. Government has toomuch control over people and the mar-ket, making the temptation and incen-tive to influence government irresist-ible and, to a degree, necessary. Curtailing how people spend their own money or their right to petitiontheir government will do nothing tothis influence peddling. Treating thesymptoms and not the disease only fur-ther undermines the principles of free-dom and property ownership. Any serious reforms or effort to break away from the welfare statemust be directed as much at corporatewelfare as routine welfare. Since thereis no serious effort to reject welfare onprinciple, the real conflict over how todivide what Government plunders willcontinue. Once it is clear that it is not nearly as wealthy as it appears, this will be-come a serious problem and it will getthe attention it deserves, even here inthe Congress. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 31, 2000 Preserving liberty and restoring con- stitutional precepts are impossible aslong as the welfare mentality prevails,and that will not likely change untilwe have run out of money. But it willbecome clear as we move into the nextcentury that perpetual wealth and theso-called balanced budget, along withan expanding welfare state, cannotcontinue indefinitely. Any effort toperpetuate it will only occur with thefurther erosion of liberty. 2100 The role of the U.S. Government in public education has changed dramati-cally over the past 100 years. Most ofthe major changes have occurred in thesecond half of this century. In the 19thcentury, the closest the Federal Gov-ernment got to public education wasthe land grant college program. In thelast 40 years, the Federal Governmenthas essentially taken charge of the en-tire system. It is involved in educationat every level through loans, grants,court directives, regulations and cur-riculum manipulation. In 1900, it was ofno concern to the Federal Governmenthow local schools were run at anylevel. After hundreds of billions of dollars, we have yet to see a shred of evidencethat the drift toward central controlover education has helped. By all meas-urements, the quality of education isdown. There are more drugs and vio-lence in the public schools than everbefore. Discipline is impossible out offear of lawsuits or charges of civilrights violations. Controlled curriculahave downplayed the importance of ourconstitutional heritage while indoctri-nating our children, even in kinder-garten, with environmental mythol-ogy, internationalism and sexual lib-eration. Neighborhood schools in theearly part of the 20th century did notexperience this kind of propaganda. The one good result coming from our failed educational system has been thelimited, but important, revival of thenotion that parents are responsible fortheir children's education, not thestate. We have seen literally millionsof children taken from the publicschool system and taught at home orin private institutions in spite of theadditional expense. This has helpedmany students and has also served topressure the government schools intodoing a better job. And the statisticsshow that middle-income and low-in-come families are the most eager toseek an alternative to the public schoolsystem. There is no doubt that the way schools are run, how the teachers teachand how the bills are paid is dramati-cally different from 100 years ago. Andeven though some that go through pub-lic schools do exceptionally well, thereis clear evidence that the average highschool graduate today is far less edu-cated than his counterpart was in theearly part of this century. Due to the poor preparation of our high school graduates, college expectsvery little from their students since nearly everyone gets to go to collegewho wants to. Public school is compul-sory and college is available to almosteveryone, regardless of qualifications.In 1914, English composition was re-quired in 98 percent of our colleges.Today, it is about one-third. Only 12percent of today's colleges require mathematics be taught where in 1914,82 percent did. No college now requiresliterature courses, but rest assuredplenty of social babble courses are re-quired as we continue to dumb downour Nation. Federal funding for education grows every year, hitting $38 billion thisyear, $1 billion more than requested bythe administration and 7 percent morethan last year. Great congressional de-bates occur over the size of the class-room, student and teacher testing, bi-lingual education, teacher salaries,school violence and drug usage. And itis politically incorrect to point outthat all these problems are not presentin the private schools. Every year,there is less effort at the Federal levelto return education to the people, theparents and the local school officials. For 20 years at least, some of our presidential candidates advocated theabolishing of the Department of Edu-cation and for the Federal Governmentto get completely out of public edu-cation. This year, we will hear no moreof that. The President got more moneyfor education than he asked for and itis considered not only bad manners butalso political suicide to argue the casefor stopping all Federal Governmenteducation programs. Talk of returning some control of Federal programs to the States is notthe same as keeping the Federal Gov-ernment out of education as directedby the Constitution. Of the 20 congres-sionally authorized functions grantedby the Constitution, education is notone of them. That should be enough ofa reason not to be involved. There is noevidence of any benefit and statisticsshow that great harm has resulted. Ithas cost us hundreds of billions of dol-lars, yet we continue the inexorablemarch toward total domination of oureducational system by Washington bu-reaucrats and politicians. It makes nosense. It is argued that if the Federalfunding for education did not continue,education would suffer even more. Yetwe see poor and middle-class familieseducating their children at home or atprivate school at a fraction of the costof a government school education, withresults fantastically better, and alldone in the absence of violence anddrugs. A case can be made that there would be more money available for educationif we just left the money in the Statesto begin with and never brought it toWashington for the bureaucrats andthe politicians to waste. But it lookslike Congress will not soon learn thislesson, so the process will continue andthe results will get worse. The bestthing we could do now is pass a bill togive parents a $3,000 tax credit for each child they educate. This would encour-age competition and allow a lot morechoice for parents struggling to helptheir children get a decent education. The practice of medicine is now a government managed care system andvery few Americans are happy with it.Not only is there little effort to extri-cate the Federal Government from themedical care business but the processof expanding the government's rolecontinues unabated. At the turn of the19th century, it was not even consid-ered a possibility that medical carewas the responsibility of the FederalGovernment. Since Lyndon Johnson'sGreat Society programs of the 1960s, the role of the Federal Government indelivering medical care has grown ex-ponentially. Today the Federal Govern-ment pays more than 60 percent of allthe medical bills and regulates all of it.The demands continue for more freecare at the same time complaintsabout the shortcomings of managedcare multiply. Yet it is natural to as-sume that government planning and fi-nancing will sacrifice quality care. It isnow accepted that people who needcare are entitled to it as a right. Thisis a serious error in judgment. There is no indication that the trend toward government medicine will bereversed. Our problems are related tothe direct takeover of medical care inprograms like Medicare and Medicaid.But it has also been the interference inthe free market through ERISA man-dates related to HMOs and other man-aged care organizations, as well as ourtax code, that have undermined theprivate insurance aspect of paying formedical care. True medical insuranceis not available. The government dic-tates all the terms. In the early stages, patients, doctors and hospitals welcomed these pro-grams. Generous care was availablewith more than adequate reimburse-ment. It led to what one would expect,abuse, overcharges and overuse. Whencosts rose, it was necessary throughgovernment rulemaking and bureau-cratic management to cut reimburse-ment and limit the procedures avail-able and personal choice of physicians.We do not have socialized medicine butwe do have bureaucratic medicine, mis-managed by the government and selectcorporations who usurp the decision-making power from the physician. Theway medical care is delivered today inthe United States is a perfect exampleof the evils of corporatism and an arti-ficial system that only politicians, re-sponding to the special interests, couldcreate. There is no reason to believethe market cannot deliver medical carein an efficient manner as it does com-puters, automobiles and televisions.But the confidence is gone and every-one assumes, just as in education, thatonly a Federal bureaucracy is capableof solving the problems of maximizingthe number of people, including thepoor, who receive the best medical careavailable. In an effort to help the poor, VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 Feb January 31, 2000 the quality of care has gone down for everyone else and the costs have sky-rocketed. Making generous medical savings ac- counts available is about the only pro-gram talked about today that offers analternative to government mismanagedcare. If something of this sort is notsoon implemented, we can expect morepervasive government involvement in the practice of medicine. With a con-tinual deterioration of its quality, theprivate practice of medicine will soonbe gone. Government housing programs are no more successful than the Federal Gov-ernment's medical and education pro-grams. In the early part of this cen-tury, government housing was vir-tually unheard of. Now the HUD budgetcommands over $30 billion each yearand increases every year. Finances ofmortgages through the Federal HomeLoan Bank, the largest Federal Gov-ernment borrower, is the key financialinstitution pumping in hundreds of bil-lions of dollars of credit into the hous-ing market, making things worse. TheFederal Reserve has now started to usehome mortgage securities for mone-tizing debt. Public housing has a rep-utation for being a refuge for drugs,crimes and filth, with the projectsbeing torn down as routinely as theyare built. There is every indicationthat this entitlement will continue toexpand in size regardless of its failures.Token local control over these expendi-tures will do nothing to solve the prob-lem. Recently, the Secretary of HUD, using public funds to sue gun manufac-turers, claimed this is necessary tosolve the problems of crime which gov-ernment housing perpetuates. If a gov-ernment agency, which was nevermeant to exist in the first place underthe Constitution, can expand their roleinto the legislative and legal matterswithout the consent of the Congress,we indeed have a serious problem onour hands. The programs are badenough in themselves but the abuse ofthe rule of law and ignoring the separa-tion of powers makes these expandingprograms that much more dangerous toour entire political system and is a di-rect attack on personal liberty. If onecares about providing the maximumbest housing for the maximum numberof people, one must consider a freemarket approach in association with asound, nondepreciating currency. Wehave been operating a public housingprogram directly opposite to this andalong with steady inflation and govern-ment promotion of housing since the1960s, the housing market has beengrossly distorted. We can soon expect amajor downward correction in thehousing industry prompted by risinginterest rates. Our attitude toward foreign policy has dramatically changed since the be-ginning of the century. From GeorgeWashington through Grover Cleveland,the accepted policy was to avoid entan-gling alliances. Although we spread ourwings westward and southward as part of our manifest destiny in the 19th cen-tury, we accepted the Monroe Doctrinenotion that European and Asiansshould stay out of our affairs in thishemisphere and we theirs. McKinley,Teddy Roosevelt, and the SpanishAmerican war changed all that. Our in-tellectual and political leaders at theturn of the last century brought intovogue the interventionist doctrine set-ting the stage for the past 100 years ofglobal military activism. From a coun-try that once minded its own business,we now find ourselves with militarypersonnel in more than 130 differentcountries protecting our modern dayAmerican empire. Not only do we havetroops spread to the four corners of theEarth, we find Coast Guard cutters inthe Mediterranean and around theworld, our FBI in any country wechoose, and the CIA in places Congressdoes not even know about. It is a tru-ism that the state grows and freedom is diminished in times of war. Almostperpetual war in the 20th century hassignificantly contributed to steadilyundermining our liberties while glori-fying the state. In addition to the military wars, lib- erty has also suffered from the domes-tic wars on poverty, literacy, drugs,homelessness privacy and many others.We have in the last 100 years gone fromthe accepted and cherished notion of asovereign Nation to one of a globalistnew world order. As we once had threeseparate branches of our government,the United Nations proudly uses itsthree branches, the World Bank, theIMF and the World Trade Organizationto work their will in this new era ofglobalism. Because the U.S. is by farthe strongest military industrialpower, it can dictate the terms of theseinternational institutions, protectingwhat we see as our various interestssuch as oil, along with satisfying ourmilitary industrial complex. Our com-mercial interests and foreign policy areno longer separate. This allows for sub-sidized profits while the taxpayers areforced to protect huge corporationsagainst any losses from overseas in-vestments. The argument that we goabout the world out of humanitarianconcerns for those suffering, which wasthe excuse for bombing Serbia, is afarce. As bad as it is that averageAmericans are forced to subsidize sucha system, we additionally are placed ingreater danger because of our arrogantpolicy of bombing nations that do notsubmit to our wishes. This generatesthe hatred directed toward America,even if at times it seems suppressed,and exposes us to a greater threat ofterrorism since this is the only vehicleour victims can use to retaliate againsta powerful military state. But even with the apparent success of our foreign policy and the militarymight we still have, the actual truth isthat we have spread ourselves too thin-ly and may well have difficulty defend-ing ourselves if we are ever threatenedby any significant force around theworld. At the close of this century, we find our military preparedness and mo-rale at an all-time low. It will becomemore obvious as we move into the 21stcentury that the cost of maintainingthis worldwide presence is too high andcutbacks will be necessary. The costsin terms of liberty lost and the unnec-essary exposure to terrorism are dif-ficult to determine but in time it willbecome apparent to all of us that for-eign interventionism is of no benefit toAmerican citizens but instead is athreat to our liberties. Throughout our early history and up to World War I, our wars were foughtwith volunteers. There was no militarydraft except for a failed attempt byLincoln in the Civil War which endedwith justified riots and rebellionagainst it. The attitudes toward thedraft definitely changed over the pastcentury. Draftees were said to be nec-essary to fight in World War I andWorld War II, Korea and Vietnam. Thischange in attitude has definitely satis-fied those who believe that we have anobligation to police the world. The idi-ocy of Vietnam served as a catalyst foran antidraft attitude which is stillalive today. Fortunately we have nothad a draft for over 25 years, but Con-gress refuses to address this matter ina principled fashion by abolishing onceand for all the useless selective servicesystem. Too many authoritarians inCongress still believe that in times ofneed, an army of teenage draftees willbe needed to defend our commercial in-terests throughout the world. A returnto the spirit of the republic wouldmean that a draft would never be usedand all able-bodied persons would bewilling to volunteer in defense of theirliberty. Without the willingness to doso, liberty cannot be saved. A con-scripted army can never substitute forthe willingness of freedom-lovingAmericans to defend their country outof their love for liberty. 2115 The U.S. monetary system. The U.S. monetary system during the 20th Cen-tury has dramatically changed fromthe one authorized by the Constitution.Only silver and gold were to be used inpayment of debt, and no paper moneywas to be issued. In one of the few re-strictions on the states, the Constitu-tion prohibited them from issuing theirown money, and they were to use onlygold and silver in payment of debt. NoCentral Bank was authorized. The authors of the Constitution were well aware of the dangers of inflation,having seen the harm associated withthe destruction of the Continental cur-rency. They never wanted to see an-other system that ended with the slo-gan, ``it's not worth a Continental.''They much preferred sound as a dollar,or as good as gold, as a description ofour currency. Unfortunately, their concerns as they were reflected in the Constitutionhave been ignored and as this centurycloses we do not have a sound dollar as VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 Feb January 31, 2000 good as gold. The changes to our mone- tary system are by far the most signifi-cant economic events of the 20th Cen-tury. The gold dollar of 1900 is nownothing more than a Federal Reservenote with a promise by untrustworthypoliticians and the central bankers topay nothing for it. No longer is there silver or gold available to protect the value of asteadily depreciating currency. This isa fraud of the worst kind and the typeof a crime that would put a private cit-izen behind bars. But there have beentoo many special interests benefittingby our fiat currency, too much igno-rance and too much apathy regardingthe nature of money. We will surely pay the price for this negligence. The relative soundness ofour currency that we enjoy as we moveinto the 21st Century will not persist.The instability in world currency mar-ket because of the dollar's acceptancefor so many years as the world's cur-rency, will cause devastating adjust-ments that Congress will eventually beforced to address. A transition from sound money to paper money did not occur instanta-neously. It occurred over a 58 year pe-riod between 1913 and 1971, and the mis-chief continues today. Our Central Bank, the Federal Re- serve System, established in 1913 aftertwo failed efforts in the 19th Century,has been the driving force behind thedevelopment of our current fiat sys-tem. Since the turn of the century, wehave seen our dollar lose 95 percent ofits purchasing power, and it continuesto depreciate. This is nothing less thantheft, and those responsible should beheld accountable. The record of the Federal Reserve is abysmal, yet at the close of the 20thCentury, its chairman is held in ex-tremely high esteem, with almost zerocalls for study of sound money with theintent to once again have the dollarlinked to gold. Ironically, the government and poli- ticians are held in very low esteem, yetthe significant trust in them to main-tain the value of the currency is notquestioned. But it should be. The reasons for rejecting gold and promoting paper are not mysterious,since quite a few special interests ben-efit. Deficit financing is much moredifficult when there is no Central Bankavailable to monetize governmentdebt. This gives license to politiciansto spend lavishly on the projects thatare most likely to get them reelected.War is more difficult to pursue if gov-ernment has to borrow or tax the peo-ple for its financing. The Federal Re-serve's ability to create credit out ofthin air to pay the bills run up by Con-gress establishes a symbiosis that iseasy for the politician to love. It is also advantageous for the politi- cians to ignore the negative effectsfrom such a monetary arrangement,since they tend to be hidden and dis-seminated. A paper money system at-tracts support from various economicgroups. Bankers benefit from the float that they get with the fractional re-serve banking that accompanies a fiatmonetary system. Giant corporationswho get to borrow large funds at belowmarket interest rates enjoy the systemand consistently call for more inflationand artificially low interest rates.Even the general public seems to ben-efit from the artificial booms broughtabout by credit creation, with lower in-terest rates allowing major purchaseslike homes and cars. The naive and uninformed fully en- dorse the current system because thebenefits are readily available, whilethe disadvantages are hidden, delayedor not understood. The politicians, cen-tral bankers, commercial banks, bigbusiness borrowers, all believe theirneeds justify such a system. But the costs are many and the dan- gers are real. Because of easy creditthroughout this century we have foundout that financing war was easier thanif taxes had to be raised. The manywars we have fought and the contin-uous military confrontations in small-er wars since Vietnam have made the20th Century a bloody century. It ismost likely that we would have pur-sued a less militaristic foreign policy iffinancing it had been more difficult. Likewise, financing the welfare state would have progressed much slower ifour deficits could not have been fi-nanced by an accommodative CentralBank willing to inflate the money sup-ply at will. There are other real costs as well that few are willing to believe are a di-rect consequence of Federal ReserveBoard policy. Rampant inflation afterWorld War I as well as the 1921 depres-sion were a consequence of monetarypolicy during and following the war.The stock market speculation of the1920s, the stock market collapse of 1929and the depression of the 1930s causingmillions to be unemployed, all resultedfrom Federal Reserve Board monetarymischief. Price inflation of the early 1950s was a consequence of monetary inflationrequired to fight the Korean War. Wageand price controls used then totallyfailed, yet the same canard was usedduring the Vietnam war in the early1970s to again impose wage and pricecontrols, with even worse results. All the price inflation, all the distor- tions, all the recessions and unemploy-ment should be laid at the doorstep ofthe Federal Reserve. The Fed is an ac-complice in promoting all unnecessarywar, as well as the useless and harmfulwelfare programs, with its willingnessto cover Congress' profligate spendinghabits. Even though the Fed did great harm before 1971 after the total eliminationof the gold-dollar linkage, the prob-lems of deficit spending, welfare expan-sion and military-industrial complexinfluence have gotten much worse. Although many claim the 1990s have been great economic years, Federal Re-serve Board action of the past decadehas caused problems yet to manifest itself. The inevitable correction willcome as the new century begins, and itis likely to be quite serious. The stage has been set. Rampant monetary growth has led to historichigh asset inflation, massive specula-tion, overcapacity, malinvestment, ex-cessive debt, a negative savings rateand a current account deficit of hugeproportions. These conditions dictate apainful adjustment, something thatwould have never occurred under a goldstandard. The special benefits of foreigners taking our inflated dollars for lowpriced goods and then loaning themback to us will eventually end. The dol-lar must fall, interest rates must rise,price inflation will accelerate, the fi-nancial asset bubble will burst, and adangerous downturn in the economywill follow. There are many reasons to believe the economic slowdown will be world-wide, since the dollar is the reservecurrency of the world. An illusionabout our dollar's value has allowed usto prop up Europe and Japan in thispass decade during a period of weakgrowth for them, but when reality setsin, economic conditions will deterio-rate. Greater computer speed, whichhas helped to stimulate the boom ofthe 1990s, will work in the opposite di-rection as all of the speculative posi-tions unwind, and that includes thetens of trillions of dollars in deriva-tives. There was a good reason the Federal Reserve rushed to rescue long-termcapital management with a multibil-lion dollar bailout: It was unadulter-ated fear that the big correction wasabout to begin. Up until now, feedingthe credit bubble with even more credithas worked, and is the only tool theyhave to fight the business cycle, buteventually control will be lost. A paper money system is dangerous economically and not constitutionallyauthorized. It is also immoral for gov-ernment to counterfeit money, whichdilutes the value of the currency andsteals values from those who hold thecurrency and those who do not nec-essary benefit from its early circula-tion. Not everyone benefits from the lar- gesse of government spending programsor systematic debasement of the cur-rency. The middle class, those not onwelfare and not in the military indus-trial complex suffer the most from ris-ing prices and job losses in the correc-tion phase of the business cycle. Congress must someday restore sound money to America. It is man-dated in the Constitution, it is eco-nomically sound to do so, and it ismorally right to guarantee a standardof value for the money. Our oath of of-fice obligates all Members of Congressto pay attention to this and participate in this needed reform. Police state. A police state is incom- patible with liberty. One hundred yearsago the Federal Government was re-sponsible for enforcing very few laws. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:11 January 31, 2000 This has dramatically changed. There are now over 3,000 Federal laws and10,000 regulations, employing hundredsof thousands of bureaucrats diligentlyenforcing them, with over 80,000 of thebureaucrats carrying guns. We now have an armed national po- lice state, just as Jefferson complainedof King George in the Declaration ofIndependence. ``He has send hitherswarms of officers to harass our peopleand eat out their substance.'' A lot of political and police power has shifted from the state and localcommunities to the Federal Govern-ment over the past 100 years. If a con-stitutional republic is desired and indi-vidual liberty is cherished, this con-centration of power cannot be toler-ated. Congress has been derelict in cre- ating the agencies in the first placeand ceding to the Executive the powerto write regulations and even tax with-out Congressional approval. Theseagencies enforce their own laws and su-pervise their own administrative courtsystem where citizens are consideredguilty until proven innocent. The Con-stitution has been thrown out the win-dow for all practical purposes, and al-though more Americans every daycomplain loudly, Congress does nothingto stop it. The promoters of the bureaucratic legislation claim to have good inten-tions, but they fail to acknowledge thecost, inefficiency or the underminingof individual rights. Worker safety, en-vironmental concerns, drug usage, guncontrol, welfarism, banking regula-tions, government insurance, health in-surance, insurance against economicand natural disaster, and the regula-tion of fish and wildlife. Are just a fewof the issues that prompts the unlim-ited use of Federal regulatory and leg-islative power to deal with perceivedproblems. But, inevitably, for every attempt to solve one problem, government createstwo new ones. National politicians arenot likely to volunteer a market orlocal government solution to a prob-lem, or they will find out how unneces-sary they really are. Congress' careless attitude about the Federal bureaucracy and its penchantfor incessant legislation have promptedserious abuse of every American cit-izen. Last year alone there were morethan 42,000 civil forfeitures of propertyoccurring without due process of law orconviction of a crime, and oftentimesthe owners were not even charged witha crime. Return of illegally ceased property is difficult, and the owner is forced toprove his innocence in order to retrieveit. Even though many innocent Ameri-cans have suffered, these laws havedone nothing to stop drug usage orchange people's attitude toward theIRS. Seizure and forfeitures only make the problems they are trying to solvethat much worse. The idea that a po-lice department under Federal law canseize property and receive direct ben- efit from it is an outrage. The proceedscan be distributed to the various policeagencies without going through thebudgetary process. This dangerous in-centive must end. The national police state mentality has essentially taken over crime inves-tigation throughout the country. Ourlocal sheriffs are intimidated and fre-quently overruled by the national po-lice. Anything worse than writing traf-fic tickets prompts swarms of Federalagents to the scene. We frequently seethe FBI, the DEA, the CIA, the BATF,Fish and Wildlife, the IRS, Federalmarshals and even the Army involvedin local law enforcement. They do notcome to assist, but to take over. The two most notorious examples of federal abuse of police powers wereseen at Ruby Ridge and Waco, wherenon-aggressive citizens were needlesslyprovoked and killed by governmentagents. At Waco, even Army tankswere used to deal with a situation thatthe local sheriff could have easily han-dled. These two incidents are well-known, but thousands of other similar abusesroutinely occur with little publicity.The Federal police state seen in the ac-tion the Ruby Ridge and Waco hope-fully is not a sign of things to come,but it could be, if we are not careful. If the steady growth of the Federal police power continues, the Americanrepublic cannot survive. The Con-gresses of the 20th Century have stead-ily undermined the principle that thegovernment closest to home must dealwith law and order, and not the Fed-eral Government. The Federal courts also have signifi- cantly contributed to this trend. Hope-fully in the new century our supportfor a national police state will be di-minished. We have in this past centurynot only seen the undermining of theFederalism that the Constitution des-perately tried to preserve, but the prin-ciples of separation of powers amongthe three branches of government hasbeen severely compromised as well. The Supreme Court no longer just rules on Constitutionality, but fre-quently rewrites the laws with at-tempts at comprehensive social engi-neering. The most blatant example wasthe Roe v. Wade ruling. The Federalcourt should be hearing a lot fewercases, deferring as often as possible tothe states courts. Throughout the 20th Century, with Congress' obsession for writing laws foreverything, the Federal courts werequite willing to support the idea of ahuge interventionist Federal Govern-ment. The fact that the police officersin the Rodney King case were triedtwice for the same crime, ignoring theconstitutional prohibition against dou-ble jeopardy, was astoundingly con-doned by the courts, rather than con-demned. It is not an encouraging signthat the concept of equal protectionunder the law will prevail.2130 Mr. Speaker, I will yield back the few minutes I have left because I plan tocomplete my special order on this sub-ject on Wednesday evening.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Honorable JIM BUNNING, a Sen- ator from the State of Kentucky, ledthe Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God,indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized. SCHEDULE Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a periodof morning business until 2 p.m. Fol- lowing morning business, the Senatewill resume debate on the bankruptcyreform bill under the previous order.There are a few amendments remain-ing, and those Senators who haveamendments under the agreement areencouraged to work with the bill man-agers on a time to debate their amend-ments. As previously announced, votesordered with respect to the bankruptcylegislation will be stacked to occur onTuesday at a time to be determined. In an effort to complete the bank- ruptcy bill, Senators may expect votesthroughout the day on Tuesday andWednesday. Following completion ofthe bankruptcy bill, the Senate is ex-pected to begin consideration of thenuclear waste legislation. I thank my colleagues for their at- tention. I note the absence of aquorum. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the orderfor the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B UNNING ). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Supreme Court an-nounced recently that it will decidewhether state governments are boundby the Americans with DisabilitiesAct. The issue in the case, Dickson v. Florida, is whether the states are im-mune from suit under the ADA basedon the Constitution's 11th Amendmentimmunity provision for states. Thelegal issues are quite similar to Kimelv. Florida Board of Regents, in whichthe Supreme Court held earlier thismonth that the states cannot be suedunder the Age Discrimination in Em-ployment Act. This case could be critical to a bill I have introduced, the State and LocalPrison Relief Act. This legislation, S. 32, would exclude state prisoners fromcoverage under the ADA. The Dicksoncase underscores the need to accom-plish the purpose of this bill. The Con- gress did not consider all of the poten-tial consequences of enacting the ADA,and its implications on prisons is oneof the best examples. The courts have always deferred to the states in the management of pris-ons. We do not need the federal courtssecond-guessing the states' decisionson how to best manage and control thevolatile prison environment. This is es-pecially true in the face of a statutethat creates very specific legal rightsfor very broad classes of individuals. The Act is detrimental to the safe, orderly operation of state prisons.Moreover, at the very least, it givesprisoners more of an excuse to chal-lenge authority by providing themmore tools to bring frivolous lawsuitsagainst state prisons. Dickson is a case of great signifi- cance. It provides the Supreme Court aunique opportunity to limit the reachof Federal power over state prisons andcontinue its recent affirmation of thepower of the states in our constitu-tional scheme of government. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my un- derstanding we are in a period of morn-ing business now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. REID. I am going to be in control of the time under the control of theDemocratic leader today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until 1 o'clock. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 00:32 Feb January 31, 2000 CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been interested in watching both the Demo-cratic and Republican battles in NewHampshire for the nomination of therespective parties. I was not able towatch personally, but I understandthat yesterday Mr. M CCAIN, the senior Senator from Arizona, was interviewedon one of the national shows andtalked about campaign finance reformand, in effect, the difficult sledding ithas been for him, a Republican, tomove forward on this issue. Based on what the Supreme Court did just last week, I think it is significantto keep our eye on the prize, and thatis to recognize that the Supreme Courthas now given us the latitude and lee-way to be able to do something aboutcampaign finance reform. SenatorM CCAINis to be congratulated for being so responsive to what I think theAmerican public is asking from us.That is to do something about less- ening the need for the huge amounts ofmoney in Federal elections. Senator M CCAINhas been very lonely out there, for being a member of themajority. He has not had a lot of sup-port. I think it has taken a lot of cour-age for him to move forward with cam-paign finance reform. I believe if westart talking about the issue, as I haveheard Governor Bush say: Well, I can'tsupport campaign finance reform be-cause it will simply help theDemocrats\u00d0\u00d0Mr. President, it wouldhelp the American public if people tooka more realistic view regarding thisvital legislation. Let's move forwardwith legislation that will take the de-mand for money out of the mix. I have said it on this floor before, but I think it is worth repeating. In thesmall State of Nevada, with less than 2million people, $23 million was spent inmy last reelection. No one outspent theother. My opponent spent the sameamount of money I did\u00d0a little over $4million, for the individual campaigns.We each spent, through the variousparties, money on our behalf, basically,$6 million each. That is $20 million.Plus, we don't know, but I have esti-mated there was another $3 million onindependent expenditures. That is out of line. It is obnoxious, it is obscene, it is too much money. Wehave to arrive at a point where we haveto take this soft money mix out ofcampaigns. We may not be able to doeverything included in the McCain-Feingold bill that we need to do, butlet's work toward a compromise thatat least takes corporate money out ofcampaigns. Earlier in this century, the decision was made by Congress that corporatemoney should not be allowed in Fed-eral elections. Over the years, that hasworked fine. But in a ruling the Su-preme Court said, well, you still can'tuse corporate money on individualcampaigns, but State parties can use itbasically any way they want. As a re-sult of that, there has been this tre-mendous rush by both parties for cor-porate money, and they spend it on be- half of individual candidates. I thinkthat is wrong. We should reverse thatstatutorily. As I reviewed the SupremeCourt decision, it was clear that, infact, was the case. Justice Souter did avery good job in writing that opinion.It is clear and concise. I think weshould move forward and have cam-paign finance reform. Mr. President, beginning this con- gressional session, the last year of thisCongress, it is important that we re-flect on where we are and where weneed to go. It seems pretty clear wehave made great progress in gettingthe country's fiscal house in order.Just 7 years ago, when President Clin-ton came into office, the yearly budgetdeficit was more than $300 billion, espe-cially if you add in the Social Securitysurplus, which was being used for yearsto mask the annual deficit. Instead ofhaving these $300 billion-plus deficitsevery year, we will now, for the secondyear in a row, have a surplus. It is difficult for those of us who have served in this body for a few years tounderstand that we are now talkingabout what we should do with our sur-plus. During this period of time, wehave created over 20 million new jobs.The vast majority of the jobs are high-wage jobs, good jobs. We have low un-employment, low inflation, strong eco-nomic growth, and lower Governmentspending. We have cut the payroll ofthe Federal Government by over 300,000individuals, excluding the cuts thathave been made within the military. We are doing a much better job. We are at 18.7-percent Federal Governmentspending as a share of gross domesticproduct, and that is the lowest since1974. That is real progress. Real hourlywages are up. We also have strong pri-vate sector growth, and as I have indi-cated, low inflation. The underlyingcore rate of inflation is at its lowestsince 1965. In the last four quarters, theGDP price index has risen only 1.3 per-cent, which is the lowest rate of in-crease since 1963. We are talking about decades and decades of improvement. We have re-duced welfare rolls. Both partiesworked together to bring about lesswelfare. That is important. Not onlyare we seeing people move off the wel-fare rolls, we are putting people towork. We have high-home ownership.We have jobs in the auto industry. Peo-ple said a few years ago that the Amer-ican automobile industry was dead andthat we should forget about againbeing somebody who produces most ofthe cars in the world. That was re-versed because of good decisions bymanagement and tremendous produc-tion by labor. Since 1993, we have added almost 200,000 new auto jobs. The annual rateof adding auto jobs is the fastest wehave ever had. I think we are doingvery well. Regarding the construction industry, all we have to do is look at the Stateof Nevada which leads the Nation, andhas for 14 years, as the fastest growing State in the Union. We have cranes\u00d0some use the old term that it is the``national bird''\u00d0all over the State ofNevada, with construction going on.But Nevada is not the only place; thiscountry is in a period of phenomenaleconomic growth. There are still sec-tors that need improvement, but wehave done fine. We are looking now toimproving people's lives. We are now looking into issues that we never havebefore. I am sure that you, just as the Sen- ator from Nevada, find all this Internetstuff kind of new. It is something wedidn't have when we were growing up,and it has taken some training andsome real education to become some-what computer literate. It is so easy tobecome computer literate. You canorder anything you want off the Inter-net. You can order CDs, water, andmany other items. The other Saturday morning, I turned on my computer to find outwhat the news was in Nevada. Theyhave a little teaser there almost everytime you turn on the computer aboutdifferent services rendered. One of thethings on my computer said, ``Do youwant to sell your house?'' My wife andI, with our children being raised now,are considering moving from our homewhere the kids were raised to a smallerplace. And so I clicked on that littlething on my computer, and within 5minutes, on my screen in McLean, VA,where we have our home locally, Ifound places where homes were sold inthe last 2 years and for how much theywere sold. There is so much on the computer that it is difficult for me to com-prehend. That brings about anotherproblem, and that is our privacy. Is ourprivacy being protected with all thethings happening on the Internet?Some say yes, some say they are nottoo sure, and some say no. This issomething at which we as a Congressneed to take a look. We need extensivehearings to determine how safe infor-mation is on the Internet. Are our medical records being pro- tected? If your wife, your father, yourbrother, your sister goes to the hos-pital, are their records being pro-tected? Is your privacy being pro-tected? Is your credit card protected onthe Internet? Are, in fact, these peoplewho are getting information on the netselling this information to other peo-ple? These are questions raised in thisnew, modern society in which we liveand at which Congress must take alook. We didn't have to look at thosethings just a short time ago. In addition to recognizing that our economy is in great shape, we havethings on which we have to work. Wehave to realize we have new challengesahead of us. Privacy is one of them. I talked about campaign finance re- form. That is so important to us. Weneed to take a look at that. But alsowe have to take a look at what is hap-pening to the health care delivery sys-tem in our country. Every year, over a VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:35 Feb January 31, 2000 million people become uninsured. We have now well over 40 million peoplewho have no health insurance. That isnot something that we can say is some-one else's problem. It is our problem,just as it is someone else's problem. Why do I say that? Because when a person who has no health insurance isin an automobile accident, they go tothe emergency room\u00d0that is the mostexpensive care that can be rendered. Asa result of this, the fact that peoplewho have no health insurance are tak-ing care of that way causes my pre-miums to go up and yours. It causeshigher taxes to be charged for healthcare, and it, of course, causes hospitaland doctor bills to be increased morethan they should to take care of thosepeople who have no health insurance. We must do something about inad- equate health care. The fact is that inAmerica, the most powerful nation inthe world, we have over 40 million peo-ple today with no health insurance. Wecould add in all of the little things peo-ple have talked about such as medicalsavings accounts and all other suchthings. If we added all of those and ac-cepted them\u00d0some would say no, thatis not good, and some of us disagreeabout the way to go. But let's say wedid. We would then take care of onlyabout 3.5 million people, still leavingalmost 40 million people with no healthinsurance. We have to be real and stoptalking about these little gimmicksand start talking about the fact thathealth care is something of which toomany people do not have the benefit.Those people who do not have healthinsurance are being jerked around. The fact is that we have tried to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights giving peoplethe ability to have health insuranceand not to be taken advantage of bybig-interest companies and HMOs. Thatis why we have worked very hard tohave a real Patients' Bill of Rightspassed, one where people can go to aspecialist when they want to; to ahealth care plan that allows a womanto be taken care of by a gynecologistwhen she believes it is necessary; a pro-vision so that when somebody doessomething negligent and wrong, theycan be sued. People don't like lawyersunless they need one themselves. Withhealth care, there are times when peo-ple do things that are wrong. Individ-uals need the right to go to court to re-dress wrongs. We have a lot to do in this Congress. We don't need to come here and boastabout how well we are doing with theeconomy. We need to do somethingabout the campaign finance problemswe have in this country, about ourhealth care delivery system. It is clear, with all that is going on in our country today, that we need tolook at how guns are handled. I havesaid on this floor before and I say againthat I was, in effect, raised with guns.As a 12-year-old boy, I was given a 12-gauge shotgun for my birthday. I stillhave that gun. My parents ordered itout of the Sears & Roebuck catalog. Ilearned how to handle weapons as a young boy. We would hunt and do theother things you do with guns. I havebeen a police officer. I personally havea number of firearms in Nevada. I have no problem with the fact that if I want to purchase a handgun, I tellpeople who I am and they can make adetermination by checking my identi-fication and whether or not I am afelon or in fact mentally unstable.That is what the Brady bill is allabout. Hundreds of thousands of peopleare granted weapons as a result of that.I am willing to be checked each time Ipurchase a gun. I don't think that isunreasonable. But there are those whoare trying to avoid that by going topawnshops and purchasing pistols, and,as a result of that, checks aren'tmade\u00d0or they are going to gun shows.We need to close those loopholes. Hereon this floor last year, we did that.That was done by virtue of Vice Presi-dent G OREbreaking the tie vote. But the problem is, we haven't gone to con-ference. We need to take that loopholeout of the law. The American public be-lieve that is appropriate. We should atleast do that. That is the minimum wecan do with guns. My knowledge about weapons is, I think, average or above, and I don'tneed an assault weapon to go huntingor to protect my family. These assaultweapons need some restrictions placedon them. I am a believer in the secondamendment. Nothing that I havetalked about today deprives anyone oftheir second amendment rights. In this Congress, I hope we can work in a bipartisan fashion to solve some ofthese problems that everyone recog-nizes: Campaign finance reform, healthcare, problems with guns in our soci-ety, and other things on which we needto work together to come up with bi-partisan solutions to the problems thatface this country. One of the things we worked very hard on last year as a minority\u00d0wehope the majority will join with us thisyear\u00d0was to do something about rais-ing the minimum wage. Why is it im-portant that we raise the minimumwage? That is all the money some peo-ple get to support their family. In fact,60 percent of the people who draw min-imum wage are women, and for 40 per-cent of those women who draw min-imum wage, that is the only moneythey get for themselves and their fami-lies. It is important that we increasethe minimum wage. The minimumwage is something more than a bunchof kids at McDonald's flipping ham-burgers; it is for people who need tosupport their families. Speaking for the minority, we reach out our hands to the majority. We wantto work with the majority to passmeaningful legislation. But I also saywe want to approach legislation in theway it has been traditionally handledin this body: For example, the bank-ruptcy bill, which at 2 o'clock thisafternoon will be brought up and wewill move forward. We have workedvery hard in spite of the fact that there are in the minority some people whosupport the underlying legislation andsome who don't support the legislation.But we have worked to move this legis-lation forward to have the battles hereon the Senate floor. That is why wewere disappointed at the end of the lastsession when the majority leader filedcloture on this legislation when therewere only a few amendments left thatwould take up any time at all. As a re-sult of that, some of us joined togetherduring the break and said: We are notgoing to let this legislation move for-ward, we are going to have 45 Demo-crats voting against cloture, until wehave the opportunity to debate thesemeasures which we believe are impor-tant. What were the two things holding it up? One was legislation that said donot do violence to a clinic that givesadvice on birth control measures andgives counsel to people as to whetheror not they should terminate a preg-nancy. This is something that is en-forced by the laws in this country. TheU.S. Supreme Court ruled that thesekinds of clinics are legal. Whether ornot you agree or disagree with abortionis not the issue. A person has no rightto throw acid in these facilities and doeverything they can to stop the busi-ness from going forward. There havebeen lawsuits filed against people whodo this. This amendment says if you dothat, you can't discharge that debt inbankruptcy. That is what this amend-ment is all about. We are going to have an opportunity to vote on this in the next few days.That is the way it should be. The other amendment that was hold- ing things up and caused cloture to befiled was an amendment by the Senatorfrom Michigan that says if you manu-facture guns and there is a lawsuitfiled against you because of somethingyou did which was wrong, you can'tdischarge that debt in bankruptcy. Iam paraphrasing the amendment. Sen-ator L EVIN will explain it in more de- tail. But we have said, no matter how you feel on the gun issue and abortion,these are issues that have nothing todo directly with these issues; this issuedeals with bankruptcy. As a result ofthat, the minority held firm. I applaud the majority leader. He withdrew the motion for cloture. Weare going to debate this and completethis legislation in the next couple ofdays. We are willing to work with themajority if we go through the normallegislative process allowing us to bringup our amendment. We worked hard totry to reduce the number of amend-ments. Some amendments are difficult.Some amendments we don't want tovote on, but that is what we are electedto do\u00d0vote on tough issues. We can'tavoid those tough votes by filing clo-ture and knocking all of these amend-ments out. Again, on behalf of the minority, we look forward to a productive session VerDate 27-JAN-2000 00:32 Feb January 31, 2000 and we will do everything we can to make sure we not only keep the econ-omy moving but also handle some ofthe more difficult issues that face us inthis society. I suggest the absence of a quorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I intend to take a few minutes this afternoon totalk about the prescription drug issuefor senior citizens. As many of our col-leagues know, I have made it clear thatI am going to come to the floor repeat-edly between now and the end of thesession in the hope we will get a bipar-tisan piece of legislation through thisbody that will meet the needs of somany vulnerable older people. In the past, I have come to the floor and have read two or three of the casesI have been getting from seniors acrossthe country. A lot of these older peo-ple, when they are finished payingtheir prescription drug bills, have onlya few hundred dollars a month onwhich to live. Picture that: After youhave paid your prescription drug bill,you pay for your food, your rent andutilities, and you have virtually noth-ing left over. I think it is extremely important this Congress pass legislation to meetthose needs. I have teamed up for morethan a year with Senator O LYMPIA SNOWE from Maine. We have a bill that is market oriented. It would avoidsome of the cost-shifting problems thatwe might see with other approaches.We want to make sure that as we helpsenior citizens, we do not have to costshift it over to somebody who is, say,27 or 28 and just getting started with afamily and having trouble with theirown medical bills. The Snowe-Wydenlegislation avoids that kind of ap-proach. The reason I am taking a moment to speak this afternoon is because thecomments made by the President lastweek at the State of the Union Addressopened up a very wide berth for theCongress to address this issue in a bi-partisan way. Prior to the President'scomments, I know there was wide-spread concern by a variety of groupsas to what he would say about the issueand how he would say it. What the President of the United States said in the State of the UnionAddress on this issue of prescriptiondrugs seems to me to capture our chal-lenge. First and foremost, the President made it very clear he is aware that inevery nook and cranny of this countrythere are scores of senior citizens whocannot afford their medicine. They simply cannot afford it. His remarksspoke to the millions of older people inthis country who walk on an economictightrope; every month they balancetheir food bill against their fuel billand their fuel bill against their med-ical costs. After the President described this great need, he did not get into any ofthe particulars of writing a bill. Hemade it clear he wanted to work withthe Congress to get a bipartisan pieceof legislation that will meet the needsof older people. Yes, he has his approach. His ap- proach\u00d0and I am not going to get intoall of the fairly complicated details\u00d0involves a role for what are calledpharmacy benefit managers, PBMs. The Snowe-Wyden legislation that has been proposed takes a slightly dif-ferent approach. We use private enti-ties which, in effect, will have to com-pete for the senior citizens' business. We think that makes sense as a way to hold down the costs of medicine forolder people because it has worked forMembers of Congress. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is modeled after thehealth care system to which Membersof Congress belong. I have been asked again and again whether you could reconcile the Presi-dent's approach, in terms of usingpharmacy benefit managers, and thekind of approach that is taken in theSnowe-Wyden legislation, with theseprivate entities that would have tocompete for senior citizens' businesses.I think it is possible to reconcile thesetwo approaches. I think we are makinga lot of headway now in terms of ad-dressing this issue, in terms of the par-ties saying the need is urgent. We have to come together, in a bipar- tisan way, to do it. The Presidentopened up a real opportunity for theCongress to come together on this mat-ter. The reason it is so important, of course, is that we cannot afford, as anation, not to cover prescription medi-cine. I repeat that. People ask if we canafford to cover prescription drugs forolder people. The reality is, our coun-try cannot afford not to cover prescrip-tion drugs. A lot of these drugs today are preven- tive in nature. They reduce problemsrelated to blood pressure and choles-terol. I have talked a number of timeson the floor about the anticoagulantdrugs which prevent strokes. Perhapsit would cost $1,000 a year to meet theneeds of an older person's prescriptionsfor these anticoagulant drugs. Sure, $1,000 or $1,500 is a lot of money, but ifyou have a legislative opportunity tohelp an older person in that way, andyou save $100,000, which you can do be-cause those drugs help to preventstrokes\u00d0and strokes can be very ex-pensive, even upwards of $100,000\u00d0thatis something our country should notpass up. The elderly in this country get hit with a double whammy when it comesto pharmaceuticals.First, Medicare does not cover pre- scription drugs. It has been that waysince the program began in 1965. I donot know a soul who studied the Medi-care program, who, if they were design-ing it today, would not cover prescrip-tion drugs simply for the reasons Ihave given, that they are preventive innature. The other part of the double wham- my for older people is that the big buy-ers\u00d0the health maintenance organiza-tions, the health plans, a variety ofthese big organizations\u00d0are able to getdiscounts; and then when an old per-son, a low-income older person, walksinto a pharmacy, in effect, they haveto pay a premium because the big buy-ers get the discounts. So this is an important issue for the Congress to address. As I have done in the past, I want to put into perspective exactly what somany of these vulnerable people arefacing in our country. I see our friend from Michigan. I want to make sure he has time as well.Democrats have a few more minutes. Iwant to make sure my colleague can beheard, as well. But one of the cases I want to touch on this afternoon follows a 65-year-oldsenior from West Linn, OR. He wroteme recently as part of the campaign Ihave organized to have older peoplesend in their bills. He wrote me that heused to have prescription drug cov-erage when he was working. Now hehas no coverage at all. He is takingmedication for high blood pressure, forhigh cholesterol, for heart-relatedproblems. He had triple bypass surgery in 1991 and anticipates he is going to betaking medications for the rest of hislife. He found that, as he tried to shop for medicines, the cost was 18 percenthigher than when he had insurancecoverage, which illustrates the doublewhammy that I described. When he was in the workforce\u00d0and the Senator from Michigan knows a lotabout this as a result of the company-retiree packages that autoworkers andothers have\u00d0the workers were in a po-sition to get a bargain. But then thatsenior retired and lost the opportunityto have some leverage in the market-place. That senior in West Linn foundthat his prescription prices were 18 per-cent higher. This person from West Linn has writ- ten, saying he hopes the bipartisanSnowe-Wyden legislation is successful. We have received scores and scores of other letters. Because my friend fromMichigan is here, and I want to allowhim time to talk, I am going to wrapup only by way of saying that the lastcase I was going to go into in more de-tail is an older woman in eastern Or-egon, just outside Pendleton, OR, whotold me during the last recess thatwhen she is done paying her prescrip-tion drug bill, she has only $200 amonth on which to live for the rest ofthe month. Perhaps other people can figure out some sort of financial sleight of hand VerDate 27-JAN-2000 00:32 Feb January 31, 2000 so they can get by on a couple hundred dollars a month for their food and util-ities and housing, and the like, butthat is not math that I think adds up. We need to address this issue in a bi- partisan way. The Snowe-Wyden legis-lation does that. I was particularly en-couraged by the President's remarkslast week on prescription drugs be-cause I think, through the conciliatoryapproach that he took, making it clearthat he wants to work with all partiesto get this addressed, we now have awindow to climb through to get the jobdone and provide a real lifeline to mil-lions of older people. That is some goodnews for our country. Mr. President, I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B URNS ). The Senator from Michigan. Mr. LEVIN. First, I congratulate, again, the good Senator from Oregonfor his leadership in the area of pre-scription drugs. His effort to achieve abipartisan move in this direction isvery critical to the Nation. I commendhim for it. I thank him for truncating his re- marks a few minutes so I might have afew minutes. I hope I can complete thisin 2 or 3 minutes. But if I do not, per-haps I could ask my good friend on theother side of the aisle to be able to ex-tend it a minute or two beyond the ap-pointed hour of 1 o'clock. SECRET EVIDENCE SUSPENSION Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Na- tion's commitment to due process hasbeen placed in doubt by the use of se-cret evidence in immigration pro-ceedings. Until recently, the Department of Justice's use of secret evidence was notwell known to the general public. Se-cret evidence was known only to someimmigrants who have been held formonths, sometimes years, without anyopportunity to confront their accusersor examine the evidence against them. As the Washington Post of October 19, 1997, put it, the process is author-ized by: [A] little-known provision of immigration law in effect since the 1950s allows secret evi-dence to be introduced in certain immigra-tion proceedings. The classified information,usually from the FBI, is shared with judges,but withheld from the accused and their law-yers. The use of secret evidence in immi- gration proceedings threatens to vio-late basic principles of fundamentalfairness. The only three Federal courtsto review its use in the last decadehave all found it unconstitutional. Yetthe Immigration and NaturalizationService, the INS, continues to use itand to do so virtually without any lim-iting regulations. Under current law,the INS takes the position that it canpresent evidence in camera and exparte whenever it is classified evidencerelevant to an immigrant's applicationfor admission, an application for an im-migration benefit, a custody deter-mination, or a removal proceeding.The Attorney General herself has ex- pressed concern over the use of secretevidence\u00d0and for good reason. In October 1999, a district court de- clared the INS' use of secret evidenceto detain aliens unconstitutional. Fivedays later, the INS dropped its effortsto deport a man it had held for over ayear and a half on the basis of secretevidence. In November 1999, the Board of Immi- gration Appeals ruled that an Egyptianman detained on secret evidence for 3and-a-half years should be released,and the Attorney General declined tointervene to continue his detention. Earlier in 1999, the Board of Immigra- tion Appeals, the BIA, granted perma-nent resident status to a Palestinianagainst whom the INS had used secretevidence and alleged national securityconcerns. In all of these cases the gov- ernment claimed that national secu-rity was at risk, yet in none of themwere the individuals even charged withcommitting any criminal acts. The Attorney General has promised to promulgate regulations to governthe INS's use of secret evidence, buthas not yet done so. In May of 1999, theAttorney General came to my state ofMichigan to meet with Arab-Americanleaders and members of the MichiganCongressional delegation to discussconcerns about the use of secret evi-dence. At that meeting, she said shewould implement a new policy, one inwhich the Department would imple-ment a higher level of review, and takeextra precautions before using secretevidence. She said she would havethose regulations relative to the use ofsecret evidence within a reasonabletime. In December, the Attorney General visited Michigan again. She had stillnot promulgated the promised regula-tions. She told us that she was dedi-cated to resolving this issue, and shewas actively reviewing draft regula-tions, but that she was uncomfortableissuing those regulations in the formthey had been presented to her by herstaff. Mr. President, the Attorney General may eventually offer the promised reg-ulations. But at the current time, sheis not capable of putting a process inwriting that is satisfactory even toher. It has been almost nine monthsnow since the Attorney General agreedto look in to this matter, and promul-gate regulations that will govern theuse of this process. Under these cir-cumstances, when the Attorney Gen-eral cannot even satisfy herself that afair process is in place, the use of thissecret process should be suspendeduntil she can, and I urge the Attorney General to do exactly that: suspend theuse of secret evidence in immigrationproceedings immediately until she canpromulgate regulations relative to itsuse. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wyoming. Mr. THOMAS. What section are we in now, Mr. President?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senate is in morningbusiness until 2 p.m. THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take a little time to talk a bit aboutour agenda and the things I think mostof us hope we will accomplish duringthis coming legislature. There are some who believe we won't accomplish much. It seems to me thatis not a good prognosis. The fact is, weshould put some priorities on the manyissues that are there and, indeed, makea special effort to accomplish a gooddeal. I think we can. Many of the issueshave been talked about a great deal al-ready. We know what the backgroundsare. I think now our commitment is to decide what the priorities are for thiscountry, what the priorities are forthis Congress, and to set out to accom-plish them. We heard the President last Thurs- day make a very long speech, includinga very long list of ideas and things heis suggesting we consider. I don't be-lieve he is suggesting certainly thatthey all be done. He knows very wellthat will not be the case. I think it isup to us, particularly the majorityparty, to establish an agenda of thosethings we believe are most important. I read in the paper that some Demo- crats in the House are saying we aren'tgoing to accomplish anything unlesswe set the agenda, and we will talk ourway through that. I am very dis-appointed in that kind of an idea. Ofcourse, it is possible to continue toraise all these issues that one knowsare not going anywhere. I suspect thatis not a new idea even in this body. Butwe need to have a set of priorities. The President had 100-plus ideas that, I suppose, were set forth to layout a political agenda, maybe largelyfor this election. That is fine. It is nota brand new idea. I am surprised theagenda pointed in a different directionthan that with which the President hassought to characterize himself over thelast several years. He talked about theleadership council and starting towardsthe center, saying, I think some timeago, that the era of big government isover. One would not have suspectedthat, as they listened last Thursdaynight to his view, that the era of biggovernment is over. It was a very liberal agenda laid out, I am sure, for conduct of this session ofCongress. I suggest that is not the di-rection we ought to take. Expendituresof some $400 billion in additional pro-grams, $400 billion in spending, some $4billion a minute during that process,with very little detail, of course, as tohow it is done but, rather, here are thethings we ought to do, sort of in abroad sense. We need to ensure that the descrip- tion of what we are going to do doesnot interfere with us doing something.We have an agenda. Much of it I am VerDate 27-JAN-2000 00:32 Feb January 31, 2000 hopeful the President will agree with and the Members on the other side ofthe aisle will agree with. Certainly Iam not excited about the idea the mi-nority party will set the agenda, justsimply by the discussions that go onendlessly. When it comes to spending,of course, there are many of us in thisbody who were sent here by our con-stituents to see if we can't limit thegrowth of Government, and we havesucceeded some in the last coupleyears. Even though it was a large one,the growth in last year's budget wassomething around 3 percent, which wasabout the inflation rate, which is con-siderably less than it has been over thelast 10 years, where the rate has goneup much higher than that. Did we hold down spending enough? No, I don't believe so. To do that, wehave to have a little different systemthis year. Hopefully, we will do that. I think we are already beginning to dealwith the budget, with the appropria-tions, so that we don't end up at theend of the session with a huge bill thatmany people are not even familiar withall the content. So we need to do that. I am one who believes we ought to be setting about to hold down the size ofthe Federal Government rather than toexpand it. I am one who believes thereis a limit to the kinds of things theFederal Government is designed to do.I think that is very clear in the Con-stitution. We have exceeded that inmany ways, but it is not too late totake a look at what we are doing andsay, is that the appropriate thing forthe Federal Government to do? Arethese the things the Federal Govern-ment can do better than any other gov-ernment? I don't think so. When wetalk about States and the differenceswe have among States, certainly, I come from a State that is the eighthlargest State in the Union, one of thesmallest in population. Our needs andmethods of delivery of health care, themanagement of public lands, all thosethings are quite different in Wyomingthan they are in Rhode Island or Penn-sylvania, and properly so, which seemsto me to be a good indication that weshould not be continuing to have theone-size-fits-all kind of Federal pro-nouncements from the Congress andfrom the bureaucracy in Washington. One of the things I hope we do over time is change our system to biennialbudgeting, where we have a budgetthat lasts for 2 years. It seems to me itis very appropriate to do that. MostStates do it that way. For one thing,the agencies then have a longer time toknow what their spending restrictionsare for a period of 2 years. Maybe moreimportantly, however, we have an op-portunity to exercise the oversightwhich is the responsibility of Congress,which we don't do very well. Unfortu-nately, we spend so much of our timeon appropriations and other thingsthat the idea of ensuring that the lawswhich are passed are carried out con-sistent with the intent of the law issomething we don't spend enough timedoing.I want to come back to the floor next week and talk a little bit about thatprovision in, I think, a 1996 law whichprovides that regulations that are puttogether by the bureaucracies mustcome to the House and the Senate to bereviewed. Seldom does that ever hap-pen. I think only one or two times hasthere been some kind of a motion tochange those, and none have succeededbecause the system is not workable. Agreat idea, and we have that in mostlegislatures where there is oversight ofthe legislature by the regulations thatcome out to augment the laws thathave been passed. We don't do thathere. So we ought to hold down spend- ing. We ought to have smaller Govern-ment. We ought to seek to review thekinds of things the Federal Govern-ment has involved itself in and ensurethat there are reasonable things thatare best done here. That doesn't meanthere isn't a role for government. Ofcourse there is. But often that role canbe best implemented at the State andlocal level. We need to talk about reducing the Federal debt in a real way. We havebeen doing some work on that for thefirst time in 40 years, I think. We havenot spent Social Security. We balancedthe budget for the first time in 25years. We are using Social Securitymoney to pay down the publicly helddebt, which is a good idea. It reducesthe cost of that debt. It takes the So-cial Security money out of the oppor-tunity to be spent. That is good. Never-theless, the key there is that it is re-ducing publicly held debt. We are re-placing one debt with another kind ofdebt. When these young people are eli-gible for benefits from Social Security,those dollars that have been put into atrust fund to replace debt will have tobe recovered from the taxpayers atthat time. So we need to do somethingmore than that. In my opinion, we ought to set about to figure out some kind of a processover a period of time that we commitourselves to a payment each year topay off the debt out of operating funds, that we do it much like a mortgage onyour home. We can decide that we willpay off $15 billion, or whatever it is,each year, and do that over a period oftime. That would be real debt reduc-tion. That would be reduction thatwould help to keep the so-called sur-plus from being spent to increase thesize of Government. So we can do thatand reduce our debt in a real way. We also, hopefully, will pursue\u00d0when we have a surplus\u00d0what are consideredto be the real needs of the Federal Gov-ernment, and after we secure Social Se-curity and pay down some of the debt,that money will then be returned tothe taxpayers so it can be used to buoythe economy. Otherwise, frankly, themoney left floating around is going tobe spent. If you don't like the conceptof increasingly large Government,when there is money beyond whatthere is a target for, then it ought tobe sent back to the people who paid itin in the beginning.What are the priorities? They are pretty clear. They have been the samefor several years and will continue tobe. I think that is where we ought tofocus. Certainly, most people wouldconsider education to be the issue weare most concerned with\u00d0having anopportunity for all young people tohave an education. Obviously, money isnot the total answer. There has to beaccountability, training, and therehave to be things that happen withinthe school system in addition tomoney. You can't do it without money,however; it is essential. Health care is one issue, obviously, about which everybody is concerned.We are trying to do some things aboutthat. We need to continue to do that. Iam proud of the health care system wehave in this country, certainly interms of quality. On the other hand, wehave to start to be a little carefulabout what that quality costs\u00d0afford-ability. But we can do some thingsabout the health care. Social Security. There is no question but that we have to change Social Se-curity if we are to have it for theseyoung people who start to pay in thevery moment they get a job, and mostof whom now don't expect to have ben-efits in 30, 40, 50 years. We need tochange it so that the benefits will bethere. There are several alternativesthat can be used to change that. Cer-tainly there needs to be a continued re-duction in taxes. In education, I am proud of what we have done so far. This GOP Congressprovided more funding in the last yearthan the President requested. We didget into a hassle, of course, about howthe money is spent. You may recall thePresident insisted it be spent on 100,000teachers. I can tell you, there areschools where I live where additionalteachers are not the issue; there areother things that need to be done. Sowe need to give the flexibility to theState and local school boards as to howthey spend the money to strengtheneducation. We will insist on that beingpart of the system we produce thisyear. The elementary and secondaryeducation bill this year, I hope, will bepassed for safe schools and keeping theparents involved, and particularlymaking sure that all children have achance for quality education. I am interested, of course, in access to education in rural communities. Iam also particularly, for a number ofreasons, and personally interested inspecial education for special kids. Mywife has been a special educationteacher for 25 years, and I am veryproud of that. Education will be oneissue we will continue to press on. Health care, of course, we will con- tinue to have on our agenda, and it willbe one of the most important things wepass. We passed a number of things lastyear. In my State, for example, insmall towns, we have hospitals thatwon't be able to have a full series ofservices and up until now could not becertified and did not receive dollars VerDate 27-JAN-2000 00:32 31, 2000 from HCFA. We changed that so they can be something much like a clinicand have emergency care, so patientscan be transferred on\u00d0sort of a wheel-and-hub concept. We did that last year. Certainly, we need to increase the funding for Medicare and hospitals andall kinds of service providers. A Patients' Bill of Rights, we will be working to try to do something onthat. The controversy basically is howyou have appeals. There have beenchanges, apparently, on the part of thehealth care providers, managed careproviders, to provide more medical de-cisionmaking in the process, which isexactly what we need, rather thanlegal or nonmedical accounting kindsof decisions. So we need to pass thatthis year. I feel confident we will. Itwill be a priority. I also believe we will make some real progress\u00d0and it is time to makeprogress\u00d0with regard to pharma-ceuticals. We can do that. Actually,health care is something of which weshould be quite proud. We have thegreatest health care in the world. Wealso have great problems with the ris-ing costs of health care. There areproblems with HMOs and access tosome breakthrough drugs. We have toomany uninsured. Despite that, we havegreat health care, and I think it islargely because we continue to keep itin the private sector. We need to ensure that our seniors can continue to have Medicare andthat it covers their needs. We probablyneed to look at another change, somestructural changes, so that there arechoices there, where a Medicare recipi-ent can stay where they are if they likeor, indeed, set up a little like the Fed-eral health program, where you havesome choices. If you would like to adddollars to it, you can go to a differentcoverage than the basic one you had. Ithink we can do that. I mentioned the bill of rights. It looks as if we will be able to resolvethat this time, the emphasis being ondecisions being made by medical pro-viders as opposed to the economic peo-ple in the managed care system. Wewill be doing more research, of course,on insured, which continues to be aproblem we will be able to persist with,I believe; and I don't think we willsolve that by just putting a ton ofmoney out there without making somechanges. I mentioned education, of course, and we will continue to work at that. Ithink our focus will continue to befunding with local decisions beingmade. Social Security. I think there are resolutions on Social Security. Wheth-er we will get to it this year, I don'tknow. I hope so. I think we should. Al-most everyone agrees that if we con-tinue to do what we have been doing,we won't be able to pay the benefits atthe end of this period. Much of it issimply the change in the structure ofour society. I think when we startedSocial Security back in the thirties,there were 25 or 30 people working for every beneficiary. Now there are three.We are readily on the way to havingtwo. So a change would be substantially in the nature of how we pay for SocialSecurity. One of the opportunities of change, of course, would be to decrease benefits.Not many people are for that. Somewould say we could increase taxes. TheSocial Security tax is the largest taxthat most people pay these days. The third one is to increase the re- turn we have on the money in the trustfund. It seems to me to be a very log-ical opportunity for us to take a por-tion of the money people pay in\u00d0Ithink the caveat is that probably formost people over 50 or 55 it would notchange; they would continue to go onas they are, but for younger people whoare starting to pay in, part of their So-cial Security payment would be putinto an individual account that isowned by that person. It would be in-vested in their behalf by contractorsand it would be invested in equities. Itcould be in equities. It could be inbonds. It could be a combination ofthat, such as the plan for Federal em-ployees. You could raise substantiallythe return on that money. Over a pe-riod of a person's lifetime of paying in,it would make a great deal of dif-ference and probably ensure that thosebenefits would be there at the end of aperiod of time. Significant change? Sure. Difficult to make? Of course. But it can be made.When you get to the options, then atleast in my judgment that could be-come the option. Those are some of the things I think are most important to us. We find our-selves now faced with a great oppor-tunity to put together a priority agen-da for this year. The majority party will be doing that and has done that. Itwill include education. It will includehealth care. It will include Social Se-curity. It will include paying down thedebt. It will include some kind of taxrelief on an equitable basis. It seems to me that those are the things we ought to put in as priorities.It is great to list the whole thing. It isgreat to go into great debates and fili-busters almost by offering everythingon the floor that you know is not goingto happen, but I am hopeful we do notfind ourselves in the position of raisingissues more for the political benefitthey might have in the election year asopposed to finding resolutions to thoseissues. It seems to me that is the chal-lenge that lies before us. I am very pleased to be joined during this hour by one of the leaders of ourparty, the chairman of our Policy Com-mittee, the Senator from Idaho. I yield to the Senator from Idaho.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Idaho is recognized. Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Wyoming foryielding. Let me also join him in his analysis, and certainly the hope that he speaksto as it relates to an agenda that the Congress might direct itself towardthis year, away from, of course, thepitfalls of the kind of political rhetoricthat I think we oftentimes find our-selves in especially in Presidentialelection years. We are now well intothis Presidential year. THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor as one who spent over 90 min-utes on the floor of the House lastweek listening to the President's Stateof the Union Message. For a few moments, I would like to kind of analyze that State of the UnionAddress as seen through the eyes ofthis Senator reflective of what I be-lieve to be, shall I say, self-evidenttruth. There is no question that our Presi- dent is a gifted speaker. He waxed elo-quently while spending our children'sheritage and vastly increasing the sizeand the parental meddling of our Gov-ernment by all of the new programsthat he has proposed to create whileclaiming credit for virtually everygood thing that has happened in thelast century, including those thingswhich were accomplished despite hisopposition and his veto. I say: Lyndon Johnson, move over; you heard a speech the other nightthat would cause your ghost to shud-der. You had the record as being thebiggest spending Government creatorsince FDR. Let me propose that thisPresident is now vying for first place. Let me start by analyzing his spend- ing spree. In his speech, President Clinton called for continued fiscal disciplinewhile at the same time suggesting thatwe do a lot of other things and buyingdown the Federal debt. I say, Mr. President, what hypocrisy. Until the Republican Congress imposedfiscal discipline, until the Americanpeople demanded fiscal discipline, thePresident consistently proposed budg-ets with spending and debt and deficitsas far as the average person's eye couldsee and the greatest prognosticator of the Office of Management and Budgetcould look in his crystal ball and pre-dict. He didn't refuse to stray from thepath of fiscal discipline. He simply didit. We forced him to get to that path.That election occurred in 1994. Weknow the rest of that story. Yet whathas he proposed in his last State of theUnion Message? The Senate Budget Committee made a preliminary estimate of the newspending proposed by the President atabout $343 billion. That is about $3.8billion a minute for his 89-minutespeech. Not bad spending, Mr. Presi-dent\u00d0the most expensive speech givenin the history of this country, I sug-gest. If the Treasury can only printabout $262 billion a year with the press- es running nearly 24 hours a day, youeven outspent, Mr. President, the abil-ity of the U.S. Treasury to print it. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 00:32 Feb January 31, 2000 What about the taxpayers whose earnings the President would spend sofreely? Last week, the Congressional Budget Office, using its most pessimistic esti-mate, announced that there would bean $838 billion non-Social Security sur-plus over the next 10 years. That isphenomenal. That is wonderful for thiscountry. Yet the Clinton speech men-tioned he would give back only about$250 billion of it. That is less than 30percent of the excessive income taxpaid by the American people who that$838 billion represents. However, eventhis paltry $250 billion tax cut wasn'treal. Much of it is disguised in newspending. Even the Washington Post,sometimes as difficult as it finds criti-cizing the President, said that he hasartfully couched many of these new taxcuts in new spending programs. Thankyou, Washington Post, for pointingthat out. What is worse? This $343 billion in spending is just the tip of the iceberg,and the American taxpayers are ridingon a potential Titanic. The Clinton version of government is not the end of big government as weknow it. That is what he said a fewyears ago. But then again let's remem-ber the source. It is Bill Clinton. More intrusive government? How about that. Less personal responsibility? I think that was the message our Presidentspoke to so clearly last week. So let's talk about where he is, where I believe a Republican Congress is, andwhat I hope in the end we are able todo about it. The President says he wants to make schools accountable\u00d0but to the Fed-eral Government. The Republicanswant to make schools accountable\u00d0butto the parents and to the young peoplewho will be educated there. It takesWashington too long to realize theproblems. Parents who deal with theirchildren on a day-to-day basis knowwhat the problem is very quickly. According to the Heritage Founda- tion, one-third of college freshmentake remedial classes because our ele-mentary and secondary schools arefailing to teach them some of the ba-sics. Those are the students luckyenough to go on to college. These kidsdon't need the Princeton Review, asthe President suggests. They needquality teachers who are accountableto parents and the local school board. What about health care?In 1994, President Clinton tried to re- make a national health care system inthis country in the image of the U.S.Post Office. Thanks to bipartisan oppo-sition he failed. The world recognizedit, and our public cheered. In 1996, he vowed to push for Govern- ment-run health care ``a step at a timeuntil eventually we finish this.'' Thoseare his words. He would go after healthcare ``a step at a time''\u00d0that is Gov-ernment-run health care\u00d0until ``even-tually finish this.'' ``This'' meaning,of course, his U.S. Post Office-stylehealth care system. Now the President has renewed his commitment to Gov-ernment-run health care with legisla-tion that would cancel the private cov-erage of over 2 million Americans so hecan push them a step at a time into anexpensive Government-run program. Then there was that great but very soft and smooth Federal land grabstatement he made the other evening.The President said: Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, pro-tect our coastlines, save our national treas-ures. . . . What he wants to do is annually take several billion dollars of oil and gasroyalties paid to the Federal Govern-ment and buy more land and make itFederal Government land. If he is suc-cessful, it means Congress will have tofind $2 billion elsewhere to fund pro-grams. But more importantly, the ra-tios of private versus public ownershipwould change. The Government alreadyowns 1 out of every 4 acres of thelandmass of this country, primarily inWestern States; 63 percent of my Stateis owned by the Federal Government.Idahoans do not want Bill Clinton buy-ing one more acre of Idaho. Why? Thatis the tax base that funds our localgovernments and funds our schools. So,Mr. President, we won't give you thatmoney. We should not give you thatmoney. If the environment needs pro-tection, we can find the necessary re-sources without giving you a blankcheck to buy more Federal land. Mr. President, the very infrastruc- ture of our National Park System isfalling apart. How about putting somemoney there? That is where the Amer-ican public wants to go recreate. Giveour parks a chance to catch up withthe traffic instead of shutting themdown or closing people out of them.Let's let people into our parks. Let'sinvest in them. We don't need to buymore property; we need to take care ofthat which we have. The President said: The major security threat this country will face will come from enemies of the na-tion state: the narcotraffickers and the ter-rorists and the organized criminals. He boasts about ``agreements to re- strain nuclear programs in North Korea''\u00d0a program for direct U.S. sub-sidies for one of the most vicious, anti-American, terrorist-supporting, drug-trafficking regimes in the world, re-sponsible for deaths of millions of itsown people? Mr. President, I don'tquite understand your priorities. He is patting himself on the back for victory in Kosovo, a victory thatmeans planting American troops in analliance with what is known to be anorganization of narcotrafficking ter-rorists and organized criminal cartels. Mr. President, I am not quite sure you have made yourself quite clear tothe American people. I think you aresaying one thing when your actionsclearly demonstrate you are doingsomething else. The President highlights the needs for ``curbing the flow of lethal tech-nology to Iran.'' The Republican Con- gress passed a bill that would havedone just that, the Iran Missile Pro-liferation Sanctions Act of 1997, that isH.R. 2709. And what happened on June23 of 1998? The President vetoed it. Re-markably, President Clinton continuesto support paper agreements ratherthan U.S. actions to keep Americanssecure. Although he outlined realthreats from ballistic missile prolifera-tion in his speech, President Clintonrefuses to deploy a national ballisticmissile defense system to protectAmericans from ballistic missile at-tacks. He even signed legislation call-ing for the deployment of such a sys-tem, although, in typical Clinton fash-ion, he has found many excuses to rein-terpret the straightforward language ofthat legislation. Instead of defendingAmerica against a clear and presentdanger, the President hides behind out-dated, ineffective, and obsolete armscontrol treaties. Because of President Clinton, Ameri- cans remain defenseless against bal-listic missile attack. It is interesting;the President is now calling for ``con-structive bipartisan dialog'' on a Com-prehensive Test Ban Treaty when theadministration turned a deaf ear to thecritical national security concernsbeing voiced by Republicans for thelast good many months. Despite President Clinton's best ef- forts to underfund and overextend U.S.military forces, it has been a Repub-lican Congress that has consistentlysent the President bills to keep ourforces well trained and well equippedand properly paid. It was a RepublicanCongress that initiated the bill to im-prove the quality of life of our soldiers,sailors, airmen, and Marines, andhelped retain those who were leavingwho had already gained the kind of spe-cial skills that are so necessary in ourmilitary. Hyperbole? Hypocrisy? Exaggeration? Shame on me for even suggesting that. The President claimed credit in his speech for most of the good news inAmerica for the past several decades\u00d0the healthy economy, welfare reform,falling crime rates, balanced budgets, acleaner environment, smaller Federalworkforces, and social progress. Any-body who sits in the Presidency andpossesses the bully pulpit when timesare good can make claim and takecredit, but just for a few moments letme talk about how it got done. Mr. President, you are entitled to take credit but you can't steal Repub-lican principles, Republican ideas, andthe kind of work that went on in theCongress to make it happen. The Presi-dent claimed that he ended welfare aswe know it\u00d0after he vetoed it twice.Shame on you, Mr. President. It was aRepublican Congress but, more impor-tantly, it was Republican Governorsout in the States who reformed wel-fare. We copied them. We didn't havethe genius here. We were stuck in theold bureaucracy. We wanted to talkabout reform but we took the ideas of VerDate 27-JAN-2000 00:32 Feb January 31, 2000 the States, implemented them into the Federal program, and it worked. So,yes, you can take credit for it but youdidn't do it. You vetoed the bills, youkept vetoing the bills, and on the veryday that you signed them, you said wewill be back to change them becausewe don't like this. But, of course, it was an election year. You knew you had to sign it, andyou took credit for it while at the sametime you were criticizing it. I amsorry, Mr. President; I happen to readhistory and I happen to remember whatyou said. Shame on me. On the environment, the President said: . . . one of the things I am grateful for is the opportunity that the Vice President andI have had to finally put to rest the bogusidea that you cannot grow the economy andthe environment at the same time. He said: . . . we have rid more than 500 neighbor- hoods of toxic waste, ensured cleaner air andwater for millions of people. In the past 3months alone, we have preserved over 40 mil-lion roadless acres in the national forests.. . .'' Mr. President, here is the rest of the truth. Those 500 neighborhoods youclaim are a product of the Superfundlaws that were passed long before yougot here. Also, you are taking creditfor cleaner air and water. Congresspassed the Clean Air Act and Congresspassed the Clean Water Act under Re-publican direction, and subsequentlyamendments to change that in a waythat would make it more operative\u00d0and it has worked. But you are the onewho ruined regulation, through ozoneand particulate matter rules, for exam-ple, that have tried to pull it down andmake it less operative. Mr. President, why don't we both take credit for the environment: pastCongresses, current Congress, past ad-ministrations, current administration.We have worked together and our envi-ronment is cleaner, and we are proud ofthat. In 1995, President Clinton said bal- ancing the budget was a bad idea. Letme repeat that. In 1995, Mr. President,you said balancing the budget was abad idea, it was bad for the economy. Going into 1996 and faced with poll data that indicated the American peo-ple were demanding a balanced budget,you decided to surrender on principleand argue about the details later. Thesize of our economic boom today is be-cause Bill Clinton reluctantly wentalong with the core principles thatswept Republicans into control of theCongress in 1994. That balanced budgetdid not happen until there was a Re-publican Congress shaping it and, Mr.President, you know it. Social Securitytaxes today are being locked up andprotected to secure Social Securityand, Mr. President, that was not youridea. In fact, you wanted to spend a bigchunk of that money last year, and wesimply would not let you do it. President Clinton's greatest success story\u00d0the continued economic boom\u00d0is a direct result of the Republican fis- cal policies enacted over the consistentobjections of the President and hisDemocratic colleagues in the Congress.No, we will stand toe to toe on that de-bate. You cannot hide from your rhet-oric and your actions of the past.Those were your policies before theAmerican people said: We have gonetoo far; let's bring our Governmentunder control. President Clinton is a President who claims he wants to protect Social Se-curity, but in 8 years, he has failed tosubmit a serious Social Security pro-tection plan. And President Clinton isa President who claims he wants toprotect Medicare, and yet, last year\u00d0we all know it\u00d0he whispered in theears of those he put on that conferenceand said: Don't vote for it. That was abipartisan proposal, and that is theway reform of Medicare must come. Why didn't he want them to support it and to get it all wrapped up and fin-ished in an election year? Because onecould go out and point fingers and po-liticize Medicare and prescriptiondrugs. Shame on you, Mr. President.Come back and work with us on that.Let's reinstitute the bipartisan agree-ment on which Democrats and Repub-licans stood. We will vote for it andyou ought to sign it, Mr. President.And if you do, that could be your leg-acy. On that I would give you somecredit. We have reinvented Government, trans- forming it into a catalyst for new ideas. . . .With the smallest Federal workforce in 40years, we turned record deficits into recordsurpluses. . . . I was quoting the President. Our record surpluses have little to do withthe size of the Federal workforce.Record surpluses were created by hard-working Americans earning money andpaying taxes and a highly productiveeconomy. That is what has producedthe surpluses, Mr. President, and italso produced record high taxes. Another area on which I want to comment is foster care. It was fas-cinating to me and frustrating whenthe President talked about foster care.I know how that happened. I know Re-publicans and Democrats have theirdifferences. We came together and weworked on it in Congress. It was not inthe White House nor was it the Presi-dent's idea. But because it was a strongbipartisan effort here, we happened topass it. Democrats and Republicans atthe congressional level did that, andthe President has ridden on it eversince. Why? Because it worked, becausechildren are less in foster care today,and we are finding them permanent,loving homes. No longer is the bureauc-racy harboring them. Foster care is agood institution, but it is an institu-tion that was reshaped. Mr. President, because you signed the bill, I am willing to give you somecredit for it, but that is all you did andthat is all you deserve. Then, of course, there is that issue of guns. Last June, the President said: Iwill not send up a licensure bill on guns because the Congress won't passit. Even on less controlling issues, a Democratic vote in the House killedgun control ideas of this administra-tion. So why did the President do itthis time? For Bill and A L; that is Bill Bradley, of course, and A LGORE. They are out on the stump talking about it.His party failed to make guns a na-tional issue, and the reason they failedis because the American people knowthere are over 40,000 gun control lawson the books today, and the Americanpeople have grown wise. If you do notenforce the laws, the criminal elementstill runs rampant and commits crimeswith guns. The American people are not asking for more gun control laws. They areasking for a Justice Department thatwill prosecute those who violate thelaw. Mr. President, that is the messageand, of course, that is what we will doas a Congress. We are not going tostack up more gun laws; we are goingto cause the Justice Department to en-force them. There are myriad other points of dis- cussion, but I wanted the public andthe record to show there is a very realdifference between what this Presidentsaid in his State of the Union Addressand what actually happened and whatis happening because we do not standwith this President on a variety of hisideas, and Congress and the public havelargely rejected them. Republicans will not stand for a Gov- ernment-run health care system. Wewill pass a Patients' Bill of Rights thisyear. We will allow citizens to be incontrol of their health care and theirhealth care delivery, and we will en-hance education this year. We will sendit back to the States and local commu-nities to control. We will save SocialSecurity, as the Senator from Wyo-ming said, and I hope we can deal withMedicare. Mr. President, what is important is that if you want to work with us to re-solve these problems in the final hoursof your administration, then let us sitdown and begin to talk because thehour is late, and I believe you have al-ready written your legacy. I do notthink there are enough Federal dollarsfor you to buy a new one. The Amer-ican people are going to remember BillClinton not for his big governmentideas and his big spending but forsomething entirely different. Let us begin our work in this Con- gress in the last session of the 106thCongress to balance the budget and tosecure Social Security. I hope we candeal with a Patients' Bill of Rights. Iwould like to see us deal with pharma-ceutical drugs for our elderly. I hopewe can also deal with our farm crisisand assure a strong military. I am not going to promise we can do all that Bill wants done and give taxcuts and buy down the debt because wecannot do all those things. Most impor-tant, we should not. I hope we can give VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:37 Feb January 31, 2000 a tax cut. We are buying down the debt. Most importantly, I say to theAmerican people: We are not going toallow Government to grow in theimage of Bill Clinton just for a legacyhe would like to establish. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for the liberty he has allowed me in theuse of time, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wyoming. Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Idaho. Certainly, weshare all those thoughts and ideas. Iwant to expand in the few minutes wehave remaining in our allotment oftime the public land issue the Senatormentioned. Public lands, of course, are very im- portant to those of us in the West. Aswas pointed out, 1 out of every 4 acresin this country is owned by the public.My State of Wyoming is 50-percentowned by the Federal Government.Idaho is some 63-percent owned by theFederal Government. Nevada is 83-per-cent owned by the Federal Govern-ment. The management of these landsthen, rightfully, is a public issue andone with which all of us need to be con-cerned. It would not be a surprise to know that some of the issues with regard tothe management of those lands areseen differently by the people who livethere and who have access to the landsas opposed to those who equally ownthem and live many miles away. Thefact is it is a public issue and it de-serves public input. There is a system that has been set up by the Congress and happens to befollowed by everyone, except the ad-ministration, which allows for publicinput. It requires that all ideas be setforth so that they can be consideredand there can be statements made onall these issues. Sometimes it takes anexcruciatingly long time to do it, butnevertheless it is a vital concept. Now, of course, we have a different thing going on in the administration.They call it a land legacy, an effort bythe President in these remainingmonths to leave a Teddy Rooseveltland legacy for himself and his admin-istration. In so doing, he has done anumber of things quite different fromwhat we have seen done before and,quite frankly, has created a good dealof controversy, particularly in theWest. There are different kinds of lands, of course, set out for different purposes. Ihappen to be chairman of the ParksSubcommittee, so I am very interestedin that. I grew up right outside of Yel-lowstone National Park. As you know,Wyoming has several famous nationalparks. We are very proud of them.Those lands were set aside for a par-ticular purpose. They were set aside be-cause they were unique and they weredifferent. They are used for a limitednumber of purposes. We have the forest reserve which, by its nature, was set aside, was reservedfor special uses. Although there aremany, part of them are wilderness areas set aside by the Congress in spe-cific acts that limit the use, and prop-erly so, in my view. Then there is the Bureau of Land Management, which has a very largesection of lands. Those lands, ratherthan having been set aside for someparticular purpose, were generallywhat was left after the Homestead Actwas completed. They were sort of resid-ual lands that were managed, first ofall, by a different agency but now bythe Bureau of Land Management\u00d0clearly multiple use lands. They areused for many things. These are the kinds of things we have. We have seen suddenly a rush fordoing something in public lands. Thesystem being used now by the adminis-tration completely ignores the Con-gress, which should have a say in thesekinds of things, and as a matter of factgenerally ignores people. One of themis the 40 million acres of roadless areasnationwide that were declared by theForest Service. Frankly, I have no particular quarrel with the idea of taking a look atroadless areas in the forests, but eachforest has a very extensive, very expen-sive, very important forest plan, aprocess that has been gone throughthat requires studies, that requiresproposed regulation, that requiresstatements, that requires hearings.That is where those things ought to bedone rather than having one EIS overthe whole Nation, not for the Secretaryof Agriculture to just come out and de-clare that there are going to be 40 mil-lion acres, and not even knowing ex-actly where they are. As a matter of fact, we had a hearing with the Secretary and with the Chiefof the Forest Service in which theycould tell us very little about it. Another is the $1 billion from off- shore oil royalties that the administra-tion has asked to be given to it tospend, without the approval of Con-gress, to acquire additional lands. As the Senator from Idaho said, in the Western States the acquisition ofnew lands is not the issue. The care ofthose lands, the investment in parks,the investment in forests is where weought to be, in my view. The Antiquities Act, which is a le- gitimate act, has been on the bookssince 1905. Teddy Roosevelt put itthere. As a matter of fact, DevilsTower, in my State, was put in by theAntiquities Act and was part of TetonNational Park. But times havechanged, and we understand now thePresident is going to have 18 differentland areas changed in their designationwithout, really, any hearings\u00d0we hadone last year in Utah that the Gov-ernor and the congressional delegationdid not even know about until it wasdone. That is not the way to do thesekinds of things. They have a proposal to change the way the Land and Water ConservationFund is allocated. It was set up by Con-gress to go half and half\u00d0State and na-tional. Now the administration wants to spend all that money for land acqui-sition. BLM now has a nationwide roadless plan in which there is very little, ifany, input. They have the Clean WaterAction Plan, which is something doneby EPA, which has to do with the con-trol of water, which is really a way ofcontrolling land. Each of these things probably has some merit, but they ought to be ex-amined. They ought to go through thesystem. They ought to be talked about.They ought to be agreed to, ratherthan imposed unilaterally by an ad-ministration. We can preserve public lands, and, in- deed, we should: they are a legacy forus. We can have multiple use on thoselands. We need them for the commu-nities. We can have public involve-ment. That is the way it ought to be.We can have cooperating agency agree-ments in which the State and the localcommunities ought to have a real voicein doing this. I hope we do not politicize public lands simply because it is an electionyear, to the distraction of public use,to the distraction of the economiesthat surround them. The purpose ofpublic lands is to preserve the re-sources and give a chance for the own-ers to enjoy it. The owners, of course,are the taxpayers. It is an issue on which I think we will have more and more input throughoutthe year. I hope we do. Mr. President, our time is nearly ex- pired. I yield the floor and suggest theabsence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. T HOMAS ). Without objection, it is so or- dered. Mr. GRASSLEY. I think we are in morning business, right? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. THE PENTAGON'S ACTING INSPECTOR GENERAL Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment with mycolleagues to discuss a recent articlethat was in the National Journal. Itwas about the Pentagon's Acting In-spector General, Mr. Donald Mancuso.The article was written by Mr. GeorgeWilson. Mr. Wilson was a senior defensereporter at the Washington Post formany years. He left the WashingtonPost in 1991 to write books. He is nowa columnist with the National Journal. Mr. Wilson is a top-notch reporter. He is respected for being very thoroughand very fair. But, above all, he is re-spected for an uncanny ability to findthe nub of a complex issue and exposeit to public scrutiny in an interesting VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 January 31, 2000 and also informative way. He had a re- cent article in the National Journalthat is no exception. It has exposed avery raw nerve. The article is entitled:``Tailhook May Soil Choice for Penta-gon's Mr. Clean.'' It appeared in theJanuary 22, 2000, issue of the NationalJournal on pages 260 and 261. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to have that article printed in theR ECORD at the end of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See Exhibit 1.)Mr. GRASSLEY. The article I refer to raises important questions, evennew questions, about Mr. Mancuso's in-tegrity and judgment. At some pointdown the road, this body may be calledupon to confirm or not confirm Mr.Mancuso's nomination because it hasbeen suggested that President Clintonis expected to nominate him to be thenext Department of Defense InspectorGeneral. If that happens, then each Member of this body would need to weigh all thefacts bearing on Mr. Mancuso's fitnessto serve as the Pentagon's watchdog,which is also the Pentagon's top cop. In October, my staff on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Over-sight and the Courts issued, for me, areport on the Defense Criminal Inves-tigative Service. I am going to refer tothat, as it is always referred to, as theDCIS\u00d0Defense Criminal InvestigativeService. I strongly urge my colleagues to read this report. It substantiated allega-tions of misconduct on the part of sen-ior DCIS management, including Mr.Mancuso, and at least one of his inves-tigators, Mr. Mathew Walinsky. Mr.Mancuso at that time was Director ofDCIS, and he was so from 1988 until1997. Since that report was issued in Octo- ber, my staff has been inundated withnew complaints about alleged mis-conduct by Mr. Mancuso and mis-management at DCIS while Mr.Mancuso was the Director of DCIS. Mystaff is now in the process of evalu-ating these allegations to determine ifthey have merit. Once that review hasbeen conducted, I may issue a secondreport. Getting back to Mr. Wilson's article in the National Journal, by compari-son, instead of my report opening up anew can of worms, Mr. Wilson's articlehas opened an old can of worms\u00d0inthis case, Navy worms. It explores Mr.Mancuso's role in the investigation ofmisconduct at the infamous Tailhookconvention in September 1991. By re-opening this very unfortunate episodein naval history, Mr. Wilson has shednew light on Mr. Mancuso's fitness tomove into the inspector general's slot. Mr. Wilson reports that the U.S. Court of Military Appeals condemnedMr. Mancuso and the DCIS for, in theirwords, ``heavy-handed investigativetactics that trampled constitutionalrights.'' According to Mr. Wilson, Mr.Mancuso's tactics included ``threats,intimidation, falsification of inter- views, and overreliance on lie detec-tors.'' In an opinion issued on January 11, 1994, on the Tailhook case, the U.S.Court of Military Appeals denouncedMr. Mancuso's tactics. The court com-pared the Tailhook case review process,which was set up by Mr. Mancuso, tosort of an assembly line justice, whereinvestigative and judicial functionswere merged and blurred. ``Merged''and ``blurred'' are words the courtused. ``Assembly line'' are words thecourt used. The court called Mr.Mancuso's assembly line justice ``trou-blesome.'' Going on to quote the court: At best, it reflects a most curiously care- less and amateurish approach to a very highprofile case by experienced military lawyersand investigators. At worst, it raises the pos-sibility of a shadiness in respecting therights of military members caught up in acriminal investigation that cannot be con-doned. That is what the U.S. Court of Mili- tary Appeals had to say. That is thehighest military court in our land. It isoften called the United States Court ofAppeals of the Armed Forces. So thishighest court has condemned Mr.Mancuso for ``shadiness.'' The courtsaid his practices were ``careless andamateurish'' and even ``troublesome.''The court said he and his investigatorsfailed to respect the constitutional rights of members of the armed serv-ices. I hope the Chair will agree that these are very serious charges about a personwhom the President may nominate forour confirmation as inspector generalof the Department of Defense. Thecourt's criticism\u00d0again referring tothe Court of Military Appeals\u00d0mayhelp to explain why the Tailhook in-vestigation was a total failure. The en-tire investigation probably cost thetaxpayers close to $10 million and in-volved several thousand interviews.Unfortunately, not one single navalaviator who faced an assault chargewas ever convicted by a court-martial. As the Director of DCIS, Mr. Mancuso led the Tailhook investiga-tion. He is accountable for failing toconduct it as a professional. A legiti-mate question for my colleagues andfor the President: Should that sameman, a man who used shady investiga-tive tactics, a man who failed to re-spect naval judicial process inTailhook, be confirmed as the Penta-gon's watchdog? It is legitimate to askif Mr. Mancuso is the best person to fillthat position. I leave those thoughts with my col- leagues over the next several weeks asthis nomination may come up for con-sideration. I yield the floor. EXHIBIT NO. 1 [From the National Journal, January 22, 2000] TAILHOOK MAYSOILCHOICE FOR PENTAGON 'S MR. CLEAN (By George C. Wilson) The man President Clinton is expected to nominate as inspector general of the DefenseDepartment\u00d0the Pentagon's top cop\u00d0is coming under increased scrutiny in the Sen-ate for questionable official conduct. Ques-tions surround his role in the Tailhook sex- ual assault investigation of the early 1990sand his handling of his own investigators,one of whom pleaded guilty to stealing a 13-year-old boy's identity to obtain a false pass-port. Donald Mancuso, the Pentagon's acting in- spector general and probable nominee for thepermanent job, formerly led the DefenseCriminal Investigative Service. DCIS, whichconducts most of the fraud and misconductinvestigations at the Defense Department,had taken over the Tailhook investigation in1992 after the Navy was accused of botchingit. During the Tailhook investigation, naval aviators accused Mancuso's agents of heavy-handed tactics that trampled their constitu-tional rights. These tactics, they main-tained, included threats, intimidation, fal-sification of interviews, and overreliance onlie detectors. In the end, no aviator was con-victed at court-martial for misconduct atthe Tailhook convention, which was held inSeptember 1991 at the Las Vegas Hilton. The U.S. Court of Military Appeals, in its review of the Tailhook cases, criticized mili-tary lawyers and the IG's investigators\u00d0whowere supervised by Mancuso\u00d0for proceduresthat were ``troublesome.'' The court faultedinvestigators for an approach that was ``curi-ously careless and amateurish,'' and thatdidn't sufficiently respect the rights of sus-pects. Several lawyers who defended Tailhook aviators told National Journal that theystand ready to cite examples of misconductby DCIS agents if the Mancuso nominationmoves forward. Their testimony could widenand escalate a battle over Mancuso that Sen.Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, began at the endof the past congressional session. WhiteHouse attorneys had focused on Grassley'searlier objections, but they apparently hadnot looked into Mancuso's Tailhook rolewhen they told National Journal recentlythat they saw no reason to recommend henot be nominated. Grassley up to now had focused his objec- tions on Mancuso's supposedly poor judg-ment while director of the Defense CriminalInvestigative Service from 1988\u00b197. Grassleyaccused Mancuso of coddling a deputy afterthe deputy confessed to stealing a dead boy'sidentity in an effort to get a false passportfor still-mysterious reasons. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has mounted a stout defense of Mancuso and hastold Grassley that none of the Senator's ob-jections should bar him from advancement.However, the Tailhook connection, whichGrassley's investigators have just begun toprobe, may turn the Mancuso nominationinto a ``bolter''\u00d0pilot talk for an airplanethat misses the arresting wires stretchedacross an aircraft-carrier deck and so fails toland. Grassley will do his best to exploit theTailhook connection in hearings and on theSenate floor. Former Navy Secretary JohnW. Warner, R-Va., chairman of the SenateArmed Services Committee, which wouldhold confirmation hearings on a Mancusonomination, is likely to plead with the Presi-dent not to nominate anybody who wouldpull Congress back into the Tailhook swamp. The U.S. Court of Military Appeals de- nounced the tactics of Mancuso's agents inan opinion issued on Jan. 11, 1994, on aTailhook case against Navy Lt. David Sam-ples. The defendant had been charged withparticipating in the ``gantlet'' in whichdrunken pilots groped, and in some cases as-saulted, dozens of women who ventured downthe third-floor hallway at the Hilton. Sam-ples charged that he endured his own inten-sive gantlet of interrogations as one naval VerDate 27-JAN-2000 January 31, 2000 officer after another advised him to tell what he knew and, in his view, guaranteed himcomplete immunity if he did. After under-going the Navy interviews, he was imme-diately interrogated by DCIS in assemblyline fashion. In court testimony, Special Agent Mat- thew A. Walinsky of DCIS attributed the as-sembly line idea to DCIS Director Mancuso:``We felt that, or the director [of the] DCISfelt that, it was one of the ways that wecould have a resolution in the case and befair to everybody that was involved in [the]case, so that they would have a walk-away''from any further entanglement in theTailhook mess. The U.S. Court of Military Appeals as- sailed the arrangement: ``The assembly linetechnique in this case that merged andblurred investigative and justice proceduresis troublesome. At best, it reflects a most cu-riously careless and amateurish approach toa very high profile case by experienced mili-tary lawyers and investigators. At worst, itraises the possibility of a shadiness in re-specting the rights of military memberscaught up in a criminal investigation thatcannot be condoned.'' Mancuso, when asked by National Journal to respond to the court's denunciation, said:``The quote [from the decision] was takenout of context and exhibits a lack of under-standing of the technique being discussed.. . . DCIS played a minor role in the `assem-bly line technique' as described in the opin-ion. The DCIS investigation of the Tailhookmatter was handled thoroughly and profes-sionally.'' But Charles W. Gittins of Middletown, Va., a defense attorney in the Tailhook case,charged in an interview with National Jour-nal that Mancuso's DCIS agents ``routinelyviolated naval officers' rights ofretribution for failure to cooperate,'' Gittinssaid that Mancuso's supervision of his inves-tigators ``left much to be desired. I wouldhave concern if Mancuso became IG abouthis integrity and commitment to the rule oflaw.'' He added he would welcome the chanceto give such testimony to Congress. Robert B. Rae of Virginia Beach, Va., an- other Tailhook defense attorney and aformer U.S. attorney, said that Mancuso``abused his position [as DCIS director] andshowed a general justice'' during the Tailhook investiga-tion. ``He intentionally failed to comply withthe judge's order to produce evidence anddocuments on several occasions. We needsomebody [as inspector general] who makesthe ethical decision, not the politically cor-rect one. He [Mancuso] was politically moti-vated.'' Mancuso told National Journal that ``while I don't remember being directly involvedwith either of these defense counsels duringthe Tailhook investigation, it is not unusualfor defense counsels to disagree with the gov-ernment's investigation techniques. I cat-egorically deny that I have ever inten-tionally failed to comply with any judge'sorder.'' He said that as DCIS director, heworked to ensure that both sides received allrequested information promptly. As Pentagon inspector general, Mancuso would be responsible for supervising 1,228employees, including 323 criminal investiga-tors, and for overseeing a budget of $136.8million annually. He would be paid a salaryof $118,400 a year. Grassley is particularly vexed about what Mancuso did\u00d0and did not do\u00d0about LarryJoe Hollingsworth, a deputy at DCIS whowas responsible for keeping agents in line,but who committed a felony that a hearingjudge termed ``bizarre.'' In 1992, Hollings-worth found in the records of a Florida li-brary the obituary of Charles W. Drew, whodied at age 13. Hollingsworth decided to as- sume the boy's identity. And by posing asthe deceased boy's half brother, Hollings-worth obtained the identification papers heneeded to apply for a passport in Charles'name. He appended pictures of himself to thepassport application and signed it in such amuddled way that the State Department in-vestigated, leading to Hollingsworth's arrest,indictment, and confession to one count offraud. Why would a 46-year-old, $92,926-a-year Pentagon executive with more than 20 years'experience investigating other people'scrimes commit one himself? ``In the last fewyears,'' Hollingsworth wrote right after hisarrest, ``I have seen repeated news storiesabout how easy it would be'' to assumesomeone else's identity. ``I decided to see ifit was true. This was a Walter Mitty fantasy,however, for excitement and not to hurt any-one.'' Special Agent Sean O'Brien of the State Department told investigators with Grass-ley's Senate Judiciary Administrative Over-sight and the Courts Subcommittee that``there were at least 12 overt acts of fraudperpetrated by Mr. Hollingsworth over thecourse of one year.'' O'Brien told the inves-tigators that ``passport fraud is always com-mitted in furtherance of a more seriouscrime . . .'' On April 29, 1996, Mancuso wrote, on assist- ant inspector general stationery, to federalJudge T.S. Ellis III of the U.S. District Courtin Alexandria, VA., while the jurist wasweighing what penalty to impose on Hol-lingsworth. ``To this day,'' he wrote, ``thereis no evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth hasever done anything improper relating to hisduties and responsibilities as a DCIS agentand manager. . . . It is our intention to con-sider removal action against him after theconclusion of the criminal charges. . . . Iwould ask that you also consider the sever-ity of these administrative actions as youpronounce sentencing.'' Grassley accused Mancuso of showing poor judgment in writing what the Senator con-sidered a plea for leniency. Grassley alsocriticized Mancuso for letting Hollingsworthretire at 50 in 1996 with full pay, 12 yearsahead of schedule\u00d0a decision that cost thetaxpayers an extra $750,000, Grassley said. Mancuso denied asking for leniency. He told National Journal that that ``my intentin writing the letter was to advise the judgeof SA [Special Agent] Hollingsworth's pastjob performance while assigned to DCIS, notto ask for leniency. In fact, nowhere in myletter is the term `leniency' used.'' Hollingsworth, after pleading guilty, was sentenced in June 1996 to supervised proba-tion for two years and was fined $5,000, plus$195.30 a month to pay for the cost of super-vising him while on probation. He also hadto serve 30 days of jail time on weekends,perform 200 hours of community service, andpay a $50 special assessment. The majority staff of Grassley's sub- committee on Nov. 2 filed a 64-page reporthighly critical of Mancuso's conduct. Cohenresponded to Grassley on Dec. 28 that hisstaff had found nothing in the subcommit-tee's report to shake his ``complete con-fidence in Mr. Mancuso's abilities and integ-rity. Nothing I have seen has caused me todoubt Mr. Mancuso's ability to ably, fairly,and honestly lead the Office of the InspectorGeneral.'' ``Bill,'' Grassley wrote back to Cohen on Jan. 7, ``you and I have known each other formany years, I know, if given an accurate re-port on the facts in the case, you would notdefend the integrity of the acting IG.'' Since vote-counters have apparently con- cluded that Grassley does not have enoughSenate allies to defeat the nomination, theWhite House intends to nominate Mancuso when Congress reconvenes. Will the stubbornIowan resort to a filibuster, or will he placea simple hold on the nomination, in light ofTailhook and other charges? ``I don't knowyet,'' Grassley replied. Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed tospeak as if in morning business for 15minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR MEDICARE Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few moments todayabout the call in the State of the UnionAddress for a prescription drug benefitto be added to the Medicare program. In all of the discussions about the State of the Union and what is hap-pening to the health of the Americanpeople, one of the underlying issues isthat people are living longer and betterlives. When people live longer and bet-ter lives, it means we have more strainon Medicare and on Social Security.But, of course, all of that is born ofgood news: People are living longer. Atthe start of the last century, citizens ofthe United States were expected tolive, on average, to about 48 years ofage. One hundred years later, in theyear 2000, you are expected to live to beabout 78 years of age\u00d0a 30-year in-crease in life expectancy. That is reallyquite remarkable. What are the reasons for that? There are a lot of reasons: Better nutrition,new medical technologies, and life-sav-ing prescription medicines that havebeen developed to extend life. Thereare a lot of reasons for the increasedlongevity. In 1965, we created a Medicare pro- gram that has contributed substan-tially to the increase in longevity inthis country. Prior to that time, 50 per-cent of senior citizens had no healthcare coverage at all\u00d0none. Medicareprovided health care coverage to allsenior citizens, and now 99 percent ofolder Americans in this country havebasic health care protection throughMedicare. That clearly has extendedlife and has allowed people to livelonger and better lives. But in 1965when Medicare was created, many ofthe prescription drugs that now existfor extending life simply weren't avail-able. There was not, therefore, a needfor a prescription drug benefit in Medi-care. The call now by the President and by Members of Congress, myself included, VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 Feb January 31, 2000 Democrats and Republicans alike, is for a prescription drug benefit for theMedicare program. Why? Because sen-ior citizens in this country comprise 12percent of our population and consume33 percent of the prescription drugs inour country. Let me repeat that because it is im- portant. Twelve percent of our population are senior citizens, but yet they consumeone-third of the prescription drugs. The cost of prescription drugs last year increased nearly 16 percent\u00d0lastyear alone. Part of the reason for thatincrease was price inflation, and partof it was a dramatic increase in utiliza-tion. But we should, it seems to me, beespecially concerned about senior citi-zens having access to the prescriptiondrugs they need to extend and improvetheir lives. As chairman of the Democratic Pol- icy Committee, I have been holdinghearings in various parts of the coun-try on this very subject. For instance,I held a hearing with Senator S CHUMER in Westchester, NY, and a hearing re-cently with Senator D URBIN in Chicago. I guess I have held perhaps six or eighthearings on this subject. It is heartbreaking sometimes to hear the stories told at these hearings.An oncologist came to a hearing I held.He told of one of his patients who wasa senior citizen, a woman who hadbreast cancer. And he said: There is amedicine she needs to take followingher surgery, chemotherapy, and radi-ation that will reduce the chances thatshe will have a recurrence of breastcancer. When I described this medicineto her, she said: What does it cost? Thedoctor told her what it cost. And shesaid: There isn't any way I can affordthat medicine. I will just have to takemy chances. I will just have to take mychances of the breast cancer recurringbecause I can't afford the medicine. It breaks your heart to hear that.Or to hear a senior citizen who said: When I go into the grocery store whereI purchase my medications, the firststop for me must be the pharmacycounter because I must get my pre-scriptions filled, so then I will knowhow much money I have left for food.Only then will I know how much food Ican buy. Senior citizens will find in some cir- cumstances that they take 4, 6, or 8,and in some cases 10 and 12, differentkinds of medicines at the same time.Some of them are horribly expensive.Yet most older Americans have verylittle prescription drug coverage. I would like to show some charts that describe these circumstancesgraphically, especially for senior citi-zens. This chart shows that nearly a third of senior citizens spend $1,500 a year onprescription drugs. These are peoplewho are living on fixed incomes, and 70percent of them have incomes of $15,000or less. This chart shows that nearly 75 per- cent of Medicare beneficiaries have in-adequate prescription drug coverage. In fact, 34 percent have no drug coverageat all\u00d0none, zero. So they must go tothe drugstore to buy their prescriptiondrugs, living on a fixed income, tryingto balance the need to pay heat andlight and rent and food, and then try tofigure out how to pay for increasinglyexpensive prescription drugs. Many ofthem find they can't do it. They tell me at these hearings some of the measures they are forced totake: I have heart trouble, or I have di-abetes, they tell me, and what I do isbuy the prescription drugs that thedoctor says I must have, and cut thepills in half and take half the dose so itlasts twice as long. And they hopesomehow that they will avoid medicalproblems by doing it. It breaks yourheart to hear someone 85 years of agewho knows he has to take medicine todeal with his heart disease and diabe-tes, but who says: I can't afford it so Idon't take the medicine. As this chart shows, this is especially a problem for older women. As you cansee, the majority of women have noprescription drug coverage at all. Thatis a very serious problem. This chart illustrates that rural beneficiaries are less likely to haveprescription drug coverage across allincome groups. I represent a ruralState and the many hearings I haveheld in North Dakota confirm this fact. We are going to be confronted in this Congress with the question of whetherwe should add a prescription drug ben-efit to the Medicare program. When Iwas in New York with Senator S CHU- MER, Connie Pennucci, 77 years old, said she has no prescription drug bene-fits and pays $200 a month out of pock-et for the medications she needs totreat her arthritis and osteoporosis. In Illinois about 2 weeks ago, a woman named Anita Milton told Sen-ator D URBIN and I that she had a dou- ble lung transplant. Because of the wayMedicaid works, she gets help to payfor her prescription drugs one month,but then the next month she has nodrug benefits at all. I think she told usthat her prescription drugs to preventthe rejection of her new lungs cost$2,500 a month. Think of that, $2,500 amonth. At that same hearing, this wonderful woman who had a double lung trans-plant was joined by two people who hadheart transplants. They told us thecost of their prescription drugs thatare necessary to prevent rejection oftheir transplanted hearts. Is all of thismiracle medicine? Of course it is. Butit is only miraculous if you can affordthe prescription drugs that must betaken on a daily basis to ward off therejection of the transplanted organ. There is an urgent requirement, in my judgment, for all of us in Congressto join together to find a way to add aprescription drug benefit to Medicare.We should do it in a way that is vol-untary for senior citizens. We shoulddo it in a way that doesn't break theTreasury, and pharmaceutical pricesshould be affordable. But we can do that. I hope Republicans and Demo-crats together will recognize the ur-gent need to do this. I would like to address one other issue, and that is the issue of the priceof prescription drugs. Why do prescrip-tion drugs cost so much, and what canwe do about it? Let me say at the out-set, I want the pharmaceutical indus-try to be successful. I want the drugcompanies to be successful. I wantthem to be profitable. I want them tocontinue to invest in new research anddevelopment to help discover new life-saving medicines and drugs. As youknow, the federal government providesa substantial investment in pharma-ceutical research and developmentthrough the National Institutes ofHealth and tax credits. A substantialamount of research and developmentfor new medicines is publicly funded.But the pharmaceutical industry doesprivate research and development. I want them to be successful. But I also want them to price pharma-ceutical drugs fairly for all of theAmerican people. In virtually everyother country in which you purchase aprescription drug made by a pharma-ceutical company in a plant inspectedby the Food and Drug Administration,the same pill in the same bottle madeby the same company costs double,sometimes triple the amount in theUnited States than in virtually anyother country in the world. I will giveyou some examples. Let me go back to some of the medi- cations most frequently used by olderAmericans who consume a third of theprescription drugs in our country. Ifthey take Zocor, a cholesterol-reducingdrug, the same drug in the same dosageand quantity costs $106 in the UnitedStates, and only $43 in Canada, $47 inMexico. These prices have been con-verted to U.S. dollars. Or Prilosec, a drug for ulcers costs $105 in the U.S., $53 in Canada, and $29in Mexico. Zoloft, a drug for depression, costs $195 in America, $124 in Canada, and$155 in Mexico. The list goes on. This chart shows it better. How much do we pay for prescription drugs? Forevery $1 that American consumers payfor a prescription drug, that same drugwould cost much less in other nations.For every dollar Americans spend forprescription medications, Canadianconsumers pay 64 cents, the Englishpay 65 cents, the Swedes pay $68 cents,and the Italians pay 51 cents. Why do U.S. consumers pay the high- est prices in the world for prescriptiondrugs? The answer is because the phar-maceutical industry can charge asmuch as they want if they choose to doso \u00d0and they do. I took a small group of senior citi- zens to Emerson, Canada, recently.They purchased prescription drugs atthe pharmacy in Emerson. These aresenior citizens with heart disease,osteoporosis, diabetes, and other ill-nesses. Guess what. We went 5 miles VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 January 31, 2000 across the border into Canada and there they could buy the same pre-scription drugs at a small percentageof the price of the prescription drugs inthis country. These are the same pills,made by the same company, often ac-tually made in the United States andthen shipped 5 miles north into Can-ada. Yet, if U.S. consumers were to buythem in the United States, they arecharged much higher prices. Is that fair? No. If this is truly a global economy, then it seems to methat pharmacists in this country oughtto be able to access those same drugsin any market in the world and passthe savings on to their customers. Thatwould, in my judgment, force the phar-maceutical industry to reprice theirproducts in the United States. As I said when I started, I want the pharmaceutical industry to makemoney. I want them to do good phar-maceutical. The Wall Street Journalcalls the profits of the pharmaceuticalindustry ``the envy of the corporateworld.'' Why? At least in part, it seemsto me, it is because the U.S. consumeris charged very, very high prices forthe same drug that is marketed in therest of the world at a much lower cost.I have introduced a piece of legislation,the International Prescription DrugParity Act, that I and a bipartisangroup of cosponsors are going to try toget passed in this Congress to addressthis problem. These issues of pharmaceutical drug costs and a prescription drug benefit inMedicare are very important issues.Lifesaving medicine is only able tosave lives if people can afford to haveaccess to that medicine. Too manyAmericans find these prices are out oftheir reach. Too many senior citizensliving on fixed incomes are findingthey are not able to afford the medi-cines that are necessary for them toprolong their lives, to improve theirlives, and to treat their diseases or ill-ness. We in Congress can do somethingabout that. But I would say this. Evenas we try to add a prescription drugbenefit to Medicare, we must find away to put some downward pressure onprescription drug prices and providesome fairness relative to what the restof the world pays for the same prescrip- tion drugs. Mr. President, I again thank the Sen- ator from Iowa for the courtesy. Iknow the bankruptcy bill is on thefloor. I yield the floor.Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, par- liamentary inquiry: Are we still inmorning business? EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be appropriate to extend morning busi-ness. Under the order we are to go to S.625. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speakfor up to 15 minutes as in morningbusiness.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.(The remarks of Mr. S PECTER per- taining to the introduction of S. 2015are located in today's R ECORD under ``Statements on Introduced Bills andJoint Resolutions.'') YONGYI SONG Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a distin-guished Pennsylvanian, the librarianfrom Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA,Mr. who was greeted tu-multuously in Philadelphia on Satur-day afternoon when he returned fromthe People's Republic of China afterhaving been held in custody there sinceAugust 7. Mr. Yongyi Song came to the United States some 10 years ago and has be-come a world-renowned scholar on theCultural Revolution. In addition to hisregular duties at Dickinson College, hehas published extensively on the Cul-tural Revolution. Last August, he and his wife Helen made a trip to the People's Republic ofChina so that he could continue his re-search. While there, he was taken intocustody on August 7. Thereafter, hiswife was released, but on ChristmasEve he was charged with transmittingstate secrets. A careful analysis of the case raises very severe questions as to whetherthere was ever any substance to thecharges. A campaign was waged byscholars and academicians and by col-leges and universities across the landto obtain his release. Dickinson Col-lege retained a very distinguished at-torney, Jerome Cohen, an expert inChinese affairs, who took up the cause. A resolution was submitted last Wednesday by this Senator with quitea number of cosponsors\u00d0SenatorB IDEN, the ranking member on the For- eign Relations Committee, being theprincipal cosponsor; in addition, Sen-ator S ANTORUM and others. After consultation with Secretary of State Albright and others in the StateDepartment, I sought a meeting withthe Chinese Ambassador, which I hadlast Friday late in the morning. Before going to the meeting, I heard rumors that Yongyi Song might be re-leased. While I met with the ChineseAmbassador, I was delighted to findthat he handed me a piece of paper an-nouncing Mr. Song's release, and gaveme the word that Mr. Song would soonbe on a Northwest airliner headed forDetroit, and ultimately for Philadel-phia. We thank the People's Republic of China and we thank the Chinese Am-bassador for Mr. Yongyi Song's release.We regret that he ever was taken intocustody. But when he returned andcommented to the news media, on agalaxy of cameras\u00d0both television andstill cameras\u00d0and to many newspaperreporters, Mr. Song commented that hewas not physically abused. He said hewas subjected to a good bit of mental torture. He disputed the representa-tions by the People's Republic of Chinathat he had confessed or implicatedothers. But as Shakespeare would say, ``All's well that ends well.'' It has been reported that this is the first time there has been a release ofanybody who was charged with stealingstate secrets. It is my hope that this isa significant step forward for the Peo-ple's Republic of China to recognizehuman rights. In an era when the Peo-ple's Republic of China is seeking per-manent most-favored-nation status andseeking entry into the World Trade Or-ganization, it is my hope that they willaccept at least minimal norms for dueprocess, so that if someone is takeninto custody, that person is entitled toconfer with counsel, should be entitledto notice of the charges, should be enti-tled to an open trial, and should havethe requirement that evidence be pre-sented in an open forum before any de-termination of guilt. The detention of Mr. Yongyi Song from August 7 until January 28, in myjudgment, was excessive. But we areglad to have Yongyi Song back at hisduties at Dickinson College and gladthis has ended favorably. We do hopethis is a first step in a continuing rec-ognition by the People's Republic ofChina to give appropriate consider-ation to human rights. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that a copy of the article entitled``Scholar Back in U.S. After China De-tention'' from The New York Times beprinted in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in theR ECORD , as follows: [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2000] SCHOLAR BACK IN U.S. A FTER CHINA DETENTION (By Philip Shenon) PHILADELPHIA , Jan. 29\u00d0An American-based Chinese scholar who had been jailed in Chinafor nearly six months returned to the UnitedStates today to say that he had been ``men-tally tortured'' by Chinese security agentswho demanded that he confess to espionageand implicate others. ``They didn't torture me physically, but I should say that they mentally tortured me,''the scholar, Song Yongyi, a research librar-ian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa.,said after he was reunited with his wife in atearful scene at Philadelphia's internationalairport. ``It was very ruthless.'' ``When I come back to the United States, I really feel at home now,'' said Mr. Song, whowas taken into custody by the Chinese lastsummer, only weeks before he had beenscheduled to be sworn in as an American cit-izen. ``Even though China gave me birth, theUnited States gave me spirit.'' In an airport news conference and in a sep- arate interview, the 50-year-old librarian, aspecialist in the documents of the murderousdecade from 1966 to 1976 known as the Cul-tural Revolution, denied a claim by the Chi-nese government that he was freed after heconfessed to spying. ``I did not confess to anything,'' he said, crediting his release to pressure on Beijingfrom members of Congress who threatened tohold up vital trade legislation, and fromWestern scholars who campaigned for hisfreedom. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 2000 Scholars had warned that his arrest threat- ened to jeopardize academic exchange pro-grams that China had carefully cultivatedwith the United States and other Westerncountries since the late 1970's. ``I say thank you to all the American peo- ple, because without them I cannot get re-leased,'' Mr. Song said, his eyes brimmingwith tears, which he said were among thefirst he had shed since childhood. ``Duringthe past 30 years, I never cry, but last nightI cry all night.'' He was met at the airport by his wife, Helen Yao, a jewelry designer, and SenatorA RLEN SPECTER , the Pennsylvania Repub- lican who introduced legislation demandingMr. Song's release and granting him imme-diate American citizenship. He also threat-ened to block legislation intended to makeway for China's entry into the World TradeOrganization. Mr. Song and his wife, who is also Chinese- born, were detained in August in Beijing,where he had been gathering yellowing Com-munist Party newspapers and handbills pub-lished during the Cultural Revolution, aboutwhich he has written two books and severalarticles. Ms. Yao was released in Novemberand forced to leave China without her hus-band. Mr. Song said today that the documents he had been gathering were published by theradicals known as the Red Guards and thatthey were available at the time to virtuallyeveryone in China. He said there was nothingsecret about them. ``You can purchase all those in public mar- kets,'' he said. ``You can purchase those insome book stores. This is not national secu-rity.'' He said he argued the point with his guards over and over again. ``I strongly argue that,''he said in his sometimes broken English. ``My question is: If you say this is a secretand I'm leaking the secret, then you shouldfirst say all the Chinese people are spies. Be-cause they all touched those. They all knowthis, not only me.'' The Cultural Revolution, in which millions of Chinese were persecuted as Mao tried toconsolidate his power and ``purify'' the Com-munist Party, remains a subject of extremesensitivity to Beijing, which continues to re-strict access to official archives of the pe-riod. During his early interrogations, Mr. Song said, his guards tried to coerce him with lies.He said they told him that his wife, who wasbeing held in a separate detention center,was gravely ill, but that she could be freedfor medical treatment if he confessed to spy-ing. ``That was the worst moment of all,'' he said. ``They say my wife is so sick and soweak, that I should think about my wife andhow she could return home quickly.'' When that did not work, he said, the guards tried to convince him that his wifehad implicated him in spying and othercrimes against the government. ``Every timethey question me, they say, your wife sayssuch-and-such, your wife identifies such-and-such,'' Mr. Song said. At one point, he said, security agents told him that his wife had identified him as amember of Falun Gong, the spiritual groupthat has been the subject of a vicious crack-down recently, and that he had smuggled itsliterature into China. ``I know nothing about Falun Gong,'' Mr. Song said, ``I say, I believe this is not true.I say, bring my wife in. But then they be-come suddenly silent. They said, O.K., wemove on to the next topic.'' He said the experience of the last several months was far worse than his experienceduring the Cultural Revolution, when he wasarrested and branded a counter-revolutionary.``In the 1970's, I was beaten, I was tor- tured,'' he said. ``But this was worse. Withphysical torture, they torture only you. Thistime, they arrest, and they try to mentallytorture my wife. As a man, you feel so bad.'' Mr. Song, who has bladder cancer that is in remission, said that he had repeatedly askedto see a doctor, but that his guards refusedwithout explanation. ``My health conditionis not very good, and I asked them severaltimes if I could get doctors to examine me,but they wouldn't,'' he said ``As soon as I gethome, I should see a doctor and get a fullbody examination.'' As he set off from the airport after the news conference, Mr. Song was asked whathe would do when he arrived home in Car-lisle. He did not hesitate. ``I think he willhave some sweet talk with my wife,'' he said,his arm tightly around her shoulder. He said Ms. Yao's confinement in China had changed her. ``My wife became a verybrave woman, so I'm very proud of her,'' hesaid. ``Actually this is not her typical char-acteristic. The Chinese government, the Chi-nese national security police, they make aweak woman into a brave soldier.'' Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and my distinguished colleague from Iowa. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, Isuggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Without objection, it is so or- dered. BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999\u00d0Resumed Mr. SESSIONS. I believe the pending order of business is the bankruptcybill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to talk about the pending bankruptcy bill andgive my full and total support to thework of Senator G RASSLEY and others. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title, sincethese will be the first comments. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 625) to amend title 11, United States Code, and for other purposes. Pending: Wellstone amendment No. 2537, to disallow claims of certain insured depository institu-tions. Wellstone amendment No. 2538, with re- spect to the disallowance of certain claimsand to prohibit certain coercive debt collec-tion practices. Schumer/Durbin amendment No. 2762, to modify the means test relating to safe har-bor provisions. Schumer amendment No. 2763, to ensure that debts incurred as a result of clinic vio-lence are nondischargeable. Feingold modified amendment No. 2748, to provide for an exception to a limitation onan automatic stay under section 362(b) oftitle 11, United States Code, relating to evic-tions and similar proceedings to provide forthe payment of rent that becomes due afterthe petition of a debtor is filed.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is recognized. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I give my total support to this bill,which is a needed overhaul reform up-date and modernization of an act thatis very important to America. It allowspeople every day\u00d0over a million ayear\u00d0to totally wipe out debts thatthey owe, to start afresh and not paypeople they have legally obligatedthemselves to pay. It is part of our his-torical constitutional process. We ven-erate that right to start anew. Over the past years, we also have rec- ognized there are a number of problemswith the way bankruptcy is being han-dled. We believe we can make it better.I believe this bill does make it better.As a new Senator who has been hereonly 3 years, it has been somewhatfrustrating to see that we cannot quiteget a final vote on the bill. At one timeor another, at the most inopportunemoments, there has been a group ofpeople who have come up with objec-tions and delays, and we have now beenon this for 3 years. It has passed this body with over 90 votes. At one time it came out of theJudiciary Committee with a 16\u00b12 vote.We have a good, broad, bipartisan billthat improves bankruptcy law, and itought to be passed. The objections tothis legislation have only been those ofthe most complex and minute nature.The overall aspects of this bill aresound. It has very little opposition. Let me point out a few things.Bankruptcies have increased 350 per- cent since 1980, during a time of greateconomic expansion. In 1980, there were287,000 bankruptcies filed. In 1999, asthis chart shows, there were 1,300,000bankruptcies filed. And 1999, as thePresident told us the other night, wasa great year for Americans economi-cally. How is this happening? Is this nec- essary? Are these all legitimate? Whatcan we do about it? That is what thisbill addresses. I believe we do need reform because of an extraordinary increase in filings. Some are saying we do not need this bill. There was an ad run in a localWashington newspaper that said: We donot need the bankruptcy legislation;we had a 7 percent drop last year in fil- ings; so, therefore, you should just stopall the work that you have been doing. I thought that was a silly ad. After a 350 percent increase, we have one of thebest economic years ever and had amodest decline of 7 percent, and some-how that suggests we do not have aproblem with filings? We do have aproblem with filings. The numbers stillare well over 1 million filings per year. There is another reason we need bankruptcy reform. I am a lawyer. Iserved as a U.S. attorney. I am on theJudiciary Committee. I believe thatthe rule of law ought to be consistentand fair, worthy of respect. I also rec-ognize that lawyers are strong advo-cates. I respect that. Sometimes theyget unscrupulous and abuse the sys-tem, but generally what lawyers do is VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 January 31, 2000 take the law we pass and use it for ev- erything they are worth to benefittheir client. That is what has happened with the bankruptcy system. Since 1978,\u00d0thelast time we had bankruptcy reform\u00d0lawyers have learned how to manipu-late the law. They have learned how todo things that have in many waysabused the operation of the system. Itleads to hard feelings. It leads to asense of unfairness and frustrationwhen people feel their just debts areunfairly, without justification, wipedout and not paid because of a techni-cality in the bankruptcy law. Peoplehave to spend extraordinary sums ofmoney to litigate an issue in bank-ruptcy court that should be decidedeasily by a clearly written statute. Sowe do have abuse of the system. Nomatter how many filings there are, weneed a system that is fair for the fil-ings that do occur. That is what wehave worked on in these last severalyears. We have a number of basic principles. If a person can pay the debts he or shejustly obligated themselves to pay,that person should pay it or at leastthat portion of it they are able to pay.If they are unable to pay their debts,they ought to be able to wipe them outin bankruptcy. What we are seeing today\u00d0and I am hearing this from people I talk to allover Alabama\u00d0is people who are mak-ing $80,000, $90,000, $100,000 and couldeasily pay back all or part of theirdebts are going into bankruptcy andwiping out every debt they owe. Oftenthey are not paying the people theypreviously agreed to pay when they un-dertook the debt and got the loan orthe benefits from the gas station or theautomobile dealership or the furniturestore. When they got those benefits,they agreed to pay them. The creditorsor businesses don't make as muchmoney as the debtors do, and they areable to go into court and wipe that out.If you think that is not happening, Ican assure you that it happens everyday in America. We allow that underpresent bankruptcy law. There is a sec-tion called substantial abuse that ajudge can use to reduce the abusesunder current law, but what our hear-ings have found is that it is totally in-effective and is almost never utilized inthe American bankruptcy systemtoday. What we are trying to do is legislate precisely what a substantial abuse ofthe system is. For those who can pay apart of their debts, they ought to paythem. What could be more fair? What we have come up with is a sys- tem called needs-based bankruptcy.That is, to the extent to which youneed bankruptcy relief, you get it. Butif you don't need it and can pay yourdebts, you ought to pay some of themor part of them. So the way the act iswritten, if a person can pay 25 percentof their nonpriority unsecured claims\u00d0setting aside as a priority child supportand alimony\u00d0if you can, after payingthat, pay 25 percent of your nonpri- ority unsecured claims, then you oughtto pay those or $15,000, whichever isless, and we give the debtor 5 years inwhich to pay that. That is the kind ofthing I think is the right step. To have a bright line rule and to try to make sure we are not clogging thecourt with too much work, and that weare having a fair system, we have inthe act provisions that say, in effect,that if a person makes above the me-dian American income, they can't beforced to pay back some or all of theirdebt. They can still file, as they alwayshave, in straight bankruptcy. For example, a family of four who makes $44,000 is making the median in-come in America. If they are making$43,000, the presumption that theyought to and they can pay back someof their debt, does not apply to them because they will be making below themedian income. So the new rule changeonly affects those who are makingabove the median income in Americatoday. We think that is fair and rea-sonable. If you are making above themedian income and you can pay backsome of your debts, many times to peo-ple who make less than you do, youought to pay those debts. I think thatis a good step in the right direction. There are a number of other abuses in the system. I mentioned child sup-port and alimony. Under current law,half a dozen categories of debt aregiven repayment priority over childsupport and alimony. The sponsors ofthis bill, Senators G RASSLEY and HATCH , made clear at the very begin- ning we were going to move child sup-port and alimony up to No. 1\u00d0there would not be any debate about that\u00d0even higher than lawyers fees. Ofcourse, the lawyers are not too happyabout that, but that is what we thinkabout it: child support ought to betops. So how anybody could go aroundand suggest, as some have, that thislegislation is unfair to women and chil-dren is beyond my comprehension. It isbaffling to me. I wonder how anyonecan make that complaint and not bedoing it with the most deliberate in-tent to smear this legislation. I thinkthey need to read the bill. It gives the highest, unprecedented priority to child support. If an indi-vidual files bankruptcy and they owealimony or child support, the moneysthey have will go first to pay alimonyand child support before it even paysthe lawyer and the bankruptcy trust-ees. I know that Senator G RASSLEY felt strongly about another reform in thisbill. Many of the people who are owedmoney, creditors, by people who havefiled bankruptcy get a legal notice thatthey are to appear in court. They haveto go out and hire a lawyer to sendthem to the courthouse and fight overa $2,000, $3,500 claim. Oftentimes thelawyer's fees cost more than the personactually collects. This legislationmakes clear that if you have a claim,you can go to court and represent your-self without having to hire a lawyer.I am quite confident that in most cases for smaller claims the bank-ruptcy judges are going to give a fairhearing to those people. Many timesthey will not need to hire an attorneyto represent them in bankruptcy court.That is going to save a lot of money, inmy view, for people who need it anddon't need to be wasting it on unneces-sary court hearings and fees. There has been a real problem with repeat filers. People are repeatedly fil-ing in bankruptcy. That is extraor-dinarily frustrating to people who ob-serve the system. We have a Federalbankruptcy commission made up ofFederal judges and top bankruptcy ex-perts that has expressed its concernabout these repeat filings. We havegood provisions that will eliminatesome of the abuses in repeat filings,something that is long overdue. I felt strongly about, and debated with Senator K OHLand others, the re- form of the unlimited homestead ex-emption. In several States\u00d0Texas,Florida, for example\u00d0no matter howmuch money you owe, you can keepyour house, no matter how valuablethat house is. It is quite clever thatsome people realize this and go out andbuy multimillion-dollar mansions,pour all their assets into those homesand call it their homestead. Then theygo bankrupt and don't pay their ac-countant, their doctor, their lawyer oranybody else, and they are sitting in amultimillion-dollar home. That is notright. Why should people who are liv-ing in modest houses not get paid bysomebody who is living in a houseworth several million dollars? We havehad hearings about that. We havenewspaper articles that actually iden-tify people by name who have moved toFlorida, moved to Texas, buy thesemansions, and don't pay the peoplethey owe. So we have at least capped that exemption at the level of $100,000.I think that is a bit high. However, theStates can lower it. Some States have$15,000 as all you can keep in a home-stead; others have $50,000. But the max-imum now is $100,000, instead of just al-lowing quite a number of States tohave unlimited homesteads. In fact,they will do things such as move out ofa State where they owe a lot of debt,pump all their money into a homesteadin another State, declare bankruptcy,and pay nobody back home where theyleft. That is an abuse we have elimi-nated in the legislation as it is today. We had a common problem with land- lord-tenant. If anybody has managed an apartment duplex, or maybe has hada garage apartment or a few housingunits, and rented those, you know howdifficult the eviction process is. EachState in this country has a complexsystem of eviction procedures so thattenants cannot be unfairly removedfrom their premises. Sometimes theselaws are pretty complex and it takes agood bit of effort before somebody canbe removed if they don't pay their rent,or if they are using drugs on the prem-ises, or destroying the property, or dis-rupting the neighborhood. It is very VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 January 31, 2000 difficult sometimes. But there is a pro- cedure for it, and you can go to Statecourt and evict someone. We are finding that lawyers are run- ning ads in the paper such as this:``Seven months free rent. Call me ifyou have a problem paying your rent.We guarantee you can live rent free forseven months.'' We have ads on that:``Seven months free rent, 100 percentguaranteed in writing. We guaranteeyou can stay in your apartment orhouse 2 to 7 months more without pay-ing a penny of rent.'' How can they do that? They are doing it because they get the person inand tell them to file bankruptcy, andusually they tell them to wait until the last step of the eviction process isabout to be taken in State court, whenthe judge has heard the case and theyare about to rule that you can be evict-ed, presumably. Then they file forbankruptcy. What happens when you file an ac- tion in bankruptcy? It stays, or stops,automatically, all the proceedings inState court. So this stops the evictionproceeding, no matter how close it is tofinality. And then the poor landlords\u00d0who opponents of the bill like to sug-gest are usually big wealthy people,but normally most of the landlords inAmerica have smaller units of housingand don't have legal staffs and an abil-ity to respond\u00d0now they have to go tobankruptcy court. The case is dock-eted, the judge sets a hearing, andsomebody asks for a continuance, andthey have to hire a lawyer. Now thetenant is fussing and saying he wasn'tusing drugs anyway and should not bekicked out. Now we have another trialgoing in Federal court over whether ornot this person should be evicted. Wefound that, in California, 3,886 bank-ruptcy cases were filed simply to stopeviction proceedings by the sheriff's of-fice in Los Angeles. That is an astound-ing number from just one county inAmerica. It is this kind of ad that gen-erates this kind of action. I don't know for sure, but a lot of these people probably didn't need tofile bankruptcy, but we are givingthem a priority and advantages thatother people who don't file bankruptcydon't get. It seems to me that, in ef-fect, we are saying to a landlord: Youhave to be a private charity. You haveto let this person stay in your premisesfor 7 months without paying rent be-fore we can get him out of there, andwe in the law can't do anything aboutit. That is the way the law is written. Well, it is our job as Senators and Members of Congress to fix laws thathave those kinds of loopholes. We aregoing to fix that one. We are not goingto have that kind of abuse continuingto occur in America. It is not right. Itis our responsibility to end this abuse. You can blame the lawyers all youwant, but if the law allows them to doit, they can do it. It is our job to makethe law, not the lawyers who are usingit. We have another idea that I thought about and believe in strongly. I havevisited, in my hometown of Mobile, AL, a credit counseling agency. I spentnearly a full day there. These agenciesare in existence virtually in every townin this country. They are very popular.People, more than you know, have fi-nancial troubles. It is the leading causeof family breakup in America\u00d0finan-cial disputes among spouses. What we need more than we need bankruptcy re-lief in America is a system to encour-age people to be good money managers,to recognize what their income is, toset a budget, and have the whole fam-ily agree to it and stand by it. Whenthat occurs, we can avoid many of theproblems we now see. I will note that I don't dispute at all that quite a number\u00d0perhaps well overhalf of bankruptcies that are filed\u00d0arefiled because of things beyond people'sability to control. Maybe it is becauseof an automobile accident, or a seriousmedical bill, or a business failure, ormaybe a mental illness or somethingelse in the family. So there are rea-sons. But for a large number of Ameri-cans, they don't need to be this bad offin this time of economic growth. A lotof it is just a simple inability to under-stand how to manage their money. A credit counseling agency will bring the entire family in, and they will sitaround the table and prepare a budgetfor the family and help them agree toit and have them sign that agreement.They will help them decide what debtsto pay first. The credit counselingagency will call creditors demandingpayment and say: We are here workingwith this couple. If you will give us 3months to take care of some otherbills, we will start paying you. We willstart paying you so much a month, andwe will pay this debt down. Give usthat chance. Creditors are able to do that on a regular basis. They work out things forthese families and help them to notonly avoid bankruptcy, they help themto pay off their debts and help them togenerate a lifestyle of good moneymanagement, which will continue inthe future and perhaps cause them toavoid filing bankruptcy again in the fu-ture. We like that idea. Our legislation says that before you file bankruptcy, you must at least visitand talk with a credit counseling agen-cy to see if they may be able to helpyou with an alternative to bankruptcy.Frankly, lawyers are not doing that.Basically, what is happening with law-yers today is, they are running ads inthe paper, and people are coming inand meeting with paralegals who fillout the form, and they file the bank-ruptcy; they tell them how much thefee is going to be, and then they tellthem how to get the money for the fee,to use credit cards and everything else,and don't pay any debts, take themoney you make and give it to me asa lawyer fee, and I will file for you assoon as the money is there. That is ba-sically what is happening. It is notgood. We need to be concerned aboutfamilies and try to get them on theright track of thinking about financial obligations and the need to repaythem. So there are some other matters in this bill\u00d0many more matters of greatimport. I am excited about it. I thinkit is overdue. I want to express my ap-preciation again for the leadership ofSenator G RASSLEY . He has steadfastly, fairly, and in a bipartisan way, workedto move this bill to final passage. I am convinced we are on the verge of that now. I thought we were pre-viously. It slipped away from us. Butwe passed it twice in this body I thinkwith overwhelming votes\u00d0one time, Ibelieve with only one ``no'' vote. We are going to pass this bill. It is a good bill. It will make our bankruptcysystem a form of Federal court inwhich people who are unable to paytheir debt can choose to go in and havethose wiped out. We are going to create a system that is better than the current system. Thevast majority of filers will be able towipe out all of the debt like they al-ways have. But for those who can pay,they ought to be made to pay some ofit and to allow the other abuses andcosts that go with it to be eliminated. Attorney fees and litigation can be eliminated. Some people are going tofind maybe there is an alternativethrough a credit counseling agencyrather than going through the processof filing bankruptcy. I think that willbe a good step. I am proud to have worked on this. I am proud to have worked with SenatorG RASSLEY , whom I admire so greatly. I look forward to final passage and sign-ing by the President of this importantlegislation. Thank you, Madam President. I sug- gest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order forthe quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LOTT. Madam President, in a few moments, I will ask unanimousconsent to proceed to the nuclearwaste bill. However, I will withholdthat request until Senator R EIDis able to reach the Chamber. I thought whilewe were waiting on his arrival I wouldgo ahead and make some remarksabout this very important legislation. We will, for the information of all Senators, continue to work tomorrowon the bankruptcy reform package andthe amendments that have been agreedto. We hope to make good progress to-morrow. We will have recorded voteson Tuesday, but as to exactly when wewill be able to finish it will requiresome communication with both sides ofthe aisle. It could be that we will notbe able to finish until sometimeWednesday. After that, of course, wehope to be on the nuclear waste issue. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 Feb January 31, 2000 NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to allow the body tomove forward with regard to the nu-clear waste storage bill. More than 15years ago, Congress directed the De-partment of Energy to take responsi-bility for the disposal of nuclear wastecreated by commercial nuclear power-plants and our Nation's defense pro-grams. Today, there are more than100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel thatmust be dealt with. Quite some time has now passed since DOE was absolutely obligatedunder the NWPA Act of 1982 to beginaccepting spent nuclear fuel from util-ity sites. All across this country, we have sites where nuclear waste products are inopen pools, cooling pools. Many ofthose are filling up. A number of Stateshave a major problem. In my opinion, this is one of the most important environmental issues wehave to face as a nation. We have todeal with this problem. There havebeen billions of dollars spent on it.There has been time put into thinkingabout the proper way to do it. Statesall across this country, from Vermontto Mississippi to Minnesota to Wash-ington, believe very strongly that weneed to address this issue. Apparently today, DOE is no closer in coming up with a solution. This istotally unacceptable. This is, in fact,wrong, so say the Federal courts. Thelaw is clear, and DOE has not met itsobligation, so the Congress must act. I am encouraged that Senator M UR- KOWSKI and his committee have ad- dressed the issue and they have comeup with a different bill than the one weconsidered the year before last. Theyhave made concessions, they havemade improvements, and I thought wehad a bill that was going to be gen-erally overwhelmingly accepted. I do think when we get over proce- dural hurdles, when the final vote istaken on this nuclear waste disposalbill, the vote will probably be in thehigh seventies or eighties when it is ac-tually voted on, and that is an impor-tant point. The Senate will vote byoverwhelming numbers for this legisla-tion, so we need to move through theprocess. I know there is opposition from the Senators from Nevada, and they haveto have an opportunity to make theircase and offer amendments if they feelthe need to do so, as well as other Sen-ators. But I think it is so importantthat we cannot allow it to languish anylonger. It is a bipartisan effort thatcame out of the committee. It is safe,practical, and it is a workable solutionfor America's spent fuel storage needs. This is the proper storage of spent fuel, and it is not being done in a par-tisan way. It is dealt with as a safetyissue. Where is DOE? Well, about whereit is always, I guess. What is their solu-tion? If not this, what? They have not given us any answers or any indications of how they wouldlike to proceed with this. All of Amer- ica's experience in waste managementover the last 25 years of improving en-vironmental protection has taughtCongress that safe, effective waste han-dling practices entail using central-ized, permitted, and controlled facili-ties to gather and manage accumulatedwaste. I took the time to go to Sweden and France and to meet with officials fromthe private sector in Britain. I lookedat how they have dealt with theirwaste problem. They have dealt withit. Sweden has; France has; Britain andJapan; but not the United States. Why?We are the most developed country inthe world, yet we have not dealt withthis very important issue. So after over25 years of working with this problem,DOE has still not made specific plans. The management of used nuclear fuel should capitalize on the knowledge andexperience we have. Nearly 100 commu-nities have this spent fuel sitting intheir ``backyards,'' and it needs to begathered, accumulated, and placed in asecure and safe place. This lack of acentral storage capacity could verypossibly cause the closing of severalnuclear powerplants. These affected plants produce nearly 20 percent of America's electricity.Closing these plants does not makesense. But if we do not do somethingwith the waste, that could be the re-sult. Nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future and mustremain part of the energy mix. Amer-ica needs nuclear power to maintainour secure, reliable, and affordable sup-plies of electricity. At the same time,nuclear power allows the Nation to di-rectly and effectively address increas-ingly stringent air quality require-ments. I challenge my colleagues in the Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, toget this bill done. We spent a lot oftime on it the year before last. We raninto the blue slip problem with theHouse. We will not have that problemwith this bill. The citizens in these communities are looking for us to act. The nuclearindustry had already committed to theFederal Government about $15 billiontoward building the facility by 1998.The industry has continued to pay be-tween $40 and $80 billion in fees forstorage of this spent fuel. It is time for the Federal Govern- ment to honor its commitment to theAmerican people and to the power com-munity. It is time for the Federal Gov-ernment to protect these 100 commu-nities to ensure that the Federal Gov-ernment meets its commitment toStates and electricity consumers. The106th Congress must mandate comple-tion of this program\u00d0a program thatgives the Federal Government title towaste currently stored on-site at facili-ties across the Nation, a site for per-manent disposal, and a transportationinfrastructure to safely move the usedfuel from plants to the storage facility.Again, I have had people express con- cerns to me about how this can be donesafely. I actually took the time to lookat the equipment that is used to movethis spent fuel in other countries, par-ticularly in France, and they have doneit safely, without a single incident\u00d0noproblem ever. Again, they are doing itin France. Can't we do it in America? Our foot dragging is unfortunate. It is unacceptable. Clearly, we must movethis legislation. The only remedy tostop the delays\u00d0and it is a timely ac-tion\u00d0is for the Senate to consider thisin the 106th Congress. Let's move forward and get this leg- islation done. Madam President, I see Senator R EID is here. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST\u00d0 S. 1287 Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senateproceed to the nuclear waste bill, S.1287, following passage of the bank-ruptcy bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. REID. Madam President, reserv- ing the right to object, I say to myfriend, the majority leader, that on thesurface it does appear that somethingneeds to be done with nuclear waste. Ifyou get under the surface, of course,there should be something done. I am not going to give a long dis- sertation now on nuclear waste. Wehave had that in the past. But the factof the matter is, really what shouldhappen is, it should stay where it is.That is what the scientists say. Itcould be safely stored on site in drycast storage containment, as is done inCalvert Cliffs, MD, for the next 100years. The nuclear power industry, which has created this fiasco, wants someoneelse to clean up their mess. They wantit out of their hands. They want theirhands washed of it. The fact of the matter is, we are looking at this legislation. SenatorM URKOWSKI is trying to come up with some alternative. I have been told bythe minority on the Energy Committeethat if that is the case, he is going totry to change the legislation that isnow before this body. That is, the legis-lation now before this body would takethe Environmental Protection Agencyout of the mix; that is, the Environ-mental Protection Agency would notbe setting the standards for YuccaMountain, but it would be given to theNuclear Regulatory Commission,which, in fact, is the one that does li-censing. That really is literally havingthe fox guard the hen house. In this legislation, we simply want things to remain the way they are\u00d0have the Environmental ProtectionAgency set the standards. But we un-derstand there is a lot of agitation bythe very powerful nuclear power indus-try, that wants to move this forward inspite of the fact that it could damage VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 Feb January 31, 2000 the country. We understand that. We hope good sense will prevail becausethe President has said he will veto thislegislation. I think that is the reasonSenator M URKOWSKI , the chairman of the committee, wants to come up withsomething that is going to be such thatit will not create a fight here on thefloor. As the majority leader knows, we have enough votes to sustain a Presi-dential veto. We hope we will not getto the point where that is necessary. Will the leader again state what the request is? Mr. LOTT. The consent would be for the Senate to proceed to the nuclearwaste bill, S. 1287, following passage ofthe bankruptcy bill. Mr. REID. I object to that.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec- tion is heard. Mr. LOTT. I understood the Senator would object. I think it is very important, though, that we move this legislation forward. NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY AMEND- MENTS ACT OF 1999\u00d0MOTION TOPROCEED CLOTURE MOTION Mr. LOTT. Having heard the objec- tion then, I move to proceed to S. 1287and send a cloture motion to the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clo- ture motion having been presentedunder rule XXII, the Chair directs theclerk to read the motion. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: CLOTURE MOTION We the undersigned Senators, in accord- ance with the provisions of rule XXII of theStanding Rules of the Senate, do herebymove to bring to a close debate on the mo-tion to proceed to Calendar No. 180, S. 1287,the Nuclear Waste Amendments Act of 1999: Trent Lott, Frank H. Murkowski, Jim Bunning, Thad Cochran, Kay BaileyHutchison, Mike Crapo, Richard Shel-by, Larry E. Craig, Craig Thomas, JuddGregg, Jeff Sessions, Bob Smith of NewHampshire, Phil Gramm, Slade Gorton,Tim Hutchinson, and Don Nickles. Mr. LOTT. Madam President, the clo- ture vote will occur on Wednesday,February 2. I will notify Members whenthe time has been established. Ofcourse, I will confer with the Demo-cratic leadership about the exact time. In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorumunder rule XXII be waived and the clo-ture vote occur immediately followingthe passage of the bankruptcy bill afterthe use or yielding back of 30 minutesof debate time, equally divided in theusual form. Mr. REID. Reserving the right to ob- ject to that request of the leader, I amconfident that request will be granted.I cannot do it right now, but I am surewe will be able to\u00d0my colleague fromNevada is on an airplane. I want to beable to confer with him. I think we willbe able to do that without a problem. Mr. LOTT. We appreciate that and look forward to conferring with theSenator on that. I will talk to Senator M URKOWSKI , too, about any plans he may have. I know he wants to get thisdone. But he is also sensitive to con-cerns that exist. We will continue to work to find a way to make this happen. Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, if I could say this, too. I say about Senator M UR- KOWSKI , we have been real adversaries on this issue, but I have to say that hehas been a total gentleman about ev-erything he has done on this. As bitteras are some of the pills he has asked usto swallow, the fact of the matter is hehas never tried to surprise me. He hasbeen very open and above board. I ap-preciate that very much about SenatorM URKOWSKI . Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we should go ahead and clarify, there wasnot objection to this? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I do not know how, procedurally, we are goingto go about doing this. I have to talkto Senator B RYAN before I can allow this to go forward. I cannot do thatright now. So I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec- tion is heard. Mr. LOTT. Let me revise that re- quest and/or that notification and seeif we can get unanimous consent thatwe have the cloture vote on Wednes-day, February 3. We will notify Mem-bers exactly what the time will be. Inthe meantime, I ask unanimous con-sent that the mandatory quorum underrule XXII be waived and then not putin the limiting of the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.Mr. LOTT. Let me say, while I be- lieve very strongly that this legislationneeds to be passed and is an issue thathas tremendous environmental con-sequences and concerns we have to ad-dress, I think the Senator from Nevadawould also acknowledge that we havealways been sensitive to the need forhim and his colleague from Nevada toknow what is going on, to not be sur-prised, have a chance to make theirstatements, offer amendments, and re-sist in every way. I am very sympa-thetic to the need for them to havethat opportunity. We will protect theirrights as we go forward. We appreciatethe way the Senator has approached italso. I now withdraw the motion to pro- ceed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has that right. The motion iswithdrawn. Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wisconsin is recognized. Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, what is the pending business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Wellstoneamendment to the bankruptcy legisla-tion.Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 8minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senatoris recognized for 8 minutes. DECISION TO SUSPEND EXECUTIONS IN ILLINOIS Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, earlier today, Governor George Ryan ofIllinois made an announcement that isabsolutely unprecedented for a sittinggovernor since the reinstatement ofthe modern death penalty almost 25 years ago. Governor Ryan plans to ef-fectively block executions in Illinoisby granting stays of all scheduled exe-cutions on a case-by-case basis until aState panel can examine whether Illi-nois is administering the death penaltyfairly and justly. Governor Ryan isright to take this step, because realquestions are being raised aboutwhether innocent people are being con-demned to die. Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 Gregg decision finding the death pen-alty constitutional, Illinois has exe-cuted 12 people and and found 13 peopleon death row to be innocent. This istruly extraordinary. After condemningpeople to death, Illinois has actuallyfound more death row inmates inno-cent than it has executed! Some of theinnocent were exonerated based on anew DNA test of forensic evidence.Others successfully challenged theirconvictions based on inadequate rep-resentation by disbarred or suspendedattorneys or a determination that cru-cial testimony of a jailhouse informantwas unreliable. Illinois has exonerated13 individuals but the numbers are sureto grow, as other cases continue to beinvestigated and appeals make theirway through the courts. What is even more troubling is that the lives of some of these 13 innocentpeople were saved not by the diligenceof defense counsel or a jury or judge,but by a group of students taking ajournalism class at Northwestern Uni-versity. These Northwestern Univer-sity students uncovered evidence,which led to the exoneration of peoplelike Anthony Porter, who spent 15years on death row and came within 2days of execution. The criminal justicesystem failed to do its job. These stu-dents and their journalism professor\u00d0actors very much outside the criminaljustice system\u00d0did the footwork to un-cover exculpatory evidence. GovernorRyan supports the death penalty as aform of punishment in Illinois. I donot. But he has courageously acknowl-edged what many lawyers, scholars,and journalists have argued for sometime: the criminal justice system in Il-linois is broken and it must be fixed. I applaud Governor Ryan for what is unfortunately unusual courage. Manypolitical leaders, even those who maybe personally opposed to the death pen-alty, nevertheless feel it is somehow``political suicide'' to support a mora-torium on executions. They fear being VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:27 2000 labeled ``soft on crime.'' But, last year, the Nebraska legislature passed a mor-atorium initiative, unfortunately, itwas only to be vetoed later by the gov-ernor. But Governor Ryan\u00d0a Repub-lican Governor and the Illinois chair ofRepublican Presidential hopefulGeorge W. Bush's campaign\u00d0has de-cided he will lead the people of Illinoisto expecting more from their criminaljustice system. He has decided to holdout for what should be the minimumstandard of any system of justice: thatwe do all that we can not to execute aninnocent person. As a result of the Governor's action, Illinois is the first of the 38 States withthe death penalty to halt all execu-tions while it reviews the death pen-alty procedure. But the problems of in-adequate representation, lack of accessto DNA testing, police misconduct, ra-cial bias and even simple errors are notunique to Illinois. These are problemsthat have plagued the administrationof capital punishment around the coun-try since the reinstatement of capitalpunishment almost a quarter centuryago. I hope the Federal governmentand the other 37 States with capitalpunishment follow the wisdom of Illi-nois and halt executions until they,too, review their administration of thedeath penalty. At the Federal level, Icall on the President and the AttorneyGeneral to suspend executions untilthe Federal government reviews theadministration of the Federal deathpenalty. Are we certain that the Federal death penalty is being applied in a fair,just and unbiased manner? Are we cer-tain that the Federal death penalty issought against defendants free of evena hint of racial bias? Are we certainthat the Federal death penalty issought evenly from U.S. Attorney dis-trict to U.S. Attorney district acrossthe Nation? I don't think we have aclear answer to these questions. Yet,these are questions, literally, of life ordeath. There isn't room for even a simple mistake when it comes to the ultimatepunishment, the death penalty. For anation that holds itself to principles ofjustice, equality and due process, theFederal government should not be inthe business of punishing by killing. AsGovernor Ryan's spokesperson aptlynoted, ``It's really not about politics.How could anyone be opposed to thiswhen the system is so clearly flawed?'' Let us not let one more innocent per- son be condemned to die. Let us de-mand reform. In a moment, I intend to offer an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. Isuggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the orderfor the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999\u00d0Continued Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pend-ing Wellstone amendment be set asideso I may offer an amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO. 2747 (Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to consumer credit transactions) Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask forits immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. F EIN- GOLD ] proposes an amendment numbered 2747. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of theamendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place in title XI, insert the following: SEC. TRANSACTIONS. (a) D EFINITION .\u00d0Section 1 of title 9, United States Code, is amended\u00d0 (1) in the section heading, by striking `` and `commerce' defined '' and inserting `` , transaction', and`consumer credit contract' defined ''; and (2) by inserting before the period at the end the following: ``; `consumer credit trans-action', as herein defined, means the rightgranted to a natural person to incur debt anddefer its payment, where the credit is in-tended primarily for personal, family, orhousehold purposes; and `consumer creditcontract', as herein defined, means any con-tract between the to a consumercredit transaction.''. (b) A GREEMENTS TOARBITRATE .\u00d0Section 2 of title 9, United States Code, is amended byadding at the end the following: ``Notwith-standing the preceding sentence, a writtenprovision in any consumer credit contractevidencing a transaction involving com-merce to settle by arbitration a controversythereafter arising out of the contract, or therefusal to perform the whole or any partthereof, shall not be valid or enforceable.Nothing in this section shall prohibit the en-forcement of any written agreement to settleby arbitration a controversy arising out of aconsumer credit contract, if such writtenagreement has been entered into by the par-ties to the consumer credit contract afterthe controversy has arisen.''. Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to introduce an amendmentto the bankruptcy reform bill that willprotect and preserve the American con-sumers' right to take their disputeswith creditors to court. There is atroubling trend among credit card com-panies and consumer credit lenders ofrequiring customers to use binding ar-bitration when a dispute arises. Underthis system, the consumer is barredfrom taking a dispute to court, even asmall claims court. While arbitration can certainly be an efficient tool to settle claims, it iscredible and effective only when cus-tomers and consumers enter into itknowingly, intelligently, and volun- tarily. Unfortunately, that is not whatis happening in the credit card and con-sumer credit lending business. One ofthe most fundamental principles of ourcivil justice system is each American'sright to take a dispute to court. Infact, each of us has a right in civil andcriminal cases to a trial by jury. Aright to a jury trial in criminal cases iscontained in the sixth amendment tothe Constitution. The right to a jurytrial in a civil case is contained in theseventh amendment, which provides,``In suits at common law where thevalue and controversy shall exceed $20,the right of trial by jury shall be pre-served.'' It has been argued that Americans are overusing the courts. Court docketsacross the country are said to be con-gested with civil cases. In response tothese concerns, various ways to resolvedisputes, other than taking a disputeto court, have been developed. Alter-natives to litigating in a court of laware collectively known as ``alternativedispute resolution,'' or ADR. Alter-native dispute resolution includes me-diation and arbitration. Mediation andarbitration can resolve disputes in anefficient manner because the partiescan have their cases heard well beforethey would have received a trial datein a court. Mediation is conducted by aneutral third party, the mediator, whomeets with the opposing parties to helpthem find a mutually satisfactory solu-tion. Unlike a judge in a courtroom,the mediator has no independent powerto impose a solution. No formal rulesof evidence or procedure control medi-ation. The mediator and the partiesmutually agree on how to proceed. In contrast, arbitration involves one or more third parties\u00d0an arbitrator orarbitration panel. Unlike mediationbut similar to a court proceeding, thearbitrator issues a decision after re-viewing the merits of the case as pre-sented by all parties. Arbitration usesrules of evidence and procedure, al-though it may use rules that are sim-pler or more flexible than the evi-dentiary and procedural rules that aparty would follow or be subjected toin a court proceeding. And arbitrationcan be either binding or nonbinding. Nonbinding arbitration means the de- cision issued by the arbitrator or arbi-tration panel takes effect only if theparties agree to it after they knowwhat the decision is. In binding arbitration, parties agree in advance to accept and abide by thedecision, whatever it is. In addition,there is a practice of inserting arbitra-tion clauses in contracts to require ar-bitration as the forum to resolve dis-putes before a dispute has even arisen. Now, this is called mandatory arbi- tration. This means that if there is adispute, the complaining party cannotfile suit in court, and instead is re-quired to pursue arbitration. It is bind-ing, mandatory arbitration, and ittherefore means that under the con-tract the parties must use arbitration VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:27 January 31, 2000 to resolve a future disagreement, and the decision of the arbitration panel isfinal. The parties have no ability toseek relief in court or through medi-ation. In fact, if they are not satisfiedwith the arbitration outcome, they areprobably stuck with the decision. Evenif a party believes the arbitrator didnot consider all the facts or follow thelaw, the party cannot file a lawsuit incourt. A basis to challenge a bindingarbitration decision exists only wherethere is reason to believe the arbi-trator committed actual fraud, whichis a pretty unlikely scenario. In contrast, if a dispute is resolved by a court, the parties can potentiallypursue an appeal of the lower court'sdecision. Madam President, because binding mandatory arbitration is so conclusive,this form of arbitration can be a cred-ible means of dispute resolution onlywhen all parties know and understandthe full ramifications of agreeing to it.I am afraid that is not what is hap-pening in our Nation's business climateand economy in a variety of contextsranging from motor vehicle franchiseagreements, to employment agree-ments, to credit card agreements. I amproud to have sponsored legislation ad-dressing employment agreements andmotor vehicle franchise agreements. Infact, I am the original cosponsor, withmy distinguished colleague from Iowa,Senator G RASSLEY , the manager of the bankruptcy reform bill, of S. 1020,which would prohibit the unilateralimposition of binding, mandatory arbi-tration in motor vehicle dealershipagreements with manufacturers. Manyof our colleagues have joined us as co-sponsors. Similar to the problem in the motor vehicle dealership context, there is agrowing, menacing trend of credit cardcompanies and consumer credit lendersinserting binding, mandatory arbitra-tion clauses in agreements with con-sumers. Companies such as First USABank, American Express, and GreenTree Discount Company unilaterallyinsert binding mandatory arbitrationclauses in their agreements with con-sumers, often without the consumers'knowledge or consent. The most common way the credit card companies have done so is oftenthrough the use of a ``bill stuffer.'' Billstuffers are the advertisements andother materials that credit card com-panies insert in envelopes with the cus-tomers' monthly statements. Somecredit card issuers such as AmericanExpress have placed fine-print, manda-tory arbitration clauses on bill stuff-ers. Let's take a look at what I amtalking about. I have in my hand a monthly state- ment mailing from American Express.Let's look inside. First, we have the return envelope to pay your bill. And look at what is onthe envelope. They have attached anadvertisement. So before you can mail your pay- ment, you have to tear this advertise-ment off the back of the envelope. Oth- erwise you won't be able to seal itshut. Then, if you look at what else is in the envelope, here is the monthlystatement. It is a multipage printedform, front and back. On this occasion, even though there was very little activity on this par-ticular account\u00d0one charge and onecredit\u00d0the statement is six pages long.The first page contains informationabout how much you owe American Ex-press, charges made, payments re-ceived, finance charges applied, and soon. The reverse side of the first pagealso contains some fine print informa-tion about the account. Then, if you look at pages 3 and 4 they contain additional fine-print in-formation about the account; for exam-ple, what to do if your card is stolen orlost, and a summary of your billingrights. If you keep reading at this point, you look at pages 5 and 6. They are chockfull of advertising material. Targetstores urge you to shop with them. TheState of North Carolina encouragesyou to plan your next holiday in NorthCarolina. This past spring, in addition to an American Express cardholder beingbombarded with all of this information,American Express cardholders also re-ceived this\u00d0For Your Information,``FYI, A Summary of Changes toAgreements and Benefits.'' The sum-mary is 10 pages long. In addition to the multipage state- ment of charges, terms, and adver-tising material, the cardholder re-ceived another multipage documentwith fine-print terms and conditions. If my colleagues are like me and most Americans, I review the state-ment of charges for accuracy, look athow much I owe, rip off the bottomportion, stick it and my check in thereturn envelope, and mail it to Amer-ican Express. I don't spend a lot oftime reading all of the fine-print infor-mation about the account or the ad. Icertainly would not spend time readinga 10-page summary of changes to mystatement. At most, I might scan theseother pages and bill stuffers, but Iwould not spend time reading them indetail. Let's look at the summary of changes. As I said, it is called, ``FYI, ASummary of Changes to Agreementsand Benefits.'' When you look at theirsummary, there are two things that hityou: The cartoon in the middle and thebig letters, ``FYI'' in the upper left sideof the first page. FYI, for your infor-mation, to me and most Americansmeans that it contains some informa-tion that may be of interest to me butnothing that requires serious thoughtor action from me. In reality, however,the summary of changes is a complex,fine-print document that almost readslike a legal document. It talks aboutchanges to various privileges of theAmerican Express card membership,American Express Purchase ProtectionPlan, Buyer's Assurance Plan, Car Rental Loss and Damage InsurancePlan, and Credit Protection Plan. In addition, the summary contains an arbitration provision on page 2.Even though the document containschanges to the terms of the agreementwith the cardholder\u00d0it actuallychanges the contract between the par-ties\u00d0it is simply labeled as an FYI, foryour information, document. I findthat troubling. If we take a closer look at the arbi- tration provision, this arbitration pro-vision is in condensed, fine print, tosay the least. It is not exactly easy toread, even though this is an enlargedversion of the original. The key clausein this arbitration provision is the fol-lowing: If arbitration is chosen by any party with respect to a claim, neither you nor we willhave the right to litigate that claim in courtor have a jury trial on that claim. I will repeat that. If the cardholder has a dispute with American Express, the cardholder can-not take the claim to court or have ajury trial on the claim. This provisiontook effect on June 1 of last year. So ifyou are an American Express card-holder and you have a dispute withAmerican Express, as of June 1999, youcan't take your claim to court\u00d0evensmall claims court. You are bound touse arbitration, and you are bound tolive with the final arbitration decision. In this case, you are also bound to use an arbitration organization se-lected by American Express, the Na-tional Arbitration Forum. Unfortunately, American Express isn't the only credit card company im-posing mandatory arbitration on itscustomers. First USA Bank, the larg-est issuer of Visa cards, with 58 millioncustomers, has been doing the samething since 1997. Here is the bill stuffer distributed by First USA. This is the inside of a fold-ed, one-page insert. As you can see,similar to the American Express sum-mary, this is another fine-print, con-densed set of terms and conditions. Itcovers a wide variety of topics, includ-ing information on finance charges,termination and foreign currencytransactions. Here in the last columnare the three paragraphs on the arbi-tration provision. The language issimilar to the American Express lan-guage and states that the cardholders'dispute will be resolved by arbitration.The cardholder will not be able to go toa court to resolve the claim. No ``if's,''``and's,'' or ``but's'' about it. Just plainand simple. The cardholder, by virtueof continuing to simply use the FirstUSA card, gives up the right to go tocourt, even small claims court, to re-solve the dispute. Unfortunately, this problem also ex- tends beyond credit cards. It is also agrowing practice in the consumer loanindustry. Consumer credit lenders suchas Green Tree Consumer Discount VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 31, 2000 Company are inserting mandatory ar- bitration clauses in their loan agree-ment. The problem is these loan agree-ments are usually adhesion contracts,which means that the consumer musteither sign the agreement as is or fore-go a loan. In other words, the consumer lacks the bargaining power to have theclause removed. More importantly,when signing on the dotted line of theloan agreement, the consumer may noteven understand what mandatory arbi- tration means. The consumer in alllikelihood does not understand that heor she has written away his or herright to go to court to resolve a disputewith the lender. Arbitration in some ways, of course, is an efficient way to settle disputes.But it has to be entered into knowinglyand voluntarily. That is not what ishappening in either the consumer loanor credit card industries. You might say that if consumers are not pleased with being subjected to amandatory arbitration clause, con-sumers can cancel their credit card, ornot execute on their loan agreement,and they can take their business else-where. Unfortunately, that is easiersaid than done. As I mentioned, FirstUSA Bank, the Nation's largest Visacard issuer, is part of this questionablepractice. In fact, the practice is becom-ing so pervasive that consumers maysoon no longer have an alternative un-less they forego use of a credit card ora consumer loan entirely. I think thatis kind of a hefty price to pay to retainthe longstanding right to go to court. In my opinion, this is a decision that consumers should not be forced tomake. Companies such as First USA,American Express, and Green Treeargue that they rely on mandatory ar-bitration to resolve disputes faster andcheaper than court litigation. Theclaim may be resolved faster, but is itreally cheaper? Is it as fair as a courtof law? I don't think so. Arbitration organizations can charge exorbitant fees to the consumer whobrings a dispute\u00d0often an initial filingfee plus hourly fees to the arbitrator orarbitrators involved in the case. Thesecosts to consumers can be higher thanbringing the matter to small claimscourt and paying a court filing fee. For example, the National Arbitra- tion Forum, the arbitration entity ofchoice for American Express and FirstUSA, the National Arbitration Forumcharges fees that are likely greaterthan if the consumer brought a disputein small claims court. For a claim ofless than $1,000, the National Arbitra-tion Forum charges the consumer a $49filing fee. In contrast, the consumer could have brought the same claim, insmall claims court here in the Districtof Columbia and would have paid a feeof no more than $10. In other words, theconsumer pays a fee to the NationalArbitration Forum that is nearly fivetimes more than the fee for filing aclaim with small claims court. That is bad enough, but the National Arbitration Forum's competitors areeven worse. The American Arbitration Association charges a $500 filing fee forclaims of less than $10,000, or more ifthe claim exceeds $10,000, and a min-imum filing fee of $2,000 if the case in-volves three or more arbitrators. In ad-dition to the filing fee, they alsocharge a hearing fee for holding hear-ings other than the initial hearing\u00d0$150 to be paid by each party for eachday of hearings before a single arbi-trator, for $250 if the hearing is held be-fore an arbitration panel. The Inter-national Chamber of Commerce re-quires a $2,500 administrative fee plusan arbitrator's fee of at least $2,500, ifthe claim is less than $50,000. These fees are greater if the claim exceeds$50,000. This $5,000 or more fee couldvery well be greater than the con-sumer's entire claim. So, as you cansee, the consumer's dispute is not re-solved more efficiently with arbitra-tion. It is resolved either at greatercost to the consumer or not at all, ifthe consumer cannot afford the costs,or the costs outweigh the amount indispute. The unilateral imposition of manda- tory arbitration also raises fairnessconcerns. As I demonstrated earlier,typical cardholders are not likely toever notice the arbitration provision.But even if they notice the provisionand read the fine print, consumers nev-ertheless may not understand thattheir right to court has just beenstripped away. So, what we have hereis a small number of people who willactually read the bill stuffer and aneven smaller number who will under-stand what it means. Another problem with mandatory, binding arbitration is that the lendergets to decide in advance who the arbi-trator will be. In the case of AmericanExpress and First USA, they have cho-sen the National Arbitration Forum.All credit card disputes with con-sumers involving American Express orFirst USA are handled by them. Whatdoes this mean? If you think about it,the arbitrator has a financial interestin reaching an outcome that favors thecredit card company. If the NationalArbitration Forum develops a patternof reaching decisions that favor thecardholder, wouldn't American Expressor First USA strongly consider takingtheir arbitration business elsewhere? Ithink there is a very good chance, Iwould say there is a significant chancethat would happen. There has been one important ruling on the enforceability of mandatory ar-bitration provisions in credit cardagreements. That ruling involved amandatory arbitration provision an-nounced in mailings to Bank of Amer-ica credit card and deposit accountholders. In a 1998 decision by the Cali-fornia Court of Appeals, which theCalifornia Supreme Court refused toreview, the court ruled that the man-datory arbitration clauses unilaterallyimposed on the Bank's customers wereinvalid and unenforceable. As a resultof that decision, credit card companiesin California cannot impose mandatory arbitration in their disputes with cus-tomers. In fact, the American Expressnotice recognizes this fact and noteshere at the bottom that the provisionwill not apply to California residentsuntil further notice from the company.I think that was a wise, well-reasoneddecision by the California appellatecourt, but Americans have no assur-ance that all courts will reach thesame fair and reasonable decision. My amendment extends the wisdom of the California appellate decision toevery credit cardholder and consumerloan borrower in the country. Itamends the Federal Arbitration Act toprohibit the unilateral imposition ofmandatory, binding arbitration in con-sumer credit transactions. Let me beclear. I believe that arbitration can bean efficient way to settle disputes. Iagree we ought to encourage alter-native dispute resolution. But I alsobelieve that arbitration is a fair way tosettle disputes only when it is enteredinto knowingly and voluntarily byboth parties to the dispute. My amend-ment does not prohibit arbitration ofconsumer credit transactions when en-tered into voluntarily and knowingly.It merely prohibits binding, mandatoryarbitration imposed unilaterally with-out the consumer's knowledgeable and/or voluntary consent. Credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly slam-ming the courthouse doors shut on con-sumers, often unbeknownst to them.This is grossly unjust. Let's restorefairness to the resolution of consumercredit disputes. At some point I hope that my col- leagues will join me in keeping thedoors to the courthouse open to allAmerican credit card users and con-sumer credit borrowers. At this time,however, I will not push for a vote onthis issue. I have agreed to withdrawthis amendment with the under-standing from my friend from Iowa,Senator G RASSLEY , the manager of this bill and the chair of the Judiciary Sub-committee on Administrative Over-sight and the Courts, that the issue ofmandatory arbitration in consumercredit agreements will be part of ahearing to be held in the Courts Sub-committee on March 1. That hearingwill address the Federal ArbitrationAct and the problem of mandatory ar-bitration clauses inserted in contractsunilaterally. I appreciate SenatorG RASSLEY 's leadership and cooperation in reaching this accommodation. I lookforward to working with him on thisissue, as well as the broader issue ofthe growing, problematic trend of theunilateral imposition of mandatory ar-bitration in a variety of contracts. I admire the leadership of the Sen- ator on the overall issue in addition tothe fact it has come up and is a seriousproblem in the consumer credit agree-ment area. Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 2000 AMENDMENT NO . 2747 WITHDRAWN Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I withdraw the amendment and yield thefloor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is with-drawn. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have had a chance to discuss this issuewith the Senator from Wisconsin overa long period of time, both at the sub-committee level, the committee level,and during floor action on this billwhich has been going on now since lastOctober, with a long interim for a holi-day break. I appreciate what the Senator from Wisconsin is trying to do. We havejoined together on a bill dealing withone aspect of this problem and thathappens to be a bill which deals witharbitration in the automobile industry.As the lead Member of the Senate onalternative dispute resolution issues, Icertainly do not want alternative dis-pute resolution to be used in unfairways. So following up on the request ofthe Senator from Wisconsin that if wecould make some sort of arrangementfor his not offering his amendment atthis time\u00d0and he has withdrawn it\u00d0Ihave scheduled a hearing in my judici-ary subcommittee on our bill. I hope toair some of these other problems theSenator has raised. I do have a great deal of sympathy for what the Senator from Wisconsin isattempting, but I think more ground-work needs to be done so we all have abetter understanding of these issues be-fore moving ahead at this time. The bottom line, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin\u00d0and I hope he will an-swer yes or no\u00d0is that I wish to makesure he is working with us between nowand our hearing so every commitmentI have made in regard to his offering ornot offering his arbitration amendmentto this bill at this time is to his satis-faction. Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, it is very much to my satisfaction. I amdelighted to know we are going to lookat a variety of contexts at this hearing,including this one with the credit cardcompanies but also the one my col-league and I have had so much interestin regarding motor vehicles and alsothe employment discrimination area.To me, although I would be pleased tohave this amendment on this bill, Ithink that is a good opportunity topoint out the overall problem we havehad, what my colleague described asthe possibility arbitration would beused in a way that neither of us wouldlike, that it would somehow become amethod of unfairness instead of whatwe both hope, which is a way to resolvedisputes more efficiently or economi-cally, sometimes, than when you go tocourt. I think it is an excellent idea. I look forward to working with the chairman in preparation for the hear-ing. I think it is a good way to workout all these issues, and, again, I thankthe Senator from Iowa for being veryeasy to work with on this and being very serious about getting somethingdone. Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I express my appreciation to the man-agers of the bankruptcy bill, SenatorsL EAHY G RASSLEY , and HATCH , for accepting and including an amendment I had planned to offer onthe floor as part of the managers'amendment to S. 625. My amendmentrequires that a simple yet importantdisclosure be made on credit card billsto help protect consumers. During the bankruptcy reform debate in the last Congress, the Senate exam-ined whether the increased rate of con-sumer bankruptcies in the Nation re-sulted solely from consumers' access toan excessively permissive bankruptcyprocess, or whether other factors alsocontributed to this increase. Ulti-mately we concluded that the recordincrease in bankruptcy filings acrossthe nation was due not only to the easewith which one can enter the bank-ruptcy system, but also to the unparal-leled levels of consumer debt\u00d0espe-cially credit card debt\u00d0being run upacross the country. As Senator D URBIN noted, and as the CBO, FDIC, and nu-merous economists have found, therate of increase in bankruptcy filingsparalleled the rate of increase in con-sumer debt. This is not a coincidence. Rather, in- creased bankruptcies proceed directlyfrom the fact that Americans arebombarded daily by credit card solici-tations that promise easy access tocredit without informing their targetsof the implications of signing up forsuch credit. During our debate in the last Con- gress, the Senate also concluded thatirresponsible borrowing could be re-duced, and many bankruptcies averted,if Americans were provided with somebasic information in their credit cardmaterials regarding the consequencesof assuming greater debt. A consensusemerged that credit card companieshave some affirmative obligation toprovide such information to consumersin their solicitations, monthly state-ments, and purchasing materials, inlight of their aggressive pursuit of lessand less knowledgeable borrowers. As a result of this consensus, the Senate's bankruptcy bill in the lastCongress\u00d0S. 1301\u00d0contained severalprovisions in the managers' amend-ment addressing credit card debt, andrequiring specific disclosures by creditcard companies in their payment andsolicitation materials. These provi-sions, which I sponsored along withSenators D ODDand D URBIN , were vital to the Senate's success in adopting bal-anced bankruptcy reform legislation bythe overwhelming margin of 97\u00b11. Unfortunately, the House-Senate conference committee struck these dis-closure provisions from its final con-ference report, leaving the bankruptcybill again a one-sided document thatfailed to account for the role creditcard companies play in the accumula-tion of credit card debt and in in- creased consumer bankruptcy rates. Asa result of the conference committee'sactions, the conference report died inthe waning days of the 105th Congress. As we again debate bankruptcy legis- lation, it remains my firm belief thatCongress must address both sides of theconsumer bankruptcy equation\u00d0boththe flaws in the bankruptcy systemthat make it easy for people to declarebankruptcy even if they have the abil-ity to pay their debts, and the lendingpractices that encourage people withlimited financial resources to accumu-late debts that are beyond their abilityto repay. Last year, the Senate adopted an amendment to S. 625 that requirescredit card issuers to give customerson their billing statements three dis-closures: (1) warning that paying justthe minimum monthly amount will in-crease the interest they pay and thetime it takes to repay their balances;(2) a generic example; and (3) a toll-freenumber a customer can call for an esti- mate of how long he or she has to paythe minimum payment and the totalpayment to pay off his balance. How-ever, the amendment contained an ex-ception for certain credit card issuersthat provide actual, instead of esti-mated, payment information. Such acredit card issuer would not have todisclose the warning, an example, oreven the telephone number. This situa-tion subverted the purpose of this sec-tion and distorted the balance con-tained in the original amendment. My amendment would restore this balance by requiring some disclosuresto be given by certain credit cardissuers that have a toll-free number forinforming customers of the actualnumber of months it takes to repayoutstanding balances using minimummonthly payments requirement. It re-quires such credit card issuers to maketwo disclosures: (1) the telephone num-ber and (2) a warning. My amendmentrequires the credit card bill to containthe statement, ``Minimum PaymentWarning: Making only the minimumpayment will increase the interest youpay and the time it takes to repay yourbalance. For information, .'' If we are going to make it harder for individuals to file for bankruptcy, weneed to make certain that they are in-formed about their credit decisions.The minimal warning contained in myamendment helps credit card cus-tomers who pay the minimum monthlyamount on their credit card bills betterunderstand how long it will take andhow much they will pay to work off thebalance. The Financial Literacy Centerhas calculated that a consumer who,for example, has a $5,000 loan balanceoutstanding on which 17% interest ischarged and who is paying 2% of thebalance each month, will take 50 yearsto pay off the entire loan and end uppaying $33,447. That is a very long timeand a significant burden that, with thedisclosures in my amendment, debtorswill be able to better appreciate. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 January 31, 2000 My amendment helps consumers get important information that will enablethem to analyze how to manage theircredit card borrowing more effectively. MORNING BUSINESS Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, on behalf of the majority leader, I askunanimous consent that there be a pe-riod for the transaction of morningbusiness, with Senators permitted tospeak for up to 10 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY MONTH Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as we come to the end of the first month ofthe new millennium, I want to make afew remarks about the great promise ofbiotechnology in benefitting the Amer-ican public. In fact, January 2000 hasbeen very appropriately designated asBiotechnology Month. In my view, this first century of the new millennium will be remembered byhistorians for revolutionary advancesin biomedical research. It is fittingthat in the next few months scientistswill complete the mapping of thehuman genome\u00d0the basic blueprint ofthe structure of human beings. Thisevent ranks very high in the techno-logical achievements of mankind. It is also noteworthy that this task required the confluence of some of thebest minds in the medical sciences andcomputer technology. Frankly, themapping of the human genome simplywould not have been possible at thistime absent the development of thelow-cost, high-speed computers thathave been available to scientists in re-cent years. Over the next few decadesperhaps no more valuable cargo willtravel down the information highwayof the Internet than the gene maps. This new knowledge will not sit idly in digital databases. For once the de-tailed genetic structure is known andaccessible, researchers will be betterable to understand the function of indi-vidual genes and complex interactionsamong collections of genes. Once bothstructure and function are ascertained,diagnostic tools, therapeutic agentsand preventives such as vaccines can bemore easily developed. It is the Amer-ican public who stands to benefit mostfrom this new knowledge and products. It would be difficult to underestimate the effect that biotechnology will haveon health care delivery and, more tothe point, on the health status of theAmerican public and our neighborsthroughout the world. In the area ofcancer, for example, we are positionedto make substantial gains in knowl-edge that will make traditional treat-ments obsolete. I am pleased that theUniversity of Utah and Myriad Genet-ics, a small Salt Lake City biotechfirm, are at the forefront of the battleagainst breast cancer. Their work onthe BRCA\u00b1I gene has contributed sub-stantially to our understanding of how this terrible disease is triggered geneti-cally. All of us wish success to theseUtah scientists and their colleaguesthroughout the world in their efforts tocurtail breast cancer. Advances in biotechnology will also emanate from the medical device in-dustry. For example, Paradigm Med-ical Industries, another Salt Lake Cityfirm, is refining existing laser tech-nology in order to develop a new``cold'' laser that promises to reducethe adverse reactions rate associatedwith cataract surgery. While I may notbe expert in all the scientificunderpinnings of this new photonphacoemulsification system, I can saythat since over 3 million cataract pro-cedures are performed annually it is inthe interest of the public to cut downon the current corneal burn rate ofabout 1,000 per day. As a representative of the people of Utah, I am proud to report that mystate is home to over 120 companies inthe biosciences. These firms employover 11,000 Utahns and an additional2,500 individuals outside of Utah. Totalannual revenues of these Utah bio-science firms is in excess of $1.6 billion.The aggregate estimated market valueof these firms exceeds $8 billion. The success of Utah in the exciting arena of biotechnology has been facili-tated by the efforts the Utah LifeScience Association\u00d0ULSA\u00d0and theState of Utah's Division of Businessand Economic Development. I mustcommend the leadership of GovernorLeavitt and Brian Moss of ULSA fortheir tireless efforts to promote the ex-pansion of Utah's biotechnology sector. Utah is certainly not alone in its ac- tivity in biotechnology. Nationally,there are over 1300 biotech companies.Collectively, these firms employ over150,000 people. The biotechnology in-dustry accounts for over $10 billion inresearch and discovery activities annu-ally and revenues of over $18 billion. Frankly, despite this impressive record of success, we have onlyscratched the surface of the futurepromise of this industry. About 90 bio-technology products have been ap-proved by the Food and Drug Adminis-tration. More telling of the growingstrength of this industry is the factthat over 350 biotechnology productsare in late stage clinical trials. Asthese products move to the FDA ap-proval stage, it seems foreseeable thatin the next few years this research in-tensive sector, which recorded a netloss of $5 billion in 1998, will move intoand stay in the black. As Chairman of the Judiciary Com- mittee and as a Senator with a longtime interest in health care, I can as-sure my colleagues that I will do all inmy power to ensure that our intellec-tual property laws are structured in away to help assure that the promisingwork in biotechnology laboratories canbe delivered to the bedside of Americanpatients in a fair and expeditious man-ner. To meet the goal of delivering newtherapies to the patients, we must also work to ensure that the FDA regu-latory system promptly and consist-ently renders judgments based onscience and that the laws affectinginternational trade do not result in un-necessary barriers to delivering thesenew breakthroughs worldwide. In closing, I think it only fitting that the Senate has taken special note ofthe almost limitless frontier of bio-technology at the dawn of a new cen- tury and new millennium. Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today in commemoration of Janu-ary 2000, as National BiotechnologyMonth. In November, the Senate passeda resolution designating January 2000as National Biotechnology Month. Biotechnology is changing the face of medicine. The United States leads theworld in biotechnology innovation. Ap-proximately 1,300 biotech companies inthis country employ more than 150,000people. Biotech companies are on thecutting edge\u00d0working to develop inno-vative life-saving drugs and vaccines.The industry spent nearly $10 billionon research and development in 1998while revenues totaled $18.4 billion.Product sales topped $13 billion. Theindustry recorded a net loss of $5 bil-lion. I'm proud that Maryland is home to over 200 biotechnology companies.Companies in Maryland are working tomap the human genome and developdrugs to treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson'sDisease, and diabetes. Biotechnologyhas grown in Maryland, in part becauseMaryland is a place for great medicalinnovations. Maryland is home to the``golden triangle''\u00d0private sectorbiotech companies, federal researchlaboratories, and universities. Mary-land houses the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH), the Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA), other federal labs,outstanding academic research institu-tions such as Johns Hopkins Universityand the University of Maryland, and agrowing number of biotech companies.The combination of these public andprivate sector entities creates a uniqueenvironment for research and newideas to flourish. Biotech companies will likely have an increasingly important role in pro-viding medicines in the 21st century.The number of biotechnology drug ap-provals is increasing. More than 350biotechnology medicines are already inlate-stage clinical trials for heart ail-ments, cancer, and neurological dis-eases and infections. Some of thesedrugs will likely lead the way to im-proved health and well-being for mil-lions of Americans. I salute the bio-technology companies in Maryland andacross the country as they work to im-prove the lives of patients everywhere. Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my col-league Senator H ARRY REID, and Sen- and S ARBANES ary 2000 as National BiotechnologyMonth. VerDate January 31, 2000 It is fitting that in the first month of this new year, at the start of a newcentury, we look to biotechnology asour greatest hope for the future. Mapping the human genome, for ex- ample, is ahead of schedule and nearlycomplete. That achievement, begun 10years ago, will rank as one of the mostsignificant advances in health care byaccelerating the biotechnology indus-try's discovery of new therapies andcures for our most life-threatening dis-eases. Biotechnology not only is using ge- netic research to create new medicines,but also to improve agriculture, indus-trial manufacturing and environmentalmanagement. The United States leads the world in biotechnology innovation. There areapproximately 1,300 biotech companiesin the United States, employing morethan 150,000 people. The industry spentnearly $10 billion on research and de-velopment in 1998. Although revenuestotaled $18.4 billion, the industry re-corded a net loss of $5 billion becauseof the expensive nature of drug devel-opment. In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) approved morethan 20 biotechnology drugs, vaccinesand new indications for existing medi-cines, pushing the number of marketedbiotech drugs and vaccines to morethan 90. Total FDA biotech approvalsfrom 1982 through 1999 reach more than140 when adding clearances for new in-dications of existing medicines. Thevast majority of new biotech drugswere approved in the second half of the1990s, demonstrating the biotechnologyindustry's surging proficiency at find-ing new medicines to treat our mostlife-threatening illnesses. Biotechnology is revolutionizing every facet of medicine from diagnosisto treatment of all diseases. It is de-tailing life at the molecular level andsomeday will take much of the guess-work out of disease management andtreatment. The implications for healthcare are as great as any milestone inmedical history. We expect to see greatstrides early in this century. A devastating disease that has stolen many of our loved ones, neighbors andfriends is cancer. Biotechnology al-ready has made significant strides inbattling certain cancers. This is onlythe beginning. The first biotechnology cancer medi- cines have been used with surgery,chemotherapy and radiation to en-hance their effectiveness, lessen ad-verse effects and reduce chances of can-cer recurrence. Newer biotech cancer drugs target the underlying molecular causes of thedisease. Biotech cancer treatmentsunder development, such as vaccinesthat prevent abnormal cell growth,may make traditional treatments obso-lete. In addition, gene therapy is beingstudied as a way to battle cancer bystarving tumor cells to death. Many biotech drugs are designed to treat our most devastating and intrac-table illnesses. In many cases these medicines are the first ever therapiesfor those diseases. For example, ad-vancements in research have yieldedfirst-of-a-kind drugs to treat multiplesclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis aswell as cancer. Other medicines in clinical trials block the start of the molecular cas-cade that triggers inflammation's tis-sue damaging effects in numerous dis-ease states. In diseases, such as Alz-heimer's, Parkinson's and Hunting-ton's, clinical trials are under way totest a variety of cell therapies thatgenerate healthy neurons to replace de-teriorated ones. Recent breakthroughsin stem cell research have promptedexperts to predict cures within 10 yearsfor some diseases, such as Type I (Juve-nile) Diabetes and Parkinson's. With more than 350 biotechnology medicines in late-stage clinical trialsfor illnesses, such as heart ailments,cancer, neurological diseases and infec-tions, biotechnology innovation will bethe foundation not only for improvingour health and quality of life, but alsolowering health care costs. In the past 2 years Congress has in- creased funding for the National Insti-tutes of Health's basic research pro-grams by 15 percent per year. We are 40percent of the way toward doubling theNIH budget. Health-care research, how-ever, is not one-sided. The public fundswe provide are for basic research. Theprivate sector takes this basic scienceand then spends many times more thanwhat the government has contributedto create new drugs and get them topatients. In today's world, bio-technology companies are among thegreatest innovators and risk takers. Biotechnology also is being used to improve agriculture, industrial manu-facturing and environmental manage-ment. In manufacturing, the emphasishas shifted from the removal of toxicchemicals in production waste streamsto replacement of those pollutantswith biological processes that preventthe environment from being fouled.And because these biological processesare derived from renewable sourcesthey also conserve a traditional energyresource. Industrial biotechnologycompanies are the innovators commer-cializing clean technologies and theirprogress is accelerating at an aston-ishing rate. In agricultural biotechnology, crops on the market have been modified toprotect them from insect damage thusreducing pesticide use. Biotech cropsthat are herbicide tolerant enablefarmers to control weeds without dam-aging the crops. This allows farmersflexibility in weed management andpromotes conservation tillage. Otherbiotech crops are protected againstviral disease with the plant equivalentof a vaccine. The number of acres worldwide plant- ed with biotech crops soared from 4.3million in 1996 to 100 million in 1999, ofwhich 81 million acres were planted inthe United States and Canada. Accept-ance of these crops by farmers is one indication of the benefits they have forreducing farming costs and use of pes-ticides while increasing crop yields. Biotech crops in development include foods that will offer increased levels ofnutrients and vitamins. Benefits rangefrom helping developing nations meetbasic dietary requirements to creatingdisease-fighting and health-promotingfoods. Biotechnology is improving the lives of those in the U.S. and abroad. Thedesignation of January 2000 as NationalBiotechnology Month is an indicationto our constituents and their childrenthat Congress recognizes the value andthe promise of this technology. Bio-technology is a big word that meanshope. Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my Senate colleagues inrecognizing January as National Bio-technology Month. At the dawn of thisnew century, it is fitting for us to rec-ognize the promise and potential ofbiotechnology. With the mapping of the human ge- nome, we are on the brink of criticaladvances in health care and medicaldiscovery. These advances can becomenew cures and new treatments, new in-dustrial products, and improved agri-cultural products. Biotechnology ischanging medical practice from theway diseases are diagnosed to the waythey are treated. By helping us to un-derstand life at the molecular level,biotechnology can help eliminate theguesswork of disease management andtreatment. Biotechnology researchers have al- ready made dramatic strides in con-fronting some of our most devastatingand tragic diseases, from cancer tomultiple sclerosis to Alzheimers. Re-cent breakthroughs in human embry-onic stem cell research have given uscause to predict cures for diseases suchas Parkinsons, juvenile diabetes andspinal cord injury. As Ranking Member of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Edu-cation Appropriations subcommittee, Ihave been a long-time advocate forhealth research. Last year, A RLEN SPECTER and I took the lead in pro- viding the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH) with a $2.3 billion in-crease, the largest in NIH history,bringing the agency's overall budget to$17.9 billion. This year, we plan to in-troduce a resolution calling for a $2.7billion increase\u00d0keeping our commit-ment to double NIH funding over fiveyears. NIH provides funding for the basic science that underpins the importantresearch and development done by thebiotechnology industry. This strongpublic-private partnership has madeour country the world leader in thearea of biotechnology innovation.There are approximately 1300 biotechcompanies in the United States, em-ploying more than 150,000 people. In myown state of Iowa, we have approxi-mately 180 companies, with more than VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 January 31, 2000 10,000 employees. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved 22 bio-technology drugs, vaccines and new in-dications for existing medicines. Wecurrently have more than 90 biotechdrugs and vaccines on the U.S. market.And I know this is only the beginning. In addition to its medical applica- tions, biotechnology offers many excit-ing possibilities in the field of agri-culture as well. Through biotechnologyscientists are already developing newvarieties and strains of plants and ani-mals that will help to solve myriadproblems and challenges relating to ag-riculture. The results of advances inagricultural biotechnology, impressiveas they already are, represent merelythe infancy of this promising scientificfield. The fact that over 800 million of our fellow citizens on this planet sufferfrom hunger or undernourishmentpoints to the tremendous challenge weface to produce enough food for an evergrowing population. As it has in thepast, biotechnology will contribute tre-mendously to meeting that challenge,through increased yields and produc-tion, improved productive efficiencyand enhanced suitability for difficultenvironments. Developing new plantvarieties that are more tolerant ofdrought or soil salinity would help toincrease food production in areas of theworld where people are now going hun-gry. Biotechnology also promises to help solve environmental challenges in agri-culture. For example, plants that areinherently resistant to diseases or in-sects reduce the amount of pesticidesthat would otherwise be applied andenter the environment. Biotechnologycan also help to reduce the amount oftillage that is needed, thereby reducingenergy consumption and soil erosion. Thus far biotechnology has been ap- plied for the most part at the level ofthe farm, and has not been perceivedby consumers as directly benefittingthem to a significant degree. That isabout to change. We are already seeingthe development of new strains ofplants that have specific traits to im-prove the nutritional quality of foodsderived from them. Work at Iowa StateUniversity, for example, has developedsoybeans that produce a soybean oilwith lower saturated fat than conven-tional soybeans. We are not far fromhaving rice that contains Vitamin A,which would alleviate a great deal ofhuman suffering in developing coun-tries. Perhaps the most fascinating area of biotechnology involves the potentialfor developing new crops and livestockdesigned to produce a variety of rawmaterials and substances, likely to beof high value, for use in very specificapplications, including medicine. Wecan produce from plants everything wenow rely on petroleum to produce: en-ergy and industrial raw materials for awide range of products. I believe therewill be real economic opportunities forfarmers in producing these highervalue crops and animals, and for rural communities in processing them. To be sure, if agricultural bio- technology is to meet its potential, wemust ensure that all questions aboutits safety for consumers and for the en-vironment are fully answered. I believethat those questions can and will beanswered satisfactorily, using the bestsound science available. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as January 2000, National Bio-technology Month, comes to a close, Iwant to recognize the importance ofthe biotechnology to the nation and tocommend this industry for its innova-tions in disease diagnosis, treatment,and prevention. The United States is the leader in the biotechnology industry, and I am proudto say that California has the nation'slargest concentration of health caretechnology companies. California,alone, is home to over 2,500 biomedicalcompanies and employs over 241,000people in health care technology andbiomedical and clinical research fields.California's health care technologycompanies are producing leading edgeproducts, for example, the first newtherapy for cystic fibrosis in 30 years,Genetech; technology that enables doc-tors to do heart surgery without open-ing the chest cavity, Heartport; a can-cer drug that is genetically engineeredand stimulates the bone marrow toproduce important white blood cells,Amgen; linear accelerators for treatingcancer, Varian; and intraocular eyelenses, Allergan. Biotechnology has enabled us to re- duce hospital stays, to detect cancerand other life-threatening illnessesearlier in order to begin treatmentsearlier; to attack diseases cell by cellto eliminate unnecessary side effects,and to use vaccines to prevent abnor-mal cell growth. This is a critical timein biotechnology, as scientists con-tinue to make strides in cellular andgenetic research, and I am hopeful thatthis work will improve our health andwell-being. I am confident that as thisindustry continues to grow, we will seetreatments to greatly improve thelives of millions of Americans, and wewill see cures to illnesses that we didnot think were possible. I commend the more than 150,000 em- ployees of the biotech industry nation-wide and join them in observing Janu-ary as National Biotechnology Month. Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of National Bio-technology Month. Biotechnology hasproduced drugs that hold the promisefor many to live healthier lives. Bio-technology also holds enormous prom-ise to make even more profound con-tributions to public health in the fu-ture. For example, biotechnology strate- gies include the development of cancervaccines as well as drugs that targetspecific cancer antigens to stimulate apatient's own immune system to killtumor cells. There are so many otherdiseases that devastate families, likeAlzheimers and heart disease, which biotechnology could be applied to suc-cessfully. The Federal government has in- creased funding for basic scientific re-search. Private sector investments andsmall business development should alsobe encouraged. As remarkable as someof its achievement so far, bio-technology is only beginning. It is ap-propriate to begin the 21st Centurywith National Biotechnology Monthbecause biotechnology holds so muchpromise for medicine and improvingthe quality of life. SUPER BOWL CHAMPION, ST. LOUIS RAMS Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Presi- dent, it is with great pride that I risetoday with my distinguished colleaguesto express my sincere congratulationsto the Super Bowl XXXIV ChampionSt. Louis Rams. In the aftermath of aheart-stopping NFC division victoryover the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and anoutstanding regular season record of 13wins and 3 losses, the St. Louis Ramsincreased their intensity to win SuperBowl XXXIV, bringing home the mostprized possession in the National Foot-ball League, the Lombardi Trophy. Inan extraordinary effort and show ofheart, the Rams countered the incred-ible second-half push by the TennesseeTitans in a game that more than livedup to its billing of ``Super'' and madehistory on Sunday, January 30, 2000, bypulling out a thrilling victory by thescore of 23\u00b116, becoming the SuperBowl XXXIV Champions. This was Coach Dick Vermeil's third year as head coach of the Rams. CoachVermeil previously led the Philadel-phia Eagles to the Super Bowl in 1980,but had been away from coaching foralmost 15 years. The passionate 63 yearold coach showed he still had the stuffit takes to lead this team of stars tothe championship. The fans of profes-sional football have appropriatelyawarded Coach Vermeil by voting himthe Staples Coach of the Year, the onlyNFL honor determined solely by a voteof the fans. The three-year path to glory began slowly, with 9 wins and 23 losses overthe previous two seasons, includingjust 4 victories last season, but theteam turned it around this year. Whilethe Rams were truly a team thatplayed well together all year, this tri-umphant season can be attributed tothe performance of several key players,including six players that were chosento start in the Pro Bowl. Kurt Warner, stepping in as the starter after Trent Green was injuredin an early preseason game, enjoyedone of the best years ever for an NFLquarterback, throwing for 4,353 yards,41 touchdowns and only 13 intercep-tions, a performance worthy of beingawarded the NFL's Most ValuablePlayer and the Pro Bowl starting quar-terback. This remarkable individual, injust his second season in the NFL, was VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 Feb January 31, 2000 bagging groceries in Waterloo, Iowa, just five years ago. While setting pass-ing and scoring records in the ArenaFootball League for 3 seasons and oneseason in the NFL Europe, he nevergave up his dream of playing in theNFL. Last night, he helped to bring thedream of a Super Bowl championshiphome to St. Louis. Marshall Faulk, one of the league's premier running backs, set an NFLrecord this season for combined rush-ing and receiving yards from the line ofscrimmage in a single season with2,429, in addition to scoring 12 touch-downs. He was also chosen to start inthe Pro Bowl. All season long, the team benefitted from a stellar group of talented receiv-ers, led by Isaac Bruce, who will joinhis teammates in the Pro Bowl; TorryHolt; Az-zahir game-winning touch-down in the closing minutes of theRams' win last week over the TampaBay Buccanneers, while Bruce made atruly spectacular play in the fourth-quarter of the Super Bowl by catchinga 73 yard touchdown pass that sealedthe championship. These stars helpedthe Rams to establish early on thatthey were an offensive-minded team,scoring a total of 526 points this sea-son, the third-most in NFL history. But as the saying goes, ``Defense wins championships,'' and the Ramsproved this adage, by leading the NFLin rushing defense, and ranking sixthin the league in overall defense. Thisseason, the Rams' defensive end, KevinCarter, led the league with 17 quarter-back sacks and earned his first start inthe Pro Bowl. After only 5 years in theleague, this outstanding defender hasdeveloped a well-documented workethic that has helped him achieve moresacks over the past two seasons thananyone else in the league. We all know that to be champions re- quires a strong commitment to workharder and be more disciplined thanthe rest. The Rams' Super Bowl win isa credit to the extraordinary efforts bythe entire Rams' organization. Aftermoving to St. Louis in 1995, the man-agement went to work in hiring excel-lent personnel and a committed coach-ing staff. This season, the organiza-tion's slogan was aptly and accuratelyversed: ``Gotta go to work!'' With thewhole organization working as one co-hesive unit and regularly working wellbeyond the hours of 9 to 5, they showedus just how much can be accomplishedwhen everyone works together for acommon goal and is committed todoing more than his or her fair share. We would be remiss if we overlooked another admirable quality of this fineorganization, and that is the commit-ment to the community. When theRams relocated to St. Louis in 1995, theteam identified community involve-ment as one of the top priorities. Sincethat time, many charitable organiza-tions have benefitted from the timeand resources of these big-hearted ath-letes, as various Rams players have dedicated dollars for every touchdown,interception, field goal, sack and more.Some examples of how these stars con-tribute to the community include: 1. The defensive line\u00d0donating $500 for every quarterback sack to a localhomeless shelter. 2. Wide receiver Isaac Bruce\u00d0donat- ing $500 for every touchdown toEdgewood's Childhaven, an educationalcenter for children with learning dis-abilities. 3. Running back Marshall Faulk\u00d0 continuing the ``Marshall Plan'' thatbegan in Indianapolis by donating$2,000 for every touchdown that hescores to the Marshall Faulk Founda-tion. 4. Quarterback Trent Green\u00d0donat- ing $300 for every Rams passing touch-down to the Trent Green Family Foun-dation. 5. Safety Keith Lyle\u00d0donating $500 for every interception to local literacyprograms. 6. Kicker Jeff Wilkins\u00d0donating $50 for every field goal to CardinalGlennon Children's Hospital. 7. Tight end Roland Williams\u00d0donat- ing $86 for every catch to the RolandWilliams Youth Life Line Foundationwhich supports children in Roland'shometown. Most of these players have also been successful in receiving matching com-mitments from local businesses and in-dividuals, helping to foster a true senseof community. In addition, each year,players make countless appearances atlocal schools, hospitals and youth cen-ters to use their influence with chil-dren to stress the importance of edu-cation and making proper choices inlife. The hard work and dedication of the Rams to their team and the people ofthe St. Louis metropolitan area de-serves our highest commendations. So,on behalf of myself and the good peopleof my state of Illinois, I congratulateCoach Dick Vermeil, Super Bowl MostValuable Player Kurt Warner, MarshallFaulk, Issac Bruce, and the entire St.Louis Rams team on an outstandingperformance. Coach Vermeil, players, and fans: congratulations on a great season andan outstanding victory. REPEAL OF THE EFFECTIVE CAP- ITAL GAINS TAX INCREASE INTHE TAX RELIEF EXTENSIONACT OF 1999 Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of S. 2005which would repeal the effective cap-ital gains tax increase contained in theTax Relief Extension Act of 1999. Thislegislation would protect small busi-ness owners from paying taxes onmoney not actually received. Overlooked in last year's legislation was a provision that repealed the in-stallment method for accrual methodtaxpayers when assets or entire busi-nesses are sold. Under this new meth-od, the seller of an asset or business is required to pay taxes on total gains inthe first year of the sale, no matterwhen the actual proceeds are received.S. 2005 would revert this practice to its previous method in which the seller ofan asset only paid taxes on the profitsfrom the installment received in thatyear if he or she should receive pay-ments in increments. While this tax measure provides for only modest tax revenue, the negativeimpact on small business owners thatthis measure affects is quite signifi-cant. In effect, this tax increase crip-ples seller financing of small busi-nesses and prevents thousands of menand women from purchasing smallbusinesses. By potentially reducing thesale price of small businesses by up to20 percent or more, small business own-ers will be much less likely to selltheir businesses. Larger publicly trad-ed corporations are not impacted asthey tend to use other financing meth-ods involving cash or stock trans-actions. So, this tax increase unfairlytargets small business owners alreadyoverwhelmed with federal taxes andregulations. Madam President, it makes common sense that taxes should only be paidwhen profits are realized\u00d0and not onmoney that will not be collected foryears to come. Small businesses are animportant provider of new jobs and adriving force in this nation's economy.We must not penalize or restrict such avibrant source of innovation, inventionand creativity that has enabled theUnited States to realize previously un-imaginable prosperity. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this legislation soessential in the success of this greatnation.

VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 January 31, 2000 STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. H ARKIN ): S. 2015. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for re-search with respect to human embry-onic stem cells; to the Committee onHealth, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. STEM CELL RESEARCH ACT OF 2000 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to send to the desk,on behalf of Senator H ARKIN and my- self, a bill captioned the ``Stem CellResearch Act of 2000.'' It is being intro-duced after a series of four hearings, which have been conducted in the Ap-propriations Subcommittee on Labor,Health, Human Services, and Edu-cation, which I chair and on which Sen-ator H ARKIN is the ranking Democrat. The subject has been a very impor- tant one because approximately 15months ago, there were disclosuresabout stem cell research which pro-vided an opportunity for a veritablefountain of youth. The scientific dis-coveries have found that from the stemcells, new cells may be created whichhave the potential to cure a greatmany severe maladies. For example, onParkinson's disease, stem cells areenormously helpful. There is potentialfor cures on Alzheimer's, on heart ail-ments, and really on the whole range ofhuman ailments, illnesses, and dis-eases. There has been a limiting factor on the use of stem cells because of a provi-sion, which was inserted many yearsago into the appropriations bill for oursubcommittee, which limits Federalfunding on research relating to stemcells. The Department of Health and Human Services has handed down aruling which would permit federal sci-entists to conduct research on stemcells that have been derived by privatesources. The concern has been that the human embryo, subjected to scientific re-search, would potentially destroy life.The fact is that the only human em-bryos which are used as a basis forstem cell research are human embryosfrom discarded in vitro fertilizationclinics. It is not a matter of using ahuman embryo which has the poten-tiality for life to extract the stem cellsbecause these are embryos which havebeen discarded. Notwithstanding the legal opinion handed down by the general counsel ofthe Department of Health and HumanServices, it is our view that there arestill undue restrictions on scientific re-search from existing law. That is whythis legislation has been introduced. Itwill eliminate the ban on the use ofFederal funding for the research onstem cells. There are a number of very impor- tant restrictions. First, the research would not apply to the creation of human embryos forresearch purposes.Second, the research would not result in the cloning of a human being. Third, it would be unlawful for any person receiving Federal funds toknowingly acquire, receive, or transferany human embryos for valuable con-sideration, even if the transfer affectedinterstate commerce. These limitations have been engrafted into the legislation to besure this kind of inappropriate conductis being prohibited. The legal opinion issued by the De- partment of Health and Human Serv-ices covers the statutory prohibitionon the use of funds, stating that humanembryo research would not apply to re-search utilizing human pluripotentstem cells because such stem cells donot constitute a human embryo. How-ever, applying the Federal fundingsolely to pluripotent stem cells is notsufficient because there ought to be anopportunity for broader research, as Ihave suggested. The controversy on stem cell re- search is very similar to the con-troversy which had existed on prohib-iting research on fetal tissue whenmany people advanced the argumentthat it would induce abortions to se-cure fetal tissue. It soon became read-ily apparent that the research on fetaltissue was from discarded fetal tissueand that, in fact, there would not be aninducement of abortions to producefetal tissue for research purposes. Thatis very similar, almost identical, ex-cept for what is involved with the issueof human embryos. Human embryoswhich will not be used for research forstem cells where there is any possi-bility that they might produce life andmay be used only from discarded em-bryos, similarly to the discarded fetaltissue. When the appropriations bill was considered last fall, a provision was in-serted into the committee report whichwould eliminate the prohibition of useof funds for research on stem cells.When it became apparent that this pro-vision would likely stall the progress ofthe appropriations bill, an agreementwas reached to remove that provisionin committee before the bill got to thefloor under an arrangement with ourdistinguished majority leader, SenatorL OTT, who agreed to bring up the legis- lation as a freestanding bill. That isthe legislation Senator H ARKIN and I are introducing today. We intend to have an additional hear- ing within the next several weeks sothat the stage will be set by late Feb-ruary or early March to proceed withthe schedule of this bill as a free-standing measure and so that the Sen-ate may vote up or down and the Houseof Representatives may ultimatelyhave an opportunity to vote as well. Over the past 14 months, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Edu-cation Subcommittee which I chair,held four hearings, the latest on No-vember 4, 1999, to discuss the advancesin stem cell research made by two re-search teams. One team, led by Dr.James Thompson at the University of Wisconsin, and the other headed by Dr.John Gearhart at Johns Hopkins Uni-versity. Stem cell research is one areathat holds particular promise for thedevelopment of future medical treat-ment and cures. Stem cells originatingin an embryo have the unique ability,for a very limited period of time, to be- come any cell type of the body. Thispower, if harnessed by science, couldlead to replacement therapies for fail-ing cells, for example, or lead to organtissues that could be implanted into apatient. Scientists are just beginningpreliminary research into the potentialpractical applications of this line ofwork. At a Senate hearing convened bymy subcommittee on December 2, 1998,Dr. Gearhart testified that he has beenable to induce some stem cells to growinto nerve cells. Other scientists alsostated that cures for Parkinson's, Alz-heimer's, heart disease, diabetes, andother diseases and illnesses that plaguemankind could be greatly acceleratedby stem cell research. Some scientists,for example, believe that stem cell re-search could lead to tangible benefitsto Parkinson's Disease patients in assoon as 7 to 10 years. What has been delaying the advance- ment of this new line of research is aprovision in the Labor-HHS appropria-tions bill that prohibits research onhuman embryos. On January 15, 1999,the Department of Health and HumanServices issued a legal opinion findingthat the statutory prohibition of theuse of funds appropriated to HHS forhuman embryo research would notapply to research utilizing humanpluripotent stem cells because suchcells do not constitute a human em-bryo. But even this limited use of stemcells may be blocked by those who mis-understand its purpose. According toDr. Harold Varmus, the former head ofthe National Institutes of Health, re-search on stem cells is not the same asresearch on human embryos. Stemcells do not have the capacity to de-velop into a human being. While I applaud the HHS ruling, I do not believe that it goes far enough. Toachieve the greatest and swiftest bene-fits, Federal researchers need their ownsupply of stem cells. Therefore, I amproposing this legislation to enableFederally-funded researchers to derivetheir own stem cells from spare em-bryos obtained from in vitro fertiliza-tion clinics. Allowing scientists to con-duct human stem cell research wouldgreatly accelerate advances in manyavenues of study and, in collaborationwith private industry, expedite the pro-duction and availability of new drugsand treatments. Enacting such legisla-tion would clarify the boundaries gov-erning Federally-funded researchersand make clear the commitment ofthis Congress to biomedical research. Let me review the key provisions of this bill: It would amend the Public Health Service Act and give permanent au-thority to the Secretary of Health and VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 January 31, 2000 Human Services to conduct, support, or fund research on human embryos onlyfor the purpose of generating stemcells. Human embryonic stem cellsmay be derived and used in researchonly from embryos that would other-wise be discarded and donated by invitro fertilization clinics and only withthe written informed consent of the do-nors. The Secretary shall issue guidelines governing human stem cell research,including definitions and terms used insuch research. All Federal research protocols and consent forms involving humanpluripotent stem cell research shall bereviewed and approved by an institu-tional review board. The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a report describing theactivities carried out under this sec-tion during the preceding fiscal year,including whether and to what extentresearch has been conducted in accord-ance with this purpose. The following restrictions would apply: (A) The research shall not result in the creation of human embryos for re-search purposes. (B) The research shall not result in the cloning of a human being. (C) It shall be unlawful for any per- son receiving Federal funds to know-ingly acquire, receive, or transfer anyhuman embryos for valuable consider-ation if the transfer affects interstatecommerce. We have heard very compelling testi- mony from many individuals who arehoping for treatments and cures fromstem cell research. One individual, Mr.Richard Pikunis of Malvern, New Jer-sey, a 27 year-old stricken with Parkin-son's Disease, told the Subcommitteehow the disease has affected everyfacet of his young life\u00d0from law schoolgraduation to the birth of his son. Dr.Douglas Melton, a prominent professorat Harvard, told of the struggles of hisson afflicted with juvenile diabetes. Wealso heard from Michael J. Fox, whoimplored us to do more for people withParkinson's disease. Mr. Fox told of hisdaily medication routine and pro-gressing physical and mental exhaus-tion. He asked for the Subcommittee'shelp to eradicate the disease so that hecould dance at his children's weddings.Mr. Fox has just recently announcedthat he is leaving his popular tele-vision series to devote more time to hisfamily and to advocate for more re-search on finding a cure for Parkin-son's disease. Mr. President, these are just a few of the voices pleading with us to allowthis research to move ahead. Whilestem cell research does not guaranteethat a cure will be found, without itthe opportunity to halt their sufferingmay be denied then. The enactment ofthis legislation as soon as possiblecould give thousands of individuals achance to see a cure within their life-time.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the bill be printed in theR ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 2015 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America inCongress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Stem Cell Research Act of 2000''. SEC. 2. RESEARCH ON HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished col-league, Senator S PECTER , in the intro- duction of the ``Stem Cell Research Actof 2000.'' I want to commend SenatorS PECTER for having the leadership and foresight to introduce legislationwhich will broaden federally-fundedscientists to pursue stem cell research,under certain, limited conditions. From enabling the development of cell and tissue transplantation, to im-proving and accelerating pharma-ceutical research and development, toincreasing our understanding of humandevelopment and cancer biology, thepotential benefits of stem cell researchare truly awe-inspiring. Stem cells hold hope for countless patients through potentially lifesavingtherapies for Parkinson's, Alzheimers,stroke, heart disease and diabetes. Alsoexciting is the possibility that re-searchers may be able to alter stemcells genetically so they would avoidattack by the patient's immune sys-tem. But all of these potential benefits could be delayed or even denied to pa-tients without a healthy partnershipbetween the private sector and the fed-eral government. While market interest in stem cell technology is strong, and private com-panies will continue to fund this re-search, the government has an impor-tant role to play in supporting thebasic and applied science that under-pins these technologies. The problem isthat early, basic science is alwaysgoing to be underfunded by the privatesector because this type of researchdoes not get products onto the marketquickly enough. The only way to en-sure that this research is conducted isto allow the NIH to support it. The Department of Health and Human Services ruled last year thatunder the current ban on human em-bryo research, federally-funded sci-entists can conduct stem cell researchif they use cell lines derived from pri-vate sources. This is a positive step for-ward, but it continues to handicap ourresearchers in the pursuit of cures andtherapies that will help our citizens, Last fall, the National Bioethics Ad- visory Commission (NBAC) released itsfinal report, ``Ethical Issues HumanStem Cell Research.'' The Commissionconcluded that stem cell researchshould be allowed to go forward withfederal support, as long as researcherswere limited to only two sources ofstem cells: fetal tissue and embryos re-sulting from infertility treatments.And they recommended that federalsupport be contingent on an open sys-tem of oversight and review. NBAC also arrived at the important conclusion that it is ethically accept-able for the federal government to fi-nance research that both derives celllines from embryos and that uses thosecell lines. Their report states, ``Relyingon cell lines that might be derived ex-clusively by a subset of privately fund-ed researchers who are interested in VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 January 31, 2000 this area could severely limit scientific and clinical progress.'' The Commission goes on to say that ``scientists who conduct basic researchand are interested in fundamental cel-lular processes are likely to make ele-mental discoveries about the nature ofES [embryonic stem] cells as they de-rive them in the laboratory.'' NBAC's report presents reasonable guidelines for federal policy. Our billbans human embryo research, but al-lows federally-funded scientists to de-rive human pluripotent stem cells fromhuman embryos if those embryos areobtained from IVF clinics, if the donorhas provided informed consent and theembryo was no longer needed for fer-tility treatments. The American Soci-ety of Cell Biology estimates that100,000 human embryos are currentlyfrozen in IVF clinics, in excess of theirclinical need. In addition, our language requires HHS and NIH to develop proceduraland ethical guidelines to make surethat stem cell research is conducted inan ethical, sound manner. As it standstoday, stem cell research in the privatesector is not subject to federal moni-toring or ethical requirements. Stem cell research holds such hope, such potential for millions of Ameri-cans who are sick and in pain, it ismorally wrong for us to prevent ordelay our world-class scientists frombuilding on the progress that has beenmade. As long as this research is conducted in an ethically validated manner, itshould be allowed to go forward, and itshould receive federal support. That iswhy Senator S PECTER and I have joined together on legislation that will allowour nation's top scientists to pursuecritical cures and therapies for the dis-eases and chronic conditions whichstrike too many Americans. I urge mySenate colleagues to join us in sup-porting this bill. By Mr. DOMENICI: S. 2016. A bill to authorize appropria- tions for, and to improve the operationof, the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-sion, and for other purposes; to theCommittee on Environment and PublicWorks. THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION AUTHORIZATION AND IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2000 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation impor-tant to the energy security of ourcountry. This legislation entitled the``Nuclear Regulatory Commission Au-thorization and Improvements Act of2000'' not only includes provisions au-thorizing the annual funding for theNuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), but makes essential amend-ments to the Atomic Energy Act of1954. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today will assist the NRCin its efforts to achieve greater effi-ciencies and eliminate outdated re-strictions within our nuclear energysector. As mentioned, this legislationincludes several amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, including the fol-lowing: Eliminating provisions in current law that preclude any foreign owner-ship of power and research reactors lo-cated in the United States. These out-dated provisions are a significant ob-stacle to foreign investment or partici-pation in the U.S. nuclear power indus-try and its restructuring. No valid rea-sons exist to prohibit investors fromcountries such as the United Kingdomfrom participating in the ownership ofnuclear plants in this country. Theprovisions in current law that protectU.S. security interests are unchangedby my legislation. Eliminationg the current statutory requirement that the NRC conduct anantitrust review in connection with li-censing actions. Other federal agenciesalready have comprehensive responsi-bility to enforce antitrust laws affect-ing electric utilities. Requiring theNRC to do independent antitrust eval-uations for licensing actions is redun-dant, time-consuming and unnecessary. Simplifying the hearing require- ments in a proceeding involving anamendment to an existing operating li-cense, or the transfer of an existing op-erating license. The amendment pro-vides that the Commission should notuse formal adjudicatory procedures insuch cases, but rather should complywith the informal rulemaking require-ments contained in the AdministrativeProcedure Act. Giving the NRC the authority to es- tablish such requirements it deemsnecessary to ensure that non-licensesfully comply with their obligations toprovide funding for nuclear plant de-commissioning. This includes jurisdic-tion over non-licensees, i.e., those whohave transferred their license but re-tain responsibility for decommis-sioning. The proposed package also includes legislative provisions sought by theNRC. The foreign ownership and anti-trust review changes just mentionedwere included in the NRC's legislativeproposals last year. Other provisionsrequested by the NRC should serve toenhance nuclear safety and physical se-curity, increase efficiency, and en-hance the economic use of Commissionresources. These changes are necessary to en- sure that nuclear energy remains partof our nation's energy portfolio. Nu-clear energy is a vital ingredient forproviding U.S. base load capacity basedon economic, environmental and elec-tricity needs. Mr. President, I am sure everyone is aware of my strong commitment to nu-clear energy. This conviction is well-founded. One need only consider a fewsimple facts to find justification formy position. Ensuring diversity and reliability in our nation's future energy portfolio isa critical national security concern. Asjust one example, our increasing de-pendence on imported fossil fuel is acause for concern. Last year oil im- ports accounted for 54% of U.S. oil con-sumption. This dependence could cre-ate a national security crisis. This de-pendence may also contribute to an en-vironmental crisis. Similarly, although we continue to invest in renewable energy resources,the hard facts demonstrate that renew-ables alone cannot obtain sufficient en-ergy generation to meet future needs. An article by Richard Rhodes and Denis Beller in the most recent editionof Foreign Affairs argues the case fornuclear energy in detail. Mr. President,allow me briefly to review some factsfound in this article that address somevery important questions. These repeatthe same points I made in a speech atHarvard in October of 1997 and havemade many times since. First, what estimated energy de- mands will the world face? A 1999 report by the British Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engi-neering estimates that the consump-tion of energy will at least double inthe next 50 years and grow by a factorof up to five in the next century. The OECD projects 65% growth in world energy demand by 2020. How can nuclear energy play a role in meeting future energy needs? The anti-nuclear groups are dead wrong. Nuclear power is neither deadnor dying. France generates 79 percentof its electricity with nuclear power;Belgium, 60 percent; Sweden, 42 per-cent; Japan 34 percent; and the UnitedStates, 20 percent. The United Statesremains the largest producer of nuclearenergy in the world, and the U.S. nu-clear industry generated nine percentmore nuclear electricity in 1999 than1998. In order to sustain economicgrowth, China has plans for as many as100 nuclear power plants, and SouthKorea will more than double its capac-ity by building 16 new plants. Nuclear power's advantage is the ability to generate a vast amount ofenergy from a minute quantity of fuel.For example, whereas one kilogram offirewood can produce one kilowatt-hour of electricity and the ratio for oilis one-to-four, one kilogram of ura-nium fuel in a modern light-water re-actor generates 400,000 kilowatts ofelectricity, even without recycling. Nuclear safety and efficiency have improved dramatically in the last dec-ade. For example, the average U.S. ca-pacity factor in 1998 was 80 percent,compared to 58 percent in 1980 and 66percent in 1990. The average productioncosts for nuclear energy are now atjust under two cents per kilowatt-hour,while electricity produced from gascosts almost three and a half cents perkilowatt-hour. Most importantly, radi-ation exposure to workers and wasteproduced per unit of energy have hitnew lows. What about the risks from radioac- tivity? Good evidence exists that exposure to low doses of radioactivity actually im-proves health and lengthens life VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 January 31, 2000 through stimulation of the immune system. Unfortunately, U.S. standards,in particular those established by theEnvironmental Protection Agency,rely on a theory\u00d0the ``linear no-threshold'' theory (LNT)\u00d0that predictsexposure to trivial levels of radiationincreases the risk of cancer. One shouldkeep in mind that the levels argued toincrease risk of cancer by this modelare considerably less than preexistingnatural levels of background radiation.Furthermore, this theory is by nomeans accepted by the entire scientificcommunity. According to recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health, a1,000 megawatt coal-fired power plantreleases about 100 times as much radio-activity into the environment as acomparable nuclear plant. However,the same standards for radioactive re-leases do not apply to coal and nuclearplants. And, experts on coal geologyand engineering have concluded that``radioactive elements in coal and flyash should not be sources of alarm.'' Can we not place more reliance on re- newables? Even if robustly subsidized, renew- ables will only move from their present0.5 percent share to claim no more thanfive to eight percent by 2020. The U.S. leads in renewable energy generation, but such production de-clined by 9.4 percent from 1997 to 1998:hydro by 9.2%, geothermal by 5.4%,wind by 50.5%, and solar by 27.7%. Are we making smart investments for U.S. energy security? Federal R&D investment per thou- sand kilowatt was only five cents fornuclear and coal, 58 cents for oil, and 41cents for gas; however, it was $4,769 forwind and $17,006 for photovoltaics. In brief, we need nuclear. Our eco- nomic growth and security depend onit. The benefits of nuclear outweigh therisks. Renewables cannot fill the gap\u00d0either between today's demands and fu-ture needs or today with nuclear andtoday without. Not only are coal, gasand oil finite resources, but their use isharmful to human health and the envi-ronment. Mr. President, we must not fail to en- sure that nuclear is part of our energymix. Our nation's energy future mustinclude nuclear in order to be suffi-ciently diverse, reliable and adequateto meet future energy needs. The legislation I am offering today will help ensure that nuclear remainspart of our energy mix. Deregulation of the electric utility industry increases the need to keep op-erating costs low enough to be com-petitive. For this reason, nuclear ener-gy's future rides on decreasing costs ofregulation, especially that of the Nu-clear Regulatory Commission. With gentle prodding and some more overt tactics from the Congress, posi-tive changes at the NRC have beenforthcoming. While holding fast to its primary health and safety mission, the NRCneeded to move from a traditional de-terministic approach to a more risk-in- formed and performance-based ap-proach to regulation. In brief, the NRCneeded to achieve a rapid transition toan entirely different regulatory frame-work, streamline its processes, andoffer clear definitions, standards, andrequirements. Let me briefly highlight two of the milestones of the past year: Reactor Oversight.\u00d0The NRC com- menced with a pilot program for thenew reactor licensee oversight process.This process will replace the currentinspections, assessment and enforce-ment processes. Plants will be evaluated in three key areas: reactor safety, radiation safetyand security safeguards. Twenty ``per-formance indicators'' will assess over-all performance in each area. Moststakeholders view this as a big step to-ward more consistent and objective as-sessments. The NRC plans full implementation of this inspection regime for all nu-clear plants this year. Licensing Actions.\u00d0The NRC contin- ued completion of licensing actions ata rate greater than NRC PerformancePlan output measures and continued toreduce the licensing action inventory. For instance, one indicator of greater efficiency in licensing actions is theage of the inventory. 1999 showed con-sistent improvements in turnaroundtime. For fiscal year 1998, the NRC li-censing action inventory included65.6% of licensing actions that wereless than 1 year old; 86% that were lessthan 2 years old; and 95.4% that wereless than 3 years old. By October 1999,95% of the licensing action inventorywas less than 1 year old; and 100% wasless than two years old. These are just two examples. With Congress and industry demanding regu-latory change, the agency is respond-ing. All elements of change, especiallythe overall shift from a deterministicto a risk-informed paradigm, remainwork-in-progress. I believe, however,the general consensus is that the lastcouple years have been very positive. At the same time, the NRC needs our assistance in removing outdated andunnecessary statutory provisions. Thislegislation will achieve that. Mr. President, I close with the same thoughts as Richard Rhodes and DenisBeller: ``Nuclear power is environ-mentally safe, practical, and afford-able. It is not the problem\u00d0it is one ofthe best solutions.''

[From Foreign Affairs, January-February, 2000] T HENEED FOR NUCLEAR POWER (By Richard Rhodes and Denis Beller) A CLEAN BREAK The world needs more energy. Energy mul- tiplies human labor, increasing productivity.It builds and lights schools, purifies water,powers farm machinery, drives sewing ma-chines and robot assemblers, stores andmoves information. World population issteadily increasing, having passed six billionin 1999. Yet one-third of that number\u00d0twobillion people\u00d0lack access to electricity. De-velopment depends on energy, and the alter-native to development is suffering: poverty,disease, and death. Such conditions createinstability and the potential for widespreadviolence. National security therefore re-quires developed nations to help increase en-ergy production in their more populous de-veloping counterparts. For the sake of safetyas well as security, that increased energysupply should come from diverse sources. ``At a global level,'' the British Royal Soci- ety and Royal Academy of Engineering esti-mate in a 1999 report on nuclear energy anclimate change, ``we can expect our con-sumption of energy at least to double in thenext 50 years and to grow by a factor of upto five in the next 100 years as the world pop-ulation increases and as people seek to im-prove their standards of living.'' Even withvigorous conservation, would energy produc-tion would have to triple by 2050 to supportconsumption at a mere one-third of today'sU.S. per capita rate. The International En-ergy Agency (IEA) of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development(OECD) projects 65 percent growth in worldenergy demand by 2020, two-thirds of thatcoming from developing countries. ``Giventhe levels of consumption likely in the fu-ture,'' the Royal Society and Royal Academycaution, ``it will be an immense challenge tomeet the global demand for energy withoutunsustainable long-term damage to the envi-ronment.'' That damage includes surface and air pollution and global warming. Most of the world's energy today comes from petroleum (39.5 percent), coal (24.2 per-cent), natural gas (22.1 percent), hydro-electric power (6.9 percent), and nuclearpower (6.3 percent). Although oil and coalstill dominate, their market fraction begandeclining decades ago. Meanwhile, naturalgas and nuclear power have steadily in-creased their share and should continue todo so. Contrary to the assertions of anti-nuclear organizations, nuclear power is nei-ther dead nor dying. France generates 79 per-cent of its electricity with nuclear power;Belgium, 60 percent; Sweden, 42 percent; Switzerland, 39 percent; Spain, 37 percent;Japan, 34 percent; the United Kingdom, 21percent; and the United States (the largestproducer of nuclear energy in the world), 20percent. South Korea and China have an-nounced ambitious plans to expand their nu-clear-power capabilities\u00d0in the case ofSouth Korea, by building 16 new plants, in-creasing capacity by more than 100 percent.With 434 operating reactors worldwide, nu-clear power is meeting the annual electricalneeds of more than a billion people. In America and around the globe, nuclear safety and efficiency have improved signifi-cantly since 1990. In 1998, unit capacity fac-tor (the fraction of a power plant's capacitythat it actually generates) for operating re-actors reached record levels. The averageU.S. capacity factor in 1998 was 80 percentfor about 100 reactors, compared to 58 per-cent in 1980 and 66 percent in 1990. Despite areduction in the number of power plants, theU.S. nuclear industry generated nine percentmore nuclear electricity in 1999 than in 1998.Average production costs for nuclear energyare now just 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour(kWh), while electricity produced from gascosts 3.4 cents per kWh. Meanwhile, radi-ation exposure to workers and waste pro-duced per unit of energy have hit new lows. Because major, complex technologies take more than half a century to spread aroundthe world, natural gas will share the lead inpower generation with nuclear power overthe next hundred years. Which of the twowill command the greater share remains tobe determined. But both are cleaner andmore secure than the fuels they have begunto replace, and their ascendance should beendorsed. Even environmentalists shouldwelcome the transition and reconsider theirinfatuation with renewable energy sources. CARBON NATIONS Among sources of electric-power genera- tion, coal is the worst environmental of-fender. (Petroleum, today's dominant sourceof energy, sustains transportation, putting itin a separate category.) Recent studies bythe Harvard School of Public Health indicatethat pollutants from coal-burning causeabout 15,000 premature deaths annually inthe United States alone. Used to generateabout a quarter of the world's primary en-ergy, coal-burning releases amounts of toxicwaste too immense to contain safely. Suchwaste is either dispersed directly into the airor is solidified and dumped. Some is evenmixed into construction materials. Besidesemitting noxious chemicals in the form ofgases or toxic particles\u00d0sulfur and nitrogenoxides (components of acid rain and smog),arsenic, mercury, cadmium, selenium, lead,boron, chromium, copper, fluorine, molyb-denum, nickel, vanadium, zinc, carbon mon-oxide and dioxide, and other greenhousegases\u00d0coal-fired power plants are also theworld's major source of radioactive releasesinto the environment. Uranium and thorium,mildly radioactive elements ubiquitous inthe earth's crust, are both released whencoal is burned. Radioactive radon gas, pro-duced when uranium in the Earth's crust de- cays and normally confined underground, is VerDate when coal is mined. A 1,000-mega- watt-electric (MWe) coal-fired power plantreleases about 100 times as much radioac-tivity into the environment as a comparablenuclear plant. Worldwide releases of ura-nium and thorium from coal-burning totalabout 37,300 tonnes (metric tons) annually,with about 7,300 tonnes coming from theUnited States. Since uranium and thoriumare potent nuclear fuels, burning coal alsowastes more potential energy than it pro-duces. Nuclear proliferation is another over- looked potential consequence of coal-burn-ing. The uranium released by a single 1,000-MWe coal plant in a year includes about 74pounds of uranium-235\u00d0enough for at leasttwo atomic bombs. This uranium would haveto be enriched before it could be used, whichwould be complicated and expensive. Butplutonium could also be bred from coal-de-rived uranium. Moreover, ``because electricutilities are not high-profile facilities,''writes Gabbard of the OakRidge National Laboratory, ``collection andprocessing of coal ash for recovery of min-erals . . . can proceed without attractingoutside attention, concern or intervention.Any country with coal-fired plants could col-lect combustion by products and amass suffi-cient nuclear weapons materials to build upa very powerful arsenal.'' In the early 1950s,when richer ores were believed to be in shortsupply, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commissionactually investigated using coal as a sourceof uranium production for nuclear weapons;burning the coal, the AEC concluded, wouldconcentrate the mineral, which could thenbe extracted from the ash. Such a scenario may seem far-fetched. But it emphasizes the political disadvantagesunder which nuclear power labors. Currentlaws force nuclear utilities, unlike coalplants, to invest in expensive systems thatlimit the release of radioactivity. Nuclearfuel is not efficiently recycled in the UnitedStates because of proliferation fears. Thesefactors have warped the economics of nu-clear power development and created a po-litically difficult waste-disposal problem. Ifcoal utilities were forced to assume similarcosts, coal electricity would no longer becheaper than nuclear. DECLINE AND FALL OF THE RENEWABLES Renewable sources of energy\u00d0hydro- electric, solar, wind, geothermal, and bio-mass\u00d0have high capital-investment costsand significant, if usually unacknowledged,environmental consequences. Hydropower isnot even a true renewable, since dams even-tually silt in. Most renewables collect ex-tremely diluted energy, requiring large areasof land and masses of collectors to con-centrate. Manufacturing solar collectors,pouring concrete for fields of windmills, anddowning many square miles of land behinddams cause damage and pollution. Photovoltaic cells used for solar collection are large semiconductors; their manufactureproduces highly toxic waste metals and sol-vents that require special technology for dis-posal. A 1,000\u00b1MWe solar electric plant wouldgenerate 6,850 tonnes of hazardous wastefrom metals-processing alone over a 30-yearlifetime. A comparable solar thermal plant(using mirrors focused on a central tower)would require metals for construction thatwould generate 435,000 tonnes of manufac-turing waste, of which 16,300 tonnes would becontaminated with lead and chromium andbe considered hazardous. A global solar-energy system would con- sume at least 20 percent of the world'sknown iron resources. It would require a cen-tury to build and a substantial fraction ofannual world iron production to maintain.The energy necessary to manufacture suffi-cient solar collectors to cover a half-million square miles of the Earth's surface and to de-liver the electricity through long-distancetransmission systems would itself add griev-ously to the global burden of pollution andgreenhouse gas. A global solar-energy sys-tem without fossil or nuclear backup wouldalso be dangerously vulnerable to drops insolar radiation from volcanic events such asthe 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which causedwidespread crop failure during the ``yearwithout a summer'' that followed. Wind farms, besides requiring millions of pounds of concrete and steel to build (andthus creating huge amounts of waste mate-rials), are inefficient, with low (becauseintermittent) capacity. They also cause vis-ual and noise pollution and are mighty slay-ers of birds. Several hundred birds of prey,including dozens of golden eagles, are killedevery year by a single California wind farm;more eagles have been killed by wind tur- bines than were lost in the disastrous ExxonValdez oil spill. The National Audubon Soci-ety has launched a campaign to save theCalifornia condor from a proposed wind farmto be built north of Los Angeles. A wind farmequivalent in output and capacity to a 1,000\u00b1MWe fossil-fuel or nuclear plant would oc-cupy 2,000 square miles of land and, evenwith substantial subsidies and ignoring hid-den pollution costs, would produce elec-tricity at double or triple the cost of fossilfuels. Although at least one-quarter of the world's potential for hydropower has alreadybeen developed, hydroelectric power\u00d0pro-duced by dams that submerge large areas ofland, displace rural populations, change riverecology, kill fish, and risk catastrophic col-lapse\u00d0has understandably lost the backingof environmentalists in recent years. TheU.S. Export-Import Bank was responding inpart to environmental lobbying when it de-nied funding to China's 18,000\u00b1MWe ThreeGorges project. Meanwhile, geothermal sources\u00d0which ex- ploit the internal heat of the earth emergingin geyser areas or under volcanoes\u00d0are in-herently limited and often coincide with sce-nic sites (such as Yellowstone NationalPark) that conservationists understandablywant to preserve. Because of these and other disadvantages, organizations such as World Energy Counciland the IEA predict that hydroelectric gen-eration will continue to account for no morethan its present 6.9 percent share of theworld's primary energy supply, while allother renewables, even though robustly sub-sidized, will move from their present 0.5 per-cent share to claim no more than 5 to 8 per-cent by 2020. In the United States, whichleads the world in renewable energy genera-tion, such production actually declined by9.4 percent from 1997 to 1998: hydro by 9.2 per-cent, geothermal by 5.4 percent, wind by 50.5percent, and solar by 27.7 percent. Like the dream of controlled thermo- nuclear fusion, then, the realty of a worldrun on pristine energy generated from re-newables continues to recede, despite expen-sive, highly subsidized research and develop-ment. the 1997 U.S. federal R&D investmentper thousand kWh was only 5 cents for nu-clear and coal, 58 cents for oil, and 41 centsfor gas, but was $4,769 for wind and $17,006 forphotovoltaics. This massive public invest-ment in renewables would have been betterspent making coal plants and automobilescleaner. According to Robert Bradley ofHouston's Institute for Energy Research,U.S. conservation efforts and nonhydro-electric renewables have benefited from 20-year taxpayer investment $30-$40 billion\u00d0``the largest govern-mental peacetime energy expenditure in U.S.history.'' And Bradley estimates that ``the$5.8 billion spent by the Department of En- ergy on wind and solar subsidies'' alonecould have paid for ``replacing between 5,000and 10,000 MWe of the nation's dirtiest coalcapacity with gas-fired combined-cycleunits, which would have reduced carbon di-oxide emissions by between one-third andtwo-thirds.'' Replacing coal with nucleargeneration would have reduced overall emis-sions even more. Despite the massive investment, conserva- tion and nonhydro renewables remain stub-bornly uncompetitive and contribute onlymarginally to U.S. energy supplies. If themost prosperous nation in the world cannotafford them, who can? Not China, evidently,which expects to generate less than one per-cent of its commercial energy from nonhydrorenewables in 2025. Coal and oil will still ac-count for the bulk of China's energy supplyin that year unless developed countries offerincentives to convince the world's most pop-ulous nation to change its plan. TURN DOWN THE VOLUME Natural gas has many virtues as a fuel compared to coal or oil, and its share of theworld's energy will assuredly grow in thefirst half of the 21st century. But its supplyis limited and unevenly distributed, it is ex-pensive as a power source compared to coalor uranium, and it pollutes the air. A 1,000-MWe natural gas plant releases 5.5 tonnes ofsulfur oxides per day, 21 tonnes of nitrogenoxides, 1.6 tonnes of carbon monoxide, and0.9 tonnes of partculates. In the UnitedStates, energy production from natural gasreleased about 5.5 billion tonnes of waste in1994. Natural gas fires and explosions arealso significant risks. A single mile of gaspipeline three feet in diameter at a pressureof 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi) containsthe equivalent of two-thirds of a kiloton ofexplosive energy; a million miles of suchlarge pipelines lace the earth. The great advantage of nuclear power is its ability to wrest enormous energy from asmall volume of fuel. Nuclear fission, trans-forming matter directly into energy, is sev-eral million times as energetic as chemicalburning, which merely breaks chemicalbonds. One tonne of nuclear fuel produces en-ergy equivalent to 2 to 3 million tonnes offossil fuel. Burning 1 kilogram of firewoodcan generate 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity; 1kg of coal, 3 kWh; 1 kg of oil, 4 kWh. But 1kg of uranium fuel in a modern light-waterreactor generates 400,000 kWh of electricity,and if that uranium is recycled, 1 kg cangenerate more than 7,000,000 kWh. Thesespectacular differences in volume help ex-plain the vast difference in the environ-mental impacts of nuclear versus fossil fuels.Running a 1,000-MWe power plant for a yearrequires, 2,000 train cars of coal or 10 super-tankers of oil but only 12 cubic meters ofnatural uranium. Out the other end of fossil-fuel plants, even those with pollution-con-trol systems, come thousands of tonnes ofnoxious gases, particulates, and heavy-metal-bearing (and radioactive) ash, plussolid hazardous waste\u00d0up to 500,000 tonnesof sulfur from coal, more than 300,000 tonnesfrom oil, and 200,000 tonnes from natural gas.In contrast, a 1,000-MWe nuclear plant re-leases no noxious gases or other pollutantsn1 and much less radioactivity per capitathan is encountered from airline travel, ahome smoke detector, or a television set. Itproduces about 30 tonnes of high-level waste(spent fuel) and 800 tonnes of low- and inter-mediate-level waste\u00d0about 20 cubic metersin all when compacted (roughly, the volumeof two automobiles). All the operating nu-clear plants in the world produce some 3,000cubic meters of waste annually. By compari-son, U.S. industry generates annually about50,000,000 cubic meters of solid toxic waste. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 31, 2000 n1 Uranium is refined and processed into fuel assemblies today using coal energy,which does of course release pollutants. Ifnuclear power were made available for proc-ess heat or if fuel assemblies were recycled,this source of manufacturing pollution wouldbe eliminated or greatly reduced. The high-level waste is intensely radio- active, of course (the low-level waste can beless radioactive than coal ash, which is usedto make concrete and gypsum\u00d0both ofwhich are incorporated into building mate-rials). But thanks to its small volume andthe fact that it is not released into the envi-ronment, this high-level waste can be me-ticulously sequestered behind multiple bar-riers. Waste from coal, dispersed across thelandscape in smoke or buried near the sur-face, remains toxic forever. Radioactive nu-clear waste decays steadily, losing 99 percentof its toxicity after 600 years\u00d0well withinthe range of human experience with custodyand maintenance, as evidence by structuressuch as the Roman Pantheon and NotreDame Cathedral. Nuclear waste disposal is apolitical problem in the United States be-cause of wide-spread fear disproportionate tothe reality of risk. But it is not an engineer-ing problem, as advanced projects in France,Sweden, and Japan demonstrate. The WorldHealth Organization has estimated that in-door and outdoor air pollution cause somethree million deaths per year. Substituting small, properly contained volumes of nuclearwaste for vast, dispersed amounts of toxicwastes from fossil fuels would produce so ob-vious an improvement in public health thatit is astonishing that physicians have not al-ready demanded such a conversion. The production cost of nuclear electricity generated from existing U.S. plants is al-ready fully competitive with electricity fromfossil fuels, although new nuclear power issomewhat more expensive. But this higherprice tag is deceptive. Large nuclear power plants require larger capital investmentsthan comparable coal or gas plants only be-cause nuclear utilities are required to buildand maintain costly systems to keep theirradioactivity from the environment. If fos-sil-fuel plants were similarly required to se-quester the pollutants they generate, theywould cost significantly more than nuclearpower plants do. The European Union andthe International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) have determined that ``for equivalentamounts of energy generation, coal and oilplants, . . . owing to their large emissionsand huge fuel and transport requirements,have the highest externality costs as well asequivalent lives lost. The external costs aresome ten times higher than for a nuclearpower plant and can be a significant fractionof generation costs.'' In equivalent lives lostper gigawatt generated (that is, loss of lifeexpectancy from exposure to pollutants),coal kills 37 people annually; oil, 32; gas, 2;nuclear, 1. Compared to nuclear power, inother words, fossil fuels (and renewables)have enjoyed a free ride with respect to pro-tection of the environment and public healthand safety. Even the estimate of one life lost to nu- clear power is questionable. Such an esti-mate depends on whether or not, as the long-standing ``linear no-threshold'' theory (LNT)maintains, exposure to amounts of radiationconsiderably less than preexisting naturallevels increases the risk of cancer. AlthoughLNT dictates elaborate and expensive con-finement regimes for nuclear power oper-ations and waste disposal, there is no evi-dence that low-level radiation exposure in-creases cancer risk. In fact, there is good evi-dence that it does not. There is even goodevidence that exposure to low doses of radio-activity improves health and lengthens life,probably by stimulating the immune systemmuch as vaccines do (the best study, of back- ground radon levels in hundreds of thousandsof homes in more than 90 percent of U.S.counties, found lung cancer rates decreasingsignificantly with increasing radon levelsamong both smokers and nonsmokers). Solow-level radioactivity from nuclear powergeneration presents at worst a negligiblerisk. Authorities on coal geology and engi-neering make the same argument about low-level radioactivity from coal-burning; a U.S.Geological Survey fact sheet, for example,concludes that ``radioactive elements in coaland fly ash should not be sources of alarm.''Yet nuclear power development has beenhobbled, and nuclear waste disposal unneces-sarily delayed, by limits not visited upon thecoal industry. No technology system is immune to acci- dent. Recent dam overflows and failures inItaly and India each resulted in several thou-sand fatalities. Coal-mine accidents, oil- andgas-plant fires, and pipeline explosions typi-cally kill hundreds per incident. The 1984Bhopal chemical plant disaster caused some3,000 immediate deaths and poisoned severalhundred thousand people. According to theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, be-tween 1987 and 1997 more than 600,000 acci-dental releases of toxic chemicals in theUnited States killed a total of 2,565 peopleand injured 22,949. By comparison, nuclear accidents have been few and minimal. The recent, much-re-ported accident in Japan occurred not at apower plant but at a facility processing fuelfor a research reactor. It caused no deaths orinjuries to the public. As for the Chernobylexplosion, it resulted from human error inoperating a fundamentally faulty reactor de-sign that could not have been licensed in theWest. It caused severe human and environ-mental damage locally, including 31 deaths,most from radiation exposure. Thyroid can-cer, which could have been prevented withprompt iodine prophylaxis, has increased inUkrainian children exposed to fallout. Morethan 800 cases have been diagnosed and sev-eral thousand more are projected; althoughthe disease is treatable, three havedied. LNT-based calculations project 3,420cancer deaths in Chernobyl-area residentsand cleanup crews. The Chernobyl reactorlacked a containment structure, a funda-mental safety system that is required onWestern reactors. Postaccident calculationsindicate that such a structure would haveconfined the explosion and thus the radioac-tivity, in which case no injuries or deathswould have occurred. These numbers, for the worst ever nuclear power accident, are remarkably low com-pared to major accidents in other industries.More than 40 years of commercial nuclearpower operations demonstrate that nuclearpower is much safer than fossil-fuel systemsin terms of industrial accidents, environ-mental damage, health effects, and long-term risk. GHOSTS IN THE MACHINE Most of the uranium used in nuclear reac- tors is inert, a nonfissile product unavailablefor use in weapons. Operating reactors, how-ever, breed fissile plutonium that could beused in bombs, and therefore the commer-cialization of nuclear power has raised con-cerns about the spread of weapons. In 1977,President Carter deferred indefinitely the re-cycling of ``spent'' nuclear fuel, citing pro-liferation risks. This decision effectivelyended nuclear recycling in the United States,even though such recycling reduces the vol-ume and radiotoxicity of nuclear waste andcould extend nuclear fuel supplies for thou-sands of years. Other nations assessed therisks differently and the majority did notfollow the U.S. example. France and theUnited Kingdom currently reprocess spent fuel; Russia is stockpiling fuel and separatedplutonium for jump-starting future fast-re-actor fuel cycles; Japan has begun using re-cycled uranium and plutonium mixed-oxide(MOX) fuel in its reactors and recently ap-proved the construction of a new nuclearpower plant to use 100-percent MOX fuel by2007. Although power-reactor plutonium theo- retically can be used to make nuclear explo- sives, spent fuel is refractory, highly radio-active, and beyond the capacity of terroriststo process. Weapons made from reactor-grade plutonium would be hot, unstable, andof uncertain yield. India has extracted weap-ons plutonium from a Canadian heavy-waterreactor and bars inspection of some dual-pur-pose reactors it has built. But no plutoniumhas ever been diverted from British orFrench reprocessing facilities or fuel ship-ments for weapons production; IAEA inspec-tions are effective in preventing such diver-sions. The risk of proliferation, the IAEA hasconcluded, ``is not zero and would not be-come zero even if nuclear power ceased toexist. It is a continually strengthened non-proliferation regime that will remain thecornerstone of efforts to prevent the spreadof nuclear weapons.'' Ironically, burying spend fuel without ex- tracting its plutonium through reprocessingwould actually increase the long-term risk ofnuclear proliferation, since the decay of less-fissile and more-radioactive isotopes inspend fuel after one to three centuries im-proves the explosive qualities of the pluto-nium it contains, making it more attractivefor weapons use. Besides extending theworld's uranium resources almost indefi-nitely, recycling would make it possible toconvert plutonium to useful energy whilebreaking it down into shorter-lived, nonfis-sionable, nonthreatening nuclear waste. Hundreds of tons of weapons-grade pluto- nium, which cost the nuclear superpowersbillions of dollars to produce, have becomemilitary surplus in the past decade. Ratherthan burying some of this strategically wor-risome but energetically valuable material\u00d0as Washington has proposed\u00d0it should be re-cycled into nuclear fuel. An internationalsystem to recycle and manage such fuelwould prevent covert proliferation. As envi-sioned by Edward Arthur, Paul Cunningham,and Richard Wagner of the Los Alamos Na-tional Laboratory, such a system would com-bine internationally monitored retrievablestorage, the processing of all separated plu-tonium into MOX fuel for power reactors,and, in the longer term, advanced integratedmaterials-processing reactors that would re-ceive, control, and process all fuel dis-charged from reactors throughout the world,generating electricity and reducing spendfuel to short-lived nuclear waste ready forpermanent geological storage. THE NEW NEW THING The New generation of small, modular power plants\u00d0competitive with natural gasand designed for safety, proliferation resist-ance, and ease of operation\u00d0will be nec-essary to extend the benefits of nuclearpower to smaller developing countries thatlack a nuclear infrastructure. The Depart-ment of Energy has awarded funding to threedesigns for such ``fourth-generation'' plants.A South African utility, Eskom, has an-nounced plans to market an modular gas-cooled pebble-bed reactor that does not cannot ``melt down.'' Eskom esti-mates that the reactor will produce elec-tricity at around 1.5 cents per kWh, which ischeaper than electricity from a combined- cycle gas plant. The Massachusetts Instituteof Technology and the Idaho National Engi-neering and Environmental Laboratory are VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:58 January 31, 2000 developing a similar design to supply high- temperature heat for industrial processessuch as hydrogen generation and desaliniza-tion. Petroleum is used today primarily for transportation, but the internal combustionengine has been refined to its limit. Furtherreductions in transportation pollution cancome only from abandoning petroleum anddeveloping nonpolluting power systems forcars and trucks. Recharging batteries forelectric cars will simply transfer pollutionfrom mobile to centralized sources unlessthe centralized source of electricity is nu-clear. Fuel cells, which are now approachingcommercialization, may be a better solution.Because fuel cells generate electricity di-rectly from gaseous or liquid fuels, they canbe refueled along the way, much as presentinternal combustion engines are. When oper-ated on pure hydrogen, fuel cells produceonly water as a waste product. Since hydro-gen can be generated from water using heator electricity, one can envisage a minimallypolluting energy infrastructure, using hydro-gen generated by nuclear power for transpor-tation, nuclear electricity and process heatfor most other applications, and natural gasand renewable systems as backups. Such amajor commitment to nuclear power couldnot only halt but eventually even reverse thecontinuing buildup of carbon in the atmos-phere. In the meantime, fuel cells using nat-ural gas could significantly reduce air pollu-tion. POWERING THE FUTURE To meet the world's growing need for en- ergy, the Royal Society and Royal Academyreport proposes ``the formation of an inter-national body for energy research and devel-opment, funded by contributions from indi-vidual nations on the basis of GDP or totalnational energy consumption.'' The bodywould be ``a funding agency supporting re-search, development and demonstrators else-where, not a research center itself.'' Itsbudget might build to an annual level ofsome $25 billion, ``roughly one percent of thetotal global energy budget.'' If it truly wantsto develop efficient and responsible energysupplies, such a body should focus on the nu-clear option, on establishing a secure inter-national nuclear-fuel storage and reprocess-ing system, and on providing expertise forsiting, financing, and licensing modular nu-clear power systems to developing nations. According to Arnulf Grubler, Nebojsa Nakicenovic, and David Victor, who studythe synamics of energy technologies, ``theshare of energy supplied by electricity isgrowing rapidly in most countries and world-wide.'' Throughout history, humankind hasgradually decarbonized its dominant fuels,moving steadily away from the more pol-luting, carbon-rich sources. Thus the worldhas gone from coal (which has one hydrogenatom per carbon atom and was dominantfrom 1880 to 1950) to oil (with two hydrogens per carbon, dominant from 1950 to today).Natural gas (four hydrogens per carbon) issteadily increasing its market share. But nu-clear fission produces no carbon at all. Physical reality\u00d0not arguments about corporate greed, hypothetical risks, radi-ation exposure, or waste disposal\u00d0ought toinform decisions vital to the future of theworld. Because diversity and redundancy areimportant for safety and security, renewableenergy source ought to retain a place in theenergy economy of the century to come. Butnuclear power should be central. Despite itsoutstanding record, it has instead been rel-egated by its opponents to the same twilightzone of contentions ideological conflict asabortion and evolution. It deserves better.Nuclear power is environmentally safe, prac-tical, and affordable. It is not the problem\u00d0it is one of the best solutions.ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS S. 148 At the request of Mr. L.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to recognizethe Weyerhaeuser Company's 100th an-niversary on Tuesday, January 18, 2000. In 1990, a group of investors led by Frederick Weyerhaeuser incorporatedthe Weyerhaeuser Company. Withthree employees in Tacoma, Wash-ington, Weyerhaeuser began one hun-dred years of expansion and growthacross our State, Nation and inter-national borders. Today, Weyerhaeuseris the world's largest owner of softwoodtimber, and the largest producer anddistributor of engineered wood prod- ucts. An economic pillar in the Northwest and throughout the nation,Weyerhaeuser employs over 45,000 peo-ple. The company's current success isdirectly related to its commitment tosustainable forestry and communityinvolvement. Frederick Weyer-haeuser's founding vision is captured inhis statement ``this is not for us, it isfor our children.'' Steven R. Rogel,Weyerhaeuser's current chairman,CEO, and president has committed thecompany to ``safety and to being agood corporate citizen. Weyerhaeusercontinues to manage woodlands to sus-tain the supply of wood and protect theecosystem.'' Through product research,Weyerhaeuser has successfully devel-oped new products and services to meetchanging customer demands. Dedicated to the communities which support it, Weyerhaeuser has distrib-uted over $127 million to communitiesfor educational, environmental andother programs. Through the years,Weyerhaeuser has supported recyclingprograms becoming the third largestrecycler in the Nation. The company's24 recycling facilities collect nearlyfour million tons of paper each year. In1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washingtonstate erupted, destroying thousands ofacres of forest. Weyerhaeuser salvagedtimber and replanted 18 million seed-lings in the volcanic area. The com-pany joined the Department of Trans-portation to create the visitor centerat Mt. St. Helens which educates peo-ple about the environment. Over the years, Weyerhaeuser has be- come an international trade leader andan engine adding to the economic suc-cess of Washington state and the entirenation. I would like to congratulatethe Weyerhaeuser Team on its past 100years of business success. I know theirinnovation will carry them through thenext century, and I look forward to thebenefits Weyerhaeuser will continue tobring to the people of WashingtonState. TRIBUTE TO WINI YUNKER Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fineKentuckian, Wini Yunker, as she pre-pares to serve the Peace Corps in theUkraine. Choosing to serve in the Peace Corps is an admirable decision for anyone tomake but, especially for Ms. Yunker,who is making this decision later inlife. At a time in her life when mostpeople are beginning to think of retire-ment and slowing the pace of theirlives, Ms. Yunker is instead boldly ven-turing out on a new journey. She isreaching high for a new goal that willnot only make a lasting impact on herown life, but also on the lives of thoseshe leaves the country to help. Ms. Yunker enters the Peace Corps with the benefit of a lifetime of learn-ing and preparation, making her anideal candidate for service. She com-pleted the necessary academic require-ments by earning a college degree, andfurther earned a master's degree from the Patterson School of Diplomacy andInternational Commerce at the Univer-sity of Kentucky. The Peace Corps was created in 1961, by President John F. Kennedy, and isan international service organizationdedicated to helping developing coun-tries. My wife, Elaine L. Chao, headedthe Peace Corps from 1991 to 1992, andit was under her tenure that serviceprograms in the newly independentstates of the former Soviet Union, in-cluding Ukraine, began. We take greatpersonal pleasure that Ms. Yunker, afellow Kentuckian, will be working in aservice program Elaine helped create.Elaine's leadership of the Peace Corpsmade us both acutely aware of the kindof committed, hands-on approach toservice that participation in the Corpsentails. We applaud you, Ms. Yunker,for accepting the challenges the PeaceCorps will surely present you over thenext two years. The commitment youhave made is admirable and your pas-sion to serve others is an example to usall. Congratulations, Ms. Yunker, on your acceptance into the Peace Corps,and thank you for your enthusiasticwillingness to serve. On behalf of my-self, my wife, and my colleagues in theUnited States Senate, I wish you theall the best. Madam President, I ask that a Louis- ville Courier-Journal article from Jan-uary 18, 2000, be printed in the R ECORD . The article follows: [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Jan. 18, 2000] WOMAN REJECTED G ETSINTOPEACE CORPS (By Chris Poynter) NICHOLASVILLE , KY.\u00d0Thirty-nine years ago, the Peace Corps told Wini Yunker no. She didn't have enough education, the Peace Corps said. But it has now learned that you don't tell Wini Yunker no. She graduated from college at age 58. She learned to ski a year later. At 60, she earned a master's degree from the Patterson School of Diplomacy andInternational Commerce at the University ofKentucky. Now, at 65, she's set to leave her home in Nicholasville to finally join the Peace Corps. At the end of the month, she'll join 30 other Peace Corps volunteers who are teach-ing Ukrainians how to run a business in afree-market democracy, rather than undercommunism; the country was a republic ofthe former Soviet Union until 1991. Yunker, born and raised in Nicholasville, just south of Lexington, said she's joiningthe Peace Corps because she wants a chal-lenge, enjoys teaching and will feel goodabout helping a country become more demo-cratic. ``I'm ready for a new phase in my life,'' she said. The response is typical Yunker, who zigs when others zag. She's never been one to sitaround and wait for life to come to her. Some of her relatives think she's insane for leaving the comfort of her home and fam-ily to spend two years in an emerging democ-racy, where the winters are brutally cold. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:58 31, 2000 Her brother-in-law tried to discourage her, sending her this rhyme: ``If you have anysense in your brain, you will stay away fromthe Ukraine.'' Yunker is one of a number of senior citi- zens who are joining the Peace Corps, whichsince its inception in 1961 has been populatedmainly by freshly minted college graduates.The volunteers dedicate two years of theirlives to working in developing countries. When the Peace Corps was created by President John F. Kennedy, few memberswere senior citizens. This year, 7 percent\u00d0476\u00d0of the volunteers are over 50. BrendanDaly, a spokesman for the agency, said thatfigure has hovered between 6 percent and 8percent in the 1990s, in part because seniorsare more active and more educated than everand are looking for something unusual to do. In some respects, senior volunteers are bet- ter prepared than younger people. They havea wealth of life experiences to share and areenthusiastic about becoming part of a newculture, Daly said. ``They may not be the youngest in years, but they are the youngest in heart,'' he said. Yunker definitely fits that description. Three years ago, she and her only child, 22-year-old Joe, rappelled off the scenic cliffs ofRed River Gorge in Eastern Kentucky. A colleague at work nicknamed her ``Flash'' because she's always darting aroundthe factory at Sargent & Greenleaf inNicholasville, which makes high-securitylocks for banks, vaults and safes. Yunker will officially retire on Friday, after nearly 17 years with the company. Butlast Friday, the 160 employees came togetherto honor Yunker, a silver-haired woman whoalways wears a cheerful smile and is knownfor her long, dangling earrings. Yunker is the administrative assistant to company President Jerry Morgan. Morgantold the employees Yunker will be missed.And he noted the she had raised her son in asingle-parent home but still found time toearn two degrees, volunteer for the UnitedWay and teach in a literacy program, Oper-ation Read. He presented her with a gold watch before she took the microphone. She cried at timesas she read from a prepared speech, and someco-workers dabbed tears from their eyes. Yunker preached about the importance of education and encouraged the company's em-ployees to take advantage of its programthat pays for college tuition if they maintaina B average. That's how Yunker earned her marketing degree from Spalding University. Every thirdweekend for four years, she would driveabout 70 miles to downtown Louisville,where she stayed in a dormitory and studiedas part of Spalding's weekend program. The entire Sargent & Greenleaf factory helped her earn her degree, she said. Workersin the manufacturing, sales and engineeringdepartments aided her with homework, andPatsy Gray, the woman who hired her, proof-read and edited her term papers and essays. While she was a student at Spalding, Yunker remembered that day in 1961 whenshe was living in Washington and went toPeace Corps headquarters to inquire aboutjoining. The Peace Corps was the idea ofPresident Kennedy who, while campaigningin October 1960, proposed an internationalvolunteer organization. Since then, morethan 155,000 Americans, including 1,079 Ken-tuckians, have traveled across the globe,helping people in villages, towns, and citieswith education, health, transportation, busi-ness and other needs. Yunker remembers being disappointed when she was turned away in 1961 becauseshe didn't have a college degree. So, aftergraduating from Spalding, she called to seeif the Peace Corps still existed. When shelearned it did, she began planning to join in seven years, when she would retire and herson would be old enough to live alone. APeace Corps official suggested she earn amaster's degree in the meantime. She did. In 1998, she applied to the Peace Corps and had her employers and others write letters ofrecommendation. Last October, she learnedthat she had been accepted, but with someconditions. For health reasons, she had to have three of her teeth, which had been capped, eitherreplaced or removed. She chose removal tosave money. She also had to have a bunionremoved from one foot. About the same time, Yunker decided to stop coloring her gray hair black. ``I just de-cided I can't continue to be that vain if I'mgoing to be in a foreign country,'' she said. On Jan. 31, she'll fly to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, and take a bus to Cherkassy, a cityof about 300,000 where she'll live with a fam-ily for four months while studying the lan-guage and culture eight hours a day. Then,she'll go to a university\u00d0she doesn't knowwhich one or where\u00d0to teach business. Her biggest concern is learning the lan- guage. She's not worried about the teaching.For six years, she had volunteered for Oper-ation Read, and she recently taught Englishto a Korean immigrant who lives inNicholasville. ``When we started in June, she couldn't speak English at all. And of course, I don'tspeak Korean,'' Yunker said. ``And now, wecan talk about even personal things and haveconversations on the phone.'' Velma J. Miller is among Yunker's co- workers concerned about her living inUkraine. Miller said Yunker, a longtime friend, is the kind of person who brought fresh flowers,food and cards when Miller was undergoingchemotherapy for breast cancer in 1998. When Miller learned that Yunker had to have three teeth removed, she pulled heraside in the restroom and asked, ``Wini, doyou reckon that God's trying to tell you notto go?'' Yunker said her only worry is her five sib- lings, all of whom are older. She made eachpromise not to get sick while she was away. Likewise, Yunker's son is worried, but also excited for his mother. Joe Yunker, an emer-gency medical technician in JessamineCounty, said he knows that being a PeaceCorps volunteer is one of his mother's lifedreams. He's heard about it since he was 11. ``My mom can do anything,'' he said. ``SAINT'' RITA Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, ear- lier this month, the Burlington FreePress chose for its 1999 Vermonter ofthe Year, a woman who is widely recog-nized as the guardian angel of thehomeless in Vermont, Rita Markley.For as long as I have known her, Ritahas been a passionate, articulate, andvery vocal advocate for our most needyresidents. She has raised awarenessthat even in Vermont, there are peoplewithout a roof over their heads, andmost importantly, that these peoplehave names, and faces, and that manyof them are children. They could nothave a better defender. I would like tohave printed in the R ECORD the text of the Burlington Free Press article an-nouncing the selection of Rita asVermonter of the Year, and offer mycongratulations and sincere thanks toour very own ``Saint'' Rita Markley. Iask that the article be printed in the R ECORD . The article reads as follows: [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 1, 2000] COTS D IRECTOR ISOURVERMONTER OF THE YEAR (By Stephen Kieman) They are the problem the world's richest country pretends it doesn't have. Curled upin doorways, or killing time on street cor-ners, they are the vision more fortunateVermonters have learned to look past. In a booming economy, they are the bust. Amid records on Wall Street, they sleep onMain Street. They are the homeless. And Rita Markley does not look past them. She does not pre-tend they do not exist. Most of all, she doesnot stop believing in them. As director of the Committee on Tem- porary Shelter, the largest program for help-ing homeless people in Vermont, Markleyprovides them with shelter, and then a wayup. For her exemplary advocacy on behalf of homeless people, for her unstinting attentionto an urgent social issue, and for her successin building a more aware and compassionatecommunity, Rita Markley is The BurlingtonFree Press Editorial Board's choice forVermonter of the Year. A NEW PROBLEM COTS began providing shelter on Christ- mas Eve, 1982. Homelessness in Vermont isthat recent a phenomenon. Last year morethan 4,000 Vermonters lacked housing atsome point. Most of them turned to COTS. In 1999, COTS provided 10,723 bed nights to people who otherwise would have slept in acar or on the street. COTS also gave shelterto nearly 300 families\u00d0including 534 chil-dren. Indeed one of Markley's achievements has been educating Vermonters about who home-less people are. Granted, some are the both-ersome substance abusers who elicit littlesympathy, but that is a shrinking propor-tion. Many homeless people are veterans. Many are victims of the national trend to closemental hospitals and other institutions, whohave not subsequently received sufficientcommunity services. Mostly, the homeless are people that Vermonters in good homes interact with allthe time\u00d0at restaurants, at cash registers,in hotels. Though this work formerly paidenough to support people, today a full-timejob is no guarantee of a place to live. Of the families who needed COTS last year, half had at least one person working. Yetwages at entry level jobs have fallen so farbehind the cost of living in Vermont, thenumber of homeless families has quadrupledin only four years. Meanwhile the federal government, which used to build affordable housing units by thetens of thousands, has stopped. Urban re-newal programs have demolished low-incomehousing, worsening the supply shortage. Housing development has focused on high- er priced homes; the state's median houseselling price rose 20 percent this decade,placing a solution farther out of reach. The Clinton administration has responded by expanding rental assistance money. Butin Vermont, roughly 1,000 people eligible forthese funds face a major obstacle: no eligibleapartments available. Burlington has itworst, with a vacancy rate near zero. MORE THAN SHELTER Markley came to COTS as a part-timer who wanted to write fiction. Now she is afull-time champion of people who otherwisewould not have a voice\u00d0or a place to go. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 January 31, 2000 COTS offers much more than a meal and a bed, though. It provides a continuum of serv-ices: health care, child care, job training,coaching for interviews, help with school,summer programs for children, mentalhealth counseling, and on and on. For thosewho strive, these programs are a strong lad-der into good housing and greater opportuni-ties. Most importantly, COTS offers its clients hope\u00d0that they can escape dependency andattain self-sufficiency. ``Rita believes in theresourcefulness of the human spirit,'' Way executive director GretchenMorse. ``She never falters on that.'' It works. Seventy percent of the people who complete COTS' training programs havea job and stable housing a year later. A neweffort to link apartment hunters with land-lords who accept federal subsidies has found40 individuals and 60 families a place tolive\u00d0even in this no-vacancy market. COTS has therefore earned the national ac- colades that have poured in from advocacygroups and the U.S. Department of Housing. COMPASSION , ABILITY With so serious a problem affecting so vital a need of a population growing so quickly,you might expect their strongest advocate tobe strident or self-righteous. In Markley'scase, a better description would be jokesterchocaholic. Yes, she is capable of speaking with pas- sion at COTS' annual candlelight vigil. Yes,she is articulate in the Statehouse and be-fore community leaders. And yes, sometimesshe is angry about Washington's indifferenceto the people who are not sharing in the na-tion's prosperity. But Markley uses irreverent humor to pro- tect her from the sometimes grimness of hertask, and to thwart burnout. She is quick topraise others, and effusive in her thanks. As a result she has made homelessness something Vermonters cannot ignore. Some180 businesses support COTS financially orwith in-kind services. Some 1,500 Vermonterswalk for COTS each May. That meansMarkley is helping cultivate compassionacross the community, a good deed that ex-tends far beyond the mission of COTS. It also means COTS has steadily dimin- ished its reliance on government's help, nowreceiving two-thirds of it's funding fromother sources. Services are not tailored tothe eligibility requirements of some grant,but to what a homeless person actuallyneeds. Markley draws on a wealth of skills in her work. Sometimes she is the passionate advo-cate. Sometimes she is the skilled policywonk. Sometimes she is the light-heartedcomic who brings chocolate to a potentiallycontroversial meeting. Sister Lucille Bonvouloir, a founder of COTS, tells a story that reveals a seeminglybottomless reservoir of compassion and abil-ity. A woman came into COTS in the 1980'sand no one could communicate with her. Ev-eryone wondered why the woman would notspeak. Then Markley entered the room, andin a matter of minutes they had struck up alively conversation. In Russian. TRIBUTE TO THE EMPLOYEES OF CATERPILLAR Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, every once in awhile, we are remindedthat all the important issues we areworking on pale in comparison to thecountless acts of charity and compas-sion that occur all across America on adaily basis. I want to recount for mycolleagues one such act, which oc-curred in my home state of Georgia,appropriately enough, during the holi-day season\u00d0an act that puts a humanface on the compassion that is innate in the American people. A.J. Bentley III, 3 1\u00a42years old, is a constituent of mine who is dying ofbrain cancer. While A.J.'s prognosislooks bleak, the disease has not takenaway his passion and fascination withtractors, farm and earth moving equip-ment\u00d0the kind which Georgia isblessed to have plenty. Upon learningof A.J.'s terminal illness, our officecontacted the good people at Cater-pillar to see what they could do to liftthe spirits of a dying boy and his fam-ily. Caterpillar reacted without hesi-tation and pulled out all of the stops.First, Caterpillar offered to have A.J.tour their plant in Peoria, Illinois sohe could see first hand how all theequipment was built and how itworked. Unfortunately, A.J.'s medicalcondition prevented him from beingable to fly to Illinois. Plan ``B'' was tohave A.J. visit the Forest Products Di-vision of Caterpillar in LaGrange,Georgia. On the day his dream wouldbe fulfilled, A.J. was not feeling welland unable to make the 1 hour drive toLaGrange. Undeterred, the people ofCaterpillar would not let A.J.'s illnesskeep them from fulfilling his dream.Because everyone at the LaGrangeplant wanted a chance to help, therewas a lottery that day in LaGrange.The grand prize was the chance todrive to A.J.'s hometown ofThomaston, Georgia and make hisdream come true in person. The luckyfew saw first-hand the joy of a youngboy, decked out in his Caterpillar hatand playing on his new Caterpillarequipment that he loves so much. Asthe group was leaving to return to La-Grange, A.J. waved good-bye, thenwith a burst of energy proclaimed ``thisis the best day of my life''. All whohelped make this possible, I know, feeltheir own happiness that words couldnever adequately express. There are days when all we seem to hear about is how people have becomeso self-absorbed in their own lives. Ioffer this example as a case in point ofthe compassion and good will that ex-ists in LaGrange, in Georgia, and allacross this Nation\u00d0people who aremaking a difference on a daily basis\u00d0one child, one American at a time. I sa-lute the people of Caterpillar and I amhumbled by their act of kindness. Iknow I speak for all of us when I say,A.J. has touched all of our hearts andhe and his family will always be in ourthoughts and prayers. TRIBUTE TO DR. M. GAZI YASARGIL Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to theachievements of a distinguished mem-ber of the Arkansas medical commu-nity. Dr. M.

I am equallyproud of the quality care and cuttingedge medical service the people at theUniversity of Arkansas MedicalSciences provide so that Dr. Yasargilcan share his talents. UAMS has beenthe state's primary source forhealthcare education, biomedical andbiotechnology research and clinicalcare for more than 100 years. The qual-ity work and service that UAMS andDr. Yasargil continue to provide shouldbe a great source of pride for Arkan-sans. TRIBUTE TO C.M. NEWTON Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friendand fellow Kentuckian C.M. Newton onthe occasion of his retirement as Ath-letics Director at the University ofKentucky. C.M. Newton has made contributions to the University that are as great innumber as they are significant in ac-complishment in his 11 years as Wild-cats Athletics Director. The positivechanges and improvements he imple-mented over the years culminate intoan unmatched legacy of excellence forC.M. and for the entire University ofKentucky community. C.M.'s involvement with the Wildcats began long before his tenure as Ath-letics Director. He attended U.K. andreceived a bachelor's degree in 1952,and earned a masters degree in 1957.During his undergraduate years, C.M.played on the Wildcats basketball teamand lettered on their 1951 NCAA cham-pionship team. He also pitched for theU.K. baseball team, and played quar-terback for a Wildcats intramural foot-ball team. In the years between his graduation from the University of Kentucky andhis return in 1989, C.M. began his pro-fessional career in athletics. Whileserving in the Air Force in 1953, C.M.held his first official leadership posi-tion in athletics as the athletic officerfor Andrews Air Force Base in Wash-ington, D.C. He served as head basket-ball coach with Transylvania Univer-sity, the University of Alabama, andVanderbilt University, with a lifetimecoaching record of 509 wins and 375losses. He also served as AssistantCommissioner for the SoutheasternConference (SEC). C.M. approached these positions of leadership with a vigor, integrity, and enthusiasm thatthe world of sports took notice of bynaming him Associated Press South-eastern Conference Coach of the Yearin 1972, 1976, 1988 and 1989 and UnitedPress International SEC Coach of theYear in 1972, 1978, and 1988.

It was with this vast list of accom- plishments and honors that C.M. choseto return to the University of Ken-tucky on April 1, 1989. C.M. hit theground running as Athletics Directorand with his already well-establishedreputation for excellence and integrity,brought winning coaches and playersto the Wildcats athletics programs.During C.M.'s leadership at U.K., thebasketball and football teams soared,the men's and women's soccer teamsreceived national attention, and theprogram grew to include 22 varsitysports\u00d0more than any other school inthe SEC. The Wildcats athletic budgethas more than tripled under C.M.'s ten-ure, allowing the school to expand andrenovate several of the campus athleticfacilities. More than anything, though, C.M. Newton rejuvenated an excitementabout athletics at the University ofKentucky. He led the Wildcats in a waythat commanded respect\u00d0he led withdignity and embodied integrity. Thank you, C.M., for your 11 years of dedicated service to the University ofKentucky, which resulted in winningteams, winning kids, and a top-qualityprogram. Your spirit and legacy willcontinue to drive the Wildcats to vic-tory for years to come. Best wishes inyour retirement and may God blessyou, Evelyn, and your family in thisnext phase of your life. TRIBUTE TO HAZEL WOLF Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is with great respect and admirationthat I rise today to pay tribute to Ms.Hazel Wolf, of Seattle, Washington,who passed away at the age of 101 onWednesday, January 19, 2000. A tirelessadvocate for conservation and socialjustice, Ms. Wolf was an outstandingexample for all Americans. She com-bined humor with persistence as sheset about combating injustice. She willcontinue to live in the hearts andminds of the many who knew her. Andthere are many, for Hazel had the re-markable ability to engage just aboutanyone, from Senator to second grader. Hazel Wolf was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on March 10, 1898. In1923, she moved to the United States with her daughter, Nydia. She was aunion organizer for the Works ProgressAdministration and avidly followedpolitics, eventually becoming a Demo-crat. Until 1965, she worked as a legalsecretary for the Seattle civil rightslawyer John Caughlan. It wasn't untilher retirement that she became suchan involved environmental activist andleader. Ms. Wolf began working with the Au- dubon Society in the early-1960s andhelped start 21 of the 26 Audubon Soci-ety chapters in Washington State. In1979, she worked to organize the firststatewide conference to bring togetherenvironmentalists and Native Amer-ican tribes, the Indian ConservationistConference. She served as Secretary ofthe Seattle Audubon Society chapterfor three decades, and for 17 years sheedited an environmental newsletter,`Outdoors West'. In 1990, her discus-sions with a Soviet delegation led tothe creation of the Leningrad AudubonSociety in Russia. Ms. Wolf was also a founder of Seattle's Community Coali-tion for Environmental Justice, whichworks to improve environmental safetyin poor city neighborhoods. She alsobelonged to the Sierra Club,Greenpeace and the Earth Island Insti-tute. Ms. Wolf was a frequent and fa-vorite speaker at schools and environ-mental conferences throughout theNorthwest. In 1997, the National Audubon Soci- ety awarded her the prestigious Audu-bon Medal, for Excellence in Environ-mental Achievement. She received nu-merous other awards, including theState of Washington EnvironmentalExcellence Award, the National Audu-bon Society's Conservationist of theYear Award and the Washington StateLegislature Award for environmentalwork. To celebrate her 100th birthdayin 1998, the Seattle Audubon chaptercreated the Hazel Wolf ``Kids for theEnvironment'' endowment, which willfund programs to provide urban chil-dren from lower-income communitieswith opportunities to experience thenatural world. In Issaquah, Wash-ington, there is a 116-acre wetlandnamed after her. On the other side ofthe Cascade Mountains near Yakima, abird sanctuary bears her name. Hazel Wolf served as the environ- mental conscience of the Northwest,with her dedication to protecting for-ests, saving salmon, educating youngpeople and preserving the outdoors forfuture generations to enjoy. The mostsignificant and important tribute wecan give to Hazel Wolf is to continuethe work which she pursued with suchvision and passion. We will miss youHazel, but rest assured, we will con-tinue the work you started. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 January 31, 2000 AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION Mr. GRASSLEY.

FISHERPOST OFFICE'' HON. FRANK R. WOLF OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege as the representative of the 10th CongressionalDistrict of Virginia to introduce today legisla-tion which would designate two U.S. postalbuildings located in Northern Virginia to honorformer Congressmen Joel T. Broyhill and Jo-seph L. Fisher, both of whom served as therepresentative of Virginia's 10th District. Join-ing me in support Virginia Con-gressmen T OMDAVISand JIMMORAN. THEHONORABLE JOELT. BROYHILL Born in Hopewell, Virginia, November 4, 1919, the Honorable Joel T. Broyhill was firstelected to the Eighty-third Congress in 1952as a Republican and served for 22 years asthe representative of the 10th District. He wasthe first Member of Congress to represent thenewly created congressional district. He beganhis congressional service as a member of thethen House Post Office and Civil ServiceCommittee and District of Columbia Com-mittee and later became a member of theHouse Ways and Means Committee. Assisting the people he represented was the cornerstone of his service in Congress. Ac-cording to the Almanac of American Politics1972: ``There were few offices that took careof constituents' needs and complaints withmore efficiency.'' The Almanac also describesCongressman Broyhill as a Member of Con-gress that ``should be credited with voting hisconscience'' Congressman Broyhill is a decorated vet- eran and for four years served bravely alongwith thousands of other young American sol-diers in World War II as a captain in the 106thInfantry Division. At the age of 25, CaptainBroyhill fought in one of the most decisive andcostly conflicts of WWII\u00d0the ``Battle of Bulge.''He was taken prisoner and held in a GermanPOW camp until he heroically escaped andwas able to rejoin advancing Allied forces. Congressman Broyhill has dedicated most of his life to serving his country in both a pub-lic and military capacity. His commitment anddevotion to public service is deserving of rec-ognition, and it is appropriate that the postalbuilding at 3409 Lee Highway in Merrifield,Virginia, be renamed in his honor. Congress-man Broyhill is the father of three daughtersand one stepdaughter, and resides today inArlington, Virginia. THELATEHONORABLE JOSEPHL. FISHER Born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, January 11, 1914, the late Congressman Joseph L.Fisher was first elected as the representativeof the 10th District in 1974 as a Democrat andbegan his service in the Ninety-fourth Con-gress. He served for three terms as the sec-ond Member of Congress to represent Vir- ginia's 10th Congressional District. Congressman Fisher held a Ph.D. in Eco- nomics from Harvard University and served asa Senior Economic Advisor on the Council ofEconomic Advisors during the Truman Admin-istration. During his six years in Congress hewas a member of the House Ways and Meansand Budget committees and earned a reputa-tion for his diligent work on taxation, energyand budget policy. He also served as the chairof seven task forces all charged with importantnational policy issues. He held the position of economist at the U.S. Department of State, before serving hiscountry in World War II in the Pacific theaterfrom 1943 to 1946. He was elected to the Ar-lington County Board in 1963 and became anadvocate for regional air, water pollution, andtransit improvement projects. He also servedas chairman of the Washington MetropolitanArea Transit Authority. After his service in Congress, he continued his public service during Virginia GovernorCharles S. Robb's administration as secretaryof human resources for the Commonwealth ofVirginia. He was also a professor of politicaleconomy at George Mason University andchairman of the National Academy of PublicAdministration. He also served as head of theUnitarian Universalist Association, the church'sinternational administrative body. Former Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder once stated, ``Joe proved how well one canserve the people. He did it every day, pushingfor the kinds of things that would truly improvethe quality of life for all of his constituents.'' Congressman Fisher dedicated his life to public service and was a committed advocateof the causes in which he believed. It is fittingto recognize his service and commitment byrenaming the post office located at 3118Washington Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia, intribute to him. Congressman Fisher died in Ar-lington, Virginia, February 19, 1992, and issurvived by his wife Margaret, seven children,16 grandchildren, and two great grandsons. Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor twoformer members for their dedicated publicservice.

Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the deathof Colonel (Retired) Chester Bailey McCoid,United States Army, of Westfield, Connecticut.He was 77. Colonel McCoid, the son of the late Colonel Chester B. McCoid and the late FlorenceAddis, was born on July 31, 1922. He liedabout his age at 16 years old to enter theArmy. By the time he left the service, he hadfought as a combat infantryman in World WarII, Korea and Vietnam. Colonel McCoid wasone of only 294 three-time holders of the pres-tigious Combat Infantry Badge, awarded for di- rect engagement with enemy ground forces ina conflict. During the invasion of Normandy on D-Day in June 1944, Colonel McCoid led a parachuterifle company of the 82nd Airborne Divisionand later refused to stop fighting after beingwounded by an enemy gunner. After fightingin Korea, he was an exchange officer with theUnited States Navy for four years and heserved as a member of the Army GeneralStaff at the Pentagon. In 1966, ColonelMcCoid began serving the first of three toursin Vietnam for a total of 51 months spreadover the next seven years. He was DeputyCommander of the Independent 1st Brigade,101st Airborne Division and commanded the2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (airmobile)while in the Southeast Asia theater. In an un-usual assignment heading the American Ele-ment of The Four Party Military Commission,Region Two, he oversaw the United States' in-terests in negotiations with the representativesof the Communists and South Vietnam to endthe war. Colonel McCoid left for the UnitedStates on March 29, 1973, the last ground sol-dier to serve outside Saigon in the VietnamWar. In his 34 years of dedicated service, Col McCoid received the Distinguished ServiceMedal, the Silver Star, five Legions of Merit,five Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts. Hewas also decorated by France twice and eighttimes by the Republic of Vietnam. He grad-uated from the Naval War College at Newport,Rhode Island, and the Army War College atCarlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania.

I know theMembers of the House will join me in extend-ing heartfelt condolences to his family: his wifeof more than 54 years, Dorothy M. JamisonMcCoid; his two sons, Chester B. McCoid IIIand Scott C. McCoid; his two daughters,Maureen Kennedy and Naomi Litecky; hisbrother and two sisters; and seven grand-children. ON THE RETIREMENT OF JAMES TURNER HON. SAM GEJDENSON OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. GEJDENSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer best wishes to James E. Turner, Jr. onhis retirement as President of General Dynam-ics. Mr. Turner has played a leading role instrengthening American shipbuilding and en-suring that the Navy has the most sophisti-cated technology available to safeguard ournational security. Jim Turner joined General Dynamics in Sep- tember 1988 as Vice President and GeneralManager of Electric Boat, the Company's nu-clear submarine division. He was named Ex-ecutive Vice President of the corporation inFebruary 1991 with responsibility for marine,land systems and services businesses. In ad-dition to these duties, he became President ofElectric Boat in April 1993. In 1995, Mr. Turnerbecame President of General Dynamics. Mr. Turner's retirement will leave a huge void in Navy shipbuilding circles. Throughoutthe industry, few others match Mr. Turner'stechnical expertise, leadership and integrity. His deep understanding of shipbuilding hassignificantly contributed to the fact that thiscountry produces the finest submarines in theworld. In recognition of his contributions, Mr.Turner was elected to the National Academyof Engineering, which honored him for ``* * *leading the implementation of innovative engi-neering and design processes, and estab-lishing a new standard for ship design and ac-quisition.'' he received the Navy League's Ad-miral Chester W. Nimitz Award in 1999. Thisaward honors industry leaders who havemade major contributions to U.S. maritimestrength. Jim Turner was one of the first in the indus- try to recognize that the end of the Cold Warwould require defense-related companies toreorganize in order to remain competitive andsuccessful. Without his insight, technical acu-men and leadership, our country might havelost a vital element of shipbuilding capabilitythat is absolutely essential to meeting our na-tional security needs in the years ahead. Mr. Speaker, the shipbuilding industry will certainly miss Jim Turner's steady presence atthe helm. I know many members join me inthanking Mr. Turner for his many years ofservice to our country. We wish him, and hiswife Elizabeth, the very best in the yearsahead. HONORING RICHARD C. WEBER HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. MCINNIS.

Mr. Speak- er, I rise to commend United Parcel Service(UPS) for earning Forbes Magazine's 1999Company of the Year Award. UPS is an integral part of our nation's econ- omy with 331,000 employees, 610 aircraft,and 157,000 ground vehicles, all used to de-liver three billion parcels and documents each VerDate 27<JAN>2000 04:49 Remarks E27 January 31, 2000 year. As Internet business continues to grow, UPS will become an even more important en-gine of economic development. One of the critical aspects of UPS's success is happy employees. UPS has an employeeretention rate of over 90 percent, and tenurestypically span decades. Many of the UPS ex-ecutives worked their way up from driver orloader jobs. The UPS center in Ontario, California is a big part of the success of UPS, and I want toacknowledge their important contribution tocommerce. As the Congressman for Ontario, Iknow firsthand that the hardworking UPS em-ployees in Ontario deserve recognition fortheir commitment to excellence. UPS, a quality company that takes care of its customers and employees, is poised to de-liver our nation into a high tech economy.Once again, I congratulate UPS on earningthe distinction of Forbes Magazine 1999 Com-pany of the Year. CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN JOHN CHERREY HON. MARGE ROUKEMA OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mrs. ROUKEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con- gratulate U.S. Air Force Captain John A.Cherrey on being chosen for recognition byPresident Clinton at this year's State of theUnion Address, Captain Cherrey, a New Jer-sey native, is one of the most courageous,honorable patriots in the United States militaryand is destined to become a top leader amongthe men and women who put their lives on theline to defend the precious freedoms of thisgreat nation. In a wonderful tradition initiated by President Reagan in 1981, Presidents Reagan, Bushand Clinton have recognized one or moreAmerican heroes each year during their an-nual report to Congress. Captain Cherrey was chosen for that high honor this year because of the extraordinarybravery he exhibited after an F\u00b1117 Stealthfighter was shot down near Novi Sad, Serbia,last March and its American pilot was strand-ed in hostile Serbian territory. CaptainCherrey, flying a single-seat A\u00b110 attack fight-er as combat search and rescue mission com-mander, led five other pilots past Serbianground missiles to locate the pilot, and protecthim until helicopters could arrive and carry himto safety. During the mission, Captain Cherreywas repeatedly targeted by missile installa-tions, threatened by enemy aircraft and had topurposely maneuver into range of the missilesin order to lead the enemy away from thedowned pilot. Despite being critically low onfuel and in danger of being shot down himself,Captain Cherrey remained on the scene untilthe downed pilot was safe. Captain Cherrey's bravery in that incident won him the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest military honor. The captain ``distin-guished himself by gallantry,'' his superiorssaid in the citation accompanying the medal.The 33-year-old father of two ``flew into theteeth of the Serbian air defenses * * * at ex-treme risk to his life * * * with impeccablecourage. * * * By his gallantry and devotion toduty, Captain Cherrey has reflected greatcredit upon himself and the United States Air Force.'' The Silver Star is the crowing achievement in an exemplary military career. CaptainCherrey received the Distinguished FlyingCross for stopping three convoys of armoredvehicles while under fire in western Kosovo,also last year. He has also been awarded theMeritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal (oneoak leaf cluster), the Aerial AchievementMedal (nine oak leaf clusters), the Com-mendation Medal (one oak leaf cluster) andthe Achievement Medal. As a senior pilot with more than 2,250 hours of fighter experience, he has flown more than150 contingency sorties over Korea, Kuwaitand Bosnia, and more than 30 combat sortiesover Serbia and Kosovo. He has served as aflight instructor and test pilot and is currentlyassistant director of operations at the 81stFighter Squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base inGermany. As such, his duties include super-vising the intelligence, weapons and tactics,and mission-planning activities of the AirForce's only A/OA\u00b110 squadron in Europe. In recognition of his achievements, Captain Cherrey has been chosen for promotion to therank of Major next month. Leaders such as Captain Cherrey are trained and nurtured by the military, but thebasis of their leadership ability is rooted intheir families and upbringing. Captain Cherreyis the son of James Cherrey, a teacher, andthe Rev. Heather Cherrey, pastor of St. Paul'sCongregational Church in Nutley. The Rev.Cherrey follows politics, especially foreign af-fairs, closely, and has written to me regularlyon subjects such as deployment of U.S. troopsto Bosnia and Haiti. The Cherrey's clearly in-stilled a sense of patriotism and courage intheir son, whose military accomplishmentshave made them justly proud. Born in Englewood, Captain Cherrey was raised in Dumont and graduated from DumontHigh School. He attended Stevens Institute ofTechnology on an ROTC scholarship, grad-uating with a bachelor's degree in engineeringphysics before starting active duty in 1989. Mr. Speaker, retention of the best and brightest has become a serious problem in themilitary. These highly trained, highly talentedexperts excel in their fields and often love theirmilitary jobs\u00d0yet they know they could pro-vide a more prosperous, more stable life fortheir families in the private sector. National he-roes like Captain Cherrey are no exception. While Captain Cherrey was in Washington for the State of the Union Address, his wife,Lisa, remained behind in Germany with their4-year-old son, Andrew, and 9-month-olddaughter, Jenna. Like many members of themilitary, deployments and temporary duty as-signments have caused Captain Cherrey toendure long separations from his family, a sit-uation particularly painful for those with youngchildren at home. While these separations area fact of military life, we in Congress must doall we can to ensure that military families areprovided with decent housing, schools, serv-ices, and other amenities that help in a smallway to make up for the absence of their lovedones. As John Milton said, ``They also servewho * * * stand and wait.'' Mr. Speaker, we are proud of the men and women of our armed forces and owe them ourfull support. I ask my colleagues in the Houseof Representatives to join me in congratulatingCaptain John Cherrey and in pledging him andhis fellow airmen, sailors, soldiers and marines that support. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. TODD TIAHRT OF KANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, on January 31, I was unavoidably detained and missed roll callvote numbers 2 and 3. Had I been present, Iwould have voted ``yes'' on H. Con. Res. 244,Permitting the Use of the Capitol Rotunda toCommemorate Victims of Hillory J. Farias Date-Rape Prevention Drug Act of 1999. I would re-quest that my statement be placed in the ap-propriate location in the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD. IN MEMORY OF COLONEL CHESTER B. M CCOID of MIDDLETOWN, CT HON. SAM GEJDENSON OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. GEJDENSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Colonel Chester B.McCoid of Middletown, CT. Colonel McCoid,who passed away on January 2, was a trueAmerican Hero, a veteran of three of the cen-tury's largest military conflicts and a patriot ofthe highest order. Colonel McCoid began his 34 year military career by concealing his age to enlist in theArmy in World War II. The Colonel became amember of the fabled 82nd Airborne Divisionand parachuted into Normandy on D-Day.Wounded by ground fire before even exitingthe aircraft, Colonel McCoid neverthelesslanded with his unit and moved to carry out itsmission. Steve Ambrose has recently written atestament to the extraordinary efforts of themen who struggled ashore on Utah andOmaha beaches and parachuted into the Nor-man countryside on June 6, 1944. In assess-ing the success of the Allied campaign on D-Day, Mr. Ambrose concluded that ``. . . in theend success or failure in Operation Overlordcame down to a relatively small number ofjunior officers, noncoms, and privates or sea-men in the American, British, and Canadianarmies, navies, air forces, and coast guards.''Colonel McCoid and other brave young menmade the difference that day and laid thefoundation for defeating the Nazis in Europe. After recovering from his wound, Colonel McCoid returned to active duty and was againwounded in combat. Following the War, he re-ceived a commission in the Army. He went onto serve in Korea and in a number of positionsin the Pentagon before beginning duty in Viet-nam in 1966. Over the next eight years, Colo-nel McCoid would spend fifty-one months onactive duty commanding the 2nd Brigade, 1stCavalry Division and acting as Deputy Com-mander of the Independent 1st Brigade, 101stAirborne Division. Near the end of the Amer-ican involvement in the conflict, ColonelMcCoid headed the American Element of theFour Party Military Commission encompassingthe City of Da Nang and three surrounding VerDate 27<JAN>2000 Remarks E28 January 31, 2000 provinces. In this capacity, he directly partici- pated in negotiating the terms under whichAmerican forces would withdraw. On March29, 1973, Colonel McCoid was the last groundforce soldier outside of Saigon to leave Viet-nam. Colonel McCoid received many decorations and awards during his military career, includ-ing the Distinguished Service Medal, the SilverStar, five Legions of Merit, five Bronze Starsand two Purple Hearts. The Colonel is one ofless than 300 Americans who have beenawarded the Combat Infantry Badge threetimes. This honor is bestowed on Americanservice men and women who have been en-gaged in direct combat with enemy forces. Athough these awards tell us much about the Colonel's bravery and valor, we can learnas much about his character based on an ac-count of a decoration he would not accept. Ac-cording to retired Army Colonel John Collins,Colonel McCoid refused to accept the Distin-guished Service Cross for his actions inSoutheast Asia. Colonel McCoid declined say-ing that he had done much more in World WarII and didn't receive the medal so he didn'tsee why he should receive it later in his ca-reer. Colonel McCoid made a powerful state-ment about honoring veterans who came be-fore\u00d0and later\u00d0by declining to accept anaward he did not believe he had earned. Mr. Speaker, Colonel Chester B. McCoid was an American hero. He answered his na-tion's call to service and distinguished himselfat every turn. He helped to ensure the free-dom of the world and to safeguard the rightswe hold so dear. I extend my sympathy to hisfamily and ask all members to join me in re-membering Colonel McCoid for his extraor-dinary service to our country.

GARY G. MILLER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. GARY MILLER of California.

CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleague J OEPITTSto introduce legisla- tion to officially designate White Clay Creekand its tributaries as part of the National ParkService's National Wild and Scenic RiversSystem. This bill is the culmination of over 30 years of grassroot efforts to bring attention to theunique qualities of White Clay Creek and tobuild consensus to protect its beauty from theadverse consequences of urban sprawl. WhiteClay Creek is located in the densely populatedarea between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania andNewark, Delaware. Eight million people livewithin two hours of the watershed. White Clay Creek is worth protecting. There are 38 properties in the watershed that havebeen listed on the National Register of HistoricPlaces. In addition, the watershed is home tothree endangered plant species and 100 moreplant species of ``special concern'' to the Stateof Delaware. With regard to wildlife, the en-dangered bog turtle is found in the watershedalong with 38 ``rare'' animal species on Dela-ware's list of ``special concern.'' Because thewatershed is located in the middle of the At-lantic Flyway, it is the northern boundary formany southern species of birds and the south-ern boundary for many northern species ofbirds. In total, there are about 200 bird spe-cies in the watershed, including the AmericanBald Eagle. White Clay Creek serves as avital source of drinking water for New CastleCounty, Delaware and Chester County, Penn-sylvania. Finally, White Clay Creek watershedis a popular location for fishing (particularlytrout fishing), hiking, jogging, swimming, bird-watching, horseback riding, skating, sledding,cross-country skiing, photography, and limiteddeer hunting.In September 1999, the National Parks Service released its final report, as ordered byCongress in the 1992 amendments to the Na-tional Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, recom-mending the size and scope of the Wild andScenic designation for White Clay Creek. Thestudy confirmed the beliefs of the citizens liv-ing in the watershed that there was popularsupport for protecting the watershed's natural,historic, and recreational resources. In fact,89% of the landowners surveyed agreed tosupport land use regulations and programs toconserve and protect the watershed. At thesame time a majority believed that there mustbe room for planned residential, commercial,and industrial growth. Therefore, a White Clay Creek Task Force of private landowners, river-related organiza-tions, and all levels of government developedthe White Clay Creek Management Plan todesignate a total of 191 miles, 24 miles asscenic and 167 miles as recreational, of WhiteClay Creek as suitable for the National Wildand Scenic River System. All fifteen of thelocal governments in the watershed, includingthe City of Newark and New Castle County,passed resolutions supporting the manage-ment plan. The designated scenic areas flowthrough the White Clay Creek Preserve, theWhite Clay Creek State Park, and the MiddleRun Natural Area. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this oppor- tunity to describe exactly what it means andwhat it does not mean for White Clay Creekto be designated wild and scenic. This billmeans that the river receives permanent pro-tection from federally-licensed or assistedwater resource projects (dams, diversions,channelization, etc.) that would have a directand adverse effect on its free-flowing conditionor outstanding remarkable resources. It doesnot mean that existing wastewater treatmentplants or potential reservoir sites cannot beexpanded to accommodate carefully plannedresidential, commercial, and industrial growth.New Castle County is actively seeking solu-tions to water shortage problems, and this bill does not limit options that are in the best inter-ests of the citizens of Delaware. The legisla-tion does not open private lands to public ac-cess, nor does it usually affect existing uses ofprivate property. This legislation does not re-place the authority of state, county, and mu-nicipal governments to regulate land use inthe watershed. In fact, there are no federallands within the watershed and this bill doesnot authorize federal funds to be used to pur-chase land. It simply prohibits federal fundsfrom being used to interfere with the free-flow-ing nature of the river or its unique resources.In doing so, it elevates the status of the riverin competing for federal preservation grants.Finally, it mobilizes the states, local govern-ments, and communities in the watershed towork together to preserve this unique, freeflowing river. Mr. Speaker, clearly the combination of White Clay Creek watershed's unique featuresand the strong local support for protecting thewatershed justify its designation as a wild andscenic river. I hope the House ResourcesCommittee will make it a priority to hold hear-ings on this bill. I am confident the Committeewill agree that federal funds should not beused to obstruct the free flow or harm theunique resources of White Clay Creek.

SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an inducteefor the 2000 Colorado Business Hall of Fame,Mr. Allan Phipps. Jointly produced by the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce and Junior Achieve-ment, the Colorado Business Hall of Famerecognizes outstanding Colorado businessesand civic leaders from the past and present,publicizes the contributions of business lead- ers to our community and promotes the impor-tance and value of the private enterprise sys-tem. From their ownership of the Denver Bron-cos to the innovation that has preserved theWinter Park ski area, one cannot look at thehistory of Colorado and not find evidence ofthe Phipps' brothers outstanding accomplish-ments. Allan was born on October 3, 1912, in Den- ver, Colorado. For generations, the Phippsfamily has been important to Colorado. Law-rence Phipps Sr. was a United States Senatorand his wife, Margaret Rogers Phipps, wasthe founder and president of the Denver Sym-phony. Allan loved Denver, but when Congress de- clared war on Japan in 1941, he joined theUnited States Navy. After the war he returnedto Colorado. Allan practiced law. Allan and his brother, Gerald, purchased the Denver Broncos franchise and turned ex-penses into revenue. Their purchase was in-strumental in keep the Broncos in Colorado. Allan was also very active in the community through civic organizations and boards. Heserved on the board of trustees for the DenverMuseum of Natural History, board of man-agers for Columbia Presbyterian-St. Luke Hos-pital, was active on the boards for the DenverSymphony Society, Red Rocks Summer Fes-tival, Williams College, Graland School andClayton College. Sadly, Allan Phipps passed away in 1997. Many people have been inspired by the lead-ership of Allan Phipps and even more have re-spected him. It is with this, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to recognize an inductee of the 2000 ColoradoBusiness Hall of Fame, Mr. Allan Phipps, atruly great businessman and American. COMMENDING MEL WOODS HON. GARY G. MILLER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. GARY MILLER of California. Mr. Speak- er, I rise to commend Mr. Mel Woods for hiswork to improve mental health services forCalifornians.

GERALDPHIPPS HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an inducteefor the 2000 Colorado Business Hall of Fame,Mr. Gerald Phipps. Jointly produced by the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce and Junior Achieve-ment, the Colorado Business Hall of Famerecognizes outstanding Colorado businessesand civic leaders from the past and present,publicizes the contributions of business lead-ers to our community and promotes the impor-tance and value of the private enterprise sys-tem. From their ownership of the Denver Broncos to the innovation that has preserved the Win-ter Park ski area, one cannot look at the his-tory of Colorado and not find evidence of thePhipps' brothers outstanding accomplishmentsand contributions. Gerald Phipps was born on March 4, 1915, in Denver, Colorado. For generations, thePhipps family has been important to Colorado.Lawrence Phipps, Sr. was a United StatesSenator and his wife, Margaret RogersPhipps, was the founder and president of theDenver Symphony. When Congress declared war on Japan in 1941, Gerald joined the United States Navy.After the war he returned to Colorado.Gerald's construction company, Gerald H.Phipps, Inc., built the Boettcher Conservatoryat the Botanic Gardens, the business adminis-tration building and general classroom buildingat the University of Denver, and recently thecompany has begun work on the new DenverBronco football stadium. Gerald and his brother, Allan, purchased the Denver Broncos franchise and turned ex-penses into revenue. Their purchase was in-strumental in keeping the Broncos in Colo-rado. They were also very active in the commu- nity through civic organizations and boards.Gerald was the first and only non-player mem-ber of the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame,president of Gerald H. Phipps, Inc., ColoradoCollege Board of Trustees, Diocese of Colo-rado Board of Trustees and various hospitalprojects throughout Colorado.Sadly, Gerald passed away in August of 1993. Many people have been inspired by theleadership of Gerald Phipps and even morehave respected him. It is with this, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to recognize an inductee of the 2000 ColoradoBusiness Hall of Fame, Mr. Gerald Phipps, atruly great businessman and American. NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY MONTH HON. BRIAN P. BILBRAY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the designation ofJanuary as ``National Biotechnology Month.'' Today, Americans are living longer and healthier lives, thanks in part to modern medi-cine. Death rates from heart disease, cancer,and stroke are going down, and hundreds ofnew medicines are being developed to combatdiseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,and arthritis. Biotechnology not only creates new medi- cines and treatments, but it also improves thelivelihood of individuals and our community atlarge. More than 212,000 Californians are em-ployed due to biomedical research and devel-opment, earning an average salary of$64,000. They are developing products thatgenerate more than $4.2 billion in exports. InSan Diego, the University of California at SanDiego, Scripps Research Institute, and theSalk Institute lend their expertise to and par-ticipate in a biotechnology cluster of over27,000 jobs. In addition, San Diego County isprivileged to have hundreds of small start-upbiotech companies producing innovative andlife-saving drugs, biologics and devices. Mr. Speaker, as a follow-up to a CALBIO Summit meeting in which Congressman B URR and I participated this past fall, I followed upwith many of the biotechnology companiesthat are members of BIOCOM, San Diego.What I learned from these technology leadersis that Congress must work to assist thesecompanies and enable them to produce theselife-saving drugs and devices, while not hin-dering their growth and innovation. For example, every company that I met with expressed their frustration with the lack of sta-bility in securing reimbursement from theHealth Care Financing Administration (HCFA).Not only do these companies have to worktheir way through the FDA approval process,but after they toil for years and finally receiveFDA approval, they then have to begin anoften arduous fight with HCFA to receive ade-quate reimbursement for their products. Mr.Speaker, I have had companies in my districtdissolve because they have lost the battle withHCFA, after receiving approval for their prod-ucts from the FDA. We must address this seri-ous issue and develop a solution to ensurethat these companies do not become finan-cially insolvent as a result of bureaucraticdelay. While this is a serious problem faced by the biotech industry, we must also praise theirhard work and innovation, which improves allof our lives and the community at large. I com-mend the biotechnology industry and the VerDate 27<JAN>2000 04:58 Remarks E31 January 31, 2000 many companies in California and San Diego that are producing innovative and life-savingdrugs and devices. I urge my colleagues tolend their support and appreciation to this cru-cial and resourceful industry. A TRIBUTE TO DEACONESS ROSA A.

MARK UDALL OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Erin Breeze, one of my con-stituents from Nederland, Colorado who wasone of twelve Americans selected as an inau-gural George J. Mitchell Scholar.Erin was selected from more than 250 appli- cants in a nationwide competition to pursueone year of post-graduate study at a universityin Ireland or Northern Ireland. The scholarshipis named in honor of former Senator GeorgeMitchell's contribution to the Northern Irelandpeace process and is awarded to individualswho have shown academic distinction, com-mitment to service and potential for leader-ship. Indeed, Erin has rose to the occasion.Erin will graduate in May with a degree inInternational Affairs from the University of Col-orado. She is a Dean's Scholar, recipient of aservice learning scholarship and member ofnumerous honor societies. Erin spent a year as a volunteer for AmeriCorps, where she completed 1800 hoursof service in the areas of education, environ-ment, and public safety. While tutoring firstand second grade students in San Diego, CA,Erin also assisted the school district in assess-ing the needs and conditions of primary andsecondary schools. Additionally, after becom-ing a certified wildland firefighter, she helpeddevelop a community education project withthe Flagstaff Fire Department in Flagstaff, AZand provided disaster relief to residents inLama, NM following a forest fire.

ErinBreeze is one of those promising individualswho is making a difference both in her localcommunity and the global community. Be-cause of her unswerving dedication and talent,I have no doubt that Erin will be a future worldleader for peace. NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY MONTH HON. JAMES C. GREENWOOD OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. GREENWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of myself and RepresentativeC LIFFSTEARNSto recognize January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month. It is fitting that in the first month of this new year, at the start of a new century, we look tobiotechnology as our greatest hope for the fu-ture. Mapping the human genome, for example, is ahead of schedule and nearly complete.That achievement, begun 10 years ago, will VerDate 27<JAN>2000 04:58 Remarks E32 January 31, 2000 rank as one of the most significant advances in health care by accelerating the bio-technology industry's discovery of new thera-pies and cures for our most life-threateningdiseases. Biotechnology not only is using genetic re- search to create new medicines, but also toimprove agriculture, industrial manufacturingand environmental management. The United States leads the world in bio- technology innovation. There are approxi-mately 1,300 biotech companies in the UnitedStates, employing more than 150,000 people.The industry spent nearly $10 billion on re-search and development in 1998. Althoughrevenues totaled $18.4 billion, the industry re-corded a net loss of $5 billion because of theexpensive nature of drug development. In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis- tration (FDA) approved more than 20 bio-technology drugs, vaccines and new indica-tions for existing medicines, pushing the num-ber of marketed biotech drugs and vaccines tomore than 90. Total FDA biotech approvalsfrom 1982 through 1999 reach more than 140when adding clearances for new indications ofexisting medicines. The vast majority of newbiotech drugs were approved in the secondhalf of the 1990s, demonstrating the bio-technology industry's surging proficiency atfinding new medicines to treat our most life-threatening illnesses. Biotechnology is revolutionizing every facet of medicine from diagnosis to treatment of alldiseases. It is detailing life at the molecularlevel and someday will take much of theguesswork out of disease management andtreatment. The implications for health care areas great as any milestone in medical history.We expect to see great strides early in thiscentury. A devastating disease that has stolen many of our loved ones, neighbors and friends iscancer. Biotechnology already has made sig-nificant strides in battling certain cancers. Thisis only the beginning. The first biotechnology cancer medicines have been used with surgery, chemotherapyand radiation to enhance their effectiveness,lessen adverse effects and reduce chances ofcancer recurrence. Newer biotech cancer drugs target the un- derlying molecular causes of the disease.Biotech cancer treatments under development,such as vaccines that prevent abnormal cellgrowth, may make traditional treatments obso-lete. In addition, gene therapy is being studiedas a way to battle cancer by starving tumorcells to death. Many biotech drugs are designed to treat our most devastating and intractable illnesses.In many cases these medicines are the firstever therapies for those diseases. For exam-ple, advancements in research have yieldedfirst-of-a-kind drugs to treat multiple sclerosisand rheumatoid arthritis as well as cancer. Other medicines in clinical trials block the start of the molecular cascade that triggers in-flammation's tissue damaging effects in nu-merous disease states. In diseases, such asAlzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's,clinical trials are under way to test a variety ofcell therapies that generate healthy neurons toreplace deteriorated ones. Recent break-throughs in stem cell research have promptedexperts to predict cures within 10 years forsome diseases, such as Type I (Juvenile) Dia-betes and Parkinson's.With more than 350 biotechnology medi- cines in late-stage clinical trials for illnesses,such as heart ailments, cancer, neurologicaldiseases and infections, biotechnology innova-tion will be the foundation not only for improv-ing our health and quality of life, but also low-ering health care costs. In the past two years Congress has in- creased funding for the National Institutes ofHealth's basic research programs by 15 per-cent per year. We are 40 percent of the waytoward doubling the NIH budget. Health-careresearch, however, is not one-sided. The pub-lic funds we provide are for basic research.The private sector takes this basic scienceand then spends many times more than whatthe government has contributed to create newdrugs and get them to patients. In today'sworld, biotechnology companies are amongthe greatest innovators and risk takers. Biotechnology also is being used to improve agriculture, industrial manufacturing and envi-ronmental management. In manufacturing, theemphasis has shifted from the removal of toxicchemicals in production waste streams to re-placement of those pollutants with biologicalprocesses that prevent the environment frombeing fouled. And because these biologicalprocesses are derived from renewablesources they also conserve traditional energyresources. Industrial biotechnology companiesare the innovators commercializing clean tech-nologies and their progress is accelerating atan astonishing rate. In agricultural biotechnology, crops on the market have been modified to protect themfrom insect damage thus reducing pesticideuse. Biotech crops that are herbicide tolerantenable farmers to control weeds without dam-aging the crops. This allows farmers flexibilityin weed management and promotes conserva-tion tillage. Other biotech crops are protectedagainst viral diseases with the plant equivalentof a vaccine. Biotech fruits and vegetables aretastier and firmer and remain fresher longer. The number of acres worldwide planted with biotech crops soared from 4.3 million in 1996to 100 million in 1999, of which 81 millionacres were planted in the United States andCanada. Acceptance of these crops by farm-ers is one indication of the benefits they havefor reducing farming costs and use of pes-ticides while increasing crop yields. Biotech crops in development include foods that will offer increased levels of nutrients andvitamins. Benefits range from helping devel-oping nations meet basic dietary requirementsto creating disease-fighting and health-pro-moting foods. Biotechnology is improving the lives of those in the U.S. and abroad. The designation ofJanuary 2000 as National BiotechnologyMonth is an indication to our constituents andtheir children that Congress recognizes thevalue and the promise of this technology. Bio-technology is a big word that means hope. A MODEL OF COMMUNITY SERVICE FROM SOUTHWEST MISSOURI HON. ROY BLUNT OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend a resident of the Seventh Congres-sional District of Missouri who can teach all of us something about commitment. Jerry L.Sumners Sr. has touched his community inAurora, Missouri. His philanthropy and visionhave given new and expanded opportunities tohis community to grow and develop servicesand facilities that have benefited kids, the en-vironment and the city's business climate. Jerry Sumner's full time job is running Serv- ice Vending Company, a multi-state enterprisewith 50 employees. The firm specializes in thesale of gumballs, treats and toys from coin-op-erated dispensers found in most supermarketsand convenience stores. The company thatearns two-bits a sale, has given Jerry the abil-ity to be a civic dynamo\u00d0a role he takes veryseriously. He may be Aurora, Missouri's great-est cheerleader. Jerry Sumners has unself-ishly given his time, energy and support to hiscommunity. Jerry's approach to business and life is sim- ple and direct. ``Be organized, do things thesame way all the time; get the facts; don't tellme the problem, give me the solution.'' Jerry, an avid pilot, understood the need for expanding the city's airport. In 1999 he do-nated $100,000 to the Aurora Airport to extendthe present runway. That same year he pro-vided a major gift to build a concession standat Aurora's Baldwin Park with an additional giftto add dressing rooms for the baseball playersto be completed by 2002. Between 1990 and 1998, it was Jerry Sum- ners who contributed at least $180,000 to ex-pand the Little League program from onebaseball field to four. Jerry Sumners annuallysponsors various baseball, basketball, softballand soccer squads. Jerry has given significantdonations to the Aurora Main Street programto modernize the look of the business commu-nity and was a major supporter of the city'sChristmas lights project. Jerry Sumners hassponsored the annual Applefest pageant inMarionville the last two years and is a leadingsponsor in the annual 4th of July fireworks inAurora. When a local youth sports team wants to compete on the road, Jerry makes sure theyhave the resources to go. He also contributedto the new band building at Southwest Mis-souri State University and to improvements atthe Wilson's Creek National Battlefield nearSpringfield. Jerry's company has prospered in the small town setting. His family of four sons and twodaughters have gone to school and grown upin Aurora. Jerry and wife, Theresa, are bothactive in the community and live on a 300acre farm where they raise cattle. In short, if it has something to do with im- proving the community of Aurora or adding tothe quality of life, chances are that Jerry Sum-ners has taken an active role in it. He hasearned the title of ``community leader.'' Saturday, January 29, the Aurora Chamber of Commerce gave Jerry L. Sumners Sr. theirhighest honor\u00d0``The Community ServiceAward''\u00d0in recognition of his contributions toimprove the community. Jerry, who turned 65on January 27, has no plans to either slowdown or end his commitment to the bettermentof his community. I know my colleagues in the House join with me in honoring him for his dedication and hiscommitment to his community, neighbors andhis friends.

IKE SKELTON OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a long and exceptionally dis-tinguished civil service career has come to anend. Mr. Dale T. Pollard, of my hometown ofLexington, Missouri, recently retired after 58years of extraordinary service to the Lake CityArmy Ammunition Plant. Mr. Pollard's career began nearly 60 years ago as an Assistant Chief Factory Clerk atRemington Arms Company, Incorporated. Hewillingly left the ammunition plant to enlist inthe Army during World War II and saw combatin the European Theater, earning the combatinfantrymen badge and the Bronze Star forvalor. He immediately returned to the plant atthe end of the war and dedicated himself togovernment service for the next five decades.Mr. Pollard served in many capacities at theplant, always determined to ensure that Sol-diers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines were sup-plied with the highest quality ammunition andthat Americans were receiving every penny'sworth of their defense dollar. At 81 years old, Mr. Pollard could have re- tired many years ago. Instead, he remained infederal service because he loved his work andwas committed to Lake City, the OrdnanceCorps, and the U.S. Army. Mr. Speaker, Dale Pollard has been an in- spiration to all who had the pleasure of work-ing with him at Lake City. I know all Members of Congress will join me in paying tribute tothe outstanding public service of my goodfriend. TRIBUTE TO NORMA RIVERA HON. JOSE\u00c2 E. SERRANO OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Norma Rivera, an out-standing individual who has dedicated 48years of her life to community service, and towish her a happy retirement. Born on June 1, 1935, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Mrs. Rivera moved to Buffalo and grad-uated from high school in 1952. In 1953 shemoved to the Bronx where she has been livingsince. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Rivera worked in a fac- tory for three years before joining a housingcourt agency that was located on Park Avenuein the Bronx. She worked at that agency foreight years. In 1964 she left the housing courtagency to work as a counselor and a programcoordinator at Sport's for the People, a medi-cally supervised outpatient program. In 1984she was employed by Lincoln Hospital workingin medical records until her retirement in De-cember of last year. Norma is also the Presi-dent of People's Voice Democratic Club in theBronx. Mrs. Rivera is the proud mother of six, Vic- tor, Debbie, Jacqueline, Manuel, Jeanette, andFrances and grandmother of twelve, Lisette,Angie, Kennedy, Michael, Alexis, Matthew,Charles, Denise, Samantha, Brittany, NormaLuz, and Francine. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. Norma Rivera for her en-during commitment to the community, and inwishing her a happy retirement. HONORING ETHEL McALPINE JAMESON HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to pause and remember awoman that many knew and loved, Mrs. EthelMcAlpine Jameson. Mrs. Jameson was a long-time Republican Party activist and a very politically involvedperson. Mrs. Jameson was co-chair of theelection campaigns for a former United StatesRepresentative and Senator. She served onthe board of the Tri-County Mental Health As-sociation in the Denver area and was also ac-tive in musical circles and the EpiscopalChurch. Mrs. Jameson is survived by her son, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. It is with this, Mr. Speaker, that I wish to re- member Mrs. Jameson for being a great activ-ist and caring wife, mother and grandmother.She was a great American whose service andfriendship will be greatly missed. VerDate 27<JAN>2000 04:58 E34 January 31, 2000 HONORING CHAIRMAN TOM BLILEY HON. HOWARD COBLE OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, in just a few days\u00d0February 8, to be exact\u00d0we will ac-knowledge the fourth anniversary of the sign-ing of the historic Telecommunications Act of1996. And so, it is fitting that we acknowledgeone of the act's key sponsors, my good friend,the gentleman from Richmond, Chairman T OM BLILEY. As part of the act's anniversary activities, the Competitive Telecommunications Associa-tion, more easily referred to as CompTel, ishonoring Chairman B LILEYas one of the two ``Champions of Competition,'' the other beingSenator F RITZHOLLINGS from the State of North Carolina. Both will be duly recognized,and rightly so, for their outstanding leadershipand bipartisan spirit throughout the nearly dec-ade-long debate in the Congress to update the1934 act. Mr. Speaker, the Telecom Act provides for a procompetitive, deregulatory national policyframework designed to accelerate rapid pri-vate sector deployment of advanced tele-communications and information technologiesand services to all Americans by opening alltelecommunications markets to competition. Well, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that the results are in following 4 years after enact-ment of this historic piece of legislation.Thanks to Chairman B LILEY's persistence in crafting proper safeguards to ensure opencompetition to all players, we see today thefruits of his labor. Finally, Mr. Speaker, in addition to com- mending Mr. B LILEYfor his role in bringing competition to the local market, I would notethat his good work on this historic bill hasbrought hundreds of new companies com-peting in today's marketplace offering betterproducts and services than have ever beendeveloped and deployed in our lifetime. Withthat said, it's important to note that not onlyare consumers better served with manychoices, but served at lower prices. Mr. B LILEY and the act intended this to happen. Mr.Speaker, I raise my hat to Chairman T OMBLI- LEYand congratulate him on being named the Champion of Competition. IN HONOR OF HAZEL WOLF HON. JAY INSLEE OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of an exceptional environmentaland social activist who recently passed, Ms.Hazel Wolf. Ms. Wolf, originally from Victoria,British Columbia, spent most of her life in Se-attle, and her final years in Port Angeles. Onedaughter, five grandchildren, five great-grand-children, and four great-great grandchildrensurvive her. Ms. Wolf's commitment to the environment was strong throughout her 101 years. As anactive member of the Audubon Society for 38years, she helped to establish Audubon chap-ters within Washington State, recruit newmembers, and fought tirelessly to protect our natural resources. The Hazel Wolf Wetlandson Sammamish Plateau was named in her be-half. She was also the recipient of a numberof other conservation awards, including theAudubon Medal for Excellence in Environ-mental Achievement in 1977, the WashingtonState Department of Game's Award for serv-ices in protection of wildlife in 1978, and theState of Washington Environmental ExcellenceAward in 1978, and the Seattle's Spirit ofAmerica Award in 1999. Many in my commu-nity cheered heartily when, on her 98th birth-day, Washington State Governor Mike Lowrydeclared March 10th as ``Hazel Wolf Day.''She understood clearly that if we do not actnow to safeguard our precious resources, wewill be responsible for the destruction of irre-placeable wilderness areas and wildlife com-munities. She was also committed to the idea of women's suffrage, social justice, and civilrights, and never hesitated to practice whatshe preached. Many years ago, during the erain which many public places were segregated,Ms. Wolf asked to swim specifically when theYWCA pool was set aside for African-Amer-ican women. Her swim spoke volumes abouther beliefs. Mr. Speaker, the recent death of Hazel Wolf has made me realize, once again, what anawesome responsibility we have as Membersof Congress. Ms. Wolf's fight to protect therights of the working poor, religious and ethnicminorities, and our natural resources is a fightthat I am proud to carry forth as a UnitedStates Congressman. I know the thoughts andprayers of many of us in the Seattle area goout to Ms. Wolf's entire family. Her life was ashining example of devotion, in so many ways,to a better world for all of us. SOUTH FLORIDA FOOD RECOVERY; FEEDING THE POOR, NEEDY ANDHOMELESS HON. CARRIE P. MEEK OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mrs. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, South Florida Food Recovery recently completed itseighth ``Toys for Tots'' program, in cooperationwith the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve andsponsored by the city of North Miami Beach.This effort was an enormous success, helpingmake the holidays brighter for more than5,000 children. Our entire community appreciates the efforts of the hundreds of contributors, sponsors, andvolunteers. I want to particularly recognize theefforts of South Florida Food Recovery'sfounder, the Honorable Jule Littman, who hasserved the city of North Miami Beach with dis-tinction in many official capacities and whocontinues to dedicate his efforts to helping theneediest people in our community. Congratula-tions to him and to his entire staff for anotherjob well done. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with my colleagues an article on this matter that ap-peared in the Community Newspapers ofMiami. I hope it will inspire more communitiesto follow the example set by South FloridaFood Recover.[From the Community Newspaper, Dec. 27, 1999] SFFR J OINS MARINES TOBRING HOLIDAY CHEER TO NEEDY KIDS (By Bari Auerbach) More than 20,000 toys and 7,000 leather sneakers were distributed recently to needychildren during the eighth annual ``Toys forTots'' giveaway hosted by South FloridaFood Recovery (SFFR) and the U.S. MarineCorps at Patricia A. Mishcon Park in NorthMiami Beach. Santa Claus (alias Bill Lindsay, a SFFR volunteer) helped distribute toys to at least5,000 children from all over Miami-DadeCounty. The toys were donated by many cor-porations and members of the community. In addition to pony and railroad car rides, there were special treats for hungry appe-tites including 10,000 slices of pizza donatedby Papa John's, 5,000 hot dogs served by suchcivic organizations as the North MiamiBeach Kiwanis Club and the North Bay Vil-lage Optimist Club, plus cake, ice cream,cookies, milk in mugs, soda, candy andmore. The North Miami Pops Orchestra played holiday classics, plus favorite characterslike Burnie, the Miami Heat mascot, and apurple dinosaur mingled with the childrenwhile BellSouth Mobility offered free calls tosend holiday greetings anywhere in the U.S. ``This year's Toys for Tots event was big- ger and better than ever, thanks to the gen-erous support of many sponsors,'' said JuleLittman, executive director of South FloridaFood Recovery. ``Special thanks goes out to the City of North Miami Beach, City of North Miami,City of Miami, United Way of Miami-Dade,McArthur Dairy, Publix: Orchestra, North MiamiBeach Kiwanis and Feed the Children.'' The concept for South Florida Food Recov- ery originated about 20 years ago when atruckload of cheese was inherited by theCity of North Miami Beach and Littman ar-ranged to have the cheese distributed to theneedy. ``Much to everyone's surprise, there were many men, women and families with smallchildren who lined the street for the freecheese giveaway,'' Littman said. Once the need was recognized, Littman, along with civic minded volunteers and foodadministering agencies, started their mis-sion to feed the poor, needy and homeless bybringing together food items and suppliesfrom a variety of industries. Today, South Florida Food Recovery, a non-profit organization, recovers and distrib-utes food, free of charge, without discrimina-tion to needy people in Florida on a regularbasis and to disaster zones in times of emer-gency. To inquire about volunteering for future SFFR events or to donate items, phone 305\u00b1891\u00b18811. REMEMBERING A LIBRARY VISIONARY, FRANK BARKMAN HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask that we pause for a moment to rememberthe life of a great advocate for the City ofPueblo, Mr. Frank Barkman. Mr. Barkman and his wife, Marie Lamb Barkman, have been financial and personal VerDate 27<JAN>2000 04:58 E35 January 31, 2000 pillars of the Pueblo Library District. They do- nated funds to construct several libraries, in-cluding the Frank I. Lamb Branch and theFrank and Marie Barkman Branch. Frank and Marie were the leading advo- cates for Pueblo's library system over theyears and were active in the community inmany other ways. Mr. Barkman served as thePresident of the Library Board for more thantwelve years. He was also active in Rotaryand was a supporter of the YMCA and the ElPueblo Boys Ranch. It is with this, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to pay tribute to a man that has given somuch to his community. The City of Pueblowill miss his friendship, leadership and serv-ice. THE EVIL PEN HON. JACK METCALF OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. METCALF. Mr. Speaker, I submit for the RECORDthe following article: THEEVILPEN (By Balint Vazsonyi) [First published August 31, 1999, in The Washington Times, under the title ``Guid-ing the pen.''] On August 23, Frank J. Murray presented an exhaustive special report in the Wash-ington Times on the subject of executive or-ders. Early on, he quotes Paul Begala, 5-stargeneral in President Clinton's personalarmy. ``Stroke of the pen, of the land.Kind of cool,'' says Mr. Begala. Indeed.During the early 1980's, on a concert tour of Hungary, I found myself commenting to afriend about the general easing of the polit-ical atmosphere, plenty of food, people say-ing more frequently what they reallythought\u00d0all in stark contrast to other colo-nies of the Soviet Socialist Russian Empire,such as East Germany or Czechoslovakia. ``Don't be fooled,'' my friend retorted, ``the pen that can wipe out a man's very existenceis still there. Right now, the pen is held bya more decent hand, that's all.'' One of the many ways of defining funda- mental differences between socialism andAmerica is to point out that the U.S. Con-stitution does not provide such a pen to anyindividual. Nevertheless, Mr. Murray's research shows generous use of just such a pen by all recentpresidents. While Presidents Kennedy andCarter hold a comfortable lead, PresidentFord is not far behind, and Bill Clinton's av-erage falls between those of PresidentsReagan and Bush. So why the sudden concern?Because the pen is now held by a hand that is unrestrained by any of the considerationswhich informed and guided American presi-dents since George Washington. The hand isattached to a body whose heart, brain, andother parts have made mockery of the oaththe mouth had recited\u00d0not once but twice\u00d0before taking office. A review of executive orders currently in force cannot fail to alarm the most placidand trusting soul among us. ``They include,''writes Mr. Murray, ``vast powers to seizeproperty, commodities, fuel and minerals;organize and control the means of produc-tion, including compulsory job assignmentsfor civilians; assign military forces abroad;institute martial law and force civilian relo-cation; seize and control all forms of trans- portation and restrict travel; seize commu-nications and health facilities; regulate op-eration of private enterprise; require na-tional registration through the postal serv-ice, or otherwise control citizens' lives.'' True\u00d0many of these were first issued by others and only confirmed, renewed and con-solidated by Mr. Clinton. But the end resultis that, for all practical intents and pur-poses, Mr. Clinton can declare himself dic-tator of America with yet another stroke ofthe pen. He can choose to do so at, say, 3:00a.m. so that we wake up to a country ofwhich we are not longer citizens, but pris-oners. The reality, of course, is that no sane per- son would have thought past presidents\u00d0such as Carter, Reagan or Bush\u00d0capable ofimposing their personal rule upon the UnitedStates of America. But it is also a reality that no sane person could think Mr. and Mrs. Clinton incapableof imposing their personal rule upon theUnited States of America. No one before presumed to say that the American people cannot be trusted to makeproper use of the money they had earned. No one before has placed an ever-growing circle of fortifications between the Peopleand the People's House. No one before has populated an entire ad- ministration with purely political ap-pointees. Unlike the age-old system of pa-tronage, as practiced by both major parties,a cadre of operatives now runs the executivebranch. Their primary qualification is thecontempt they share with the presidentialpair\u00d0contempt for the American People andtheir Constitution. Previous administrationsexpected loyalty. The present one requiresobedience, even from legislators. The practice of giving police powers to one citizen over another is an import from theworst regimes in this, or any other, century.In a heartbeat, it can turn decent, ordinaryAmericans into commissars. All of the above is happening because we are letting it happen. Congress lets it hap-pen. The courts let it happen. The Foundersknew better. Yet many in our midst will recite the mantra according to which ``a lot of time haspassed since the Founding . . .'' ``They didn'teven have electric light, knew nothing aboutmoon shots\u00d0how could they have foreseenthe world for which they were providingguidance . . .'' ``We must treat the Constitu-tion document andchange it as needed . . .``'' But the miracle of the American Founding was precisely that they knew. Without elec-tricity, without computers and space flights,they knew. They wrote provisions so one per-son could not dictate. They made certainAmerica's future would not depend onwhether ``the hand'' was decent or not. Theyhad seen how quickly rulers become cor-rupted. They knew the mortal danger of the evil pen. Apparantly, we don't. A TRIBUTE TO OFFICER JAMES DRESS HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, during our recent recess, a constituent of mine performed anheroic act which saved the life of a fellow lawenforcement officer and earning him a placeas one of the genuine heroes of our Hudson Valley region. James Dress of Tappan, NY, is a rookie of- ficer of the 49th Precinct in New York City,and is also chief of the South OrangetownAmbulance Corps in my Congressional Dis-trict. Two days before New Year's Day, OfficerDress arrived at the scene of a shooting inwhich an undercover detective was seriouslywounded. Utilizing his experience as an EMT,Officer Dress realized that the wound was tooserious to await an ambulance. He and a fel-low officer performed emergency procedureson the undercover policeman and rushed himthemselves to Jacobi Medical Center, wherehe was admitted in critical condition with ex-tensive internal injuries. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in congratulating Officer Dress and I ampleased to insert into the R ECORDat this point a profile on Officer James Dress, which ap-peared in the ``Our Town'' newspaper soonafter his act of [From Our Town, Jan. 5, 2000] A ``H ERO'' LABEL 12 Y EARS IN THE MAKING (By Arthur R. Aldrich) Not every NYC rookie cop gets the ``hero'' label pinned on him after only a few monthson the job. Some complete their careersquietly doing their jobs with little publicrecognition. But when the moment came foraction, James Dress of Tappan was prepared.He had been preparing since 1987. Dress is chief of the S. Orangetown Ambu- lance Corps, elected to his third term as headof the unit. He joined the corps in 1987 whilestill at Tappan Zee High School, learningfirst aid riding the rigs as a youth corpsmember. While still at TZ, Dress took andpassed the 120-hour EMT certification courseto qualify as a full-fledged corps member. Even while he completed his college work at SUNY Oneonta, Dress returned to Tappanand rode the rigs as often as he could. AtOneonta, he was among the founders of thestudent Medical Response Team, usuallyfirst on the scene at campus emergencies,and trained to administer first aid. ``I was looking at corporate law for a ca- reer,'' Dress concedes. But at Oneonta heswitched his major from political science tobusiness economics and marketing. But under all his other career ambitions was lurking a desire for law enforcement. ``Itook the tests in Rockland for police offi-cer,'' Dress says, ``and came in as a finalistfor appointment in Orangetown.'' All thewhile he continued to volunteer as an EMTand answer calls with the S. OrangetownCorps. But Orangetown never appointed Dress; in- stead, he took the New York City Policeexams, qualified, and was graduated from thePolice Academy in April, 1999. Instead of landing in a corporate law of- fice, Dress found himself on the streets ofthe Bronx, a rookie assigned to the 4\u00b19 Pre-cinct in Baychester. His unit concentrateson quality of life crimes; but of course, per-forms all other police duties as well. Assigned to the 5:30 p.m. to 2:05 a.m. pa- trol, Dress was riding with his sergeant, EdWarren, in a patrol car at 12:35 a.m. onWednesday, December 29, when he respondedto a call of a shooting. Pulling up at E. GunHill Road and Sexton Place, the officers dis-covered a man lying on the sidewalk and asmall crowd. According to Dress, he determined the man on the sidewalk had been shot in the stom-ach. Others in the crowd had also been in-jured by gun shots, but less seriously. ``I put in a rush call for an ambulance,'' Dress says, ``and began first aid.'' But when VerDate Remarks E36 January 31, 2000 Dress realized how serious the injury was, he made the decision to put the wounded manin the patrol car and take him to JacobiMedical Center, a few minutes away. ``We could have waited for the ambulance,'' Dress says, ``but we didn't know how, long itwould take, and where it would have to comefrom.'' Dress' evaluation of the situation and prompt administration of appropriate firstaid is credited for saving the man's life. Only later did Dress and the other officers learn that the wounded man was an under-cover NYC police officer. The investigationinto the shooting is continuing. As an EMT, Dress' first obligation is al- ways to treat the patient. As a police officer,Dress also had to obligation to try to get in-formation from the shooting victim while hewas treating him. ``He was trying to give me a name,'' Dress says, ``but he was in a lot of pain.'' AtJacobi, doctors determined that the bullethad pierced the undercover officer's heartand had lodged near his spine. On Saturday, Dress and other officers vis- ited the wounded man, still in intensive care,whose name is not being released because heis an undercover policeman. ``He seemed to be improving; he shook hands with me. His wife and children werethere, too. His two year-old son also huggedme and thanked me.'' The wounded officer isnow reported to have regained some feelingin his legs, leading to hope for a more com-plete recovery. Dress is the first to disclaim the hero label. ``I did what I was trained to do. Anypolice officer would have done the samething; we're all trained in first aid. I thinkwas EMT experience made the difference inevaluating the situation.'' Dress is back on duty, having been given New Year's Eve off at the discretion of hisunit commander. And he still spends his daysoff working at the S. Orangetown ambulanceheadquarters, and riding the rig when need-ed. His hope for the new year? That the man whose life he helped save makes a full andcomplete recovery. NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY MONTH HON. CALVIN M. DOOLEY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. DOOLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of myself and Mr. G REEN- WOODof Pennsylvania, Mr. B URRof North Carolina, Ms. D UNNof Washington, and Mr. TANNERof Tennessee to recognize January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month. It is fitting that in the first month of this new year, at the start of a new century, we look tobiotechnology as our greatest hope for the fu-ture. Mapping the human genome, for example, is ahead of schedule and nearly complete.That achievement, begun 10 years ago, willrank as one of the most significant advancesin health care by accelerating the bio-technology industry's discovery of new thera-pies and cures for our most life-threateningdiseases. Biotechnology not only is using genetic re- search to create new medicines, but also toimprove agriculture, industrial manufacturingand environmental management.The United States leads the world in bio- technology innovation. There are approxi-mately 1,300 biotech companies in the UnitedStates, employing more than 150,000 people.The industry spent nearly $10 billion on re-search and development in 1998. Althoughrevenues totaled $18.4 billion, the industry re-corded a net loss of $5 billion because of theexpensive nature of drug development. In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis- tration (FDA) approved more than 20 bio-technology drugs, vaccines and new indica-tions for existing medicines, pushing the num-ber of marketed biotech drugs and vaccines tomore than 90. Total FDA biotech approvalsfrom 1982 through 1999 reach more than 140when adding clearances for new indications ofexisting medicines. The vast majority of newbiotech drugs were approved in the secondhalf of the 1990s, demonstrating the bio-technology industry's surging proficiency atfinding new medicines to treat our most life-threatening illnesses. Biotechnology is revolutionizing every facet of medicine from diagnosis to treatment of alldiseases. It is detailing life at the molecularlevel and someday will take much of theguesswork out of disease management andtreatment. The implications for health care areas great as any milestone in medical history.We expect to see great strides early in thiscentury. A devastating disease that has stolen many of our loved ones, neighbors and friends iscancer. Biotechnology already has made sig-nificant strides in battling certain cancers. Thisis only the beginning. The first biotechnology cancer medicines have been used with surgery, chemotherapyand radiation to enhance their effectiveness,lessen adverse effects and reduce chances ofcancer recurrence. Newer biotech cancer drugs target the un- derlying molecular causes of the disease.Biotech cancer treatments under development,such as vaccines that prevent abnormal cellgrowth, may make traditional treatments obso-lete. In addition, gene therapy is being studiedas a way to battle cancer by starving tumorcells to death. Many biotech drugs are designed to treat our most devastating and intractable illnesses.In many cases these medicines are the firstever therapies for those diseases. For exam-ple, advancements in research have yieldedfirst-of-a-kind drugs to treat multiple sclerosisand rheumatoid arthritis as well as cancer. Other medicines in clinical trials block the start of the molecular cascade that triggers in-flammation's tissue damaging effects in nu-merous disease states. In diseases, such asAlzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's,clinical trials are under way to test a variety ofcell therapies that generate healthy neurons toreplace deteriorated ones. Recent break-throughs in stem cell research have promptedexperts to predict cures within 10 years forsome diseases, such as Type I (Juvenile) Dia-betes and Parkinson's. With more than 350 biotechnology medi- cines in late-stage clinical trials for illnesses,such as heart ailments, cancer, neurologicaldiseases and infections, biotechnology innova-tion will be the foundation not only for improv-ing our health and quality of life, but also low-ering health care costs. In the past two years Congress has in- creased funding for the National Institutes ofHealth's basic research programs by 15 per- cent per year. We are 40 percent of the waytoward doubling the NIH budget. Health-careresearch, however, is not one-sided. The pub-lic funds we provide are for basic research.The private sector takes this basic scienceand then spends many times more than whatthe government has contributed to create newdrugs and get them to patients. In today'sworld, biotechnology companies are amongthe greatest innovators and risk takers. Biotechnology also is being used to improve agriculture, industrial manufacturing and envi-ronmental management. In manufacturing, theemphasis has shifted from the removal of toxicchemicals in production waste streams to re- placement of those pollutants with biologicalprocesses that prevent the environment frombeing fouled. And because these biologicalprocesses are derived from renewablesources they also conserve traditional energyresources. Industrial biotechnology companiesare the innovators commercializing clean tech-nologies and their progress is accelerating atan astonishing rate. In agricultural biotechnology, crops on the market have been modified to protect themfrom insect damage thus reducing pesticideuse. Biotech crops that are herbicide tolerantenable farmers to control weeds without dam-aging the crops. This allows farmers flexibilityin weed management and promotes conserva-tion tillage. Other biotech crops are protectedagainst viral diseases with the plant equivalentof a vaccine. Biotech fruits and vegetables aretastier and firmer and remain fresher longer. The number of acres worldwide planted with biotech crops soared from 4.3 million in 1996to 100 million in 1999, of which 81 millionacres were planted in the United States andCanada. Acceptance of these crops by farm-ers is one indication of the benefits they havefor reducing farming costs and use of pes-ticides while increasing crop yields. Biotech crops in development include foods that will offer increased levels of nutrients andvitamins. Benefits range from helping devel-oping nations meet basic dietary requirementsto creating disease-fighting and health-pro-moting foods. Biotechnology is improving the lives of those in the U.S. and abroad. The designation ofJanuary 2000 as National BiotechnologyMonth is an indication to our constituents andtheir children that Congress recognizes thevalue and the promise of this technology. Bio-technology is a big word that means hope. HONORING LARRY LEDERHAUSE HON. SCOTT McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to pause and remember thelife of Larry Lederhause who passed away onDecember 11, 1999. Many relatives and closefriends will miss this remarkable person. Larry Lederhause was born on January 30, 1963. He attended Eagle Valley Junior/SeniorHigh School in Gypsum, Colorado. He wasvery involved in 4\u00b1H and Future Farmers ofAmerica projects. He served as a volunteerwith the Gypsum Fire Department. Larry at-tended college in Oregon at Western BaptistCollege. VerDate 27<JAN>2000 Remarks E37 January 31, 2000 Larry returned to Colorado and worked for the Garfield County Airport. He then ownedand operated L&L Sanitation Service. Larry loved animals, especially his dog, Happy. Larry also sang with the ``SagebrushSingers'' of the Battlement Mesa and liked togo hunting, hiking, swimming and flying. It is with this, Mr. Speaker, I would like to remember Mr. Larry Lederhause, a greatAmerican who was loved and cherished mymany. THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION STATEMENT INREFERENCE TO CERTAIN TYPESOF RELIGIOUS BROADCASTING HON. CHARLES W. ``CHIP'' PICKERING OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. PICKERING. Mr. Speaker, in December of last year, the Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) overstepped its boundsand authority by issuing statements that if en-forced, would restrict certain types of religiousbroadcasting. I am happy to report that the FCC reversed its decision on Friday. I applaud the decisionof the FCC but am troubled that such a deci-sion was ever made. While issuing a ruling on a routine license transfer, the FCC editorialize about new, strictstandards for educational programming thatcould have affected many non-commercial,educational television broadcasters. The FCCstated that ``religious exhortation, proselytizing,or statements not qualifyas `general education' programming. Thus,church services generally will not qualify as`general education' under our rules.'' It is arrogance of the highest form for the FCC to attempt to determine what is\u00d0and\u00d0what is not educational. The FCC's statementsamount to an unconstitutional restriction on re-ligious speech. This type of content regulationand suppression of religious expression is notacceptable. The FCC is neither qualified nordoes it have any legal authority to engage inthis sort of line drawing. The FCC was established by the Commu- nications Act of 1934 and is charged with reg-ulating interstate and international communica-tions by radio, television, wire, satellite andcable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. pos-sessions. The Federal Communications Com-mission (FCC) is an independent UnitedStates government agency, directly respon-sible to Congress. Shortly after reading the FCC's anti-religious statements, Reps. M IKEOXLEY, STEVELARGENT, CLIFFSTEARNSand I wrote the Chairman of the FCC to remind him that theFCC is still directly responsible to Congressand that he should reverse the anti-religiousstatements or he could stand by and see itoverturned by Congressional action. Last week, we introduced H.R. 3525\u00d0The Religious Broadcasting Freedom Act to over-turn the ruling issued by the FCC and did sowith over 60 cosponsors. The FCC is account-able to the Congress and I believe we havedemonstrated that we will take decisive actionwhen the FCC or any other federal agency ex-ceeds its authority\u00d0and especially when suchactions threaten our religious freedoms. The FCC's action was an unprecedented action by a government agency in an attemptto decide what is acceptable religious pro-gramming and content. The fact is, it is not theplace of any government agency to determinewhat is acceptable religious speech becausereligious freedom and freedom of speech areboth protected by the Constitution. I have heard from many religious broad- casters in Mississippi and across the countrywho expressed outrage at the FCC and theiractions. I am pleased to tell them that wehave stopped this un-Constitutional decision inits tracts. Yet, I urge my colleagues to remainvigilant. I assure you that if the FCC takes anyactions that suggest they may attempt to pur-sue this action in any other format, I will fightit once again. TRIBUTE TO PHIL BLAZER HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN OF CALIFORNIA HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN OF CALIFORNIA HON. BRAD SHERMAN OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 31, 2000 Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues Mr. BERMANand Mr. S HERMAN, and I rise today to ask our colleagues to join us in hon-oring the extraordinary career of our dearfriend Phil Blazer. Phil has dedicated his thirty-five-year career to serving the Jewish commu-nity as editor and publisher of the JewishNews and as an effective activist for importantJewish and human rights causes. Phil beganhis career as an eager and wide-eyed seven-teen-year-old radio announcer at KVFM in theSan Fernando Valley of California. He movedto Minnesota for college and continued hisradio career at KUXL, and quickly began aJewish community radio program for Min-neapolis and St. Paul. After college, heretuned to KVFM as station manager and con-tinued his Jewish community program in the San Fernando Valley. Phil's current radio pro-gram is now on KIEV and is heard throughoutSouthern California. He has many devoted lis-teners who depend on his program for news,perspective, and insight. In 1977, Phil started a television program, which still airs today and is now carried inover 300 communities in Southern California.It is also broadcast in New York City and NewJersey on Sundays. His audience numbersover 250,000 people and he has become anicon to his audiences throughout the nation. Perhaps Phil's greatest contribution has been his newspaper, The Jewish News, whichhe founded in 1973. Hardly a local paper, itnow serves 73 countries worldwide. The Jew-ish News serves to connect distinct Jewishcommunities by sharing local, national andinternational news and trends. It is a belovedpaper and a staple of Los Angeles Jewish life. Phil's career has also been dedicated to human rights work and Jewish causes. He isa visionary leader who has worked to shapecritical historical events. In 1973, he helpedsmuggle a Torah into Leningrad to support theJews of Russia. In 1978, he traveled to Wash-ington, D.C. at the invitation of former Sec-retary of State Cyrus Vance to confer with theState Department and the White House as aparticipant in the redirection of U.S. MiddleEast policy. Also in 1978, Phil attended the historic Begin/Sadat meeting in Jerusalem. The fol-lowing year he aired a landmark broadcast ofhis radio program via satellite from the studiosof Radio Cairo as the guest of Anwar Sadat. Phil's philanthropic work continued in 1985 when he organized the now famous OperationJoshua, which succeeded in rescuing nearly1,000 Ethiopian Jews from refugee camps inSudan and resettling them in Israel. In 1992,Phil developed California legislation with As-semblyman Richard Katz that mandated acourse of study about the Holocaust be taughtin all California public schools. This bill wassigned into law by the Governor of Californiaon September 21, 1992. These are a few examples of Phil's tireless dedication to Jewish causes and human rightsaround the world. His real gift, however, is hiscompassion and love for humankind. Whilesuccessfully building his own media empire,Phil has never lost sight of his commitment tobetter the human condition in every way pos-sible. He is truly an example of one personmaking a difference in thousands of people'slives. Mr. Speaker, we ask our colleagues to join us in honoring Phil Blazer for his remarkableaccomplishments over the past thirty-fiveyears and in wishing him continued successand happiness in all future endeavors.
