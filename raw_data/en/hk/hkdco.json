Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) It is well made and holds its shape. It's comfortable, and I can take it anywhere. Happy to have added this to what I use. We are so glad you are loving your meditation cushion, Jeff! Cushion is sturdy, yet comfy. Also a good height off the floor. Love that it's non toxic. I don't smell any strange odors - it's great! This is amazing to hear, Lui! My wife loves it Really enjoy my purchases Stoked to hear that, Debra! I have started yoga to work on flexibility, and find it very difficult to sit on the floor in a cross legged pose. This cushion gives me the support I need while I work on improving my flexibility and health. It is firm and supportive and doesn't slide around like sitting on pillows do. That's wonderful to hear! Thanks for the feedback :) Super light so its not much of a hassle to move around or take somewhere aside from it's bulk. Unfortunately its not much more comfortable than just sitting on a block. I am hoping with use the filling will break up more and be closer to the comfort of a traditional buckwheat husk filled version. "}
