Our mission To improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians by: caring for individuals and the community caring for those who need it most making best use of funds and resources supporting our team. Our values WA Health's Code of Conduct identifies the values that we hold as fundamental in our work and describes how these values translate into action. Our values can be summarised as: Care - Respect - Excellence Integrity - Teamwork - LeadershipMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 3Executive summary WA Health is a leading public health system that in 2012-13 performed well for the Western Australian community despite high demand for its services from the State's burgeoning population. It also came amid change at the helm of the organisation with the departure of Kim Snowball in March 2013, after almost three years in the Director General's role. This solid performance was underpinned by long-term planning, regular and ongoing monitoring and review, innovative reform and a professional 43,000-strong workforce. Delivering a healthy WA While recognising that sections of the community experience poorer health outcomes than the rest, Western Australians as a whole enjoy an excellent standard of health, reflected in life expectancy among the best in the world and infant mortality rates among the lowest in Australia. Western Australians benefit from effective public health programs, responsive health services and hospitals which, in the provision of patient care, meet high standards of safety and quality. WA Health continually strives to improve its performance and align its efforts to the four key pillars of the WA Health Strategic Intent 2010-15 : caring for individuals and the community caring for those who need it most making the best use of funds and resources supporting our team. The Metropolitan Health Service operates as part of the broader health system, providing the bulk of public healthcare services - including emergency and elective surgery care - throughout the Perth metropolitan area. It delivers these services through a comprehensive range of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities. The Metropolitan Health Service also plays an integral role in delivering health service reform and safety and quality improvement. The 2012-13 year began with a major restructure of public health system governance by appointing high-level governing councils. The new governing councils are: North Metropolitan Health Service Governing Council South Metropolitan Health Service Governing Council Child and Adolescent Health Service Governing Council Northern and Remote Country Governing Council Southern Country Governing Council WA Health also pushed ahead with a $7 billion infrastructure overhaul that is expanding and transforming hospitals and health services across Western Australia. Overview of AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 4In 2012-13 the recommendations of a far reaching review of mental health practices in Western Australia commenced implementation and set the pace on emergency department reform. Caring for individuals and the community The Metropolitan Health Service kept its commitment to deliver safe, high-quality, evidence-based health care to patients and the community by adopting new national safety and quality health service standards. At the same time local clinical governance systems and processes continued to be met. In 2012-13 a range of measures to improve emergency department services were implemented. Metropolitan Health Service hospitals outperformed all other states and territories in admitting, discharging or referring emergency department patients within four hours under the National Emergency Access Target. Throughout the year Metropolitan Health Service staff worked hard to minimise disease and injury through a range of preventative health measures that included: the delivery of human papillomavirus vaccine to high school boys in years 8, 9 and 10 the opening of a new breast screening clinic - The Rose Clinic - in David Jones' city store a chronic disease prevention program targeting Aboriginal people in the metropolitan area communicable disease surveillance, public health management and contact tracing. New subacute care programs and services were also opened and existing ones expanded. Medical procedures never previously performed in Western Australia were also undertaken, paving the way for new and improved treatments for patients. The successful insertion of the first dissolvable cardiac stent in WA - performed by cardiologists at Fremantle Hospital - was one such procedure. Researchers embarked on new and exciting studies, such as an investigation into the use of testosterone to prevent diabetes, and a range of research grants were awarded. Caring for those who need it most The Metropolitan Health Service is committed to achieving substantive equality throughout its services and works hard to ensure those in greatest need of its services are able to access them in a timely manner. To this end, the Metropolitan Health Service continued to implement and maintain initiatives established under the Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes National Partnership Agreement which seeks to end the disparity in health and wellbeing between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. One such initiative is credited with having raised the average birth weight of babies and contributed to a decline in the rate of young Aboriginal women smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Overview of AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 5Among other programs and initiatives helping to improve health outcomes for Aboriginal people in the metropolitan area was a program to help Aboriginal women deliver their babies safely, an Aboriginal ambulatory care coordination initiative and an award-winning Aboriginal Maternity Services Support Unit. New community-based care packages and a strengthened care coordination network were introduced to give older patients an alternative to in-hospital care. Under the National Partnership Agreement on Treating More Public Dental Patients, close to $30 million was also pledged to treat more public dental patients. Improvements were made in the area of mental health, following reports undertaken by the Office of the Chief Psychiatrist and a far-reaching review into the admission referral discharge and transfer practices of public mental health facilities. Making the best use of funds and resources The WA Health Clinical Services Framework 2010-2020 continued to guide the structure of public health service provision. During 2012-13 significant progress was made on a host of major construction projects. At the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre a new central energy plant, the PathWest Centre, comprehensive cancer centre and the first phase of a multi-deck car park for staff and visitors were completed. Meanwhile, work continued at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre on other major projects including the $1.2 billion New Children's Hospital, the new Western Australian Institute for Medical Research facility and new mental health unit. Across town, Fiona Stanley Hospital - set to become WA's flagship health facility - continued to take shape and the Bentley Adolescent Mental Health Unit, the State's only mental health inpatient facility which provides acute mental health care to adolescents up to 18 years of age, underwent a $4.5 million upgrade. Throughout the Metropolitan Health Service the use of new technologies was embraced and expanded upon. Greater use was made of telehealth and videoconferencing facilities in the provision of clinical care and education sessions while the installation of 18 new digital x-ray machines pushed BreastScreen WA a step closer to becoming fully digital in all aspects of screening and reading. Supporting our team The staffing needs of a major health system are both vast and complex, and ensuring the system has the right people to meet current and future needs requires extensive and ongoing planning. Changes to the landscape of the health system have added to the complexity of workforce planning but a range of initiatives has helped maintain a focus on attracting, recruiting and retaining the best people. Overview of AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 6The initiatives include employee intentions surveys to inform planning, a program to up skill and identify medical leaders of the future and a \"working across multiple sites policy\" that not only ensures health services align with an area-wide approach to the delivery of clinical services, but maximises use of resources and improves patient care. The Metropolitan Health Service also invested in staff though initiatives such as a medical leadership program to develop medical leaders of the future and an online wound education program for enrolled nurses to enhance their clinical skills and increase their job satisfaction. Increasing the number of Aboriginal people working in our health system is recognised as a key to improving the health of Aboriginal people. The Metropolitan Health Service has employed a range of measures to help build its Aboriginal workforce including an Aboriginal traineeship program and an Aboriginal mentorship program. The Metropolitan Health Service enters the new year keen to consolidate and build on the achievements of 2012-13, positive about the changes ahead - including the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital - and determined to continue serving the community with excellent health care that helps Western Australians lead healthy and fulfilling lives.

In 2014, the $2 billion state-of-the-art Fiona Stanley Hospital (including the State rehabilitation service) will open and become an integral part of the South Metropolitan Health Service. The South Metropolitan Health Service is undergoing significant reconfiguration of its services to prepare for the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital and meet the hospital and health needs of the south metropolitan area and the broader Western Australian community. As part of this reconfiguration, the focus, roles and functions of our hospitals will change to improve access to healthcare services and enable patients to receive more complex care closer to home, often in new or refurbished facilities. Child and Adolescent Health Service The Child and Adolescent Health Service comprises Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Child and Adolescent Community Health Service and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. Princess Margaret Hospital is a paediatric tertiary teaching hospital. It is Western Australia's only dedicated paediatric hospital for treating children and adolescents from around the State. Construction of the new children's hospital is now well underway. The new $1.2 billion hospital will include an integrated paediatric research and education facility being built at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre site in Nedlands. It will provide inpatient, ambulatory and outpatient services and house the State's only paediatric trauma centre. The new children's hospital is scheduled for completion at the end of 2015. Child and Adolescent Community Health Service provides a comprehensive range of health promotion, early identification and intervention community-based services to children and families in metropolitan Perth, focusing on growth and development in the early years, and promoting wellbeing during childhood and adolescence. Service delivery is both universal and targeted. Groups at risk of poorer health outcomes, such as Aboriginal people and newly arrived refugees, are of particular focus. Overview of AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 28The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service provides mental health services to infants, children, young people and their families across the Perth metropolitan area. Services include inpatient care at Princess Margaret Hospital and the Bentley Adolescent Unit, the State's only authorised facility for young people under the age of 18 years. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service also provides 11 community clinics across the metropolitan area and a number of statewide specialist intervention programs. Performance against national elective surgery and emergency access targets National Elective Surgery Target Western Australia signed the National Health Partnership on Improving Public Health Services in 2011. The agreement includes the National Elective Surgery Target (NEST). This program progressively increases and measures the numbers of elective surgeries and reduces long waits for patients. The objective of the National Elective Surgery Target is to progressively increase the number of elective surgeries performed within the clinically recommended time by 2016. The National Elective Surgery Target commenced on 1 January 2012 and focuses on two areas: part 1: a stepped improvement in the number of patients treated within the clinically recommended time. part 2: a progressive reduction in the number of patients who are overdue for surgery, particularly patients who have waited the longest beyond the clinically recommended time. Overview of AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 29WA Health performance for National Elective Surgery Target part 1 For WA Health, Table 4 shows the 2012 monthly trend for all elective surgery cases treated within the clinically recommended time.

This result was marginally above the National Partnership Agreement target of 65 days. National Emergency Access Target Western Australia signed the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services in 2011. The agreement includes the National Emergency Access Target, which aims to drive improvements in access to emergency care for patients. The National Emergency Access Target requires that by 2015, 90 per cent of all patients presenting to a public hospital emergency department will be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. Between now and 2015 each state is required to meet annual interim targets which increase progressively until 2015. National Emergency Access Target performance is calculated as an average of all participating hospitals over the calendar year. In the Perth metropolitan area, the participating hospitals include all tertiary hospitals (Fremantle Hospital, King Edward Memorial Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Royal Perth Hospital and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital), as well as general hospitals (Armadale-Kelmscott Memorial Hospital, Rockingham General Hospital, Swan District Hospital, Joondalup Health Campus and Peel Health Campus). The National Emergency Access Target performance benchmark for WA for period 1 (1 January - 31 December 2012) is 76 per cent. In 2012, metropolitan National Emergency Access Target hospitals' overall result is 75.7 per cent, marginally short of the National Partnership Agreement National Emergency Access Target. Overview of AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 35Health snapshot of population Each year WA Health commissions a general health and wellbeing survey. The survey is conducted independently across the State and collects self-reported health information from randomly selected respondents aged 16 years and over. The following is a summary of some of the health-related information for the metropolitan area in 2012. Overweight or obese In metropolitan WA, 65.3 per cent of respondents were overweight or obese.

Fulfilling this commitment requires quality assurance and accreditation of health services, both of which are currently assessed against two sets of standards. These are the: Australian Council of Healthcare Standards (ACHS) National Safety and Quality Health Service (NSQHS) standards. The core accreditation program for health services is the ACHS Evaluation and Quality Improvement Program (EQuIP). This program guides organisations through a four-year cycle of self-assessment, an organisation-wide survey, and a periodic review to meet ACHS standards. The NSQHS standards provide a quality assurance mechanism that determines whether relevant systems are in place to ensure minimum standards of safety and quality. Its standards also provide a quality improvement mechanism that enables health services to realise aspirational or developmental goals. Accreditation to the NSQHS standards commenced on 1 January 2013. To continue to be accredited by the ACHS against EQuIP and to comply with NSQHS standards, implementation of EQuIPNational - a four-year ACHS accreditation program for health services - is being implemented. EQuIPNational includes the: 10 NSQHS standards against which hospitals and day procedure centres are required to be accredited under the national accreditation model for jurisdictions five EQuIPNational standards that cover the performance of service delivery processes, provision of care and non-clinical systems. In addition to national mandatory accreditation requirements, health services also apply local clinical governance systems and processes. South Metropolitan Health Service In 2012 Royal Perth Hospital, Armadale Hospital and Fremantle Hospital successfully underwent the ACHS EQuIP periodic review. Kaleeya Maternity Unit has achieved 'Baby Friendly Accreditation' for three years. This encourages and supports mothers to start and maintain breastfeeding and is the global standard for assessing and accrediting hospitals. The WA Health Clinical Incident Management Policy has been fully implemented. It involved revision of the South Metropolitan Health Service Clinical Incident Management Guidelines and development and implementation of an education and training plan. Metropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 39North Metropolitan Health Service In December 2012, Osborne Park Hospital achieved ACHS EQuIP accreditation following an onsite organisation-wide survey. The Women and Newborn Health Service also completed a successful ACHS EQuIP Periodic Review in October 2012, achieving three areas of excellence. The Women and Newborn Health Service has commenced implementation of the NSQHS Standards. Improving public hospital services in meeting patient demand The National Health Reform Agreement - National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services 2010-2016 was introduced in 2011. The agreement is designed to improve access to Australian public hospital services, including elective surgery, emergency department services and subacute care. South Metropolitan Health Service Emergency services South Metropolitan Health Service sites are implementing a range of initiatives to improve emergency department services including: a reform action plan to guide monitoring and service improvement activities a direct admissions policy at Fremantle Hospital and Health Service whereby all clinically appropriate patients, transferred from external hospitals, consultant rooms and outpatient clinics, bypass the emergency department and are admitted directly to a ward increasing the referral of appropriate patients to care coordination teams in the community. Elective surgery The South Metropolitan Health Service continues to monitor elective surgery performance and develop innovative area-wide strategies. These strategies include the redirection of patients between South Metropolitan Health Service sites or to Bethesda Private Hospital to maximise the number of patients undergoing their surgery within the clinically recommended time. Subacute care During 2012-13 a number of projects have been implemented to enhance capacity and the ability to provide a suite of services according to demographic demand and to reduce wait lists and times over 2011-2014. These have included: improving patient care delivery practices at day therapy units to support efficient throughput of patients to the new subacute care beds at Rockingham, Bentley and Armadale. Bentley Hospital, Armadale Hospital and Fremantle Hospital have achieved a reduction in wait lists and wait times the establishment of a community rehabilitation service at Armadale Health Service to support the expansion and diversification of non-admitted subacute care services, including improving the connection between existing services Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 40 the establishment of a single point of referral and goal-oriented rehabilitation services within an interdisciplinary model of service delivery. Services have expanded to cater for patients under 65 years of age and a wider range of condition groups across the adult age continuum the expansion of the South Metropolitan Health Service Falls Specialist Service at Armadale, Bentley, Fremantle, Rockingham, Peel and Mercy day therapy units. This service targets older people who have experienced a fall or who are at risk of having a fall. The service is integrated with inpatient subacute care, primary care, community care and health services. North Metropolitan Health Service Emergency services North Metropolitan Health Service sites are implementing initiatives to improve emergency department services. These include a Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital model that supports medical and nursing teams in the emergency department to facilitate earlier senior clinician involvement to reduce delays in the decision to admit, discharge or transfer. Elective surgery North Metropolitan Health Service sites have worked to improve elective surgery performance using a range of strategies including the coordination of elective surgery across sites. This has led to an improvement in patient waitlists. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 41Subacute care The Osborne Park Hospital Secondary Stroke Unit offers an intensive stroke- specific rehabilitation program to stroke patients. The unit is made up of 10 inpatient beds, an outpatient service and an early supported discharge program. Implementing improvements and innovation in health service delivery To remain a world-class health system WA Health must rely on a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. This involves fostering clinical and administrative leadership to provide high-quality and safe services, improve patient flow through the system and drive efficient practices. In 2012-13, WA Health drew on this leadership to improve inpatient and outpatient services and support medical research to improve the way we treat patients. South Metropolitan Health Service Key South Metropolitan Health Service initiatives during 2012-13 included the: implementation of a Changes in Memory and Thinking Group at the Moss Street Centre, helping people with mild cognitive impairments and their families to achieve a better quality of life commencement of a physiotherapy amputee outpatient outreach service at Rockingham General Hospital in response to an identified service gap in which a significant number of amputee clients from the hospital's catchment were travelling to the Fremantle Hospital and Health Service site for specialist amputee rehabilitation opening of a dedicated endoscopy theatre at Rockingham General Hospital to support and streamline surgical activity insertion of the first dissolvable cardiac stent in WA by Fremantle Hospital cardiologists first major laparoscopic liver resection at Fremantle Hospital, a less invasive technique with faster recovery time for patients commencement of world-first studies at Fremantle Hospital investigating the use of testosterone to prevent diabetes and a clinical cardiosonic trial development of a South Metropolitan Health Service research strategy Improving Health through Research , that is being implemented through a collaborative approach with involvement from South Metropolitan Health Service hospital sites, universities, research institutes and industry awarding of research grants during 2012-13 including Round 6 State Health Research Advisory Council (SHRAC) Research Translation Projects, a Cancer Australian grant, and Medical Research Foundation grants for burns research, and HIV/AIDS research. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 42North Metropolitan Health Service Key North Metropolitan Health Service initiatives during 2012-13 included: enabling BreastScreen WA health promotion staff to use their laptops at community events to identify and book appointments for women due for screening continuing the call-back project which targets women who have not had a breast screen for three years. Aboriginal women have been especially targeted through the project, resulting in improvements to screening rates amongst this group implementation of the North Metropolitan Health Service Chemical Strategy Group that aims to inform and implement a system for managing chemicals and hazardous substances introduction of laparoscopic kidney transplants that reduce patient recovery time, scarring and complications associated with open surgical techniques. This is an Australian first by the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Transplant Team brain stem stimulation and ablation techniques to treat central tremors and severe epilepsy. Preventing chronic disease and injury The increasing prevalence of chronic health conditions, combined with an ageing population and high community expectations for improved quality of life, requires a flexible and responsive health system that can deliver services across the continuum of care. WA Health is responding to this growing need with: health promotion, illness prevention and early intervention strategies that target priority populations primary care initiatives that promote active participation by people in their own health care in their own communities. South Metropolitan Health Service The South Metropolitan Public Health Unit has been responsible for the following activities in 2012-13: a range of programs that have been developed and implemented to deal with the risk factors of smoking, poor nutrition, harmful alcohol use, and lack of physical activity communicable disease surveillance, public health case management, and contact tracing delivery of the annual seasonal influenza vaccination program for healthcare workers which provides free vaccination to these workers continued collaboration with immunisation providers including general practice, Medicare Locals, and Child and Adolescent Community Health to improve childhood immunisation rates in the South Metropolitan Health Service.

Clinical service planning and redesign The WA Health Clinical Services Framework 2010-2020 sets out the planned structure of public health service provision in WA for the next 10 years. It is an important tool for strategic statewide planning and will assist health services in developing localised clinical service plans. Health Services introduced a number of strategies to improve the efficiency of service provision, particularly in hospitals. Principal among these initiatives was a program of service redesign based on the Clinical Services Framework 2010-2020 . South Metropolitan Health Service The South Metropolitan Health Service is the fastest growing health service in WA, undergoing major changes with the implementation of an unprecedented level of clinical service reform and infrastructure development to meet the growing and changing health care needs of the community. This involves the reconfiguration of all hospitals in preparation for the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital in 2014. This process is being guided by the South Metropolitan Health Service Clinical Services Plan 2010-2020 and site clinical service plans for the Royal Perth Hospital Group, Fremantle Hospital and Health Service, Rockingham Peel Group and Armadale Health Service. In 2012-13 commissioning teams have been appointed for Royal Perth Hospital Group, Fremantle Hospital and Health Service, Rockingham Peel Group and Armadale Health Service, tasked with implementing new service delivery models. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 51North Metropolitan Health Service The North Metropolitan Health Service Clinical Services Plan 2013-2015 is the guide for clinical service delivery in the North Metropolitan Health Service. The plan is informed by the Clinical Services Framework 2010-2020 and provides the detailed overarching plans for clinical services up to 2015 bringing together service, activity and reform directions. The Quadriplegic Centre Clinical Services Plan 2012-2020 describes the range of services provided by the centre for people with spinal cord paralysis, in particular people with quadriplegia. Child and Adolescent Health Service The Paediatric Implementation Plan has been developed to support and guide the implementation of the paediatric components of the Clinical Services Framework 2010- 2020 .

The legal entities are: Department of Health Metropolitan Health Service Western Australian Country Health Service Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre Trust Quadriplegic Centre. The Department of Health, Metropolitan Health Service and WA Country Health Service annual reports2 are produced by the Performance, Activity and Quality Division of the Department of Health, in collaboration with all relevant entity budget holders. Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre Trust Trust and the Quadriplegic Centre are responsible for meeting their respective annual reporting requirements. Under section 61 of the Financial Management Act 2006 and Treasurer's Instruction 904, WA Health entities are required to present annual indicators of performance to Parliament and the public through the annual reports. This performance information includes key performance indicators. The key performance indicators are reported to enable stakeholders to assess WA Health's performance in achieving government desired outcomes and the delivery of services. WA Health outcomes and services To comply with its legislative obligation as a Western Australian government agency, WA Health operates under the \"Outcome Based Management\" performance management framework.3 This framework describes how outcomes, services and Key performance indicators are used to measure agency performance towards achieving the relevant overarching whole-of-government goal. WA Health's key performance indicators measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the health services provided by WA Health in achieving the stated desired health outcomes. All WA Health reporting entities contribute to the achievement of the outcomes through health services delivered either directly by the entities or indirectly through contracts with non-government organisations. WA Health's outcomes and 2012-13 Annual Report key performance indicators are aligned to the State Government goal (see Figure 7). 1 http://www.treasury.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/_Treasury/Legislation/fab_update.pdf 2 http://www.health.wa.gov.au/publications/annual_reports.cfm 3 http://www.treasury.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/_Treasury/Publications/Outcome_Based_Management.pdf Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 73Figure 7: WA Health outcomes and services aligned to the State Government goal WA Strategic Outcome (Whole of Government) Outcome-based service delivery: Greater focus on achieving results in key service delivery areas for the benefit of all Western Australians. WA Health Strategic Intent To improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians by: caring for individuals and the community caring for those who need it most making the best use of funds and resources supporting our team. Outcome 1 Restoration of patients' health, provision of maternity care to women and newborns, and support for patients and families during terminal illness. Outcome 2 Enhanced health and well-being of Western Australians through health promotion, illness and injury prevention and appropriate continuing care. Services contributing to Outcome 1 Public hospital admitted patients Home-based hospital programs Palliative care Emergency department Public hospital non-admitted patients Patient transport Services contributing to Outcome 2 Prevention, promotion and protection Dental health Continuing care Contracted mental health services Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 74The WA Health Outcomes for achievement in 2012-13 were as follows: Outcome 1: Restoration of patients' health, provision of maternity care to women and newborns, and support for patients and families during terminal illness. Outcome 2: Enhanced health and well-being of Western Australians through health promotion, illness and injury prevention and appropriate continuing care. All health entities contribute to the achievement of these outcomes, with different health service divisions taking responsibility for specific areas. As such, the overall performance of WA Health should be determined by reading annual reports for the Department of Health, Metropolitan Health Service and WA Country Health Service. WA Health activities that are aligned to Outcome 1 and 2 are cited below. Activities related to Outcome 1 aim to: ensure that people have appropriate and timely access to acute care services when they are in need of them so that intervention occurs as early as possible provide quality diagnostic and treatment services that ensure the maximum restoration to health after an acute illness or injury provide appropriate after-care and rehabilitation to ensure that people's physical and social functioning is restored as far as possible provide appropriate obstetric care during pregnancy and the birth episode to both mother and child provide appropriate care and support for patients and their families during terminal illness. Activities related to Outcome 2 aim to: increase the likelihood of optimal health and wellbeing by: providing programs that support the optimal physical, social and emotional development of infants and children encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet and exercise) reduce the likelihood of onset of disease or injury by: immunisation programs safety programs reduce the risk of long-term disability or premature death from injury or illness through prevention, early identification and intervention, such as: programs for early detection of developmental issues in children and appropriate referral for intervention early identification and intervention of disease and disabling conditions (e.g. breast and cervical cancer screening; screening of newborns) with appropriate referrals programs that support self-management by people with diagnosed conditions and disease (e.g. diabetic education) monitor the incidence of disease in the population to determine the effectiveness of primary health measures provide continuing care services and programs that improve and enhance the wellbeing and the environment for people with chronic illness or disability. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 75Key performance indicators The suite of 2012-13 WA Health key performance indicators consists of key effeciency and effectiveness indicators that aim to cover each outcome and each service respectively. Combined, these key performance indicators report the extent to which the strategies and activities of WA Health contribute to achieving the agency's outcomes. Each key performance indicator within the approved suite of indicators has been defined to: ensure accuracy and consistency in data collection, collation and analysis support the interpretation of a key performance indicator in terms of what is being measured allow for comparisons across WA Health services support the audit process conducted by the Office of the Auditor General. The health of the Western Australian community has many determinants; including the provision of health services, access to and use of other government services and numerous environmental and social factors. Key performance indicator reporting requirements WA Health is required under an Act of Parliament, as well as the Treasurer's Instructions, to present key performance indicators to Parliament. The Office of the Auditor General will perform an interim audit of information systems, followed by a final audit of key performance indicators. For those key performance indicators related to Outcome 2, the findings may be presented by Aboriginality if the data is available and meaningful. Comparative results across time are provided wherever possible and as appropriate. All efficiency indicators are reported as both actual and Consumer Price Index adjusted figures. The health service population is based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data used in the Epidemiology Branch Rates Calculator estimated 2012 resident population figures.

Performance targets Effectiveness indicator targets have been based on published national averages for performance indicators where available, or from the analysis of previous performance results Efficiency indicator targets are derived from the 2012-13 Government Budget Statements and may be revised in the 2013-14 Government Budget Statements Targets have also been developed by Performance Activity and Quality Division and/or key stakeholders where national targets are not available. Consumer price index deflator series All efficiency indicators are reported as both actual and Consumer Price Index adjusted figures. The index figures are derived from the Consumer Price Index's 'all groups', weighted average of the eight capital cities index numbers. For the financial year series, the index is the average of the December and March quarters and is rebased to reflect a mid-year point of the five year series that appears in the annual reports. The average of the December and March quarters is used, because the full-year index series is not available in time for the annual reporting cycle. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 77Efficiency indicators The efficient use of resources can help minimise the overall costs of providing health care. While it is important to monitor the unit cost of the various components of hospital care and healthcare services in order to ensure overall quality and cost effectiveness, it should be noted that variations in patient characteristics and clinic service types between sites and across time, can result in differences in service delivery costs. Mental health The Mental Health Commission of Western Australia has assumed policy control and management of the provision of mental health services in Western Australia. The mental health efficiency indicators reported in the Metropolitan Health Service report represent services provided under agreement with the Mental Health Commission. Service descriptions 1. Public hospital admitted patients Public hospital admitted patient services describe services provided to patients admitted into public hospitals, or admitted as public patients into privately managed hospitals that are under contract to the Department of Health (excluding specialised mental health wards). An admission to hospital can be for a period of one or more days and includes medical and surgical treatment, renal dialysis, oncology services, and obstetric care. 2. Home-based hospital programs The home-based hospital service can be provided for patients who can be safely cared for without constant monitoring, and whose conditions have traditionally required hospital admission and inpatient treatment. This service is provided by the health services and non-government providers and involves daily home visits by nurses, with medical governance usually overseen by a hospital-based doctor. This service is delivered through programs such as Hospital in the Home, Rehabilitation in the Home and Mental Health in the Home, which provide short-term acute care in the patient's home, and the Friend in Need Emergency program, which delivers care interventions for older and chronically ill patients with a range of short-term clinical care requirements. 3. Palliative care Palliative care services describe inpatient and home-based multidisciplinary care and support for terminally ill people and their families and carers. Education and advisory services are also available to assist health care professionals, particularly those in rural areas. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 784. Emergency department Emergency department services describe the treatment provided to people with the sudden onset of illness or injury requiring urgent medical attention. An emergency department can provide a range of services. Patients attending an emergency department may be admitted to hospital or be treated without admission. The service includes privately managed contracted emergency services, however not all public hospitals provide emergency department services. 5. Public hospital non-admitted patients Medical officers, nurses and allied health staff provide non-admitted (outpatient) care services which include clinics for pre and post-surgical care, allied health care and medical care, as well as emergency services provided in small rural hospitals that are not included under the emergency department service. 6. Patient transport Patient transport services assist patients in reaching appropriate and timely access to medical treatment. The service includes St John Ambulance Australia and the Royal Flying Doctor Service (Western Operations), which assist patients in need of urgent medical treatment. Also included is the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme, which provides a subsidy towards the cost of travel and accommodation for eligible permanent country residents, and their approved escorts, who are required to travel a long distance to access certain categories of specialist medical services. 7. Prevention, promotion and protection Prevention, promotion and protection services aim to achieve optimal health and wellbeing of the Western Australian population. The service implements strategies that encourage healthy lifestyles, aim to reduce the risk and onset of disease and disability, provide facility for early detection of health issues, and monitor the incidence of disease in the population. Some areas covered by this service include communicable disease control, environmental health, disaster planning and management, child and community health, and health promotion activities. 8. Dental health Dental health services aim to prevent oral and dental health issues as well as facilitate access to oral health care for target populations. This service includes the: School Dental Program, which provides dental health assessment and treatment for school children adult dental service, which ensures equity of access to financially and/or geographically disadvantaged Western Australians specialist and general oral health services provided by the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia to financially disadvantaged Western Australians. Dental health services are provided through government-funded dental clinics. Mobile dental services and private dental practitioners participate in the metropolitan and country patient dental subsidy schemes. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 79 Key Performance Indicators9. Continuing care Aged and continuing care services are those services that are provided to Western Australians in need of long-term assistance to maintain their health and lead independent lives. This service is delivered to the Western Australian community through programs such as: the Home and Community Care program, which provides services such as nursing care and domestic assistance the Transition Care Program, which aims to help older people stay independent after a hospital stay non-government continuing care programs, which offer residential care type services for aged or disabled persons residential care and nursing home care provided by the State chronic illness support services, which provide people who have a chronic condition with treatment and preventive care to enable them to remain healthy at home. 10. Contracted mental health Contracted mental health services describe inpatient care in an authorised ward and community mental health services provided by health services under agreement with the Mental Health Commission.Metropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 80 Key Performance IndicatorsOutcome 1: Restoration of patients' health, provision of maternity care to women and newborns and support for patients and families during terminal illness The achievement of this health objective outcome involves activities which: ensure that people have appropriate and timely access to acute care services when they are in need of them so that intervention occurs as early as possible. Timely and appropriate access ensures that the acute illness does not progress or the effects of injury do not progress, increasing the chance of complete recovery from the illness or injury (for example access to elective surgery) provide quality diagnostic and treatment services that ensure the maximum restoration to health after an acute illness or injury provide appropriate after care and rehabilitation to ensure that people's physical and social functioning is restored as far as possible provide appropriate obstetric care during pregnancy and the birth episode to both mother and child provide appropriate care and support for patients and their families during terminal illness.Metropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 81Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Percentage of patients discharged to home after admitted hospital treatment Rationale The main goals of healthcare provision are to ensure that people receive appropriate evidenced-based health care without experiencing preventable harm and that effective partnerships are forged between consumers, healthcare providers and organisations. Through achieving improvements in the specific priority areas that these goals describe, hospitals can deliver safer and higher-quality care, better outcomes for patients and provide a more effective and efficient health system. Measuring the number of patients discharged home after hospital care allows for the monitoring of changes over time that can enable the identification of the priority areas for improvement. This in turn enables the determination of targeted interventions and health promotion strategies, aimed at ensuring optimal restoration of patients' health. Target The 2012 target is 98.1 per cent. The target is based on the best result achieved within the previous five years. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result exceeding or equal to the target. Results During 2012, a total of 98 per cent of Metropolitan Health Service public patients, across all ages, were discharged home after receiving admitted hospital treatment. This result is consistent with prior years. Figure 8: Percentage of public patients discharged to home after admitted hospital treatment in Metropolitan Health Service public hospitals, 2008 to 2012 2011 2012 Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 82The percentage of patients discharged home generally decreases with age. Fewer patients aged 80 years and over are discharged home when compared to patients aged less than 40 years. Table 7: Percentage of public patients discharged to home after admitted hospital treatment in Metropolitan Health Service public hospitals, by age group, 2008 to 2012 Age group (years)Year 2008 (%)2009 Hospital Morbidity Data System. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 83Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Survival rates for sentinel conditions Rationale Hospital survival indicators should be used as screening tools, rather than being assumed to be definitively diagnostic of poor quality and/or safety. This indicator measures a hospital's performance in relation to restoring the health of people who have suffered a sentinel condition specifically a stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or fractured neck of femur (FNOF). For these conditions, a good recovery is more likely when there is early intervention and appropriate care on presentation to an emergency department and on admission to hospital. These three conditions have been chosen as they are particularly significant for the health care of the community and are leading causes of death and hospitalisation in Australia. Patient survival after being admitted for one of these three sentinel conditions can be affected by many factors which include the diagnosis, the treatment given or procedure performed, age, co-morbidities at the time of the admission and complications which may have developed while in hospital. Target The 2012 target for each condition by age group: Age group (years)Sentinel condition Stroke AMI FNOF target is based on the best result achieved within the previous five years. If a result of 100 per cent is obtained the next best result is adopted to address the issue of small numbers. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result exceeding or equal to the target. Results The performance of Metropolitan Health Service hospitals varies by sentinel condition. In 2012, the survival rate for stroke (95.3 per cent) was slightly above the target of 93.6 per cent for patients aged 0-49 years. For all other age groups performance was below the target. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 84Table 8: Metropolitan Health Service survival rate for stroke, by age group, 2008 to 2012 Age group (years) Year 2008 (%)2009 an acute myocardial infarction, the survival rate was above or equal to the target with the exception of patients aged 60-69 years (97.4 per cent compared to 98.4 per cent), and 70-79 years (95.8 per cent compared to 96.0 per cent). Table 9: Metropolitan Health Service survival rate for AMI, by age group, 2008 to 2012 Age group (years)Year 2008 for patients with a fractured neck of femur did not meet the target in 2012.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 85Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Rate of unplanned readmissions within 28 days to the same hospital for a related condition Rationale Readmission rate is considered a global performance measure, as it potentially points to deficiencies in the functioning of the overall healthcare system. Good intervention, appropriate treatment together with good discharge planning will decrease the likelihood of unplanned hospital readmissions. There are some conditions that may require numerous admissions to enable the best level of care to be given. However, in most of these cases hospital readmission is planned. A low unplanned readmission rate suggests that good clinical practice is in operation. These readmissions necessitate patients spending additional periods of time in hospital as well as utilising additional hospital resources. By measuring and monitoring this indicator, the level of potentially avoidable hospital readmissions can be assessed in order to identify key areas for improvement. This in turn can facilitate the development and delivery of targeted care pathways and interventions, which can help to ensure effective restoration to health and improve the quality of life of Western Australians. Target The 2012 target is less than or equal to 2 per cent. The target is based on the best result achieved within the previous four years, where the result is greater than zero. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result below or equal to the target. Results In 2012, the percentage of unplanned readmissions within 28 days to a public hospital in WA was 2.3 per cent above the target of 2 per cent.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 87Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Rate of unplanned readmissions within 28 days to the same hospital for a mental health condition Rationale Readmission rate is considered a global performance measure because it potentially points to deficiencies in the functioning of the overall healthcare system. Admissions to a psychiatric facility following a recent discharge may indicate that inpatient treatment was incomplete or ineffective, or that follow-up care was inadequate to maintain the person out of hospital. These readmissions necessitate patients spending additional time in hospital and utilise additional hospital resources. Good intervention and appropriate treatment together with good discharge planning will decrease the likelihood of unplanned hospital readmissions. A low unplanned readmission rate suggests that good clinical practice is in operation. By measuring and monitoring this indicator, the level of potentially avoidable hospital readmissions for mental health patients can be assessed to identify key areas for improvement. This in turn can facilitate the development and delivery of targeted care pathways and interventions, which can aim to improve mental health and the quality of life of Western Australians. Target The 2012 target is less than or equal to 4.9 per cent. The target is based on the best result achieved within the previous five years, where the result is greater than zero. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result below or equal to the target.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 89Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Percentage of live births with an APGAR score of three or less, five minutes post delivery Rationale The APGAR score is an assessment of a baby's health at birth based on breathing, heart rate, colour, muscle tone and reflex irritability. An APGAR score is applied five minutes after delivery to determine how well the baby is adapting outside the mother's womb. The higher the APGAR score the better the health of the newborn. An APGAR score of three or less is considered to be critically low, and can indicate complications and compromise for the baby. This indicator provides a means of monitoring the effectiveness of maternity care during pregnancy and birth by identifying the potential incidence of sub-optimal outcomes. This can lead to the development and delivery of improved care pathways and interventions to improve the health outcomes of Western Australian newborns. Target The 2012 target for babies with an APGAR score of three or less, by birthweight: Birth weight (grams) Percentage 0-1499 6.7 1500-1999 0.3 2000-2499 0.3 2500+ 0.1 The target is based on the best result achieved within the previous five years, where the result is greater than zero. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result below or equal to the target. Results In 2012, with the exception of babies with a birth weight between 1500 and 1999 grams, the percentage of babies with an APGAR score of 3 or less, was equal to or below the target.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 91Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Percentage of emergency department patients seen within recommended times Rationale Emergency departments are specialist multidisciplinary units with expertise in managing acutely unwell patients for the first few hours in hospital. When patients first enter an emergency department, they are assessed by specially trained nursing staff on how urgently treatment should be provided. The aim of this process, known as triage, is to ensure treatment is given in the appropriate time and should prevent adverse conditions arising from deterioration in the patient's condition. Treatment within recommended times should assist in the restoration to health, either during the emergency visit or the admission to hospital which may follow emergency department care. A patient is allocated a triage code between 1 (most severe - resuscitation) and 5 (least severe - non-urgent) that indicates their level of urgency. This code provides an indication of how quickly patients should be reviewed by clinical staff. The triage process and scores are recognised by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine and recommended for prioritising those who present to an emergency department. In a busy emergency department when several people present at the same time, the service aims for the best outcome for all. Treatment should commence within the recommended time of the triage category allocated. By measuring this indicator, changes over time can be monitored that assist in managing the demand on emergency department services and the effectiveness of service provision. This in turn can enable the development of improved management strategies that ensure optimal restoration to health for patients. Target The 2012-13 target by triage category: Triage category Percentage Triage category 1 (resuscitation) 100 Triage category 2 (emergency) >80 Triage category 3 (urgent) >75 Triage category 4 (semi-urgent) >70 Triage category 5 (non-urgent) >70 The target is in accordance with the recommendations of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result exceeding or equal to the target. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 92Results In 2012-13, approximately 90 per cent of all patients attending a metropolitan emergency department who were assigned as triage 5, were seen within the clinically recommended times. However, in 2012-13 the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine targets for patients categorised as triage 1 to 4 were not met, consistent with previous years' performance. While it is indicated that Australasian College for Emergency Medicine targets are not being achieved for triage categories 1 to 4, it is important to note that the targets are based on commencement of care by a nurse, mental health practitioner or other health professional. In Western Australia, performance is calculated based on being seen by a doctor only and as such does not align with the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine target definition. It is also common practice in WA to see patients in triage categories 3, 4, and 5 according to time of arrival rather than triage category. This practice developed during implementation of the Four Hour Rule program so that lower triage category patients did not keep moving down the priority list, and therefore not get seen for long periods of time. As a consequence it is more difficult to be compliant with patients triaged as category 3, 4 or 5.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 95Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Percentage of admitted patients transferred to an inpatient ward within eight hours of emergency department arrival Rationale Emergency departments are specialist multidisciplinary units with expertise in managing acutely unwell patients for their first few hours in hospital. With the ever increasing demand on emergency departments and health services it is imperative that health service provision is continually monitored to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of safe high-quality care. Timely movement of patients from the emergency department is important because it potentially reduces adverse incidents that may result from overcrowding or access block (patients waiting for eight hours or more for admission). Most patients who require a hospital bed will benefit from early transfer to the inpatient unit which can best treat their condition. The monitoring of emergency department patients transferred to an inpatient ward within eight hours, can aid in supporting further improvements in clinical service redesign, bed management and health reform. This in turn can help drive improvements in the timeliness of care for patients presenting to the emergency department without any detriment to clinical care. Target The 2012-13 target is 80 per cent. The target for this indicator was initially set at 65 per cent. Over a number of years, the Health Services have implemented operational improvements that have resulted in an increase in the percentage of patients who were transferred to an inpatient ward within eight hours. The target has therefore been revised to reflect the improved results. Improved or maintained performance will be demonstrated by a result exceeding or equal to the target. Results In 2012-13, a total of 84.5 per cent of patients who attended a metropolitan public hospital emergency department, and required admission to an inpatient ward, were transferred within eight hours. The target has been met since 2008-09.

Tertiary hospitals provide critical health care for Western Australians and generally treat patients with complex health needs. While the role of tertiary hospitals is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs and characteristics of the population, they still provide core healthcare services such as acute medical care, emergency and intensive care services, complex speciality procedures, clinical research and training. Target The target for 2012-13 was $6,252 per casemix weighted separation from a tertiary hospital. A result below this target was desirable. Results For 2012-13, the average cost per casemix adjusted separation for tertiary hospitals was $6,245, below the target. The calculation for this key performance indicator does not include additional accelerated depreciation expenses of $37.3 million for Princess Margaret Hospital and Royal Perth Hospital - Shenton Park campus. Due to the nature of this expense, inclusion will distort the 2012-13 operational costs.

Non-tertiary hospitals provide crucial health care for Western Australians. As with tertiary hospitals, the role of non-tertiary hospitals is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs and characteristics of the population, yet still provide comprehensive specialist healthcare services. Through measuring the cost of a hospital stay by the range and type of patients (the casemix) treated in non-tertiary hospitals, this indicator can facilitate improved efficiency in these hospitals by providing a transparent understanding of the cost of care. Target The target for 2012-13 was $5,109 per casemix weighted separation from a non-tertiary hospital. A result below this target was desirable. Results For 2012-13 the average cost per casemix adjusted separations for non-tertiary hospitals was $5,171 and above the target. The calculation for this key performance indicator does not include additional accelerated depreciation expense of $10.9 million for Swan District Hospital. Due to the nature of this expense, inclusion will distort the 2012-13 operational costs.

Small hospitals provide essential health care and treatment within the metropolitan area in Western Australia. Through measuring the cost of a hospital stay by the range and type of patients (the casemix) treated in non-tertiary hospitals, this indicator can facilitate improved efficiency in these hospitals by providing a transparent understanding of the cost of care. Target The target for 2012-13 was $1,549 per bed-day for admitted patients (small hospitals). A result below this target was desirable. Results The average cost per bed-day for admitted patients for small metropolitan public hospitals was $1,534, and below the target. As small hospitals need to maintain and provide essential health services regardless of community demand, fluctuations in the average cost from year to year may be found.

Home-based hospital programs have been implemented as a means of ensuring all Western Australians have timely access to effective health care. These home-based programs, provided by the public health system, aim to provide safe and effective medical care for suitable patients in their home. These patients would otherwise require admission to hospital. Target The target for 2012-13 was $253 per home-based hospital patient day. A result below this target was desirable. Results For 2012-13, the average cost per home-based hospital patient day was $239 and below the target.

The Patient Assisted Travel Scheme provides a subsidy towards the cost of travel and accommodation for eligible patients travelling long distances to seek certain categories of specialist medical services. The aim of the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme is to help ensure that all Western Australians can access safe, high-quality health care when needed. Target The target for 2012-13 was $102 per Patient Assisted Travel Scheme trip. A result below the target was desirable. Results For 2012-13, the average cost per Patient Assisted Travel Scheme trip was $54, below the target. In comparison to 2011-12, current travel expenditure has decreased with the number of trips remaining stable. The lower expenditure can be attributed to efficiency measures applied in 2012-13, while maintaining access to services.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 106Outcome 2 Enhanced health and well-being of Western Australians through health promotion, illness and injury prevention and appropriate continuing care The achievement of this health objective involves activities which: 1. Increase the likelihood of optimal health and wellbeing by: providing programs that support the optimal physical, social and emotional development of infants and children encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet and exercise). 2. Reduce the likelihood of onset of disease or injury by: having an immunisation program having safety programs encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet and exercise). 3. Reduce the risk of long-term disability or premature death from injury or illness through prevention, early identification and intervention, such as: programs for early detection of developmental issues in children and appropriate referral for intervention early identification and intervention of disease and disabling conditions (breast and cervical cancer screening, screening of newborns) with appropriate referrals programs that support self-management by people with diagnosed conditions and disease (diabetic education) monitoring the incidence of disease in the population to determine the effectiveness of primary health measures. 4. Provide continuing care services and programs that improve and enhance the wellbeing and environment for people with chronic illness or disability, enabling people with chronic illness or disability to maintain as much independence in their everyday life as their illness or disability permits. This supporting people in their homes for as long as possible and providing extra care when long-term residential care is required. Services: ensure that people experience the minimum of pain and discomfort from their chronic illness or disability maintain the optimal level of physical and social functioning prevent or slow down the progression of the illness or disability enable people to live, as long as possible, in the place of their choice supported by, for example, homecare services or home delivery of meals support families and carers in their roles provide access to recreation, education and employment opportunities. Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 107Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Loss of life from premature death due to identifiable causes of preventable disease (breast and cervical cancer) Rationale Cancer is the name given to a diverse group of diseases in which some of the body's cells become defective and multiply out of control. These abnormal cells invade and damage the tissue around them, sooner or later spreading (metastasising) to other parts of the body where they can cause further damage. Cancer is Australia's leading cause of burden of disease, with one in four females being diagnosed with cancer and one in 12 being at risk of dying, before age 75. Breast cancer is estimated to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women while cervical cancers are estimated to be the twelfth most common cancer affecting Australian women. Early detection is critical because it increases survival, improves treatment options and quality of life. This is why a key priority of the WA Cancer Plan 2012-2017 is to improve survival in WA women through screening and early detection through the WA Cervical Cancer Prevention and BreastScreen programs. This indicator measures the total years of life lost from all deaths associated with breast and cervical cancer. Through identifying the impact of potential years of life lost due to breast and cervical cancers, further targeted health promotion strategies and interventions can be monitored and delivered to ensure enhanced health and well-being of Western Australian women. Target The targets for 2012-13 are listed in the table below. The 2009 National Person Years of Life Lost per 1000 population is used as the target. Improved or maintained performance will be demonstrated by a result below or equal to the target.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 109Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Rate of hospitalisations for gastroenteritis in children (0-4 years) Rationale Gastroenteritis is a common illness in infants and children. It is usually caused by viruses that infect the bowel and tends to be most common during winter months. Rotavirus gastroenteritis is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children aged up to 5 years but it is a vaccine-preventable disease. The rotavirus vaccination program was added to the Australian publicly funded schedule in July 2007. Before the rotavirus vaccination program was introduced, this virus was responsible for more than 10,000 hospitalisations of children under five years, annually placing significant burden on paediatric hospitals. Surveillance of the hospitalisation of children with gastroenteritis can support the further development and delivery of targeted intervention and prevention programs to further reduce the impact of this disease on individuals and the community, ensuring enhanced health and well-being of Western Australian children and sustainability of the public health system. Target The target for 2012-13 is less than or equal to 3.8 hospitalisations per 1,000 children under 5 years of age. The target is based on the best result achieved within the previous five years for either population group reported i.e. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal groups. Improved or maintained performance will be demonstrated by a result lower than or equal to the target. Results In 2012, the rate of non-Aboriginal children aged 0-4 years hospitalised for gastroenteritis was 4.7 per 1,000 children. This rate was almost double for Aboriginal children consistent with prior years. The rate of hospital admissions for non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal children exceeded the target.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 111Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Rate of hospitalisation for selected respiratory conditions Rationale Respiratory disease refers to a number of conditions that affect the lungs or their components. Each of these conditions is characterised by some level of impairment of the lungs in performing the essential functions of gas exchange. Respiratory disease is associated with a number of contributing factors, including poor environmental conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, substance use and previous medical conditions. Children under the age of five years are particularly susceptible to developing respiratory conditions due to low levels of childhood immunisation, parental smoking, poor nutrition, and poor environmental conditions. While there are many respiratory conditions that cause hospitalisation, some of the more common conditions that have a substantial impact on the community include acute asthma, acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis and croup. The implementation of initiatives that help prevent and better manage these respiratory conditions, such as the WA Health Asthma Model of Care, go a long way to reducing the impacts on individuals and the community, of these conditions. Surveillance of hospitalisations for these common respiratory conditions can ensure that changes over time are identified to drive improvements in the quality of care and facilitate the development and delivery of effective targeted intervention and prevention programs, thus enhancing the overall health and wellbeing of Western Australians. Target The 2012 targets, by respiratory condition, are outlined in the table below. The targets have been based on the best result recorded within the previous five years for either population group reported i.e. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 116Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Rate of hospitalisation for falls in older persons Rationale Falls occur at all ages but the frequency and severity of falls-related injury increases with age. The increase in falls as people age is associated with decreased muscle tone, strength and fitness as a result of physical inactivity. Certain medications, previous falls and predisposing medical conditions such as stroke, dementia, incontinence and visual problems can contribute to an increased risk of falls. Fall-related injury among older people is a major public health issue that can result in emergency department attendances and hospitalisation and can lead to substantial loss of independence. With the growth of the ageing population, fall-related injuries threaten to significantly increase demand on the public hospital system. By assessing the impact of falls on the public hospital system and by measuring the rate of hospitalisation for falls in older persons, effective intervention and prevention programs can be delivered. Successful interventions and prevention programs, such as the Falls Prevention Model of Care for the Older Person in Western Australia, can reduce the number and severity of falls in older persons thus, enhancing their overall health and well-being, enabling them to remain independent and productive members of their community. Target Rate of hospitalisation per 1,000 persons aged 55 years and over. A target of a 0.5 per cent per annum reduction for a sustained period for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, by 2020. Results Historically the rate of hospitalisation for falls for both population groups has increased. The rate of hospitalisation is higher for Aboriginal populations, a trend present regardless of age.

In 2012, the rate of persons aged 55 to 64 years who attended a metropolitan public hospital emergency department due to a fall was 13.8 per 1,000. In contrast the rate per 1,000 people aged 80 years and older who attended an emergency department following a fall was 96.5 per cent.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 118Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Rate of childhood dental screening Rationale Early detection and prevention of dental health problems, such as dental decay (also known as dental caries), in children can ensure better health outcomes and improved quality of life throughout the crucial childhood development years and into adult life. While dental disease is common in children, it is largely preventable through population- based interventions and individual practices such as personal oral hygiene, better diet and regular preventive dental care. The School Dental Service program ensures early identification of dental problems and, where appropriate, provides treatment. By measuring the percentage of school children enrolled in and under the care of the program, the number of children proactively involved in publicly funded dental care can be determined in order to gauge the effectiveness of the program. This in turn can help identify areas that require more focused intervention and prevention and health promotion strategies to help ensure the improved dental health and well-being of Western Australia children. Target The 2012 targets are as follows: (a) Percentage of eligible school children (pre-primary, primary and secondary) who are enrolled in the School Dental Service program and those who are currently under care: Enrolled (%) Under care (%) Pre-primary program >72 >72 Primary program >79 >79 Secondary program >72 >58 (b) Percentage of school children (all ages) who are free of dental caries when initially examined and/or re-called for examination: greater than 65 per cent. Improved or maintained performance will be demonstrated by a result higher than or equal to the target. Results In 2012, the target for primary and secondary school children enrolled and currently under care, in the School Dental Service program was achieved. The percentage of pre- primary children enrolled (54.9 per cent) and under care (54.9 per cent) has decreased and is below the target of 72 per cent. The eligible school children population is increasing and with a growth in demand, delays in the enrolment of eligible pre-primary children has occurred. New clinics to address this demand are in the process of becoming operational.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 120Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Dental health status of target clientele Rationale Oral health, including dental health is fundamental to overall health, wellbeing and quality of life with poor oral health likely to exist when general health is poor and vice versa. Dental health is influenced by many factors including nutrition, water fluoridation, hygiene, access to dental treatment, income, lifestyle factors and trauma. Dental diseases place a considerable burden on individuals and communities. While dental disease is common, it is largely preventable through population-based interventions and individual practices such as personal oral hygiene and regular preventive dental care. Costly treatment and high demand on public dental health services emphasises the need for a focus on prevention and health promotion. This indicator enables the monitoring of the dental health status of adults and children within specific age groups in order to assess the effectiveness of dental health practices, interventions and programs. Evidence-based accessible and affordable interventions that have a strong focus on dental health promotion, prevention and early identification of dental disease can then be implemented to improve the dental health of Western Australians. Target The 2012-13 target is applicable to children aged 12 years. The International Benchmark is 0.90-1.5 decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMTF). Standardised data collection protocols ensure values used are comparable to International Benchmarks. Six countries with populations and service delivery models closest to the Western Australian population and service structure were used to determine local targets. International benchmarks for 12 year olds Country DMTF Austria (2007) 1.4 Denmark (2008) 0.7 Finland (2009) 0.7 Germany (2009) 0.7 Italy (2004) 1.1 Norway (2004) 1.7 Results The number of decayed, missing or filled teeth in children has remained consistent over the past five years, producing excellent dental health status. The Western Australian result for 12 year olds was 0.69 and compared favourably with international benchmarks.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 122Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Access to dental treatment services for eligible people Rationale Oral health, including dental health is fundamental to overall health, wellbeing and quality of life with poor oral health likely to exist when general health is poor and vice versa. This makes access to timely dental treatment services critical in reducing the burden of dental disease on individuals and communities, as it can enable early detection and diagnosis with the use of preventative interventions rather than extensive restorative or emergency treatments. To facilitate the equity of access to dental healthcare for all Western Australians, dental treatment services (including both emergency care and non-emergency care) are provided through subsidised dental programs to eligible Western Australians in need. This indicator measures the level of access to these subsidised dental health services by monitoring the proportion of all eligible people receiving the services. Through measuring the use and amount of dental health services provided to eligible people, the percentage of eligible people proactively involved in publicly funded dental care can be determined. This in turn can help identify areas that require more focused intervention and prevention and health promotion strategies to help ensure the improved dental health and well-being of Western Australians with the greatest need. Target The 2012-13 targets are outlined below: (a) Eligible people who accessed Dental Health Services: greater than 17 per cent (b) Eligible people who have completed emergency or non-emergency dental treatment: Emergency 50% Non-emergency 50% Improved or maintained performance will be demonstrated by a result higher than or equal to the target. Results In 2012-13, 18 per cent of eligible adults accessed dental health services. This result exceeds the target of 17 per cent.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 124Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Average waiting times for dental services Rationale Oral health, including dental health is fundamental to overall health, wellbeing and quality of life with poor oral health likely to exist when general health is poor and vice versa. This makes access to timely dental services critical in reducing the burden of dental disease on individuals and communities, as it can enable early detection and diagnosis with the use of preventative interventions rather than extensive restorative or emergency treatments. Costly treatment and high demand on public dental health services emphasises the need for a focus on prevention and health promotion, which can be achieved through timely access to dental services. Through monitoring waiting times for access to dental health services targeted strategies can be implemented to ensure timely access to affordable dental care, which ultimately can lead to better health outcomes for Western Australians. Target The target for 2012-13 was less than 14 months. Improved or maintained performance will be demonstrated by a result lower than or equal to this target. Results In 2012-13 the average waiting time for dental services was 24 months. This result exceeds the target of less than 14 months. Dental Health Services are funded to treat approximately 20 per cent of the total number of persons eligible for subsidised dental care. The number of eligible patients waiting for non-urgent dental care is increasing, and this is associated with a growing awareness of the availability of subsidised dental health care by these patients. This is resulting in an increase in the period of time a patient must wait to receive care.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 125Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Percentage of contacts with community-based public mental health non-admitted services within seven days prior to admission to a public mental health inpatient unit Rationale Mental illness is having and increasing impact on the Australian population and is one of the leading causes of disability burden in Australia. The 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing found that an estimated 3.2 million Australians aged between 16 and 85 years had a mental disorder. It is therefore crucial to ensure effective and appropriate care is provided not only in a hospital setting but also in the community care setting. A large proportion of mental illness treatment is carried out in the community through ambulatory mental health services. The aim is to provide the best health outcomes for the individual through the provision of accessible and appropriate community mental health care. This assists with improving the management of admissions to hospital- based inpatient care for mental illness. By monitoring this indicator, the level of accessibility to community mental health services pre-admission to hospital can be gauged in order to assist in the development of effective programs and interventions. This in turn can help to improve the health and well-being of Western Australians with mental illness and ensure sustainability of the public health system. Target The target for 2012-13 was 70 per cent. This target was endorsed by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council Mental Health Standing Committee in May 2011. Results In 2012-13, 62.7 per cent of people who were admitted to a metropolitan public mental health inpatient unit, had been in contact with a community-based public mental health non-admitted service in the previous seven days.

Key Performance IndicatorsMetropolitan Health Service | Annual Report 2012-13 127Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Percentage of contacts with community-based public mental health non-admitted services within seven days post discharge from public mental health inpatient units Rationale The 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing found that an estimated 3.2 million Australians aged between 16 and 85 years had a mental disorder. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure effective and appropriate care is provided not only in a hospital setting but also in the community. A large proportion of mental illness treatment is carried out in the community through ambulatory mental health services post-discharge from hospital. Post-discharge community mental health services are critical to maintaining clinical and functional stability of patients and to reducing vulnerability in individuals with mental illness by providing support and care. This support and care can go a long way to ensuring the best health outcomes for individuals and to reducing the need for hospital readmission. Monitoring the level of accessibility to community mental health services post-admission to hospital can help in the development of effective programs and interventions. This in turn can help improve the health and wellbeing of Western Australians with mental illness and ensure sustainability of the public health system. Target In 2012 the target was 75 per cent. This target was endorsed by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council Mental Health Standing Committee in May 2011. Results In 2012, 72.5 per cent of people who were admitted to a metropolitan public mental health inpatient unit were in contact with a community-based public mental health non-admitted service within seven days following discharge. While the 2012 result was slightly below the target of 75 per cent or more contacts, a steady incline of patient contacts from 2008 continues - in line with set targets for achievement.

The 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing found that an estimated 3.2 million Australians, aged between 16 and 85 years, had a mental disorder in the 12 months prior to the survey. Therefore, it is important to ensure effective and appropriate care is provided to mental health clients not only in a hospital setting but also in the community through the provision of community mental health services. Community mental health services consist of a range of community-based services such as emergency assessment and treatment, case management, day programs, rehabilitation, psychosocial, and residential services. They aim is to provide the best health outcomes for the individual through the provision of accessible and appropriate community mental health care. Target The target for 2012-13 was $2,075 per three-month period of care for a person receiving public community mental health services. A result below the target was desirable. Results For 2012-13, the average cost to provide community-based care to a person with a mental health disorder, over a three-month period, was $2,072. This was below the target.
