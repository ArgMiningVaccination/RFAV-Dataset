Parker, PhD1; Diana Urbauer, MS1; Michael Kathleen AOCN7; Maureen Daily, BA1; and Lorenzo Cohen, PhD1 BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widespread, yet there is relatively little discussion regarding its use between oncology patients and their health care practitioners. METHODS: This multisite randomized trial examined the efficacy of an educational intervention designed to encourage oncology nurses to discuss CAM use with their patients. A total of175 nurses completed questionnaires about discussing CAM use with patients at baseline and 2 months after the intervention. Patients at baseline (N 5699) and different patients at follow-up (N 5650) completed questionnaires regarding CAM. RESULTS: At the 2-month follow-up, nurses in the intervention reported they were more likely to ask about CAM use than those in the control group (odds ratio, 4.2; P5.005). However, no significant effect was found for the percentage of patients who indicated that they were asked about CAM use (odds ratio, 2.1; P>.10). Approximately 40% of patients reported using CAM after their cancer diagnosis, yet the majority of nurses estimated that <25% of their patients were using CAM. CONCLUSIONS: CAM use in community-based on- cology patients is common and is underestimated by oncology nurses. The brief, low-intensity intervention presented herein was found to be sufficiently powerful to change nurses' perceptions of their behavior but may not have been intensive enough to yield changes that were evident to patients.

INTRODUCTION The widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among the general population in the United States has been documented to be approximately 30%.1-4Estimates of use are higher for certain subgroups such as those who are white, aged 25 years to 49 years, and those with more formal education.1CAM use among cancer patients is even higher, with estimates approaching 83%, with most patients combining CAM with conventional medical treatments.5-10 In light of these trends and because some CAM therapies have potential negative interactions with conventional medical treatment,11-14more discussion is needed between patients and health care professionals regarding their use. Although many patients believe that CAM therapies are \"natural\" and therefore harmless, it has been shown that herbal therapies and dietary supplements could decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiation,15and many health care professionals openly discourage the use of antioxidants and other natural products while patients are undergoing conven-tional medical treatment. Several studies have examined experiences of health care practitioners with and attitudes toward CAM use and found that nurses reported that patients rarely initiated conversations about CAM, 16nurses tended to have little knowledge about CAM,17,18and nurses tended not to raise the topic.18Metz19assessed the prevalence of CAM use among patients Corresponding author: Lorenzo Cohen, PhD, Department of General Oncology, Unit 0462, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, PO 301439, Houston, Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas;2Cancer Monthly, Raleigh, North Carolina;3Metro Minne- sota Community Clinical Oncology Program, St. Louis Park, Minnesota;4Central Illinois Community Clinical Oncology Program, Decatur, Illinois;5Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wisconsin;6Grand Rapids Community Clinical Oncology Program, Grand Rapids, Michigan;7Boston Medical Center Minority-based Community Clinical Oncology Program, Boston, Massachusetts.

When patients were asked rou- tine questions regarding medical history and medications, approximately 5% disclosed that they were using someform of CAM. However, when patients were askeddirectly about CAM, an additional 40% reported using CAM. Sparber et al 20found that greater than one-half of the patients enrolled in clinical trials had used CAM andthat 57% of the physicians did not ask patients about CAM usage, although patients indicated they would like to have discussed CAM therapies with their physicians.The results of these studies suggest that clinicians will fail to uncover the majority of CAM use by patients if ques- tions are not asked directly. In a survey of patients withbreast and gynecologic cancers, 21only 53.3% of CAM users had discussed CAM use with their health care team. The most common reasons were that they were not askedand the topic never came up. These data suggest that theuse of CAM therapies is frequently not discussed during oncology visits, yet patients may look to health care pro- fessionals for information regarding CAM. Additional research also has suggested that many patients fail to disclose CAM use to their health care pro- viders. 22,23In a survey of patients with breast cancer, Adler6found that approximately 54% of women being treated by a CAM practitioner did not disclose CAM use to their physicians. Reasons for this nondisclosureincluded fear or anticipation of a negative reaction fromthe physician, the perception that CAM therapies are irrelevant to conventional medical treatment, the belief that the health care professional is unable or unwilling tocontribute useful information, and a sense of protection and privacy regarding treatment choices. To our knowledge to date, few educational interven- tions in CAM have been geared toward health care profes- sionals and none were specific to the field of oncology. Kemper et al 24conducted a randomized trial of an Inter- net curriculum versus waitlist control to educate health care professionals about the risks and benefits of herbs and dietary supplements. At the time of initial follow-up, theimmediate-intervention group scored higher on knowl-edge, confidence, and communication practices regarding herbs than did the waitlist control group. The second follow-up, administered after the waitlist control groupalso underwent the training, revealed improved knowledge in the waitlist control group, but scores for confidence and communication were similar for both groups. 24 We targeted an educational intervention toward nurses who have direct clinical contact with oncology patients. Communication about CAM is included as partof a pharmacologic assessment as one of the nurse compe-tencies of the Oncology Nurse Practitioner Competencies as outlined by the Oncology Nursing Society. 25 The goal of the current study was to examine the ef- ficacy of a brief educational intervention to increase thefrequency with which oncology nurses ask their patients about their use of CAM. Secondary objectives were to examine the frequency and types of CAM use and reasonsfor using or not using CAM among cancer patients in community oncology settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants Participants were oncology nurses at Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) sites and a sample of patientsfrom each nurse's practice. Clinical nurses with regular con- tact with oncology patients at the participating CCOP site were eligible. Patients had to be aged 18 years or older,have a current diagnosis of any type of cancer, had to have received their diagnosis >1 week before, had to have com- pleted treatment <6 months before, and speak English. Patients were excluded if they had participated in the study at a previous visit; therefore, different sets of patients were recruited at baseline and at follow-up . Participants wererecruited from June 2008 through September 2011. Study Design This study used a randomized experimental design with the CCOP component site as the unit of randomization.The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer CenterCCOP Research Base is composed of 24 main sites, someof which have different components. Each participating CCOP component site was assigned to either the inter- vention or waitlist control group (see Figure 1 for studydesign and flow). The intervention and control groupswere matched based on the average number of nurses ateach CCOP component site so that the numbers of nursesin each group were similar. The study had 80% power todetect a 14.4% difference between the intervention andcontrol groups, assuming that the null rate for askingabout CAM use was 10%. 18This assumed an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.045 based on ICCs noted in the lit-erature for other diseases =clustering groups of <0.05 and recommendations for using ICCs between 0.01 and0.05 26when specific data were not available. In addition, this was calculated for 17 sites per treatment, 5 providersper site, and 4 patients per provider. All testing was2-sided, with a 5% level of statistical significance. The trial was registered in the clinical trials.gov data- base (#NCT00608933). All study participants providedinformed consent.CAM Communication in Community Settings/Parker et al Cancer October 1, 2013 3515Procedures At each participating CCOP component site, the study was introduced to the nurses by a study coordinator andinterested nurses signed the consent form and completedthe baseline provider survey. Four patients of each partici- pating nurse (baseline patients) completed a baseline patient survey. The study coordinator identified consecu-tive patients from the nurses' schedule on the day theassessment was to be completed and nurses were unawareof which patients were selected. This helped to decreasebias as the nurse was not the one selecting patients for par- ticipation. The patients were approached and consented to complete the questionnaire immediately after theirclinic visit. The CCOP component sites were then randomized to intervention and waitlist control groups. At sitesassigned to the intervention group, the nurses attended ameeting in which they watched a 20-minute video and were given a laminated card with a reminder to ask patients about CAM use and a resource list. Nursesassigned to the intervention group who did not attend themeeting were contacted by the study coordinator and informed about the study; arrangements were made forthem to complete the baseline assessment and watch the video. Nurses assigned to the intervention group received 1 follow-up e-mail approximately 2 weeks after the videointervention that reminded them to ask their patients about CAM and provided resources for obtaining CAM information At CCOP component sites that wereassigned to the waitlist control group, nurses continued usual care and no intervention took place until after the follow-up assessment. At that time, providers at these siteswere given copies of the video on a compact disc. Nurses in both the intervention and waitlist control groups completed brief follow-up questionnaires 2months after the initial assessment. Four patients caredfor by each participating nurse (follow-up patients; a dif- ferent set than baseline patients) also completed patient questionnaires. The video used as the intervention was developed by the Integrative Medicine Program at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The Figure 1. The study design is shown.Original Article 3516 Cancer October 1, 2013video includes experts in nutrition, pharmacology, law, medicine, and practitioner-patient communication. The video highlights the importance of communicating withpatients about possible interactions between CAM thera-pies and conventional treatment. Issues related to diet, herbal supplementation, and the legal and ethical obliga- tion to the patient are discussed, as well as the steps nursescan take to initiate communication with and provide guidance to their patients regarding CAM, including role- playing. The study was approved by the InstitutionalReview Board at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and each of the participating sites. Measures Provider Measures A complementary and alternative medicine providersurvey assessed the rate of asking patients about CAM use (\"How often do you ask patients about current or contem-plated use of CAM therapies?\" [not at all to every visit] and \"Of the last 5 patients you have seen, how many did you ask about CAM use? [0-5]), the estimation of what per-centage of patients use CAM, perceptions about why patients may not disclose CAM use, comfort with discus- sing CAM use with patients, and level of knowledge con-cerning a variety of CAM modalities. In the survey, weused the National Center for Complementary and Alterna- tive Medicine (NCCAM) categories of CAM use. 27The main categories were natural products (eg, herbal medi-cine, megadose mind-body practices (eg, massage therapy, spinal manipulation),movement therapies (eg, qi gong, healing touch), and whole medical systems (eg, Ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine). This questionnaire was created basedon surveys developed by Barrett et al 28and Sparber et al.20 Nurses were also asked their sex, age, race =ethnicity, how long they had practiced nursing, and their nursing role. Patient Measures A complementary and alternative medicine patient surveyincluded items about whether patients were asked by their nurses at that visit about their use of CAM, whether theyhad used CAM (using the same NCCAM categoriesdescribed earlier) before and =or after their cancer diagno- sis, reasons for using CAM (eg, to address emotional and=or spiritual concerns, help with the side effects of standard cancer therapy) or not using CAM (eg, a lack of information, physician or nurse advised against it, thera- pies are too expensive), and reasons they may not havetold their health care professionals about their use ofCAM (eg, health care professional would discourage or disapprove, use of CAM is not relevant to my medical treatment, my health care professional never asked). Thisquestionnaire also was created based on surveys developedby Barrett et al 28and Sparber et al.20 Patients also were asked to provide demographic in- formation (sex, race =ethnicity, age, and educational back- ground) and cancer- related information (current cancer diagnosis, date of diagnosis, whether their cancer had recurred). Statistical Analysis Demographic characteristics for both nurses and patients were summarized using means and frequencies. The base- line characteristics of the nurses were compared betweenthe intervention and control groups using Fisher exact testsand Student ttests when appropriate. Patient characteris- tics were compared using Fisher exact tests and analyses of variance that had terms for intervention arm and assess-ment time. There were 2 main study outcomes, each of which was assessed at baseline and 2 months after the inter- vention: 1) examining the intervention versus controlgroups with respect to the report from patients concerning whether their nurses asked them about CAM use; and 2) the nurses' self-report of their asking their patients aboutCAM. It was hypothesized that the intervention would lead to a higher CAM discussion probability than that for the control group. Generalized linear mixed models usinga logit link function to account for the binomial distribu-tion of the primary endpoints were used to assess the pri- mary objectives. The model examining patient report nested patient within provider and provider within site,whereas the model examining provider report only nested provider within site. The model had terms for treatment group, time of assessment, and treatment by time interac-tion to determine whether the report changed differentially between groups, indicating a treatment effect. Intercept was included in the model as both a fixed and randomeffect. The covariance matrix for the random interceptswas modeled as unstructured to avoid imposing any assumptions regarding correlations between the random coefficients. We also calculated descriptive statistics for thefrequency and type of CAM use among patients diagnosed with cancer, reasons for using and not using CAM, and nurses' estimates of CAM use among their patients. RESULTS A total of 175 nurses from 37 CCOP component sites participated. Approximately 97% were female and 96%were non-Hispanic white, with a mean age 45 yearsCAM Communication in Community Settings/Parker et al Cancer October 1, 2013 3517(range, 24 years-66 years) (Table 1). Approximately 82% were staff nurses and 10% were nurse practitioners. Six- teen nurses dropped out between baseline and follow-up, primarily because they either no longer worked at theinstitution or were out on leave when the follow-up was conducted. A total of 1349 patients participated (699 patients at baseline and 650 patients at the time of follow-up).Patients were 66% female and 87% non-Hispanic white, with mean age 59 years (range, 19 years-91 years). Approximately 33% of the patients had completed collegeor had advanced degrees. The most common cancers were breast (33%), gastrointestinal (17%), and lung (12%) and 26% of patients had experienced a cancer recurrence(Table 2). Compared with nurses in the waitlist control group, nurses in the intervention group were significantly morelikely to report that they asked patients about CAM use atthe time of follow-up [ P5.005]), these results should be interpreted with caution given thewide range of the 95% CI (Fig. 2). Nurses in the interven- tion group reported that they asked more of their last 5 patients about CAM use than did those in the controlgroup (mean difference, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.24-1.15 [P5.003]) (Fig. 3). However, there was no significantintervention effect noted for the percentage of patients in the clinic who indicated that they were asked by their nurses about CAM use at their follow-up visit (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.62-7.28 [ P>.10]) (Fig. 4). It is important to note that there were no differences at baseline between nurses in the intervention and control groups with regard to how comfortable they were discussing CAM withpatients ( P5.22) but at the time of follow-up, nurses in the intervention group indicated they were more comfort- able discussing CAM than those in the control group (P5. 01) (Fig. 5). At baseline, 18% of the patients of the nurses in the intervention group and 26% of the patients of the nurses in the control group reported that they initiated a conver-sation with their health care practitioners about CAM. At the time of follow-up, 18% of the patients of the nurses in the intervention group and 22% of the patients of thenurses in the control group reported initiating a conversa-tion about CAM use. The difference from baseline was not found to be statistically significantly different between the intervention and control groups (OR, 1.32; 95% CI,0.76-2.30 [ P5.3258]). Approximately 64% of nurses estimated that between 1% and 25% of their patients used CAM, andonly 24% estimated between 26% and 50% of their patients used CAM. Nevertheless, 40% of patientsTABLE 1.

Among those who used CAM, the most common reasons fordoing so were that CAM was perceived to be beneficial(70%), to address the emotional and spiritual aspects of cancer (62%), to boost the immune system (52%), and to help with the side effects of treatment (40%). Amongthose who did not use CAM, the most common reasons for not doing so were a lack of available information (54%) and skepticism regarding using those therapies(28%). Among CAM users, the most common modalitieson the survey that were used before cancer diagnosis were manipulative and body-based practices (31%), mind andbody practices (13%), and natural products (11%) and themost common modalities used during cancer treatment were natural products (9%), mind and body practices (7%), and manipulative and body-based practices (6%).

This extremely brief interven- tion significantly improved how often nurses reported ask- ing about CAM use, but not how often patients reportedthat their nurses asked about CAM use, although the OR of 2.1 indicated a trend toward patients reporting increased CAM-related discussions. In addition, at the time offollow-up, the nurses in the intervention group reportedthey were more comfortable discussing CAM with patients whereas there were no differences noted between groups at baseline before the intervention. These results suggest thatthis brief, low-intensity intervention was sufficiently power- ful to change nurses' perceptions of their behavior but may not have been intensive enough to yield changes that wereevident to patients in the clinic. It is possible that the nurseswere more aware of the value of discussing CAM use and more comfortable with their knowledge of the topic, but need more training or role-playing opportunities to practice actually introducing the topic within the real flow of patientcare. In addition, it is important to supplement educational interventions with procedural or practice guidelines that mandate that asking about CAM use is part of the nursingduties when discussing medications and other related issues.This is consistent with the guidelines developed by the On- cology Nursing Society. 25It is also important to develop a comprehensive approach to changing key aspects of cancercare delivery. The educational targets may need to include physicians, patients, and families to improve both patient knowledge related to CAM use and their skills regardingcommunicating effectively with their health care team.

BL indicates baseline; FU, follow-up.Original Article 3520 Cancer October 1, 2013Data from the current study indicate that CAM use in community-based oncology patients remains high and that, despite the vast literature on this topic, CAM use byindividual patients remains underestimated by oncologynurses involved in their care. 10,29Clearly, additional interventions are necessary to improve communication between nurses and other members of the health careteam and patients regarding CAM use. In addition to avoiding potential interactions with chemotherapy or other treatment modalities, enhancing communicationabout CAM use may also improve communication between the health care practitioner and the patient by demonstrat- ing care and concern for the patients and providing an op-portunity for patients to discuss how they are coping with their cancer, identifying and addressing the psychosocial needs of the patient, and poten tially enhancing the patient- centered nature of the interaction. 30-32Enhancing educa- tion and communication about CAM may also result in improved patient care by increasing the use of evidenced- based CAM practices that have been shown to improvesymptom control and clinical outcomes. 33 The results of the current study provide unique in- formation regarding CAM use in community oncologysettings and found that 40% of community oncology patients reported using CAM after their cancer diagnosis. These results generally resemble the findings from aca-demic medical centers, 7-9as well as data from the National Health Interview Survey5concerning the wide- spread use of CAM among patients with cancer, but are somewhat lower than those reported in recent studies.10,29 These lower numbers may reflect differences in the CAM modalities included. The current study used NCCAM categories and did not include prayer or psychotherapy,which have been included in some studies. It is also possi- ble that there may have been differences in how nurses and patients thought about and characterized what CAMincluded, despite the finding that we included the NCCAM categories of CAM on the cover page of both the nurse and patient surveys. 34An important strength of the current study was that it was conducted in communityclinics throughout the United States and represented a diverse cancer population in terms of demographic and cancer characteristics. There are several limitations to the current study. The intervention was extremely br ief and required few resources for implementation. Although a more intensive interven-tion might have produced greater changes in behavior, we opted for a brief, easy-to-imple ment intervention to encour- age participation and allow for ease of implementationacross multiple community settings. The intervention wasalso limited to nurses and did not include other members of the health care team. We focused on nurses because typically they are the practit ioners who obtain information regarding the medical history and medication use and because this is recommended within the scope of practice by the Oncology Nurse Practitioner Competencies publishedby the Oncology Nursing Society. 25However, an interven- tion aimed at physicians might provide more robust results. All the assessments were subjective in nature and this increases the possibility that nurses in the intervention group overreported their asking behavior. However, given that the study coordinators at each site were completely in- dependent of the investigators who designed and proposed the study, there was little incentive for nurses to overreport to please the investigators. N onetheless, it is possible that completing a questionnaire about CAM use and watching t h ev i d e om a yh a v eh e i g h t e n e da w a r e n e s sa b o u tC A Ma n d prompted nurses to report more favorably on their prac- tices. A study design that included audio recordings of themedical visit would provide more accurate reports of what was discussed, and future studies should consider adding this important component. We were not able to systemati- cally record the number of nurses who refused participation at each site; however, we do not expect this number to be significantly different between the intervention and control sites. The follow-up period was also quite short and stronger effects could have emerged over time. However, we expected to observe the biggest practice change early in the follow-up period with potential dampening of the effect over time. Finally, there was a n underrepresentation of mi- nority groups within the nurse population, although the racial composition of the nurses was reflective of that of thenurses employed at the participating CCOP sites. Overall, the results of the current study demon- strated that even a very brief (20 minutes) intervention significantly improved how often nurses reported askingpatients about their use of CAM. However, reports by the patients of the nurses did not reflect this change in com- munication.
