Carlson, MD This is being written the week of March 9th\u2014the week, when, to quote the headlines, America shut down. For the next few months at least, we must hunker down. Don't travel, socialize at a distance if at all, and if there is anything that can be done remotely, do it\u2014including teaching and seeing patients. We won't be able to go to plays, movies, see a sports event, or attend a concert, medical meeting, book club, marathon or parade. Prescient or anxious citizens have stocked up on toilet paper, macaroni and cheese, and anything that looks like it sanitizes. Leadership everywhere, including our own AACAP staff and executive com-mittee have spent inordinate amounts of time trying to figure out what is best for its constituency and the public (in our case at AACAP, what is best for our members, and the children and families we serve). This is like a horror movie and as one who avoids horror movies when she can, I'd like to turn this one off. If one more authority tells me to wash my hands for 20 seconds (I can do that) and not touch my face (I'm doomed), I will implode. I'm sincerely hoping that by the time this article is published in the March/April edition of AACAP News, there will be a light at the end of what may be a dark tunnel\u2014the length of which is unknown. Having no particular insights or words of wisdom on this crisis, however, I will do what I find helpful when things are topsy-turvy and that is to create as much normalcy as I can. Let me tell you, then, where my \"Emotion Dysregulation-Coming Together to Treat the Sickest Kids\" initiative is. First, I am really pleased that this topic has resonated with so many child and adolescent psychiatrists. I'm not pleased that we have the problem. Dysregulated, explosive children present complicated diagnostic and treatment challenges. But I feel validated that I'm not the only one who sees this as an important issue. For those of you who attended the annual meeting, thank you for your comments! The first year goals for my presidency and my presidential Task Force on Emotion Dysregulation in Children are to develop or find 1) a consistent label for the explosive behaviors in question, of which there are a myriad right now; 2) the best ways to measure frequency, severity and duration since we can't assess treatment or outcome without useful, reliable and valid measures; 3) a way to code these behaviors for diagnostic purposes. As some of you know, I've been interested in member feedback about some of these issues and, with the help of the AACAP staff, I have done a survey of doctors who have attended conferences where I have presented. (Epidemiologists\u2014you will need to look the other way right now). However, based on about 400 mostly child and adolescent psychiatrists (a few psy-chologists and pediatrician attendees have weighed in), the topic of children with outbursts is an important part of your practice for about 80% of you. Given a choice of terms to call the episodes, the rank order from most to least popular is: 1-outbursts; 2-tantrums; 3-meltdowns; 4-rages; 5-mood swings; 6-manic episodes. Most the respondents wanted a rating scale of between 10-15 items. Frequency and duration of outbursts were dimen-sions respondents wanted to have addressed. However, when it came to gauging whether or not the child was getting worse, the most common dimen-sion selected was increase in aggressive behavior. For my part, I think assessment instruments need to address not only how the child feels (e.g., dysphoric or irritable), but what he or she does with that feeling (mutter under breath, curse out loud, slam doors, turn over desks, attack peers and/or adults). The latter behaviors are what really drive treatment seeking. Frequency is important but one can tolerate a frequently unpleasant mood more easily than even an occa-sionally severely aggressive behavior. In terms of satisfaction with our current options for diagnosing children with outbursts, most of you felt that what we have is OK, but that the territory isn't adequately covered. Given a choice of whether you wanted another diagno-sis or whether you wanted to have the option of adding a modifier like \"with explosive outbursts\", or \"with irritabil-ity\", to current diagnoses (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with explo-sive outbursts, or obsessive compulsive disorder with explosive outbursts), most of you said \"both\". It is of interest to me that the ICD 11 committee decided to use \"oppositional defiant disorder, irrita-ble subtype\" instead of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The introduction of the subtype concept is consistent with what I've thought about. In coming editions of AACAP News, I will be sharing with you how the initia-tive is progressing. I am hopeful that the dysregulation caused by COVID-19 will be reversible before long and that all of us stay safe and healthy. m Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD AACAP President AACAP Coronavirus Resources NEW! Check out AACAP's new section Resources for Helping Kids and Parents Cope Amidst COVID-19 . AACAP's Coronavirus Resource Library contains updated resources for parents, patients, and clinicians to help with the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19). COLUMNS74 AA CAP NEWSPresident's Email Message to Members Sent April 7, 2020 to All AACAP Members Dear AACAP Colleagues, I feel like I'm writing from the middle of a horror movie, which, were I watching it, I'd turn off. I've always hidden my eyes from scary parts of movies. However, we can't hide our eyes from this horror. We can't turn it off. I live on Long Island. Three of my executive committee friends and colleagues live in New York City and the other is holed up in San Francisco. This isn't just my lane, it's my highway and land on both sides of it! We've done several things to help the membership navigate the changing COVID-19 environment: We created AACAP's Coronavirus Resource Library . This includes resources for parents, patients, and clini- cians to help with the impact of the coronavirus. We're constantly adding to the library so be sure to keep checking AACAP's homepage for the latest information. Please know we're here to help, and we understand how important it is that you stay connected to AACAP services, products, and programs. At the National Office, our dedicated AACAP staff are continuing to work diligently to meet your needs. To support public health efforts and keep our team safe and healthy, we've transitioned to a remote work environment and asked staff who can work from home to do so. We'll continue to work hard to deliver the services, products, and programs you depend on, and communicate frequent updates on those efforts. And there are some positive things: Reconnecting with people who write to me out of the blue to ask if I'm OK. Similarly, I started writing to people out of the blue just to say \"hello.\" This is such a valuable and reaffirming thing to do. In the category of lemonade from lemons, we're learning a new way of dealing with our patients. We may learn ways that extend our resources and our abilities that we can use when this is over. We should keep track of what's useful and innovative and what's not. Finally, we continue to learn the value of toilet paper and soap. It's funny the things we value in times of crisis. Plus, the cartoons and jokes are hilarious! We need laughter now more than ever. Just know that you're not alone, that we'll get through this, and that your professional home is doing what we can to keep you connected. Be well and stay safe, Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD AACAP PresidentCOLUMNS MARCH/APRIL 2020 75 Cathryn A. Galanter, MD It gives me great pleasure to update our members about some of the recent activities taking place at AACAP, and in particular, under the Executive Council (EC). First, a brief overview of the EC. The EC serves in an advisory capacity to the President and Council and includes the President (Gabrielle Carlson, MD), President Elect (Warren Ng, MD), Secretary (Cathryn Galanter, MD), Treasurer (Bennett Leventhal, MD) and Chair of the Assembly (Melvin Oatis, MD). The EC meets in person every other month, with conference calls on the alternating months. Each EC serves together for two years starting at the close of the Annual Meeting. Second, I wanted to share with you several updates from AACAP that have taken place in the last four months since the Annual Meeting in October. Presidential Taskforce on the Crisis in Recruitment AACAP has renewed the Presidential Taskforce on the Crisis in Recruitment, now in it's second phase. In case you do not know the backstory, in April 2018, in response to the sharp downturn in the numbers of matched child and adoles-cent psychiatry fellows, the continuing pattern that our CAP Fellowships do not fill, the workforce crisis and the increas-ing number of applicants for general psychiatry residencies, the members of the AACAP Assembly approved a motion entitled \"Addressing the Serious Shortage of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists\" recommending the forma-tion of an AACAP Council Taskforce on the Crisis in Recruitment. In June 2018, Council under the leadership of Past President Karen Dineen Wagner, MD, PhD, approved the motion for a Taskforce to develop recommendations for creating an additional pathway/track into the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. The TF was chaired by Lisa Cullins, MD and included John Walkup, MD, Cathryn Galanter, MD, and Carmen Thornton as AACAP Staff Liaison. We investigated mechanisms for devel- oping a new program. This included eliciting input from and liaising with multiple stakeholders and organiza-tions including American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training (AADPRT), the American Psychiatric Association (APA), American Academy of Directors of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AADCAP), the American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and most importantly, our members. Because it is crucial that the training program be fully accredited and for graduates to board eligible, the ACGME and ABPN were especially important for collaboration. Discussions revealed a great deal of support, but also some concerns, for example that an abbreviated program might compromise education. The TF identified procedural obstacles. One, that the ACGME only considers a new residency if there are at least 50 programs of 200 residents, a scale far greater than what the Task Force members had envisioned for a pilot program. In June 2019, the Council heard the TF's recommendations. Later in 2019, Gaye Carlson, MD, AACAP's current president, appointed a new TF to be led by Jeffrey Hunt MD and include Sandra DeJong, MD, Mary-Margaret Gleason, MD, Sansea Jacobson, MD, Richard Martini, MD, Cynthia Santos, MD, Erica Shoemaker, MD, and John Walkup, MD. The TF will focus on developing a proposal for the training pathway and will tackle such difficult questions as to whether the training will be five, four or three year, whether it will result in board eligibility for just child and adolescent psychiatry or general psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry, and how to build consensus among our members and our collaborating organizations on this train-ing pathway. They will also work with ACGME and ABPN and the American Board of Medical Specialties, to ensure that the program will result in needed certification and accreditation. Presidential Working Group on Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Dr. Carlson appointed a Presidential Working Group (PWG) on the Health Services and Resources Administration (HRSA) Workforce Report. The PWG was charged with \"determining fur-ther actions needed in response to HRSA's Behavioral Health Workforce Projection.\" The PWG was chaired by Bennett Leventhal, MD, and also included Mark Olfson, MD, Wun Jung Kim, MD, and Carmen Thornton, Director, Research, Training & Education, as the AACAP Staff Liaison. For those of you unfamiliar with the HRSA report, in the end of 2018, directed by the Congress, the NCHWA/HRSA issued a report, \"Behavioral Health Workforce Projections, 2016 - 2030.\" The report projected a national undersupply of general psychiatrists and an oversupply of child and adolescent psychiatrists by 2030. These projections were in conflict with AACAP's past data and feedback from our members and patients that there is significant need for more child and adolescent psychiatrists. AACAP responded by reaching out to HRSA both alone, and with collaborat-ing organizations. The Working Group carefully reviewed the HRSA data as well as other materials. They devel-oped a number of recommendations to address both the HRSA report and data about the workforce shortage going forward. Their recommendations fell into four categories, 1. Scientific/Data-Driven Approaches 2. Communication Strategies and Actions 3. Political Secretary's Report 76 AA CAP NEWSStrategies and Actions 4. Development and/or Reinforcement of Strategic Alliances. Their recommendations will be further reviewed by AACAP's President along with her advisors and Council, so that they can make risk-and cost-benefit assessments for each recom-mendation to determine what is feasible and in the best interest of our members and patients. AACAP and the Association Advocating on Our Behalf with the Government Since October, both AACAP and the American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry have been at work signing on bills on behalf of children's mental health. When AACAP signs on to a bill or Amicus brief, the docu-ment is carefully reviewed by AACAP members with content expertise, often from the Advocacy or Children and the Law Committees, AACAP members with content expertise, and AACAP staff from Legislative Affairs. With their support, AACAP's EC makes the decision whether AACAP or The Association should also support the bill. As an example, in December 2019, the Association signed on to a letter with 19 other medical and mental health organizations to House and Senate in support of the \"Children and Media Research Advancement Act (CAMRA)\" H.R. 1367 . Also in December, the Association and the Mental Health Liaison Group joined a sign-on letter with 39 other medical and mental health organizations, in sup-port of \"Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act of 2019\" (H.R. 4861) . The letter was sent to the representa-tives who were sponsoring the bill. From October to January, AACAP signed on to 15 bills. AACAP Products The EC along with The Council reviews many of AACAP's products developed by our Committees. A recent example is the new Anxiety Disorders: Parent's Medication Guide . The Parent Med Guides are developed in collaboration with the APA by members of the Psychopharmacology Committee along with input from the Consumer Issues Committee and members with content area expertise. If you have not yet seen the new Med Guide, you should defi-nitely take a look! Med Guides can be very helpful resource for educating fami-lies and can be found on the AACAP website or through this link: https://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/ AACAP/docs/resource_centers/resources/med_guides/anxiety-parents-medication-guide.pdf These are just a few updates on the work of your EC, Council, and the Academy as of the end of February. It is a pleasure and an honor to serve our president in the interest of our members and the children and family we treat. m Warm Regards, Cathryn A. Galanter, MD AACAP SecretaryCOLUMNS Call for Self-Nominations - AACAP Delegation to AMA Interested AACAP members who are also current members of the American Medical Association (AMA) may self-nomi-nate for future openings on AACAP's Delegation to AMA. At present, AACAP enjoys two Delegate slots in the AMA House of Delegates (HOD), as well as two Alternate Delegate posi-tions. The AMA HOD meets yearly in Chicago, IL, in June and at a changing location in November of each year. Ability to travel for up to 6 days in June and 5 days in November each year is required. Former or current leadership service in a state medical society to the AMA HOD or one of AMA's special sections, councils, or Assemblies, such as the Medical Student Section (MSS), Resident Fellows Section (RFS), or Young Physicians Section (YPS) would be highly advanta-geous to AACAP. Members of AACAP's delegation must also actively participate in the AMA Psychiatry Section Council at the AMA HOD Annual and Interim meetings, as well as in preparation for each meeting during the year.AACAP provides travel reimbursement up to established limits for committee members upon timely filing of expense vouchers and receipts. In addition to the AMA HOD, AACAP may have up to two Delegates to YPS. A Stubblefield RFS Delegate is also chosen under a separate solicitation, which will be advertised later in 2020 for a position opening after June 2021. Detailed further information is available at: https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2019-11/hod-refer - ence-manual.pdf Letters of interest and a current CV should be addressed to Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD, President, and be delivered by June 30, 2020, for future consideration, to: gcarlson@aacap.org . m MARCH/APRIL 2020 77COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS PrideCAPA COMMITTEE The AACAP affiliate organization formerly known as the Lesbian and Gay Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Association (LAGCAPA) is proud to officially unveil our new, more inclusive name\u2014 PrideCAPA \u2014a name which better represents our diverse members and the patients and fami-lies whom we serve. P rideCAPA was founded in 1990 by a pioneering group of child and adolescent psychiatrists dedicated to meeting the mental health care needs of sexual minority youth and supporting LGBTQ colleagues and train-ees. P rideCAPA founders, with AACAP leadership, established the AACAP Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Issues Committee in 1990. Since then, P rideCAPA has grown to include over 150 members who have played a pivotal role in developing AACAP posi-tion statements on sexual orientation, gender identity, and civil rights, and drafting the AACAP sexual orientation discrimination policy, among numer-ous other accomplishments. Moving forward, PrideCAPA will continue sup- porting our LGBTQ youth and families, fighting against discrimination, and pro-viding community for our LGBTQ child and adolescent psychiatrists. Join P rideCAPA for our yearly busi- ness meeting held during the AACAP Annual Meeting in San Francisco this year, or stop for a cocktail during our social reception open to members and non-members alike. Visit our website at PrideCAPA.org or email PrideCAPA Membership@gmail.com for more information on how to get involved! m78 AA CAP NEWS COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONSMEDIA COMMITTEE Social Media and Depression In only a short time, social media (SM) has transformed the lives of adoles-cents. Facebook was born in 2004, and Twitter in 2006, but it was with the accessibility that came with the iPhone, released in 2007, that the age of SM truly began. Data from 2019 indicates that 84 percent of teens own a smartphone, and 63 percent use SM daily for an average of two hours. 1 The explosion of SM use paralleled a dramatic increase in depression and suicidality. Rates of severe depression, hospitalization for suicidal thoughts, and completed suicide among adolescents have nearly doubled in recent years. What is the relationship between SM use and depression? Empirical evidence sug - gesting that SM habits and experiences affect mental health is fairly strong, but the relationship is complex. Teens who spend the most time on SM are at the highest risk for depression, but this isn't always true of their time on SM. Some studies show that time on SM is related to depression, others show no such relationship or even an inverse one. 2 However, research more consistently shows that certain types of use and experiences are risky, while others can be protective. SM can be an excellent platform for adolescents to strengthen existing friendships and make new ones. Some minority and LGBT teens, as well as those with niche interests, struggle to connect with like-minded peers in person. For them, SM may be a lifeline to socialize and avoid loneliness. Teens who have strong social sup- port on-and-offline tend to assign less importance to SM experiences, use SM Paul Weigle, MD in an active manner (e.g., posting and commenting), and enjoy more positive interactions online. For these youth, time spent on SM can actually improve self-esteem and protect against depression. However, teenagers with few friends who place more importance on their online interactions and who use SM pas-sively (reading but not contributing) have more negative interactions online. They tend to feel lonelier the more time they spend on SM, and are at significantly higher risk for depression. It seems that on SM, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Individual characteristics put some teens at particularly high risk for worsen-ing mood on SM. Teens high in social comparison (i.e., those who judge themselves depending on how they compare to peers) tend to be deceived by the idealized SM pages of peers; they believe these accurately represent their peers' lives. Those who become anxious that they might be missing the posi-tive experiences their peers are having (a.k.a., fear of missing out) are signifi-cantly more likely to experience negative effects of using social media including worsening depression. Certain teens gravitate towards high- risk behaviors on social media. Youth who sext (post or send naked photos of themselves), are also at greater risk. This is especially true of LGBT youth and girls who send pictures of themselves outside of a preexisting romantic relationship (typically as an attempt to start a new one), as they are most likely to have the picture forwarded to others and to feel worse afterwards. Perhaps the highest risk of online interaction is cyberbully-ing; involvement as a perpetrator, victim, or both, is related to a powerful increase in the risk for depression and suicidality. Using SM in the bedroom can often lead to insomnia, itself a strong risk factor for depression. Depressed and anxious youth seem particularly susceptible to negative effects of SM. Not only are they more likely to report being ignored, criticized, or attacked online, they are more likely to feel left out and use SM as a tool to avoid their real-world problems; experi-ences which in turn may exacerbate their illness. Of particular concern is online discussion of depression and suicidal - ity, which tends to result in worsening symptoms over time. Despite this, adolescents with internalizing problems value SM significantly more-so than their peers as a way to socialize, express themselves, or get help for their prob-lems. Asynchronous, effortless, online communications may feel less challeng-ing than in-person interactions, making them particularly attractive to depressed and anxious youth. Psychiatrists should know that SM interactions can powerfully affect adolescents' well-being, for good and for ill. The nature of the user and their online experiences determine if it will lead to positive or negative outcomes. Youth who use SM in moderation, and MARCH/APRIL 2020 79 COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CHILD & ADOLESCENT SERVICE INTENSITY INSTRUMENT For more information on CASII, contact the Clinical Practice Program Manager at clinical@aacap.org.www.aacap.org/CASIIin combination with real-world social- izing and sufficient structured time for sleep, schoolwork, chores, family time, and exercise, enjoy the greatest well-being. Unfortunately, our most vulnerable patients, those suffering from depression, are often at the greatest risk for unhealthy SM experiences, which worsen their mood and increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Psychiatrists must take special care to evaluate the impact that SM habits and experiences have on the well-being of our patients with depression, keeping in mind both opportunities and pitfalls. We must take the time to discuss ways to minimize risk and foster healthy behav-iors on SM. We should advise parents to guide and supervise their children's, tweens', and youth's SM, especially for those suffering from depression, to instill health habits and minimize toxic interactions. Sometimes teens avoid coming to parents in response to an online crisis for fear of their phone being confiscated. It may be helpful for parents and teens to have a standing agreement that this will not happen. Phone and computer screens should not be allowed in bedrooms or behind closed doors and should charge in the parent's bedroom at night. With a bit of knowledge about SM, we can help our patients embrace the benefits their screens offer and mini-mize their drawbacks. m References 1. R ideout V.

Though they provide great advances in communication, safety, and ease of access, there is concern that they have led to a sharp rise in \"screen time\" for clinicians, rather than time spent with patients. This may be especially true in psychiatry, where we rely far more on narrative and interpretation, than on laboratory values and other \"objective\" diagnostics. In recent years, the KLAS Arch Collaborative has partnered with health-care organizations across the country to deepen our understanding of clinician satisfaction with EMRs. A significant number of psychiatrists were included in this group, and KLAS has been willing to partner with the AACAP Health IT Committee on the analysis of this data. As a new AACAP Committee, the AACAP Health IT Committee (HIT) posed some exploratory questions to KLAS to assess satisfaction within psychiatry and child psychiatry. The HIT Committee is committed to devel - oping resources to ensure AACAP Members are not just passive consumers of technology, but actively engaged in important questions of how we use tech-nology to advance patient care. As such, assessment of our current state in EMRs is an important starting point. Overall, psychiatrists report near-average satisfaction among physicians in general. Figure 1 shows that general psychiatrists were in the 45th percentile, and child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) were in the 53rd percentile (each line denotes a specialty). Both groups reported below-average rates of burnout, and high satisfaction and personal fulfillment from their clinical work. There is a slight trend that those at organizations using Epic as their EMR report greater efficiency and satisfaction, though it is important Rabindra Tambyraja, MD, MBA to note the survey does not control for other organizational factors. Perhaps the most interesting specific finding is that psychiatrists, both General and CAP, report much lower-than-average rates of personalization. This includes activities such as designing documentation templates for speed note-writing (such as a biopsychosocial framework), ordering sets to improve consistency (psychotropic monitoring labs, or 90-day stimulant prescriptions), and designing filters/views to ease chart review activities. Of further note, Figure 2 shows that those who had personal - ized their EMR experience reported greater satisfaction (though the survey is not designed to assess statistical signifi-cance of this). The latter finding makes sense, since (as should be clear to all psychiatrists) a greater sense of agency over one's work environment should contribute to greater satisfaction. So, how to make use of this finding to improve our professional satisfaction? First, start from the realization that many EMRs are not designed for the typi-cal workflow of a psychiatrist, but the tools are there. For those of us working in larger organizations, you most likely have a fellow physician in informat-ics at your organization. This is usually a chief medical information officer (CMIO), medical director of informatics, or other similar title. Reach out to this person, and tell them you'd like to be involved in improving the EMR experi-ence for yourself and your colleagues. Figure 1.

Data from all participant organizations who measured psychiatrist participants. Be prepared for a few rounds of \"that's close, but not quite what I need...\" At smaller organizations, you may need to contact your EMR vendor directly, and ask them to share what has helped other practices as well. Time spent helping them understand your clinical work, and how the EMR can best support safe efficient practice, will be a major source of satisfaction. Of course, feel free to reach out to any members of the AACAP HIT Committee with questions too. As AACAP's \"nerds in residence\", we are happy to help. mFigure 2. EHR Satisfaction by adoption or non-adoption of Personalization features Dr. Rabindra is the Chief Medical Information Officer for Children's Minnesota. His primary work focuses on the use of technology to help all children and families achieve optimum health. Clinically, he is a practicing child psychiatrist with expertise in mental health challenges in medically ill patients. He primarily provides consultation services to children and families on the inpatient units.Nancy A. Roeske, MD Submitted by Cyrus E. Adams, MD My freshman summer at Indiana University, I was fortunate to be selected as Dr. Nancy A. Roeske's summer paid extern. At the end of the summer, she said I could interview a child by myself while she watched through a mirror. When I went to the waiting room, he refused to budge. I sat down on the floor by him until he finally said \"OK I'll go.\" I had found my calling. Paul Adams, MD Submitted by Cyrus E. Adams, MD At Louisville, Paul Adams was the residency training director. When I told him I wanted to explore child fellowships, he convinced me to apply to UCLA. The multitude of faculty who guided me there included Cantwell, Carlson, Tanguay and Tarjan among many others. Fifteen years ago, I came home to work for the hospital where I was born and am proud to be a small part of the new Indiana University psychiatry residency at Vincennes. Also, we recently lost Dr. Leah Dickstein who introduced me to college mental health care, with which I still collaborate with the junior college I attended. Lois Flaherty, MD Submitted by Bettina Bernstein, DO This letter is to honor my mentor, Dr. Lois Flaherty who is an incredible inspiration; the embodiment of all that I strive to be as a child and adolescent psychiatrist professionally as well as personally. Lois has always provided the encouragement and support to listen without judging when that was needed, both when professional and personal challenges arose. Lois continues to be a wonderful role model of how to find the work-life balance; continuing to teach and mentor trainees while finding the time to spend with family and friends including her grandchildren! I thank Lois for being a fantastic mentor and role model as well as a wonderful friend! Honor Your Mentor Each year in the March/April issue of AACAP News , we take the time to honor our mentors and say thank you to those who have made a significant difference in our professional and personal lives. HONOR YOUR MENTOR 82 AA CAP NEWSAvron Kriechman, MD Submitted by Ramnarine Boodoo, MD One of my greatest experiences with mentorship was when I met and was guided by Dr. Avron \"Avi\" Kriechman at the University of New Mexico. Open with his prodigious knowledge, he was neither intimidating nor self-serving. His gratification came from seeing a student develop. Avi didn't just talk about the way, he showed it. I can still turn to him today. Perhaps his greatest gift, and the gift of all other mentors in my life, was the gift of courage to pursue Truth, and to stand up for Truth even while knowing the often unpleasant consequences of doing so. Lisa Ruiz, MD Submitted by Janie Cao, MD, MPH I met Dr. Lisa Ruiz as a third-year medical student on my child psychiatry rotation. She not only taught me about child psychiatry but perhaps more importantly, she empowered me as a female physician-to-be and inspired me to stay true to my values. While on her team, she treated me as an equal participant and encouraged me to advocate for the grades that I deserved. She would put patients first even when it was inconvenient, scary, and required personal sacrifice. I would like to honor Dr. Lisa Ruiz\u2014she is a one-of-a-kind role model. Doug Kramer, MD, MS Submitted by Meg Cary, MD, MPH With Doug, mentorship is what arises in the relationship. He co-creates a space for collaboratively sharing curiosities, raising questions, and reflecting on observations. He once offered, \"I hope you were able to wander around those thoughts and interior journeys without any fences or trespassing signs.\" Thank you, Doug, for scaling fences and venturing into uncertainty with me as I figure out this journey of being a family psychiatrist. Patrick Driscoll, MD Submitted by Shinny-yi Chou Dr. Patrick Driscoll has been promoting the importance of thinking outside the current models of care and consider patients' welfare and our own passions. His passion for psychodynamic psychotherapy through a contemporary lens is refreshing in an environment where biological psychiatry is considered the gold standard. He speaks sincerely of his own career development and shares his experiences within reservations and is truly an important mentor for our development as well-rounded psychiatrists. HONOR YOUR MENTOR MARCH/APRIL 2020 83Sansea Jacobson, MD Submitted by Shinny-yi Chou Dr. Sansea Jacobson has been a great source of support and a role model over the years. Her passion for trainee well-being has generated national momentum and fueled residents and fellows within our institution to follow in her footsteps of improving our working and learning environments. She is candid and honest in her advice and never imposes her own agenda on our career explorations and developments. She truly has our best interest in mind and is a great residency mom for us all. Suzie Nelson, MD Submitted by William Clark, MD Dr. Suzie Nelson has supported my interest and education in child & adolescent psychiatry throughout my residency and fellowship experience at Wright State University. Her mentorship encouraged my pursuit of child & adolescent psychiatry and her support and leadership has made me a better physician leader. Dr. Nelson has fostered areas of interest by creating new clinical and educational opportunities throughout my fellowship experience. I am extremely lucky to have had such an amazing mentor. I expect her example will lead me for years to come. Don Ehrman, PhD Submitted by Maria Daehler, MD I had the pleasure of working with Don Ehrman, PhD, now 101 years old, as a solo practitioner among psychiatrists and psychologists for the past 15+ years in Palo Alto, California. About 10 of us meet weekly to discuss cases and address the standard business issues of sharing office space together. Don has the gift of sitting quietly, listening to the many conversations from clinicians, and then offering the shortest, most succinct, and usually group process interpretation possible. We hang on his comments and are stretched by his thought provoking statements. Don quit driving to work when he turned 100, so I now drive to his place. There have been many wonderful mentors in my life, and at 55 I appreciate from Don Ehrman that there is still much to learn and live! Peter B. Henderson, MD and Richard L. Cohen, MD Submitted by Mina Dulcan I am fortunate to have had many mentors and role models, but the two who stand out are Peter B. Henderson, MD, and Richard L. Cohen, MD. In the mid-1970's at the University of Pittsburgh/WPIC, Peter and Dick created a unique GME model of early-entry to CAP and developmentally and family-focused integrated training with adults and youth. Peter, lost too soon to cancer, introduced me to AACAP and AADPRT and how to navigate and succeed in national organizations. Dick provided the model and guidance for my first authored/edited book\u2014a text on education in CAP. HONOR YOUR MENTOR 84 AA CAP NEWSRichard Martini, MD Submitted by Lisa Giles, MD I first met Dr. Rich Martini at an annual AACAP meeting during my final months of triple board residency. In the 13 years since that time, I have had the opportunity to work alongside Dr. Martini in building an inpatient and outpatient consultation-liaison service in my home state of Utah. From the beginning, he partnered with me in writing review articles and connecting me to like-minded colleagues in AACAP. His mentorship has made the dream of an academic career centered on pediatric consultation-liaison a reality. Elizabeth Reeve, MD Submitted by Brittany Hammond, DO Elizabeth Reeve, MD, is a mentor who values education along with the well-being of her patients and residents. Her psychiatric expertise is coupled with an uncanny ability to communicate with patients and their families. When patients, parents, and trainees feel stuck, Dr. Reeve is able to easily determine a cohesive and holistic plan. Dr. Reeve regularly spends hours with trainees after clinic dissecting cases, and takes time away from her clinic to lecture on psychopharmacology. On top of all that, she writes academic papers with residents, improving our writing and understanding of research. We are so grateful to have you, Dr. Reeve! David J. Kolko, PhD Submitted by Kimberly S. Hsiung Dr. Kolko has been my research mentor for the last five years and is easily one of the top mentors I ever had. From the start, he invested in turning a storage room into an office space for me, and his door was always open. He has answered my emails on weekends, late nights, and early mornings\u2014often the same day. His unwavering belief in me has revived my self-confidence. Although Dr. Kolko has helped me gain success through publications and presentations, he more importantly showed me the effect of a generous, collaborative attitude\u2014a lesson I will never forget. HONOR YOUR MENTOR MARCH/APRIL 2020 85Edwin J. Cook, MD, and Bennett L. Leventhal, MD Submitted by Suma Jacob, MD, PhD I'd like to honor both Edwin J Cook, MD, and Bennett Leventhal, MD. I met each of them when I was an undergraduate, knowing that I wanted to study the brain and behavior but not certain about taking a clinical or research path. If it were not for them and my early research mentors, Wendy Heller, PhD, and Neil Pliskin, PhD, I would not be who I am today. Connect with trainees early to show them what child psychiatry offers! I took the long path of training. I strive to integrate and share these privileges of learning and mentorship every day. Kathleen Grissett, MD Submitted by Jeena Kar As a fourth-year medical student I felt overextended and overwhelmed until I met Dr. Kathleen Grissett. Dr. Grissett is invested in her students' education and well-being at the same time. It felt like a breath of fresh air when she asked me about my living situation and expressed concern about matters beyond my education. I saw the way she met her patients with empathy and concern \u2014 and felt inspired that I could one day have a practice like and also balance having a family. When she took me to breakfast at a local coffee shop before work, I felt hopeful that one day I could be a mentor this amazing to someone else and make someone burnt-out feel eager again. Dorothy Grice, MD and Maria del Pilar Trelles Thorne, MD Submitted by Vasiliki Eirini Karagiorga, MD My journey in child psychiatry has been shaped by the guidance and support of my outstanding teachers Dr. Dorothy Grice and Dr. Maria del Pilar Trelles Thorne. Their inspiration, encouragement, ethics, humility, generosity, their pleasure in mentorship, are extraordinary gifts which uncovered new depths of understanding and wisdom. Their most important lesson was the way they modeled how to be a more effective clinician by being genuine and caring. My mentors strengthened my trust in the power of our profession and its tremendous impact. I am grateful for everything I learnt from them and blessed to have met them in my path. I treasure everything they have taught me! HONOR YOUR MENTOR 86 AA CAP NEWSHans Steiner, MD Submitted by Niranjan S. Karnik, MD, PhD If not for Hans Steiner, I would never have become a child psychiatrist or an academic researcher. During my clinical rotations in medical school, a child psychiatrist asked me about my research interests and mentioned Hans Steiner as someone who was interested in these areas. I sent Hans an email, he invited me to Stanford for an elective, helped me get a Jeanne Spurlock Summer Fellowship, and then recruited me to Stanford for residency and fellowship. Throughout my time at Stanford he was (and still is) the best of mentors. Patient, funny, thoughtful. I now find myself in the role of mentor and try to take the same approach with my trainees. John T. Walkup, MD Submitted by Priti M. Kothari, MD The two-year anniversary of the deadly school shooting in my town of Parkland, Florida, is approaching, and being a local child and adolescent psychiatrist to the community in which I lost siblings of patients and teachers I knew has been demanding. I could not have done it without the help of many colleagues and mentors including Dr. John Walkup. Upon graduating from Johns Hopkins, he encouraged me to open a solo practice and gave me reassurance and support. This was huge. Fifteen years later I still rely on him to to be a thought leader in the field. It seems like yesterday I was sitting as an eager fellow, ferociously writing down all his words in a journal I keep to this day. Thank you for allowing me to nominate an excellent teacher, role model and most importantly humble doctor as him. Michael Bloch, MD, MS Submitted by Amalia Londono, Andrea Diaz Stransky, and all Solnit Integrated Adult and Child Psychiatry Fellows, Yale Child Study Center Michael Bloch has mentored numerous medical students, residents, and fellows in child psychiatry. He is the mentor each of us needs, and a fierce advocate for each of us. He takes time to get to know us and works hard to provide us with concrete guidance that will help us grow and pursue fulfilling career paths. Michael is the mentor who might suggest the crucial change that makes a grant fundable, a study feasible, or a dream attainable. The success of his trainees, at all levels, demonstrates his talent as a mentor, but the fondness that his trainees have for him speaks even more highly to his qualities as a mentor, a clinician and a human being. Thank you, Michael! HONOR YOUR MENTOR MARCH/APRIL 2020 87Anne Benham, MD Submitted by Andrea Mann, DO I'd like to honor Anne Benham, MD, at Stanford University. Dr. Benham introduced me to the world of infant and preschool psychiatry. She was instrumental in helping me develop expertise in evaluating and treating young children and their families. She has shared her wealth of clinical knowledge and love for play therapy with child psychiatry fellows at Stanford for years. Through her mentorship, she helped me gain confidence in my evaluation and psychotherapeutic skills. I love how she integrates Cognitive Behavioral Play Therapy with a psychodynamic perspective. It has been an honor to have learned from her over the past several years. Thank you! Roddy Strobel, MD Submitted by Zeeshan Mansuri MD, MPH One morning, as I was about to grab coffee from the coffee machine, Dr. Roddy Strobel, the senior attending psychiatrist, told me that my patient was ready. I quickly put my cup away and proceeded to see the patient. She came in two minutes later with a coffee for me. I was shocked. I didn't expect this from an attending. How many senior doctors would make coffee for a resident? How many would go and give the coffee to the resident in front of a patient? These random acts of kindness and humility are what make you feel valued and respected and that is what ultimately matters in the end. Barbara Rila, PhDS Submitted by Zeeshan Mansuri MD, MPH I asked Dr. Barbara Rila for help on a project about teaching children from 2nd to 7th grade about emotions. She came up with the brilliant idea of using the movie \"Inside Out\" as a guide for discussing emotions. We taught the kids about the different levels of emotions and techniques for managing their emotions. Dr. Rila taught me how to talk to children in a manner that they can understand and I want to thank her for all that she does for us and for the community. Shailesh Jain, MD Submitted by Zeeshan Mansuri, MD, MPH Residency is tough: it's a lot of learning, responsibility and growth packed into a short time frame. You can't do it all on your own. Dr. Shailesh Jain helped me navigate the intricacies of residency. He believed in me when I was not able to believe in myself and his guidance and support helped me overcome the fear and uncertainties of the intern year. Because of his mentorship and support, I was able to publish more than 40 papers including 15 manuscripts, won 7 awards including the \"Resident Recognition Award\" from the APA and match to an amazing Fellowship at Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Thank you very much! HONOR YOUR MENTOR 88 AA CAP NEWSRichard Ferry, MD Submitted by Dean Martin, MD It was my first year of Child Fellowship at the University of Utah. I was struggling with a case: an adolescent I felt \"wasn't working\" in treatment. I complained in supervision to my attending, Richard Ferry, quoting something I had heard in adult training: that one \"shouldn't be working harder than the patient.\" With an alarmed expression, Dr. Ferry looked at me and said \"You're SUPPOSED to work harder than your patient\u2014that's your job, that's what child psychiatrists do!\" I realized he was right and revised my attitude from that moment on. William Lexington Grapentine, MD Submitted by Thomas Miller, MD During my residency training at Brown University, I had the good fortune to have Dr. William Grapentine as my attending child psychiatrist at Bradley Hospital. Dr. Grapentine was very friendly and encouraging to me during this often stressful time. Even though the training program and hospital were very large, he managed to take the time to individually teach the intricacies of the diagnostic interview. He set a positive example of how to interact with staff and patients in an often lighthearted manner. His mentorship continues to influence me even today. David Dunn, MD Submitted by Genalynne Mooneyham, MD I was fortunate to complete my training in the Triple Board Residency at Indiana University School of Medicine. Our program director Dr. David Dunn was a legend of sorts... we affectionately referred to him as \"the child whisperer\". Dr. Dunn would come into a busy clinic room and bring with him an air of calm, a sense of direction, and the type of clinical acumen that you can only hope to achieve. When we would staff our patients, he would readily pull out a journal article that had been meticulously clipped and neatly filed. He made evidenced-based medicine come to life and I am grateful for his investment in my education. Jennifer Havens, MD Submitted by Warren Ng, MD Dr. Jennifer Havens is a force of nature and the ultimate advocate, trailblazer, leader, humanitarian and innovator for childrens' mental health. She gave me my first job in an amazing program created to serve HIV-infected children, women, and their families. Her passion, mission, determination, and creativity inspired me every day. She is a creator who imagines new programs to serve under-served populations including medically ill, traumatized, and justice-involved youth in the public sector. She is a fierce and outspoken advocate for kids. She's widely celebrated for her accomplishments and she's a hero of mine. HONOR YOUR MENTOR MARCH/APRIL 2020 89Ayame Takahashi, MD Submitted by Sohail Nibras, MD Dr. Ayame Takahashi has been an amazing mentor. I have learned so much from her and I can truly say that my confidence in my abilities has greatly increased under her leadership. Her ability to provide genuine feedback in an encouraging manner allowed me to feel as if I can discuss any concerns with her. She has also been a very good advocate for me. She goes out of her way to help trainees achieve their goals. Working with Dr. Takahashi has been an invaluable experience for both my career and personal growth, and I will always be grateful for her support and kindness. Beverly Bryant, MD Submitted by Avani Patel It sounds silly now, but I remember crying in the office of my child psychiatry attending about choosing a specialty. Dr. Beverly Bryant gave me some examples of why she felt I was a strong medical student and why I would make an incredible child psychiatrist. She shared that she would support me no matter what specialty I choose; however, she believed I would find my way to child psychiatry as my heart belongs there. Dr. Bryant stated, \"Avani, you just have 'it,' and that special something can't be taught.\" Needless to say, she continues to my inspiration and a great mentor! Cesar Soutullo, MD, PhD Submitted by Victor Pereira-Sanchez, MD Dr. Soutullo is a passionate Spanish child and adolescent psychiatrist trained in Cincinnati, Ohio. He started from scratch a pioneer child & adolescent psychiatry unit in Navarra, Spain, which has inspired a number of trainees and psychiatrists in our country of origin and abroad. I was one of the latest residents to be formed by him before both of us moved to the US last year. Since I met him for the first time when I was in Medical School, he was instrumental in my vocation and early career as a would-be child psychiatrist. Thank, you, Cesar! Anne Benham, MD Submitted by Magdalena Romanowicz, MD I would like to honor my mentor Dr. Anne Benham. She inspired me to pursue a career in infant and preschool psychiatry, a field that I had known so little about prior to meeting her. She spent many hours tirelessly teaching me how to assess and treat young children and after I left fellowship she continued to mentor me from a distance. Maybe most important, Dr. Benham is a real role model in how she is handling her life. She has a successful academic career, great marriage, three children and many grandchildren. I have always aspired to follow her path. HONOR YOUR MENTOR 90 AA CAP NEWSCheryl McCullumsmith, MD Submitted by Ashish Rungta, MD Dr. McCullumsmith has been instrumental in supporting and helping me through my career. Without her guidance and help, I would not have made it this far. She saw potential when others saw liability. As a department chair of Psychiatry too, she is revolutionizing the practice of Psychiatry at UT. Charles H. Zeanah, MD Submitted by Daniel Schechter, MD Charley Zeanah has been an incredible mentor, colleague, and friend since I was awarded an AACAP Presidential Scholar Award in 1997 and Pilot Research Award in 1999 that allowed me to learn the basics of infant and early childhood mental health evaluations and treatment with families with significant interpersonal violent trauma, abuse and neglect histories. Charley and his wife Paula welcomed me into the field and I rapidly began to think about how to follow his model of integrating clinical work and research. Thanks to the foundation set down with Charley and his team, I am celebrating 20 years of a program of research on the impact of maternal exposure to interpersonal violence across the lifespan on the mother-child relationship during early development and on child social-emotional outcomes. Thanks, Charley! Michael Rancurello, MD Submitted by Jeanette M. Scheid MD, PhD I first met Michael Rancurello as a 2nd year general resident on child/adolescent inpatient rotation. He welcomed a psychiatry \"newbie\" with an interest in child and adolescent psychiatry. That experience cemented my plans to continue into fellowship. I worked with Dr. Rancurello again during a child fellowship residential program rotation. By that time, I could truly appreciate the sophistication that Dr. Rancurello brought to child case formulation. Dr. Rancurello treated me as a junior colleague, assumed and expected competence, and taught formally and by example. He has remained a model for my work with patients, families, residents, fellows and colleagues. Pamela McPherson, MD Submitted by Hannah Scott Dr. Pamela McPherson: first a teacher and mentor, forever a friend. She has worn so many hats and wears them well. She inspires residents and fellows to continue learning and training throughout their lives. During my fellowship, she invited me and procured a ticket to a sold-out show to hear the Notorious RBG (Ruth Bader Ginsburg) give a talk on her life's work. It was the highlight of my fellowship and awe-inspiring to sit among two women professionals who I respect and aspire to be like. Thank you, for bringing to light what was within. HONOR YOUR MENTOR MARCH/APRIL 2020 91Prasad Raghuram, MD Submitted by Pooja Shah, MD Dr. Prasad exhibits great personal and professional attributes. His clinical acumen, professional interactions and academic prowess speaks volumes about his passion for helping children with neurodevelopmental challenges, love for psychopharmacology, and clinical teaching of psychiatry fellows like me. Dr. Prasad is genuinely invested in my academic progress. He has empowered me to identify my own strengths, beliefs and personal attributes. It takes a great mentor to recognize the strengths of the mentee and push them to be the best version of themselves, and he has put substantial efforts in sculpting my career and personal identity. Dr. Cecilia Devargas, MD Submitted by Aisha S. Shariq, MD I want to acknowledge Dr. Cecilia Devargas for being a great mentor. She is very knowledgeable, approachable, and is an excellent role model for trainees. Her clinical interactions are the foundation of her knowledge and set an example for her fellows on how to practice Child Psychiatry. Dr. Devargas takes great interest in fellows learning and is always very supportive of any educational activity the fellows want to be part of. Dr. Devargas is a kind and professional mentor who taught me how to help and be available for my colleagues. I am blessed to have Dr. Devargas as my program director. Oscar G. Bukstein, MD, MPH Submitted by Kevin M. Simon, MD Dr. Bukstein has been a great mentor during my child & adolescent psychiatry fellowship at Boston Children's Hospital. He has not only been supportive and available for clinical supervision and advice, but has played the role of a sponsor for opportunities initially unbeknownst to me. He additionally, has been encouraging of my pursuit of additional clinical training in addiction medicine, participation within AACAP committees, and probably most important has allowed me the room to grow and be comfortable in prioritizing family. I feel fortunate to have him as a part of my becoming a child & adolescent psychiatrist. Thank you Dr. Bukstein. Bennett L. Leventhal, MD Submitted by Russell H. Tobe, MD Twenty years ago, my naivety to Bennett Leventhal's great contributions facilitated my disinhibited approach of him as a first-year medical student. Bennett made time and taught me psychiatry. He helped me navigate training and career decisions while shepherding me through challenges. Though few are so knowledgeable and wise, Bennett's legacy is his generosity, steadfast moral compass, and loyalty. I fully trust not only his concrete guidance but his unwavering commitment to my personal happiness and growth. Though Bennett's teaching has made me a competent and caring physician, his modeling has shaped my growth as an individual far beyond clinical practice and academics. About this, I am not na\u00efve. HONOR YOUR MENTOR 92 AA CAP NEWSLuz Minerva Guevara, MD Submitted by Minerva Villafane-Garc\u00eda, MD Doctor Luz Minerva Guevara was in charge of the Child and Adolescent Fellowship Program where I trained in the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Puerto Rico. She took time to know every fellow and encouraged us to continue to grow professionally even beyond training. Dr. Guevara guided us to join AACAP as active participants. Under her mentorship, I attended AACAP Meetings since early in my career and, even in semi-retirement, continue participating in Committee work. Her commitment to service and academic pursuits has greatly influenced my own career as well as that of many others. Anna Kerlek, MD Submitted by Colleen Waickman Dr. Anna Kerlek is my mentor in child and adolescent psychiatry. As a third-year medical student, I emailed Dr. Kerlek to ask for advice about CAP due to my interest in psychiatry and pediatrics. Dr. Kerlek emailed me back within five minutes and had me on the phone within the hour, ready to offer advice. She set up a CAP elective at Nationwide Children's Hospital for me and was an excellent resource throughout the residency application process. She also helped me apply for the AACAP Life Mentors Scholarship, allowing me to attend AACAP's Annual Meeting for the first time this year. Deborah Weidner, MD Submitted by Paul Weigle, MD I'm pleased for the opportunity to honor my mentor, Deborah Weidner, MD. I've been fortunate to work with Dr. Weidner during my child fellowship, and again as an attending for nearly ten years, during which she was the ideal supervisor. She taught me how to lead via her own example, which is authentic, compassionate, attentive, decisive and accountable. She instilled a vital sense of purpose, teamwork and community among her medical staff. She encouraged me to take on administrative duties, including my current role as associate medical director. For her mentorship I am grateful. Alexandra Harrison, MD Submitted by Muhammad Zeshan, MD I want to honor my mentor Dr. Alexandra Harrison who is child psychiatry faculty at Harvard. Dr. Harrison nudged me forward through the darkness and peeled away the superficial and suffocating layers of incompetency that might have kept me from achieving my full potential during my first few months of CAP fellowship at Boston Children's. She believed in me when I was not able to believe in myself and helped me overcome a helpless feeling of isolation. Because of her mentorship and supervision, Dr. Harrison and I were able to start the first infant training workshops in Pakistan.

First, 70-80 percent of children with mental health (MH) needs will never see a CAP, and, unless seen at school, most children with MH needs will not be seen for more than a few visits (Gopalan et al. 2010). Second, children spend 15,000 hours with teachers from kindergarten through high school, and as such, they have signifi-cant potential to promote MH. Teachers modeling effective MH practices in their lives and in the classroom can be powerful protective factors for child MH. Unfortunately, educators, who communities rely on to teach social-emotional learning and well-being (WB), are sometimes poorly equipped with these skills. Furthermore, approximately 40-50 percent of teachers leave teaching within five years, which often impacts our patients (Barnes et al. 2007). So TWB programs that can better prepare teachers with coping skills to face the challenges of working in a school and promote good MH practices for stu-dents can reduce teacher stress/burnout, turnover, and improve teacher quality of life and positive student outcomes (Greenberg et al. 2016). We implemented a TWB program in Washington, DC, for new teach-ers. We used the POISE Well-Being Self-Assessment Scale to help teachers discern their relative WB strength and weakness areas. 1 Please see the POISE Well-Being Self-Assessment Scale chart on the following page.\"POISE\" refers to 5 domains of WB (Physical, O ccupational, Intellectual, Social, and Emotional) addressed in our TWB workbook (available free at medstarwise.org/resources). Low scores in any of the five-item WB areas suggest targets for support. The workbook chapters can be done in any order, based on unique needs for sleep hygiene, time manage-ment, etc. Our TWB program with 40 first-year urban teachers indicated: 60-68% reported WB was important in their training 80% reported their emotional stateaffected their classroom behavior 62% listened to music more often toimprove WB, while less than 40%made significant changes to theirsleep, nutrition, or exercise practices 51% took WB practices theyhad learned and applied them intheir classroom. Of the subgroup reporting interest in WB, 78% made significant changesin their daily routine, and 89%applied WB practices in their ownclassrooms (Bostic et al. 2019). Most teachers recognized that their emo - tional state had a significant impact on their classroom. Indeed, the Emotional domain, particularly mindfulness, rec-ognizing their emotional triggers, and using \"HARPS\" ( Healthy A lternatives, Reframing stressful circumstances, Problem-solving, and relying on one's Social supports for \"reality-checking\" and different ideas) helped them manage stress in the classroom. In the Physical domain, teacher use of music playlists while commuting to work and during the day were reported to be particularly useful, as was walking while meeting with others. Teachers favored time-management tactics in the Occupational domain;, effective questioning and active constructive response tactics in the Social domain;, and in the Intellectual domain, they focused on how they \"actually spend the minutes of their lives,\" and how this fits with their values. WB efforts extend beyond teachers. Physician burnout worsened between 2011-14 (Shanafelt et al. 2015), with 60 percent of job satisfaction related to coping techniques, lifestyle, and internal attitudes and beliefs (Bohnert, 2006). Strategies for TWB may be applicable for us, and efforts are indeed underway to develop such curricula. Please feel encouraged to employ any of these TWB practices and share any experiences with us at Jeffrey.q.bostic@gunet.george - town.edu . m Jeff Q.

MARCH/APRIL 2020 97 FEATURESUtilizing Our Knowledge of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) to Improve Clinical Outcomes \"It is essential that clinicians become educated about, and recognize ACEs and learn strategies for prevention and care of patients who have experienced ACEs.\" p.25 (Jones, Merrick & Houry, 2020). 3 This statement caught my attention, particularly as the two co-authors are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While in full agree-ment with the statement, I will take it one-step further: we must pay attention to the ACEs of the parents/caregivers of our patients. Because of the research done since the landmark 1998 publication of the work of Filetti, Anda, Nordenberg et al., 2 and our own clinical observations and findings, we are aware of the multi-generational transmission of trauma and family dysfunction, leading not only to chronic physical diseases, but also to emotional, behavioral and cognitive disorders resulting from early assaults on brain development. After becoming an adoptive mother, Cissy White, who ran a group called \"Parenting with ACEs\" in Philadelphia, wrote poignantly about her epiphany that her childhood trauma would interfere with her capability for healthy mothering. To quote from her blog, \"Learning about trauma and recov-ery was important, to be sure. It helped me understand why I struggled with anxiety, nightmares and social issues...but it didn't teach me how to gain what I lacked as an adult or had missed as a child.\" Learning about ACEs helped her to understand attachment and its role in providing stability and security for her daughter, and what type of environment Marilyn B. Benoit, MD, SHSA, LFAACAPshe wanted her child exposed to. Her words were, \"This is empowering and motivating!\" The term \"toxic stress\" has gained a lot of traction in our behavioral health lexi-con as we attempt to explain the impact of a chronic elevation in cortisol levels 1 in children affected by the accumulation of ACEs. ACEs are highly correlated with negative health outcomes across the life-span: both physically and mentally, including early death. They affect the immune system, endocrine system, the cardiovascular system, gastro-intestinal system, and brain development, thereby affecting emotional and behavioral regulation, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal and socialization skills. Substance use disorders, suicide and cancer are also elevated in populations with higher ACEs. The ACEs initially identified by Filetti, Anda et al. 2 included all types of child maltreatment, domestic violence, separa - tion and divorce, and parental mental illness, incarceration and substance abuse. The concept of adverse child-hood experiences is no longer confined to this 10-item checklist. Roy Wade, a pediatrician at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is pursuing research on what he terms, \"Urban ACEs,\" includ-ing experiences of racism, being bullied, poverty, and community violence. In the United States, experiences of school shootings, and the active shooter pre-paredness must be considered, and for children in war-torn countries, the expe-riences of war conflict, displacement, and the disappearance or death of loved ones must also be included. Intervention During my tenure as the Chief Medical/ Clinical Officer of a national behavioral healthcare organization, it became clear that the histories of our patients with severe emotional and behavioral disorders revealed significant child-hood trauma, with most patients having more than four and, in some cases, eight ACEs. A high percentage of the youth we served came from the fos-ter care system and had experienced instability through multiple placements, inpatient hospitalizations, and several residential placements, compound-ing the trauma in their lives. It became clear to me that we were missing some critical information, as the right ques-tions had not been asked and explored. Consequently, we initiated the use of the ACEs questionnaire at intake, improving our identification of trauma generating experiences. The questionnaire had to be administered by a clinician, not be completed prior to the patient/family being seen, with sensitivity and vigilant observation to discern whether the ques-tions might be traumatically triggering to the patient, and follow-up with appropri-ate clinical intervention. Having run my own center previously, I had become aware of the needs of the parents/caregivers of our patients. We learned of their own sexual abuse, loss and grief, neglect, abandonment, exposure to violence and substance abuse...their own untreated psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet, we were expecting them to participate in parenting classes, do homework and function as healthy parents. One parent was courageous enough to tell me that she resented the fact that we were so nurturing and caring for her two chil-dren, but that we failed to do the same for parents! That was an eye-opener. Subsequently, we became more attentive to the mental health and cognitive needs of other caregivers. I recall an outpatient experience I had with a young mother whose son was referred to Children's Hospital center by his day care center. The toddler was isolating himself, not eating, and chewed his blanket incessantly. This child was suffering from an anaclitic depression: mother was not emotionally available to provide the nurturing and protection he needed. It turned out that this single mother was cohabiting with a drug abus-ing, physically and emotionally abusive partner. Her own childhood history 98 AA CAP NEWS FEATURESwas traumatic, with several ACEs. She was diagnosed with a major depression which I treated with trauma-focused psychotherapy, psychoeducation and antidepressants. No direct intervention was done with her son. Mother engaged with treatment, completed high school, got a stable job, and left the destructive relationship. Her son thrived. This case illustrates that we, child and adoles - cent psychiatrists, have the expertise to treat adult parents/caregivers. I think we have been misguided in our think-ing that we should not treat the parents of our patients who are in desperate need of active treatment, not just \"par-ent training.\" It is possible to maintain the boundaries necessary in providing such treatment. Bellis et al (2019) 1 performed a meta- analysis of poor health outcomes associated with ACEs in Europe and in North America. Economic costs in North America associated with ACEs (two or more) were estimated at $748 billion, and in Europe at $581 billion. These numbers are astounding. Mental illness outcomes were higher than physical illness, with 30% anxiety disorders, and 40% depressive disorders. The authors concluded, \"our findings reinforce previous results that identify childhood as a crucial time in establishing the foundations of good mental health.\" 1 Adding, \"For those experiencing ACEs, interventions to improve parenting skills, to strengthen parent-child attachment, and to develop children's resilience can help to moderate the harmful effects of ACEs.\" 1 What does this all mean for us as child & adolescent psychiatrists? We should focus our efforts at minimizing and pre-venting the occurrence of ACEs. How? We must focus more on parental and family functioning. Prevention Bellis et al. (2019) recommended, \"Rebalancing expenditure towards ensur - ing safe and nurturing childhoods would be economically beneficial and relieve pressures on the healthcare systems.\" 1 How can we address ensuring safe child-hoods? We should begin by supporting parents/caregivers. Efforts to provide some extended parental leave for new parents is a step in the right direction. Additionally, providing pre-natal par - ent education about ACEs, assessing parental ACEs, and addressing trauma in the lives of future parents could be an important preventative measure. After birth, ongoing parental support in the form of medical, emotional, food, housing, and teaching healthy parent-child interactions will also be helpful. The landmark Olds 6 Elmira County home visitation study and follow-up show very positive outcomes in the children of those parents 15 years later. Efforts to prevent child maltreatment and other ACEs cannot be forged without a major focus on the communities in which our children live. Government and private business partnerships are necessary. Communities' infrastruc-ture must support affordable housing, good neighborhood schools, recreation facilities, faith communities, family engagement, and safety with positive law enforcement engagement. Child and adolescent psychiatry must advance its efforts to engage with obstetricians, pediatricians, primary care physicians, other behavioral healthcare providers and educators to build profes-sional networks that will be vigilant about early detection of risks for adverse childhood experiences. Co-located care may offer a unique opportunity for inter-vention; Marie-Mitchell and Kostolansky (2019) advocate that \"integrated behavioral health service models would optimally include adult mental health and substance use treatment programs, as well as mental health promotion programs for pediatric patients.\" Most places do not have sufficient providers to meet the needs of the population, especially in rural communities, many of which register very high ACEs and multi-generational drug dependency. We need to expand training in trauma-informed care and engage with our school com-munities to educate school personnel to identify children at risk, provide referrals, and to establish environments that mitigate, rather than exacerbate children's ACEs.

I have journeyed with the people of Central America since volunteering to train health promoters in a conflict zone during El Salvador's twelve-year, U.S.-funded civil war. pon entering the ORR facility, my initial reaction was relief. I was met with the sound of Central American music, the colors of Central American flags, and decorations for upcoming Halloween festivities. I decorated my office with photos and crafts from El Salvador and informed my patients of my history with their homeland. One youth reminisced-\"I used to work on a farm with fruit trees just like those. I hate being locked up here!\" Some opted for voluntary return home. A teen girl shared-\"My cousin painted her life in Florida through rose-colored glasses. I couldn't go to school in Guatemala because I'd have to cross three rivers. I came to join her but I'm locked up instead so I asked to go home.\" Others feared that return-ing home would mean certain death. A teen had been threatened when he tried to protect his mother from her Sinaloa drug-cartel-leader-boyfriend's blows. Another faced threats for failing to join the Mara Salavatrucha gang. Youth pushed to the US by threat of imminent harm or lack of access to edu-cation were pulled by the promise of liberty and justice for all. A Honduran youth who'd been working since age Carol L. Kessler, MD, MDiv seven begged his father to allow his jour-ney north to the land where it's illegal for children not to attend school. He lost his father's phone number as he crossed the river. Scenes from the ride on the US-bound train through Mexico, \"la Bestia\", haunt him\u2014a child struck by a branch falling to his death; an intoxicated man on the tracks getting run over. Many youth wear a cross or speak of God guiding them. One youth thanks God for leading him from a town filled with drugs and gangs to a country where he might get an education, work, and send money to his family. Prayers to God ask for sustenance of loved ones left behind and for companionship through the night. It doesn't take long to see the toll that detention takes on these youths' psyches\u2014as they are held indefinitely in a web of legal and administrative pro-cesses with little control over daily life. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child declares that \"immi-gration detention is never in a child's best interest and therefore always a child rights violation.\" 1 Detention is deemed permissible as a measure of last resort,\" for the \"minimum necessary period,\" and \"limited to strictly exceptional cases.\" 2,3 A Workgroup for the Best Interests of Unaccompanied/ Separated Children recommends that each child be assigned a trained advocate to ensure that the best interest of the child is at the center of decisions made at the time of appre-hension, while in custody, and upon release. 4 Failure to appoint such an advo - cate makes the ORR the youths' de facto guardian. This leaves the door open for mental health professionals to intervene in a manner that may be legal, but may not be in accordance with professional, ethical standards of care. As a child psychiatrist, I uphold the biopsychosocial nature of our field. In underfunded clinics, foster children are frequently brought for a psychiatric eval-uation by a foster parent or caseworker who is not privy to the child's history. I am often told that the child is aggressive with the expectation that I will diagnose and prescribe. I clarify that I can merely perform an examination of the child's current mental status. To do a psychi-atric evaluation, I need copies of foster agency records\u2014history of placement/pregnancy/ birth/ development/abuse/education/family/medical and psychiatric treatment. Were rights not terminated, communication with biological parents is a critical component of the evaluation and treatment planning process. Indeed, US citizen parents have the right to con-sent or refuse to psychiatric medication prescribed to their children, with a fam-ily court judge overriding refusal if it is against the child's best interest. And so, 100 AA CAP NEWS OPINIONSI was pleased to learn that at least one of my colleagues at the ORR facility rou-tinely spoke to unaccompanied minors' relatives before prescribing medication. This proved to be the exception. A Guatemalan teen presented for a psychiatric visit after learning from her immigration lawyer that she would be transferred to an adult ICE detention center should another disposition fail to materialize before her upcoming eighteenth birthday. She worried that her irritability and resultant rude behavior would result in incident reports that might interfere with her release to the community. She was frustrated with her case manager's failure to notify her about a tentative upcoming visit with her uncle/potential sponsor. The following week, I was shocked when Maria requested to call her father so that she could ask to return to Guatemala. For her, ORR records con - firmed her narrative of fleeing home to escape sexual abuse by a neighbor with no possibility of police intervention. I told her that I would use this opportunity to speak with her father to ensure that he was aware of the three psychotropic medications she'd been taking since her detention months ago and to obtain the elements vital for a psychiatric evalu-ation. He was shocked to hear of her desire to return home, where he had been unable to keep her safe from her older brothers, who abused her while intoxicated. He'd arranged for Maria to flee to her uncle's home in the U.S. Before ending the call, I learned that Maria's father hadn't spoken to any pre-vious psychiatrist and wasn't aware that she was taking medication. Maria grew angry as she realized that her father was communicating that it wasn't safe for her to return home. I called the program director to inform her of the contradiction between the father's history and the federal records; of the father's lack of awareness that his daughter was taking psychotropic medi-cation; and of Maria's need for support. I was told that staff should not be told any personal information and would escort her to her cottage. I was advised ORR is Maria's guardian and that parental consent for psychotropic medication is not legally necessary. Her statement clarified that \"alien\" youths' parents' rights cease at the moment of detention by U.S. Border Patrol. Though my role was to enforce ORR policy, adherence to such policy would violate my professional ethic. My concerns are echoed in an article describing clinicians in facilities that detain child asylum seekers who \"ini-tially hoped that they were equipped to treat and support traumatized children...but felt increasingly hopeless in the face of a merciless government policy and the petty tyrannies of a detention envi-ronment run along the lines of a penal colony.\" The authors note that a pattern \"of clinical recommendations being ignored and dismissed as biased or inac-curate in a culture that saw the detainees as simulating distress and engaging in so called 'manipulative behaviors.\" 5 Indeed, thirteen-year-old David, a teen who was slow to engage, had a number of \"significant incident reports\". A few days earlier he had reportedly broken a pencil with intent to self-harm. He voiced frustration that he had been detained for months and believed that his case manager wasn't pursuing a potential sponsor. The case manager claimed that David was impatient and untrustworthy. She explained that she needed to make a family tree and then reach out to potential sponsors who would need to provide David's birth certificate. As David's psychiatrist, to ease his distress, I explained the process as the case manager had explained it to me. Together, we created a family tree. David then shared that he was an orphan who'd lived with his grand-mother in Guatemala City. There, gang members ordered him to steal a backpack. He was jailed for months, and when released feared gang reprisals. He fled to his aunt's home in Mexico. Later, he and his cousin sought a safer, brighter, future in the U.S. They parted ways en-route. His cousin was detained and eventually released to a family friend in Pennsylvania, where David hoped to join him. And so, I called his aunt in Mexico who shared his cousin's contact information. Within an hour, David was speaking with his cousin. A seed of hope for release to the commu-nity was planted. I requested that the program director schedule a time for me to meet with youths' case managers and therapists. She agreed, though she was surprised since my predecessor had assumed the role of independent \"prescriber\". I was shocked to be the only one to have concerns about the discrepancy between Maria's father's story and that of her federal record. The therapist was primarily concerned that Maria's urges to self-harm were a means of getting to her office to request more than the minimal required biweekly calls to her father. The meeting proceeded with brief reports about each \"minor.\" My inquiry into the status of David's potential spon-sor was deemed out of the scope of my role as a psychiatrist. My concerns about a youth who alleged sexual abuse by a staff member at another ORR facility was deemed a legal matter. Concerns that a youth referred due to symptoms of ADHD was illiterate led me to learn that individualized educational plans are only available in the community. Concerned that many had been waiting for foster homes for more than a year, I was told, \"welcome to Dante's inferno.\" At that moment, I believed that to stay at the center would violate my oath to \"do no harm.\" I joined my colleagues' conclusion \"that clinicians have an ethical responsibility to challenge the government when harm is done to indi-viduals and groups as a result of bad law and policy. Remaining silent and acting as a bystander in effect colludes with the harmful practices.\" 5 I concur with the American Pediatric Association's recommendation that exposure to deten-tion be eliminated and that the health consequences of detention of immigrant children in the U.S. be longitudinally evaluated. 6 I am encouraged by the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights' mis-sion to create a dedicated children's immigrant justice system. They heed the Inter-American Court of Human Rights' A Psychiatrist's Call MARCH/APRIL 2020 101 OPINIONScall to provide each child with \"a guard- ian ad litem to help him/her adjust to the U.S... and to make decisions in line with the child's best interests\". 7 They train volunteer child advocates to provide a voice to unaccompanied children similar to that granted to children in the domes-tic child welfare system who have been abused, neglected or abandoned. I leave the youth in the hands of the God they depend on, as they wait for a federal specialist to determine their fate\u2014voluntary departure; move to a sponsor or foster care; or graduation to adult ICE detention. I join Doctors for Camp Closure, a non-partisan orga-nization of healthcare professionals who oppose the inhumane detention of migrants and refugees attempting to enter the U.S. I end with the words of Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel - \"No Human Being is Illegal.\" m References 1.

All of these kids understand the fear for their family's safety and anxiety about losing everything\u2014their homes, treasured possessions and communities. Imagine a child in Sonoma County who had to be evacuated from approaching wildfires in 2017. It's safe to say that children have been re-traumatized by the Camp Fire in 2018, or the Kincade Fire of 2019, and undoubtedly will feel the intense anticipatory anxiety as fire season approaches again each September. It will be no different outside Sydney or Melbourne. Imagine a child in the Bahamas who recently lived through hurricane Dorian; the most destructive weather system ever to reach the Caribbean. These children suffer many of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) including hyper-arousal, sleep disruption, and avoidance behaviors; they may experience nightmares about trying to flee an approaching firestorm or torrential rains. These scenarios are a source not only of recurrent anxiety but a cyclical and seasonal reality. Even media depictions of major storms or floods heighten our experience of stress and threaten our sense of well-being. Research on stress and trauma demonstrates that fear and arousal levels in children are reduced when caring adults are able to listen to children's verbalized anxiety. A study I conducted at California Pacific Medical Center in Robert Root, MDOctober 2018 interviewing adolescents ages 12-18 showed that 88 percent of these kids reported significant concerns about climate change. The greatest fear expressed was about the impact of sea level rise, which pose an incalculable risk to the populations of New York, London, Mumbai and Shanghai. One teenage girl told me, \"It keeps me up at night. I feel utterly helpless!\" What is it like to grow up with such uncertainty about the safety of our environment? Children endured dire circumstances in Cape Town, South Africa and Chennai, India, when these cities faced acute drinking-water shortages. It is unprecedented in human history that this foundational security about the planet around us is shaken\u2014will the Earth continue to be able to nourish us and provide us with clean air and water and plentiful food? Millions of people in diverse regions of the world have now personally experienced the consequences of climate change. Eco-anxiety has engendered questions about whether children will even have a future and has led some to consider that it could be morally indefensible to bring new children into the world. Young people have sued the federal government for violating their rights to grow up in a world that is \"capable of sustaining human life.\" Many of us, adults as well as children, are experiencing \"climate grief.\" We are mourning the Earth as if we are grieving for the gradual decline of a dying loved one. Grief is a normal response to loss. Young children in Australia right now are mourning the loss of animals (millions of kangaroos and koalas perished in the recent wildfires), of their homes, or of a loved one. Older adolescents wrestle with the existential sense of species extinction and the loss of the sustainability of human life. More generally, we feel an evolving sense of the loss of safety, loss of control, and loss of the continuity of our family and \"being\" into the future. We may feel helpless and numb in the face of the magnitude of these stressors. Young children have a limited capacity to cope with overwhelming or scary information. Those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods in close proximity to polluting power plants or factories\u2014who are disproportionately children of color\u2014are even more vulnerable to the health and psychosocial risks of climate change. Children deserve both to have their physical health protected, and to have their sense of safety and security in the world restored. Children need to know that environmental scientists, policymakers, and other concerned citizens of the world are tirelessly tackling these issues. Parents need to be sensitive and responsive to children who voice their fears and anxiety about the future. Let's encourage climate change education and discussion in the classroom and around the dinner table. Taking positive action is profoundly helpful in lowering stress. Let us choose to engage and to confront our fears. Renewable energy and reforestation programs offer tangible and achievable steps to combat the climate crisis. The people of Ethiopia remarkably planted 220 million trees in less than 24 hours! High school students inspire others to feel social connectedness in the commitment to confront climate change, as with the Youth Climate Strike. There are steps that families can choose to do together which will give a child some locus of control such as changing to a plant-based diet or changing the home electricity bill to 100% clean energy. Engaging in constructive age-appropriate actions can effectively combat feelings of hopelessness. Young people in this generation are already confronting unique and intense \"We need a call to action to promote psychological well-being as we look at climate change challenges through the lens of children's mental health.\" MARCH/APRIL 2020 103 OPINIONSsources of stress in their lives including gun violence in their schools, distrust of political decision-makers, and misinformation in the media. Climate change issues further compound these persistent stresses. Social media and online information searches allow teens to be both better informed and, at times, bombarded with anxiety-generating data and images. This is where parents and teachers need to be highly attuned to children's expressions of distress in the home, at school and in the community. We must be galvanized not to tolerate these threats to our children's health. We need a call to action to promote psychological well-being as we look at climate change challenges through the lens of children's mental health. Let's re-establish our shared humanity\u2014across cultures, continents and the generations, as citizens of the planet.

MARCH/APRIL 2020 105MEETINGS AACAP Member Review: Clinical Essentials, AACAP's Series of Online CME Courses It can be challenging for a busy physi- cian to find time to complete yearly CME requirements, and it can be even harder to find activities that include clinical pearls of wisdom for child psy-chiatrists that can be quickly incorpo-rated into a diverse range of practice settings. For the past two years, I've been work- ing with a team of child and adolescent psychiatrist education experts, tasked with finding a solution to this issue. Together, we've come up with a series of online CME courses, called Clinical Essentials. Owen Muir, MDMy excitement for these courses began when I started reviewing material for our first course, Clinical Essentials on Substance Use Disorder. Prior to this course, I thought I knew how to approach marijuana, until I saw seg-ment on the exam findings for high THC 'wax' and 'shatter.' Now, I can catch the really at-risk kids. Not only did this essential information immediately benefit my practice, I am also more confident in accepting patients with substance use issues. We've now expanded our course cata- logue to include Clinical Essentials on Autism Spectrum Disorder, Depression, Positive Parenting Practices, and Sleep. All the courses include high-quality, carefully vetted lectures from top-rated AACAP speakers, and supporting materi-als to enhance learning, such as relevant journal articles, useful links, and self-assessment questions.I've encouraged my staff to review the content of these courses and each have commented on the practical nature of the content and the ease of implementa-tion. My hope for this review is get these courses into the hands of more physi-cians and medical professionals, so they may continue to expand their skillset and enhance patient outcomes.

AACAP has you Covered with WWW.AACAP.ORG/PILOTPROJECT Recertification efforts in psy- chiatry in the United States have continued to evolve since the publication of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports in 2000 and 2001. These reports highlighted the marked increase in the number of medical errors across the nation along with the need to make health care more equitable and efficient while improving safety and effectiveness in a more patient-centered manner. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), including the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN), developed a four-part maintenance of certification (MOC) process with the goal of ensuring continuous learn-ing over the course of a professional's career. There are four parts of MOC: Part I requires an unrestricted license to practice medicine; Part II requires self-assessment and continuing medical education credits; Part III is a cognitive exam given every ten years with the goal of assessing practice relevant knowledge and its clinical application; and Part IV includes peer review and performance in practice activities. Diplomates are eli-gible to take the Part III cognitive exam after completing Parts I, II and IV of the MOC process. The process has moved from a 10-year program to what ABPN calls continuing certification. The cogni-tive test is only one part of continuing certification, making it possible for the diplomate to be certified for an addi-tional 10 years, but only with ongoing completion of other MOC requirements along the way.The ABPN MOC Part III Pilot Project is a professional journal article-based assessment activity designed as an alternative to the existing secure, proc-tored 10-year MOC examination. This initiative involves greater engagement in active learning with clinically relevant and up-to-date medical knowledge. The Pilot Project utilizes important articles from professional journals that have been chosen by an ABPN committee (all of whom are AACAP members). The ABPN has chosen 50 articles from which participants must choose at least 30. Participants must answer correctly at least four out of five multiple-choice questions in conjunction with each arti-cle that they choose in order to receive credit for the article. They must pass the mini-exams on at least 30 total articles. If a participant fails to answer correctly four of the five questions for a specific article, the participant can choose an additional article from the 50 provided. No matter how many journal articles are available in the library of articles, diplo-mates must pass 30 article mini-exams out of a maximum of 40 article mini-exams. The mini-exams are open book and the diplomate may use the article to answer the questions. The ABPN notes that the questions will be written so that they cannot be easily answered by just reading the abstract thus encourag-ing greater retention of knowledge. In addition to completing Part III of MOC, participants will also be awarded 16 hours of non-CME self-assessment credit for Part II of MOC. The ABPN provides a sample article and questions for Pilot Project participants to reference. There are three categories of cost for Pilot Project journal articles ( No Cost: You will be able to access and read the article without paying a fee. Free to AACAP Members: These articles are not open access, but are free if you are a member of AACAP. Purchase May Be Required: In order to access online, you will need to buy the article or have a subscription to the journal). The 50 arti-cles chosen for the CAP pilot are listed on the AACAP website: www.aacap.org/pilotproject. At present, 35 of these articles are free to AACAP members, 12 are no cost, and three are available for a small fee. The ABPN staff has reported that par- ticipating CAP diplomates are satisfied with their experience and have said, \"the articles were educational and covered a wide range of pertinent topics,\" \"the articles were interesting and relevant to clinical work,\" and \"the questions were fair and helped develop critical thinking skills for incorporating interventions into everyday practice.\" Enrollment is still available depend- ing on your certificate expiration date. Diplomates who anticipate recertifica-tion during the years 2019-2024 whose ABPN MOC requirements are up-to-date Jeffrey Hunt, MD, and Sandra Sexson, MD \"The ABPN MOC Part III Pilot Project is a professional journal article-based assessment activity designed as an alternative to the existing secure, proctored 10-year MOC examination.

The Pilot Project will run for a total of 3 years, from 2019-2021 and, if approved by the ABMS, the ABPN plans to offer the option for all diplomates to transi-tion into this program in 2022. If you received a Pilot Project invitation and still want to enroll, please see the 'Part III Pilot' section of your ABPN Physician Folios account. Thus far, a large number of ABPN diplomates have enrolled in the CAP Pilot Project and a substantial num-ber have already started and finished the pilot. If the Pilot becomes a permanent option in 2022, diplomates participat-ing in the program will be expected to read a set number of articles every three years on an ongoing basis. Please access the ABPN website for more information: www.abpn.com/maintain-certification/moc-part-iii-pilot-project.Other AACAP MOC Products The AACAP Lifelong Learning Committee produces a module of seminal articles annually, some of which have already been chosen by the ABPN for the Part III Pilot Project. Completing these modules annually provide all the CME credits needed, both regular CME and SA CME, for meeting Part II of the present MOC requirements. In addition, the Lifelong Learning Committee sponsors an Institute at AACAP's Annual Meeting that brings in leaders in the field to discuss the compendium of articles chosen for the Module, providing an additional learn - ing pathway for practitioners to stay abreast of the literature in the field. Also in conjunction with the Annual Meeting, the Lifelong Learning Committee, along with the CME Committee, assemble the Annual Meeting Self-Assessment Exam and Annual Meeting Self-Assessment Workshop, each approved to offer 8 SACME credits. The goal of each activity is to assess a learner's current level of knowledge regarding child and adoles - cent psychiatry topics. AACAP's website also has a section of tools, developed by the Lifelong Learning Committee, that diplomates may use to meet both the clinical and feedback modules of Part IV of the present MOC requirements (www.aacap.org/pip). AACAP members interested in continued learning as well as meeting ongoing lifelong learning ABPN requirements should explore these oppor - tunities at www.aacap.opg/moc . m AACAP's Newest Lifelong Learning Module AACAP is proud to announce the release of Lifelong Learning Module 16: Relevant Clinical Updates for Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists .

AACAP responds to this alleged practice with a comment letter addressed to the director and acting director of the ORR and ICE, respectively. As a psychiatric organization dedicated to the healthcare and well-being of minors everywhere, we view this breach of confidentiality as contrary to accepted medical ethics and effective patient care. AACAP implores the ORR and ICE to end this practice of breaching the confidentiality of patient detainees seeking mental health treatment. The letter appears on the following pages.For questions or comments, or to speak to an expert, please contact the communications department at communications@aacap. org, or by phone at 202-966-3594. -#- The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry promotes the healthy development of children, adolescents, and f amilies through advocacy, education, and research.

Hayes Director Office of Refugee Resettlement Administration for Children & Families U.S. Department of Health & Hum an Services 330 C Street, SW Washington , DC 20201 Matthew T. Albence Acting Director U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement U.S. Department of Homeland Security 500 12 th Street, SW Washington , DC 20024 Dear Director Hayes and Acting Director Albence: On behalf of the 9 ,600 memb ers of the American Aca dem y of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), I write to c ondem n recently detailed actions by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and t he Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that have betrayed otherwise c onfid ential medical information. As you know, this past Sunda y's Washington Post front page featured the lead -in to a very disturbing story, \"Trust and Consequences,\" chronicling the plight of an adolescent who had shared personal information with an ORR-employed therapist relating to his trauma, only to have his confidential conversations shared with ICE officials who used them against him in deportation proceedings. From our understanding of the facts, also detailed today by National Public Radio, this adolescent did not pose an imminent danger to himself or others, but instead expressed anger, as is often felt later by victims of trauma. To use such statements against this detainee, or others similarly situated, is contrary to accepted medical ethics and effective patient care. It is simply not right to do so. As ORR considers way s to meet the medical and mental health needs of detainees, patient confidentiality must be the cornerstone of treatment, as an assurance first to the detainee and also to the mental health or other medical professionals with whom each will speak. To do less is to prosecute the very victims of violence and trauma seeking refuge in America, turning their sad stories against them. 3615 Wisconsin Avenue, NW | Washington, DC 20016-3007 | 202.966.7300 | www.aacap.org 118 AA CAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATION3615 Wisconsin Avenue, NW | Washington, DC 20016-3007 | 202.966.7300 | www.aacap.orgWe ask and implore your agencies to do better by the youth and families seeking asylum and safety in the United States.

Carlson, MD President MARCH/APRIL 2020 119 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONAACAP Policy Statement Clinical Use of Pharmacogenetic Tests in Prescribing Psychotropic Medications for Children and Adolescents Approved by Council March 2020 Background Several commercially available combinatorial pharmacogenomic tests are being marketed for psychiatric clinical practice. Commercial entities claim that the testing measures drug metabolism to guide medication choice and dosing to impact therapeutic response and side effects. In October 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety communication warning against the use of genetic tests with unapproved claims to predict medication response. The FDA stated that changing a patient's medication regimen based on the results of a pharmacogenomic test leads to \"inappropriate treatment decisions and potentially serious health consequences for the patient.\" Only a small fraction of the available commercial products have undergone randomized controlled trials in adults only. Current studies are limited by: P otential conflicts of interest S mall sample sizes S hort duration of follow-up L ack of blinding L ack of appropriate control groups Additionally, numerous factors affect medication response unaccounted for by genetic variation. Genetic variations are managed clinically with slow and thoughtful medication management. Furthermore, pharmacogenomic testing provides little meaningful information when two or more medications are used concurrently. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends: C linicians avoid using pharmacogenetic testing to select psychotropic medications in children and adolescents. F uture high-quality prospective studies to assess the clinical significance of pharmacodynamic and combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing in children and adolescents. Recommends accessible health clinic programs that provide a full range of services, including confidential counseling and information regarding sexual activity and reproductive health. -#- The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry promotes the healthy development of children, adolescents, and families through advocacy, education, and research. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are the leading physician authority on children's mental health.
