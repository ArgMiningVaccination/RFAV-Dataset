AWSNA Loans & Grants Financial assistance for Waldorf teacher education is available through AWSNA's Teacher Education Loans and Grants Program. AWSNA Loans and Grants are available for ECE Birth to 3yrs and Birth to 7yrs Waldorf Educator Training, and Grades Teacher Training. Grants: An applicant who has been accepted into either of the Institute's training programs, and is already teaching in a Waldorf classroom, can apply for the matching grant program. Whatever is requested, and can be allocated by AWSNA, must be matched by the school where the applicant is teaching. Where the combined total of AWSNA and school matching grants do not provide sufficient tuition to supplement the teacher's own resources, applicants may also apply for a teacher education loan. Loans: Any applicant who has been accepted into either of the Institute's training programs, can apply for an AWSNA loan. These loans are forgivable if you are hired as a three quarter to full time teacher in an AWSNA or WECAN member school for a total of at least three consecutive academic years within three years after graduation. For each consecutive year that you teach, the loan will be converted to a scholarship up to the entire loan balance. Applicants who begin teaching prior to graduation may have these years retroactively applied towards the three years of service, as long as one of the three years occurs in the year immediately following graduation. i.e. As long as you teach one complete year in an AWSNA-member school after you graduate from your teacher training, then the previous two years of teaching will also count. If you don't teach one year after graduation, then the two previous years will not count. You may ask for one year of loan deferral\u2014maternity leave or injury are possible reasons for this. After that one year, we resume as normal. If you're not back to teaching then you would make arrangements to repay. It is not possible to grant more than a year deferral. AWSNA Loans & Grants Application Deadline: Deadline extended to June 11th. AWSNA Loans & Grants Application Forms: Vidar Loan Vidar Loan Process for WCI Students The goal of this loan program is to ensure that there is support for Canadians who are in or wish to enter into the two training programs offered by the West Coast Institute. The Loan Process Vidar is the charity foundation that provides the funds for this loan program by loaning funds to the West Coast Institute. Interest-free loans for up to 80% of the yearly and total tuition are available. Students need to have a loan repayment plan organized with WCI at or before graduation. Bursary Potential for Canadian Students The Vidar Foundation is offering a bursary of up to 30% of the total loan amount for Canadian students who complete their training. They will forgive 6% of the student's loan as a bursary after the teacher has worked for a first school year at a Canadian Waldorf School. After each successive school year of working at a Canadian Waldorf School for the following 4 years, Vidar will forgive a further 6% of the student's loan as a bursary. WCI will notify the loanee of the adjusted loan amount to be repaid each year. Community Co-Signers Qualifying students would need to find a loan co-signer(s) to guarantee the repayment. The co-signer is guaranteeing payment of the loan if the student is unable to fulfill the loan repayment agreement. Loan Administration Fee The loan has a 5% fee of the loan amount, that goes to a growth contribution fund, with a maximum total of $600.00. The fee helps to build the fund for future students. The administration fee is a one time fee and is paid at the beginning of the first year of study. If the student negotiates a loan for the second and/or third year of their training, the 5% administration fee will apply to that amount as well, falling within the guideline of a maximum total of $600.00 for this fee. Loan Repayment The loan repayment schedule begins 6 months after graduation and can be up to a 5 year pay back term. The loan can be repaid in full at any time or in part-at a minimum of $100 a month-within the 5 year timeframe. If the student withdraws from the program before graduation, repayment begins within 6 months of the withdrawal date. Loan Interview Each applicant will meet with members of the WCI Loan Committee for a conversation to: - Review the loan process - Review the application form - Exploration of Need: What brought you to WCI? We know that you shared this in your application process. Has anything changed? Is there anything new you'd like to share? Where do you see this training taking you, what difference will it make in your life? Decision The student will be informed of the decision within a week of the interview. Vidar Loan Application Deadline: Deadline extended to June 11th. IDEA Scholarship WCI IDEA Scholarship ~ IDEA: inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility The goal of this scholarship is to ensure that there is support for applicants from underserved communities who wish to enter into one of the two training programs offered by the West Coast Institute. This scholarship program is offered with the support of donations to the West Coast Institute. At the West Coast Institute we understand that each human being is an entity of body, soul and spirit; we respect the integrity and individuality of everyone. We strive to provide education that is representative of the society we serve, acknowledging that this society includes all ages, a variety of gender identities, and diverse cultures and ethnicities. The greatest impact we can have on this effort is by making our educational training programs accessible and welcoming to a rich and diverse body of students. To this end we have established a scholarship fund for teacher training that is dedicated to aiding students from underserved groups and communities, with priority given to Black and Indigenous candidates. The systemic change that is being undertaken in the Waldorf movement includes welcoming and making nourishing and inclusive space for more teachers of color who will infuse the work of Waldorf education with their authentic lived experience and perspective. In this way, as we take up the task of examining our role and responsibility in perpetuating systems of racism, we work towards a more just and equitable future for Waldorf education and the communities it serves. IDEA Scholarship Application Deadline: Deadline extended to June 11th.
