The report said that it was theoretically possible that in some toddlers the vaccine, or other vaccines, could act as a trigger for autism but that this problem, if it existed, would be extremely rare. Otherwise, ''we would have seen some patterns of it in population-based studies,'' said Dr. Steven Goodman, an associate professor of oncology, pediatrics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Medicine and Public Health in Baltimore, who is one of the experts on the institute panel that produced the report. The institute is a nonprofit research organization that is contracted by government agencies to investigate medical issues and policies. Many parents of autistic children say their child had been developing normally until autism developed at around 15 to 18 months of age, when the MMR vaccine is normally administered. Every study that has looked at large numbers of vaccinated children has found ''absolutely nothing'' to show cause and effect between the vaccine and autism, Dr. Goodman said. But the rate of autism seems to be rising. In California, which tracks autism incidence more closely than many other states, 700 cases of the severest form of autism were formally diagnosed and reported to the California Department of Developmental Services in the first three months of 2001. In the same period last year, the department identified 416 new cases. It is not clear if similar increases are happening elsewhere, said Dr. Robert Byrd, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Davis who is carrying out a statewide study to find out whether the apparent increase is a result of misdiagnosis or a greater awareness of autism among physicians.. Ten years ago it was estimated that autism affected 1 in every 10,000 children, but recent trends suggest that 1 in 500 children have some form of the disorder. If the rate of autism is increasing and the MMR vaccine is not to blame, what else might be causing it? Scientists who study autism have found several genes that appear to be related to the disorder, a virus that causes brain damage similar to autism in animals and elevated levels of growth factors in the brains of newborns who later develop autism and mental retardation. They are studying how environmental pollutants, like mercury from municipal waste incinerators, affect developing brains. Autism is a developmental disorder with a wide spectrum of symptoms that range from mild to severe. In severe cases, autistic children exhibit ritualized body movements, repeated touching and sniffing of objects and an insistence on following precise routines. They have trouble making eye contact, speaking clearly and relating to other people. The fears about the vaccine have been supported by researchers in England who found live measles virus in the intestines of recently vaccinated autistic children. Since the brain and intestines communicate chemically, the researchers theorized that the triple vaccine set off both autism and intestinal "}
