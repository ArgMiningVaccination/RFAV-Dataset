Received: 05 April 2021 | Accepted: 15 May 2021 Keywords: homeopathy, banerjee protocol Aim: Homeopathy sees man as a whole; that is, along with the physical body, your spiritual structure also deals with your emotions and thoughts, helping the body heal itself and trying to achieve general recovery. Method: Homeopathy patients who applied to the Getat Center between 2018-2019 were scanned. Results: With the Banerji protocol, especially psychological positive results were obtained in homeopathic treatment. non-homeopathic drug use decreased. Homeopathy sees human beings as a whole; In other words, along with the physical body, your spiritual structure also takes care of your feelings and thoughts, helping the body to heal itself and trying to achieve general healing. It is a natural, effective, scientific treatment method that has been applied for two hundred years. The basic principle of homeopathy is \"Don't treat with like like\"[1]. Physicians such as Hippocrates and Ibn-i Sina also used and explained the same principle. Each element has only its own characteristics. The emergence of homeopathy as a treatment method was with the physician, pharmacist and chemist Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843, Germany), who is considered to be the father of this science [2]. \"Drugs reveal the symptoms they heal in a sick person in a healthy person.\" The basis of homeopathy; is to activate our life energy and enable our body to cope with diseases by activating the instinct of staying alive and being healthy. Classical medicine uses antidote as a treatment method, that is, substances that either reduce or prevent the growth of microorganisms, in short, antibiotics, analgesics, pain relievers, are given to the body. In homeopathy, the life energy is informed about how it can eliminate the disease [3, 5]. It is the homeopathic remedies that give this information. These remedies originate from nature, and the material from plants, metals, animals, secretions and sometimes the healed infection itself is the source of nearly 4,000 remedies. The most important thing in homeopathy is to have detailed information about the patient in the patient interview; to reveal the different symptoms and the ways of their emergence and differences. This information includes the general picture of the patient from birth; Affection, likes and dislikes, family history, sleeping habits, climatic or temporal complaints, in short, physical, spiritual and mental symptoms are learned and evaluated as a whole[5,6]. The patient's dreams, emotions, and behavioral patterns are learned and important or personal findings are determined and compared with the general characteristics of the remedies. While treating acute conditions, treatment for symptoms can be done, but the main thing is that the only structural drug is given in low doses to provide improvement [3]. The purpose here is; it is not just to eliminate the symptoms, but better to achieve real and lasting recovery. The findings of the patient and the drugs are compared and the appropriate drug is sought. If the findings of the patient and the drug are similar, it means the correct drug has been found. The basic rule of classical homeopathy is that one drug is given in the lowest dose. Goal; It is not to eliminate the symptoms, but to achieve permanent recovery. What many scientists find strange and find it hard to believe in the effect of homeopathy; Actually, there is no active substance in remedies, but the healing power of the substance continues because the teaching of that substance contains its energy mechanism of action. The more the drugs are diluted, the more intense the effect. For this reason, remedies have no side effects, but they will work if they are true and they will be able to reveal their own findings if they are wrong. This life force can be achieved without harming the person. Generally, homeopathy contributes significantly to the onset of chronic diseases and to preventing progression to chronicity. As an example of these pathologies; ulcerative colitis, sinusitis, asthma, allergic conditions, eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, and it is very effective especially in the first six months [5, 6]. More than 15,000 doctors are training in homeopathy in Brazil. [4] There are 162 schools about Hopeopathy in India, 200,000 doctors receive homeopathy training, and 100,000 people are known to use homeopathic remedies [8, 9]. Patients who applied to the GETAT center between 2018-2019 who received homeopathic treatment, especially those who received the banergy protocol, were screened. Case1: 17-year-old male patient, operated 3 years ago for meningioma, 7-year-old has no other characteristic except for a fracture in his leg. Epitoma was initiated by neurology (levetirosetam). Eating 3 meals a day, drinking approximately 600cc of water a day, walking for 1 hour a day without a sleep problem, having difficulty in saying the letters 'k and g', the lowest level of going to the toilet once a day was 70kg until now, his eyes have not seen since the operation.

When the patient with agitation and personality disorder did not get relief from physical therapy, the patient was started on Ruta C6, Calc Phosp D3, Camphora C200 according to the banergy protocol. He stopped drugs other than homeopathy and decreased to 2. 6 months later, an operation was performed on the mass that had shrunk radiologically. The patient whose pathology had astrocytoma was discharged after 3 days of intensive care treatment. The patient, who had no complaints for about 1 year, became pregnant and had a healthy male baby. A 9-year-old male patient with a midline glioblastoma tumor. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted in the patient who was operated by neurosurgery several times before.

He feels better emotionally now. Homeopathy is a non-toxic art of healing that treats the patient, not the disease, and restores the body's balance. It is a reliable and scientific treatment system based on medical principles. The word homeopathy is a combination of the words 'homoeos = like and' pathos '= disease' and is based 'treating like like' (Latin: 'similia similibus curentur'), one of the treatment principles defined by Hippocrates [1]. The German physician Samuel Hahnemann has made and developed this treatment principle, which has been known for centuries. The drugs used reveal the symptoms of the disease to be treated in healthy people, When given to the patient in lightened and diluted doses, these symptoms disappear. In other words, if any factor can make a person sick, it can also heal. These drugs, which have no toxic effects, can be of vegetable, animal and mineral origin and are prepared by a process called potentiation. These work by activating the body's self-healing power. Homeopathy, a natural remedy that has been used widely all over the world for 200 years system. It has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the second largest treatment method used worldwide. Although it is the most popular form of treatment in India and South America, it is also used by over 30 million people in Europe and millions of other people around the world [7]. Homoopathy treats the human as the mind, emotion and physical body. This is the breakdown in the system It happens that three systems are affected in turn. Treatment is done with the improvement of all of these. Treatment starts from the inside and therefore from the mind. The real power that keeps man alive is his life force. Without this power, there is no life and there is no healing [2]. For him, this power that keeps people alive is also the power that heals. While we are treating, we are actually giving a warning to this power. We are making this warning with potentized drugs. It makes us return to a healthy state, the life force that receives the warning and remembers its true mission. Special attention is paid to traditional and complementary medicine branches in India. In the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India, in March 1995, the Department of Indian Medical Systems and Homeopathy (Department of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy - ISM & H) first established a special focus on this issue. This section was rearranged at the general directorate level in November 2003 to focus on alternative medicine systems such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Greek, Siddha and Homeopathy, and the Department of \"Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy\" (The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga. and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy AYUSH). The department works on improving the AYUSH training standards, quality control and standardization of medicines, increasing the usefulness of medicinal plant materials, research and development (R&D), and raising awareness on the effectiveness of these systems in the domestic and international arena (7). Hahnemann's mission was to develop a method for treating rather than establishing a universal medical theory. Instead of suppressing symptoms, homeopathy guides patients to better health and therefore homeopathy has a promising future. Homeopathy relates to modern scientific paradigms such as systems theory, cybernetics, and semiology, rather than Cartesian and causal-mechanical thinking. Instead of making theoretical definitions of disease and treatment, Hahnemann created new contemporary definitions for his colleagues: life force, microbes (miasm), dynamic causes of disease, dynamic effects of cure, symptoms. Today's scientists, 19th century. should give up its terminology and include homeopathy in psychoneuro-endocrino-immunology, epigenetics, phenomenology, non-planarity, etc. should be conceptualized within the terms. Hahnemann's methods were applied for nearly 200 years, and even though some terms and concepts were controversial and excluded, he found appropriate and useful applications. Distinguishing the practical, theoretical, and metaphysical levels will open broad horizons to theoretical considerations and at the same time protect homeopathy from opposition based solely on theoretical concerns [10]. It has been shown that homeopathy can be used effectively in chronic diseases such as paralysis. [11] Complementary medicine methods, including homeopathy, are also used in cancer cases in many studies around the world [12]. In the literature, it is defined that complementary medicine methods solve many problems [13, 14]. In France, 34% of the patients have been found to use it in their treatment [16]. Homeopathy seems to be one of the most popular complementary medicine methods used by patients in the UK [17]. In a study where cancer patients were followed for 1 year, it was observed that the anxiety and depression scores of the homeopathy group were significantly lower [18]. The meta-analysis shows that cancer patients who use homeopathy in their treatment are quite high [19]. Anticancer effects of Chelidonium and Lycopodium, which are the remedies of homeopathy, have been shown [20, 21]. It has been determined that the homeopathic remedy of Sabal serrulata affects the growth of tumor cells biologically [22]. American studies have shown that homeopathic treatment reduces the tumor incidence by 23% and reduces the tumor volume by 38% [22]. It has been reported that it regresses liver tumor and decreases the incidence of sarcoma in experimental animal studies [23]. There are studies showing that it induces the apoptosis cascade by delaying the adenocarcino cell cycle in breast cancer [24]. It was found that Ruta and Calc Phosp, which are homeopathic remedies used in intracranial tumors, regressed the tumor in 15 cases with 6 glioma diagnosis without rt and ct [24)], we observed similar results in our cases. As a result, homeopathic remedies work like nano medicines. Nano drugs work like enzymes and can regulate them. Nano drugs can enter directly into DNA and RNA and can do epigenetic programming. It seems that the medicine and medicines of the future will be regulated by nano technology. Homeopathy is a treatment system that started nano medicine 200 years ago. Moreover, it is a treatment system that applies it individually.
