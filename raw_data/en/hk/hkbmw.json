We all lead busy lives, and today's stresses can play havoc on our bodies. Research has shown that a deep meditation of 20 minutes can be equivalent to 7 hours of a good nights sleep. Meditation benefits your body not only with relaxation, peace and happiness, but can reduce toxins in your body, strengthen your immune system and can even lower blood pressure!
