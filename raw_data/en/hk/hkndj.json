What are the research questions? What population are we interested in? What impact should our research make? What is the strategy for analysing survey findings? Were there limitations regarding our survey population? What is the strategy for disseminating survey findings?During the early days of the pandemic, a measure was needed to understand the effects of COVID -19 on brain tumour patients and their caregivers. The International Brain Tumour Alliance (IBTA) approached the Society for Neuro - Oncology about our concerns. SNO was very supportive. We also approached the University of Toronto neurosurgical colleagues. The IBTA joined the SNO COVID -19 Task Force and then carried out our anonymous online survey on how COVID -19 was affecting the international brain was developed by the IBTA in conjunction with the SNO COVID -19 Task Force. The survey was conducted over 39 days , from April 22ndto May 30th2020, inclusive. The survey was available in 7 languages (French, Italian, German, Polish, Japanese, English and Spanish) and contained both categorical and open -ended questions. 7Survey #1 -Background The survey was sent to over 120 brain tumour charities and not -for- profits worldwide to be disseminated to pediatric and adult brain tumour patients and their caregivers. The survey was also disseminated to an international range of neuro - oncology professionals around the world for forwarding to their patients and caregivers. 8Survey #1 -Responses 1,989 unique surveys were completed from 33countries. We had 1,459 patient responses -1284 adult patients -175 pediatric patients (with help from their parents/legal guardians). We had 530 caregiver responses. Over 30 different brain tumor types were represented in the survey. 9Survey #1 -Headline Findings During the early days of the pandemic, brain tumour patients and caregivers experienced increased stress and treatment delays. The most common and biggest fear for patients was a delay in their brain tumour -related appointments or treatment. Patient/caregiver priorities: there is a need for enhanced support and up -to- date, reliable, accessible information on how COVID would affect their treatment and prognosis. Patients and caregivers ranked physicians, brain tumour charities/not -for- profits as the most trusted sources of information. A significant increase in the caregiving burden was reported by 43% of caregivers.10 11 Survey #2: Brain Tumour Not -for-Profits & Charities Brain tumour not -for-profits and charities around the world have stepped in to provide crucial, amplified support to patients and caregivers. These organisations are also facing their own existential challenges. The IBTA's second survey -\"The Brain Tumour Not-for-Profit and Charity Experience of COVID - 19\" was published December 2020 highlighting these important issues. 12 IBTA Survey Timeline March 11, 2020 WHO declared COVID -19 a pandemic April -May 2020 IBTA Survey #1: Caregivers Vaccines and Survey 1314 Data as of 7thFebruary 2021Survey #3: COVID Vaccines and Brain Tumour Patients We used a similar development and format as the first two IBTA surveys. We sent out an online 31-question survey, in eight languages; the survey was conducted from June 30thto Aug 31st2021. We received 965 unique surveys from 43countries. 15 Survey #3 -Headline Findings At the time of this survey (summer 2021) 69% of brain tumour patients have been tested for COVID -19. Of those who have been tested, only 6%have tested positive. At the time of the survey, 85% of brain tumour patients had received one or both doses of a COVID vaccine. Boosters were not yet given at this point. 64% of patients who received the vaccine were prioritized in their countries , with the most common reason being that they have a brain tumour (31%). In summer 2021, the most common vaccine received by adult brain tumour patients was the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. 16 Survey #3 -Headline Findings 90% of brain tumour patients' caregivers received one/both doses of a COVID -19 vaccine. No major vaccine side effects were reported by any respondent. Good news! At the time of the survey, 7.5% of brain tumour patients decided not to get the vaccine. The largest concerns were: safety of the vaccines and whether the vaccines were effective. Another reason for vaccine hesitancy was lack of trust and worry about the effects of a vaccine on brain tumour diagnosis and/or treatment. In the survey, patients indicated that they want specific information on how the vaccines might directly impact their brain tumour and their treatment . 17 Limitations to our surveys: for example, the first and third IBTA surveys consisted of self -selected volunteers and there may be response bias in that the survey results may not be fully representative of the entire brain tumour patient and caregiver population such as those from ethnic minorities and low-income households.A final word about next steps We need to take a careful look at our healthcare systems and ensure that continuity and quality of care for rare cancer patients is protected. We need to use evolving data to determine which patients may be at greater risk from the impact of COVID -19. We need to build appropriate risk stratification into treatment pathways. 18Cancer doesn't stop because of a pandemic. We mustn't let brain tumours and other rare cancers become the forgotten \"C\" in the fight against COVID -19.Acknowledgements and thanks IBTA Senior Advisors and SNO COVID -19 Task Force for developing the survey questions Survey Review Group for final edits and review of the survey Brain tumour not -for-profits, charities and clinicians for disseminating the survey Translation support 19 www.theibta.org @theibta The International Brain Tumour Alliance "}
