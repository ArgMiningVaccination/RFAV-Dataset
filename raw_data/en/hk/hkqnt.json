The immune response from the vaccine is irreversible. It is impossible to remove a vaccine's contents from the body after it is injected. The immune response from the vaccine is irreversible. In a video making rounds on Instagram, an edited clip shows an interviewer saying that doctors claim fasting and organic vegetables can help \"cure\" the body from the COVID-19 vaccine and flush it out of the system. The source of this information or the doctors who have reportedly made this statement is never mentioned. The claim is baseless as the effects of vaccines are irreversible. Medical News Today quoted Dr. David Shafran, the head of pediatrics at K Health in Cleveland, OH, saying that the \"immune response from a vaccine is a protective one and cannot be reversed or undone.\" Virologist Angela Rasmussen told NBC News, \"Once you're injected, the lifesaving vaccination process has already begun. You can't unring a bell. It's just not physically possible.\" According to a report in Healthline, it is physically impossible to 'detox' a body from COVID-19 vaccines. The report quotes Jason Gallagher, a clinical professor of infectious diseases at Temple University in Philadelphia, saying, \"COVID-19 vaccines enter the body and begin their work quickly\". She said that even though there were materials to detox the body, the pace at which vaccines work would make it impossible. \"The mRNA vaccine is taken into the cells at the injection area, and the body reacts and produces [the materials to fight the COVID-19 cells]. It happens right there, and it happens quickly,\" she said. Foods like turmeric, ginger, green leafy vegetables, water-rich foods, and multi-grans are known to relieve one from basic after-effects of vaccines like fatigue, and a rise in body temperature. However, there is no evidence that organic vegetables can remove vaccines from the body. The Associated Press (AP) debunks a similar video claiming to remove the \"toxic\" vaccine content within 30 minutes of receiving a jab through cupping therapy. However, AP quoted Dr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley, saying that \"COVID-19 vaccines are injected deep and into muscle, and there is no way to remove a vaccine after the injection.\" According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 vaccines are intended to enable our immune system to mimic the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and protect our body if a person contracts the virus. These vaccines are injected directly into our muscles and cannot be cleansed by eating organic vegetables, taking a bath, using baking soda, or any therapy. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the COVID-19 vaccines undergo extensive trials on both animals and humans and rigorous laboratory development programs to ensure they are safe and effective. Considering there is no basis for the claim in this video, we mark it as false. "}
