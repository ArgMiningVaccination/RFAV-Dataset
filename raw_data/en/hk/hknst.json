Under a mandate of national environmental laws, the Agency strivesto formulate and implement actions leading to a compatible balance between human activities andthe ability of natural systems to support and nurture life. To meet these mandates, EPA's researchprogram is providing data and technical support for solving environmental problems today andbuilding a science knowledge base necessary to manage our ecological resources wisely, understandhow pollutants affect our health, and prevent or reduce environmental risks in the future. The National Risk Management Research Laboratory is the Agency's center for investigation of technological and management approaches for reducing risks from threats to human health andthe environment. The focus of the Laboratory's research program is on methods for the preventionand control of pollution to air, land, water, and subsurface resources; protection of water quality inpublic water systems; remediation of contaminated sites and ground water; and prevention andcontrol of indoor air pollution. The goal of this research effort is to catalyze development andimplementation of innovative, cost-effective environmental technologies; develop scientific andengineering information needed by EPA to support regulatory and policy decisions; and providetechnical support and information transfer to ensure effective implementation of environmentalregulations and strategies. The site characterization processes applied in the past are frequently inadequate to allow an objective and robust evaluation of natural attenuation. Before natural attenuation can be used in theremedy for contamination of ground water by chlorinated solvents, additional information is requiredon the three-dimensional flow field of contaminated ground water in the aquifer, and on the physical,chemical and biological processes that attenuate concentrations of the contaminants of concern.This document identifies parameters that are useful in the evaluation of natural attenuation ofchlorinated solvents, and provides recommendations to analyze and interpret the data collectedfrom the site characterization process. It will also allow ground-water remediation managers toincorporate natural attenuation into an integrated approach to remediation that includes an activeremedy, as appropriate, as well as natural attenuation.

Anaerobe : Organisms that do not require oxygen to live. Area of Attainment : The area over which cleanup levels will be achieved in the ground water. It encompasses the area outside the boundary of any waste remaining in place and up to the boundaryof the contaminant plume. Usually, the boundary of the waste is defined by the source controlremedy. Note: this area is independent of property boundaries or potential receptors - it is theplume area which the ground water must be returned to beneficial use during the implementation ofa remedy. Anthropogenic : Man-made. Autotrophs : Microorganisms that synthesize organic materials from carbon dioxide. Catabolism : The process whereby energy is extracted from organic compounds by breaking them down into their component parts. Coefficient of Variation : Sample standard deviation divided by the mean. Cofactor: A small molecule required for the function of an enzyme. Cometabolism: The process in which a compound is fortuitously degraded by an enzyme or cofactor produced during microbial metabolism of another compound.

Effective Porosity : The percentage of void volume that contributes to percolation; roughly equivalent to the specific yield. Electron Acceptor : A compound capable of accepting electrons during oxidation-reduction reactions. Microorganisms obtain energy by transferring electrons from electron donors such as organiccompounds (or sometimes reduced inorganic compounds such as sulfide) to an electron acceptor.Electron acceptors are compounds that are relatively oxidized and include oxygen, nitrate,iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate, carbon dioxide, or in some cases the chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbons such as perchloroethene (PCE), TCE, DCE, and vinyl chloride. Electron Donor : A compound capable of supplying (giving up) electrons during oxidation-reduction reactions. Microorganisms obtain energy by transferring electrons from electron donors such asorganic compounds (or sometimes reduced inorganic compounds such as sulfide) to an electronacceptor. Electron donors are compounds that are relatively reduced and include fuelhydrocarbons and native organic carbon. Electrophile : A reactive species that accepts an electron pair.

Lithotroph : Organism that uses inorganic carbon such as carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as a carbon source and an external source of energy. Mechanical Dispersion : A physical process of mixing along a flow path in an aquifer resulting from differences in path length and flow velocity. This is in contrast to mixing due to diffusion. Metabolic Byproduct : A product of the reaction between an electron donor and an electron acceptor. Metabolic byproducts include volatile fatty acids, daughter products of aliphatichydrocarbons, methane, and chloride. Monooxygenase : A microbial enzyme that catalyzes reactions in which one atom of the oxygen molecule is incorporated into a product and the other atom appears in water. Nucleophile : A chemical reagent that reacts by forming covalent bonds with electronegative atoms and compounds. Obligate Aerobe : Microorganisms that can use only oxygen as an electron acceptor. Thus, the presence of molecular oxygen is a requirement for these microbes. Obligate Anaerobes : Microorganisms that grow only in the absence of oxygen; the presence of molecular oxygen either inhibits growth or kills the organism. For example, methanogens are very sensitiveto oxygen and can live only under strictly anaerobic conditions.

When these processes areshown to be capable of attaining site-specific remediation objectives in a time period that is reasonablecompared to other alternatives, they may be selected alone or in combination with other moreactive remedies as the preferred remedial alternative. Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) is aterm that refers specifically to the use of natural attenuation processes as part of overall siteremediation. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) defines monitorednatural attenuation as (OSWER Directive 9200.4-17, 1997): The term \"monitored natural attenuation,\" as used in this Directive, refers to the reliance on natural attenuation processes (within the context of a carefullycontrolled and monitored clean-up approach) to achieve site-specific remedialobjectives within a time frame that is reasonable compared to other methods. The\"natural attenuation processes\" that are at work in such a remediation approachinclude a variety of physical, chemical, or biological processes that, under favorableconditions, act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility,volume, or concentration of contaminants in soil and ground water. These in-situprocesses include, biodegradation, dispersion, dilution, sorption, volatilization, andchemical or biological stabilization, transformation, or destruction of contaminants. Monitored natural attenuation is appropriate as a remedial approach only when it can be demonstrated capable of achieving a site's remedial objectives withina time frame that is reasonable compared to that offered by other methods andwhere it meets the applicable remedy selection program for a particular OSWERprogram. EPA, therefore, expects that monitored natural attenution typically willbe used in conjunction with active remediation measures (e.g., source control), oras a follow-up to active remediation measures that have already been implemented. The intent of this document is to present a technical protocol for data collection and analysis to evaluate monitored natural attenuation through biological processes for remediating groundwater contaminated with mixtures of fuels and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons. This documentfocuses on technical issues and is not intended to address policy considerations or specific regulatoryor statutory requirements. In addition, this document does not provide comprehensive guidance on overall site characterization or long-term monitoring of MNA remedies. Users of this protocol should realize that different Federal and State remedial programs may have somewhat differentremedial objectives. For example, the CERCLA and RCRA Corrective Action programs generallyrequire that remedial actions: 1) prevent exposure to contaminated ground water, above acceptablerisk levels; 2) minimize further migration of the plume; 3) minimize further migration ofcontaminants from source materials; and 4) restore the plume to cleanup levels appropriate forcurrent or future beneficial uses, to the extent practicable. Achieving such objectives could oftenrequire that MNA be used in conjunction with other \"active\" remedial methods. For other cleanupprograms, remedial objectives may be focused on preventing exposures above acceptable levels.Therefore, it is imperative that users of this document be aware of and understand the Federal and2State statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as policy considerations that apply to a specific site for which this protocol will be used to evaluate MNA as a remedial option. As a generalpractice (i.e., not just pertaining to this protocol), individuals responsible for evaluating remedialalternatives should interact with the overseeing regulatory agency to identify likely characterizationand cleanup objectives for a particular site prior to investing significant resources. The policyframework within which MNA should be considered for Federal cleanup programs is described inthe November 1997 EPA Directive titled, \"Use of Monitored Natural Attenuation at Superfund,RCRA Corrective Action and Underground Storage Tank Sites\" (Directive No. 9200.4-17). This protocol is designed to evaluate the fate in ground water of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons and/or fuel hydrocarbons. Because documentation of natural attenuation requiresdetailed site characterization, the data collected under this protocol can be used to compare therelative effectiveness of other remedial options and natural attenuation. This protocol should beused to evaluate whether MNA by itself or in conjunction with other remedial technologies issufficient to achieve site-specific remedial objectives. In evaluating the appropriateness of MNA,the user of this protocol should consider both existing exposure pathways, as well as exposurepathways arising from potential future uses of the ground water. This protocol is aimed at improving the characterization process for sites at which a remedy involving monitored natural attenuation is being considered. It contains methods and recommendedstrategies for completing the remedial investigation process. Emphasis is placed on developing amore complete understanding of the site through the conceptual site model process, early pathwaysanalysis, and evaluation of remedial processes to include MNA. Understanding the contaminantflow field in the subsurface is essential for a technically justified evaluation of an MNA remedialoption; therefore, use of this protocol is not appropriate for evaluating MNA at sites where thecontaminant flow field cannot be determined with an acceptable degree of certainty (e.g., complexfractured bedrock, karst aquifers). In practice, natural attenuation also is referred to by several other names, such as intrinsic remediation, intrinsic bioremediation, natural restoration, or passive bioremediation. The goal ofany site characterization effort is to understand the fate and transport of the contaminants of concernover time in order to assess any current or potential threat to human health or the environment.Natural attenuation processes, such as biodegradation, can often be dominant factors in the fate andtransport of contaminants. Thus, consideration and quantification of natural attenuation is essentialto a more thorough understanding of contaminant fate and transport. 1.1 APPROPRIATE APPLICATION ON NATURAL ATTENUATION The intended audience for this document includes Project Managers and their contractors, scientists, consultants, regulatory personnel, and others charged with remediating ground watercontaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons andchlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons. This protocol is intended to be used within the establishedregulatory framework appropriate for selection of a remedy at a particular hazardous waste site(e.g., the nine-criteria analysis used to evaluate remedial alternatives in the CERCLA remedyselection process). It is not the intent of this document to replace existing U.S. EPA or state-specific guidance on conducting remedial investigations. The EPA does not consider monitored natural attenuation to be a default or presumptive remedy at any contaminated site (OSWER Directive 9200.4-17, 1997), as its applicability is highlyvariable from site to site. In order for MNA to be selected as a remedy, site-specific determinations3will always have to be made to ensure that natural attenuation is sufficiently protective of human health and the environment. Natural attenuation in ground-water systems results from the integration of several subsurface attenuation mechanisms that are classified as either destructive or nondestructive. Biodegradationis the most important destructive attenuation mechanism, although abiotic destruction of somecompounds does occur. mechanisms dispersion, and volatilization. natural attenuation of fuel hydrocarbons is described in theTechnical Protocol for Implementing Intrinsic Remediation with Long-Term Monitoring for NaturalAttenuation of Fuel Contamination Dissolved in Groundwater, published by the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) (Wiedemeier et al., 1995d). This document differs from the technical protocol for intrinsic remediation of fuel hydrocarbons because it focuses on theindividual processes of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon biodegradation which are fundamentallydifferent from the processes involved in the biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons. For example, biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons, especially benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), is mainly limited by electron acceptor availability, and generally will proceeduntil all of the contaminants biochemically accessible to the microbes are destroyed. In the experienceof the authors, there appears to be an adequate supply of electron acceptors in most, if not all,hydrogeologic environments. On the other hand, the more highly chlorinated solvents such asperchloroethene (PCE) and under natural reductive dechlorination, process that requires both electron acceptors (the chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbons) and an adequate supply of electron donors. Electron donors include fuel hydrocarbonsor other types of anthropogenic carbon (e.g., landfill leachate) or natural organic carbon. If thesubsurface environment is depleted of electron donors before the chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbonsare removed, biological reductive dechlorination will cease, and natural attenuation may no longerbe protective of human health and the environment. This is the most significant difference betweenthe processes of fuel hydrocarbon and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. For this reason, it is more difficult to predict the long-term behavior of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon plumes than fuel hydrocarbon plumes. Thus, it is important to have a goodunderstanding of the important natural attenuation mechanisms. Data collection should include allpertinent parameters to evaluate the efficacy of natural attenuation. In addition to having a betterunderstanding of the processes of advection, dispersion, dilution from recharge, and sorption, it isnecessary to better quantify biodegradation. This of the interactionsbetween hydrocarbons, anthropogenic or natural carbon, and inorganic electronacceptors at the site. Detailed site characterization is required to adequately document and understandthese processes. The long-term monitoring strategy should consider the possibility that the behaviorof a plume may change over time and monitor for the continued availability of a carbon source tosupport reductive dechlorination. An understanding of the attenuation mechanisms is also important to characterizing exposure pathways. After ground water plumes come to steady state, sorption can no longer be an importantattenuation mechanism. The most important mechanisms will be biotransformation, dischargethrough advective flow, and volatilization. As an example, Martin and Imbrigiotta (1994) calibrateda detailed transport and fate model to a release of pure TCE at Picatinny Arsenal, in New Jersey.The plume was at steady state or declining. Ten years after surface spills ceased, leaching ofcontaminants from subsurface DNAPLs and desorption from fine-grained layers were the onlyprocesses identified that continued to contribute TCE to ground water. Desorption of TCE occurred4at a rate of 15 to 85 mg/second. Anaerobic biotransformation consumed TCE at a rate of up to 30 mg/second, advective flow and discharge of TCE to surface water accounted for up to 2 mg/second, and volatilization of TCE accounted for 0.1 mg/second. In this case, recharge ofuncontaminated water drove the plume below the water table, which minimized the opportunity forvolatization to the unsaturated zone. As a result, discharge to surface water was the only importantexposure pathway. Volatilization will be more important at sites that do not have significantrecharge to the water table aquifer, or that have NAPLs at the water table that contain chlorinatedorganic compounds. Chlorinated solvents are released into the subsurface as either aqueous-phase or nonaqueous phase liquids. Typical solvent releases include nonaqueous phase relatively pure solvents that aremore dense than water and aqueous rinseates. Additionally, a release may occur as a mixture offuel hydrocarbons or sludges and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons which, depending on therelative proportion of each compound group, may be more or less dense than water. If the NAPLis more dense than water, the material is referred to as a \"dense nonaqueous-phase liquid,\" orDNAPL. If the NAPL is less dense than water the material is referred to as a \"light nonaqueous-phase liquid,\" or LNAPL. Contaminant presentas mobile NAPL (NAPL occurring at sufficiently high saturations to drain under the influence ofgravity into a well) and residual NAPL (NAPL occurring at immobile, residual saturations that areunable to drain into a well by gravity). In general, the greatest mass of contaminant is associatedwith these NAPL source areas, not with the aqueous phase. When released at the surface, NAPLs move downward under the force of gravity and tend to follow preferential pathways such as along the surface of sloping fine-grained layers or throughfractures in soil or rock. Large NAPL releases can extend laterally much farther from the releasepoint than would otherwise be expected, and large DNAPL releases can sink to greater depths thanexpected by following preferential flow paths. Thus, the relative volume of the release and potentialmigration pathways should be considered when developing the conceptual model for the distributionof NAPL in the subsurface. As water moves through NAPL areas (recharge in the vadose zone or ground water flow in an aquifer), the more soluble constituents partition into the water to generate a plume of dissolvedcontamination and the more volatile contaminants partition to the vapor phase. After surfacereleases have stopped, NAPLs remaining in the subsurface tend to \"weather\" over time as volatileand soluble components are depleted from NAPL surfaces. Even considering this \"weathering\"effect, subsurface NAPLS continue to be a source of contaminants to ground water for a very longtime. For this reason, identification and delineation of subsurface zones containing residual orfree-phase NAPL is an important aspect of the site conceptual model to be developed for evaluatingMNA or other remediation methods. Removal, treatment or containment of NAPLs may be necessary for MNA to be a viable remedial option or to decrease the time needed for natural processes to attain site-specific remediationobjectives. In cases where removal of mobile NAPL is feasible, it is desirable to remove thissource material and decrease the time required to reach cleanup objectives. Where removal ortreatment of NAPL is not practical, source containment may be practicable and necessary for MNAto be a viable remedial option. 1.2 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES In comparison to engineered remediation technologies, remedies relying on monitored natural attenuation have the following advantages and disadvantages, as identified in OSWER Directive59200.4-17, dated November 1997. (Note that this an iterim, not a final, Directive which was released by EPA for use. Readers are cautioned to consult the final version of this Directive when it becomesavailable.)The advantages of monitored natural attenuation (MNA) remedies are: As with any in situ process, generation of lesser volume of remediation wastes reduced potential for cross-media transfer of contaminants commonly associated with ex situ treatment, andreduced risk of human exposure to contaminated media; Less intrusion as few surface structures are required; Potential for application to all or part of a given site, depending on site conditions and cleanup objectives; Use in conjunction with, or as a follow-up to, other (active) remedial measures; andLower overall remediation costs than those associated with active remediation. The potential disadvantages of monitored natural attenuation (MNA) include: Longer time frames may be required to achieve remediation objectives, compared to active remediation; Site characterization may be more complex and costly; Toxicity of transformation products may exceed that of the parent compound; Long-term monitoring will generally be necessary; Institutional controls may be necessary to ensure long-term protectiveness; Potential exists for continued contamination migration, and/or cross-media transfer of contaminants; Hydrologic and geochemical conditions amenable to natural attenuation are likely to change over time and could result in renewed mobility of previously stabilized contaminants, adverselyimpacting remedial effectiveness; and More extensive education and outreach efforts may be required in order to gain public acceptance of monitored natural attenuation. At some sites the same geochemical conditions and processes that lead to biodegradation of chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons can chemically transform naturally occurringmanganese, arsenic and other metals in the aquifer matrix, producing forms of these metals thatare more mobile and/or more toxic than the original materials. A comprehensive assessment ofrisk at a hazardous waste site should include sampling and analysis for these metals. This document describes (1) those processes that bring about natural attenuation, (2) the site characterization activities that may be performed to conduct a full-scale evaluation of naturalattenuation, (3) mathematical modeling of natural attenuation using analytical or numerical solutefate and transport models, and (4) the post-modeling activities that should be completed to ensuresuccessful evaluation and verification of remediation by natural attenuation. The objective is toquantify and provide defensible data to evaluate natural attenuation at sites where naturally occurringsubsurface attenuation processes are capable of reducing dissolved chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbonand/or fuel hydrocarbon concentrations to acceptable levels. A comment made by a member of theregulatory community summarizes what is required to successfully implement natural attenuation: A regulator looks for the data necessary to determine that a proposed treatment technology, if properly installed and operated, will reduce the contaminantconcentrations in the soil and water to legally mandated limits. In this sense, theuse of biological treatment systems calls for the same level of investigation,6demonstration of effectiveness, and monitoring as any conventional [remediation] system (National Research Council, 1993). When the rate of natural attenuation of site contaminants is sufficient to attain site-specific remediation objectives in a time period that is reasonable compared to other alternatives, MNAmay be an appropriate remedy for the site. This document presents a technical course of action thatallows converging lines of evidence to be used to scientifically document the occurrence of naturalattenuation and quantify the rate at which it is occurring. Such a \"weight-of-evidence\" approachwill greatly increase the likelihood of successfully implementing natural attenuation at sites wherenatural processes are restoring the environmental quality of ground water. 1.3 LINES OF EVIDENCE The OSWER Directive 9200.4-17 (1997) identifies three lines of evidence that can be used to estimate natural attenuation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, including: (1) Historical ground water and/or soil chemistry data that demonstrate a clear and meaningful trend of decreasing contaminant mass and/or concentration over time at appropriate monitoring or sampling points. (In the case of a ground water plume, decreasingconcentrations should not be solely the result of plume migration. In the case of inorganiccontaminants, the primary attenuating mechanism should also be understood.) (2) Hydrogeologic and geochemical data that can be used to demonstrate indirectly the type(s) of natural attenuation processes active at the site, and the rate at which such processeswill reduce contaminant concentrations to required levels. For example, characterizationdata may be used to quantify the rates of contaminant sorption, dilution, or volatilization, or to demonstrate and quantify the rates of biological degradation processes occurring at the site. (3) Data from field or microcosm studies (conducted in or with actual contaminated site media) which directly demonstrate the occurrence of a particular natural attenuation process at the site and its ability to degrade the contaminants of concern (typically used to demonstrate biological degradation processes only). The OSWER Directive provides the following guidance on interpreting the lines of evidence: Unless EPA or the implementing state agency determines that historical data (Number 1 above) are of sufficient quality and duration to support a decisionto use monitored natural attenuation, EPA expects that data characterizing thenature and rates of natural attenuation processes at the site (Number 2 above)should be provided. Where the latter are also inadequate or inconclusive, datafrom microcosm studies (Number 3 above) may also be necessary. In general, more supporting information may be required to demonstrate the efficacy ofmonitored natural attenuation at those sites with contaminants which do not readilydegrade through biological processes (e.g., most non-petroleum compounds,inorganics), at sites with contaminants that transform into more toxic and/or mobileforms than the parent contaminant, or at sites where monitoring has been performedfor a relatively short period of time. The amount and type of information needed forsuch a demonstration will depend upon a number of site-specific factors, such as thesize and nature of the contamination problem, the proximity of receptors and thepotential risk to those receptors, and other physical characteristics of theenvironmental setting (e.g., hydrogeology, ground cover, or climatic conditions).7The first line of evidence does not prove that contaminants are being destroyed. Reduction in contaminant concentration could be the result of advection, dispersion, dilution from recharge,sorption, and volatilization (i.e., the majority of apparent contaminant loss could be due to dilution).However, this line of evidence is critical for determining if any exposure pathways exist for currentor potential future receptors. In order to evaluate remediation by natural attenuation at most sites, the investigator will have to determine whether contaminant mass is being destroyed. This is done using either, orboth, of the second or third lines of evidence. The second line of evidence relies on chemical andphysical data to show that contaminant mass is being destroyed, not just being diluted or sorbed tothe aquifer matrix. For many contaminants, biodegradation is the most important process, but forcertain contaminants nonbiological reactions are also important. The second line of evidence isdivided into two components: Using chemical analytical data in mass balance calculations to show that decreases in contaminant and electron acceptor/donor concentrations can be directly correlated toincreases in metabolic end products/daughter compounds. This evidence can be used toshow that electron acceptor/donor concentrations in ground water are sufficient to facilitate degradation of dissolved contaminants. Solute fate and transport models can be used to aid mass balance calculations and to collate and present information on degradation. Using measured concentrations of contaminants and/or biologically recalcitrant tracers in conjunction with aquifer hydrogeologic parameters such as seepage velocity and dilution to show that a reduction in contaminant mass is occurring at the site and to calculate biodegradation rate constants. The biodegradation rate constants are used in conjunction with the other fate and transport parameters to predict contaminant concentrations and to assess risk at downgradient performance evaluation wells and within the area of the dissolved plume. Microcosm studies may be necessary to physically demonstrate that natural attenuation is occurring. Microcosm studies can also be used to show that indigenous biota are capable of degradingsite contaminants at a particular rate. Microcosm studies for the purpose of developing rate constants should only be undertaken when they are the only means available to obtain biodegradation rate estimates. There are two important categories of sites where it is difficult or impossible toextract rate constants from concentrations of contaminants in monitoring wells in the field. Insome sites, important segments of the flow path to receptors are not accessible to monitoring becauseof landscape features (such as lakes or rivers) or property boundaries that preclude access to a sitefor monitoring. In other sites that are influenced by tides, or the stage of major rivers, or groundwater extraction wells, the ground water plume trajectory changes so rapidly that it must be describedin a statistical manner. A \"snapshot\" round of sampling cannot be used to infer the plume velocityin calculations of the rate of attenuation. 1.4 SITE CHARACTERIZATION The OSWER Directive 9200.4-17 (1997) describes EPA requirements for adequate site characterization. Decisions to employ monitored natural attenuation as a remedy or remedy component should be thoroughly and adequately supported with site-specificcharacterization data and analysis. In general, the level of site characterization necessary to support a comprehensive evaluation of natural attenuation is moredetailed than that needed to support active remediation. Site characterizations for8natural attenuation generally warrant a quantitative understanding of source mass; ground water flow; contaminant phase distribution and partitioning between soil,ground water, and soil gas; rates of biological and non-biological transformation;and an understanding of how all of these factors are likely to vary with time. Thisinformation is generally necessary since contaminant behavior is governed bydynamic processes which must be well understood before natural attenuation canbe appropriately applied at a site. Demonstrating the efficacy of this remediationapproach likely will require analytical or numerical simulation of complexattenuation processes. Such analyses, which are critical to demonstrate naturalattenuation's ability to meet remedial action objectives, generally require a detailedconceptual site model as a foundation. A conceptual site model is a three-dimensional representation that conveys what is known or suspected about contamination sources, release mechanisms, andthe transport and fate of those contaminants. The conceptual model provides thebasis for assessing potential remedial technologies at the site. \"Conceptual sitemodel\" is not synonymous with \"computer model;\" however, a computer model may be helpful for understanding and visualizing current site conditions or forpredictive simulations of potential future conditions. Computer models, whichsimulate site processes mathematically, should in turn be based upon soundconceptual site models to provide meaningful information. Computer models typicallyrequire a lot of data, and the quality of the output from computer models is directlyrelated to the quality of the input data. Because of the complexity of natural systems,models necessarily rely on simplifying assumptions that may or may not accuratelyrepresent the dynamics of the natural system. Site characterization should include collecting data to define (in three spatial dimensions over time) the nature and distribution of contamination sources as wellas the extent of the ground water plume and its potential impacts on receptors.However, where monitored natural attenuation will be considered as a remedialapproach, certain aspects of site characterization may require more detail oradditional elements. For example, to assess the contributions of sorption, dilution,and dispersion to natural attenuation of contaminated ground water, a very detailedunderstanding of aquifer hydraulics, recharge and discharge areas and volumes,and chemical properties is required. Where biodegradation will be assessed,characterization also should include evaluation of the nutrients and electron donorsand acceptors present in the ground water, the concentrations of co-metabolitesand metabolic by-products, and perhaps specific analyses to identify the microbialpopulations present. The findings of these, and any other analyses pertinent tocharacterizing natural attenuation processes, should be incorporated into theconceptual model of contaminant fate and transport developed for the site. Development of an adequate database during the iterative site characterization process is an important step in the documentation of natural attenuation. Site characterization should providedata on the location, nature, phase distribution, and extent of contaminant sources. Sitecharacterization also should provide information on the location, extent, and concentrations ofdissolved contamination; ground water geochemical data; geologic anddistribution of and hydrogeologic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity,9hydraulic gradients, and potential contaminant migration pathways to human or ecological receptor exposure points. The data collected during site characterization can be used to simulate the fate and transport of contaminants in the subsurface. Such simulation allows prediction of the future extent andconcentrations of the dissolved contaminant plume. Several types of models can be used to simulatedissolved contaminant transport and attenuation. The natural attenuation modeling effort has five primary objectives: To evaluate whether MNA will be likely to attain site-specific remediation objectives in a time period that is reasonable compared to other alternatives; To predict the future extent and concentration of a dissolved contaminant plume by simulating the combined effects of contaminant loading, advection, dispersion, sorption, and biodegradation; To predict the most useful locations for ground-water monitoring; To assess the potential for downgradient receptors to be exposed to contaminant concentrations that exceed regulatory or risk-based levels intended to be protective of human health and the environment; and To provide technical support for remedial options using MNA during screening and detailed evaluation of remedial alternatives in a CERCLA Feasibility Study or RCRA CorrectiveMeasures Study. Upon completion of the fate and transport modeling effort, model predictions can be used to evaluate whether MNA is a viable remedial alternative for a given site. If the transport and fatemodels predict that natural attenuation is sufficient to attain site-specific remediation objectivesand will be protective of human health and the environment, natural attenuation may be anappropriate remedy for the site. Model assumptions and results should be verified by data obtainedfrom site characterization. If model assumptions and results are not verified by site data, MNA isnot likely to be a viable option and should not be proposed as the remedy. 1.5 MONITORING The Monitoring Program OSWER Directive on Monitored Natural Attenuation (9200.4-17) describes EPA expectations for performance monitoring. Performance monitoring to evaluate remedy effectiveness and to ensure protection of human health and the environment is a critical element of all responseactions. Performance monitoring is of even greater importance for monitored naturalattenuation than for other types of remedies due to the longer remediation timeframes, potential for ongoing contaminant migration, and other uncertaintiesassociated with using monitored natural attenuation. This emphasis is underscoredby EPA's reference to \"monitored natural attenuation\". The monitoring program developed for each site should specify the location, frequency, and type of samples and measurements necessary to evaluate remedyperformance as well as define the anticipated performance objectives of the remedy.In addition, all monitoring programs should be designed to accomplish the following: Demonstrate that natural attenuation is occurring according to expectations; Identify any potentially toxic transformation products resulting from biodegradation; Determine if a plume is expanding (either downgradient, laterally or vertically); Ensure no impact to downgradient receptors; Detect new releases of contaminants to the environment that could impact the10effectiveness of the natural attenuation remedy; Demonstrate the efficacy of institutional controls that were put in place to protect potential receptors; Detect changes in environmental conditions (e.g., hydrogeologic, geochemical, microbiological, or other changes) that may reduce the efficacy of any of thenatural attenuation processes; and Verify attainment of cleanup objectives. Detection of changes will depend on the proper siting and construction of monitoring wells/points. Although the siting of monitoring wells is a concern forany remediation technology, it is of even greater concern with monitored naturalattenuation because of the lack of engineering controls to control contaminantmigration. Performance monitoring should continue as long as contamination remains above required cleanup levels. Typically, monitoring is continued for a specified period (e.g., one to three years) after cleanup levels have been achieved toensure that concentration levels are stable and remain below target levels. Theinstitutional and financial mechanisms for maintaining the monitoring programshould be clearly established in the remedy decision or other site documents, asappropriate. Natural attenuation is achieved when naturally occurring attenuation mechanisms, such as biodegradation, bring about a reduction in the total mass, toxicity, mobility, volume, or concentrationof a contaminant dissolved in ground water. In some cases, natural attenuation processes will becapable of attaining site-specific remediation objectives in a time period that is reasonable comparedto other alternatives. However, at this time, the authors are not aware of any sites where naturalattenuation alone has succeeded in restoring ground water contaminated with chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbons to drinking water quality over the entire plume. The material presented here was prepared through the joint effort between the Bioremediation Research Team at the Subsurface Protection and Remediation Division of U.S. EPA's NationalRisk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) in Ada, Oklahoma, and the U.S. Air ForceCenter for Environmental Excellence, Technology Transfer Division, Brooks Air Force Base,Texas, and Parsons Engineering Science, Inc. (Parsons ES). It is designed to facilitate properevaluation of remedial alternatives including natural attenuation at large chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbon-contaminated sites. This information is the most current available at the time of this writing. The scientific knowledge and experience with natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents is growing rapidly andthe authors expect that the process for evaluating natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents willcontinue to evolve. This document contains three sections, including this introduction. Section 2 presents the protocol to be used to obtain scientific data to evaluate the natural attenuation option. Section 3presents the references used in preparing this document. Appendix A describes the collection ofsite characterization data necessary to evaluate natural attenuation, and provides soil and ground-water sampling procedures and analytical protocols. Appendix B provides an in-depth discussionof the destructive and nondestructive mechanisms of natural attenuation. Appendix C covers datainterpretation and pre-modeling calculations.11SECTION 2 PROTOCOL FOR EVALUATING NATURAL ATTENUATION The primary objective of the natural attenuation investigation is to determine whether natural processes will be capable of attaining site-specific remediation objectives in a time period that isreasonable compared to other alternatives. Further, natural attenuation should be evaluated todetermine if it can meet all appropriate Federal and State remediation objectives for a given site.This requires that projections of the potential extent of the contaminant plume in time and space bemade. These projections should be based on historic variations in contaminant concentration, andthe current extent and concentrations of contaminants in the plume in conjunction with measuredrates of contaminant attenuation. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with such predictions,it is the responsibility of the proponent of monitored natural attenuation to provide sufficient evidenceto demonstrate that the mechanisms of natural attenuation will meet the remediation objectivesappropriate for the site. This can be facilitated by using conservative parameters in solute fate andtransport models and numerous sensitivity analyses in order to better evaluate plausible contaminantmigration scenarios. When possible, both historical data and modeling should be used to provideinformation that collectively and consistently confirms the natural reduction and removal of thedissolved contaminant plume. Figure 2.1 outlines the steps involved in a natural attenuation demonstration and shows the important regulatory decision points for implementing natural attenuation. For example, a SuperfundFeasibility Study is a two-step process that involves initial screening of potential remedial alternativesfollowed by more detailed evaluation of alternatives that pass the screening step. A similar processis followed in a RCRA Corrective Measures Study and for sites regulated by State remediationprograms. The key steps for evaluating natural attenuation are outlined in Figure 2.1 and include: 1) Review available site data and develop a preliminary conceptual model. Determine if receptor pathways have already been completed. Respond as appropriate. 2) If sufficient existing data of appropriate quality exist, apply the screening process de- scribed in Section 2.2 to assess the potential for natural attenuation. 3) If preliminary site data suggest natural attenuation is potentially appropriate, perform additional site characterization to further evaluate natural attenuation. If all the recom-mended screening parameters listed in Section 2.2 have been collected and the screeningprocesses suggest that natural attenuation is not appropriate based on the potential fornatural attenuation, evaluate whether other processes can meet the cleanup objectives forthe site (e.g., abiotic degradation or transformation, volatilization, or sorption) or select aremedial option other than MNA. 4) Refine conceptual model based on site characterization data, complete pre-modeling calculations, and document indicators of natural attenuation. 5) Simulate, if necessary, natural attenuation using analytical or numerical solute fate and transport models that allow incorporation of a biodegradation term. 6) Identify potential receptors and exposure points and conduct an exposure pathways analy- sis. 7) Evaluate the need for supplemental source control measures. Additional source control may allow MNA to be a viable remedial option or decrease the time needed for naturalprocesses to attain remedial objectives.12Figure 2.1 Natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents flow chart.138) Prepare a long-term monitoring and verification plan for the selected alternative. In some cases, this includes monitored natural attenuation alone, or in other cases in concert withsupplemental remediation systems. 9) Present findings of natural attenuation studies in an appropriate remedy selection docu- ment, such as a CERCLA Feasibility or RCRA Corrective Measures Study. The appropri-ate regulatory agencies should be consulted early in the remedy selection process to clarifythe remedial objectives that are appropriate for the site and any other requirements that theremedy will be expected to meet. However, it should be noted that remedy requirementsare not finalized until a decision is signed, such as a CERCLA Record of Decision or aRCRA Statement of Basis. The following sections describe each of these steps in more detail. 2.1 REVIEW AVAILABLE SITE DATA AND DEVELOP PRELIMINARY CONCEPTUAL MODEL The first step in the natural attenuation investigation is to review available site-specific data. Once this is done, it is possible to use the initial site screening processes presented in Section 2.2 todetermine if natural attenuation is a viable remedial option. A thorough review of these data alsoallows development of a preliminary conceptual model. The preliminary conceptual model willhelp identify any shortcomings in the data and will facilitate placement of additional data collectionpoints in the most scientifically advantageous and cost-effective manner possible. The following site information should be obtained during the review of available data. Information that is not available for this initial review should be collected during subsequent siteinvestigations when refining the site conceptual model, as described in Section 2.3. Nature, extent, and magnitude of contamination: - Nature and history of the contaminant release: --Catastrophic or gradual release of NAPL ? --More than one source area possible or present ?--Divergent or coalescing plumes ? - Three-dimensional distribution of dissolved contaminants and mobile and residual NAPLs. Often high concentrations of chlorinated solvents in ground water are the result of landfill leachates, rinse waters, or ruptures of water conveyance pipes. For LNAPLsthe distribution of mobile and residual NAPL will be used to define the dissolved plumesource area. For DNAPLs the distribution of the dissolved plume concentrations, in addition to any DNAPL will be used to define the plume source area. - Ground water and soil chemical data.- Historical water quality data showing variations in contaminant concentrations both vertically and horizontally. - Chemical and physical characteristics of the contaminants. - Potential for biodegradation of the contaminants.- Potential for natural attenuation to increase toxity and/or mobility of natural occurring metals. Geologic and hydrogeologic data in three dimensions (If these data are not available, they should be collected for the natural attenuation demonstration and for any other remedial investigation or feasibility study): - Lithology and stratigraphic relationships.- Grain-size distribution (gravels vs. sand vs. silt vs. clay).14- Aquifer hydraulic conductivity (vertical and horizontal, effectiveness of aquitards, calculation of vertical gradients). - Ground-water flow gradients and potentiometric or water table surface maps (over several seasons, if possible). - Preferential flow paths. - Interactions between ground water and surface water and rates of infiltration/recharge. Locations of potential receptor exposure points: - Ground water production and supply wells, and areas that can be deemed a potential source of drinking water. - Downgradient and crossgradient discharge points including any discharges to surface waters or other ecosystems. - Vapor discharge to basements and other confined spaces. In some cases, site-specific data are limited. If this is the case, all future site characterization activities should include collecting the data necessary to screen the site for the use of monitorednatural attenuation as a potential site remedy. Much of the data required to evaluate natural attenuationcan be used to design and evaluate other remedial measures. Available site characterization data should be used to develop a conceptual model for the site. This conceptual model is a three-dimensional representation of the source area as a NAPL orregion of highly contaminated ground water, of the surrounding uncontaminated area, of groundwater flow properties, and of the solute transport system based on available geological, biological,geochemical, hydrological, climatological, and analytical data for the site. Data on the contaminantlevels and aquifer characteristics should be obtained from wells and boreholes which will providea clear three-dimensional picture of the hydrologic and geochemical characteristics of the site.High concentrations of dissolved contaminants can be the result of leachates, rinse waters andrupture of water conveyance lines, and are not necessarily associated with NAPLs. This type of conceptual model differs from the conceptual site models commonly used by risk assessors that qualitatively consider the location of contaminant sources, release mechanisms,transport pathways, exposure points, and receptors. However, the conceptual model of the groundwater system facilitates identification of these risk-assessment elements for the exposure pathwaysanalysis. After development, the conceptual model can be used to help determine optimal placementof additional data collection points, as necessary, to aid in the natural attenuation investigation andto develop the solute fate and transport model. Contracting and management controls must beflexible enough to allow for the potential for revisions to the conceptual model and thus the datacollection effort. Successful conceptual model development involves: Definition of the problem to be solved (generally the three dimensional nature, magnitude, and extent of existing and future contamination). Identification of the core or cores of the plume in three dimensions. The core or cores contain the highest concentration of contaminants. Integration and presentation of available data, including: - Local geologic and topographic maps, - Geologic data,- Hydraulic data,- Biological data, - Geochemical data, and - Contaminant concentration and distribution data.15 Determination of additional data requirements, including: - Vertical profiling locations, boring locations and monitoring well spacing in three dimensions, - A sampling and analysis plan (SAP), and- Any data requirements listed in Section 2.1 that have not been adequately addressed. Table 2.1 contains the recommended soil and ground water analytical methods for evaluating the potential for natural attenuation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons and/or fuel hydrocarbons.Any plan to collect additional ground water and soil quality data should include the analytes listedin this table. Table 2.2 lists the availability of these analyses and the recommended data qualityrequirements. Since required procedures for field sampling, analytical methods and data qualityobjectives vary somewhat among regulatory programs, the methods to be used at a particular siteshould be developed in collaboration with the appropriate regulatory agencies. There are manydocuments which may aid in developing data quality objectives (e.g.,U.S. EPA Order 5360.1 andU.S. EPA QA/G-4 Guidance for the Data Quality Objectives Process). 2.2 INITIAL SITE SCREENING After reviewing available site data and developing a preliminary conceptual model, an assessment of the potential for natural attenuation must be made. As stated previously, existingdata can be useful to determine if natural attenuation is capable of attaining site-specific remediationobjectives in a time period that is reasonable compared to other alternatives. This is achieved byfirst determining whether the plume is currently stable or migrating and the future extent of theplume based on (1) contaminant properties, including volatility, sorptive properties, andbiodegradability; (2) aquifer properties, including hydraulic gradient, hydraulic conductivity, porosityand concentrations of native organic material in the sediment (TOC), and (3) the location of theplume and contaminant source relative to potential receptor exposure points (i.e., the distance betweenthe leading edge of the plume and the potential receptor exposure points). These parameters(estimated or actual) are used in this section to make a preliminary assessment of the effectivenessof natural attenuation in reducing contaminant concentrations. If, after completing the steps outlined in this section, it appears that natural attenuation will be a significant factor in contaminant removal and a viable remedial alternative, detailed sitecharacterization activities that will allow evaluation of this remedial option should be performed.If exposure pathways have already been completed and contaminant concentrations exceed protectivelevels, or if such completion is likely, an engineered remedy is needed to prevent such exposuresand should be implemented as an early action. For this case, MNA may still be appropriate to attainlong-term remediation objectives for the site. Even so, the collection of data to evaluate naturalattenuation can be integrated into a comprehensive remedial strategy and may help reduce the costand duration of engineered remedial measures such as intensive source removal operations or pump-and-treat technologies. 2.2.1 Overview of Chlorinated Aliphatic Hydrocarbon Biodegradation Because biodegradation is usually the most important destructive process acting to reduce contaminant concentrations in ground water, an accurate estimate of the potential for naturalbiodegradation is important to consider when determining whether ground water contaminationpresents a substantial threat to human health and the environment. This information also will beuseful when selecting the remedial alternative that will be most cost effective at eliminating orabating these threats should natural attenuation alone not prove to be sufficient.16Matrix Analysis Method/Reference Comments Data UseRecommended Frequency of AnalysisSample Volume, Sample Container, SamplePreservationField or Fixed-BaseLaboratory Soil Aromatic and Chlorinatedhydrocarbons(benzene,toluene,ethylbenzene, andxylene [BTEX];ChlorinatedCompoundsSW8260A Data are used to determine the extent ofsoil contamination, thecontamination masspresent, and thepotential for sourceremoval.Each soil sampling roundSample volume approximately 100 ml;subsample and extract inthe field using methanolor appropriate solvent;cool to extraction followed byquantification used whenfuel orvinyl chloride arepresent in of fuelhydrocarbons andvinyl chloride via sampling in fiveborings, five coresfrom each boringMinimum 1 inch diameter core samplescollected into plasticliner.

Whereas fuel hydrocarbons arebiodegraded through use as a primary substrate (electron donor), chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbonsmay undergo biodegradation under three different circumstances: intentional use as an electronacceptor; intentional use as an electron donor; or, through cometabolism where degradation of thechlorinated organic is fortuitous and there is no benefit to the microorganism. At a given site, oneor all of these circumstances may pertain, although at many sites the use of chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbons as electron acceptors appears to be most important under natural conditions. In thiscase, biodegradation of chlorinated aliphatic is an electron-acceptor-limited process. In an uncontaminated aquifer, native organic carbon is used as an electron donor, and dissolved oxygen (DO) is used first as the prime electron acceptor. Where anthropogenic carbon (e.g., as fuelhydrocarbons) is present, it also will be used as an electron donor. After the DO is consumed,anaerobic microorganisms typically use additional electron acceptors (as available) in the followingorder of preference: nitrate, ferric iron oxyhydroxide, sulfate, and finally carbon dioxide. Evaluationof the distribution of these electron acceptors can provide evidence of where and how chlorinatedaliphatic hydrocarbon biodegradation is occurring. In addition, because chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbons may be used as electron acceptors or electron donors (in competition with otheracceptors or donors), isopleth maps showing the distribution of these compounds and their daughterproducts can provide evidence of the mechanisms of biodegradation working at a site. As withBTEX, the driving force behind oxidation-reduction reactions resulting in chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbon degradation is electron transfer. Although thermodynamically favorable, most of thereactions involved in chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon reduction and oxidation do not proceedabiotically. Microorganisms are capable of carrying out the reactions, but they will facilitate onlythose oxidation-reduction reactions that have a net yield of energy. 2.2.1.1 Mechanisms of Chlorinated Aliphatic Hydrocarbon Biodegradation The following sections describe the biodegradation of those compounds that are most prevalent and whose behavior is best understood. 2.2.1.1.1 Electron Acceptor Reactions (Reductive Dehalogenation) The most important process for the natural biodegradation of the more highly chlorinated solvents is reductive dechlorination. During this process, the chlorinated hydrocarbon is used as anelectron acceptor, not as a source of carbon, and a chlorine atom is removed and replaced with ahydrogen atom. Figure 2.2 illustrates the transformation of chlorinated ethenes via reductivedechlorination. In to VC to ethene. Depending upon environmental conditions, this sequence may beinterrupted, with other processes then acting upon the products. During reductive dechlorination,all three isomers of DCE can theoretically be produced. However, Bouwer (1994) reports thatunder the influence of biodegradation, cis-1,2-DCE is a more common intermediate than trans-1,2- DCE, and that 1,1-DCE is the least prevalent of the three DCE isomers when they are present asdaughter products. Reductive dechlorination chlorinated solvent 2.2 Reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes.25the accumulation of daughter products and an increase in the concentration of chloride ions. Reductive dechlorination affects each of the chlorinated ethenes these compounds, PCE is themost susceptible to reductive dechlorination because it is the most oxidized. Conversely, VC is theleast susceptible to reductive dechlorination because it is the least oxidized of these compounds.As a result, the rate of reductive dechlorination decreases as the degree of chlorination decreases(Vogel and McCarty, 1985; Bouwer, 1994). Murray and Richardson (1993) have postulated thatthis rate decrease may explain the accumulation of VC and TCE plumes that been demonstrated under nitrate- and iron-reducing conditions, but the most rapid biodegradation rates, affecting the widest range of chlorinatedaliphatic hydrocarbons, sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions (Bouwer, hydrocarbon compounds are used as electron acceptors during reductivedechlorination, there must be an appropriate source of carbon for microbial growth in order for thisprocess to occur (Bouwer, 1994). Potential carbon sources include natural organic matter, fuelhydrocarbons, or other anthropogenic organic compounds such as those found in landfill leachate. 2.2.1.1.2 Electron Donor Reactions Murray and Richardson (1993) write that microorganisms are generally believed to be incapable of growth using PCE and TCE as a primary substrate (i.e., electron donor). However, under aerobicand some anaerobic conditions, the less oxidized chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., VC) canbe used as in biologically mediated oxidation-reduction reactions (McCartyand Semprini, 1994). In this type of reaction, the facilitating microorganism obtains energy andorganic carbon from the degraded chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon. In contrast to reactions inwhich the chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon is used as an electron acceptor, only the least oxidizedchlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons can be used as electron donors in biologically mediated oxidation-reduction reactions. McCarty and Semprini (1994) describe investigations in which VC and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) were shown to serve as primary substrates under aerobic conditions. Theseauthors also document that dichloromethane has the potential to function as a primary substrateunder either aerobic or anaerobic environments. In addition, Bradley and Chapelle (1996) showevidence of mineralization of VC under iron-reducing conditions so long as there is sufficientbioavailable iron (III). Aerobic metabolism of VC may be characterized by a loss of VC mass anda decreasing molar ratio of VC to other chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds. In addition,Klier et al. ( 1998) and Bradley and Chapelle (1997) show mineralization of DCE to carbon dioxide under aerobic, Fe(III) reducing, and methanogenic conditions, respectively. 2.2.1.1.3 Cometabolism When a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon is biodegraded via the degradation is catalyzed by an enzyme or cofactor that is fortuitously produced by the organisms for otherpurposes. The organism receives no known benefit from the degradation of the chlorinated aliphatichydrocarbon. Rather, the cometabolic degradation of the chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon may infact be harmful to the microorganism responsible for the production of the enzyme or cofactor(McCarty and Semprini, 1994). Cometabolism is best documented in aerobic environments, althoughit potentially could occur under anaerobic conditions. It has been reported that under aerobicconditions chlorinated ethenes, with the exception of PCE, degradation(Murray and Richardson, McCarty and Vogel (1994) furtherelaborates that the rate of cometabolism increases as the degree of dechlorination decreases. Duringcometabolism, the chlorinated alkene is indirectly transformed by bacteria as they use BTEX or26another substrate to meet their energy requirements. Therefore, the chlorinated alkene does not enhance the degradation of BTEX or other carbon sources, nor will its cometabolism interfere withthe use of electron acceptors involved in the oxidation of those carbon sources. 2.2.1.2 Behavior of Chlorinated Solvent Plumes Chlorinated solvent plumes can exhibit three types of behavior depending on the amount of solvent, the amount of biologically available organic carbon in the aquifer, the distribution andconcentration of natural electron acceptors, and the types of electron acceptors being used. Individualplumes may exhibit all three types of behavior in different portions of the plume. The differenttypes of plume behavior are summarized below. 2.2.1.2.1 Type 1 Behavior Type 1 behavior occurs where the primary substrate is anthropogenic carbon (e.g., BTEX or landfill leachate), and microbial degradation of this anthropogenic carbon drives reductivedechlorination. When evaluating natural attenuation of a plume exhibiting Type 1 behavior, thefollowing questions must be answered: 1) Is the electron donor supply adequate to allow microbial reduction of the chlorinated organic compounds? In other words, will the microorganisms \"strangle\" before they\"starve\" (i.e., will they run out of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons used as electronacceptors before they run out of anthropogenic carbon used as the primary substrate)? 2) What is the role of competing electron acceptors (e.g., dissolved oxygen, nitrate, iron (III) and sulfate)? 3) Is VC oxidized, or is it reduced? Appendices B and C discuss what these questions mean and how they are answered. Type 1 behavior results in the rapid and extensive degradation of the more highly-chlorinated solventssuch as PCE, TCE, and DCE. 2.2.1.2.2 Type 2 Behavior Type 2 behavior dominates in areas that are characterized by relatively high concentrations of biologically available native organic carbon. Microbial utilization of this natural carbon sourcedrives reductive dechlorination (i.e., it is the primary substrate for microorganism growth). Whenevaluating natural attenuation of a Type 2 chlorinated solvent plume, the same questions as thoseposed in the description of Type 1 behavior must be answered. Type 2 behavior generally results inslower biodegradation of the highly chlorinated solvents than Type 1 behavior, but under the rightconditions (e.g., areas with high natural organic carbon contents), this type of behavior also canresult in rapid degradation of these compounds. 2.2.1.2.3 Type 3 Behavior Type 3 behavior dominates in areas that are characterized by inadequate concentrations of native and/or anthropogenic carbon, and concentrations of dissolved oxygen that are greater than1.0 mg/L. Under these aerobic conditions, reductive dechlorination will not occur. The mostsignificant natural attenuation advection, dispersion,and sorption. However, VC can be rapidly oxidized under these conditions. Type 3 behavior alsooccurs in ground water that does not contain microbes capable of biodegradation of chlorinatedsolvents.272.2.1.2.4 Mixed Behavior As mentioned above, a single chlorinated solvent plume can exhibit all three types of behavior in different portions of the plume. This can be beneficial for natural biodegradation of chlorinatedaliphatic hydrocarbon plumes. For example, Wiedemeier et al. (1996a) describe a plume at Plattsburgh AFB, New York, that exhibits Type 1 behavior in the source area and Type 3 behaviordowngradient from the source. The most fortuitous scenario involves a plume in which PCE, TCE,and DCE are reductively dechlorinated with accumulation of VC near the source area (Type 1 orType 2 behavior), then VC is oxidized (Type 3 behavior), either aerobically or via iron reductionfurther downgradient. Vinyl chloride is oxidized to carbon dioxide in this type of plume and doesnot accumulate. The following sequence of reactions occurs in a plume that exhibits this type ofmixed behavior. PCETCEDCEVCCarbon Dioxide In general, TCE, DCE, and VC may attenuate at approximately the same rate, and thus these reactions may be confused with simple dilution. Note that no ethene is produced during this reaction.Vinyl chloride is removed from the system much faster under these conditions than it is under VC-reducing conditions. A less desirable scenario, but one in which all contaminants may be entirely biodegraded, involves a plume in which all chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons are reductively dechlorinated viaType 1 or Type 2 behavior. Vinyl chloride is reduced to ethene, which may be further reduced toethane or methane. The following sequence of reactions occurs in this type of plume. PCE TCE DCEVCEtheneEthane This sequence has been investigated by Freedman and Gossett (1989). In this type of plume, VC degrades more slowly than TCE, and thus tends to accumulate. 2.2.2 Bioattenuation Screening Process An accurate assessment of the potential for natural biodegradation of chlorinated compounds should be made before investing in a detailed study of natural attenuation. The screening processpresented in this section is outlined in Figure 2.3. This approach should allow the investigator todetermine if natural bioattenuation of PCE, TCE, DCE, TCA, and chlorobenzenes is likely to be aviable remedial alternative before additional time and money are expended. If the site is regulatedunder CERCLA, much of the data required to make the preliminary assessment of natural attenuationwill be used to evaluate alternative engineered remedial solutions as required by the NCP. Table 2.3presents the analytical screening criteria. For most of the chlorinated solvents, the initial biotransformation in the environment is a reductive dechlorination. The initial screening process is designed to recognize geochemicalenvironments where reductive dechlorination is plausible. It is recognized, however, thatbioodegradation of certain halogenated compounds can also proceed via ethylene The following information is required for the screening process: The chemical and geochemical data presented in Table 2.3 for background and target areas of the plume as depicted in Figure 2.4. Figure 2.4 shows the schematic locations ofthese data collection points. Note: If other contaminants are suspected, then data on the concentrations and distribution of these compounds also should be obtained. Locations of source(s) and potential points of exposure. If subsurface NAPLs are sources, estimate extent of residual and free-phase NAPL. An estimate of the transport velocity and direction of ground-water flow.28Figure 2.3 Initial screening process flow chart.29AnalysisConcentration in Most Contaminated Zone Interpretation Value Oxygen* <0.5 mg/L -3 Nitrate* <1 mg/L At higher concentrations may Iron II* >1 mg/L Reductive conditions3 Sulfate* <20 mg/L At higher likely1 2 pH* 5 < pH < 9 5 > pH >9Optimal range for reductive pathway Outside optimal range for reductive pathway0 -2 TOC > 20 mg/L Carbon and energy source; drives dechlorination; can be natural or anthropogenic2 Temperature* > 20oCA t T > 2 0oC biochemical process is accelerated 1 Carbon Dioxide >2x background Ultimate oxidative daughter product 1 Alkalinity >2x background Results from interaction between CO 2 and aquifer minerals 1 Chloride* >2x background Daughter product of organic chlorine 2 Hydrogen >1 nM Reductive pathway possible, VC may accumulate 3 Hydrogen <1 nM VC oxidized 0 Volatile Fatty Acids > 0.1 mg/L Intermediates resulting from biodegradation of more complex compounds; carbon and energy source2 BTEX* > 0.1 mg/L Carbon and energy source; drives dechlorination 2 Tetrachloroethene Material released 0 Trichloroethene* Material released Daughter product of PCE0 2a/ DCE* Material released Daughter product of TCEIf cis is > 80% of total DCE it is likely a daughter product 1,1-DCE can be chemical reaction product of TCA0 2a/ VC* Material released Daughter product of DCE0 2a/ 1,1,1-Trichloroethane* Material released 0 DCA Daughter product of TCA under reducing conditions 2 Carbon Tetrachloride Material released 0 Chloroethane* Daughter product of DCA or VC under reducing conditions 2 Ethene/Ethane >0.01mg/L >0.1 mg/LDaughter product of VC/ethene 2 3 Chloroform Material released Daughter product of Carbon Tetrachloride0 2 Dichloromethane Material released Daughter product of Chloroform0 2 * Required analysis. a/ Points awarded only if it can be shown that the compound is a daughter product (i.e., not a constitue nt of the source NAPL).Table 2.3 Analytical Parameters and Weighting for Preliminary Screening for Anaerobic Biodegradation Processesa/30Once these data have been collected, the screening process can be undertaken. The following steps summarize the screening processes: 1) Determine if biodegradation is occurring using geochemical data. If biodegradation is occurring, proceed to step 2. If it is not, assess the amount and types of data available. Ifdata are insufficient to determine if biodegradation is occurring, collect supplemental data.If all the recommended screening parameters listed in section 2.2 have been collected andthe screening processes suggest that natural attenuation is not appropriate, the screeningprocesses are finished. Perform site characterization to evaluate other remediation alterna-tives. 2) Determine ground-water flow and solute transport parameters from representative field data. Dispersivity and porosity may be estimated from literature but the hydraulic conduc-tivity and the ground-water gradient and flow direction must be determined from fielddata. The investigator should use the highest valid hydraulic conductivity measured at thesite during the preliminary screening because solute plumes tend to follow the path ofleast resistance (i.e., highest hydraulic conductivity). This will give the \"worst-case\"estimate of the solute migration distance over a given period of time. Compare this\"worst-case\" estimate with the rate of plume migration determined from site characteriza-tion data. Determine what degree of plume migration is accepable or unacceptable withrespect to site-specific remediation objectives. 3) Locate source(s) and potential points of exposure. If subsurface NAPLs are sources, estimate extent of residual and free-phase NAPL. 4) Estimate the biodegradation rate constant. Biodegradation rate constants can be estimated using a conservative tracer found commingled with the contaminant plume, as describedin Appendix C and by Wiedemeier et al. (1996b). When dealing with a plume that con- tains chlorinated solvents, this procedure can be modified to use chloride as a tracer. Rateconstants derived from microcosm studies can also be used when site specific field dataare inadequate or inconclusive. If it is not possible to estimate the biodegradation rateusing these procedures, then use a range of accepted literature values for biodegradation ofthe contaminants of concern. Appendix C presents a range of biodegradation rate con-stants for various compounds. Although literature values may be used to estimatebiogradation rates in the bioattenuation screening process described in Section 2.2, litera-ture values should not be used in the later more detailed analysis of natural attenuation,described in Section 2.3. 5) Compare the rate of transport to the rate of attenuation. Use analytical solutions or a screening model such as BIOSCREEN. 6) Determine if screening criteria are met. Step 1: Determine if Biodegradation is Occurring The first step in the screening process is to sample or use existing data for the areas represented in Figure 2.4 and analyze them for the parameters listed in Table 2.3 (see also Section 2.3.2). Theseareas should include (1) the most contaminated portion of the aquifer (generally in the \"source\"area with NAPL or high concentrations of contaminants in ground water ; (2) downgradient fromthe source area but still in the dissolved contaminant plume; (3) downgradient from the dissolvedcontaminant plume; and (4) upgradient and lateral locations that are not impacted by the plume.Although this figure is a simplified two-dimensional representation of the features of a contaminantplume, real plumes are three-dimensional objects. The sampling should be conducted in accordancewith Appendix A.31The sample collected in the NAPL source area provides information as to the predominant terminal electron-accepting process at the source area. In conjunction with the sample collected inthe NAPL source zone, samples collected in the dissolved plume downgradient from the NAPLsource zone allow the investigator (1) to determine if the plume is degrading with distance alongthe flow path and (2) to determine the distribution of electron acceptors and donors and metabolicby-products along the flow path. The sample collected downgradient from the dissolved plumeaids in plume delineation and allows the investigator to determine if metabolic byproducts arepresent in an area of ground water that has been remediated. The upgradient and lateral samplesallow delineation of the plume and determination of background concentrations of the electronacceptors and donors. After these samples have been analyzed for the parameters listed in Table 2.3, the investigator should analyze the data to determine if biodegradation is occurring. The right-hand column ofTable 2.3 contains scoring values that can be used as a test to assess the likelihood that biodegradationis occurring. This method relies on the fact that biodegradation will cause predictable changes inground water chemistry. For example, if the dissolved oxygen concentration in the area of theplume with the highest contaminant concentration is less than 0.5 milligrams per liter (mg/L), 3points are awarded. Table 2.4 summarizes the range of possible scores and gives an interpretationfor each score. If the score totals 15 or more points, it is likely that biodegradation is occurring, andthe investigator should proceed to Step 2.Figure 2.4 Target areas for collecting screening data. Note that the number and location of monitoring wells will vary with the three dimensional complexity of the plume(s).32Table 2.4 Interpretation of Points Awarded During Screening Step 1 Score Interpretation 0 to 5 Inadequate evidence for anaerobic biodegradation* of chlorinated organics 6 to 14 Limited evidence for anaerobic biodegradation* of chlorinated organics 15 to 20 Adequate evidence for anaerobic biodegradation* of chlorinated organics > of chlorinated organics *reductive dechlorination The following two examples illustrate how Step 1 of the screening process is implemented. The site used in the first example is a former fire training area contaminated with chlorinatedsolvents mixed with fuel hydrocarbons. The presence of the fuel hydrocarbons appears to reducethe ORP of the ground water to the extent that reductive dechlorination is favorable. The secondexample contains data from a dry cleaning site contaminated only with chlorinated solvents. Thissite was contaminated with spent cleaning solvents that were dumped into a shallow dry well situatedjust above a well-oxygenated, unconfined aquifer with low organic carbon concentrations of dissolvedorganic carbon. Example 1: Strong Evidence for Anaerobic Biodegradation (Reductive Dechlorination) of Chlorinated Organics Analyte Concentration in Most Contaminated Zone Points Awarded Dissolved Oxygen 0.1 mg/L 3 Nitrate 0.3 mg/L 2 Iron (II) 10 mg/L 3 Sulfate 2 mg/L 2 Methane 5 mg/L 3 ORP -190 mV 2 Chloride 3 times background 2 PCE (released) 1,000 \u00b5g/L 0 TCE (none released) 1,200 \u00b5g/L 2 cis-DCE (none released) 500 \u00b5g/L 2 VC (none released) 50 \u00b5g/L 2 Total Points Awarded 23 Points In this example, the investigator can infer that biodegradation is likely occurring at the time of sampling and may proceed to Step 2. Example 2: Anaerobic Biodegradation (Reductive Dechlorination) Unlikely Analyte Concentration in Most Contaminated Zone Points Awarded Dissolved Oxygen 3 mg/L -3 Nitrate 0.3 mg/L 2 Iron (II) Not Detected (ND) 0 Sulfate 10 mg/L 2 Methane ND 0 ORP + 100 mV 0 Chloride background 0 TCE (released) 1,200 \u00b5g/L 0 cis-DCE (none released) ND 0 VC (none released) ND 0 Total Points Awarded 1 Point33In this example, the investigator can infer that biodegradation is probably not occurring or is occurring too slowly to contribute to natural attenuation at the time of the sampling. In this case,the investigator should evaluate whether other natural attenuation processes can meet the cleanupobjectives for the site (e.g., abiotic degradation or transformation, volatilization or sorption) orselect a remedial option other than MNA. Step 2: Determine Ground-water Flow and Solute Transport Parameters After it has been shown that biodegradation is occurring, it is important to quantify ground- water flow and solute transport parameters. This will make it possible to use a solute transportmodel to quantitatively estimate the concentration of the plume and its direction and rate of travel.To use an analytical model, it is necessary to know the hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivityfor the site and to have estimates of porosity and dispersivity. It also is helpful to know the coefficientof retardation. Quantification of these parameters is discussed in detail in Appendix B. In order to make the modeling as accurate as possible, the investigator must have site-specific hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity data. To determine the ground-water flow and solutetransport direction, it is necessary to have at least three accurately surveyed wells in eachhydrogeologic unit of interest at the site. The porosity and dispersivity are generally estimatedusing accepted literature values for the aquifer matrix materials containing the plume at the site. Ifthe investigator has total organic carbon data for soil, it is possible to estimate the coefficient ofretardation; otherwise, it is conservative to assume that the solute transport and ground-watervelocities are the same. Techniques to collect these data are discussed in the appendices. Step 3: Locate Sources and Receptor Exposure Points To determine the length of flow for the predictive modeling to be conducted in Step 5, it is important to know the distance between the source of contamination, the leading edge along thecore of the dissolved plume, and any potential downgradient or cross-gradient receptor exposurepoints. Step 4: Estimate the Biodegradation Rate Biodegradation is the most important process that degrades contaminants in the subsurface; therefore, the biodegradation rate is one of the most important model input parameters.Biodegradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons can be represented as a first-order rate constant.Whenever possible, use site-specific biodegradation rates estimated from field data collected alongthe core of the plume. Calculation of site-specific biodegradation rates is discussed in Appendix C.If it is not possible to determine site-specific biodegradation rates, then literature values may beused in a sensitivity analysis (Table C.3.5). A useful approach is to start with average values, andthen to vary the model input to predict \"best-case\" and \"worst-case\" scenarios. Estimatedbiodegradation rates can be used only after it has been shown that biodegradation is occurring (seeStep 1). Although literature values may be used to estimate biodegradation rates in the bioattenuationscreening process described in Section 2.2, additional site information should be collected todetermine biodegradation rates for the site when refining the site conceptual model, as described inSection 2.3. Literature values should not be used during the more detailed analysis. Step 5: Compare the Rate of Transport to the Rate of Attenuation At this early stage in the natural attenuation demonstration, comparison of the rate of solute transport to the rate of attenuation is best accomplished using an analytical model. Several modelsare available. It is suggested that the decay option be first order for use in any of the models. The primary purpose of comparing the rate of transport to the rate of natural attenuation is to determine if natural attenuation processes will be capable of attaining site-specific remediationobjectives in a time period that is reasonable compared to other alternatives (i.e., to quantitatively34estimate if site contaminants are attenuating at a rate fast enough to prevent further plume migration and restore the plume to appropriate cleanup levels). The analytical model BIOSCREEN can beused to determine whether natural attenuation processes will be capable of meeting site-specificremediation objectives at some distance downgradiant of a source. The numerical model BIOPLUMEIII can be used to estimate whether site contaminants are attenuating at a rate fast enough to restorethe plume to appropriate cleanup levels It is important to perform a sensitivity analysis to helpevaluate the confidence in the preliminary screening modeling effort. For the purposes of the screening ef fort, if modeling shows that the screening criteria are met, the investigator can proceed with the natural attenuation evaluation. Step 6: Determine if Screening Criteria are Met Before proceeding with the full-scale natural attenuation evaluation, the investigator should ensure that the answers to both of the following questions are \"yes\": Has the plume moved a shorter distance than would be expected based on the known (or estimated) time since the contaminant release and the contaminant velocity in groundwater, as calculated from site-specific measurements of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient, and estimates of effective porosity and contaminant retardation? Is it likely that site contaminants are attenuating at rates sufficient to meet remediation objectives for the site in a time period that is reasonable compared to other alternatives? If the answers to these questions are \"yes,\" then the investigator is encouraged to proceed with the full-scale natural attenuation demonstration. 2.3 COLLECT ADDITIONAL SITE CHARACTERIZATION DATA TO EVALUATE NATURAL ATTENUATION AS REQUIRED It is the responsibility of the proponent to \"make the case\" for natural attenuation. Thus, a credible and thorough site assessment is necessary to document the potential for natural attenuationto meet cleanup objectives. As discussed in Section 2.1, review of existing site characterizationdata is particularly useful before initiating site characterization activities. Such review shouldallow identification of data gaps and guide the most effective placement of additional data collectionpoints. There are two goals during the site characterization phase of a natural attenuation investigation. The first is to collect the data needed to determine if natural mechanisms of contaminant attenuationare occurring at rates sufficient to attain site-specific remediation objectives in a time period that isreasonable compared to other alternatives. The second is to provide sufficient site-specific data toallow prediction of the future extent and concentrations of a contaminant plume through solute fateand transport modeling. Thus, detailed site characterization is required to achieve these goals andto support this remedial option. Adequate site characterization in support of natural attenuationrequires that the following site-specific parameters be determined: Location, nature, and extent of contaminant source area(s) (i.e., areas containing mobile or residual NAPL or highly contaminated ground water). Chemical properties (e.g., composition, solubility, volatility, etc.) of contaminant source materials. The potential for a continuing source due to sewers, leaking tanks, or pipelines, or other site activity. Extent and types of soil and ground-water contamination. Aquifer geochemical parameters (Table 2.1).35Regional hydrogeology, including: - Drinking water aquifers, and - Regional confining units. Local and site-specific hydrogeology, including: - Local drinking water aquifers; - Location of industrial, agricultural, and domestic water wells; - Patterns of aquifer use (current and future); - Lithology;- Site stratigraphy, including identification of transmissive and nontransmissive units;- Potential pathways for NAPL migration (e.g., surface topography and dip of confining layers); - Grain-size distribution (sand vs. silt vs. clay); - Aquifer hydraulic conductivity;- Ground water hydraulic information; - Preferential flow paths; - Locations and types of surface water bodies; and- Areas of local ground water recharge and discharge. Identification of current and future potential exposure pathways, receptors, and exposure points. Many chlorinated solvent plumes have enough three-dimensional expression to make it impossible for a single well to adequately describe the plume at a particular location on a map ofthe site. Figure 2.5 depicts a cross section of a hypothetical site with three-dimensional expression of the plume. A documented source exists in the capillary fringe just above the water table. Suchsources are usually found by recovering, extracting, and analyzing core material. This material canbe (1) a release of LNAPL containing chlorinated solvents; (2) a release of pure chlorinated solventsthat has been entrapped by capillary interactions in the capillary fringe; or (3) material that hasexperienced high concentrations of solvents in solution in ground water, has sorbed the solvents,and now is slowly desorbing the chlorinated solvents. Recharge of precipitation through this sourceproduces a plume that appears to dive into the aquifer as it moves away from the source. This effectcan be caused by recharge of clean ground water above the plume as it moves downgradient of thesource, by collection of the plume into more hydraulically conductive material at the bottom ofaquifer, or by density differences between the plume and the unimpacted ground water. Below the first hydrologic unit there is a second unit that has fine-textured material at the top and coarse-textured material at the bottom of the unit. In the hypothetical site, the fine-texturedmaterial at the top of the second unit has inhibited downward migration of a DNAPL, causing it tospread laterally at the bottom of the first unit and form a second source of ground-water contaminationin the first unit. Because DNAPL below the water table tends to exist as diffuse and widely extendedganglia rather than of pools filling all the pore space, it is statistically improbable that the materialsampled by conventional core sampling will contain DNAPL. Because these sources are so difficultto sample, these sources are cryptic to conventional sampling techniques. At the hypothetical site, DNAPL has found a pathway past the fine-textured material and has formed a second cryptic source area at the bottom of the second hydrologic unit. Compare Figure 2.6.The second hydrological unit at the hypothetical site has a different hydraulic gradient than the firstunit. As a result, the plume in the second unit is moving in a different direction than the plume inthe first unit. Biological processes occurring in one hydrological unit may not occur in another; aplume may show Type 2 behavior in one unit and Type 3 behavior in another.36Figure 2.6 A stacked plan representation of the plumes that may develop from the hypothetical release depicted in Figure 2.5. Each plan representation depicts a separate plume that canoriginate from discrete source areas produced from the same release of chlorinated solvents.Figure 2.5 A cross section through a hypothetical release, illustrating the three-dimensional character of the plumes that may develop from a release of chlorinated solvents. Cryptic NAPLDocumented NAPL37As a consequence, it is critical to sample and evaluate the three-dimensional character of the site with respect to (1) interaction of contaminant releases with the aquifer matrix material, (2)local hydological features that control development and migration of plumes, and (3) the geochemicalinteractions that favor bioattenuation of chlorinated solvents. The following sections describe the methodologies that should be implemented to allow successful site characterization in support of natural attenuation. 2.3.1 Characterization of Soils and Aquifer Matrix Materials In order to adequately define the subsurface hydrogeologic system and to determine the three- dimensional distribution of mobile and residual NAPL that can act as a continuing source of ground-water contamination, credible and thorough soil characterization must be completed. As appropriate,soil gas data may be collected and analyzed to better characterize soil contamination in the vadosezone. Depending on the status of the site, this work may have been completed during previousremedial investigation work. The results of soils characterization will be used as input into a solutefate and transport model to help define a contaminant source term and to support the naturalattenuation investigation. The purpose of sampling soil and aquifer matrix material is to determine the subsurface distribution of hydrostratigraphic units and the distribution of mobile and residual NAPL, as wellas pore water that contains high concentrations of the contaminants in the dissolved phase. Theseobjectives can be achieved through the use of conventional soil borings or direct-push methods(e.g., Geoprobe\u00ae or cone penetrometer testing), and through collection of soil gas samples. Allsamples should be collected, described, analyzed, and disposed of in accordance with local, State,and Federal guidance. Appendix A contains suggested procedures for sample collection. Theseprocedures may require modification to comply with local, State, and Federal regulations or toaccommodate site-specific conditions. The analytical methods to be used for soil, aquifer matrix material, and soil gas sample analyses is presented in Table 2.1. This table includes all of the parameters necessary to document naturalattenuation, including the effects of sorption, volatilization, and biodegradation. Each analyte isdiscussed separately below. Volatile Organic Compounds : Knowledge of the location, distribution, concentration, and total mass of contaminants sorbed to soils or present as mobile or immobile NAPL isrequired to calculate contaminant partitioning from NAPL into ground water. This information is useful to predict the long-term persistence of source areas. Knowledge ofthe diffusive flux of volatile organic compounds from NAPLs or ground water to theatmosphere or other identified receptor for vapors is required to estimate exposure of the human population or ecological receptors to contaminant vapors. If the flux of vapors can be compared to the discharge of the contaminants in ground water, the contribution ofvolatilization to natural attenuation of contamination in ground water can be documented. Total Organic Carbon : Knowledge of the TOC content of the aquifer matrix is important for sorption and solute-retardation calculations. TOC samples should becollected from a background location in the stratigraphic horizon(s) where most contaminant transport is expected to occur. Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide : Oxygen and carbon dioxide soil gas measurements can be used to identify areas in the unsaturated zone where biodegradation is occurring. This can be a useful and relatively inexpensive way to identify NAPL source areas, particularly when solvents are codisposed with fuels or greases (AFCEE, 1994).38Fuel and Chlorinated Volatile Organic Compounds : Knowledge of the distribution of contaminants in soil gas can be used as a cost-effective way to estimate the extent of soil contamination. 2.3.2 Ground-water Characterization To adequately determine the amount and three-dimensional distribution of dissolved contamination and to document the occurrence of natural attenuation, ground-water samples mustbe collected and analyzed. Biodegradation of organic compounds, whether natural or anthropogenic,brings about measurable changes in the chemistry of ground water in the affected area. By measuringthese changes, it is possible to document and quantitatively evaluate the importance of naturalattenuation at a site. Ground-water sampling is conducted to determine the concentrations and distribution of contaminants, daughter products, and ground-water geochemical parameters. Ground-water samplesmay be obtained from monitoring wells or with point-source sampling devices such as a Geoprobe\u00ae,Hydropunch\u00ae , or cone penetrometer. All ground-water samples should be collected, handled, and disposed of in accordance with local, State, and Federal guidelines. Appendix A contains suggestedprocedures for ground-water sample collection. These procedures may need to be modified tocomply with local, State, and Federal regulations or to accommodate site-specific conditions. The analytical protocol for ground-water sample analysis is presented in Table 2.1. This analytical protocol includes all of the parameters necessary to delineate dissolved contaminationand to document natural attenuation, including the effects of sorption and biodegradation. Dataobtained from the analysis of ground water for these analytes is used to scientifically documentnatural attenuation and can be used as input into a solute fate and transport model. The followingparagraphs describe each ground-water analytical parameter and the use of each analyte in thenatural attenuation demonstration. 2.3.2.1 Volatile and Semivolatile Organic Compounds These analytes are used to determine the type, concentration, and distribution of contaminants and daughter products in the aquifer. In many cases, chlorinated solvents are found commingledwith fuels or other hydrocarbons. At a minimum, the volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis(Method SW8260A) should be used, with the addition of the trimethylbenzene isomers if fuelhydrocarbons are present or suspected. The combined dissolved concentrations of BTEX andtrimethylbenzenes should not be greater than about 30 mg/L for a JP-4 spill (Smith et al., 1981) or about 135 mg/L for a gasoline spill (Cline et al., 1991; American Petroleum Institute, 1985). If these compounds are found in higher concentrations, sampling errors such as emulsification ofLNAPL in the ground-water sample likely have occurred and should be investigated. Maximum concentrations of chlorinated solvents dissolved in ground water from neat solvents should not exceed their solubilities in water. Appendix B contains solubilities for commoncontaminants. If contaminants are found in concentrations greater than their solubilities, thensampling errors such as emulsification of NAPL in the ground-water sample have likely occurredand should be investigated. 2.3.2.2 Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen is the most thermodynamically favored electron acceptor used by microbes for the biodegradation of organic carbon, whether natural or anthropogenic. Anaerobic bacteriagenerally cannot function at dissolved oxygen concentrations greater than about 0.5 mg/L and,hence, reductive dechlorination will not occur. This is why it is important to have a source ofcarbon in the aquifer that can be used by aerobic microorganisms as a primary substrate. During39aerobic respiration, dissolved oxygen concentrations decrease. After depletion of dissolved oxygen, anaerobic microbes will use nitrate as an electron acceptor, followed by iron (III), then sulfate, andfinally carbon dioxide (methanogenesis). Each sequential reaction drives the ORP of the groundwater downward into the range within which reductive dechlorination can occur. Reductivedechlorination is most effective in the ORP range corresponding to sulfate reduction andmethanogenesis, but dechlorination of PCE and TCE also may occur in the ORP range associatedwith denitrification or iron (III) reduction. Dehalogenation of DCE and VC generally are restrictedto sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions. Dissolved oxygen measurements should be taken during well purging and immediately before and after sample acquisition using a direct-reading meter. Because most well purging techniquescan allow aeration of collected ground-water samples, it is important to minimize the potential foraeration as described in Appendix A. 2.3.2.3 Nitrate After dissolved oxygen has been depleted in the microbiological treatment zone, nitrate may be used as an electron acceptor for anaerobic biodegradation of organic carbon via denitrification.In order for reductive dechlorination to occur, nitrate concentrations in the contaminated portion ofthe aquifer must be less than 1.0 mg/L. 2.3.2.4 Iron (II) In some cases, iron (III) is used as an electron acceptor during anaerobic biodegradation of organic carbon. During this process, iron (III) is reduced to iron (II), which may be soluble in water.Iron (II) concentrations can thus be used as an indicator of anaerobic degradation of fuel compounds,and vinyl chloride (see Section 2.2.1.1.2). Native organic matter may also support reduction of iron(II). Care must be taken when interpreting iron (II) concentrations because they may be biased lowby reprecipitation as sulfides or carbonates. 2.3.2.5 Sulfate After dissolved oxygen and nitrate have been depleted in the microbiological treatment zone, sulfate may be used as an electron acceptor for anaerobic biodegradation. This process is termed\"sulfate reduction\" and results in the production of sulfide. Concentrations of sulfate greater than20 mg/L may cause competitive exclusion of dechlorination. However, in many plumes with highconcentrations of sulfate, reductive dechlorination still occurs. 2.3.2.6 Methane During methanogenesis acetate is split to form carbon dioxide and methane, or carbon dioxide is used as an electron acceptor, and is reduced to methane. Methanogenesis generally occurs afteroxygen, nitrate, and sulfate have been depleted in the treatment zone. The presence of methane inground water is indicative of strongly reducing conditions. Because methane is not present in fuel,the presence of methane above background concentrations in ground water in contact with fuels isindicative of microbial degradation of hydrocarbons. Methane also is associated with spills of purechlorinated solvents (Weaver et al., 1996). It is not known if the methane comes from chlorinated solvent carbon or from native dissolved organic carbon. 2.3.2.7 Alkalinity There is a positive correlation between zones of microbial activity and increased alkalinity. Increases in alkalinity result from the dissolution of rock driven by the production of carbon dioxideproduced by the metabolism of microorganisms. Alkalinity is important in the maintenance ofground-water pH because it buffers the ground water system against acids generated during both40aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. In the experience of the authors, biodegradation of organic compounds rarely, if ever, generates enough acid to impact the pH of the ground water. 2.3.2.8 Oxidation-Reduction Potential The ORP of ground water is a measure of electron activity and is an indicator of the relative tendency of a solution to accept or transfer electrons. Oxidation-reduction reactions in groundwater containing organic compounds (natural or anthropogenic) are usually biologically mediated,and, therefore, the ORP of a ground water system depends upon and influences rates ofbiodegradation. Knowledge of the ORP of ground water also is important because some biologicalprocesses operate only within a prescribed range of ORP conditions. ORP measurements can be used to provide real-time data on the location of the contaminant plume, especially in areas undergoing anaerobic biodegradation. Mapping the ORP of the groundwater while in the field helps the field scientist to determine the approximate location of thecontaminant plume. To map the ORP of the ground water while in the field, it is important to haveat least one ORP measurement (preferably more) from a well located upgradient from the plume.ORP measurements should be taken during well purging and immediately before and after sampleacquisition using a direct-reading meter. Because most well purging techniques can allow aerationof collected ground-water samples (which can affect ORP measurements), it is important to minimizepotential aeration by using a flow-through cell as outlined in Appendix A. Most discussion of oxidation reduction potential expresses the potential as if it were measured against the standard hydrogen electrode. Most electrodes and meters to measure oxidation-reductionpotential use the silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl) as the This protocoluses the potential against the Ag/AgCl electrode as the screening potential, not Eh as would bemeasured against the standard hydrogen electrode. 2.3.2.9 Dissolved Hydrogen In some ground waters, PCE and TCE appear to attenuate, although significant concentrations of DCE and VC do not accumulate. In this situation, it is difficult to distinguish between Type 3behavior where the daughter products are not produced, and Type 1 or Type 2 behavior where thedaughter products are removed very rapidly. In cases like this, the concentration of hydrogen canbe used to identify ground waters where reductive dechlorination is occurring. If hydrogenconcentrations are very low, reductive dechlorination is not efficient and Type 3 behavior is indicated.If hydrogen concentrations are greater than approximately 1 nM, rates of reductive dechlorinationshould have environmental significance and Type 1 or Type 2 behavior would be expected. Concentrations of dissolved hydrogen have been used to evaluate redox processes, and thus the efficiency of reductive dechlorination, in ground-water systems (Lovley and Goodwin, 1988;Lovley et al., 1994; Chapelle et al., 1995). Dissolved hydrogen is continuously produced in anoxic ground-water systems by fermentative microorganisms that decompose natural and anthropogenicorganic matter. This H 2 is then consumed by respiratory microorganisms that use nitrate, Fe(III), sulfate, or CO2 as terminal electron acceptors. This continuous cycling of H2 is called interspecies hydrogen transfer. Significantly, nitrate-, Fe(III)-, sulfate- and CO2-reducing (methanogenic) microorganisms exhibit different efficiencies in utilizing the H2 that is being continually produced. Nitrate reducers are highly efficient H2 utilizers and maintain very low steady-state H2 concentrations. Fe(III) reducers are slightly less efficient and thus maintain somewhat higher H2 concentrations. Sulfate reducers and methanogenic bacteria are progressively less efficient and maintain even higherH 2 concentrations. Because each terminal electron accepting process has a characteristic H2 concentration associated with it, H2 concentrations can be an indicator of predominant redox41processes. These characteristic ranges are given in Table 2.5. An analytical protocol for quantifying H2 concentrations in ground water is given in Appendix A. Table 2.5 Range of Hydrogen Concentrations for a Given Terminal Electron-Accepting Process Terminal Electron Hydrogen (H2) Accepting Process Concentration (nanomoles per liter) Denitrification < 0.1 Iron (III) Reduction 0.2 to 0.8 Sulfate Reduction 1 to 4 Reductive Dechlorination >1 Methanogenesis 5-20 Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) measurements are based on the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium and, within the constraints of that assumption, can be used to evaluate redox processesin ground water systems. The H 2 method is based on the ecological concept of interspecies hydrogen transfer by microorganisms and, within the constraints of that assumption, can also be used toevaluate redox processes. These methods, therefore, are fundamentally different. A direct comparisonof these methods (Chapelle et al., 1996) has shown that ORP measurements were effective indelineating oxic from anoxic ground water, but that ORP measurements could not distinguish betweennitrate-reducing, Fe(III)-reducing, sulfate-reducing, or methanogenic zones in an aquifer. In contrast,the H 2 method could readily distinguish between different anaerobic zones. For those sites where distinguishing between different anaerobic processes is important, H2 measurements are an available technology for making such distinctions. At sites where concentrations of redox sensitive parameterssuch as dissolved oxygen, iron (II), sulfide, and methane are sufficient to identify operative redoxprocesses, H 2 concentrations are not always required to identify redox zonation and predict contaminant behavior. In practice, it is preferable to interpret H2 concentrations in the context of electron acceptor availability and the presence of the final products of microbial metabolism (Chapelle et al., 1995). For example, if sulfate concentrations in ground water are less than 0.5 mg/L, methane concentrationsare greater than 0.5 mg/L, and H 2 concentrations are in the 5 to 20 nM range, it can be concluded with a high degree of certainty that methanogenesis is the predominant redox process in the aquifer.Similar logic can be applied to identifying denitrification (presence of nitrate, H 2<0.1 nM), Fe(III) reduction (production of Fe(II), H2 concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 nM), and sulfate reduction (presence of sulfate, production of sulfide, H2 concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 nM). Reductive dechlorination in the field has been documented at hydrogen concentrations that support sulfatereduction or methanogenesis. If hydrogen concentrations are high enough to support sulfate reductionor methanogenesis, then reductive dechlorination is probably occurring, even if other geochemicalindicators as scored in Table 2.3 do not indicate that reductive dechlorination is possible. 2.3.2.10 pH, Temperature, and Conductivity Because the pH, temperature, and conductivity of a ground-water sample can change significantly within a short time following sample acquisition, these parameters must be measuredin the field in unfiltered, unpreserved, \"fresh\" water collected by the same technique as the samplestaken for dissolved oxygen and ORP analyses. The measurements should be made in a clean42container separate from those intended for laboratory analysis, and the measured values should be recorded in the ground-water sampling record. The pH of ground water has an effect on the presence and activity of microbial populations in ground water. This is especially true for methanogens. Microbes capable of degrading chlorinatedaliphatic hydrocarbons and petroleum hydrocarbon compounds generally prefer pH values varyingfrom 6 to 8 standard units. Ground-water temperature directly affects the solubility of dissolved gasses and other geochemical species. Ground-water temperature also affects the metabolic activity of bacteria. Conductivity is a measure of the ability of a solution to conduct electricity. The conductivity of ground water is directly related to the concentration of ions in solution; conductivity increases asion concentration increases. 2.3.2.11 Chloride Chlorine is the most abundant of the halogens. Although chlorine can occur in oxidation states ranging from Cl - to Cl+7, the chloride form (Cl-) is the only form of major significance in natural waters (Hem, 1985). Chloride forms ion pairs or complex ions with some of the cationspresent in natural waters, but these complexes are not strong enough to be of significance in thechemistry of fresh water (Hem, 1985). Chloride ions generally do not enter into oxidation-reductionreactions, form no important solute complexes with other ions unless the chloride concentration isextremely high, do not form salts of low solubility, are not significantly adsorbed on mineral surfaces,and play few vital biochemical roles (Hem, 1985). Thus, physical processes control the migrationof chloride ions in the subsurface. Kaufman and Orlob (1956) conducted tracer experiments inground water, and found that chloride moved through most of the soils tested more conservatively(i.e., with less retardation and loss) than any of the other tracers tested. During biodegradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons dissolved in ground water, chloride is released into the ground water. This results in chloride concentrations in ground water in thecontaminant plume that are elevated relative to background concentrations. Because of the neutralchemical behavior of chloride, it can be used as a conservative tracer to estimate biodegradationrates, as discussed in Appendix C. 2.3.3 Aquifer Parameter Estimation Estimates of aquifer parameters are necessary to accurately evaluate contaminant fate and transport. 2.3.3.1 Hydraulic Conductivity Hydraulic conductivity is a measure of an aquifer's ability to transmit water, and is perhaps the most important aquifer parameter governing fluid flow in the subsurface. The velocity of groundwater and dissolved contamination is directly related to the hydraulic conductivity of the saturatedzone. In addition, subsurface variations in hydraulic conductivity directly influence contaminantfate and transport by providing preferential paths for contaminant migration. Estimates of hydraulicconductivity are used to determine residence times for contaminants and tracers, and to determinethe seepage velocity of ground water. The most common methods used to quantify hydraulic conductivity are aquifer pumping tests and slug tests (Appendix A). Another method that may be used to determine hydraulic conductivityis the borehole dilution test. One drawback to these methods is that they average hydraulic propertiesover the screened interval. To help alleviate this potential problem, the screened interval of the testwells should be selected after consideration is given to subsurface stratigraphy.43Information about subsurface stratigraphy should come from geologic logs of continuous cores or from cone penetrometer tests. The rate of filling of a Hydropunch can be used to obtain a rough estimate of the local hydraulic conductivity at the same time the water sample is collected.The results of pressure dissipation data from cone penetrometer tests can be used to supplement theresults obtained from pumping tests and slug tests. It is important that the location of the aquifertests be designed to collect information to delineate the range of hydraulic conductivity both verticallyand horizontally at the site. 2.3.3.1.1 Pumping Tests in Wells Pumping tests done in wells provide information on the average hydraulic conductivity of the screened interval, but not the most transmissive horizon included in the screened interval. Incontaminated areas, the extracted ground water generally must be collected and treated, increasingthe difficulty of such testing. In addition, a minimum 4-inch-diameter well is typically required tocomplete pumping tests in highly transmissive aquifers because the 2-inch submersible pumpsavailable today are not capable of producing a flow rate high enough for meaningful pumping tests.In areas with fairly uniform aquifer materials, pumping tests can be completed in uncontaminatedareas, and the results can be used to estimate hydraulic conductivity in the contaminated area.Pumping tests should be conducted in wells that are screened in the most transmissive zones in theaquifer. If pumping tests are conducted in wells with more than fifteen feet of screen, a down-holeflowmeter test can be used to determine the interval actually contributing to flow. 2.3.3.1.2 Slug Tests in Wells Slug tests are a commonly used alternative to pumping tests. One commonly cited drawback to slug testing is that this method generally gives hydraulic conductivity information only for the areaimmediately surrounding the monitoring well. Slug tests do, however, have two distinct advantagesover pumping tests: they can be conducted in 2-inch monitoring wells, and they produce no water.If slug tests are going to be relied upon to provide information on the three-dimensional distributionof hydraulic conductivity in an aquifer, multiple slug tests must be performed. It is not advisable torely on data from one slug test in one monitoring well. Because of this, slug tests should beconducted at several zones across the site, including a test in at least two wells which are narrowlyscreened in the most transmissive zone. There should also be tests in the less transmissive zones toprovide an estimate of the range of values present on the site. 2.3.3.1.3 Downhole Flowmeter Borehole flowmeter tests are conducted to investigate the relative vertical distribution of horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the screened interval of a well or the uncased portion of aborehole. These tests can be done to identify any preferential flow pathways within the portion ofan aquifer intersecting the test well screen or the open borehole. The work of Molz and Young(1993), Molz et al. (1994) , Young and Pearson (1995), and Young (1995) describes the means by which these tests may be conducted and interpreted. In general, measurements of ambient ground-water flow rates are collected at several regularly spaced locations along the screened interval of a well. Next, the well is pumped at a steady rate,and the measurements are repeated. The test data may be analyzed using the methods described byMolz and Young (1993) and Molz et al. (1994) to define the relative distribution of horizontal hydraulic conductivity within the screened interval of the test well. Estimates of bulk hydraulicconductivity from previous aquifer tests can be used to estimate the absolute hydraulic conductivitydistribution at the test well.44Using flowmeter test data, one may be able to more thoroughly quantify the three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity distribution at a site. This is important for defining contaminant migrationpathways and understanding solute transport at sites with heterogeneous aquifers. Even at siteswhere the hydrogeology appears relatively homogeneous, such data may point out previouslyundetected zones or layers of higher hydraulic conductivity that control contaminant migration. Inaddition, ground-water velocities calculated from hydraulic head, porosity, and hydraulic conductivitydata may be used to evaluate site data or for simple transport calculations. In these cases, it is alsoimportant to have the best estimate possible of hydraulic conductivity for those units in which thecontaminants are migrating. 2.3.3.2 Hydraulic Gradient The horizontal hydraulic gradient is the change in hydraulic head (feet of water) divided by the distance of ground-water flow between head measurement points. To accurately determine thehydraulic gradient, it is necessary to measure ground-water levels in all monitoring wells andpiezometers at a site. Because hydraulic gradients can change over a short distance within anaquifer, it is essential to have as much site-specific ground-water elevation information as possibleso that accurate hydraulic gradient calculations can be made. In addition, seasonal variations inground-water flow direction can have a profound influence on contaminant transport. Sites inupland areas are less likely to be affected by seasonal variations in ground-water flow direction thanlow-elevation sites situated near surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes. To determine the effect of seasonal variations in ground-water flow direction on contaminant transport, quarterly ground-water level measurements should be taken over a period of at least oneyear. For many sites, these data may already exist. If hydraulic gradient data over a one-year periodare not available, natural attenuation can still be implemented, pending an analysis of seasonalvariation in ground-water flow direction. 2.3.3.3 Processes Causing an Apparent Reduction in Total Contaminant Mass Several processes cause reductions in contaminant concentrations and apparent reductions in the total mass of contaminant in a system. Processes causing apparent reductions in contaminantmass include dilution, sorption, and hydrodynamic dispersion. In order to determine the mass ofcontaminant removed from the system, it is necessary to correct observed concentrations for theeffects of these processes. This is done by incorporating independent assessments of these processesinto the comprehensive solute transport model. The following sections give a brief overview of theprocesses that result in apparent contaminant reduction. Appendix B describes these processes indetail. Dilution results in a reduction in contaminant concentrations and an apparent reduction in the total mass of contaminant in a system due to the introduction of additional water to the system. Thetwo most common causes of dilution (real or apparent) are infiltration and sampling from monitoringwells screened over large vertical intervals. Infiltration can cause an apparent reduction incontaminant mass by mixing unaffected waters with the contaminant plume, thereby causing dilution.Monitoring wells screened over large vertical distances may dilute ground-water samples by mixingwater from clean aquifer zones with contaminated water during sampling. To avoid potential dilutionduring sampling, monitoring wells should be screened over relatively small vertical intervals (e.g.5 feet). Nested wells should be used to define the vertical extent of contamination in the saturatedzone. Appendix C contains example calculations showing how to correct for the effects of dilution.45The retardation of organic solutes caused by sorption is an important consideration when simulating the effects of natural attenuation over time. Sorption of a contaminant to the aquifermatrix results in an apparent decrease in contaminant mass because dissolved contamination isremoved from the aqueous phase. The processes of contaminant sorption and retardation arediscussed in Appendix B. The dispersion of organic solutes in an aquifer is another important consideration when simulating natural attenuation. The dispersion of a contaminant into relatively pristine portions ofthe aquifer allows the solute plume to mix with uncontaminated ground water containing higherconcentrations of electron acceptors. Dispersion occurs vertically as well as parallel and perpendicularto the direction of ground-water flow. To accurately determine the mass of contaminant transformed to innocuous by-products, it is important to correct measured contaminant concentrations for those processes that cause an apparentreduction in contaminant mass. This is accomplished by normalizing the measured concentrationof each of the contaminants to the concentration of a tracer that is biologically recalcitrant. Becausechloride is produced during the biodegradation of chlorinated solvents, this analyte can be used asa tracer. For chlorinated solvents undergoing reductive dechlorination, it is also possible to use theorganic carbon in the original chlorinated solvent and daughter products as a tracer. Trimethylbenzeneand tetramethylbenzene are two chemicals found in fuel hydrocarbon plumes that also may beuseful as tracers. These compounds are difficult to biologically degrade under anaerobic conditions,and frequently persist in ground water longer than BTEX. Depending on the composition of thefuel that was released, other tracers may be used. 2.3.4 Optional Confirmation of Biological Activity Extensive evidence can be found in the literature showing that biodegradation of chlorinated solvents and fuel hydrocarbons frequently occurs under natural conditions. Many references fromthe large body of literature in support of natural attenuation are listed in Section 3 and discussed inAppendix B. The most common technique used to show explicitly that microorganisms capable ofdegrading contaminants are present at a site is the microcosm study. If additional evidence (beyond contaminant and geochemical data and supporting calculations) supporting natural attenuation is required, a microcosm study using site-specific aquifer materialsand contaminants can be undertaken. If properly designed, implemented, and interpreted, microcosm studies can provide very convincing documentation of the occurrence of biodegradation. Results of such studies are stronglyinfluenced by the nature of the geological material submitted for study, the physical properties ofthe microcosm, the sampling strategy, and the duration of the study. Because microcosm studiesare time-consuming and expensive, they should be undertaken only at sites where there is considerableuncertainty concerning the biodegradation of contaminants. Biodegradation rate constants determined by microcosm studies often are higher than rates achieved in the field. The collection of material for the microcosm study, the procedures used to setup and analyze the microcosm, and the interpretation of the results of the microcosm study arepresented in Appendix C. 2.4 REFINE CONCEPTUAL MODEL, COMPLETE PRE-MODELING CALCULA- TIONS, AND DOCUMENT INDICATORS OF NATURAL ATTENUATION Site investigation data should first be used to refine the conceptual model and quantify ground- water flow, sorption, dilution, and biodegradation. The results of these calculations are used toscientifically document the occurrence and rates of natural attenuation and to help simulate natural46attenuation over time. It is the responsibility of the proponent to \"make the case\" for natural attenuation. This being the case, all available data must be integrated in such a way that the evidenceis sufficient to support the conclusion that natural attenuation is occurring. 2.4.1 Conceptual Model Refinement Conceptual model refinement involves integrating newly gathered site characterization data to refine the preliminary conceptual model that was developed on the basis of previously collectedsite-specific data. During conceptual model refinement, all available site-specific data should beintegrated to develop an accurate three-dimensional representation of the hydrogeologic andcontaminant transport system. This refined conceptual model can then be used for contaminantfate and transport modeling. Conceptual model refinement consists of several steps, includingpreparation of geologic logs, hydrogeologic sections, potentiometric surface/water table Geologic Logs Geologic logs of all subsurface materials encountered during the soil boring phase of the field work should be constructed. Descriptions of the aquifer matrix should include relative density,color, major and minor minerals, porosity, relative moisture content, plasticity of fines, cohesiveness,grain size, structure or stratification, relative permeability, and any other significant observationssuch as visible contaminants or contaminant odor. It is also important to correlate the results ofVOC screening using soil sample headspace vapor analysis with depth intervals of geologic materials.The depth of lithologic contacts and/or significant textural changes should be recorded to the nearest0.1 foot. This resolution is necessary because preferential flow and contaminant transport pathsmay be limited to thin stratigraphic units. 2.4.1.2 Cone Penetrometer Logs Cone Penetrometer Logs provide a valuable tool for the rapid collection of large amounts of stratigraphic information. When combined with the necessary corroborative physical soil samplesfrom each stratigraphic unit occurring on the site, they can provide a three-dimensional model ofsubsurface stratigraphy. Cone penetrometer logs express stratigraphic information as the ratio of sleeve friction to tip pressure. Cone penetrometer logs also may contain fluid resistivity data and estimates of aquiferhydraulic conductivity. To provide meaningful data, the cone penetrometer must be capable ofproviding stratigraphic resolution on the order of 3 inches. To provide accurate stratigraphicinformation, cone penetrometer logs must be correlated with continuous subsurface cores. At aminimum, there must be one correlation for every hydrostratigraphic unit found at the site. Conepenetrometer logs, along with geologic boring logs, can be used to complete the hydrogeologicsections discussed in Section 2.4.1.3. 2.4.1.3 Hydrogeologic Sections Hydrogeologic sections should be prepared from boring logs and/or CPT data. A minimum of two hydrogeologic sections are required; one parallel to the direction of ground-water flow and oneperpendicular to the direction of ground water flow. More complex sites may require morehydrogeologic sections. Hydraulic head data including potentiometric surface and/or water tableelevation data should be plotted on the hydrogeologic section. These sections are useful in identifyingpotential pathways of contaminant migration, including preferential pathways of NAPL migration(e.g., surface topography and dip of confining layers) and of aqueous contaminants (e.g., highly47transmissive layers). The potential distribution NAPL sources as well as preferential pathways for solute transport should be considered when simulating contaminant transport using fate and transportmodels. 2.4.1.4 Potentiometric Surface or Water Table Map(s) A potentiometric surface or water table map is a two-dimensional graphic representation of equipotential lines shown in plan view. These maps should be prepared from water levelmeasurements and surveyor's data. Because ground water flows from areas of higher hydraulichead to areas of lower hydraulic head, such maps are used to estimate the probable direction ofplume migration and to calculate hydraulic gradients. These maps should be prepared using waterlevels measured in wells screened in the same relative position within the same hydrogeologic unit.To determine vertical hydraulic gradients, separate potentiometric maps should be developed fordifferent horizons in the aquifer to document vertical variations in ground-water flow. Flow netsshould also be constructed to document vertical variations in ground-water flow. To documentseasonal variations in ground-water flow, separate potentiometric surface or water table mapsshould be prepared for quarterly water level measurements taken over a period of at least one year.In areas with mobile LNAPL, a correction must be made for the water table deflection caused byaccumlation of the LNAPL in the well. This correction and potentiometric surface map preparationare discussed in Appendix C. 2.4.1.5 Contaminant and Daughter Product Contour Maps Contaminant and daughter product contour maps should be prepared for all contaminants present at the site for each discrete sampling event. Such maps allow interpretation of data on thedistribution and the relative transport and degradation rates of contaminants in the subsurface. Inaddition, contaminant contour maps are necessary so that contaminant concentrations can be griddedand used for input into a numerical model. Detection of daughter products not present in thereleased NAPL (e.g., cis-1,2-DCE, VC, or Preparation of contaminant isopleth maps is discussed in Appendix C. If mobile and residual NAPLs are present at the site, a contour map showing the thickness and vertical and horizontal distribution of each should be prepared. These maps will allow interpretationof the distribution and the relative transport rate of NAPLs in the subsurface. In addition, thesemaps will aid in partitioning calculations and solute fate and transport model development. It isimportant to note that, because of the differences between the magnitude of capillary suction in theaquifer matrix and the different surface tension properties of NAPL and water, NAPL thicknessobservations made at monitoring points may not provide an accurate estimate of the actual volumeof mobile and residual NAPL in the aquifer. To accurately determine the distribution of NAPLs, itis necessary to take continuous soil cores or, if confident that chlorinated solvents present as NAPLare commingled with fuels, to use cone penetrometer testing coupled with laser-induced fluorescence.Appendix C discusses the relationship between actual and apparent thickness. 2.4.1.6 Electron Acceptor, Metabolic By-product, and Alkalinity Contour maps should be prepared for electron acceptors consumed (dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate) and metabolic by-products produced [iron (II), chloride, and methane] duringbiodegradation. In addition, a contour map should be prepared for alkalinity and ORP. The electronacceptor, metabolic by-product, alkalinity, and ORP contour maps provide evidence of the occurrenceof biodegradation at a site. If hydrogen data are available, they also should be contoured.48During aerobic biodegradation, dissolved oxygen concentrations will decrease to levels below background concentrations. Similarly, during anaerobic degradation, the concentrations of nitrateand sulfate will be seen to decrease to levels below background. The electron acceptor contourmaps allow interpretation of data on the distribution of the electron acceptors and the relative transportand degradation rates of contaminants in the subsurface. Thus, electron acceptor contour mapsprovide visual evidence of biodegradation and a visual indication of the relationship between thecontaminant plume and the various electron acceptors. Contour maps should be prepared for iron (II), chloride, and methane. During anaerobic degradation, the concentrations of these parameters will be seen to increase to levels abovebackground. These maps allow interpretation of data on the distribution of metabolic by-productsresulting from the microbial degradation of fuel hydrocarbons and the relative transport anddegradation rates of contaminants in the subsurface. Thus, metabolic by-product contour mapsprovide visual evidence of biodegradation and a visual indication of the relationship between thecontaminant plume and the various metabolic by-products. A contour map should be prepared for total alkalinity (as CaCO 3). Respiration of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), and sulfate tends to increase the total alkalinity of ground water. Thus,the total alkalinity inside the contaminant plume generally increases to levels above background.This map will allow visual interpretation of alkalinity data by showing the relationship between thecontaminant plume and elevated alkalinity. 2.4.2 Pre-Modeling Calculations Several calculations must be made prior to implementation of the solute fate and transport model. These calculations include sorption and retardation calculations, NAPL/water partitioningcalculations, ground-water flow velocity calculations, and biodegradation rate-constant calculations.Each of these calculations is discussed in the following sections. The specifics of each calculationare presented in the appendices referenced below. 2.4.2.1 Analysis of Daughter Product, Electron Acceptor, Metabolic By-product, and Total Alkalinity Data The extent and distribution (vertical and horizontal) of contamination, daughter product, and electron acceptor and metabolic by-product concentrations are of paramount importance indocumenting the occurrence of biodegradation and in solute fate and transport model implementation. Comparison of contaminant, electron acceptor, electron donor, and metabolic by-product distributions can help identify significant trends in site biodegradation. Dissolved oxygenconcentrations below background in an area with organic contamination are indicative of aerobicbiodegradation of organic carbon. Similarly, nitrate and sulfate concentrations below backgroundin an area with contamination are indicative of anaerobic biodegradation of organic carbon. Likewise,elevated concentrations of the metabolic by-products iron (II), chloride, and methane in areas withcontamination are indicative of biodegradation of organic carbon. In addition, elevated concentrationsof total alkalinity (as CaCO 3) in areas with contamination are indicative of biodegradation of organic compounds via aerobic respiration, denitrification, iron (III) reduction, and sulfate reduction. Ifthese trends can be documented, it is possible to quantify the relative importance of eachbiodegradation mechanism, as described in Appendices B and C. The contour maps described inSection 2.4.1 can be used to provide graphical evidence of these relationships. Detection of daughter products not present in the released NAPL (e.g., cis-1,2-DCE, VC, or ethene) provides evidence of reductive dechlorination. The contour maps described in Section 2.4.1in conjunction with NAPL analyses can be used to show that reductive dechlorination is occurring.492.4.2.2 Sorption and Retardation Calculations Contaminant sorption and retardation calculations should be made based on the TOC content of the aquifer matrix and the organic carbon partitioning coefficient (Koc) for each contaminant.The average TOC concentration from the most transmissive zone in the aquifer should be used forretardation calculations. A sensitivity analysis should also be performed during modeling using arange of TOC concentrations, including the lowest TOC concentration measured at the site. Sorptionand retardation calculations should be completed for all contaminants and any tracers. Sorptionand retardation calculations are described in Appendix C. 2.4.2.3 NAPL/Water Partitioning Calculations If NAPL remains at the site, partitioning calculations should be made to account for the partitioning from this phase into ground water. Several models for NAPL/water partitioning havebeen proposed in recent years, including those by Hunt et al. (1988), Bruce et al. (1991), Cline et al. (1991), and Johnson and Pankow (1992). Because the models presented by Cline et al. (1991) and Bruce et al. (1991) represent equilibrium partitioning, they are the most conservative models. Equilibrium partitioning is conservative because it predicts the maximum dissolved concentrationwhen NAPL in contact with water is allowed to reach equilibrium. The results of these equilibriumpartitioning calculations can be used in a solute fate and transport model to simulate a continuingsource of contamination. The theory behind fuel/water partitioning calculations is presented inAppendix B, and example calculations are presented in Appendix C. 2.4.2.4 Ground-water Flow Velocity Calculations The average linear ground-water flow velocity of the most transmissive aquifer zone containing contamination should be calculated to check the accuracy of the solute fate and transport model andto allow calculation of first-order biodegradation rate constants. An example of a ground-waterflow velocity calculation is given in Appendix C. 2.4.2.5 Apparent Biodegradation Rate-Constant Calculations Biodegradation rate constants are necessary to accurately simulate the fate and transport of contaminants dissolved in ground water. In many cases, biodegradation of contaminants can beapproximated using first-order kinetics. In order to calculate first-order biodegradation rate constants,the apparent degradation rate must be normalized for the effects of dilution, sorption, andvolatilization. Two methods for determining first-order rate constants are described in Appendix C.One method involves the use of a biologically recalcitrant compound found in the dissolvedcontaminant plume that can be used as a conservative tracer. The other method, proposed by Buscheckand Alcantar (1995) is based on the one-dimensional steady-state analytical solution to the advection-dispersion equation presented by Bear (1979). It is appropriate for plumes where contaminantconcentrations are in dynamic equilibrium between plume formation at the source and plumeattenuation downgradient. Because of the complexity of estimating biodegradation rates with thesemethods, the results are more accurately referred to as \"apparent\" biodegradation rate constants.Apparent degradation rates reflect the difference between contaminant degradation and productionwhich is important for some daughter products (e.g., TCE, DCE, and VC). 2.5 SIMULATE NATURAL ATTENUATION USING SOLUTE FATE AND TRANS- PORT MODELS Simulating natural attenuation allows prediction of the migration and attenuation of the contaminant plume through time. Natural attenuation modeling is a tool that allows site-specificdata to be used to predict the fate and transport of solutes under governing physical, chemical, and50biological processes. Hence, the results of the modeling effort are not in themselves sufficient proof that natural attenuation is occurring at a given site. The results of the modeling effort are onlyas good as the original data input into the model; therefore, an investment in thorough sitecharacterization will improve the validity of the modeling results. In some cases, straightforwardanalytical models of solute transport are adequate to simulate natural attenuation. Several well-documented and widely accepted solute fate and transport models are available for simulating the fate and transport of contaminants under the influence of advection, dispersion,sorption, and biodegradation. 2.6 CONDUCT A RECEPTOR EXPOSURE PATHWAYS ANALYSIS After the rates of natural attenuation have been documented, and predictions from appropriate fate and transport models indicate that MNA is a viable remedy, the proponent of natural attenuationshould combine all available data and information to provide support for this remedial option.Supporting the natural attenuation option generally will involve performing a receptor exposurepathways analysis. This analysis includes identifying potential human and ecological receptors andpoints of exposure under current and future land and ground-water use scenarios. The results ofsolute fate and transport modeling are central to the exposure pathways analysis. If conservativemodel input parameters are used, the solute fate and transport model should give conservativeestimates of contaminant plume migration. From this information, the potential for impacts onhuman health and the environment from contamination present at the site can be assessed. 2.7 EVALUATE SUPPLEMENTAL SOURCE REMOVAL OPTIONS Additional source removal, treatment, or containment measures, beyond those previously implemented, may be necessary for MNA to be a viable remedial option or to decrease the timeneeded for natural processes to attain site-specific remedial objectives. Several technologies suitablefor source reduction or removal are listed on Figure 2.1. Other technologies may be used as dictatedby site conditions and regulatory requirements. If a solute fate and transport model has been preparedfor a site, the impact of source removal can readily be evaluated by modifying the contaminantsource term; this will allow for a reevaluation of the exposure pathways analysis. In some cases (particularly if the site is regulated under CERCLA), the removal, treatment, or containment of the source may be required to restore the aquifer as a source of drinking water, or toprevent discharge of contaminants to ecologically sensitive areas. If a solute fate and transportmodel has been prepared, it can also be used to forecast the benefits of source control by predictingthe time required to restore the aquifer to drinking water quality, and the reduction in contaminantloadings to sensitive ecosystems. 2.8 PREPARE LONG-TERM MONITORING PLAN This plan is used to monitor the plume over time and to verify that natural attenuation is occurring at rates sufficient to attain site-specific remediation objectives and within the time framepredicted at the time of remedy selection. In addition, the long-term monitoring plan should bedesigned to evaluate long-term behavior of the plume, verify that exposure to contaminants doesnot occur, verify that natural attenuation breakdown products do not pose additional risks, determineactual (rather than predicted) attenuation rates for refining predictions of remediation time frame,and to document when site-specific remediation objectives have been attained.51The long-term monitoring plan should be developed based on site characterization data, analysis of potential exposure pathways, and the results of solute fate and transport modeling. EPA isdeveloping additional guidance on long-term monitoring of MNA remedies, which should beconsulted when available. The long-term monitoring plan includes two types of monitoring wells. Long-term monitoring wells are intended to determine if the behavior of the plume is changing. Performance evaluationwells are intended to confirm that contaminant concentrations meet regulatory acceptance levels,and to trigger an action to manage potential expansion of the plume. Figure 2.7 depicts a schematicthat describes the various categories of wells in a comprehensive monitoring plan. Figure 2.7 isintended to depict categories of wells, and does not depict monitoring well placement at a real site.Included in the schematic representation are: 1) wells in the source area; 2) wells in unimpactedground water; 3) wells downgradient of the source area in a zone of natural attenuation; 4) wellslocated downgradient from the plume where contaminant concentrations are below regulatoryacceptance levels but geochemical indicators are altered and soluble electron acceptors are depletedwith respect to unimpacted ground water; and 5) performance evaluation wells. The final number and placement of long-term monitoring wells and performance evaluation wells will vary from site to site, based on the behavior of the plume as revealed during the sitecharacterization and on the site-specific remediation objectives. In order to provide a valid monitoringsystem, all monitoring wells must be screened in the same hydrogeologic unit as the contaminantplume being monitored. This generally requires detailed stratigraphic correlation. To facilitateaccurate stratigraphic correlation, detailed visual descriptions of all subsurface materials encounteredduring borehole drilling or cone penetrometer testing should be prepared prior to monitoring wellinstallation. Figure 2.7 Hypothetical long-term monitoring strategy. Note that number and location of monitoring wells will vary with the three-dimensional complexity of the plume(s) and site-specificremediation objectives.52Although the final number and placement of long-term monitoring wells and performance evaluation wells should be determined through regulatory negotiation, the locations of long-termmonitoring wells should be based on the behavior of the plume as revealed during the sitecharacterization and on regulatory considerations. The final number and location of performanceevaluation wells will also depend on regulatory considerations. A ground-water sampling and analysis plan should be prepared in conjunction with a plan for placement of performance evaluation wells and long-term monitoring wells. For purposes ofmonitoring natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents, ground water from the long-term monitoringwells should be analyzed for the contaminants of concern, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, iron (II), sulfate,and methane. For performance evaluation wells, ground-water analyses should be limited tocontaminants of concern. Any additional specific analytical requirements, such as sampling forcontaminants that are metals, should be addressed in the sampling and analysis plan to ensure thatall data required for regulatory decision making are collected. Water level and NAPL thicknessmeasurements should be made during each sampling event. Except at sites with very low hydraulic conductivity and gradients, quarterly sampling of both long-term monitoring wells and performance evaluation wells is recommended during the first yearto help determine whether the plume is stable or migrating, the direction of plume migration and toestablish a baseline for behavior of the plume. After the first year, an appropriate sampling frequencyshould be established which considers seasonal variations in water table elevations, ground-waterflow direction and flow velocity at the site. If the hydraulic conductivity or hydraulic gradient arelow, the time required for ground water to move from upgradient monitoring wells to downgradientmonitoring wells should also be considered in determining the appropriate monitoring frequency.Monitoring of long-term performance of an MNA remedy should continue as long as contaminationremains above required cleanup levels. 2.9 PRESENT FINDINGS Results of natural attenuation studies should be presented in the remedy selection document appropriate for the site, such as CERCLA Feasibility Study or RCRA Corrective Measures Study.This will provide scientific documentation that allows an objective evaluation of whether MNA isthe most appropriate remedial option for a given site. All available site-specific data and information developed during the site characterization, conceptual model development, pre-modeling calculations, biodegradation rate calculation, ground-water modeling, model documentation, and long-term monitoring plan preparation phases of thenatural attenuation investigation should be presented in a consistent and complementary manner inthe feasibility study or similar document. Of particular interest to the site decision makers will beevidence that natural attenuation is occurring at rates sufficient to attain site-specific remediationobjectives in a time period that is reasonable compared to other alternatives, and that human healthand the environment will be protected over time. Since a weight-of-evidence argument will bepresented to support an MNA remedy, all model assuptions should be conservative and all availableevidence in support of MNA should be presented.53SECTION 3 REFERENCES Abdul, A.S., Kia, S.F., and Gibson, T.L., 1989, Limitations of monitoring wells for the detec- tion and quantification of petroleum products in soils and aquifers: Ground Water Monit.Rev., Spring, 1989, Pinder, G.F., 1985a, A multiphase approach to the modeling of porous media contamination by organic compounds: 1.

A4-19A1-4SECTION A-1 INTRODUCTION Detailed site characterization is an important aspect of the remediation by monitored natural attenuation. Typically, it is necessary to collect additional site-specific data in order to successfullycomplete the demonstration. This appendix presents an overview of field techniques that can beused to collect the data used to evaluate monitored natural attenuation. These techniques are mostappropriate for aquifers in unconsolidated sediments. They are less appropriate for fractured rock,and karst hydrogeologic settings. Selection of locations for field investigation activities and analyti-cal protocols used for soil and water samples are discussed in Section 2 of the protocol document. During all field investigation activities, special care should be taken to prevent contamination of the sampled matrices. The primary way that sample contamination can occur is through contact withimproperly cleaned equipment. To prevent such contamination, proper equipment decontaminationprocedures must be developed and followed. Procedures will vary according to site contaminants,equipment type, field activity, sample matrix, rinseate handling requirements, and regulatory require-ments. All equipment requires decontamination prior to initiation of site activities and betweensampling locations. New, disposable equipment does not require decontamination if factory-sealedand found acceptable according to the appropriate data quality objectives and the site specific Qual-ity Assurance Plan. In addition to the use of properly cleaned equipment, new, clean, disposablegloves (of a material appropriate to the activity and contaminant type/concentration) should be wornat each new sampling location. Basic health and safety precautions are required for every piece of equipment and every meth- odology discussed in this section. It is the responsibility of the investigator to be aware of and tocommunicate all health and safety issues to the field team; therefore, a site specific health and safetyplan must be developed prior to initiating investigation activities. At a minimum this plan mustcontain: A safety and health risk analysis for chemical, physical, and biological hazards associated with the site conditions, anticipated contaminants, equipment, field activities, and climate; An emergency response plan with applicable emergency response numbers; and Precautionary measures to be implemented to insure the safety of site workers. This appendix consists of seven sections, including this introduction. Section A-2 discusses subsurface investigation methodologies. Section A-3 discusses soil characterization methodologies.Section A-4 discusses groundwater characterization methodologies. Section A-5 discusses surfacewater and sediment characterization methodologies. Section A-6 discusses sample handling proce-dures. Section A-7 discusses aquifer characterization methodologies.A2-5SECTION A-2 SUBSURFACE INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGIES The ideal technologies for an investigation of monitored natural attenuation are those which can rapidly provide a large amount of information in a very short period of time while producing lowquantities of waste. The following subsections briefly introduce several alternatives that are avail-able for performing subsurface investigations to evaluate remediation by monitored natural attenua-tion. Although some of these alternatives more closely achieve the objectives of remediation bymonitored natural attenuation investigation than others, considerations such as site geology, sitehydrogeology, future well use, or regulatory concerns may dictate the selection of the subsurfaceinvestigation method for any given site. It is crucial to the evaluation of monitored natural attenua-tion to consider all of these issues prior to selecting a technology appropriate for their site. If duringthe investigation it becomes necessary to change methodologies, the same concerns must be re-addressed. Prior to initiating any intrusive subsurface activities, proposed drilling locations must be cleared. It is particularly useful if all utility lines in the investigation area are marked should changesto the investigation become necessary. In addition, in order to expedite the investigation, all neces-sary digging, coring, drilling, and ground-water monitoring point installation permits should beobtained prior to mobilizing to the field. Care should be taken not to cross-contaminate deeperaquifers by drilling through an aquitard underlying a DNAPL. At the conclusion of subsurface investigations, each sampling location that is not used to install a ground-water monitoring point or well should be restored as closely to its original condition aspossible. Where possible, holes should be sealed with bentonite chips, pellets, or grout to eliminateany creation or enhancement of contaminant migration pathways to the ground water. A.2.1 TRADITIONAL DRILLING TECHNIQUES Traditional drilling techniques include those methods that traditionally have been used to install drinking water supply wells. Examples of traditional drilling techniques include hollow stem auger,rotary, air percussion, and cable tool or chain tool. They have in common the advantage of beingcapable of installing wells of varying diameters to drinking water well specifications. Each of thesetechniques also allows for visual description of the materials and can allow for easy stratigraphiccorrelation. In general, the equipment required by each of these techniques is readily available.Disadvantages of traditional drilling techniques include their expense, time requirements, and wastegeneration. Not only do these techniques produce soil/fluids from the drilling process, frequently, inorder to properly develop wells by these techniques, a large volume of ground water must be ex-tracted during a lengthy development. Although the advantages and disadvantages listed above arecommon to most traditional drilling techniques, they are applicable to varying degrees. Furthermore,drilling depth and subsurface stratigraphy are important considerations when evaluating the efficacyof each of these techniques. Hollow-stem auger has been the most widely used traditional drilling technique in environmen- tal investigations, because it is very effective in the most commonly investigated geologic settingencountered during environmental investigations: unconsolidated deposits at shallow depths. Al-though less common, a chain tool can also be effective under similar geologic conditions. Wheninstalling wells, a chain tool may require a little more time, but may prove to be less disruptive to theformation in the vicinity of the well screen. Both techniques are well suited to collecting continuoussoil samples using a split-barrel continuous sampling device. This capability is extremely importantbecause detailed knowledge of the subsurface can be critical to the successful demonstration ofremediation by monitored natural attenation.A2-6At greater depths and in more competent formations, rotary and air hammer techniques are frequently used. Rotary techniques are also suited to penetration of cobbly units that may provedifficult or impenetrable to a hollow-stem auger or chain tool. With rotary rigs, the fastest drillingrates are usually achieved by using drilling fluids such as mud or water; however, these fluids mayrequire handling as IDW and may clog the pore space in the vicinity of the well screen. As long asair circulation can be maintained in the borehole, an air hammer can be particularly useful in compe-tent bedrock formations without introducing drilling fluids. A.2.2 CONE PENETROMETER TESTING CPT is increasingly being used for successful site characterization. CPT is accomplished using a cone penetrometer truck, which consists of an instrumented probe that is forced into the groundusing a hydraulic load frame mounted on a heavy truck, with the weight of the truck providing thenecessary force. Penetration force is typically supplied by a pair of large hydraulic cylinders boltedto the truck frame. In tight soils, push capacity is more often limited by the structural bendingcapacity of the push rods than by the weight of the truck. Cone penetrometers operate well in mostunconsolidated deposits; however, they may not be able to penetrate and may be damaged bycobbles, gravel layers, very stiff clays, and cemented units. The penetrometer probe generally consists of a 60-degree conical tip attached to a friction sleeve. Inside the probe, two load cells independently measure the vertical resistance against theconical tip and the side friction along the sleeve. Each load cell is a cylinder of uniform cross sec-tion inside the probe which is instrumented with four strain gauges in a full-bridge circuit. Forcesare sensed by the load cells, and the data are transmitted from the probe assembly via a cable runningthrough the push tubes. The analog data are digitized, recorded, and plotted by computer in thepenetrometer truck. Penetration, dissipation, and resistivity data are used to determine site strati-graphy. The cone penetrometer can be a very effective tool for collecting large quantities of subsurface information in a short period of time with virtually no waste generation. A cone penetrometer alsocan be used for installation of ground-water monitoring points, and specially equipped penetrometerscan be used to screen for mobile and residual fuel hydrocarbon contamination using laser inducedfluorescence (LIF). Although the equipment is fairly expensive, the overall efficiency can make thisoption relatively inexpensive. Most of the disadvantages of CPT are linked to the advantages. For instance, the speed and minimal waste associated with CPT are directly related to the process of determining lithology insitu; however, this does not allow for visual description of subsurface materials. Isolated soilsamples can be retrieved for visual description to calibrate the cone penetrometry log, but the proce-dure cannot be performed frequently (nor continuously) without impairing the efficiency of thepenetrometer. And while CPT can be very effective at precisely determining changes in lithology onthe basis of grain size, the lack of a visual description prevents stratigraphic correlation on the basisof other parameters, such as color. The U.S. DoD supports a technology development program forsite characterization using cone penetrometers (the SCAPS program). SCAPS has developed adown-hole CCD camera and light source that can visualize subsurface sediments. Monitoring points installed using a cone penetrometer illustrate another advantage that comes with disadvantages. CPT allows for rapid placement of discreet ground-water sampling points at aprecise depth selected on the basis of real-time, detailed, stratigraphic logs. The most effectiveemplacement technique allows for installation of monitoring points of not greater than approximately0.5 inch ID. While these points may not require much development or purging, ground-water extrac-tion for development, purging, and sampling becomes extremely inefficient if the depth to groundA2-7water is greater than approximately 25 feet. In addition, the monitoring point emplacement tech- nique typically does not allow for installation of a sand pack, bentonite seal, and grout slurry as maybe required by regulations. A.2.3 HYDRAULIC PERCUSSION SYSTEMS A variety of sampling tools can be advanced through unconsolidated soils using relatively inexpensive hydraulically powered percussion/probing machines (e.g., Geoprobe \u00ae). These sorts of systems are frequently mounted on pickup trucks or all-terrain vehicles and, as a result of their smallsize and versatility, can access many locations that larger equipment cannot. Hydraulic percussion systems provide for the rapid collection of soil, soil gas, and ground-water samples at shallow depths while minimizing the generation of investigation-derived waste materials.Specifically undisturbed, continuous soils samples can rapidly be collected for visual observation,field analysis, and/or laboratory analysis. In addition, ground-water samples can be collectedthrough the probe rods, or ground-water monitoring points can be installed for later sample collec-tion. Although monitoring points installed by hydraulic percussion systems can vary considerably indesign and can include sandpacks and seals, monitoring points are typically narrow in diameter. As aresult, it can be difficult to sample points where the ground-water elevation is greater than 25 feetbgs. Furthermore, the narrow diameter may not comply with regulatory standards or future useneeds.A3-8SECTION A-3 SOIL CHARACTERIZATION METHODOLOGIES As part of an evaluation of monitored natural attenuation for contaminants in ground water, soil characterization factors into development of a site conceptual model, estimation of continuing sourcestrength, and modeling of fate and transport. The following sections describe soil sample acquisi-tion, description, field screening, and laboratory analysis procedures. Samples should be collected inaccordance with local, State, and Federal requirements. A.3.1 SAMPLE ACQUISITION Soil samples can be collected using a variety of methods, depending upon the method used to advance boreholes. In all cases, the goal is to collect samples to allow lithologic logging and toprovide useable samples for field screening and for submission to an analytical laboratory. Thesamples should meet the appropriate data quality objectives as identified in the site-specific QualityAssurance Plan. When using hollow-stem auger or chain tool methods, relatively undisturbed continuous soil samples can be collected with split-barrel samplers that are either advanced using a hydraulic ham-mer or are driven along with the advancing auger. These are well-tested methods that are useful inmost types of soils except for saturated sands, in which samples tend to liquify and slide out of thebarrel. Collection of continuous samples allows a more thorough description of site geology, withonly a slight increase in the time required for drilling. These methods also can be used to collectsamples in various types of liners, such as acetate or brass sleeves. These sleeves can be cut, capped,and shipped with a minimum of effort. When using sleeves, the samples are disturbed less, butdescription of the soils may be hindered if the liners are not clear. Other traditional drilling methods(i.e., rotary) do not produce samples that can be used for chemical analysis, and will also makegeologic interpretation more difficult due to the disturbed nature of the material. If CPT or hydraulic percussion methods are used, soil sampled can be collected using a hydrau- lically driven sampler. When soil samples are collected using a probe-drive sampler, the probe-drivesampler serves as both the driving point and the sample collection device and is attached to theleading end of the driving rods. To collect a soil sample, the sampler is pushed or driven to thedesired sampling depth, the drive point is retracted to open the sampling barrel, and the sampler issubsequently pushed into the undisturbed soils. The soil cores are retained within brass, stainlesssteel, or clear acetate liners inside the sampling barrel. The probe rods are then retracted, bringingthe sampling device to the surface. The soil sample can then be extruded from the liners for litho-logic logging, or the liners can be capped and undisturbed samples submitted to the analytical labora-tory for testing. If a hand auger is used, samples will be slightly disturbed, but still useful for logging purposes. Removing soil from the auger bucket may prove difficult where soils are clayey. Below the watertable, it may be impossible to retain sandy soils in the bucket. Hand driven samplers are similar toprobe-drive samplers, except that all pushing power is provided manually, Following sample acquisition, the coordinates and elevation of all soil sampling locations should be surveyed. Horizontal coordinates should be measured to the nearest 0.1 foot relative to anestablished coordinate system, such as state planar. The elevation of the ground surface also shouldbe measured to the nearest 0.1 foot relative to USGS mean sea level (msl) data. A.3.2 PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION Physical characterization of soils should be performed at all sampling locations and a descrip- tive log prepared for the materials encountered. If using CPT, the descriptive logs should consist ofcontinuous computer-generated interpretations supplemented by periodic sensory confirmation andA3-9description. Otherwise, continuous sampling with interpretation and description is recommended in order to precisely identify and isolate changes in lithology. The descriptive log should contain: Sample interval (top and bottom depth); Sample recovery; Presence or absence of contamination; Lithologic description, including relative density, color, major textural constituents, minor constituents, porosity, relative moisture content, plasticity of fines, cohesiveness, grainsize, structure or stratification, relative permeability, and any other significant observa-tions; and Depths of lithologic contacts and/or significant textural changes measured and recorded to the nearest 0.1 foot. In addition, representative samples should be photographed, labeled, and stored. Additional site characterization features are frequently being added to the list of desirable parameters. Static porepressure and transient pore pressures during penetration with a cone penetrometer are examples. A.3.3 FIXED-BASE LABORATORY ANALYSES Portions of selected samples should be sent to the fixed-base laboratory for analysis. It is desirable to sample and submit a relatively undisturbed sample, if possible. Undisturbed samples aretypically collected in brass, stainless steel, or clear acetate liners inside of a sampling barrel. Uponremoval from the barrel, liners are cut to length (if desired) and capped. If the selected drillingtechnique, site conditions, or project requirements do not permit collection of undisturbed soils,samples for analysis of volatile constituents should be transferred immediately to an appropriatecontainer in such a way as to minimize volatilization during the transfer and headspace in the samplecontainer. The analytical protocol to be used for soil sample analysis is presented in Table 2.1. Thisanalytical protocol includes the parameters necessary to document the effects of sorption and toestimate the magnitude of the continuing source. The protocol document describes each soil analyti-cal parameter and the use of each analyte in the demonstration of remediation by monitored naturalattenuation. Each laboratory soil sample will be placed in an analyte-appropriate sample container and delivered as soon as possible to the analytical laboratory for analysis of total hydrocarbons, aromatichydrocarbons, VOCs, and moisture content using the procedures presented in Table 2.1. In addition,at least two samples from locations upgradient, crossgradient, or far downgradient of the contami-nant source will be analyzed for TOC, and the chemical and geochemical parameters necessary tocharacterize the processes and rates of reaction occurring within the plume.A4-10SECTION A-4 GROUND-WATER CHARACTERIZATION METHODOLOGIES This section describes the scope of work required to collect ground-water quality samples and to perform field analyses to evaluate the demonstration of remediation by monitored natural attenua-tion. Ground-water sampling should be conducted only by qualified scientists and technicianstrained in the conduct of well sampling, sampling documentation, and chain-of-custody procedures.In addition, sampling personnel should thoroughly review this protocol document and the site-specific work plan and quality assurance plan prior to sample acquisition and have a copy of thework plan and quality assurance plan available onsite for reference. Samples should be collected inaccordance with local, State, and Federal requirements. A.4.1 GROUND-WATER MONITORING LOCATIONS, DEPTHS, AND SCREENED INTERVALS Ground-water monitoring locations should be selected on the basis of the preliminary concep- tual site model and information on the three-dimensional distribution of contaminants. At a mini-mum, one monitoring location should be placed upgradient from the contaminant plume, one loca-tion should be placed in the suspected source area, two locations should be placed within the plume,and three locations should be placed various distances downgradient and crossgradient from theplume. The actual number of monitoring locations could be considerably higher and should berelated to site conditions and the size of the source. It is necessary to collect samples that document the vertical extent of contamination at several or at all of the ground-water monitoring locations. This decision is based on the presence of confin-ing units, the thickness of the aquifer, the type and source of contamination, and suspected variationsin subsurface transmissivity. The position of well screens should be selected by the field scientistafter consideration is given to the geometry and hydraulic characteristics of the stratum in which thewell will be screened. Wells should be screened so that the vertical distribution of contaminants andhydraulic gradients can be delineated. Typically the shallowest ground-water monitoring depth ischosen to intersect the water table. This allows for the monitoring of LNAPL and seasonal waterlevel fluctuations, as well as dissolved contaminant concentrations in the portion of the aquiferclosest to the typical source. Deeper locations are selected on the basis of contaminant distribution,typically above or below suspected confining units or in zones believed to possess higher transmis-sivity. To ensure well integrity, clustered monitoring wells/monitoring points generally should becompleted in separate boreholes. Screen lengths of not more than 5 feet are recommended to help mitigate the dilution of water samples from potential vertical mixing of contaminated and uncontaminated ground water. Screen-ing a larger area of the saturated zone will result in averaging of contaminant concentrations andhydraulic properties. In addition, short screened intervals used in nested pairs give important infor-mation on the nature of vertical hydraulic gradients in the area. A.4.2 TYPES OF GROUND-WATER SAMPLING LOCATIONS Ground-water samples for the demonstration of remediation by monitored natural attenuation can be collected from monitoring wells, monitoring points, or grab sampling locations. Monitoringpoints and grab locations provide rapid and inexpensive access to shallow ground-water, and yieldground-water samples that are appropriate for site characterization and plume definition. Conven-tional monitoring wells are required for sites with ground-water elevations more than approximately25 feet below ground surface. They also are recommended for long-term monitoring (LTM) andperformance evaluation ground-water sampling, and may be required for regulatory compliance. Following installation, the location and elevation of all ground-water monitoring locations should be surveyed. Horizontal coordinates should be measured to the nearest 0.1 foot relative to anA4-11established coordinate system, such as state planar. The elevation of the ground surface also should be measured to the nearest 0.1 foot relative to USGS mean sea level (msl) data. Other elevations,including the measuring point, should be measured to the nearest 0.01 foot. A.4.2.1 Monitoring Wells Monitoring wells are commonly installed to evaluate remediation by monitored natural attenua- tion. As used in this document, monitoring wells are assumed to have, at a minimum, a sand pack, abentonite seal, an annular seal, a surface seal, and an inside diameter of at least 2 inches. Monitoringwells are extremely versatile and can be used for ground-water sampling, aquifer testing, productrecovery systems, long-term monitoring, and performance evaluation monitoring. Although versa-tile, monitoring wells are relatively expensive to install and create relatively large quantities of wasteduring installation, development, and sampling. Detailed well installation procedures are describedin the following paragraphs. Of course, local protocols, regulations, type of drill rig, site conditionsand site-specific data uses should dictate actual well completion details. The monitoring well should be installed in a bore hole with a diameter at least 4 inches larger than the outside diameter of the well. At a minimum, blank well casing and screen should be con-structed of Schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with an inside diameter (ID) of 2 inches. Fre-quently, this diameter must be increased if the well may be used for a pumping test or certain typesof product or ground-water recovery. The screens should be factory slotted with appropriately sizedopenings (typically 0.010-inch). All well sections should be flush-threaded; glued joints should notbe used. The casing at each well should be fitted with a threaded bottom plug and a top cap con-structed of the same type of material as the well casing. The top should be vented to maintainambient atmospheric pressure within the well casing. It is possible that PVC will not be suitable foruse in wells intended to monitor high concentrations of volatile organic constituents. Once the well is in place, sand, bentonite, and grout are used to fill the remaining borehole annulus. Appropriately-sized sand must be packed along the entire length of the screen; however, itis desirable to limit the vertical distance that the sand pack extends to either side of the screen (i.e., atleast 6 inches but less than 2 feet) because the added sand pack can increase the portion of theaquifer that is effectively screened. A bentonite seal is placed on top of the sand pack. If conditionspermit, this seal should have a minimum thickness of 2 feet. A cement-bentonite grout is used to fillthe remainder of the annular space between the bentonite seal and the surface completion. Depend-ing on site conditions and facility preferences, either flush-mount or stick-up surface completionscan be used. Site conditions and local, State, and Federal requirements should ultimately dictatematerials selection and construction details. The field scientist should verify and record the boring depth, the lengths of all casing and screen sections, and the depth to the top of all well completion materials placed in the annulus between thecasing and borehole wall. All lengths and depths should be measured to the nearest 0.1 foot. A.4.2.2 Monitoring Points Where site conditions and the regulatory environment permit, monitoring points are ideal tools for rapidly and cost-effectively obtaining site data to evaluate a remediation by monitored naturalattenuation. Monitoring points can be installed and sampled rapidly while generating a minimalvolume of waste. Furthermore, some monitoring points cannot be used for ground-water or freeproduct level measurements. It is always useful when a site has a reasonable and adequate numberof monitoring wells. Detailed monitoring point installation procedures are described in the followingparagraphs. Of course, local protocols, regulations, available equipment, and site conditions shoulddictate actual well completion details. In this document, monitoring points are considered temporary or permanent ground-water sampling locations that do not meet the specifications of monitoring wells. Typically monitoringA4-12points are installed in small diameter boreholes using CPT, hydraulic percussion, or manually- powered equipment. As a result, monitoring points usually have an ID of less than 2 inches. Inaddition, because of the extremely small to nonexistent annular space between the borehole wall andthe monitoring point materials, they seldom have a sand pack, bentonite seal, and grout seal, particu-larly with an annulus of 2 inches. Because these components are missing, ground-water monitoringpoints should be installed only in shallow aquifers where installation of such devices will not resultin the cross-contamination of adjacent water-bearing strata. Like monitoring wells, monitoring points are typically constructed of Schedule 40 PVC casing and screen; however, monitoring points also can be constructed from Teflon \u00ae-lined tubing attached to a stainless steel, wire mesh screen. Because the screens are often installed without a sand pack, aslot size of 0.010 inch or smaller should be used. All monitoring point casing and screen sectionsshould be flush-threaded; glued joints should not be used. The casing at each monitoring pointshould be fitted with a bottom cap and a top cap constructed of PVC. The top cap should be ventedto maintain ambient atmospheric pressure within the monitoring point casing. Site conditions andlocal, State, and Federal requirements should ultimately dictate materials selection and constructiondetails. The field hydrogeologist should verify and record the total depth of the monitoring point, the lengths of all casing and screen sections, and the depth to the top of all monitoring point completionmaterials. All lengths and depths should be measured to the nearest 0.1 foot. A.4.2.3 Grab Sampling Ground-water grab samples are temporally and spatially discrete samples collected from bore- holes that are abandoned upon completion of sampling. In highly transmissive aquifers, the collec-tion of grab samples can provide a rapid, cost-effective alternative to the use of monitoring points.Like monitoring points, collection of grab samples generates minimal waste; however, they are notappropriate for aquifer testing, remediation systems, or long-term monitoring. Furthermore, becausethe locations are abandoned upon completion of sampling, analytical results cannot be confirmed,and ground-water levels at all locations cannot be collected over the space of a few hours for use inthe development of ground-water flow maps. In addition, if the aquifer is not particularly transmis-sive, sample collection can require hours resulting in inefficient equipment utilization. For thesereasons, installation and sampling of monitoring points typically is recommended where feasible.Several of the more common instruments used to collect ground-water grab samples include theHydroPunch \u00ae, Geoprobe\u00ae, points. An optimal site characteriza- tion approach often involves use of grab samples acquired by push technologies such as theHydroPunch \u00ae, Geoprobe\u00ae, cone penetrometer, or hand-driven points for a rapid, three-dimensional characterization of the site, then using that information to select locations and screened intervals forpermanent monitoring points. A.4.3 MEASUREMENT OF STATIC FLUID LEVELSA.4.3.1 Water Level and Total Depth Measurements Prior to purging or developing any water from a ground-water sampling location, the static water level should be measured. At all locations of sufficient diameter, an electric water level probeshould be used to measure the depth to ground water below the datum to the nearest 0.01 foot. Smalldiameter probes are commercially available for measurement of water levels in monitoring pointsand through Geoprobe \u00ae, HydroPunch\u00ae, and CPT pushrods. After measuring the static water level, the water level probe should be slowly lowered to the bottom of the well, and the total well depthshould be measured to the nearest 0.01 foot. If measuring from the ground surface, an accuracybetter than 0.1 foot is probably not practical. Based on these measurements the volume of water tobe developed or purged from the location can be calculated. If mobile LNAPL is encountered, theA4-13LNAPL thickness should be determined, and attempts should be made to sample both the ground water below the LNAPL layer as well as the LNAPL. If a sufficiently narrow water level probe is unavailable, hollow, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubing connected to a manometer can be used to determine depth to ground water. Themanometer will indicate when ground water is reached as the HDPE tubing is inserted into themonitoring location. The HDPE attached to the manometer will then be marked at the level of theground surface and removed. The depth to water will be determined by placing a tape measure nextto the HDPE tubing and measuring the length from the base of the tubing to the ground level mark tothe nearest 0.01 foot, if possible. A.4.3.2 Mobile LNAPL Thickness Measurements At sites where phase-separated hydrocarbons are present in the ground-water system, it is important to accurately measure the thickness of floating hydrocarbons. Accurate measurement ofhydrocarbon thickness allows for estimation of the amount and distribution of the hydrocarbon andcorrection of measured ground-water elevations. There are three methods that can be used to deter-mine the thickness of mobile LNAPL in a well, including use of an interface probe, a bailer, or tapeand paste. Interface probes generally operate on either light refraction sensors or density floatswitches to detect hydrocarbons and the hydrocarbon/water interface. The depth to mobile LNAPLand depth to water should be measured to the nearest 0.01 foot. The thickness of phase-separatedhydrocarbons should also be measured to the nearest 0.01 foot. Three consecutive measurementsshould be made to ensure the accuracy of the measuring instrument. A clear bailer can be slowlylowered into the well until it intersects the fluid but is not totally immersed. The bailer is thenretrieved, and the floating LNAPL can be visually observed and measured with an engineer's tape.The third method for measurement of floating hydrocarbon thickness is hydrocarbon paste and anengineer's tape. The paste, when applied to the tape, changes color when it intersects the hydrocar-bon and the hydrocarbon/water interface. Measurements of the mobile LNAPL thickness can bemade directly from the engineer's tape. It is extremely important to remember to thoroughly decon-taminate all equipment between well measurement events to prevent cross-contamination of wells.Equipment blanks, part of the Quality Assurance Program, will confirm the suitability of the decon-tamination activities. Measurements of mobile LNAPL thickness made in monitoring wells provide only an estimate of the actual thickness of NAPL at that location. Actual mobile and residual LNAPL thicknesses canonly be obtained from continuous soil cores. Correcting apparent mobile LNAPL thickness asmeasured in monitoring wells to true thickness is discussed in Appendix C. A.4.3.3 Mobile DNAPL Thickness Measurements DNAPL thickness in wells cannot be used to estimate actual DNAPL quantities on a site. A.4.3 GROUND-WATER EXTRACTION Varied equipment and methods are available for the extraction of ground water. The approach is determined on the basis of application (development, purging, or sampling), hydrogeologic condi-tions, monitoring location dimensions, and regulatory requirements. Ground water produced during extraction activities must be handled in a manner consistent with the investigation-derived waste (IDW) plan for the site. The method of handling and disposal willdepend on location and type of source, site contaminants, degree of contamination (e.g., free product,odor, air monitoring measurements), and applicable local, State, and Federal regulations. A.4.3.1 Methods Portable ground-water extraction devices from three generic classifications are commonly used for investigations of monitored natural attenuation: grab, suction lift, and positive displacement.A4-14The selection of the type of device(s) for the investigation is based on type of activity, well/point dimensions, and hydrogeologic conditions. Bailers are common grab sampling devices. Disposable bailers can be used to avoid decontami- nation expenses and potential cross-contamination problems. Drawbacks for bailers include agita-tion/aeration of the ground water and the inability to maintain a steady, non-turbulent flow requiredto establish a true flow-through cell. Aeration also can be an issue during transfer of the samplefrom the bailer to the sample container. As a result of aeration, and because a true flow-through cellcannot be established, accurate dissolved oxygen and ORP measurements can be difficult to obtain. The suction lift technology is best represented in environmental investigations by the peristaltic pump. A peristaltic pump extracts water using a vacuum created by cyclically advancing a sealedcompression along flexible tubing. This pumping technique means that extracted water contactsnothing other than tubing that can be easily replaced between sampling locations. This reduces thepossibility of cross-contamination. Furthermore, peristaltic pumps can be used to extract minimally-disturbed ground water from any size monitoring location at variable low-flow rates. Because ofthese features, representative samples are simple to collect, and reliable flow-through cells aresimple to establish. The biggest drawback with a peristaltic pump is the maximum achievablepumping depth which is equivalent to the height of water column that can be supported by a perfectvacuum. This effectively limits the use of a peristaltic pump to monitoring locations with ground-water depths of less than approximately 25 feet. Also, off-gasing can occur in the tubing as a resultof the reduced pressures and high-rate of cyclical loading. If bubbles are observed in the tubingduring purging or sampling, the flow rate of the peristaltic pump must be slowed. If bubbles are stillapparent, the tubing should be checked for holes and replaced. The final potential disadvantage witha peristaltic pump is the low flow rate. Although advantageous for sampling, this can be inappropri-ate during purging or development at locations with large extraction volumes. Puls and Barcelona(1996) show that the use of peristaltic pumps does not compromise sample integrity as long as nobubbles form during sampling. If the ground water is saturated with methane or carbon dioxide, it ispractically impossible to collect samples without a gas headspace. Pankow (1986) gives advice onhow to correct for this problem. Positive displacement pumps, also called submersible pumps, include, for example, bladder pumps, II\u00ae, Bennett\u00ae and of these pumps operates downhole at depths of up to a few hundred feet and rates of up to several gallons perminute. Therefore, submersible pumps are particularly useful for applications requiring the extrac-tion of large volumes of water or for the extraction of ground water from depths in excess of 25 feet.Because the pumps operate downhole, they require appropriately-sized wells. At a minimum, aninside well diameter of at least 1.5 inches typically is required; however, much larger well diameterscan be required depending on the selected pump type, extraction depth, and extraction rate. Becausetypical submersible pump design results in contact between the ground water and internal as well asexternal surfaces of the pump, rigorous decontamination and quality assurance procedures must beimplemented to avoid cross-contamination if a pump that is not dedicated to the well is used forsampling. A.4.3.2 Development Monitoring wells and points should be developed prior to sampling to remove fine sediments from the portion of the formation adjacent to the screen. Development is not required for grabsampling locations. Because development is intended to enhance ground-water production andquality through the removal of fine sediments in the immediate vicinity of the screen, high flow ratesand downhole turbulence are beneficial. This is particularly true for monitoring wells because of theformation disturbance usually associated with installation. Development can be accomplished usingA4-15any of the methods discussed in Section A.4.3.1 with selection dependent on well/point dimensions, well/point installation procedures, and hydrogeologic conditions. Development is accomplished through the removal of water from the well/point in combination with screen/sand pack cleansing through agitation of the downhole ground water. The \"agitation\" istypically provided by pumping at a high flow rate; surging with the pump, a surge block, or a bailer;and/or pumping along the entire length of the screen. As a rule, the more \"agitation\" that can beprovided, the \"better\" the development. Typically during development, ground water is extracteduntil dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, specific conductivity, and water clarity (turbidity) stabilize.Monitoring well/point development should occur a minimum of 24 hours prior to sampling. Devel-opment water must be handled in accordance with the site IDW plan. It is important to maintain a record of development for each location. The development record should include the following information, at a minimum: Monitoring point/well number; Date and time of development; Development method; Monitoring point/well depth; Volume of water produced; Description of water produced; Post-development water level and monitoring point/well depth; and Field analytical measurements, including pH, temperature, and specific conductivity. A.4.3.3 Purging Purging consists of the evacuation of water from the monitoring location prior to sampling, so that \"fresh\" formation water will enter the monitoring location and be available for sampling. Be-cause sampling can occur immediately upon completion of purging, it is best to limit ground-wateragitation, and consequently, aeration of the ground water and volatilization of contaminants. Twosources for agitation include the purging device and the cascading of water down the screen as thewater level in the well drops. To avoid agitation, a low-disturbance device such as a peristaltic pumpor bladder pump is recommended for purging, while equipment such as bailers should be avoided.To avoid aeration, wells or points that were initially screened below the water table should bepumped at a rate which prevents lowering of the water table to below the top of the screen, and ifpractical, wells or points screened across the water table should be pumped at a rate that lowers thetotal height of the water column no more than 10 percent of the screened interval. Purging shouldfollow the recommendations of Puls and Barcelona (1996). Typically, the volume of water contained within the monitoring well/point casing is used to estimate the amount of ground water that should be removed during the purge. As a general rule,three times the calculated volume should be removed from the well/monitoring point; however, thiscan be reduced to between 1 and 3 volumes for low-producing wells and wells with a very largewater column, but a very short screened interval. Purging should continue until parameters such aspH, temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, and ORP stabilize. Sampling should occuras soon after purging as practical, and definitely within 24 hours. Purge waters must be handled inaccordance with the site IDW plan. If a monitoring well/monitoring point is evacuated to a dry state during purging, the monitoring well/monitoring point should be allowed to recharge, and the sample should be collected as soon assufficient water is present in the monitoring well or monitoring point to obtain the necessary samplequantity. Sample compositing or sampling over a lengthy period by accumulating small volumes ofwater at different times to obtain a sample of sufficient volume should be avoided.A4-16It is important to record purge information as a part of the sampling record for each location. At a minimum, the following information pertaining to the purge should be recorded: Monitoring point/well number; Date and time of purge; Purge method; Monitoring point/well depth; Volume of water produced; Description of water produced; Post-purge water level; and Field analytical measurements, including pH, temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and ORP; Thickness of LNAPL, if present, in the point/well prior to purging; Volume of LNAPL removed during purging. A.4.3.4 Sampling Sampling should occur immediately after purging. If well yield is less than 1/10 of a liter per minute, sample according to the guidance provided by Puls and Barcelona (1996). The object ofsampling is the collection of representative ground-water samples. This means that impact to thesample as a result of turbulence, contact with equipment, or a change in conditions must be mini-mized. The use of a peristaltic pump with dedicated HDPE tubing is recommended for monitoringlocations where the depth to water is less than 25 feet because the peristaltic pump is capable ofproviding a steady, low-flow, stream of ground water which has contacted only dedicated tubing. Inaddition, conditions are relatively unchanged, so long as care is taken to ensure that the pumpingsuction does not cause the ground water to boil as a result of the reduced pressure. Where the depthto ground water is greater than 25 feet, a dedicated positive displacement pump, when available, isbest. Because of the decontamination difficulties and the resulting potential for cross-contaminationassociated with most positive displacement pumps, sampling through these pumps is not recom-mended unless the pumps are dedicated. A bailer should be used only if it is the only means ofobtaining a sample. An overflow cell, such as the one pictured on Figure A.4.1, or a flow-through cell as pictured in Figure A.4.2, should be used for the measurement of well-head parameters, including pH, tempera-ture, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, and ORP. When using a pump to purge or sample, thepump intake tubing should be positioned near the bottom of the cell. If using a bailer, the watershould be drained from the bottom of the bailer through tubing into the cell. In either case, thetubing should be immersed alongside the dissolved oxygen probe beneath the water level in the cell.This will minimize aeration and keep water flowing past the dissolved oxygen probe's samplingmembrane. The probes for the other parameters are less sensitive to positioning within the flow-through cell. Samples should be collected directly from the pump discharge tube or bailer into a sample container of appropriate size, style, and preservation for the desired analysis. Water should bedirected down the inner walls of the sample bottle to minimize aeration of the sample. All samplesto be analyzed for volatile constituents (e.g., SW8010, SW8020, SW8240, and TPH-g) ordissolved gases (e.g., methane, ethane, and ethene) must be filled and sealed so that no air spaceremains in the container. Sample handling procedures are further described in Section A.6.A4-17Tubing from Pump or Bailer Dissolved Oxygen or ORP Probe Erlenmeyer Flask or Flow-Through Cell Figure A.4.1 Overflow cell to prevent alteration of geochemical properties of ground water by exposure to the atmosphere. Electrode No Headspace Figure A.4.2 . Flow-through cell to prevent alteration of geochemical properties of ground water by exposure to the atmosphere. A.4.4 GROUND-WATER ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES In order to demonstrate the efficacy of monitored natural attenuation, field and laboratory analyses should be performed on all ground-water samples using the analytical procedures listed inTable 2.1. As a result of analyte properties and available detection equipment, analyses can beperformed at the sampling location, a portable field laboratory, or a fixed-base laboratory. Thedissolved hydrogen analysis is unique in that it requires a combination of well-head and field labora-tory procedures that are somewhat different from other field methods; therefore, it is presented in aseparate subsection. Several of the analytes or parameters can be measured in more than one man-ner; consequently, the methods provided in this section should not be considered absolute. Rather,these methods have been proven to provide reliable information. The site-specific data quality needsA4-18of each project will be determined during the Data Quality Objective Process and documented in the Quality Assurance Plan. In order to obtain accurate and defensible data, it is critical that quality assurance procedures are followed for all analyses. These procedures generally fall into the following categories: Collection and handling of samples; Calibration of direct read meters, chromatographs, colorimeters, and field instruments per manufacturer's instructions; Decontamination of equipment and containers; and Confirmation of results through analysis of blanks, duplicates, and other quality control samples. Actual procedures are equipment and analysis specific, and must be developed accordingly. A.4.4.1 Standard Well-Head Analyses Standard well-head analyses include pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ORP because these parameters can be measured with a direct-reading meter. This allows all of theseparameters to be used as indicators for ground-water stability during development and purgingactivities. In addition, dissolved oxygen and ORP can be used to provide real time data on thelocation of the contaminant plume, especially in areas undergoing anaerobic biodegradation. Tem-perature, dissolved oxygen, and ORP must be measured at the well head in unfiltered, unpreserved,\"fresh\" water because these parameters can change significantly within a short time followingsample acquisition. Section 2.3.2 of the protocol document describes each analysis and its use in thedemonstration of monitored natural attenuation. It is critical that samples collected for well-head analyses are disturbed and aerated as little as possible; therefore, the use of a flow-through cell, as described in Section A.4.3 and illustrated onFigure A.4.1, is recommended. Where this is not possible, measurements can be made in a cleanglass container separate from those intended for laboratory analysis. Where ground-water extractiondisturbs the sample, downhole probes can be used for dissolved oxygen analyses, but such probesmust be thoroughly decontaminated between wells. In some cases, decontamination procedures canbe harmful to the dissolved oxygen probe, and inadequate decontamination can create potentialcross-contamination problems if performed prior to sample collection for the other analytes. Aftersample acquisition, the downhole ground water may be too disturbed to collect an accurate downholeDO measurement. A.4.4.2 Dissolved Hydrogen Analysis As described in Section 2.3.2.9, dissolved hydrogen (H 2) concentrations can be an indicator of microbially mediated redox processes in ground-water systems. Determination of H2 concentrations is a two-step process in the field: sampling at the well head and analysis with a reducing gas detector. Hydrogen is highly volatile, and this chemical property can be used to measure H2 concentra- tions in ground water. The principle is to continuously pump ground water through a gas-samplingbulb containing a nitrogen or air \"bubble\" so that the H 2 can partition between the gas and liquid phases until the concentration of H2 in the bubble comes into equilibrium with concentration of H2 in the ground water. The bubble is then analyzed for H2 and the concentration of H2 in the ground water is calculated using the Ideal Gas Law and Henry's Law. This method is referred to as the\"bubble strip\" method (Chapelle et al., 1995,1997), because the bubble \"strips\" H 2 out of the water. A.4.4.2.1 Sampling Method The following procedures are recommended for the collection of a sample for analysis by the \"bubble strip\" method: 1. Place the intake hose of a peristaltic pump, a Bennett positive displacement pump, or a blad- der pump into the sampling well at the depth of the screened interval.A4-19Do not sample for H2 with electrical submersible pumps because they may produce hydrogen. Do not sample for H2 from wells with metal screens or casings because they may produce hydrogen and interfere with measurements. 2. Attach a glass, 250-ml gas-sampling bulb (Figure A.4.3) to the outflow end of the tube.3. Turn on the pump and adjust the flow rate to between 400 and 700 mL/min.4. Briefly hold the outlet end of the sampling bulb in the upright position to remove any gas bubbles from the bulb. 5. Place the bulb in a horizontal position and inject 20 mL of hydrogen-free N 2 gas through the septum (Figure A.4.3). 6. Allow the N2 bubble to come into equilibrium with the flowing ground water for 30 minutes. This equilibration process takes approximately 20 minutes. 7. Remove 3-5 mL of the gas bubble using a 10 mL glass syringe with attached mini-inert valve.8. Close the valve to seal the sample.9. Wait an additional 5 minutes and repeat steps 7 and 8.10. Analyze both samples on the hydrogen detector, as described in Section A.4.4.2.2. Resample the well if the H 2 concentrations of the duplicate samples do not agree within 10 percent. Water Flow From PumpNitrogen Bubble Syringe Water Discharge250 showing the \"bubble strip\" method for measuring dissolved hydrogen concentrations in ground water. A.4.4.2.2 Analytical Method Concentrations of H2 in the nitrogen bubble are determined by gas chromatography (GC) with reduction gas detection (Trace Analytical, Menlo Park, CA). To perform this analysis, a gaseoussample is injected into the stream of a carrier gas such as N 2. The sample is transported by the carrier through a separation column where the components of the sample are separated on the basisof variations in their transport efficiency through the column matrix. The column is packed withCarboSieve II which separates chemical species primarily on the basis of molecular size. The sepa-rated components elute from the column and pass through a heated bed of HgO where the reducedgases (primarily H 2 and CO) are oxidized and Hg vapor is released. The concentration of Hg vapor released is directly proportional to the concentration of reduced gases present in the sample and isA4-20detected by means of an ultraviolet photometer. Because chlorinated solvents can destroy the HgO bed, the column is backflushed immediately after the H2 peak is quantified. The concentration of H2 dissolved in the ground water can be calculated from the equilibrated concentration in the nitrogen gas bubble as follows: 1) Prepare a calibration curve for H2 using a 100 ppm Scotty II standard gas mixture. The cali- bration curve should range from 0.1 to 10.0 \u00b5L/L (ppm). 2) Analyze the gas sample taken from the gas-sampling bulb, obtaining results (CB) in units of \u00b5L/L (ppm) in the gas phase. 3) Calculate the aqueous concentration of H2 (Cw in nanomoles per liter (nM)) in equilibrium with the equilibrated bubble gas (CB, \u00b5L/L (ppm)) sample using the conversion factor: CCWB=081. eq. A.4.1 This conversion factor is derived from the Ideal Gas Law and Henry's Law as follows: PV nRT= (Ideal Gas VP RT= eq. A.4.3 Where: n = the quantity of gas in molesV = the volume the gas occupies in LitersP = the partial pressure of the gas in atmT = the temperature in oK R = the gas constant (R = 0.08205 atm L mole-1 oK-1) Thus the concentration of a pure gas at atmospheric pressure and room temperature is 40.9mmoles/L. For a 1.0 ppm calibration standard (i.e., 1.0 \u00b5L/L), the H2 concentration in molar units would be: LH H gas eq. A.4.4 The dissolved H2 concentration in the concentration in nmoles/L Ch = the equilibrated bubble H2 concentration in nmoles/L HH2 = the dimensionless Henry's Law coefficient for the distribution of H2 between the gaseous and dissolved phases (HH2 = 50.4). 4) Identify the predominant terminal electron accepting process for the water sample using the characteristic ranges presented in Table 2.5. A.4.4.3 Field Analytical Laboratory Analyses The field analytical laboratory analyses to be used for ground-water samples are presented in Table 2.1. These analyses include parameters that are time-sensitive or can be performed accurately,easily, and inexpensively on site. In addition, results obtained from field laboratory analyses providereal-time data on the location of the contaminant plume, especially in areas undergoing anaerobicbiodegradation. This real-time data can be used to guide the investigation of monitored naturalA4-21attenuation at sites with limited or ambiguous hydrogeologic and plume information. Section 2.3.2 of the protocol document describes each analysis and its use in the demonstration of monitorednatural attenuation. In preparation for field laboratory analysis, all glassware or plasticware used in the analyses must be cleaned thoroughly by washing with a solution of laboratory-grade, phosphate-free detergent(such as Alconox \u00ae) and water, and rinsing with deionized water and ethanol to prevent interference or cross-contamination between measurements. If concentrations of an analyte are above the rangedetectable by the titrimetric method, the analysis should be repeated by diluting the ground-watersample with double-distilled water until the analyte concentration falls to a level within the range ofthe method. All rinseate and sample reagents accumulated during ground-water analysis must behandled appropriately, including collection, labeling, storage, and disposal. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a byproduct of naturally occurring aerobic and anaerobic biodegrada- tion processes that occur in ground water. Carbon dioxide concentrations in ground water can bemeasured in the field by titrimetric analysis using CHEMetrics \u00ae Method 4500 (0 to 250 mg/L as CO2), or similar. An increase in the alkalinity of ground water above background may be produced when carbon dioxide produced by biological activity reacts with carbonate minerals in the aquifer matrix material.Alkalinity of the ground-water sample will be measured in the field by titrimetric analysis usingU.S. EPA-approved Hach \u00ae Method 8221 (0 to 5,000 mg/L as calcium carbonate), or similar. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations are of interest because nitrate can act as an electron acceptor during hydrocarbon biodegradation under anaerobic soil or ground-water conditions. Nitrate-nitro-gen is also a potential nitrogen source for hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria biomass formation. Ni-trite-nitrogen is an intermediate byproduct in both ammonia nitrification and in nitrate reduction inanaerobic environments. Nitrate- and nitrite-nitrogen concentrations in ground water can be mea-sured in the field by colorimetric analysis using a portable colorimeter (such as the Hach \u00ae DR/700). Nitrate concentrations in ground-water samples can be analyzed after preparation with Hach\u00ae Method 8039 (0 to 30.0 mg/L nitrate), or similar. Nitrite concentrations in ground-water after preparation with U.S. EPA-approved Hach \u00ae Method 8507 (0 to 0.35 mg/L nitrite), or similar. Sulfate in ground water is a potential electron acceptor for fuel-hydrocarbon biodegradation in anaerobic environments, and sulfide is produced by biological sulfate reduction. Sulfate and sulfideconcentrations can be measured by colorimetric analysis with a portable colorimeter (such as theHach \u00ae DR/700) after appropriate sample EPA-approved to 70.0 mg/L sulfate) and 8131 (0.60 mg/L sulfide) (or similar) can be used to prepare samples andanalyze sulfate and sulfide concentrations, respectively. Iron III is an electron acceptor for biological metabolism under anaerobic conditions. Iron III is the substrate for biological iron reduction; Iron II is the product. Iron concentrations can be mea-sured in the field by colorimetric analysis with a portable colorimeter (such as a Hach \u00ae DR/700) after appropriate sample preparation. Hach\u00ae Method 8008 for total soluble iron (0 to 3.0 mg/L ferric + ferrous iron) and Hach\u00ae Method 8146 for ferrous iron (0 to 3.0 mg/L) (or similar) can be used to prepare and quantitate the samples. Ferric iron is quantitated by subtracting ferrous iron levels fromtotal iron levels. Manganese is a potential electron acceptor under anaerobic environments. Manganese concen- trations can be quantitated in the field using with a to 20.0 mg/L), or similar, can be used to prepare the samples for quantitation of manganese concentrations.A4-22A.4.4.4 Fixed-Base Laboratory Analyses The fixed-base laboratory analyses to be used for ground-water samples are presented in Table 2.1. These analyses include the parameters that cannot be easily or accurately performed in thefield, but are necessary to document monitored natural attenuation of fuel hydrocarbons and chlori-nated solvents in ground water. Section 2.3.2 of the protocol document describes each analysis andits use in the demonstration of monitored natural attenution. Prior to sampling, arrangements should be made with the analytical laboratory (or other sup- plier) to provide a sufficient number of appropriate sample containers for the samples (includingquality control samples) to be collected. All containers, preservatives, and shipping requirementsshould be consistent with the analytical protocol. For samples requiring chemical preservation,preservatives are best added to containers by the laboratory (or other supplier) prior to shipping.Sample handling is discussed in Section A.6.A5-23SECTION A-5 SURFACE WATER AND SEDIMENT CHARACTERIZATION METHODOLOGIES At sites where surface water bodies are affected (or potentially affected) by contamination, surface water and sediment sample collection and analysis may be required as a component of theremediation by monitored natural attenuation demonstration. A.5.1 SURFACE WATER SAMPLE COLLECTION Surface water can be collected with a peristaltic pump using exactly the same equipment and procedures to collect water from a well. The sampling tube can be introduced into the water from abarge or boat, or from a dock. The depth to the sediment should be sounded, then the tube intro-duced to a level a very few inches above the sediment layer. A weight can be used to keep the tubestraight. Alternately, \u00bd inch PVC pipe can be inserted to the correct depth, then sampled with a tubejust as if it were a well. Many plumes discharge at some distance away from the shoreline of lakes or large rivers. Samples should be taken at locations where the elevation of the sediment-to-water interface corre-sponds to the elevation of the contaminant plume in the aquifer. Many plumes are driven down intoaquifers by recharge. Conversely, the flow path bends sharply up underneath a gaining stream at thepoint of discharge. Water just above the sediment in the center of a stream or small river should besampled. If possible, the stage of a stream or river at a gauging station near the point of samplingshould be determined to estimate the discharge of the stream or river at the time of sampling. Losingstreams or rivers should not be sampled at high stage when they are losing water because groundwa-ter plumes would be pushed away from the sediment interface. To ensure that the stream is notlosing, the elevation of standing water in monitoring wells near the river should be higher than thestage of the river or stream at the time of sampling. The same considerations apply to tidal environ-ments or areas with wind seiches on large bodies of water. Surface water should be sampled whenthe tide is out, or the wind is blowing off-shore. Additionally, contaminant plumes may be deflectedstrongly downstream by flow occurring within the saturated material surrounding the surface waterchannel. This is particularly true when the hydraulic conductivity of the stream sediments is muchgreater than the hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding material that supplies ground water to thestream. A great deal of thought as to when and where to sample is necessary to yield meaningfulresults. A.5.2 SEDIMENT SAMPLE COLLECTION Sediment samples below the water surface can be collected using a core barrel. The core barrel can be hand driven to the desired depth from a boat, then pulled back up using a mechanical jackafter sampling is finished. An alternative technique is to place open-end, two-inch diameter PVCtubing to a desired depth, then insert flexible tubing and collect the sediment as a slurry into a suc-tion flask connected to a peristaltic pump.A6-24SECTION A-6 SAMPLE HANDLING This section describes the handling of soil and ground-water samples from the time of sampling until the samples arrive at the laboratory. A.6.1 SAMPLE PRESERVATION, CONTAINERS, AND LABELS Sample containers and appropriate container lids must be purchased or provided by the analyti- cal laboratory. Any required chemical preservatives can be added to the sample containers by theanalytical laboratory prior to shipping the containers to the site or alternatively, at the time of sam-pling. The sample containers should be filled and tightly sealed in accordance with accepted proce-dures for the sample matrix and the type of analysis to be conducted. The sample label should befirmly attached to the container side, and the following information legibly and indelibly written onthe label: Facility name; Sample identification; Sample type Sampling Sampling time; Preservatives added; and Sample collector's initials. A.6.2 SAMPLE SHIPMENT After the samples are sealed and labeled, they should be packaged for transport to the analytical laboratory. The packaged samples should be delivered to the analytical laboratory shortly aftersample acquisition using an overnight delivery service. The following packaging and labelingprocedures are to be followed: Abide by all U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) shipping regulations; Package samples so that they will not leak, spill, or vaporize from their containers; Place samples in a cooler containing ice to maintain a shipping temperature of approxi- mately 4 degrees centigrade ( oC), if required by the requested analyses; Include a properly completed chain-of-custody form, as described in the following subsec- tion; and Label shipping container with - Sample collector's name, address, and telephone number;- Laboratory's name, address, and telephone number;- Description of sample;- Quantity of sample; and- Date of shipment. A.6.3 CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY CONTROL After the samples are collected, chain-of-custody procedures must be followed to establish a written record of sample handling and movement between the sampling site and the analyticallaboratory. Each shipping container should include a chain-of-custody form completed in triplicateby the sampling personnel. One copy of this form should be kept by the sampling contractor aftersample delivery to the analytical laboratory; the other two copies should be retained at the labora-tory. One of the laboratory copies will become a part of the permanent record for the sample andwill be returned with the sample analytical results. The chain-of-custody form should contain thefollowing information:A6-25 Unique sample identification number; Sample collector's printed name and signature; Date and time of collection; Sample location; Sample matrix; Sample size and container; Chemical preservatives added; Analyses requested; Signatures of individuals involved in the chain of possession; and Inclusive dates of possession. The chain-of-custody documentation should be placed inside the shipping container so that it will be immediately apparent to the laboratory personnel receiving the container, but cannot bedamaged or lost during transport. The shipping container is to be sealed so that it will be obvious ifthe seal has been tampered with or broken. A.6.4 SAMPLING RECORDS In order to provide complete documentation of the sampling event, detailed records must be maintained by the field scientist. At a minimum, these records must include the following informa-tion: Sample location (facility name); Sample identification; Sample location map or detailed sketch; Date and time of sampling; Sampling method; Field observations of - Sample appearance,- Sample odor; Weather conditions; Water level prior to purging (ground-water samples); Total well depth (ground-water samples); Purge volume (ground-water level samples); Sample depth; Sampler's identification; Field measurements such as pH, temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and redox potential (ground-water samples); and Any other relevant information.A7-26SECTION A-7 AQUIFER CHARACTERIZATION METHODOLOGIES Adequate characterization of the ground-water flow and contaminant transport system is an important component of the monitored natural attenuation demonstration. The following sectionsdescribe methodologies that are recommended to characterize the hydrogeologic system. A.7.1 HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY Hydraulic conductivity is a measure of an aquifer's capacity to transmit water and governs ground-water flow and contaminant transport in the subsurface. Methods for determining hydraulicconductivity in the field can include slug tests, pumping tests, and downhole flowmeter measure-ments. Hydraulic conductivity can also be measured during penetration with a cone penetrometer bymeasuring the transient pressure excursions in the pore water in front of the cone using a coneequipped with a pressure transducer in contact with the pore water. The method selected for a givensite will depend on the dimensions, locations, and screened intervals of site wells and monitoringpoints; site stratigraphy; equipment availability; budget; and waste handling requirements. A.7.1.1 Pump Tests A pumping test involves pumping one well at a constant rate for a specified length of time and collecting periodic water level measurements in both the pumped well and nearby observation wellsin order to determine aquifer hydraulic characteristics representative of a large area. As a rule,pumping tests provide more representative measurements of hydraulic parameters; however, theyrequire a greater commitment of resources (time, money, and equipment) that cannot be afforded byall projects. In addition, for pumping test results to be representative, site hydrogeologic conditionsshould not change appreciably over short distances. This section outlines methods that can be usedfor conducting pump tests in both confined and unconfined aquifers. For a more detailed discussionof how to conduct a pumping test, the reader is referred to the work of Dawson and Istok (1991),Kruseman and de Ridder (1991), and Driscoll (1986). The interpretation of aquifer pumping test data is not unique. Similar sets of data can be ob- tained from various combinations of geologic conditions. The interpretation of pumping test data isdiscussed in Appendix C of this protocol document. A.7.1.1.1 Pumping Test Design Prior to performing an aquifer pumping test, all available site and regional hydrogeologic information should be assembled and evaluated. Such data should include ground-water flow direc-tion, hydraulic gradients, other geohydraulic properties, site stratigraphy, well construction details,regional water level trends, and the performance of other pumping wells in the vicinity of the testarea. This information is used to select test duration, proposed pumping rates, and pumping well andequipment dimensions. The precise location of an aquifer test is chosen to be representative of the area under study. In addition, the location is selected on the basis of numerous other criteria, including: Size of the investigation area; Uniformity and homogeneity of the aquifer; Distribution of contaminant sources and dissolved contaminant plumes; Location of known or suspected recharge or barrier boundary conditions; Availability of pumping and/or observation wells of appropriate dimension and screened at the desired depth; and Requirements for handling discharge. The dimensions and screened interval of the pumping well must be appropriate for the tested aquifer. For example, the diameter of the well must be sufficient to accommodate pumping equip-A7-27ment capable of sustaining the desired flow rate at the given water depth. In addition, if testing a confined aquifer that is relatively thin, the pumping well should be screened for the entire thicknessof the aquifer. For an unconfined aquifer, the wells should be screened in the bottom one-third ortwo-thirds of the saturated zone. Any number of observation wells may be used. The number chosen is contingent upon both cost and the need to obtain the maximum amount of accurate and reliable data. If three or moreobservation wells are to be installed, and there is a known boundary condition, the wells should beplaced along a radial line extending from the pumping well toward the boundary, with one wellplaced perpendicular to the line of observation wells to determine whether radial anisotropy existswithin the aquifer. If two observation wells are to be installed, they should be placed in a triangularpattern, non-equidistant from the pumping well. Observation wells should be located at distancesand depths appropriate for the planned method for analysis of the aquifer test data. Observation wellspacing should be determined based upon expected drawdown conditions that are the result of thestudies of geohydraulic properties, proposed pumping test duration, and proposed pumping rate.Preliminary pumping results should also be used (if available). Not all projects can afford the luxuryof preliminary testing. The equipment needed to perform aquifer pumping tests includes: Pumps Conductivity meter, pH meter, and thermometer Gate valve Barometer Electrical generator Semi-log and log-log graph paper Flow meter with totalizer Portable computer Water level indicators Field printer for data Pressure gauge Type matching curves Field logbook/forms Meter and stopwatch for discharge measurement Pressure transducers and data recorder Hose or pipe for transfer of water Engineer's tape calibrated to 0.01 ft Adequately sized tank for storing contaminated 5-gallon pail water Pumping equipment should conform to the size of the well and be capable of delivering the estimated range of pumping rates. The selection of flow meter, gate valve, and water transfer linesshould be based on anticipated rates of water discharge. Both the discharge rate and test durationshould be considered when selecting a tank for storing discharge water if the water cannot be re-leased directly to the ground, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, or nearby water treatment facility. In areas of severe winter climates, where the frost line may extend to depths of several feet, pumping tests should be avoided during cold weather months where the water table is less than 12feet from the surface. Under certain conditions, the frozen soil acts as a confining stratum, andcombined with leaky aquifer and delayed storage characteristics, test results may be unreliable. A.7.1.1.2 Preparation for Testing Barometric changes may affect water levels in wells, particularly in semiconfined and confined aquifers. A change in barometric pressure may cause a change in the water level. Therefore, for atleast 24 hours prior to performing a pumping test, barometric pressure and water levels in the testwell, observation wells, and a well beyond the influence of the pumping well should be measuredhourly to establish trends in ground-water level fluctuation. If a trend is apparent, the barometricpressure should be used to develop curves depicting the change in water level versus time. Thesecurves should be used to correct the water levels observed during the pumping test. Ground-waterlevels in the background well as well as barometric pressures should continue to be recordedthroughout the duration of the test.A7-28Test wells should undergo preliminary pumping or step drawdown tests prior to the actual test. This will enable fines to be flushed from the adjacent formation near the well and a steady flow rateto be established. The preliminary pumping should determine the maximum drawdown in the welland the proper pumping rate should be determined by step drawdown testing. The aquifer shouldthen be given time to recover before the actual pumping test begins (as a rule-of-thumb, one day). A record should be maintained in the field logbook of the times of pumping and discharge of other wells in the area, and if their radii of influence intersect the cone of depression of the test well.All measurements and observations should be recorded in a field notebook or on an Aquifer TestData Form. If data loggers with transducers are used, field measurements should be performed incase of data logger malfunction. A.7.1.1.3 Conducting the Pumping Test Immediately prior to starting the pump, the water levels should be measured and recorded for all wells to determine the static water levels upon which all drawdowns will be based. Data loggersshould be reset for each well to a starting water level of 0.0 foot. Water pumped from an unconfined aquifer during a pumping test should be disposed of in such a manner as not to allow the aquifer to be recharged by infiltration during the test. This means thatthe water must be piped away from the well and associated observation wells. Recharge couldadversely affect the results. Also, if contaminated water is pumped during the test, the water must bestored and treated or disposed of according to the project work plan for the study. The dischargewater may be temporarily stored in drums, a lined, bermed area, or tanks. If necessary, it should betransported and staged in a designated secure area. The discharge rate should be measured frequently throughout the test and controlled to maintain it as constant as possible, after the initial excess discharge has been stabilized. This can be achievedby using a control valve. The pitch or rhythm of the pump or generators provides a check on performance. If there is a sudden change in pitch, the discharge should be checked immediately and proper adjustments to thecontrol valve or the engine speed should be made, if necessary. Do not allow the pump to breaksuction during the test. Allow for maximum drawdown of the well during the step drawdown test. Ifdone properly, the flow control valve can be pre-set for the test and will not have to be adjustedduring pumping. If the pump does shut down during the test, make necessary adjustments and restartthe test after the well has stabilized. For a confined aquifer, the water level in the pumping wellshould not be allowed, if possible, to fall below the bottom of the upper confining stratum during apumping test. At least 10 measurements of drawdown for each log cycle of time should be made both in the test well and the observation wells. Data loggers can be set to record in log time, which is veryuseful for data analysis. A suggested schedule for recording water level measurements made byhand is as follows: 0 to 10 minutes - 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.5, 8, and 10 minutes. It is important in the early part of the test to record with maximum accuracy the time at which readings aretaken. 10 to 100 minutes - 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 65, 80, and 100 minutes. Then, at 1-hour intervals from 120 minutes to 1,440 minutes (one day) and every 2 hours after 1 complete day. Initially, there should be sufficient field personnel to station one person at each well used in thepumping test (unless an automatic water-level recording system has been installed). After the firsttwo hours of pumping, two people are usually sufficient to complete the test. A third person may beneeded when treatment of the pumped water is required prior to discharge. It is advisable for at leastA7-29one field member to have experience in the performance of pump tests, and for all field personnel to have a basic familiarity with conducting the test and gathering data. Field personnel should be aware that electronic equipment sometimes fails in the field. Some field crews have experienced complete loss of data due to failure of a logger or transducer. It is agood idea to record data in the field logbook or on a manual form as the data are produced. Thatway, the data are not lost should the equipment fail. The discharge or pumping rate should be measured with a flow meter that also has a totalizer. When the pumping is complete, the total gallons pumped are divided by the time of pumping toobtain the average discharge rate for the test. Periodic checking and recording of the pumping rateduring the test also should be performed. The total pumping time for a test depends on the type of aquifer and degree of accuracy desired. Economizing on the duration of pumping is not recommended. More reliable results are obtained ifpumping continues until the cone of depression achieves a stabilized condition. The cone of depres-sion will continue to expand at an ever-decreasing rate until recharge of the aquifer equals the pump-ing rate, and a steady-state condition is established. The time required for steady-state flow to occurmay vary from a few hours to years. Under normal conditions, it is a good practice to continue a pumping test in a confined aquifer for at least 24 hours, and in an unconfined aquifer for a minimum of 72 hours. A longer duration ofpumping may reveal the presence of boundary conditions or delayed yield. Use of portable comput-ers allows time/drawdown plots to be made in the field. If data loggers are used to monitor waterlevels, hard copies of the data printed on field printers should be obtained before transporting thelogger back to the office for downloading. A.7.1.2 Slug Tests A slug test is a single-well hydraulic test used to determine the hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the well. Because hydraulic conductivity varies spatially withinand between aquifers and because slug test results reflect aquifer conditions only in the immediatevicinity of the tested well, slug tests should be conducted in as many wells as possible at a site. Slugtests can be used for both confined and unconfined aquifers that have transmissivities of less thanapproximately 7,000 square feet per day (ft 2/day). Slug tests are accomplished by removing a solid slug (rising head) or introducing a solid slug (falling head), and then allowing the water level tostabilize while taking water level measurements at closely spaced time intervals. The method pre-sented herein discusses the use of falling head and rising head slug tests in sequence. The analysis ofslug test data is discussed in Appendix C. Slug testing should not proceed until water level measurements show that static water level equilibrium has been achieved. Unvented wells should be uncapped at least 24 hours prior to initiat-ing the test in order to allow the static water level to come to equilibrium. The protective casingshould remain locked during this time to prevent vandalism. During the slug test, the water levelchange should be influenced only by the introduction or removal of the slug volume. Other factors,such as inadequate well development or extended pumping, may lead to inaccurate results. It is thefield scientist's responsibility to decide when static equilibrium has been reached in the well. The following equipment is needed to conduct a slug test: Teflon \u00ae, PVC, or metal slug Nylon or polypropylene rope Electric water level indicator Pressure transducer/sensor Field logbook/forms Automatic data recorder (such as the Hermit Environmental Data Logger \u00ae, In-Situ, Inc. Model SE1000B, or equal)A7-30The falling head test is the first step in the two-step slug-testing procedure. The following steps describe the recommended falling head slug test procedure: 1. Decontaminate all downhole equipment.2. Record pre-test information including: well number, personnel, climatic data, ground surface elevation, measuring point elevation, equipment identifications, and date. 3. Measure and record the static water level in the well to the nearest 0.01 foot.4. Lower the decontaminated pressure transducer into the well and allow the displaced water to return to within 0.01 foot of the original static level. 5. Lower the decontaminated slug into the well to just above the water surface in the well.6. Start the data logger and quickly lower the slug below the water table being careful not to disturb the pressure transducer. Follow the owner's manual for proper operation of the datalogger. 7. Terminate data recording when the water level has recovered at least 80 percent from the initial slug displacement. Immediately following completion of the falling head test, the rising head test is performed. The following steps describe the rising head slug test procedure: 1. Measure the static water level in the well to the nearest 0.01 foot to ensure that it has returned to the static water level. 2. Initiate data recording and quickly withdraw the slug from the well. Follow the owner's manual for proper operation of the data logger. 3. Terminate data recording when the water level has recovered at least 80 percent from the initial slug displacement. It is advisable to produce hard copies or backup electronic copies of the data logger output (draw-down vs. time) daily and before transporting the logger from the field site. A.7.1.3 Downhole Flow Meter Measurements Downhole flow meter measurements are used to investigate the relative vertical distribution of horizontal hydraulic conductivity in an open borehole or the screened portion of a well. Thesemeasurements are useful for identifying zones of elevated hydraulic conductivity that may contributeto preferential flow pathways and affect contaminant migration. Methodologies for interpreting datafrom borehole surveys are described by Molz et al. (1994). Flowmeter measurements should be performed at 1- to 3-foot intervals in test wells during both ambient conditions and induced flow conditions. Test data may be analyzed using the methodsdescribed by Molz et al. (1994) to define the relative distribution of horizontal hydraulic conductiv- ity within the screened interval of each well. Final results should be presented in tabular and graphi-cal forms and accompanied by appropriate interpretation and discussion. Estimates of bulk hydraulicconductivity from previous aquifer tests or results of single-well tests conducted in conjunction withthe flow meter survey can be used to estimate the absolute hydraulic conductivity distribution at eachwell. Borehole flowmeters should be calibrated prior to testing. Generally, 0.5-inch-ID and 1.0-inch- ID probes will be calibrated using a range of volumetric flowrates potentially applicable to most sites[e.g., approximately 0.04 liters per minute (L/min) to 10 L/min]. The following nine steps outlinegeneral procedures that can be used to conduct a downhole flow meter survey at a given location. Measure the water level, organic liquid (NAPL) interfaces (if present), and total depth (TD) prior to initiating the test. Calibrate the flow meter for the range of anticipated flow velocities before introducing the flow meter into the well or borehole. Lower the flow meter to the bottom of the well/borehole.A7-31 Slowly withdraw the flow meter, pausing to obtain measurements at intervals of approxi- mately 1 to 3 feet, depending on site conditions. This will provide a baseline under static(ambient) conditions. Conduct a short-term, single-well pumping test in the test well to stress the aquifer. Record drawdown using an electronic data logger with a pressure transducer. Monitor and adjust the ground-water extraction rate, as necessary, to maintain constant flow. Obtain the profile of the vertical flow at the same elevations occupied during the ambient profile upon stabilization of the flow rate. Analyze the data collected during the tests to estimate relative distribution of flow into the tested wells and the relative hydraulic conductivity distribution at each location (Molz et al., 1994). A.7.2 HYDRAULIC GRADIENT Hydraulic gradient, defined as the change in ground-water elevation with distance, is a key parameter governing the direction and rate of ground-water flow and contaminant migration. Be-cause ground water can flow in both the horizontal and vertical planes, both horizontal and verticalgradients are required for a successful demonstration of monitored natural attenuation. Hydraulicgradients are generally calculated on the basis of ground-water elevations measured in site monitor-ing wells or monitoring points using an electric water level indicator. Therefore, for the most com-plete representation of site hydrogeology, it is important to measure ground-water elevations from asmany depths and locations as available. Interpretation of ground-water elevations and the subse-quent calculations for hydraulic gradient are discussed in Appendix C. A.7.3 DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF GROUND-WATER VELOCITY Ground-water velocity is directly related to contaminant velocity; therefore, a determination of groundwater velocity is critical to the fate and transport portion of a demonstration of monitorednatural attenuation. Typically, ground-water velocity is estimated from the hydraulic conductivity,hydraulic gradient, and effective porosity as described in Appendix C; however, direct measurementof ground-water velocity can be obtained from dye tracer studies.B1-1APPENDIX B IMPORTANT PROCESSES AFFECTING THE FATE AND TRANSPORT OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN THE SUBSURFACEB1-2TABLE OF CONTENTS - APPENDIX B B-1 INTRODUCTION .............................................................................................................B1- 6 B.1.1 FATE AND TRANSPORT MECHANISMS .................................................................B1-6B.1.2 MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF SOLUTE using K oc...........................B2-20 B.2.3.4.2 Determining the Coefficient of Retardation using OVERVIEW OF BIODEGRADATION ....................................................................B3-30B.3.2 BIODEGRADATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS VIA USE AS A PRIMARY GROWTH SUBSTRATE...............................................................B3-33 B.3.2.1 Aerobic Biodegradation of No. Title Page B.2.1 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with continuous source resulting from advection only .......................................................B2-10 B.2.2 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only ...................................................B2-10 B.2.3 Plume migration in two dimensions (plan view) showing plume migration resulting from advective flow only with continuous and instantaneous source ...................................................................................................B2-10 B.2.4 Physical processes causing mechanical dispersion at the microscopic scale..............B2-11B.2.5 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only and the combinedprocesses of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion ................................................B2-12 B.2.6 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only and the combinedprocesses of advection B.2.7 Relationship between dispersivity and scale...............................................................B2-15B.2.8 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with continuous source resulting from advection only; the combined processes of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion; dispersion, and sorption ................................B2-16 B.2.9 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only; the combinedprocesses of concentration versus equilibrium concentration..................................B2-25B.3.1 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with continuous source resulting from advection only; the combinedprocesses dispersion, sorption, and biodegradation.......................................................................................B3-30 B.3.2 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only; the combinedprocesses Expected sequence of microbially-mediated redox reactions and Gibbs free energy of the reaction ................................................................................B3-42B1-5TABLES No. Title Page B.1.1 Summary of Important Processes Affecting Solute Fate and Transport .......................B1-7 B.2.1 Values from Hypothetical Batch Test Experiment .........................................................B2-25B.2.4 Henry's Law Constants and Vapor Pressures for Common Fuel Hydrocarbons and Chlorinated Solvents ............................................................................................B2-27 B.3.1 Biologic for Various Anthropogenic Organic Compounds...........................................................................B3-29 B.3.2 Some Microorganisms Capable of Degrading Organic Compounds..........................B3-31B.3.3 Trends in Contaminant, Electron Acceptor, of Reported Dechlorinating Laboratory Systems............................................................................B3-39 B.3.5 Electron Donor and Electron Acceptor Half Cell Reactions .........................

The environmental fateand transport of a contaminant is controlled by the compound's physical and chemical properties andthe nature of the subsurface media through which the compound is migrating. Several processes areknown to cause a reduction in the concentration and/or mass of a contaminant dissolved in groundwater. Those processes that result only in the reduction of a contaminant's concentration but not ofthe total contaminant mass in the system are termed \"nondestructive.\" Those processes that result indegradation of contaminants are referred to as \"destructive.\" Nondestructive include biodegradation and abiotic degradation mechanisms.Biodegradation may be the dominant destructive attenuation mechanism acting on a contaminant,depending upon the type of contaminant and the availability of electron donors or carbon sources.Abiotic degradation processes are also known to degrade chlorinated solvents; where biodegradationis not occurring, these may be the only destructive processes operating. However, the rates of abioticprocesses are generally slow relative to biodegradation rates. Remediation by monitored natural attenuation results from the integration of all the subsurface attenuation mechanisms (both nondestructive and destructive) operating at a given site. Table B.1.1summarizes the processes that affect fate and transport of chlorinated solvents and fuel hydrocarbonsdissolved in ground water. Important factors to consider include: The compound's soil/water distribution ground-water geochemistry. Nondestructive discussed in Section B-2. Biodegradation is dis- cussed in Section B-3. Abiotic degradation mechanisms are discussed in Section B-4. It is impor-tant to separate nondestructive from destructive attenuation mechanisms during the natural attenua-tion demonstration. The methods for correcting apparent attenuation caused by nondestructiveattenuation mechanisms are discussed in Appendix C. B.1.2 MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF SOLUTE FATE AND TRANSPORT The partial differential equation describing contaminant migration and attenuation in the saturated zone includes terms for advection, dispersion, sorption, and degradation. In one dimen-sion, the partial differential equation describing solute transport in the saturated zone is: Processes Affecting Solute Fate and Transport Process Description Dependencies Effect Advection Movement of solute by bulk contaminantproperties.Main mechanism driving movement in thesubsurface. Dispersion Fluid mixing due to ground- water movement and aquiferheterogeneities.Dependent on aquifer properties and scale of observation.

In one dimension, the partial differential equation describing solute transport with first-order decay in the saturated zone is given by: = tD RC xv time [T] Dx = hydrodynamic dispersion [L2/T] x = distance along flow path [L] R = coefficient of retardation [dimensionless]v x = transport velocity in x direction [L/T] = first-order decay rate [T-1] These equations serve to illustrate how the processes of advection, dispersion, sorption, and biotic and abiotic degradation are integrated to describe the fate and transport of solutes in thesaturated zone. These relationships were derived using the continuity (conservation of mass) equa-tion, which states that the rate of change of contaminant mass within a unit volume of porous mediais equal to the flux of contaminant into the unit volume minus the flux out of the unit volume (Freezeand Cherry, 1979). Processes governing flux into the unit volume include advection and hydrody-namic dispersion (including mechanical dispersion and diffusion). Processes governing flux ofthe unit volume include advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, dilution, sorption, reac-tions (most notably change in solute concentration may, therefore, be statedmathematically as: Change in Solute Concentration = Flux In - Flux Out \u00b1 Reactions The following sections describe the most significant reactions affecting this mass balance (and therefore the fate and transport) of organic contaminants in the subsurface. Methods for evaluatingthe flux through the system will be discussed in Appendix C.B2-9SECTION B-2 NONDESTRUCTIVE ATTENUATION MECHANISMS B.2.1 ADVECTION Advective transport is the transport of solutes by the bulk movement of ground water. Advec- tion is the most important process driving dissolved contaminant migration in the subsurface. Thelinear groundwater velocity in the direction parallel to ground-water conductivity [L/T] ne = effective porosity dH/dL = hydraulic gradient [L/L] Solute transport by advection alone yields a sharp solute concentration front. Immediately ahead of the front, the solute concentration is equal to the background concentration (generally zero).At and behind the advancing solute front, the concentration is equal to the initial contaminant con-centration at the point of release. This is referred to as plug flow and is illustrated in Figures B.2.1,B.2.2, and B.2.3. In reality, the advancing front spreads out due to the processes of dispersion anddiffusion, as discussed in Section B-3, and is retarded by sorption and biodegradation, as discussedin Sections B-4 and B-5, respectively. The one-dimensional advective transport component of the advection-dispersion equation is given by: = C tvC xx eq. B.2.2 Where: vx = average linear velocity [L/T] C = contaminant concentration [M/L3] t = time [T] x = distance along flow path [L] Equation B.2.2 considers only advective transport of the solute. In some cases this may be a fair approximation for simulating solute migration because advective transport is the main forcebehind contaminant migration. However, because of dispersion, diffusion, sorption, and biodegrada-tion, this equation generally must be combined with the other components of the modified advection-dispersion equation (equation B.1.1) to obtain an accurate solute trans-port. B.2.2 HYDRODYNAMIC DISPERSION Hydrodynamic dispersion is the process whereby a contaminant plume spreads out in directions that are longitudinal and transverse to the direction of plume migration. Dispersion of organicsolutes in an aquifer is an important consideration when modeling remediation by natural attenua-tion. Dispersion of a contaminant dilutes the concentrations of the contaminant, and introduces thecontaminant into relatively pristine portions of the aquifer where it may admix with more electronacceptors crossgradient to the direction of ground-water flow. Two very different processes causeB2-10Figure B.2.1 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with continuous source resulting from advection only.

The variable describing hydrodynamic dispersion, D, is the sum of mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion. Mechani-cal dispersion is the dominant mechanism causing hydrodynamic dispersion at normal ground-watervelocities. At extremely low ground-water velocities, molecular diffusion can become the dominantmechanism of hydrodynamic dispersion. Molecular diffusion is generally ignored for most ground-water studies. The following sections describe these processes and how they are incorporated intothe modified advection-dispersion equation (Equation B.1.1). B.2.2.1 Mechanical Dispersion As defined by Domenico and Schwartz (1990), mechanical dispersion is mixing that occurs as a result of local variations in velocity around some mean velocity of flow. With time, a given volumeof solute will gradually become more dispersed as different portions of the mass are transported atthe differing velocities. In general, the main cause of variations of both rate and direction of trans-port velocities is the heterogeneity of the porous aquifer medium. These heterogeneities are presentat scales ranging from microscopic (e.g., pore to pore) to macroscopic (e.g., well to well) to megas-copic (e.g., a regional aquifer system). Three processes are responsible for mechanical dispersion on the microscopic scale (Figure B.2.4). The first process is the variation in flow velocity through pores of various sizes. Asground water flows through a porous medium, it flows more slowly through large pores than throughsmaller pores. The second cause of mechanical dispersion is tortuosity, or flow path length. Asground water flows through a porous medium, some of the ground water follows less tortuous(shorter) paths, while some of the ground water takes more tortuous (longer) paths. The longer theflow path, the slower the average linear velocity of the ground water and the dissolved contaminant.The final process causing mechanical dispersion is variable friction within an individual pore.Groundwater traveling close to the center of a pore experiences less friction than ground watertraveling next to a mineral grain, and therefore moves faster. These processes cause some of thecontaminated ground water to move faster than the average linear velocity of the ground water andsome to move slower. This variation in average velocity of the solute causes dispersion of thecontaminant. Figure B.2.4 Physical processes causing mechanical dispersion at the microscopic scale. Heterogeneity at the macroscopic and megascopic scales also creates variability in ground water and solute velocities, therefore producing dispersion on a larger scale. Geologic features that con-B2-12tribute to dispersion at the macroscopic scale include stratification characteristics such as changing unit geometry, discontinuous units, and contrasting lithologies, and permeability andSchwartz, Even in aquifer material that appears to be homogeneous, relatively small changesin the fraction of fine sediment can change hydraulic conductivity characteristics enough to producesignificant variations in fluid and solute velocities and thus introduce dispersion. Larger geologicalfeatures will introduce dispersion at the megascopic scale. At this scale, structural features such asfaults, dipping strata, folds, or contacts will create inhomogeneity, as will stratigraphic features suchas bedding or other depositional structures. As a result of dispersion, the solute front travels at a rate that is faster than would be predicted based solely on the average linear velocity of the ground water. The overall result of dispersion isspreading and mixing of the contaminant plume with uncontaminated ground water. Figures B.2.5and B.2.6 illustrate the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion on an advancing solute front. The com-ponent of hydrodynamic dispersion contributed by mechanical dispersion is Dispersion v xx= B.2.3 Where: x = dispersivity [L] Mechanical dispersion has two components, dispersion (both hori- zontal and vertical) dispersion. Longitudinal dispersion is the spreading of a solute in a directionparallel to the direction of ground-water flow. On the microscopic scale, longitudinal dispersion Figure B.2.5 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with continuous source resulting from advection only and the combined processes of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion. Figure B.2.6 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only and the combined processes of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion.B2-13occurs because of velocity changes due to variations in pore size, friction in the pore throat, and tortuosity. Transverse dispersion is the spreading of a solute perpendicular to thedirection of ground-water flow. Transverse dispersion on the microscopic scale is caused by thetortuosity of the porous medium, which causes flow paths to branch out from the centerline of thecontaminant plume. B.2.2.2 Molecular Diffusion Molecular diffusion occurs when concentration gradients cause solutes to migrate from zones of higher concentration to zones of lower concentration, even in the absence of ground-water flow.Molecular diffusion is only important at low ground-water velocities, and therefore can be ignored inareas with high ground-water velocities (Davis et al., 1993). The molecular diffusion of a solute in ground water is described by Fick's Laws. Fick's First Law applies to the diffusive flux of a dissolved contaminant under steady-state conditions F = mass flux of solute per unit area of time [M/T]D = diffusion coefficient (L 2/T) C = solute concentration (M/L3) dC dx = concentration gradient (M/L3/L) For systems where the dissolved contaminant concentrations are changing with time, Fick's Second Law must be applied. The one-dimensional expression of Fick's Second Law is: dC dtDdC dx=2 2 eq. B.2.5 Where: dC dt = change in concentration with time [M/T] The process of diffusion is slower in porous media than in open water because the ions must follow more tortuous flow paths (Fetter, 1988). To account for this, an effective diffusion coeffi-cient, D*, is used. The effective diffusion coefficient (Fetter, determined by laboratory experiments [dimensionless] The value of w generally ranges from 0.01 to 0.5 (Fetter, 1988). B.2.2.3 Equation of Hydrodynamic Dispersion Hydrodynamic dispersion, D, has two components, mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion. For one-dimensional flow, hydrodynamic dispersion is represented by the followingequation (Freeze Cherry, 1979): DD xx x=+ * Where: Dx = coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion x direction [L2/T] x = longitudinal [L] vx = average linear ground-water velocity [L/T] D* = effective molecular diffusion [L2/T]B2-14Dispersivity is a parameter that is characteristic of the porous medium through which the contaminant migrates. Dispersivity represents the spreading of a contaminant over a given length offlow, and therefore has units of length. It is now commonly accepted (on the basis of empiricalevidence) that as the scale of the plume or the system being studied increases, the dispersivity willalso increase. Therefore, dispersivity is scale-dependent, but at a given scale, data compiled byGelhar et al. (1985 and 1992) show that dispersivity may vary over three orders of magnitude. The data of Gelhar et al. (1992) are presented on Figure B.2.7 (with permission from Newell et al., 1996). Several approaches can be used to estimate longitudinal dispersivity, x., on the field scale (i.e., macroscopic to megascopic scales). One technique involves conducting a tracer test. Although thisis potentially the most reliable method, time and monetary constraints can be prohibitive. Anothermethod commonly used to estimate dispersivity when implementing a solute transport model is tostart with a longitudinal dispersivity of 0.1 times the plume length (Lallemand-Barres andPeaudecerf, 1978; Pickens and Grisak, 1981; Spitz and Moreno, 1996). This assumes thatdispersivity varies linearly with scale. However, Xu and Eckstein (1995) evaluated the same datapresented by Gelhar et al. (1992) and, by using a weighted least-squares method, developed the following relationship for estimating dispersivity: xPLog [L] Lp = plume length [L] Both relationships are shown on Figure B.2.7. In either case, the value derived for dispersivity will be an estimate at best, given the great variability in dispersivity for a given plume length. How-ever, for modeling studies, an initial estimate is needed, and these relationships provide good startingpoints for a modeling study. In addition to estimating longitudinal dispersivity, it may be necessary to estimate the transverse and vertical dispersivities ( T. and Z., respectively) for a given site. Several empirical relationships between longitudinal dispersivity and transverse and vertical dispersivity have been described.Commonly, T is estimated as 0.1 x. (based on data from Gelhar et al., 1992), or as 0.33 x. (ASTM, 1995; US EPA, 1986). Vertical dispersivity ( Z) may be estimated as 0.05 x. (ASTM, 1995), or as 0.025x. to 0.1x. (US EPA, 1986). Some solute transport modelers will start with an accepted literature value for the types of materials found in the aquifer matrix. After selecting initial dispersivity values, the contaminanttransport model is calibrated by adjusting the dispersivities (along with other transport parameters, asnecessary) within the range of accepted literature values until the modeled and observed contaminantdistribution patterns match (Anderson, 1979). This is a two-step process. The first step is to cali-brate the flow model to the hydraulic conditions present at the site. After the ground-water flowmodel is calibrated to the hydraulics of the system, the contaminant transport model is calibrated bytrial and error using various values for dispersivity. There is no unique solution because severalhydraulic parameters, including hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, and dispersivity, arevariable within the flow system (Anderson, 1979; Davis et al., 1993), and other transport parameters such as retardation and biodegradation may not be well-defined. B.2.2.4 One-Dimensional Advection-Dispersion Equatio advection-dispersion by adding hydrodynamic dispersion to equation B.2.2. In one dimension, the advection-dispersion equation is given by: C tDC scale. Where: vx = average linear velocity [L/T] = contaminant concentration [M/L3] Dx = hydrodynamic dispersion [L2/T] t = time [T] x = distance along flow path [L] This equation considers both advection and hydrodynamic dispersion. Because of sorption and biodegradation, this equation generally must be combined with the other components of the modifiedadvection-dispersion equation presented as equation B.1.1 to obtain an accurate mathematical de-scription of solute transport. B.2.3 SORPTION Many organic contaminants, including chlorinated solvents and BTEX, are removed from solution by sorption onto the aquifer matrix. Sorption is the process whereby dissolved contami-nants partition from the ground water and adhere to the particles comprising the aquifer matrix.Sorption of dissolved contamination onto the aquifer matrix results in slowing (retardation) of thecontaminant relative to the average advective ground-water flow velocity and a reduction in dis-solved BTEX concentrations in ground water. Sorption can also influence the relative importance ofvolatilization and biodegradation (Lyman et al., 1992). Figures B.2.8 and B.2.9 illustrate the effects of sorption on an advancing solute front. Keep in mind that sorption is a reversible reaction and that at a given solute concentration, some portion of the solute is partitioning to the aquifer matrix and some portion is also desorbing andreentering solution. As solute concentrations change, the relative amounts of contaminant that aresorbing and desorbing will change. For example, as solute concentrations decrease (perhaps due toB2-16Figure B.2.8 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with continuous source resulting from advection only; the combined processes of advection and sorption. Figure B.2.9 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only; the combined processes of advection processes the amount of contaminant reentering solu-tion will likely increase. The affinity of a given compound for the aquifer matrix will not be suffi-cient to permanently isolate it from ground water, although for some compounds, the rates of desorp-tion may be so slow that the loss of mass may be considered permanent for the time scale of interest.Sorption, therefore, does not permanently remove solute mass from ground water; it merely retardsmigration. It is this slowing of contaminant migration that must be understood in order to effectivelypredict the fate of a dissolved contaminant. This section provides information on how retardationcoefficients are determined in the laboratory. It is not the intent of this document to instruct peoplein how to perform these experiments; this information is provided for informational purposes only.Linear isotherms and previously determined soil sorption coefficients (K oc) are generally used to estimate sorption and retardation. B.2.3.1 Mechanisms of Sorption Sorption of dissolved contaminants is a complex phenomenon caused by several mechanisms, including London-van der Waals forces, Coulomb forces, hydrogen bonding, ligand exchange,chemisorption chemical aquifer matrix), dipole-dipole forces, dipole-induced dipole forces, and hydrophobic forces. Because of their nonpolar molecular structure,hydrocarbons most commonly exhibit sorption through the process of hydrophobic bonding. WhenB2-17the surfaces comprising the aquifer matrix are less polar than the water molecule, as is generally the case, there is a strong tendency for the nonpolar contaminant molecules to partition from the groundwater and sorb to the aquifer matrix. This phenomenon is referred to as hydrophobic bonding and isan important factor controlling the fate of many organic pollutants in soils (Devinny et al., 1990). Two components of an aquifer have the greatest effect on sorption: organic matter and clay minerals.In most aquifers, the organic fraction tends to control the sorption of organic contaminants. B.2.3.2 Sorption Models and Isotherms Regardless of the sorption mechanism, it is possible to determine the amount of sorption to be expected when a given dissolved contaminant interacts with the materials comprising the aquifermatrix. Bench-scale experiments are performed by mixing water-contaminant solutions of variousconcentrations with aquifer materials containing various amounts of organic carbon and clay miner-als. The solutions are then sealed with no headspace and left until equilibrium between the variousphases is reached. The amount of contaminant left in solution is then measured. Both environmental conservative isotherms (ECI) and constant soil to solution isotherms (CSI) can be generated. The ECI study uses the same water concentration but changes the soil to waterratio. In CSI isotherm studies, the concentration of contaminant in water is varied while the amountof water and sediment is constant. In some instances, actual contaminated water from the site isadded. Typically, the samples are continually rotated and concentrations measured with time todocument equilibrium. True equilibrium may require hundreds of hours of incubation but 80 to 90percent of equilibrium may be achieved in one or two days. The results are commonly expressed as a plot of the concentration of chemical sorbed ( \u00b5g/g) versus the concentration remaining in solution ( \u00b5g/L). The relationship between the concentration of chemical sorbed (C a) and the concentration remaining in solution (Cl) at equilibrium is referred to as the sorption isotherm because the experiments are performed at constant temperature. Sorption isotherms generally exhibit one of three characteristic shapes depending on the sorption mechanism. These isotherms are referred to as the Langmuir isotherm, the Freundlichisotherm, and the linear isotherm (a special case of the Freundlich isotherm). Each of these sorptionisotherms, and related equations, are discussed in the following sections. B.2.3.2.1 Langmuir Sorption Model The Langmuir model describes sorption in solute transport systems wherein the sorbed con- centration increases linearly with increasing solute concentration at low concentrations and ap-proaches a constant value at high concentrations. The sorbed concentration approaches a constantvalue because there are a limited number of sites on the aquifer matrix available for contaminantsorption. This relationship is illustrated in Figure B.2.10. The Langmuir equation is describedmathematically as (Devinny of sorbed contaminant) The Langmuir model is appropriate for highly specific sorption mechanisms where there are a limited number of sorption sites. This model predicts a rapid increase in the amount of sorbedcontaminant as contaminant concentrations increase in a previously pristine area. As sorption sitesbecome filled, the amount of sorbed contaminant reaches a maximum level equal to the sites, b.B2-18B.2.3.2.2 Freundlich Sorption Model The Langmuir can be modified if the number of sorption sites is large (assumed infinite) relative to the number of contaminant molecules. This is generally a valid assumption fordilute solutions (e.g., downgradient from a petroleum hydrocarbon spill in the dissolved BTEXplume) where the number of unoccupied sorption sites is large relative to contaminant concentra-tions. The Freundlich model is expressed solution, (mg/ml) n= chemical-specific coefficient The value of n in this equation is a chemical-specific quantity that is determined experimentally. Values of 1/n typically range from 0.7 to 1.1, but may be as low as 0.3 and as high as 1.7 (Lyman et al. 1992). The simplest expression of equilibrium sorption is the linear sorption isotherm, a special form of the Freundlich isotherm that occurs when the value of n is 1. The linear isotherm is valid for adissolved species that is present at a concentration less than one half of its solubility (Lyman et al., 1992). This is a valid assumption for BTEX compounds partitioning from fuel mixtures into groundwater. Dissolved BTEX concentrations resulting from this type of partitioning are significantly lessthan the pure compound's solubility in pure water. The linear sorption isotherm concentration (mass contaminant/volume solution, \u00b5g/ml) The slope of the linear isotherm Kd.Figure B.2.10 Characteristic adsorption isotherm shapes.B2-19B.2.3.3 Distribution Coefficient The most commonly used method for expressing the distribution of an organic compound between the aquifer matrix and the aqueous phase is the distribution coefficient, Kd, which is defined as the ratio of the sorbed contaminant concentration to the dissolved concentration (mass contaminant/volume solution or \u00b5g/ml) The transport and partitioning of a contaminant is strongly dependent on the chemical's soil/water distribution coefficient and water solubility. The distribution coefficient is a measure ofthe sorption/desorption potential and characterizes the tendency of an organic compound to besorbed to the aquifer matrix. The higher the distribution coefficient, the greater the potential forsorption to the aquifer matrix. The distribution coefficient is the slope of the sorption isotherm at thecontaminant concentration of interest. The greater the amount of sorption, the greater the value of K d. For systems described by a linear isotherm, Kd is a constant. In general terms, the distribution coefficient is controlled by the hydrophobicity of the contaminant and the total surface area of theaquifer matrix available for sorption. Thus, the distribution coefficient for a single compound willvary with the composition of the aquifer matrix. Because of their extremely high specific surfaceareas (ratio of surface area to volume), the organic carbon and clay mineral fractions of the aquifermatrix generally present the majority of sorption sites in an aquifer. Based on the research efforts of Ciccioli et al. (1980), Karickhoff et al. (1979), and Schwarzenbach and Westall (1981), it appears that the primary adsorptive surface for organic chemi-cals is the organic fraction of the aquifer matrix. However, there is a \"critical level of organic mat-ter\" below which sorption onto mineral surfaces is the dominant sorption mechanism (McCarty et al., 1981). The critical level of organic matter, below which sorption appears to be dominated by mineral-solute interactions, and above which sorption is dominated by organic carbon-solute interac-tions, is given by (McCarty et al., owc=2001 08 4. eq. B.2.14 Where: focc= critical level of organic matter (mass fraction) As= surface area of mineralogical component of the aquifer matrix (m2/g) Kow = octanol-water partitioning coefficient From this relationship, it is apparent that the total organic carbon content of the aquifer matrix is less important for solutes with low octanol-water partitioning coefficients (Kow). Also apparent is the fact that the critical level of organic matter increases as the surface area of the mineralogicfraction of the aquifer matrix increases. The surface area of the mineralogic component of theaquifer matrix is most strongly influenced by the amount of clay. For compounds with low K ow values in materials with a high clay content, sorption to mineral surfaces could be an important factorcausing retardation of the chemical. Several researchers have found that if the distribution coefficient is normalized relative to the aquifer matrix total organic carbon content, much of the variation in observed K d values between different soils is eliminated (Dragun, 1988). Distribution coefficients normalized to total organiccarbon content are expressed as K oc. The following equation gives the expression carbon content Kd= distribution coefficient foc= fraction total organic carbon (mg organic carbon/mg soil) In areas with high clay concentrations and low total organic carbon concentrations, the clay minerals become the dominant sorption sites. Under these conditions, the use of Koc to compute Kd might result in underestimating the importance of sorption in retardation calculations, a source oferror that will make retardation calculations based on the total organic carbon content of the aquifermatrix more conservative. In fact, aquifers that have a high enough hydraulic conductivity to spreadhydrocarbon contamination generally have low clay content. In these cases, the contribution ofsorption to mineral surfaces is generally trivial. Earlier investigations reported distribution coefficients normalized to total organic matter content (K om). The relationship between fom and foc is nearly constant and, assuming that the organic matter contains approximately 58 percent carbon (Lyman et al., 1992): KKoc om=1724. eq. B.2.16 B.2.3.4 Coefficient of Retardation As mentioned earlier, sorption tends to slow the transport velocity of contaminants dissolved in ground water. The coefficient of retardation, R, is used to estimate the retarded contaminant veloc-ity. The coefficient of retardation for linear sorption is methods used to quantify the distribution coefficient and amount of sorption (and thus retardation) for a given aquifer/contaminant system are presented below. The first method involvesestimating the distribution coefficient by using K oc for the contaminants and the fraction of organic carbon comprising the aquifer matrix. The second method involves conducting batch or columntests to determine the distribution coefficient. Because numerous authors have conducted experi-ments to determine K oc values for common contaminants, literature values are reliable, and it gener- ally is not necessary to conduct laboratory tests. B.2.3.4.1 Determining the Coefficient of Retardation using Koc Batch and column tests have been performed for a wide range of contaminant types and concen- trations and aquifer conditions. Numerous studies have been performed using the results of theseB2-21tests to determine if relationships exist that are capable of predicting the sorption characteristics of a chemical based on easily measured parameters. The results of these studies indicate that the amountof sorption is strongly dependent on the amount of organic carbon present in the aquifer matrix andthe degree of hydrophobicity exhibited by the contaminant (Bailey and 1970; Karickhoff et al., 1983; Chiou et al., 1983). These researchers observed that the distribution coefficient, K d, was proportional to the organic carbon fraction of the aquifer times a proportionality constant. This proportionality constant, Koc, is defined as given by equation B.2.15. In effect, equation B.2.15 normalizes the distribution coefficient to the amount of organic carbon in the aquifer matrix. Be-cause it is normalized to organic carbon, values of K oc are dependent only on the properties of the compound (not on the type of soil). Values of Koc have been determined for a wide range of chemi- cals. Table B.2.1 lists Koc values for selected chlorinated compounds, and Table B.2.2 lists Koc values for BTEX and trimethylbenzene. By knowing the value of Koc for a contaminant and the fraction of organic carbon present in the aquifer, the distribution coefficient can be determined by using the relationship: KK fdo c o c= eq. B.2.19 When using the method presented in this section to predict sorption of the BTEX compounds, total organic carbon concentrations obtained from the most transmissive aquifer zone should beaveraged and used for predicting sorption. This is because the majority of dissolved contaminanttransport occurs in the most transmissive portions of the aquifer. In addition, because the mosttransmissive aquifer zones generally have the lowest total organic carbon concentrations, the use ofthis value will give a conservative prediction of contaminant sorption and retardation.B2-22Table B.2.1 Values of Temperature = 20oC cFrom Lyman al., 1992; Kow eEstimated from solubility fEstimate from solubility generally considered more reliable Lyman al., 1992; Temperature = 20oC hFrom Fetter, 1993 IAverage of 12 used to Koc from Kow or Kom jAverage of 5 equations used estimate kAverage using equations from Kenaga and Goring (1980), Means et al.

Batch tests are easier to perform than column tests. Although more difficult to perform, column testsgenerally produce a more accurate representation of field conditions than batch tests because con-tinuous flow is involved. Knox et al. (1993) suggest using batch tests as a preliminary screening tool, followed by column studies to confirm the results of batch testing. The authors of this docu-ment feel that batch tests, if conducted properly, will yield sufficiently accurate results for fate andtransport modeling purposes provided that sensitivity analyses for retardation are conducted duringthe modeling. Batch testing involves adding uncontaminated aquifer material to a number of vessels, adding solutions prepared using uncontaminated ground water from the site mixed with various amounts ofcontaminants to produce varying solute concentrations, sealing the vessel and shaking it until equi-librium is reached, analyzing the solute concentration remaining in solution, and calculating theamount of contaminant sorbed to the aquifer matrix using mass balance calculations. A plot of theconcentration of contaminant sorbed versus dissolved equilibrium concentration is then made usingthe data for each reaction vessel. The slope of the line formed by connecting each data point is thedistribution coefficient. The temperature should be held constant during the batch test, and shouldapproximate that of the aquifer system through which solute transport is taking place. Table B.2.3 contains data from a hypothetical batch test. These data are plotted (Figure B.2.11) to obtain an isotherm unique to the aquifer conditions at the site. A regression analysis can then beperformed on these data to determine the distribution coefficient. For linear isotherms, the distribu-tion coefficient is simply the slope of the isotherm. In this example, K d = 0.0146 L/g. Batch-testing procedures are described in detail by Roy et al. (1992). Column testing involves placing uncontaminated aquifer matrix material in a laboratory column and passing solutions through the column. Solutions are prepared by mixing uncontaminated groundwater from the site with the contaminants of interest and a conservative tracer. Flow rate and timeare accounted for and samples are periodically taken from the effluent of the column and analyzed todetermine contaminant and tracer concentrations. Breakthrough curves are prepared for the contami-nants by plotting chemical concentration versus time (or relative concentration versus number ofpore volumes). The simplest way to determine the coefficient of retardation (or the distributioncoefficient) from the breakthrough curves is to determine the time required for the effluent concen-tration to equal 0.5 of the influent concentration. This value can be used to determine averagevelocity of the center of mass of the contaminant. The retardation factor is determined by dividingthe average flow velocity through the column by the velocity of the center of mass of the contami-nant. The value thus obtained is the retardation factor. The coefficient of retardation also can bedetermined by curve fitting using the CXTFIT model of Parker and van Genuchten (1984). Break-through curves also can be made for the conservative tracer. These curves can be used to determinethe coefficient of dispersion by curve fitting using the model of Parker and van Genuchten (1984). When using the method presented in this section to predict sorption of the BTEX compounds, aquifer samples should be obtained from the most transmissive aquifer zone. This is because themajority of dissolved contaminant transport occurs in the most transmissive portions of the aquifer.In addition, because the most transmissive aquifer zones generally have the lowest organic carbonconcentrations, the use of these materials will give a conservative prediction of contaminant sorptionand retardation.B2-25Figure B.2.11 Plot of sorbed concentration vs. equilibrium concentration.0.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.00 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Equilibrium Concentration ( \u00b5g/L)Sorbed Concentration ( \u00b5g/L)IsothermTable B.2.3 Data from Hypothetical Batch Test Experiment Initial Concentration (\u00b5g/L)Equilibrium Concentration (\u00b5g/L)Weight of Solid Matrix (g)Sorbed Concentration* 297.04 20.42 20.42 53.27 * Adsorbed concentration = ((Initial concentration - Equilibrium Concentration) x Volume of Solution) / Weight of Solid Matrix B.2.3.5 One-Dimensional Advection-Dispersion Equation with Retardation The advection-dispersion equation is obtained by adding hydrodynamic dispersion to equation B.2.2. In one dimension, the advection-dispersion equation is given by: equation considers advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, and sorption (retardation). Be- cause of biodegradation, this equation generally must be combined with the other components of themodified advection-dispersion equation, presented as equation B.1.1, to obtain an accurate math-ematical description of solute transport.B2-26B.2.4 VOLATILIZATION While not a destructive attenuation mechanism, volatilization does remove contaminants from the ground-water system. In general, factors affecting the volatilization of contaminants from groundwater into soil gas include the contaminant concentration, the change in contaminant concentrationwith depth, the Henry's Law constant and diffusion coefficient of the compound, mass transportcoefficients for the contaminant in both water and soil gas, sorption, and the temperature of the water(Larson and Weber, 1994). Partitioning of a contaminant between the liquid phase and the gaseous phase is governed by Henry's Law. Thus, the Henry's Law constant of a chemical determines the tendency of a contami-nant to volatilize from ground water into the soil gas. Henry's Law states that the concentration of acontaminant in the gaseous phase is directly proportional to the compound's concentration in theliquid phase and is a constant characteristic of the compound. Stated mathematically, Henry's Law isgiven by (Lyman et air (atm) Cl= concentration in water (mol/m3) Henry's Law constants for chlorinated and petroleum hydrocarbons range over several orders of magnitude. For petroleum hydrocarbons, Henry's Law constants (H) for the saturated aliphatics,H range from 1 to 10 atm m 3/mol @ 25oC; for the unsaturated and cyclo-aliphatics ranges from 0.1 to 1 atm m3/mol @ 25oC; and for the light aromatics (e.g., BTEX) H ranges from 0.007 to 0.02 atm m3/mol @ 25oC (Lyman et al., 1992). Values of Henry's Law constants for selected chlori- nated solvents and the BTEX compounds are given in Table B.2.4. As indicated on the table, valuesof H for chlorinated compounds also vary over several orders of magnitude, although most aresimilar to those for BTEX compounds. The physiochemical properties of chlorinated solvents and the BTEX compounds give them low Henry's Law constants, with the exception of vinyl chloride. Because of the small surface area of theground-water flow system exposed to soil gas, volatilization of chlorinated solvents and BTEXcompounds from ground water is a relatively slow process that, in the interest of being conservative,generally can be neglected when modeling biodegradation. Chiang et al. (1989) demonstrated that less than 5 percent of the mass of dissolved BTEX is lost to volatilization in the saturated ground-water environment. Moreover, Rivett (1995) observed that for plumes more than about 1 meterbelow the air-water interface, little, if any, solvent concentrations will be detectable in soil gas due tothe downward ground-water velocity in the vicinity of the water table. This suggests that for por-tions of plumes more than 1 meter below the water table, very little, if any, mass will be lost due tovolatilization. In addition, vapor transport across the capillary fringe can be very slow (McCarthyand Johnson, 1993), thus further limiting mass transfer rates. Because of this, the impact of volatil-ization on dissolved contaminant reduction can generally be neglected, except possibly in the case ofvinyl chloride. However, Rivett's (1995) findings should be kept in mind even when consideringvolatilization as a mechanism for removal of vinyl chloride from ground water. B.2.5 RECHARGE Groundwater recharge can be defined as the entry into the saturated zone of water made avail- able at the water-table surface (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). In recharge areas, flow near the watertable is generally downward. Recharge defined in this manner may therefore include not only pre-cipitation that infiltrates through the vadose zone, but water entering the ground-water system due todischarge from surface water bodies (i.e., streams and lakes). Where a surface water body is inB2-27Table B.2.4 Henry's Law Constants and Vapor Pressures for Common Fuel Hydrocarbons and Chlorinated Solvents Compound Vapor Pressure (mmHg @ 25oC)Henry's Constant is part of the ground-water system, the definition of recharge above is stretched slightly. However, such bodies are often referred to as recharging lakes or streams. Recharge of awater table aquifer has two effects on the natural attenuation of a dissolved contaminant plume.Additional water entering the system due to infiltration of precipitation or from surface water willcontribute to dilution of the plume, and the influx of relatively fresh, electron-acceptor-charged waterwill alter geochemical processes and in some cases facilitate additional biodegradation. Recharge from infiltrating precipitation is the result of a complex series of processes in the unsaturated zone. Description of these processes is beyond the scope of this discussion; however, itis worth noting that the infiltration of precipitation through the vadose zone brings the water intocontact with the soil and thus may allow dissolution of additional electron acceptors and possiblyorganic soil matter (a potential source of electron donors). Infiltration, therefore, provides fluxes ofwater, inorganic species, and possibly organic species into the ground water. Recharge from surfacewater bodies occurs when the hydraulic head of the body is greater than that of the adjacent groundwater. The surface water may be a connected part of the ground-water system, or it may be perchedabove the water table. In either case, the water entering the ground-water system will not only aid indilution of a contaminant plume but it may also add electron acceptors and possibly electron donorsto the ground water. An influx of electron acceptors will tend to increase the overall electron-accepting capacity within the contaminant plume. In addition to the inorganic electron acceptors that may be dissolvedin the recharge (e.g., dissolved oxygen, nitrate, or sulfate), the introduction of water with differentgeochemical properties may foster geochemical changes in the aquifer. For example, iron (II) will beoxidized back to iron (III). Vroblesky and Chapelle (1994) present data from a site where a majorrainfall event introduced sufficient dissolved oxygen into the contaminated zone to causereprecipitation of iron (III) onto mineral grains. This reprecipitation made iron (III) available forreduction by microorganisms, thus resulting in a shift from methanogenesis back to iron (III) reduc-tion (Vroblesky and Chapelle, 1994). Such a shift may be beneficial for biodegradation of com-pounds used as electron donors, such as fuel hydrocarbons or vinyl chloride. However, these shiftscan also make conditions less favorable for reductive dehalogenation. Evaluating the effects of recharge is typically difficult. The effects of dilution might be esti- mated if one has a detailed water budget for the system in question, but if a plume has a significantvertical extent, it cannot be known with any certainty what proportion of the plume mass is beingdiluted by the recharge. Moreover, because dispersivity, sorption, and biodegradation are often notwell-quantified, separating out the effects of dilution may be very difficult indeed. Where rechargeenters from precipitation, the effects of the addition of electron acceptors may be qualitatively appar-ent due to elevated electron acceptor concentrations or differing patterns in electron acceptor con-sumption or byproduct formation in the area of the recharge. However, the effects of short-termvariations in such a system (which are likely due to the intermittent nature of precipitation events inmost climates) may not be easily understood. Where recharge enters from surface water, the influxof mass and electron acceptors is more steady over time. Quantifying the effects of dilution may beless uncertain, and the effects of electron acceptor replenishment may be more easily identified(though not necessarily quantified).B3-29SECTION B-3 DESTRUCTIVE ATTENUATION MECHANISMS - BIOLOGICAL Many anthropogenic organic compounds, including certain chlorinated solvents, can be de- graded by both biological and abiotic mechanisms. Biological degradation mechanisms are dis-cussed in this section; abiotic degradation mechanisms are discussed in Section B.4. Table B.3.1summarizes the various biotic and abiotic mechanisms that result in the degradation of anthropo-genic organic compounds. Biological degradation mechanisms tend to dominate in most ground-water systems, depending on the type of contaminant and the ground-water chemistry. Table B.3.1 Biologic and Abiotic Degradation Mechanisms for Various Anthropogenic oxidation Many organic contaminants are biodegraded by microorganisms indigenous to the subsurface environment. During biodegradation, dissolved contaminants are ultimately transformed into in-nocuous byproducts such as carbon dioxide, chloride, methane, and water. In some cases, intermedi-ate products of these transformations may be more hazardous than the original compound; however,they may also be more easily degraded. Biodegradation of organic compounds dissolved in groundwater results in a reduction in contaminant concentration (and mass) and slowing of the contaminantfront relative to the average advective ground-water flow velocity.

Figure B.3.2 Breakthrough curve in one dimension showing plug flow with instantaneous source resulting from advection only; the combined processes of B3-30B.3.1 OVERVIEW OF BIODEGRADATION As recently as 1975 the scientific literature reported the subsurface/aquifer environment as devoid of significant biological activity. It is now known that soils and shallow sediments contain alarge variety of microorganisms, ranging from simple prokaryotic bacteria and cyanobacteria to morecomplex eukaryotic algae, fungi, and protozoa. Over the past two decades, numerous laboratory andfield studies have shown that microorganisms indigenous to the subsurface environment can degradea variety of organic compounds, including components of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, jet fuel, chlori-nated ethenes, chlorinated ethanes, the chlorobenzenes, and many other compounds (e.g., for fuelssee Jamison et al., 1975; Atlas, 1981, 1984, and 1988; Young, 1984; Bartha, 1986; B. H. Wilson et al., 1986 and 1990; Barker et al., 1987; Baedecker et al., 1988; Chiang et Cozzarelli et Leahy and Colewell, 1990; Vogel, 1991; Evans et al., 1991a Edwards et 1992; Edwards and Grbic-Galic, 1992; Thierrin et al., 1992; Malone et al., 1993; Davis et al., 1994a and 1994b; and Lovley et al., 1995; et al., 1981;B3-31Table B.3.2 Some Microorganisms Capable of Degrading Organic Compounds(Modified from Roberts, 1992) Contaminant Alcaligenes sp. (multiple strains) , Pseudomonas sp. (multiple strains), P. putida, Staphylococcus epidermisModerate to High Miller and Guengerich, 1982; Roberts et al., Bouwer 1987; Bouwer 1988; 1989; 1996; Spain, 1996). Table B.3.2 presents a partial list of microorganismsknown to degrade anthropogenic organic compounds. Although we now recognize that microorganisms are ubiquitous in drinking water aquifers, the study of the microbial ecology and physiology of the subsurface, below the rhizosphere, is still in itsinfancy. However, great progress has been made at least in identifying, if not fully understanding,B3-32the numerous and diverse types of microbially-mediated contaminant transformations that can occur in the subsurface. Chemothrophic organisms, such as humans and most microorganisms, obtain energy for growth and activity from physiologically coupling oxidation and reduction reactions and harvesting thechemical energy that is available. Under aerobic conditions (in the presence of molecular oxygen)humans and many bacteria couple the oxidation of organic compounds (food) to the reduction ofoxygen (from the air). However in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions), microorganismsmay use other compounds as electron acceptors. Anaerobic microorganisms can obtain energy froma variety of electron donors such as natural organic carbon or many forms of anthropogenic carbonand electron acceptors such as nitrate, iron (III), sulfate, carbon dioxide, as well as many of thechlorinated solvents. The introduction of oxidizable soluble organic contaminants into ground water initiates a series of complex responses by subsurface microorganisms. Field and laboratory research suggests thatdistinct communities defined by the dominant electron acceptor develop which are spatially andtemporally separate. These communities are most likely ecologically defined by the flux of biologi-cally available electron donors and acceptors. The biological processes of these communities arepotentially useful as natural attenuation mechanisms, as the basis of new bioremediation technolo-gies, and as indicators of the extent and severity of the release. As electron acceptors and nutrientsare depleted by microbial activity during biodegradation of contaminants, the redox potential ofcontaminated aquifers decreases. This results in a succession of bacterial types adapted to specificredox regimes and electron acceptors. Metabolic byproducts of contaminant biodegradation alsoexert selective forces, either by presenting different carbon sources or by further modifying thephysical and chemical environment of the aquifer. Like organic and inorganic colloids, microorgan-isms possess complex surface chemistry, and can themselves serve as mobile and immobile reactivesites for contaminants. Under anaerobic conditions, most organic compounds are degraded by groups of interacting microorganisms referred to as a consortium. In the consortium, individual types of organisms carryout different specialized reactions which, when combined, can lead to the complete mineralization ofa particular compound. The metabolic interaction between organisms can be complex and may be sotightly linked under a given set of conditions that stable consortia can be mistakenly identified as asingle species. There seems to be several advantages to the consortial system, including: 1) Thissystem allows for the creation of microenvironments where certain types of organisms can survive inotherwise hostile conditions; 2) Reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be driven byfavorable reactions when they are metabolically linked within the consortium; and, 3) This systemtakes advantage of the diverse metabolic capabilities of microorganisms by allowing for the forma-tion and enrichment of associations that can utilize an introduced substrate faster than a singlespecies could evolve a novel complex enzyme pathway to degrade the same compound. It appears that subsurface microbial communities contain the metabolic diversity required to utilize a wide variety of organic contaminants as a primary growth substrate in the presence ofelectron acceptors such as oxygen. Some pollutants, especially the highly oxidized chlorinatedhydrocarbons, are not amenable to use as a primary growth substrate. Instead, these compounds areused as electron acceptors in reactions that rely on another source of carbon as a primary substrate orare degraded fortuitously via cometabolism. Thus, biodegradation of organic compounds in groundwater occurs via three mechanisms: Use of the organic compound as the primary growth substrate; Use of the organic compound as an electron acceptor; and Cometabolism.B3-33The first two biodegradation mechanisms involve the microbial transfer of electrons from electron donors (primary growth substrate) to electron acceptors. This process can occur underaerobic or anaerobic conditions. Electron donors include natural organic material, fuel hydrocar-bons, chlorobenzenes, and the less oxidized chlorinated ethenes and ethanes. Electron acceptors areelements or compounds that occur in relatively oxidized states. The most common naturally occur-ring electron acceptors in ground water include dissolved oxygen, nitrate, manganese (IV), iron (III),sulfate, and carbon dioxide. In addition, the more oxidized chlorinated solvents such as PCE, TCE,DCE, TCA, DCA, and polychlorinated benzenes can act as electron acceptors under favorableconditions. Under aerobic conditions, dissolved oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptorduring aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, the electron acceptors listed above are usedduring denitrification, manganese (IV) reduction, iron (III) reduction, sulfate reduction,methanogenesis, or reductive dechlorination. Chapelle (1993) and Atlas (1988) discuss terminalelectron accepting processes in detail. The third biodegradation mechanism is cometabolism. During cometabolism the compound being degraded does not benefit the organism. Instead, degradation is brought about by a fortuitousreaction wherein an enzyme produced during an unrelated reaction degrades the organic compound. As discussed in sections B.3.2, B.3.3, and B.3.4, biodegradation causes measurable changes in ground-water chemistry. Table B.3.3 summarizes these trends. During aerobic respiration, oxygen isreduced to water, and dissolved oxygen concentrations decrease. In anaerobic systems where nitrateis the electron acceptor, the nitrate is reduced to NO 2-, N2O, NO, or N2 via denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate nitrate concentrations decrease. In anaerobic systems where iron (III)is the electron acceptor, it is reduced to iron (II) via iron (III) reduction, and iron (II) concentrationsincrease. In anaerobic systems where sulfate is the electron acceptor, it is reduced to H 2S via sulfate reduction, and sulfate concentrations decrease. During aerobic respiration, denitrification, iron (III)reduction, and sulfate reduction, total alkalinity will increase. In anaerobic systems where CO 2 is used as an electron acceptor, it is reduced by methanogenic bacteria during methanogenesis, and CH4 is produced. In anaerobic systems where contaminants are being used as electron acceptors, they arereduced to less chlorinated daughter products; in such a system, parent compound concentrationswill decrease and daughter product concentrations will increase at first and then decrease as thedaughter product is used as an electron acceptor or is oxidized. As each subsequent electron acceptor is utilized, the ground water becomes more reducing and the redox potential of the water decreases. Figure B.3.3 shows the typical ORP conditions forground water when different electron acceptors are used. The main force driving this change in ORPis microbially mediated oxidation-reduction reactions. ORP can be used as a crude indicator ofwhich oxidation-reduction reactions may be operating at a site. The ORP determined in the fieldusing an electrode is termed Eh. Eh can be expressed as pE, which is the hypothetical measure of theelectron activity associated with a specific Eh. High pE means that the solution or redox couple hasa relatively high oxidizing potential. B.3.2 BIODEGRADATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS VIA USE AS A PRIMARY GROWTH SUBSTRATE Many organic compounds including natural organic carbon, fuel hydrocarbons, and the less oxidized chlorinated compounds such as DCE, 1,2-DCA, chlorobenzene, or vinyl chloride can beused as primary growth substrates (electron donor) for microbial metabolism. The following sec-tions describe biodegradation of organic compounds through use as a primary substrate under bothaerobic and anaerobic conditions. B.3.2.1 Aerobic Biodegradation of Primary Substrates Biodegradation of organic compounds is often an aerobic process that occurs when indigenous populations of microorganisms are supplied with the oxygen and nutrients necessary to utilizeB3-34Table B.3.3 Trends in Contaminant, Electron Acceptor, Oxidation-reduction potentials for various oxidation-reduction reactions.Analyte Terminal Electron Accepting Process Trend in Analyte Concentration During Biodegradation Fuel Hydrocarbons Aerobic Respiration, Denitrification, Manganese (IV) Reduction, Iron Reduction, MethanogenesisDecreases Highly Chlorinated Solvents and Daughter ProductsReductive Dechlorination Parent Compound Concentration Decreases, Daughter Products Increase Initially and Then May Decrease Lightly Chlorinated Solvents Aerobic Respiration, Denitrification, Manganese (IV) Reduction, Iron (III) Reduction (Direct Oxidation)Compound Concentration Decreases Dissolved Oxygen Aerobic Respiration Decreases Nitrate Denitrification Decreases Manganese (II) Manganese (IV) Reduction Increases Iron (II) Iron (III) Reduction Increases Sulfate Sulfate Reduction Decreases Methane Methanogenesis Increases Chloride Reductive Dechlorination Reduction, MethanogenesisDecreases Alkalinity Aerobic Respiration, Denitrification, Iron (III) Reduction, and Sulfate ReductionIncreasesB3-35organic carbon as an energy source. The biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons occurs rapidly under aerobic conditions and is discussed in Wiedemeier et al. (1995a). Some pollutants, especially the highly oxidized chlorinated hydrocarbons (i.e., those containing more chlorine substituents), arebiologically recalcitrant under aerobic conditions. However, some of the less chlorinated ethenesand ethanes such as DCE, VC, and the chlorinated benzenes can be utilizedas primary substrates and oxidized under aerobic conditions. During aerobic biodegradation (oxida-tion) of chlorinated solvents, the facilitating microorganism obtains energy and organic carbon fromthe degraded solvent. Of the chlorinated ethenes, vinyl chloride is the most susceptible to aerobic biodegradation, and PCE the least. Of the chlorinated ethanes, 1,2-DCA is the most susceptible to aerobic biodegrada-tion (chloroethane is more likely to abiotically hydrolyze to ethanol), while TCA, tetrachloroethane,and hexachloroethane are less so. Chlorinated benzenes with up to 4 chlorine atoms (i.e., chloroben-zene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, and tetrachlorobenzene) also have been shown to be readilybiodegradable under aerobic conditions (Spain, 1996). Pentachlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzeneare unlikely to be oxidized by microbial activity. B.3.2.1.1 Aerobic Oxidation of Petroleum Hydrocarbons Fuel hydrocarbons are rapidly biodegraded when they are utilized as the primary electron donor for microbial metabolism under aerobic conditions. Biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons occursnaturally when sufficient oxygen (or other electron acceptors) and nutrients are available in theground water. The rate of natural biodegradation is generally limited by the lack of oxygen or otherelectron acceptors rather than by the lack of nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus. The rate ofnatural aerobic biodegradation in unsaturated soil and shallow aquifers is largely dependent upon therate at which oxygen enters the contaminated media. Biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons is dis-cussed by B.3.2.1.2 chlorinated ethenes (e.g., PCE and TCE) are not likely to serve as electron donors or substrates for microbial degradation reactions. This is because the highly chlorinatedcompounds tend to be much more oxidized than many compounds present in a natural ground-watersystem.. Several microbes or microbial enrichments have been shown to be capable of TCE oxida-tion (Fogel et al., 1986; Nelson et al., 1986; Little et al., 1988); however, as noted by Vogel (1994), no strong evidence for the oxidation of highly chlorinated solvents has been derived from actualhazardous waste sites. Using microcosms from two different sites with no prior history of exposure to DCE, Klier et al. (1998) show that all three isomers of DCE (i.e., 1,1-DCE, I-1,2-DCE, and trans-1,2- DCE) can be biodegraded in aerobic systems. In these experiments, it was observed that cis-1,2- DCE degraded more rapidly than the other isomers. Hartmans et al. (1985) and Hartmans and deBont (1992) show that vinyl chloride can be used as a primary substrate under aerobic conditions,with vinyl chloride apparently being directly mineralized to carbon dioxide and water. This has alsobeen reported by Davis and Carpenter (1990). Aerobic biodegradation is rapid relative to othermechanisms of vinyl chloride reductive to be aerobically mineral- ized/oxidized. Stucki et al. (1983) and Janssen et al. (1985) show that 1,2-DCA can be used as a primary substrate under aerobic conditions. In this case, the bacteria transform 1,2-DCA tochloroethanol, which is then mineralized to carbon dioxide. Evidence of oxidation of chloroethaneis scant, however, it appears to rapidly degrade via abiotic mechanisms (hydrolysis) and is thus lesslikely to Oxidation of Chlorobenzenes Chlorobenzene and polychlorinated benzenes (up to and including tetrachlorobenzene) have been shown to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions. Several studies have shown that bacteriaare able to utilize (de Bont et al., 1986), 1,2-DCB (Haigler et al., 1988), 1,2,4-TCB (van der Meer et al., 1987; Sander et al., 1991), and 1,2,4,5-TeCB (Sander et al., 1991) as primary growth substrates in aerobic systems. Nishino et al. (1994) note that aerobic bacteria able to grow on chlorobenzene have been detected at a variety ofchlorobenzene-contaminated sites, but not at uncontaminated sites. Spain (1996) notes that thisprovides strong evidence that the bacteria are selected for their ability to derive carbon and energyfrom chlorobenzene degradation in situ. The pathways for all of these reactions are similar, and are also similar to that of benzene (Chapelle, 1993; Spain, 1996). In general, the aerobic biodegradation involves hydroxylation of thechlorinated benzene to a chlorocatechol, followed by ortho cleavage of the benzene ring. This produces a muconic acid, which is dechlorinated, and the non-chlorinated intermediates are thenmetabolized. The only significant difference between this process and aerobic benzene degradationis the elimination of chlorine at some point in the pathway (Chapelle, 1993). B.3.2.2 Anaerobic Biodegradation of Primary Substrates Rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen caused by microbial respiration results in the establish- ment of anaerobic conditions in areas with high organic carbon concentrations. Certain requirementsmust be met in order for anaerobic (anoxic) bacteria to degrade organic compounds, including:absence of dissolved oxygen; availability of carbon sources (natural or anthropogenic), electronacceptors, and essential nutrients; and proper ranges of pH, temperature, salinity, and redox potential.When oxygen is absent, nitrate, manganese (IV), iron (III), sulfate, and carbon dioxide can serve asterminal electron acceptors during oxidation of organic carbon. While there is a large body ofevidence for anaerobic mineralization (oxidation) of fuel hydrocarbons, there is such transformations involving chlorinated compounds. B.3.2.2.1 Anaerobic Oxidation of Hydrocarbons Biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons will occur under anaerobic conditions in most, if not all, ground-water environments via denitrification, manganese (IV) reduction, iron (III) reduction, sulfatereduction, and methanogenesis. Biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons is discussed by Wiedemeier et al. (1995a), and many primary references are cited therein. B.3.2.2.2 Anaerobic Oxidation of Chlorinated Ethenes In general, due to the oxidized nature of polychlorinated ethenes, they are unlikely to undergo oxidation in groundwater systems. However, Bradley and Chapelle (1996) show that vinyl chloride(with only one chlorine substituent) can be directly oxidized to carbon dioxide and water viairon (III) reduction. Reduction of vinyl chloride concentrations in microcosms amended with iron(III)-EDTA closely matched the production of carbon dioxide. Slight mineralization was also notedin unamended microcosms. The rate of this reaction apparently depends on the bioavailability of theiron (III). At this time, it is not known if other workers have demonstrated other anaerobic mineral-ization evidence of anaerobic oxidation of chlorinated ethanes was found; this does not necessarily indicate that such reactions have not been described. However,the lack of discussion of such transformations in surveys of chlorinated hydrocarbon biodegradation(e.g., Vogel et al., Adriaens and Vogel, 1995;Spain, 1996) suggests that there has indeed been little, if any, work on this subject.B3-37B.3.2.2.4 Anaerobic Oxidation of Chlorobenzenes While aerobic mineralization of chlorobenzenes is similar to that of benzene, similar activity under anaerobic conditions has not been documented. As discussed above, there is little, if any,discussion of this topic in the literature. B.3.3 BIODEGRADATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS VIA USE AS AN ELECTRON ACCEPTOR (REDUCTIVE DECHLORINATION) Bouwer et al. (1981) were the first to show that halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons could be biologically transformed under anaerobic conditions in the subsurface environment. Since that time,numerous investigators have shown that chlorinated compounds can degrade via reductive dechlori-nation under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobically, biodegradation of oftenproceeds through a process called reductive dechlorination. During this process, the halogenatedhydrocarbon is used as an electron acceptor, not as a source of carbon, and a halogen atom is re-moved and replaced with a hydrogen atom. As an example, Dehalobacter restrictus was shown by Holliger et al., (1993) to use tetrachloroethene as an electron acceptor during reductive dechlorina- tion to produce cis-1,2-dichloroethene. Because as electron accep- tors during reductive dechlorination, there must be an appropriate source of carbon for microbialgrowth in order for reductive dehalogenation to occur (Baek and 1989; Freedman and Gossett,1989; Fathepure and Boyd, 1988; Bouwer, 1994). Potential carbon sources can include low molecu-lar weight organic compounds (lactate, acetate, methanol, glucose, etc.), fuel hydrocarbons,byproducts of fuel degradation (e.g., volatile fatty acids), or naturally occurring organic matter. In some situations, reductive dechlorination may be a cometabolic process, in that the reaction is incidental to normal metabolic functions and the organisms derive no benefit from the reaction.Such cometabolism typically results in slow, incomplete dechlorination (Gantzer and Wackett, 1991;Gossett and Zinder, 1996). More important, recent studies are discovering direct dechlorinators(typically isolated from contaminated subsurface environments or treatment systems) that use chlori-nated ethenes as electron acceptors in reactions that provide growth and energy (e.g., Holliger et al., 1992; Holliger et al., 1993; Holliger and Schumacher, 1994; and McCarty, 1996; Gerritse et al., 1996). This process has been termed both halorespiration and dehalorespiration . Biotic transformations of chlorinated solvents under conditions are reduc- tions that involve either hydrogenolysis or dihaloelimination (McCarty and Semprini, 1994).Hydrogenolysis occurs when a chlorine atom is replaced with hydrogen. Dihaloelimination occurswhen two adjacent chlorine atoms are removed and a double bond is formed between the respectivecarbon atoms. The most important process for the natural biodegradation of the more highly chlori-nated solvents is reductive dechlorination (hydrogenolysis). Higher ratios of chlorine to carbon represent higher oxidation levels; highly chlorinated com- pounds are more oxidized than lesser chlorinated compounds and thus are less susceptible to oxida-tion. Thus, highly chlorinated compounds such as PCE, TCE, TCA, or HCB are more likely toundergo reductive than oxidative reactions. During these reductive reactions, electrons aretransferred to the chlorinated compound, and a chlorine atom is replaced with a hydrogen atom. Asan example, consider the reductive dechlorination of PCE to TCE and then TCE to DCE, and finallyDCE to vinyl chloride. Because of the relatively low oxidation state of VC, this compound morecommonly undergoes aerobic biodegradation as a primary substrate than reductive dechlorination. Reductive dechlorination processes result in the formation of intermediates which are more reduced than the parent compound. These intermediates are often more susceptible to oxidativebacterial metabolism than to further reductive anaerobic processes. Actual mechanisms of reductivedehalogenation are still unclear, and in some cases may be a form of cometabolism (Gantzer andWackett, 1991; Adriaens and Vogel, addition, other factors that will influ-B3-38ence the process include the type of electron donor and the presence of competing electron acceptors (Adriaens and Vogel, 1995; Suflita and Townsend, 1995), temperature, and substrate availability. Recent evidence suggests that dechlorination is dependent upon the supply of hydrogen (H2), which acts as the electron donor in many such reactions (Gossett and Zinder, 1996; Smatlak et al., 1996). The hydrogen is produced as a result of the microbial degradation of a primary substrate(e.g., lactate, acetate, butyrate, ethanol, BTEX, or other such compounds). Bacteria that facilitatedechlorination compete with sulfate-reducers and methanogens for the H 2 produced in such a system. When degradation of the original substrate/electron donor rapidly yields high concentrations of H2, the sulfate-reducers and methanogens appear to be favored over the dechlorinators. Conversely,when substrate degradation produces a steady supply of H 2 at low concentrations, the dechlorinators are favored (Gossett and Zinder, 1996; Smatlak et al., 1996). Complete dechlorination is thus apparently favored when a steady, low-concentration supply of H2 is produced through microbial degradation of substrates such as proprionate or benzoate (and, by extension from benzoate, theBTEX compounds) (Gossett and Zinder, 1996). Therefore, the type of substrate/electron donor canalso play a role in how thoroughly a natural system is able to dechlorinate solvents. One or more of the following generally is observed at a site where reductive dechlorination of alkenes is ongoing: 1) Ethene is being produced (even low concentrations are indicative of biodegradation);2) Methane is being produced;3) Iron II is being produced;4) Hydrogen concentrations are between 1-4 nM; and5) Dissolved Chlorinated Ethenes to undergo reductive dechlorination in a variety of anaerobic systems from different environments, with various electron donors/carbon sources (Table B.3.4)(Wilson, 1988; Sewell et al., 1991; Roberts et al., 1982). This is particularly true if the subsurfacealso contains other anthropogenic or native organic compounds that can serve as electron donors andwhose utilization by subsurface bacteria will deplete any available oxygen. In general, reductivedechlorination of chlorinated ethenes occurs DCEto VC to ethene. Depending upon environmental conditions, this sequence may be interrupted, withother processes then acting upon the products. With sufficient quantities or appropriate types ofelectron donors (e.g., slow but steady H 2-production), the final end-product of anaerobic reductive 1989). Reductive dehalogenation of chlori-nated solvent compounds is associated with the accumulation of daughter products and an increasein chloride. Studies have shown that PCE and TCE can anaerobically reduced to either 1,1-DCE, cis-1,2- DCE, or trans-1,2-DCE, all of which can be further transformed to vinyl chloride (Miller and Guengerich, 1982; Wilson and Wilson, 1985; Mayer et al., 1988; Nelson, et al., 1986; Henson et al., 1989; Tsien et al., 1989; Henry, 1991; McCarty, 1994; Wilson et al., 1994). During reductive dehalogenation, all three isomers of DCE can theoretically be produced; however, Bouwer (1994)reports that cis-1,2-DCE is a more common intermediate than trans-1,2-DCE and that 1,1-DCE is the least prevalent intermediate of the three DCE isomers. Vinyl chloride produced fromdehalogenation of DCE may be subsequently reduced to innocuous products such as ethane orcarbon dioxide. The removal of vinyl chloride occurs more readily under aerobic conditions, such asthose encountered at the edge of the plume. Vinyl chloride may also be used as a primary substrateby aerobic organisms, as previously discussed.B3-39Table B.3.4 Sources, Donors, Acceptors, and Products of Reductive Dechlorinating Systems Reference Source Acceptor-Product Bouwer & Digester Organic Material PCE-TCE 1985 Bioreactor Acetate PCE-VC, CO 2 Kleopfer et al., 1985 Soil Soybean Meal TCE-DCE Barrio-Lage et al., 1987 Swamp Muck SoilOrganic Material Fathepure et also undergo reductive dehalogenation in the subsurface via use as electron acceptors. Dechlorination of TCA has been described by Vogel andMcCarty (1987) and Cox et al. (1995), but this pathway is complicated by the abiotic reactions that can affect TCA and its byproducts (Vogel, 1994). B.3.3.3 Reductive Dechlorination of well as trichlorobenzene), reductive dechlorination is the most likely biodegrada-tion (Holliger al., 1992; Ramanand et al., 1993; Suflita and Townsend, by Suflita and Townsend (1995), reductive dehalogenation of aromatic compounds hasbeen observed in a variety of anaerobic habitats, including aquifer materials, marine and freshwatersediments, sewage sludges, and soil samples; however, isolation of specific microbes capable ofthese reactions has been difficult. As with the chlorinated ethenes and ethanes, the chlorobenzenesare most likely acting as electron acceptors as other sources of carbon and energy are being utilizedby microbes or microbial consortia (Suflita and Townsend, 1995). Evidence has been presentedsuggesting that oxidation of hydrogen using halogenated aromatics as electron acceptors may yieldmore energy than if more commonly available electron acceptors were used (Dolfing and Harrison,1992). As discussed previously, the actual mechanisms of reductive dehalogenation are not well under- stood. Further, reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated benzenes has not as chlorinated solvents. However, reductive dechlorination of chlorobenzenes has beendocumented more frequently in the past several years (e.g., Bosma et al., 1988; Fathepure et al., 1991; Holliger et al., 1992; Ramanand et al., 1993). As with other chlorinated solvents, the reductive dehalogenation of chlorobenzenes is affected by the degree ofchlorination of the compound. The more chlorinated aromatic compounds are typically more ame-nable to this reaction (Suflita and Townsend, 1995; Adriaens and Vogel, 1995), but as they aredechlorinated, the daughter products will become more resistant to further dehalogenation reactions(Fathepure et al., 1988; Bosma et al., 1988; Holliger et al., 1992). The reductive dechlorination of chlorobenzenes is analogous to reactions involving chlorinated ethenes and ethanes in that suchdegradation will make them more amenable to aerobic biodegradation (Schraa, et al., 1986; Spain and Nishino, 1987; Ramanand al., 1993). B.3.4 BIODEGRADATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS VIA COMETABOLISM When a chlorinated solvent is biodegraded through cometabolism, it serves as neither an elec- tron acceptor nor a primary substrate in a biologically mediated redox reaction. Instead, the degrada-tion of the compound is catalyzed by an enzyme cofactor that is fortuitously produced by organismsfor other purposes. The best-documented cometabolism reactions involve catabolic oxygenases thatcatalyze the initial step in oxidation of their respective primary or growth substrate (BTEX or otherorganic compounds). These oxygenases are typically nonspecific and, therefore, fortuitously initiateoxidation of a variety of compounds, including many of the CAHs (McCarty and Semprini, 1994).The organism receives no known benefit from the degradation of the chlorinated solvent; in somecases the cometabolic degradation of the solvent may, in fact, be harmful to the microorganismresponsible for the production of the enzyme or cofactor (McCarty and Semprini, 1994). Chlorinatedsolvents are usually only partially transformed during cometabolic processes, with additional bioticor abiotic degradation generally required to complete the transformation (McCarty and Semprini,1994). Cometabolism is best documented for CAHs in aerobic environments; evidence of cometabolism of chlorobenzenes is scant, as is clear evidence of anaerobic cometabolism. In anB3-41aerobic environment, many chlorinated organic compounds can only be degraded via cometabolism. It has been reported that under aerobic conditions chlorinated ethenes, with the exception of PCE,are susceptible to further elaborates that the oxidationrate increases as the degree of chlorination decreases. Aerobic cometabolism of ethenes may becharacterized by a loss of contaminant mass, the presence of intermediate degradation products (e.g.,chlorinated oxides, aldehydes, ethanols, and epoxides), and the presence of other products such aschloride, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and a variety of organic acids (Miller and Guengerich,1982; McCarty and Semprini, 1994). The lack of clear evidence for anaerobic cometabolism does not necessarily imply that such transformations do not occur; in some cases, reductive dechlorination may be a result ofcometabolism (e.g., Gantzer and Wackett, 1991), depending upon the relationship between themicrobes, substrates, contaminants, and other electron acceptors. However, as with aerobiccometabolism, anaerobic cometabolism will be slow relative to dehalorespiration and might not bedistinguishable at the field scale (Gossett and Zinder, 1996). Several groups of aerobic bacteria currently are recognized as being capable of transforming TCE and other CAHs via cometabolism; these groups include: Methane Oxidizers (Methanotrophs) (Fogel et al., 1986; Little et al., 1988, Mayer et al., 1988; Oldenhuis et al., 1989; Tsien et al., 1986, 1988; Wackett and Gibson, 1988; Folsom et al., 1990; Harker Kim, 1990); Ammonia de Bont, 1992). These bacteria all have catabolic oxygenases that catalyze the initial step in oxidation of their respective primary or growth substrates and have the potential for initiating the oxidation of CAHs. Cometabolism is not nearly as important a degradation mechanism for chlorinated solvents in the saturated zone as reductive dehalogenation. Due to the need for a substrate that may be presentin limited concentrations, as well as the fortuitous nature of the reactions, rates of cometabolism areoften slow enough that this process may not be detectable unless the system is stimulated withadditional substrate mass. For a discussion of this topic, see McCarty and Semprini (1994) orWackett (1995). B.3.5 THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS Electron transfer results in oxidation of the electron donor and reduction of the electron accep- tor and the production of usable energy. The energy produced by these reactions is quantified by theGibbs free energy of the reaction (G r) which is given by: GG Gr f products Where: Gr = Gibbs Free Energy of the Reaction at Standard State Gfp r o d u c t s, = Gibbs Free Energy of Formation for Products at Standard State Gf reactants, = Gibbs Free Energy of Formation for the Reactants at Standard StateB3-42The Gr defines the maximum useful energy change for a chemical reaction at a constant tem- perature and pressure. Table B.3.5 presents select electron acceptor and electron donor half-cellreactions and the calculated G r values. Table B.3.6 gives the Gibbs free energy of formation (Gf) for species used in these half-cell reactions. Table B.3.7 presents coupled oxidation-reduction reactions.In general, those reactions that yield the most energy tend to take precedence over less energy-yielding reactions. However, the calculated energy yield of processes involving anthropogenicorganic compounds may not be reflected in the true energy yield of the metabolic process.Figure B.3.4 illustrates the expected sequence of microbially mediated redox reactions based on G r. There is sufficient energy in the reaction of fuel hydrocarbons with chlorinated solvents to allowtheir use by microorganisms as physiological electron acceptors.B3-43Table B.3.5 (REDUCTION) HALF CELL REACTIONS 5e- Reduction-18.9 +0.819 * = G\u00b0r for half-cell reaction as shown divided by the number of electrons involved in reaction. \u00a7 = Conditions assumed for the calculation of Eh and pe (pe = Eh/0.05916).

They are not appropriate under denitrifying conditions.-136 MethanogenesisNatural Electron Gibbs free of reaction.B4-60SECTION B-4 DESTRUCTIVE ATTENUATION MECHANISMS - ABIOTIC Chlorinated solvents dissolved in ground water may also be degraded by abiotic mechanisms, although the reactions are typically not complete and often result in the formation of an intermediatethat may be at least as toxic as the original contaminant. The most common reactions affectingchlorinated compounds are hydrolysis (a substitution reaction) and dehydrohalogenation (an elimina-tion reaction). Other possible reactions include oxidation and reduction reactions. Butler and Barker(1996) note that no abiotic oxidation reactions involving typical halogenated solvents have beenreported in the literature. They also note that reduction reactions (which include hydrogenolysis anddihaloelimination) are commonly microbially mediated, although some abiotic reduction reactionshave been observed. As Butler and Barker (1996) note, attributing changes in either the presence or absence of halogenated solvents or the concentrations of halogenated solvents to abiotic processes is usuallydifficult. For example, microbial activity is generally required to produce reducing conditions thatfavor reductive dehalogenation. If such activity is taking place, chlorinated solvents may be under-going both biotic and abiotic degradation, and discerning the relative contribution of each mecha-nism on the field scale, if possible, would be very difficult. As another example, Butler and Barker(1996) note that to substantiate that hydrolysis is occurring, the presence of non-halogenated break-down products such as acids and alcohols should be established. In general, these products are moreeasily biodegraded than their parent compounds and can be difficult to detect. Field evidence of thisnature has yet to be collected to demonstrate hydrolysis of halogenated solvents (Butler and Barker,1996). Given the difficulties of demonstrating abiotic degradation on the field scale, it may not be practical to demonstrate that such processes are occurring and to quantitatively evaluate the contribu-tions of those reactions (i.e., separately from biotic processes). If biodegradation is occurring at asite, the loss of contaminant mass due to that process may dwarf the mass lost to abiotic reactions,ruling out a cost-effective evaluation of abiotic degradation. However, while the rates of abioticdegradation may be slow relative to biotic mechanisms, the contribution of these mechanisms maystill play a significant role in natural attenuation, depending on site conditions (e.g., a site with aslow solute transport velocity or a long distance to the nearest receptor). Vogel (1994) describes datapatterns that may result from varying combinations of biotic and abiotic degradation of chlorinatedsolvents. Moreover, because some of the by-products of these reactions are chlorinated compoundsthat may be more easily or less easily degraded than the parent, the contributions of abiotic mecha-nisms may need to be considered when evaluating analytical data from a site. B.4.1 HYDROLYSIS AND DEHYDROHALOGENATION As discussed by Butler and Barker (1996), hydrolysis and dehydrohalogenation reactions are the most thoroughly studied abiotic attenuation mechanisms. In general, the rates of these reactions areoften quite slow within the range of normal ground-water temperatures, with half-lives of days tocenturies (Vogel et al., 1987; Vogel, 1994). Therefore, most information about the rates of these reactions is extrapolated from experiments run at higher temperatures so that the experiments couldbe performed within a practical time frame. B.4.1.1 Hydrolysis Hydrolysis is a substitution reaction in which an organic molecule reacts with water or a com- ponent ion of water, and a halogen substituent is replaced with a hydroxyl (OH -) group. The hy- droxyl substitution typically occurs at the halogenated carbon. This leads initially to the productionof alcohols. If the alcohols are halogenated, additional hydrolysis to acids or diols may occur. Also,B4-61the addition of a hydroxyl group to a parent molecule may make the daughter product more suscep- tible to biodegradation, as well as more soluble (Neely, 1985). Non-alcohol products have also beenreported by Vogel et al. (1987) and Jeffers et al. (1989), but they are apparently products of compet- ing dehydrohalogenation reactions. The likelihood that a halogenated solvent will undergo hydrolysis depends in part on the num- ber of halogen substituents. More halogen substituents on a compound will decrease the chance forhydrolysis reactions to occur (Vogel et al., 1987), and will therefore decrease the rate of the reaction. In addition, bromine substituents are more susceptible to hydrolysis than chlorine substituents (Vogelet al., 1987). 1,2-Dibromoethane is one compound that is subject to significant hydrolysis reactions under natural conditions. Locations of the halogen substituent on the carbon chain may also havesome effect on the rate of reaction. The rate also may increase with increasing pH; however, a ratedependence upon pH is typically not observed below a pH of 11 (Mabey and Mill, 1978; Vogel andReinhard, 1986). Rates of hydrolysis may also be increased by the presence of clays, which can actas catalysts (Vogel et al., 1987). Hydrolysis rates can generally be described using first-order kinet- ics, particularly in solutions in which water is the dominant nucleophile (Vogel et al., 1987). How- ever, this oversimplifies what is typically a much more complicated relationship (Neely, 1985). Asnoted in the introduction to this Appendix, reported rates of environmentally significant hydrolysisreactions involving chlorinated solvents are typically the result of extrapolation from experimentsperformed at higher temperatures (Mabey and of chlorinated ethanes has in literature. Vogel (1994) reports that monohalogenated alkanes have half-lives on the order of days to months,while polychlorinated methanes and ethanes have half-lives that may range up to thousands of yearsfor carbon tetrachloride. As the number of chlorine atoms increases, dehydrohalogenation maybecome more important (Jeffers et al., 1989). Butler and Barker (1996) note that chlorinated ethenes do not undergo significant hydrolysis reactions (i.e., the rates are slow). Butler and Barker alsoreported that they were unable to find any studies on hydrolysis of vinyl chloride. A listing of half-lives for abiotic hydrolysis and dehydrohalogenation of some chlorinated solvents is presented onTable B.4.1. Note that no distinctions are made in the table as to which mechanism is operating; thisis consistent with the references from which the table has been derived (Vogel et al., 1987; Butler and Barker, 1996). One common chlorinated solvent for which abiotic transformations have been well-studied is 1,1,1-TCA. 1,1,1-TCA may be abiotically transformed to acetic acid through a series of substitutionreactions, including hydrolysis. In addition, 1,1,1-TCA may be reductively dehalogenated to form1,1- DCA) and then chloroethane (CA), which then hydrolyzed to ethanol (Vogel and McCarty,1987) or dehydrohalogenated to vinyl chloride (Jeffers et al., 1989). Rates of these reactions have been studied by several parties, and these rates are summarized in Table B.4.1. B.4.1.2 Dehydrohalogenation Dehydrohalogenation is an elimination reaction involving halogenated alkanes in which a halogen is removed from one carbon atom, followed by the subsequent removal of a hydrogen atomfrom an adjacent carbon atom. In this two-step reaction, an alkene is produced. Although theoxidation state of the compound decreases due to the removal of a halogen, the loss of a hydrogenatom increases it. This results in no external electron transfer, and there is no net change in theoxidation state of the reacting molecule (Vogel et al., 1987). Contrary to the patterns observed for hydrolysis, the likelihood that dehydrohalogenation will occur increases with the number of halogensubstituents. It has been suggested that under normal environmental conditions, monohalogenatedaliphatics apparently do not undergo dehydrohalogenation, and these reactions are apparently notlikely to occur (March, 1985; Vogel et al., 1987). However, Jeffers et al. (1989) report on theB4-62dehydrohalogenation of CA to VC. Polychlorinated alkanes have been observed to undergo dehydrohalogenation under normal conditions and extremely basic conditions (Vogel et al., 1987). As with hydrolysis, bromine substituents are more reactive with Half-Lives Hydrolysis Trichloroethene 0.7f *, 1.3 x 106 b 1,1-Dichloroethene 1.2 x 108 b 1,2-Dichloroethene 2.1 x 1010 b aFrom Mabey and Mill, 1978 bFrom Jeffers 1989 cFrom Vogel et al., 1987 dFrom Vogel and McCarty, 1987 eFrom Cooper et al., 1987 fFrom Dilling et al., 1975 * Butler and Barker (1996) indicate that these values may reflect experimental difficulties and that the longer half-life [as calculated by Jeffers et al. (1989)] should be used. Dehydrohalogenation rates may also be approximated using pseudo-first-order kinetics. Once again, this is not truly a first-order reaction, but such approximations have been used in the literatureto quantify the reaction rates. The rates will not only depend upon the number and types of halogensubstituent, but also on the hydroxide ion concentration. Under normal pH conditions (i.e., near aB4-63pH of 7), interaction with water (acting as a weak base) may become more important (Vogel et al., 1987). Transformation rates for dehydrohalogenation reactions is presented in Table B.4.1. 1,1,1-TCA is also known to undergo dehydrohalogenation (Vogel and McCarty, 1987). In this case, TCAis transformed to 1,1-DCE, which is then reductively dehalogenated The VC is then eitherreductively dehalogenated to ethene or consumed as a substrate in an aerobic reaction and convertedto CO 2. In a laboratory study, Vogel and McCarty (1987) reported that the abiotic conversion of 1,1,1-TCA to 1,1-DCE has a rate constant of about 0.04 year-1. It was noted that this result was longer than indicated in previous studies, but that experimental methods differed. Jeffers et al. (1989) reported on several other dehydrohalogenation reactions; in addition to 1,1,1-TCA and 1,1,2-TCA both degrading 1,1-DCE, the tetrachloroethanes and pentachloroethanes degrade to TCE andPCE, respectively. Rates of these reactions are included in Table B.4.1. As noted previously, Jefferset al. (1989) also report that CA may degrade to VC, but no information on rates was encountered during the literature search for this Appendix. B.4.2 REDUCTION REACTIONS Two abiotic reductive dechlorination reactions that operate in the subsurface are hydrogenolysis and dihaloelimination. Hydrogenolysis is the simple replacement of a chlorine (oranother halogen) by a hydrogen, while dihaloelimination is the removal of two chlorines (or otherhalogens) accompanied by the formation of a double carbon-carbon bond. Butler and Barker (1996)review work by Criddle et al. (1986), Jafvert and Wolfe (1987), Reinhard et al. (1990), and Acton (1990) and this review suggests that while these reactions are thermodynamically possible underreducing conditions, they often do not take place in the absence of biological activity, even if suchactivity is only indirectly responsible for the reaction. While not involved in a manner similar to thatfor cometabolism, microbes may produce reductants that facilitate such reactions in conjunction withminerals in the aquifer matrix, as has been suggested by work utilizing aquifer material from theBorden test site (Reinhard et al., 1990). Moreover, the reducing conditions necessary to produce such reactions are most often created as a result of microbial activity. It is therefore not clear if someof these reactions are truly abiotic, or if because of their reliance on microbial activity to producereducing conditions or reactants, they should be considered to be a form of cometabolism. In some cases, truly abiotic reductive dechlorination has been observed; however, the conditions that favor such reactions may not occur naturally. For example, Gillham and O'Hannesin (1994)describe reductive dehalogenation iron, in which the ironserves as an electron donor in an electrochemical reaction. However, this is not a natural process.Wang and Tan (1990) reported reduction of TCE to ethene and carbon tetrachloride to methaneduring a platinum-catalyzed reaction between elemental magnesium and water. Given that themetals involved in these reactions are unlikely to occur naturally in the reduced forms used in theaforementioned work, such processes are not likely to contribute to natural attenuation of chlorinatedsolvents.B4-64C1-1APPENDIX C DATA INTERPRETATION and CALCULATIONSC1-2TABLE OF CONTENTS - APPENDIX C C-1 INTRODUCTION

site-specific data to define the ground-water flow system, refine the conceptual model, quantify rates of contaminantattenuation, and model the fate and transport of dissolved contaminants. Tasks to be completedinclude preparation of lithologic logs, hydrogeologic sections, potentiometric surface acceptor and calculation of hydraulic parameters, retardation coefficients, and biodegradation rateconstants. The rate and amount of partitioning of organic compounds from mobile and residualnonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL) into ground water should also be determined to allow estimationof a source term. Completion of these tasks permits refinement of the conceptual model and isnecessary to successfully support remediation by natural attenuation. This appendix consists of three sections, including this introduction. Section C-2 discusses preparation of geologic boring logs, hydrogeologic sections, and maps. Section C-3 covers naturalattenuation calculations, including hydraulic parameter calculations, contaminant source termcalculations, confirming quantifying biodegradation, implementing, microcosm studies.C2-6SECTION C-2 PREPARATION OF GEOLOGIC BORING LOGS, HYDROGEOLOGIC SECTIONS, AND MAPS The first step after completion of site characterization field activities is to prepare geologic boring logs, hydrogeologic sections, water table elevation (or potentiometric surface) maps, flownets, and maps depicting contaminant concentrations, electron acceptor and metabolic byproductconcentrations, and mobile NAPL thickness. The construction of these items is discussed in thefollowing sections. C.2.1 PREPARATION OF LITHOLOGIC LOGS Lithologic logs should be prepared using field data. Whenever possible, these logs should contain descriptions of the aquifer matrix, including relative density, color, major textural constitu-ents, minor constituents, porosity, relative moisture content, plasticity of fines, cohesiveness, grainsize, structure or stratification, relative permeability, and any significant observations such as visiblefuel or fuel odor. It is also important to correlate the results of volatile organic compound (VOC)screening using headspace vapor analysis with depth intervals of geologic materials. The depth oflithologic contacts and/or significant textural changes should be recorded to the nearest 0.1 foot.This resolution is necessary because preferential flow and contaminant transport pathways may belimited to stratigraphic units less than 6 inches thick. C.2.2 PREPARATION OF HYDROGEOLOGIC SECTIONS Lithologic logs should be used in conjunction with water level data to prepare a minimum of two hydrogeologic sections for the site. One section should be oriented parallel to the direction ofground-water flow, and one section should be oriented perpendicular to the direction of ground-waterflow. Both sections should be drawn to scale. Hydrogeologic sections are an integral part of theconceptual model and are useful in identifying preferential contaminant migration pathways and inmodeling the site. At a minimum, hydrogeologic sections should contain information on the relationships between hydrostratigraphic units at the site, including the location and distribution of transmissive vs. non- transmissive units, the location of the water table relative to these units, and the location(s) of thecontaminant source(s). Figure C.2.1 is an example of a completed hydrogeologic section.

If a plan view (potentiometric surface, or water table elevation, map) or atwo-dimensional cross-section is drawn to represent a flow system, the resultant equipotential linesand flow lines constitute a flow net. A flow net can be used to determine the distribution of hydrau-lic head, the ground-water velocity distribution, ground-water and solute flow paths and flow rates,and the general flow pattern in a ground-water system. C.2.3.1 Review of Topographic Maps Ground-water flow is strongly influenced by the locations of ground-water divides and by recharge from and discharge to surface water bodies such as rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands.Topographic highs generally represent divergent flow boundaries (divergent ground-water divide),and topographic lows such as valleys or drainage basins typically represent convergent flow bound-aries (convergent ground-water divide). In addition, the configuration of the water table is typically asubtle reflection of the surface topography in the area. However, topography is not always indicativeof subsurface flow patterns and should not be depended upon unless confirmed by head data. Inorder to place the local hydrogeologic flow system within the context of the regional hydrogeologicflow system, it is important to have an understanding of the local and regional topography. Includedin this must be knowledge of the locations of natural and manmade surface water bodies. Thisinformation can generally be gained from topographic maps published by the United States Geologi-cal Survey. C.2.3.2 Preparation of Potentiometric Surface Maps A potentiometric surface map is a two-dimensional graphical representation of equipotential lines shown in plan view. Water table elevation maps are potentiometric surface maps drawn forwater table (unconfined) aquifers. Potentiometric surface maps for water table aquifers show whereplanes of equal potential intersect the water table. A potentiometric surface map should be preparedfrom water level measurements and surveyor's data. These maps are used to estimate the directionof plume migration and to calculate hydraulic gradients. To document seasonal variations in ground-water flow, separate potentiometric surface maps should be prepared using quarterly water levelmeasurements taken over a period of at least 1 year. The data used to develop the potentiometric surface map should be water level elevation data (elevation relative to mean sea level) from piezometers/wells screened in the same relative positionwithin the same hydrogeologic unit. For example, wells that are screened at the water table can beused for the same potentiometric surface map. Wells screened in different hydrogeologic units or atdifferent relative positions within the same water table aquifer cannot be used to prepare a potentio-metric surface map. Where possible, a potentiometric surface map should be prepared for eachhydrogeologic unit at the site. In recharge areas, wells screened at various elevations cannot all beused to prepare the same potentiometric surface map because of strong downward vertical gradients.Likewise, wells screened at various elevations in discharge areas such as near streams, lakes, orsprings, should not all be used because of the strong upward vertical gradients. When preparing a potentiometric surface map, the locations of system boundaries should be kept in mind; particularly the site features that tend to offset the shape of the contours on the map.Such features include topographic divides, surface water bodies, and pumping wells. In addition to, and separately from, preparation of a potentiometric surface map, water level measurements from wells screened at different depths can be used to determine any vertical hydrau-C2-8lic gradients. It is important to have a good understanding of vertical hydraulic gradients because they may have a profound influence on contaminant migration. In areas with measurable mobile LNAPL, a correction must be made for the water table deflec- tion caused by the LNAPL. The following relationship, based on Archimedes' Principle, provides acorrection factor that allows the water table elevation to be adjusted for the effect water [L] lnapl= density of the LNAPL [M/L3] w= density of water, generally 1.0 [M/L3] PT= measured LNAPL thickness [L] Using the corrected depth to water, the corrected ground-water elevation, CGWE, is given by: CGWE CDTW=DatumElevation ground-water elevations should be used for potentiometric surface map preparation.

Figure C.2.2 Example ground-water elevation map.C2-9C.2.3.3 Preparation of Flow Nets Where an adequate three-dimensional database is available, flow nets can be constructed to facilitate the interpretation of the total hydraulic head distribution in the aquifer. This will helpdetermine potential solute migration pathways. The simplest ground-water flow system is one that ishomogeneous and isotropic. This type of hydrogeologic setting serves as a simple basis for describ-ing the basic rules of flow net construction, despite the fact that homogeneous, isotropic media rarelyoccur in nature. Regardless of the type of geologic media, the basic rules of flow net constructionmust be applied, and necessary modifications must be made throughout the procedure to account foraquifer heterogeneity or anisotropic conditions. Water level data for flow net construction shouldcome from multiple sets of nested wells (two or more wells at the same location) at various depths inthe aquifer. The fundamental rules of flow net construction and the important properties of flow netsare summarized as follows: Flow lines and equipotential lines intersect at 90-degree angles if the permeability is isotropic; The geometric figures formed by the intersection of flow lines and equipotential lines must approximate squares or rectangles; Equipotential lines must meet impermeable boundaries at right angles (impermeable boundaries are flow lines); and Equipotential lines must be parallel to constant-head boundaries (constant-head bound- aries are equipotential lines). Trial-and-error sketching is generally used to construct a flow net. Flow net sketching can be sufficiently accurate if constructed according to the basic rules outlined above. A relatively smallnumber of flow lines (three to five) generally are sufficient to adequately characterize flow condi-tions. Flow nets should be superimposed on the hydrogeologic sections. Figure C.2.3 is an exampleof a completed flow net. This figure shows ground-water flow patterns in both recharge and dis-charge areas. C.2.3.4 Preparation of Contaminant Isopach Maps If NAPL is present at the site, isopach maps showing the thickness and distribution of NAPL should be prepared. Two maps should be prepared: one for mobile NAPL, and one for residualNAPL. Such isopach maps allow estimation of the distribution of NAPL in the subsurface and aid in Figure C.2.3 Example flow net.Water TableDivergent Groundwater Divide Convergent Groundwater Divide 10 9 8 75 6 765 Modified from Hubbert (1940) Flow Line Total Head (meters)10Equipotential LineC2-10fate and transport model development by identifying the boundary of the NAPL. Because of the differences between the magnitude of capillary suction in the aquifer matrix and the different surfacetension properties of fuel and water, LNAPL thickness observations made in monitoring points areonly an estimate of the actual volume of mobile LNAPL in the aquifer. To determine the actualNAPL thickness it is necessary to collect and visually analyze soil samples. LNAPL thickness dataalso should be used to correct for water table deflections caused by the mobile LNAPL. This processis described in Section C.2.2.3.2. Isopach maps are prepared by first plotting the measured NAPL thickness on a base map pre- pared using surveyor's data. Lines of equal NAPL thickness (isopachs) are then drawn and labeled.Each data point must be honored during contouring. Figure C.2.4 is an example of a completedisopach map. This figure also contains an example of an isopleth map. C.2.3.4.1 Relationship Between Apparent and Actual LNAPL Thickness It is well documented that LNAPL thickness measurements taken in ground-water monitoring wells are not indicative of actual LNAPL thicknesses in the formation (de Pastrovich et al., 1979; Blake and Hall, 1984; Hall et al., 1984; Hughes et al., 1988; Abdul et al., 1989; Testa and Paczkowski, 1989; Farr et al., 1990; Kemblowski and Chiang, and Parker, 1990; Mercer and Cohen, 1990; Ballestero et al., 1994; Huntley et al., 1994a). These authors note than the measured thickness of LNAPL in a monitoring well is greater than the true LNAPL thickness in theaquifer and, according Mercer and Cohen (1990), measured LNAPL thickness in wells is typically 2to 10 times greater than the actual LNAPL thickness in the formation. The difference between actualand measured LNAPL thickness occurs because mobile LNAPL floating on the water table flowsinto the well (if the top of well screen is above the base of the LNAPL) and depresses the watertable. Figure C.2.5 is a schematic that illustrates this relationship.

Empirical relationships relating measured LNAPL thickness to actual LNAPL thickness are presented below. Also presentedbelow are test methods that can be used to determine actual LNAPL thickness. There are no estab-lished methods for determining actual DNAPL volume based on measurements taken in monitoringwells. Figure C.2.5 Measured (apparent) versus actual LNAPL thickness.Actual of LNAPL Capillary Rise Zone of Rise Measured Water TableTop of Product Apparent LNAPL ThicknessWell Screen Free Liquid HydrocarbonsResidual HydrocarbonsLEGEND Source: Modified from de Pastrovich and others, 1972.LNAPL Fraction Greater Than Residual SaturationLNAPLFraction at or Below Residual Saturation C.2.3.4.2. Empirical Relationships There are several empirical methods available to estimate the actual thickness of mobile LNAPL in the subsurface based on LNAPL thicknesses measured in a ground-water monitoringwell. Such empirical relationships are, at best, approximations because many factors influence therelationship between measured and apparent LNAPL thickness (Mercer and Cohen, 1990): Capillary fringe height depends on grain size and is hysteretic with fluid level fluctuations. LNAPL can become trapped below the water table as the water table rises and falls. The thickness of LNAPL is ambiguous because the interval of soil containing mobile LNAPL is not 100-percent saturated with LNAPL. Some empirical methods for determining actual LNAPL thickness are described below. Method of de Pastrovich et al. (1979) Hampton and Miller (1988) conducted laboratory experiments to examine the relationship between the actual thickness of LNAPL in a formation, hf, and that measured in a monitoring well, hm. Based on their research, Hampton and Miller (1988) suggest using the following relationship (developed by de Pastrovich et al., 1979) to estimate hm= measured LNAPL thickness in well w= density of water (1.0 gm/cm3 for pure water) lnapl = density of LNAPL (See Table C.3.9) Method of Kemblowski and Chiang (1990) Another empirical relationship was proposed by Kemblowski and Chiang (1990) to estimate actual LNAPL thickness based on measured LNAPL thickness. This relationship is given by: equivalent thickness of LNAPL in the formation (volume of oil per unit area of aquifer, divided by porosity) Ho= measured LNAPL thickness in well hawc dr = capillary height of air-water interface assuming water is being displaced by oil (typical values are given in Table C.2.1) This method assumes equilibrium conditions, water drainage, and oil imbibition. Table C.2.1 Typical Values for hawc dr (Bear, 1972) Aquifer Matrix hawc dr (cm) hawc dr (ft) Coarse >6.56-13.12 Method of Lenhard and Parker (1990) Another empirical relationship was proposed by Lenhard and Parker (1990) to estimate actual LNAPL thickness based on measured LNAPL thickness. This relationship is given by: DH Ho= measured LNAPL thickness in well ro= specific gravity of LNAPL (density of oil/density of water) ao= aw aoAir-oil scaling factorC2-13ow= aw owOil-water factor uncontaminated Table C.2.2] interfacial tension between water and LNAPL (47.75dynes/cm @ 20oC) It is important to note that this method includes the capillary thickness of the hydrocarbon, and is,therefore, likely to be an overestimate. Table C.2.2 Surface Tensions for Various Compounds Compound Surface Tension @ 20oC (dyne/cm) test is applicable in areas where the hydrocarbon/water interface is below the potentiometric surface, and the recharge rate of hydrocarbon into the well is slow (Hughes et al., 1988). Baildown T est Procedure (from Hughes et al., 1988): 1) Gauge the well and calculate the corrected potentiometric surface elevation using equations C.2.1 and C.2.2. 2) Rapidly bail the hydrocarbon from the well.3) Gauge the well again, and if the thickness of the hydrocarbon is acceptable (0.1 to 1 foot), calculate the potentiometric surface elevation. The potentiometric surface elevation thuscalculated should be within 0.005 foot of the value calculated in step 1. If it is, then continueto step 4; if it is not, repeat steps 2 and 3. 4) Record the top of the LNAPL surface in the well as it recharges until the well is fully re- charged. 5) Plot the elevation of the top of LNAPL in the well vs. time since bailing ceased. 6) The true thickness of the mobile LNAPL layer (T f) is the distance from the inflection point to the top of the hydrocarbon under static conditions (Figure C.2.6). Thus, Tf is picked directly off the plot. Table C.2.3 is an example of the results of this procedure.C2-14Figure C.2.6 Type curve for LNAPL baildown test.

(1988) also present a recharge method that involves pumping the mobile LNAPL until steady-state conditions are achieved, and then letting the well fully recharge. C.2.3.5 Preparation of Contaminant and Daughter Product Isopleth Maps Isopleth maps should be prepared for all chlorinated solvents of concern and their daughter products and for total BTEX if present. For example, if trichloroethene and BTEX were released (asis typical for fire training areas), then maps of dissolved trichloroethene, dichloroethene, vinylchloride, ethene, and total BTEX concentrations should be prepared. Isopleth maps allow interpreta-tion of data on the distribution and the relative transport and degradation rates of contaminants in thesubsurface. In addition, contaminant isopleth maps allow contaminant concentrations to be griddedand used for input into a solute transport model. Isopleth maps are prepared by first plotting the concentration of the contaminant on a base map prepared using surveyor's data. Lines of equal contaminant concentration (isopleths) are then drawnC2-15and labeled. It is important to ensure that each data point is honored during contouring. Outliers should be displayed and qualified, if they are not contoured. Figures C.2.4, C.2.7, and C.2.8 containexamples of Dissolved contaminant concentrations are determined through ground-water sampling and laboratory analysis. From these data, isopleth maps for each of the contaminant compounds and fortotal dissolved contaminant should be made. Dissolved BTEX concentrations are transferred to thefate and transport model grid cells by overlaying the isopleth map onto the model grid. C.2.3.6 Preparation of Electron Donor, Inorganic Electron Acceptor, and Metabolic By- product Contour (Isopleth) Maps Isopleth maps should be prepared for any organic compound that can be used as an electron donor. Examples of such compounds include natural organic carbon, and petroleum hydrocarbons(and landfill leachate). These maps are used to provide visible evidence that biodegradation couldoccur or is occurring. Isopleth maps also should be prepared for dissolved oxygen, nitrate,manganese (II), iron (II), sulfate, methane, and chloride. These maps are used to provide visibleevidence that biodegradation is occurring. The electron acceptor and metabolic by-product isoplethmaps can be used to determine the relative importance of each of the terminal electron-acceptingprocesses (TEAPs). Isopleth maps are prepared by first plotting the concentration of the electron donor, electron acceptor, or metabolic by-product on a base map prepared using surveyor's data. Lines of equalconcentration (isopleths) are then drawn and labeled. It is important to ensure that each data point ishonored during contouring, unless some data are suspect. C.2.3.6.1 Inorganic Electron Acceptor Isopleth Maps Electron acceptor isopleth maps allow interpretation of data on the distribution of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate in the subsurface. Isopleth maps for these compounds provide a visualindication of the relationship between the contaminant plume and the electron acceptors and the Figure C.2.7 Example isopleth maps of contaminants and soluble electron acceptors.C2-16relative importance of each TEAP. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below background levels in areas with high organic carbon concentrations are indicative of aerobic respiration. Nitrate concen-trations below background in areas with high organic carbon concentrations are indicative of denitri-fication. Sulfate concentrations below background in areas with high organic carbon concentrationsare indicative of sulfate reduction. Figure C.2.7 gives examples of completed isopleth maps for dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate. This figure also contains isopleth maps for TCE and DCE and the total BTEX (electrondonor) isopleth map for the same period. Comparison of the total BTEX isopleth map and theelectron acceptor isopleth maps shows that there is a strong correlation between areas with elevatedorganic carbon and depleted electron acceptor concentrations. The strong correlation indicates thatthe electron acceptor demand exerted during the metabolism of BTEX has resulted in the depletionof soluble inorganic electron acceptors. These relationships provide strong evidence that biodegra-dation is occurring via the processes of aerobic respiration, denitrification, and sulfate reduction. Figure C.2.8 Example Metabolic by-product maps should prepared for manganese (II), iron (II), methane, and chloride. The manganese (II) map is prepared in lieu of an electron acceptor isopleth map formanganese (IV) because the amount of bioavailable amorphous or poorly crystalline manganese (IV)in an aquifer matrix is extremely hard to quantify. The iron (II) map is prepared in lieu of an electronacceptor isopleth map for iron (III) because the amount of bioavailable amorphous or poorly crystal-line iron (III) in an aquifer matrix is extremely hard to quantify. Iron (II) concentrations abovebackground levels in areas with BTEX contamination are indicative of anaerobic iron (III) reduction.Methane concentrations above background levels in areas with BTEX contamination are indicativeof methanogenesis, another anaerobic process. Biodegradation of chlorinated solvents tends toincrease the chloride concentration found in ground water. Thus, chloride concentrations inside thecontaminant plume generally increase to concentrations above background. This map will allowvisual interpretation of chloride data by showing the relationship between the contaminant plumeand chloride. During anaerobic biodegradation, the oxidation-reduction potential water islowered. Thus, the oxidation-reduction potential (or pE) inside the contaminant plume generallydecreases to levels below background. Figure C.2.8 gives examples of completed isopleth maps for iron (II), methane, chloride, and pE. This figure also contains the TCE, DCE and Vinyl Chloride isopleth maps, and total BTEX(electron donor) isopleth map for the same period. Comparison of the total BTEX isopleth map andthe metabolic by-product isopleth maps Figures C.2.7 and C.2.8 shows that thereis a strong correlation between areas with elevated organic carbon and elevated metabolic by-productconcentrations. These relationships provide strong evidence that biodegradation is occurring via theprocesses of iron (III) reduction, methanogenesis, and reductive dechlorination.C3-18 SECTION C-3 NATURAL ATTENUATION CALCULATIONS Several calculations using site-specific data must be made in order to document the occurrence of natural attenuation and successfully implement the natural attenuation alternative. The followingsections describe these calculations. C.3.1 CALCULATING HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS Hydraulic parameters necessary for adequate site characterization and model implementation include hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, hydraulic gradient, linear ground-water flow velocity,hydrodynamic dispersion, and retarded solute transport velocity. Calculations for these parametersare discussed in the following sections. C.3.1.1 Hydraulic Conductivity Hydraulic conductivity, K, is a measure of an aquifer's ability to transmit water and is perhaps the most important variable governing fluid flow in the subsurface. Hydraulic conductivity has theunits of length over time [L/T]. Observed values of hydraulic conductivity range over 12 orders ofmagnitude, from 3x10 -12 to 3 cm/sec (3x10-9 to (Figure C.3.1 and C.3.1 of hydraulic conductivity values.Modified from:C3-19general terms, the hydraulic conductivity for unconsolidated sediments tends to increase with in- creasing grain size and sorting. The velocity of ground water and dissolved contaminants is directlyrelated to the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated zone. Subsurface variations in hydraulic con-ductivity directly influence contaminant fate and transport by providing preferential pathways forcontaminant migration. The most common methods used to quantify hydraulic conductivity in thesubsurface are aquifer pumping tests and slug tests. The quantitative analysis of pumping and slugtest data is beyond the scope of this document. For information on the quantitative analysis of thesedata, the reader is referred to the works of Kruseman and de Ridder (1991) and Dawson and Istok(1991). Table C.3.1 Representative Values of Hydraulic Conductivity for Various Sediments and Rocks (From Domenico and Schwartz, 1990) Material Hydraulic (m/day)Hydraulic 2x10-3 sand - - 2x10-2 sand - - SEDIMENTARY ROCK Karstic 9x10-2 2x1031x10-4 2 - 2x10-8C3-20C.3.1.1.1 Hydraulic Conductivity from Pumping Tests Pumping tests generally provide the most reliable information about aquifer hydraulic conduc- tivity. Pumping test data for geohydraulic characteristics are most commonly interpreted by graphictechniques. The analytical method used for interpretation of the data will depend upon the physicalcharacteristics of the aquifer and test wells. The assumptions inherent in the analytical method usedto calculate aquifer characteristics should be evaluated to ensure acceptance of the method for thesubsurface conditions present at the site under investigation. The interpretation of aquifer pumping test data is not unique. Similar sets of data can be ob- tained from various combinations of geologic conditions. Field data of drawdown vs. time and/or distance are plotted on graph paper either by hand or using programs such as AQTESOLV \u00ae or a spreadsheet program. There are numerous methods of interpreting pumping test data. The methodto be used for each pumping test should be selected based on site-specific conditions (aquifer condi-tions, test conditions, assumptions made, etc.). Most hydrogeology text books contain pumping testevaluation techniques. Two publications dealing with pump test analysis are recommended(Kruseman and de Ridder, 1991 and Dawson and Istok, 1991). C.3.1.1.2 Hydraulic Conductivity from Slug Tests Slug tests are a commonly used alternative to pumping tests that are relatively easy to conduct. The biggest advantage of slug tests is that no contaminated water is produced during the test. Duringpumping tests at fuel-hydrocarbon-contaminated sites, large volumes of contaminated water thatmust be treated typically are produced. One commonly cited drawback to slug testing is that thismethod generally gives hydraulic conductivity information only for the area immediately surround-ing the monitoring well. If slug tests are going to be relied upon to provide information on the three-dimensional distribution of hydraulic conductivity in an aquifer, multiple slug tests must be per-formed, both within the same well and at several monitoring wells at the site. It is not advisable torely on data from one slug test in a single monitoring well. Data obtained during slug testing aregenerally analyzed using the method of Hvorslev (1951) for confined aquifers or the method ofBouwer and Rice (1976) and Bouwer (1989) for unconfined conditions. C.3.1.2 Transmissivity The transmissivity, T, of an aquifer is the product of the aquifer's hydraulic conductivity, K, and the saturated thickness, b: TK b= eq. C.3.1 For a confined aquifer, b is the thickness of the aquifer between confining units. For uncon- fined aquifers, b is the saturated thickness of the aquifer measured from the water table to the under-lying confining layer. Transmissivity has the units of length squared over time [L 2/T]. C.3.1.3 Hydraulic Head and Gradient Determining the magnitude of hydraulic gradients is important because gradients influence the direction and rate of contaminant migration. Hydraulic head, H, and specifically, variations inhydraulic head within an aquifer, is the driving force behind ground-water movement and solutemigration. The total hydraulic head at one location in a system is the sum of the elevation head,pressure head, and velocity head (Figure C.3.2): Hh h head [L] hz= elevation head = z = elevation relative to the reference plane [L] hp= pressure head [L] hv= velocity given by: hP gp= Where: p= fluid pressure = density g = acceleration due to gravity Velocity head is given by: hv gv=2 2 Where: v= ground-water velocity g = acceleration due to gravity Because hv is generally assumed to be zero for most ground-water flow, the relationship for total head is generally written: Hzp g=+ eq. C.3.3 Thus, the total hydraulic head at a point measured by a piezometer is the sum of the elevation at the base of the piezometer plus the length of the water column in the piezometer. The total hydraulichead in a piezometer is determined by measuring the depth from a surveyed reference point (datum)to the surface of the standing water. The elevation of the water surface is the total hydraulic head inthe piezometer. This total head is the total head at the base of the piezometer, not the water tableelevation, unless the piezometer terminates immediately below the water table or is a well screened Figure C.3.2 Hydraulic head.Mean Sea Level (Reference Elevation)Ground Surface Water T ableMeasurement Datum Open-ended Tube (Piezometer)A B Total Head (H) Elevation Head (z)Elevation Head (z)Pressure Head = Pressure Head = Total Head (H)Depth to WaterDepth to Water P g P gC3-22across the water table. Figure C.3.2 shows a pair of nested piezometers that illustrate the relation- ships between total hydraulic head, pressure head, and elevation head. Because ground water flowsfrom areas with high total head (point A, Figure C.3.2) to areas with lower total head (point B), thisfigure depicts a water table aquifer with a strong upward vertical gradient. This figure illustrateshow nested piezometers (or wells) are used to determine the importance of vertical gradients at asite. This figure also illustrates the importance of using wells screened in the same portion of theaquifer (preferably across the water table) when preparing potentiometric surface maps. The hydraulic gradient (dH/dL) is a dimensionless number that is the change in hydraulic head (dH) between two points divided by the length of ground-water flow between these same two points,parallel to the direction of ground-water flow, and is given by: Hydraulic Gradient =dH dLeq. C.3.4 Where: dH= change in total hydraulic head between two points [L] dL= distance between the two points used for head measurement [L] In a system where flow is not occurring, the total hydraulic head, H, is the same everywhere in the system and the hydraulic gradient is zero. To accurately determine the hydraulic gradient, it isnecessary to measure ground-water levels in all monitoring wells at the site. Because hydraulicgradients can change over a short distance within an aquifer, it is essential to have as much site-specific ground-water elevation information as possible so that accurate hydraulic gradient calcula-tions can be made. In addition, seasonal variations in ground-water flow direction can have a pro-found influence on contaminant transport. To determine the effect of seasonal variations in ground-water flow direction on contaminant transport, quarterly ground-water level measurements should betaken over a period of at least 1 year. The hydraulic gradient must be determined parallel to the direction of ground-water flow. Unless two monitoring wells screened in the same relative location within the same hydrogeologicunit are located along a line parallel to the direction of ground-water flow, the potentiometric surfacemap is generally used to determine the hydraulic gradient. To determine the hydraulic gradient, anengineer's scale is used to draw a line perpendicular to the equal-potential lines on the potentiomet-ric surface map (i.e., parallel to the direction of ground-water flow). Measure the distance betweenthe two equal-potential lines, making note of the ground-water potential at each equal-potential line.Subtract the larger potential from the smaller potential, and divide this number by the distancebetween the two equal potential lines, being sure to use consistent units. The number generated willbe a negative number because water flows from areas of higher potential to areas of lower potential. Example C.3.1: Hydraulic Gradient Calculation Given the water table elevation map shown in Figure C.3.3, calculate the hydraulic gradient between points A and B. Assume that all wells are screened across the water table. Solution: The hydraulic gradient is given by dH/dL. The line connecting points A and B is parallel to the direction of ground-water flow. The water table elevation is 4659.34 ft msl at point A and4602.41 ft msl at point B. Therefore, because ground water flows from areas of high head to between the two points A and B is 936 feet. Effective Porosity (ne) Total porosity (n) is the volume of voids in a unit volume of aquifer. Specific retention is the amount of water (volumetric) that is retained against the force of gravity after a unit volume of anunconfined aquifer is drained. Storativity is defined as the volume of water that a confined aquifertakes into or releases from storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit change in total hydrau-lic head. Effective porosity, n e, is the total porosity of the aquifer minus the specific retention (un- confined) or storativity (confined) [dimensionless] Effective porosity can be estimated using the results of a tracer test. Although this is potentially themost accurate method, time and monetary constraints can be prohibitive. For this reason, the mostcommon technique is to use an accepted literature value for the types of materials making up theaquifer matrix, and then to calibrate a contaminant transport model by adjusting the value of effec-tive porosity (in conjunction with other input parameters such as transmissivity) within the range ofA B 0 150 EQUAL GROUND WATER ELEVATION (FEET ABOVE MSL)4664.53 4653.38 4634.154659.34 Figure C.3.3 Ground water elevation map.C3-24accepted literature values until the modeled and observed contaminant distribution patterns match. Because aquifer materials can have a range of effective porosity, sensitivity analyses should beperformed to determine the effect of varying the effective porosity on numerical model results.Values of effective porosity chosen for the sensitivity analyses should vary over the accepted rangefor the aquifer matrix material. Table C.3.2 presents accepted literature values for total porosity andeffective porosity. Table C.3.2 Representative Values of Dry Bulk Density, Total Porosity, and Effective Porosity for Common Aquifer Matrix Materials (After Walton, 1988 and Domenico and Schwartz, 1990) Aquifer Sediments1.15-2.10 --- Sandy Clay --- --- 0.03-0.2 Silt --- 0.75-1.60 Ground-water Flow Velocity (Seepage or Advective Velocity) The average linear ground-water flow velocity (seepage velocity) in one dimension in the direction parallel to ground-water flow in a saturated porous medium is given by:C3-25vK dLx e= eq. The average linear ground-water flow velocity should be calculated to estimate ground-water flow and solute transport velocity, to check the accuracy of ground-water models, and to calculate first-order biodegradation rate constants. Example C.3.2: Linear Ground-water Flow Velocity Calculation Calculate the linear ground-water flow velocity in a medium-grained sandy aquifer. The hy- draulic gradient as determined from the potentiometric surface map in the previous example is -0.06 m/m. The hydraulic conductivity is 1.7x10 -1 m/day as determined by pumping tests. Solution: Because the effective porosity of this sediment is not known, it is necessary to estimate this parameter. From Table C.3.2, the effective porosity for a medium-grained is Coefficient of Retardation and Retarded Contaminant Transport Velocity When the average linear velocity of a dissolved contaminant is less than the average linear velocity of the ground water, the contaminant is said to be \"retarded.\" The difference between thevelocity of the ground water and that of the contaminant is caused by sorption and is described by thecoefficient of retardation, R, which parallel to ground-water flow vc= average velocity of contaminant parallel to groundwater flow The ratio vx/vc describes the relative velocity between the ground water and the dissolved contami- nant. When Kd = 0 (no sorption), the transport velocities of the ground water and the solute are equal (vx = vc). If it can be assumed that sorption is adequately described by the distribution coefficient, the coefficient of retardation for a dissolved contaminant (for (Section C.3.1.6.2) n= total porosityC3-26This relationship expresses the coefficient of retardation in terms of the bulk density and effective porosity of the aquifer matrix and the distribution coefficient for the contaminant. Substitution relative to the advective transport velocity of the ground-water flow system has important implications for natural attenuation. If retardation is occurring, dissolvedoxygen and other electron acceptors traveling at the advective transport velocity of the ground watersweep over the contaminant plume from the upgradient margin. This results in greater availability ofelectron acceptors within the plume for biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons. In addition, adsorptionof a contaminant to the aquifer matrix results in dilution of the dissolved contaminant plume. C.3.1.6.1 Bulk Density The bulk density of a soil, b, as used in most ground-water models, expresses the ratio of the mass of dried soil to its total volume (solids and pores together). mass of solid in the system VT= total volume in the system Vs= volume of solid in the system Va= volume of air (or gas) in the system Vw= volume of water (or liquid) in the system Bulk density is related to particle density by: bsn=1af density of grains comprising the aquifer The bulk density is always less than the particle density, s; for example, if pores constitute half the volume, then b is half of s. The bulk density of a soil is affected by the structure of the soil (looseness and degree of compaction), as well as by its swelling and shrinking characteristics, bothof which depend on clay content and soil moisture. Even in extremely compacted soil, the bulkdensity remains appreciably lower than the particle density. This is because the particles can neverinterlock perfectly, and the soil remains a porous body, never completely impervious. In sandy soils, b can be as high as 1.81 gm/cm3. In aggregated loams and clayey soils, b can be as low as 1.1gm/cm3. Table C.3.2 contains representative values of dry bulk density for common sediments and rocks. C.3.1.6.2 Distribution Coefficient and Total Organic Carbon Content The distribution coefficient is described in Section B.4.3. Recall equation B.4.10, which gives the relationship between organic carbon content [L3/M] foc = fraction soil organic carbon (mg organic carbon/mg soil) [M/M] Representative Koc values are given in Table B.4.1. The fraction of soil organic carbon must be determined from site-specific data. Representative values of total organic carbon (TOC) in commonsediments are given in Table C.3.3. Because most solute transport occurs in the most transmissiveaquifer zones, it is imperative that soil samples collected for total organic carbon analyses come fromthese zones in background areas. To be conservative, the average of all total organic carbon concen-trations from sediments in the most transmissive aquifer zone should be used for retardation calcula-tions.

Table C.3.4 presents the estimated coefficient of retardation contaminant velocity for a number of contaminants under the conditions of Example C.3.3. This example illustrates that contaminantsorption to total organic carbon can have a profound influence on contaminant transport by signifi-cantly slowing the rate of dissolved contaminant migration. Table C.3.4 Example Retardation Calculations for Select Compounds Fraction Distribution Bulk Advective Contaminant KocOrganic Coefficient Density TERM CALCULATIONS NAPLs present in the subsurface represent a continuing source of ground-water contamination. NAPLs may be made up of one compound, or more likely, a mixture of compounds. Concentrationsof dissolved contaminants and the lifetime of NAPL source areas and associated ground-waterplumes are ultimately determined by the rate at which contaminants dissolve from the NAPL. Whensufficient quantities of NAPL are present, the unsaturated zone may initially be saturated withC3-29NAPL, and the NAPL may migrate under the influence of gravity. After a period of time the NAPL may drain from the pores under the influence of gravity, leaving a thin coating of NAPL. Dependingon the surface area of the subsurface materials, the surface tension of the NAPL, and the porosity andpermeability of the subsurface materials, some NAPL also may be held between the grains by capil-larity. NAPL adhering to the grains of the aquifer matrix or retained by capillarity is herein referredto as residual NAPL. In residual zones, NAPL will be present in immobile blobs or ganglia that mayoccupy 10 percent or less of the pore space (Feenstra and Guiguer, 1996). If the NAPL is at satura-tion and is mobile within and among the pores of the aquifer matrix, the NAPL is referred to asmobile NAPL. Mobile NAPL may occupy as much as 50 to 70 percent of the pore space and canreduce flow of water through these zones. In the unsaturated zone, dissolution from residual or mobile NAPL into downward-migrating precipitation (recharge) will occur, as well as migration and dissolution of vapors. In the saturatedzone, dissolution of contaminants from residual NAPL occurs as ground-water flows through theresidual zone. Dissolution from mobile NAPL mostly takes place along the tops, bottoms, or lateralmargins of the NAPL bodies, because ground-water (or recharge) flow through the NAPL is re-stricted. Because the distribution of residual NAPL results in a greater surface area of product incontact with ground water and does not restrict ground-water velocities, concentrations of contami-nants entering ground water will typically be closer to the compounds' equilibrium solubilities thanin the case of mobile NAPL bodies. The equilibrium solubility of the compound(s) of interest willdepend on the composition of the NAPL (i.e., the molar fraction of the NAPL represented by thecompound). In general, residual and mobile NAPL may be present above or below the water table, but direct dissolution into ground water will only occur when NAPL is at or below the capillary fringe. Ineither case, quantifying the flux of contamination entering ground water from above or below thewater table is a difficult proposition. The processes governing dissolution from NAPLs are complexand depend upon many variables (Feenstra and Guiguer, 1996). Among these variables (in thesaturated zone) are the shape of a mobile NAPL body, the contact area between the NAPL and theground water, the velocity of the ground water moving through or past the NAPL, the effect ofresidual NAPL on the effective porosity of the contact zone, the solubility of the compounds ofinterest, the relative fractions of the compounds in the NAPL, the diffusion coefficients of the com-pounds, and the effects of other compounds present in the NAPL. This will be further complicatedby any processes in the vadose zone (e.g., volatilization, dissolution from residual NAPL into re-charge, or dissolution of vapors into recharge) that also will add contaminant mass to ground water.Further, as the mass of the NAPL body changes over time, the rate of dissolution will also change.Clearly, given the number of variables that affect the transfer of contaminant mass to ground water, itis difficult to accurately estimate the flux of contaminants into ground water. Depending on theintended use of the flux estimate, different approaches can be used. If one desires to estimate a source term for a contaminant fate and transport model, one can attempt to estimate the mass loading rate and use that estimate as an input parameter. However, thisoften does not yield model concentrations (dissolved) that are similar to observed concentrations. Asa result, the source in the model often becomes a calibration parameter (Mercer and Cohen, 1990;Spitz and Moreno, 1996). This is because the effects of the source (i.e., the dissolved contaminantplume) are easier to quantify than the actual flux from the source. The frequent need for such a\"black box\" source term has been borne out during modeling associated with evaluations of naturalattenuation of fuel hydrocarbons [following the AFCEE technical protocol (Wiedemeier et al.,1995d)] at over 30 U.S. Air Force sites. Use of other methods to calculate source loading for those models often produced model concentrations that differed from observed concentrations by asC3-30much as an order of magnitude. From the model, the flux estimate then can be used for estimating source lifetimes or other such calculations. For other purposes, one can estimate flux using several methods, as summarized by Feenstra and Guiguer (1996). For bodies of mobile LNAPL, this is more practical, because the area of NAPLin contact with ground water can be estimated from plume/pool dimensions. Where most NAPL isresidual, the surface area can be highly variable, and cannot be measured in the field. Laboratorystudies to understand and quantify mass transfer from residual NAPL in porous media are in theearly stages, and when such mass transfer is modeled, surface area is a calibration parameter withgreat uncertainty (Abriola, 1996). Most methods of estimating NAPL dissolution rates require anestimate of the contact area and, therefore, will contain a great deal of uncertainty. This is one of themain reasons why, for purposes of modeling, the \"black box\" source term is more commonly used. One reason practitioners want to estimate mass transfer rates is to provide a basis for estimating contaminant source lifetimes, which can affect regulatory decisions and remedial designs. To deter-mine how long it will take for a dissolved contaminant plume to fully attenuate, it is necessary toestimate how fast the contaminants are being removed from the NAPL. In general, it is difficult toestimate cleanup times, so conservative estimates should be made based on NAPL dissolution rates.Predicting the cleanup time for sites with mobile NAPL is especially difficult because residualNAPL will remain after the recoverable mobile NAPL has been removed. Of course, this is allcomplicated by the many factors that affect dissolution rates as discussed above. Moreover, mostmethods do not account for changing dissolution rates as a result of NAPL volume loss (and subse-quent surface area decrease), preferential partitioning from mixed NAPLs, and the change in porosity(and, therefore, ground-water velocity) resulting from NAPL dissolution. Finally, the mass of theNAPL present in the subsurface must also be estimated, lending further uncertainty to any calcula-tion of source lifetime. There are several ways to quantify the mass loading rate from a body of mobile or residual NAPL. Feenstra and Guiguer (1996) present a good summary of some common methods. As notedabove, transfer rates calculated from these methods are all dependent upon several parameters, manyof which cannot be measured or derived from the literature. This is especially true for residualNAPL. Johnson and Pankow (1992) present a method for estimating dissolution rates from pools ofNAPL which contact ground water over an area that is essentially two-dimensional. Many otherdissolution models may be available; however, as noted before, the experimental evidence to supportdissolution models is really just starting to be collected. Despite these limitations, some of thesemodels can prove useful, and a selected few are presented (in limited detail) in the following subsec-tions. If estimating mass flux rates is less important, one can use direct measurement or equilibrium concentration calculations to estimate contaminant source area concentrations. The first methodinvolves directly measuring the concentration of dissolved contaminants in ground water near theNAPL plume. The second method involves the use of partitioning calculations. These approachesare described in the following sections. This type of data can be useful if it can be demonstrated thatthe source is not capable of introducing concentrations of compounds of concern that exceed regula-tory limits, or that with slight weathering the same results can be expected. Source area concentra-tions, whether measured or calculated, also may be used to provide calibration targets for transportmodels in which a \"black box\" source term is used. If contaminant concentrations in the residual and mobile NAPL are not decreasing over time, or if they are decreasing very slowly, extremely long times will be required for natural attenuation of thedissolved contaminant plume. This will likely make natural attenuation less feasible and will reducethe chance of implementation. In order for natural attenuation to be a viable remedial option, theC3-31source of continuing ground-water contamination must be decreasing over time (decaying), either by natural weathering processes or via engineered remedial solutions such as mobile NAPL recovery,soil vapor extraction, bioventing, or bioslurping. Because natural weathering processes can be fairlyslow, especially in systems where the NAPL dissolves slowly or is inhibited from volatilizing orbiodegrading, it will generally be necessary to implement engineered remedial solutions to removethe NAPL or reduce the total mass of residual and dissolved NAPL. A discussion of estimating source terms for sites contaminated solely with fuel hydrocarbons is presented by Wiedemeier et al. (1995a). In general, estimating dissolution rates of individual com- pounds from fuels is simpler than estimating rates of dissolution from other NAPL mixtures becausethere is a great deal of experimental evidence regarding partitioning and equilibrium solubilities ofindividual compounds from common fuel mixtures. Methods presented in the following subsectionscan use such data to reduce some of the uncertainty in source term calculations. Typical uses of chlorinated solvents (e.g.., degreasing or parts cleaning) and past disposal practices that generally mixed different waste solvents or placed many types of waste solvents inclose proximity have resulted in complex and greatly varying NAPL mixtures being released at sites.For mixtures containing other compounds (e.g., either DNAPLs containing multiple chlorinatedcompounds, or fuel LNAPLs containing commingled chlorinated compounds), the equilibriumsolubility of the individual compounds of interest must first be calculated, then that information canbe used in the common mass transfer rate calculations. Except in the case of pure solvent spills,therefore, the estimation of dissolution rates is then further complicated by this need to estimateequilibrium solubilities from the mixture. Because this work focuses largely on saturated-zone processes, vadose zone dissolution pro- cesses will not be discussed in any detail. However, this discussion will provide a starting point forestimating source terms for ground-water contaminant fate and transport modeling, as well as forestimating source and plume lifetimes. As a starting point, two basic methods of estimating ormeasuring equilibrium dissolved contaminant concentrations in the vicinity of NAPL bodies arepresented. In addition, methods for estimating fluxes summarized by Feenstra and Guiguer (1996)and presented by Johnson and Pankow (1992) will be briefly summarized. C.3.2.1 Direct Measurement of Dissolved Contaminant Concentrations in Ground Water in Contact with NAPL Two methods can be used to determine the dissolved concentration of contaminants in ground water near a NAPL plume. The first method involves collecting ground-water samples from near aNAPL lens in monitoring wells. The second method involves collecting samples of mixed NAPLand water from monitoring wells. C.3.2.1.1 Collecting Ground-water Samples from Near the NAPL This method involves carefully sampling ground water beneath a floating LNAPL lens or near a DNAPL lens. One way of collecting a ground-water sample from beneath a lens of floating LNAPLor above/adjacent to a DNAPL body involves using a peristaltic pump. For LNAPL, the depth to thebase of the mobile LNAPL is measured, a length of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubing thatwill reach 1 to 2 feet beneath the LNAPL is lowered into the well, and the sample is collected. ForDNAPL, the tube would be cut to reach 1 to 2 feet above the NAPL. Another useful technique forobtaining such samples where the depth to ground water is too deep to allow use of a peristalticpump is to use a Grundfos \u00ae pump. If a Grundfos\u00ae pump is used to collect a water sample from beneath LNAPL, it is imperative that the pump be thoroughly cleaned after each use, and that goodsampling logic be used (e.g., sample less contaminated wells first). Also, dedicated bladder pumpsthat are being used for long-term monitoring (LTM) in wells with NAPL can be used to collect watersamples from beneath or above the NAPL.C3-32C.3.2.1.2 Collecting Mixed Ground-water/NAPL Samples This method involves collecting a sample of ground water and NAPL from a monitoring well, placing the sample in a sealed container used for volatile organics analysis being careful to ensurethere is no headspace, allowing the sample to reach equilibrium, and submitting the water above orbelow the floating NAPL to a qualified laboratory for analysis. A disposable bailer generally worksbest for collection of this type of sample. Smith et al. (1981) has information on how to conduct such a test for LNAPL. Two or three samples should be collected from different monitoring wellscontaining NAPL at the site. This test should only be done when it is not possible to collect a dis-crete sample from above or below the NAPL. C.3.2.2 Equilibrium Partitioning Calculations The NAPL present at a site represents a continuing source of contamination because chlorinated solvents, BTEX, and other compounds will partition from the NAPL into the ground water. In suchcases, it is generally necessary to estimate the dissolved concentration of contaminants expected inground water near the LNAPL. Partitioning calculations can be performed for sites with NAPL toquantify contaminant loading from the NAPL into the ground water at the time the ground water orNAPL samples are collected. Such calculations allow a crude estimation of the impact of continuingsources of contamination on dissolved contaminant concentrations. The results of partitioningcalculations may show that even if the NAPL is allowed to remain in the ground, dissolved contami-nant concentrations will remain below regulatory guidelines. This is especially true when weatheredNAPLs with initially low contaminant concentrations are present. Partitioning calculations made byWiedemeier et al. (1993) showed that NAPL present in the subsurface at a fueling facility near Denver, Colorado, was incapable of producing dissolved contaminant concentrations in ground waterabove regulatory standards. Such partitioning calculations should be confirmed with an LTM pro-gram. On the other hand, if partitioning calculations indicate that continued dissolution will produce contaminant concentrations exceeding regulatory guidelines, further work will be needed. Thecontaminant concentrations calculated by equilibrium methods will clearly not provide mass fluxestimates that can be used in modeling; again, the \"black box\" methods will be more useful. More-over, there is no estimation of the actual mass flux across the entire body of NAPL and, therefore,source lifetimes and weathering rates cannot be estimated directly from partitioning data. Moreadvanced calculations, such as those that will be discussed in later sections, are then required, keep-ing in mind that greater uncertainties will be introduced. When found in the saturated zone, residual NAPL is extremely difficult to remove. Maximum contaminant concentrations resulting from such partitioning will occur when the ground water andNAPL reach equilibrium. Assuming that equilibrium is reached gives the most conservative model-ing results. C.3.2.2.1 Equilibrium Partitioning of Contaminants from Mobile NAPL into Ground Water Because most NAPLs will be a mixture of compounds, the solubilities of those compounds will be lower than the solubility of the individual compound (which is what is most commonly found inthe literature). For an organic NAPL mixture, the dissolved concentration of each compound (inequilibrium with the mixture) can be approximated by: CX of compound in the mixture Csat p,= solubility of pure compoundC3-33This equilibrium concentration may also be referred to as the effective solubility of the compound from the mixture. Experimental evidence (Banerjee, 1984; Broholm and Feenstra, 1995) approximations of effective solubilities for mixturesof structurally similar compounds, and that the relationship works best for binary mixtures of similarcompounds. For other mixtures, the error is greater due to the complex solubility relationshipscreated; however, the method is appropriate for many environmental studies for which there aremany other uncertainties (Feenstra and Guiguer, 1996). For complex mixtures (e.g., multiple identified and unidentified solvents, or mixed fuels and solvents), it will be necessary to estimate the weight percent and an average molecular weight of theunidentified fraction of the NAPL before the calculation can be completed. In doing so, it should beremembered that increasing the average molecular weight for the unidentified fraction will producegreater estimated effective solubilities for the identified contaminants. A higher molecular weightfor the unidentified fraction will result in a lower mole fraction for that fraction and, therefore,higher mole fractions (and solubilities) for the known compounds. Feenstra and Guiguer (1996)provide an example of these calculations for a mixture of chlorinated and nonchlorinated com-pounds. In the case of fuel hydrocarbon mixtures, experimental partitioning data has been collected and used to develop individual-compound solubility calculations, largely because fuel mixtures aresomewhat consistent in their makeup. The fuel-water partitioning coefficient, K fw, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of a compound in the fuel to the compound's equilibrium concentration inwater in contact concentration of the compound in the fuel [M/L3] Cw = concentration of the compound dissolved in ground water [M/L3] A summary of values of Kfw for BTEX and trimethylbenzenes (TMB) in jet fuel and gasoline are presented by Wiedemeier et al. (1995d), along with the relationships relating Kfw to the aqueous solubility of a pure compound in pure water, S, which can be used to estimate Kfw for compounds for which there is no experimental data. Using the definition of Kfw presented above, the maximum (equilibrium) total dissolved BTEX concentration resulting from the partitioning of BTEX from NAPL into ground water is given by: CC Kwf fw= eq. C.3.16 This relationship predicts the concentration of dissolved BTEX in the ground water if the LNAPL is allowed to remain in contact with the ground water long enough so that equilibrium between the twophases is reached. Further discussion and example calculations for this method are presented byWiedemeier et al. (1995d). C.3.2.3 Mass Flux Calculations In general, the rate of mass transfer from a NAPL can be given as the product of a mass transfer coefficient, a concentration difference, and a contact area. As Feenstra and Guiguer (1996) note, thedriving force for mass transfer is the concentration difference across a boundary layer between theNAPL and the ground water. The concentration difference can be approximated using the effectivesolubility of a compound (eq. C.3.14) and either the measured concentration of the compound inground water adjacent to the NAPL, or a calculated (theoretical) ground-water concentration. How-C3-34ever, the contact area and the mass transfer coefficient incorporate a great deal of uncertainty and are typically calibration parameters for modeling dissolution, as discussed previously. Once these parameters have been estimated, one can use them in a variety of models. In gen- eral, models for dissolution of NAPL in porous media either assume local equilibrium betweenphases, or assume that dissolution is a first-order process governed by the variables discussed above(Feenstra and Guiguer, Abriola and Pinder (1985a), (1990) developed two-dimensional NAPL migration models that accountfor dissolution using the local equilibrium assumption (LEA). As noted by Abriola (1996), thesestudies generally were computer modeling studies for which follow-up laboratory work is ongoingand uncovering additional factors to consider. For single-component NAPLs, models utilizing afirst-order reaction have been developed by Miller et al. (1990), Powers et al. (1992), Brusseau (1992), Guiguer (1993), and Guiguer and Frind (1994). For multi-component NAPLs, a modeldeveloped by Shiu et al. (1988) and Mackay et al. (1991) may be of use. Due to approximate nature of flux calculations and the inherent uncertainty in those calcula- tions, we have chosen to omit a detailed discussion of such efforts. The numerical modeling usingLEA methods is beyond the scope of this work, and may not be practical for use at most sites. In-stead, we will present a brief review of ideas presented by Feenstra and Guiguer (1996) and Johnsonand Pankow (1992) in order to illustrate some of the concepts involved in estimating flux terms.Should further detail or other methods be desired, both of those works provide excellent backgroundand references to start with, including many of the works referenced in this discussion of source termcalculations. C.3.2.3.1 General Mass Transfer Models Using concepts from the field of chemical engineering, Feenstra and Guiguer (1996) note that for a single-component NAPL, simple dissolution of the compound may be described by: NKC C cw s a t= bg eq. flux Kc= mass transfer coefficient (L/T) Cw= concentration of compound in bulk aqueous phase (M/L3) Csat= concentration of compound at NAPL-water interface (taken as the solubility of the compound) (M/L3) The mass transfer coefficient may be calculated various ways, but in all cases, the diffusivity of thespecies of interest is a factor. Feenstra and Guiguer (1996) present three methods for determining amass transfer coefficient. In a porous media, the mass transfer rate per volume of porous medium can be defined by multiplying the mass flux by the ratio of NAPL surface contact area to the unit volume of porousmedium, NC C ws a t*=bg eq. C.3.18 Where: N*= flux of the species of interest per unit volume of porous medium (M/L2T) = lumped mass transfer coefficient (L/T) Cw= concentration of compound in bulk aqueous phase (M/L3) Csat= concentration of compound at NAPL-water interface (taken as the solubility of the compound) (M/L3) The lumped mass transfer coefficient is the product of Kc and the ratio of the NAPL surface contactC3-35area and the unit volume of the porous media. This can further be extended for multicomponent NAPLs : NC Cmm w h eq. C.3.19 Where: Nm*= flux of component m per unit volume of porous medium (M/L2T) m= lumped mass transfer coefficient for component m (L/T) Cwm,= concentration of component m in bulk aqueous phase (M/L3) Csat m,= concentration of component m at NAPL-water interface (calculated using eq. C.3.14) (M/L3) Further complicating all of these relationships is the fact that as dissolution continues, m will vary over time as the amount of NAPL changes. This can be accounted by using the following first-orderrelation: NS C Cmw m s a t m w m=,, c h eq. C.3.20 Where: Nm= flux of component m per unit volume of porous medium (M/L2T) Sw= average fraction of pore volume occupied by water m= lumped mass transfer coefficient for component m (L/T) Cwm,= concentration of component m in bulk aqueous phase (M/L3) Csat m,= concentration of component m at NAPL-water interface (calculated using eq. C.3.14)) (M/L3) Again, it bears repeating that on the field scale, measurement of many of the parameters used for these calculations is not possible, and, therefore, great uncertainty is introduced. Source termscalculated using these or any other methods should be presented in that light, and if used for solutetransport modeling, should be accompanied with a sensitivity analysis. C.3.2.3.2 Nonequilibrium Partitioning Model of Johnson and Pankow (1992) The steady-state, two-dimensional dissolution of contaminants from a pool of NAPL floating on the water table into ground water (assumed to be a semi-infinite medium) can be described by thesteady-state, two-dimensional, advection-dispersion equation (Hunt et 20, linear ground-water velocity Dz= vertical dispersion coefficient If it is assumed that: The time required for total NAPL dissolution is exceedingly long in comparison to the contact time between the NAPL pool and the flowing ground water The NAPL pool is wide compared to the horizontal transverse mixing process The NAPL pool can be approximated as a rectangle The NAPL lens width does not affect the dissolution rate The elevation of the NAPL lens is taken as z=0, with z measured positively upward The boundary conditions are:C3-36C(x, z = ) = 0 C(x, z = 0) = Ce 0 x L C(x = 0, z) = 0Where: C = contaminant concentration dissolved in waterC e= effective water solubility L = horizontal length of NAPL pool then the rate of dissolution of constituents from an LNAPL lens into ground water flowing beneaththe lens can be calculated as two-dimensional, steady-state dissolution, and the surface area averagedmass transfer rate, M a, is calculated as (Johnson and Pankow, 1992; Hunt to ground-water flow direction vx= average linear ground-water flow velocity Ce= effective water solubility (proportional to a compound's pure phase solubility and mole fraction in The vertical dispersion coefficient, Dz, results from a combination of molecular diffusion and me- chanical dispersion and is defined as vertical dispersivity (typically 0.01 of longitudinal dispersivity) vx= average linear ground-water flow velocity A typical value of De for a nonpolar organic compound is 1 x 10-5 cm2/sec (Sellers and Schreiber, 1992). \"At very low flow velocities where molecular diffusion dominates, the average concentration decreases with increasing flow velocity because of decreasing contact time. At higher groundwaterflow velocities where dispersion dominates over diffusion, average percent solubility becomesindependent of velocity. This is because the transverse dispersion coefficient is proportional to flowvelocity, and D z/v is constant. At typical groundwater flow velocities, an effluent concentration far less than the solubility limit is expected. For example, for a flow velocity of 1 m/day and z=10-4 m, less than 1 percent of solubility is predicted, and considerable pumping would be required to removethe contaminant. The analysis predicts a constant contaminant concentration dissolved in the ex-tracted water as long as the separate phase covers the boundary\" (Hunt et al., 1988, pp. 1253 and 1254).C3-37C.3.3 CONFIRMING AND QUANTIFYING BIODEGRADATION Chemical evidence of two types can be used to document the occurrence of biodegradation. The first type of evidence is graphical and is provided by the electron acceptor and metabolicbyproduct maps discussed in Section C.2. The second line of evidence involves using a conservativetracer. C.3.3.1 Isopleth Maps The extent and distribution of contamination relative to electron acceptors and metabolic byproducts can be used to qualitatively document the occurrence of biodegradation. Depleteddissolved oxygen concentrations in areas with fuel hydrocarbon contamination indicates that anactive zone of aerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation is present. Depleted nitrate and sulfate concen-trations in areas with fuel hydrocarbon contamination indicate that an active zone of anaerobichydrocarbon biodegradation is present and that denitrification and sulfate reduction are occurring.Elevated iron (II) and methane concentrations in areas with fuel hydrocarbon contamination indicatethat an active zone of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation is present and that iron reduction andmethanogenesis are occurring. Isopleth maps of contaminants, electron acceptors, and metabolicbyproducts can be used as evidence that biodegradation of fuel hydrocarbons is occurring.Figures C.2.7 and C.2.8 show how these maps can be used to support the occurrence of biodegrada-tion. Figure C.2.7 shows that areas with depleted dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate correspondwith areas having elevated BTEX concentrations. Figure C.2.8 shows that areas with elevatediron (II) and elevated methane concentrations also coincide with areas having elevated BTEX con-centrations. These figures suggest that aerobic respiration, denitrification, iron reduction, sulfatereduction, and methanogenesis are all occurring at the example site. C.3.3.2 Data Set Normalization In order to calculate biodegradation rates accurately, measured contaminant concentrations must be normalized for the effects of dispersion, dilution, and sorption. A convenient way to do this is touse compounds or elements associated with the contaminant plume that are relatively unaffected orpredictably affected by biologic processes occurring within the aquifer. At sites where commingledfuel hydrocarbon and chlorinated solvent plumes are present, the trimethylbenzene isomers (TMB),which can be biologically recalcitrant under some geochemical conditions have proven useful whenestimating biodegradation rates for BTEX and chlorinated solvents. At sites where TMB data arenot available, the chloride produced as a result of biodegradation or the carbon nucleus of the chlori-nated compound can be used as a tracer. Measured concentrations of tracer and contaminant from a minimum of two points along a flow path can be used to estimate the amount of contaminant that would be expected to remain at eachpoint if biodegradation were the only attenuation process operating to reduce contaminant concentra-tions. The fraction of contaminant remaining as a result of all attenuation processes can be com-puted from the measured contaminant concentrations at two adjacent points. The fraction of con-taminant that would be expected to remain if dilution and dispersion were the only mechanisms forattenuation can be estimated from the tracer concentrations at the same two points. The tracer isaffected by dilution and dispersion to the same degree as the contaminant of interest and is notaffected by biologic processes. The following equation uses these assumptions to solve for theexpected downgradient contaminant concentration if biodegradation had been the only attenuationprocess operating between two points along the flow path: CCT o downgradient CB= measured contaminant concentration at point B TA= tracer concentration at a point A upgradient TB= tracer concentration at point B downgradient This equation can be used to estimate the theoretical contaminant concentration that would result from biodegradation alone for every point along a flow path on the basis of the measured contami-nant concentration at the origin and the dilution of the tracer along the flow path. This series ofnormalized concentrations can then be used to estimate a first-order rate of biodegradation as de-scribed in Section C.3.3.3. C.3.3.2.1 Normalization Using Organic Compounds as Tracers A convenient way of estimating biodegradation rate constants is to use compounds present in the dissolved contaminant plume that that are biologically recalcitrant. One such compound that isuseful in some, but not all, ground-water environments is Trimethylbenzene (TMB). The threeisomers of this compound 1,3,5-TMB) are generally present in suffi- cient quantities in fuel mixtures to be readily detectable when dissolved in ground water. Whenchlorinated solvents enter the subsurface as a mixture with petroleum hydrocarbons, the TMBcompounds can be useful tracers. The TMB isomers are fairly recalcitrant to biodegradation underanaerobic conditions; however, the TMB isomers do not make good tracers under aerobic conditions(because they are readily biodegraded in aerobic environments). The degree of recalcitrance of TMBis site-specific, and the use of this compound as a tracer must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.Nevertheless, if any TMB mass is lost to biodegradation, equation C.3.24 will be conservativebecause the calculated mass losses and the attenuation rate constants calculated on the basis of thoselosses will be lower than the actual losses and attenuation rates. Another compound of potential useas a conservative tracer is tetramethylbenzene; however, detectable dissolved tetramethylbenzeneconcentrations are generally less common than detectable dissolved TMB concentrations. An ideal tracer would have Henry's Law and soil sorption coefficients identical to the contami- resulting in a higher soil sorption coefficient than the compound of interest. As aresult, use of TMB as a tracer is often conservative, and the biodegradation rates can be underesti-mated. It is best, whenever possible, to compare several tracers to determine whether they areinternally consistent. C.3.3.2.2 Normalization Using Inorganics as Tracers Inorganic compounds also can serve as tracers for the contaminant of interest as long as their presence is in some way associated (either directly or indirectly) with the dissolved contaminantplume. For many chlorinated solvent plumes, the sum of ionic chloride and organic chloride associ-ated with the solvents can be considered a conservative tracer. Note that the following discussionassumes that the background chloride concentration is negligible in comparison to the source areaconcentration of total chloride plus chlorine. If background chloride is more than approximately 10percent of the total source area chloride plus chlorine concentration, then background concentrationswill need to be accounted for prior to performing the tracer normalization. Total chlorine can easily be calculated by multiplying the measured concentration of a chlori- nated organic compound by the mass fraction of chlorine in the molecule, then summing that quan-tity for all the chlorinated organic compounds represented in the plume. The stoichiometry forchlorinated ethenes is presented in the following paragraphs.C3-39As PCE to ethene, 4 moles of chloride are produced: C2Cl4C2H4 + 4Cl- On a mass basis, the ratio of chloride produced to PCE degraded is given by: of to PCE = 141.81:165.83 = 0.86:1 Similarly, as TCE moles of chloride are produced: C2Cl3HC2H4 + 3Cl- On a mass basis, the ratio of chloride produced to TCE degraded is given to TCE = 106.36:131.39 = 0.81:1 Likewise, as DCE moles of chloride are produced: C2Cl2H2C2H4 + 2Cl- On a mass basis, the ratio of chloride produced to DCE degraded is given gm Ratio Chloride to DCE = 70.9:96.95 = 0.73:1 As VC of chloride is produced: C2ClH3C2H4 + Cl- On a mass basis, the ratio of chloride produced to VC degraded is given Chloride to VC = 35.453:62.51 = 0.57:1 Therefore, the amount of total chloride plus chlorine for a spill undergoing reductive dechlorination would be estimated as: Example C.3.4: Calculating Total Concentration of Chloride and Organic Chlorine The approach is illustrated in the following data set from the West TCE Plume at the St. Joseph, Michigan NPL site. A series of discrete vertical water samples were taken in transects that extended across the plume at locations downgradient of the source of TCE. The locations of the samples are depicted inFigure C.3.5 as circles. At each sampling location, water samples were acquired using a hollow-stem auger. The leading auger was slotted over a five-foot interval. After a sample was collected,the auger was driven five feet further into the aquifer and the next sample was collected. At any onelocation, the water samples were collected in a sequential and contiunuous series that extended fromthe water table to a clay layer at the bottom of the aquifer. The concentrations of contaminants ateach location were averaged in water samples that extend across the entire vertical extent of theplume. The location with the highest average concentration of chlorinated ethenes in a particulartransect was selected to represent the centerline of the plume. The locations of the sample locationsin the centerline of the plume are depicted in Figure C.3.5 as open circles. Each centerline locationis labelled in an oval.C3-40The concentrations of chlorinated ethenes and chloride in the centerline of the TCE plume at St. Joseph, Michigan, are presented in Table C.3.5.

This results in an upgradient tracer concentration of TCE chlorine + (0.809)(12.1 the downgradient location 55AE, which is 2,000 feet from the source, the concentrations of TCE, total DCE, vinyl chloride, mg/L) 55.1 mg/LThe computed series of total chloride plus chlorine concentrations can be used with equation C.3.24 to estimate a normalized data set for contaminant concentrations. Example C.3.5: Normalizing Contaminant Concentrations Along a Flow Path Equation 3.24 will be used to calculate a normalized concentration for TCE at the locations depicted in Figure C.3.4 and Table C.3.5. Given are the observed concentrations of TCE and tracer(Table C.3.5) for five points that form a line parallel to the direction of ground-water flow (FigureC.3.4) To calculate normalized concentrations of TCE using the attenuation of the tracer, the dilu-tion of the tracer is caculated at each location by dividing the concentration of tracer at the source (ormost contaminated location) by the concentration of tracer at each downgradient location. Then themeasured concentration of TCE downgradient is multiplied by the dilution of the tracer. The cor-rected concentrations of TCE are presented in Table C.3.6. This information will be used in sectionsC.3.3.3 to calculate the rate of natural biodegradation of TCE. Table C.3.6.

Use of the first-order approximation can be appropriate to estimate biodegradation ratesC3-42for chlorinated compounds when the rate of biodegradation is controlled solely by the concentration of the contaminant. However, the use of a first-order approximation may not be appropriate whenmore than one substrate is limiting microbial degradation rates or when microbial mass is increasingor decreasing. In such cases, a second- or higher-order approximation may provide a better estimateof biodegradation rates. C.3.3.3.1 First-Order Decay As with a large number of processes, the change in a solute's concentration in ground water over time often can be described using a first-order rate constant. A first-order approximation, ifappropriate, has the advantage of being easy to calculate and simplifies fate and transport modelingof complex phenomenon. In one dimension, first-order decay is described by the following ordinarydifferential equation: dC attenuation rate (first-order rate CC eokt= eq. C.3.27 The overall attenuation rate groups all processes acting to reduce contaminant concentrations and includes advection, dispersion, dilution from recharge, sorption, and biodegradation. To determinethe portion of the overall attenuation that can be attributed to biodegradation, these effects must beaccounted for, and subtracted from the total attenuation rate. Aronson and Howard (1997) have compiled a large number of attenuation rate constants for biodegradation of organic compounds in aquifers. This information is supplied to provide a basis forcomparison of rate constants determined for at a particular site to the general experience with naturalattenuation as documented in the literature. It is not intended to provide rate constants for a site in arisk assessment or exposure assessment. The rate constants used to describe behavior of a particularsite must be extracted from site characterization information particular to that site. The distribution of the rate constants reported for TCE is presented in Figure C.3.5. Notice that the average rate is near 1.0 per year, and that most of the rates cluster in a relatively narrow rangebetween 3.0 per year and 0.3 per year. Some of the published rates are very low, less than 0.1 peryear. The report compiles data from sites where rates are published. The general bias against pub-lishing negative data suggests that there are many plumes where TCE attenuation was not detectable(Type 3 behavior), and that data on these plumes is not found in the literature. The data fromAronson and Howard (1997) reflect the behavior of plumes where reductive dechlorination is animportant mechanism (Type 1 and Type 2 sites). Rate constants for PCE and Vinyl Chloride arepresented in Figures C.3.6 and C.3.7. The average rate for dechlorination of PCE is somewhat fasterthan for TCE, near 4.0 per year, and the rate for Vinyl Chloride is slower, near 0.6 per year. Two methods for determining first-order biodegradation rates at the field scale are presented. The first method involves the use of a normalized data set to compute a decay rate. The secondmethod was derived by Buscheck and Alcantar (1995) and is valid for steady-state plumes.Wiedemeier et al. (1996b) compare the use of these two methods with respect to BTEX biodegrada- tion.C3-430.010.1110100 Rate Constant (/yr) Figure C.3.5.

C.3.3.3.2 Use of a Normalized Data Set In order to ensure that observed decreases in contaminant concentrations can be attributed to biodegradation, measured contaminant concentrations must be corrected for the effects of advection,dispersion, dilution from recharge, and sorption, as described in Section C.3.3.2 using equationC.3.24. The corrected concentration of a compound is the concentration that would be expected atone point (B) located downgradient from another point (A) if the processes of dispersion and dilutionhad not been occurring between points A and B. The biodegradation rate can be estimated between any two points (A and B) of a normalized data set (where point A is upgradient of point B) by substituting the concentration at point A for C 0, and the normalized concentration at point B, CB,corr, for C in equation C.3.27. The resulting relation- ship is expressed as: CC r ,= CB,corr = normalized eq. C.3.25) CA,= contaminant concentration at upgradient point A that if point A is the first point in the normalized data set, then CA = CA,corr = first-order biological decay rate (first-order rate constant) [1/T] t = time of contaminant travel between points A and B The rate constant in this equation is no longer the total attenuation rate, k, but is the biological decay rate, , because the effects of advection, dispersion, dilution from recharge, and sorption have been removed (Section C.3.3.2). This relationship can be used to calculate the first-order biologicaldecay rate constant between two points by solving equation C.3.28 for :C3-45=FHGIKJln,C C tB corr A eq. C.3.29 The travel time, t, between by: tx vc= velocity [L/T] Example C.3.6: First-Order Decay Rate Constant Calculation Using Normalized Data Set Equation C.3.30 and C.3.29 can be used to calculate rate constants between any two points along a flow line. For travel from locations T-2-5 and and 55AE in Figure C.3.4 and Table C.3.6,the upgradient concentration of TCE is 12.1 mg/l, the corrected downgradient concentration is 0.051mg/l, and the distance between the locations is 2,000 feet. From Figure C.3.4, the water table drops 10 feet as the plume moves 1,300 feet from transect 1 to transect 5. The site has a hydraulic gradient of 0.008 feet per foot. Aquifer testing at the sitepredicts an average hydraulic conductivity of 50 feet per day. If the effecive porosity of the sandyaquifer is assumed to be 0.3, the seepage velocity (V x ) would be (Equation C.3.6): Vft day ft ftft dayx=\u00d7=00 0 0 8 0313.4 . .. The average organic matter content of the aquifer matrix material is less than the detection limit of 0.001 g/g. We will assume the organic matter content is equal to the detection limit. If the Koc of TCE is 120 ml/g, the porosity is 0.3, and the bulk density is 1.7 gm/cm3, the distribution of TCE between ground water and aquifer solids is the product of the Koc, the fraction organic carbon, the bulk density, divided by the porosity, or 0.3. The retarded velocity of TCE compared to water (R)would be (Equation C.3.8 and Equation C.3.13): R = 1 + 120 (ml/g) * 0.001(g/g) * 1.7 (g/cm 3)/ 0.3 (ml/ ml) = 1.7 The velocity of TCE in the aquifer would be equal to the velocity of water in the plume divided by the retardation of TCE. The TCE velocity (vC) would be: vC = 1.3 feet per day/ 1.7 = 0.8 feet per day If the distance between the wells is 2,000 feet, and the retarded velocity of TCE is 0.8 feet per day, by equation C.3.30 the travel time is: t = 2,000 feet/ 0.8 feet per day = 2,500 days = 6.8 years From equation C.3.29, the rate of biotransformation between locations T-2-5 and 55AE is: = ln (0.055/12.1)/ 6.8 per year = 0.79 per year If a number of sampling locations are available along a flow path, all the locations should be included in the calculation of the biotransformation rate. The simplest way to determine the first-order rate constant from an entire set of normalized data is to make a log-linear plot of normalizedcontaminant concentrations versus travel time. If the data plot along a straight line, the relationshipis first-order and an exponential regression analysis can be performed. The exponential regression analysis gives the equation of the line of best fit for the data being regressed from a log-linear plot and has the general form:C3-46yb emx= eq. y= y axis m= slope of regression line x= x-axis value When using normalized data, x is the contaminant travel time to the downgradient locations and m is the first-order rate of change equal to the negative. The correlation coefficient, R2, is a measure of how well the regression relationship approximates the data. Values of R2 can range from 0 to 1; the closer R2 is to1, the more accurate the equation describing the trend in the data. Values of R2 greater than 0.80 are generally considered useful; R2 values greater than 0.90 are considered excellent. Several commonly available spreadsheets can be used to facilitate the exponential regression analy-sis. The following example illustrates the use of this technique. Figure C.3.8 depicts a regression of normalized TCE concentration against travel time downgradient. The slope of the exponential regression is -0.824 x where x is travel time in years, corresponding to a first-order rate of change of -0.824 per year and a first-order rate of biodegrada-tion of 0.824 per year. In Figure C.3.8, an exponential regression was performed on the normalizedconcentrations of TCE against time of travel along the flow path. An alternative approach would beto perform a linear regression of the natural logarithm of the normalized concentration of TCEagainst travel time along the flow path. Figure C.3.8 Exponential regression of TCE concentration on time of travel along flow path.y = 11.332e-0.824x R2 = 0.9332 0.010.1110100 of Buscheck and Alcantar (1995) Buscheck and Alcantar (1995) derive a relationship that allows calculation of first-order decay rate constants for steady-state plumes. This method involves coupling the regression of contaminantconcentration (plotted on a logarithmic scale) versus distance downgradient (plotted on a linearscale) to an analytical solution for steady-state, contaminant includesadvection, first-order biological rate constant vc = contaminant velocity in the x-direction x = dispersivity k/vx = slope of line formed by making a ln-linear plot of contaminant concentration versus distance downgradient along flow path Example C.3.7: First-Order Rate Constant Calculation Using Method of Buscheck and Alcantar (1995) The first step is to confirm that the contaminant plume has reached a steady-state configuration. This is done by analyzing historical data to make sure that the plume is no longer migratingdowngradient and that contaminant concentrations are not changing significantly through time. Thisis generally the case for older spills where the source has not been removed. The next step is tomake a plot of the natural logarithm of contaminant concentration versus distance downgradient (seeFigure C.3.9). Using linear regression, y in the regression analysis is the contaminant concentration,x is the distance downgradient from the source, and the slope of the ln-linear regression is the ratio k/ v x that is entered into equation C.3.32. The slope is -0.0028 feet. As calculated above, the retarded TCE velocity in the plume vc is 0.8 feet per day. If x = 5% of the plume length, then x = 100 feet. Inserting these values for x , k/vx, and vc into equation C.3.32, the estimated value of = -0.0016 per day or -0.59 per year. C.3.3.2.2.3 Comparison of First-Order Methods If the data are available, concentrations of tracers should be used to normalize concentrations of contaminants prior to calculation of rate constants. If tracer data is not available, the method ofBuscheck and Alcantar (1995) can be used if a value for longitudinal dispersion is available, or ifone is willing to assume a value for longitudinal dispersion. Whenever possible, more than onetracer should be used to normalize the concentrations of contaminants. If the normalized concentra-tions agree using several different tracers, the approach can be accepted with confidence. In additionto chloride and trimethylbenzene, methane, and total organic carbon dissolved in ground water areoften useful tracers in plumes of chlorinated solvents undergoing natural attenuation.C3-48Figure C.3.9 Regression of the TCE concentration on distance along flow path.y = 11.332e-0.0028x R2 = 0.9332 0.010.1110100 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Distance Downgradient (feet)TCE (mg/L)C3-49C.3.4 DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND INTERPRETATION OF MICROCOSM STUDIES C.3.4.1 Overview If properly designed, implemented, and interpreted, microcosm studies can provide very con- vincing documentation of the occurrence of intrinsic bioremediation. They are the only \"line ofevidence\" that allows an unequivocal mass balance on the biodegradation of environmental contami-nants. If the microcosm study is properly designed, it will be easy for decision makers with non-technical backgrounds to interpret. The results of a microcosm study are strongly influenced by thenature of the geological material submitted to study, by the physical properties of the microcosm, bythe sampling strategy, and the duration of the study. In addition, microcosm studies are time con-suming and expensive. A microcosm study should only be undertaken at sites where there is consid-erable uncertainty concerning the biodegradation of contaminants based on soil and ground-watersamples alone. Material for a microcosm study should not be selected until the geochemical behavior of the site is well understood. Contaminant plumes may consume oxygen, nitrate, or sulfate, and produce iron(II), manganese (II), or methane. These processes usually operate concurrently in different parts ofthe plume. Regions where each process prevails may be separated in directions parallel to ground-water flow by hundreds of meters, in directions perpendicular to ground-water flow by tens ofmeters, and vertically by only a few meters. Rate constants and constraints for petroleum hydrocar-bon biodegradation will be influenced by the prevailing geochemistry. Material from microcosmsmust be acquired for depth intervals and locations that have been predetermined to be representativeof the prevailing geochemical milieu in the plume. Contaminant biodegradation supported by oxygen and nitrate cannot be adequately represented in microcosm. In the field, organisms that use oxygen or nitrate proliferate until they become limitedby the supply of electron acceptor. After that time, the rate of hydrocarbon degradation is controlledby the supply of electron acceptor through diffusion or hydrodynamic dispersion. Microcosms havebeen simulate sulfate-reducing, regions ofplumes. Oxygen is toxic to sulfate-reducing and methanogenic microorganisms. Material should becollected and secured in a manner that precludes oxygenation of the sample. Batch microcosms that are sacrificed for each analysis usually give more interpretable results than column microcosms or batch microcosms that are sampled repetitively. For statistical reasons,at least three microcosms should be sampled at each time interval. If one assumes a first-order ratelaw, and no lag, a geometrical time interval for sampling should be the most efficient. An examplewould be sampling after 0 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and 8 months. As apractical matter, long lags frequently occur, and the rate of bioremediation after the lag is rapid. Asimple linear time scale is most likely to give interpretable results. The batch microcosms should have approximately the same ratio of solids to water as the original material. Most of the microbes are attached to solids. If a microcosm has an excess ofwater, and the contaminant is mostly in the aqueous phase, the microbes must process a great dealmore contaminant to produce the same relative change in the contaminant concentration as would beobtained at field scale. The kinetics at field scale would be underestimated. Microcosms are inherently time consuming. At field scale, the residence time of a plume may be several years to decades. Slow rates of transformation may have a considerable environmentalsignificance. A microcosm study that lasts only a few weeks or months may not have the resolutionto detect slow changes that are still of environmental significance. Further, microcosms often show apattern of sequential utilization, with toluene and the xylenes degrading first, and benzene andethylbenzene degrading at a later time. Degradation of benzene or ethylbenzene may be delayed byas much as a year.C3-50As a practical matter, batch microcosms with an optimal solids-to-water ratio, sampled every 2 months in triplicate for up to 18 months, can resolve biodegradation from abiotic losses with a ratedetection limit of 0.001 to 0.0005 per day. Many plumes show significant attenuation of contamina-tion at field-calibrated rates that are slower than the detection limit of today's microcosm technology.The most appropriate use of microcosms is to document that contaminant attenuation is largely abiological process. Rate constants for modeling purposes are more appropriately acquired fromfield-scale studies. Microcosm studies are often used to provide a third line of evidence. The potential for biodeg- radation of the contaminants of interest can be confirmed by the use of microcosms, through com-parison of removals in the living treatments with removals in the controls. Microcosm studies alsopermit an absolute mass balance determination based on biodegradation of the contaminants ofinterest. Further, the appearance of daughter products in the microcosms can be used to confirmbiodegradation of the parent compound. C.3.4.2 When to Use Microcosms There are two fundamentally different applications of microcosms. They are frequently used in a qualitative way to illustrate the important processes that control the fate of organic contaminants.They are also used to estimate rate constants for biotransformation of contaminants that can be usedin a site-specific transport and fate model of a plume of contaminated groundwater. This paper onlydiscusses microcosms for the second application. Microcosms should be used when there is no other way to obtain a rate constant for attenuation of contaminants, in particular, when it is impossible to estimate the rate of attenuation from datafrom monitoring wells in the plume of concern. There are situations where it is impossible to com-pare concentrations in monitoring wells along a flow path due to legal or physical impediments. Inmany landscapes, the direction of ground-water flow (and water table elevations in monitoring wells)can vary over short periods of time due to tidal influences or changes in barometric pressure. Thedirection of ground-water flow may also be affected by changes in the stage of a nearby river orpumping wells in the vicinity. These changes in ground-water flow direction do not allow simplesnap-shot comparisons of concentrations in monitoring wells because of uncertainties in identifyingthe flow path. Rate constants from microcosms can be used with average flow conditions to estimateattenuation at some point of discharge or point of compliance. C.3.4.3 Application of Microcosms The primary objective of microcosm studies is to obtain rate constants applicable to average flow conditions. These average conditions can be determined by continuous monitoring of watertable elevations in the aquifer being evaluated. The product of the microcosm study and the continu-ous monitoring of water table elevations will be a yearly or seasonal estimate of the extent of attenu-ation along average flow paths. Removals seen at field scale can be attributed to biological activity.If removals in the microcosms duplicate removal at field scale, the rate constant can be used for riskassessment purposes (B.H. Wilson et al., 1996; Bradley, et al.,1998). C.3.4.4 Selecting Material for Study Prior to choosing material for microcosm studies, the location of major conduits of ground- water flow should be identified and the geochemical regions along the flow path should be deter-mined. The important geochemical regions for natural attenuation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocar-bons are regions that are actively methanogenic; regions that exhibit sulfate reduction and ironreduction concomitantly; and regions that exhibit iron reduction alone. The pattern of biodegrada-tion of chlorinated solvents varies in different regions. Vinyl chloride tends to accumulate duringreductive dechlorination of TCE or PCE in methanogenic regions (Weaver et al., 1995; J.T. Wilson et al., 1995); it does not accumulate to the same extent in regions exhibiting iron reduction andC3-51sulfate reduction (Chapelle, 1996). In regions showing iron reduction alone, vinyl chloride is con- sumed but dechlorination of PCE, TCE, or DCE may not occur (Bradley and Chapelle, 1996;1997).Core material from each geochemical region in major flow paths represented by the plume must beacquired, and the hydraulic conductivity of each depth at which core material is acquired must bemeasured. If possible, the microcosms should be constructed with the most transmissive material inthe flow path. Several characteristics of ground water from the same interval used to collect the core material should be determined. These characteristics include temperature, redox potential, pH, and concen-trations of oxygen, sulfate, sulfide, nitrate, II, chloride, methane, ethane, ethene, total organiccarbon, and alkalinity. The concentrations of compounds of regulatory concern and any breakdownproducts for each site must be determined. The ground water should be analyzed for methane todetermine if methanogenic conditions exist and for ethane and ethene as daughter products fromreductive dechlorination of PCE and TCE. A comparison of the ground-water chemistry from theinterval where the cores were acquired to that in neighboring monitoring wells will demonstrate ifthe collected cores are representative of that section of the contaminant plume. Reductive dechlorination of chlorinated solvents requires an electron donor to allow the process to proceed. The electron donor could be soil organic matter, low molecular weight organic com-pounds (lactate, acetate, methanol, glucose, etc.), H 2, or a co-contaminant such as landfill leachate or petroleum compounds (Bouwer, 1994; Sewell and Gibson, 1991; Klecka et al., 1996). In many instances, the actual electron donor(s) may not be identified. Several characteristics of the core material should also be evaluated. The initial concentration of the contaminated material (on a mass per mass basis) should be identified prior to construction ofthe microcosms. Also, it is necessary to know if the contamination is present as a nonaqueous phaseliquid (NAPL) or in solution. A total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) analysis will determine if anyhydrocarbon-based oily materials are present. The water-filled porosity is a parameter generally usedto extrapolate rates to the field. It can be calculated by comparing wet and dry weights of the aquifermaterial. To insure sample integrity and stability during acquisition, it is important to quickly transfer the aquifer material into a jar, exclude air by adding ground water, and seal the jar without headspace.The material should be cooled during transportation to the laboratory. Incubate the core material atthe ambient ground-water temperature in the dark before the construction of microcosms. At least one microcosm study per geochemical region should be completed. If the plume is over one kilometer in length, several microcosm studies per geochemical region may need to beconstructed. C.3.4.5 Geochemical Characterization of the Site The geochemistry of the subsurface affects behavior of organic and inorganic contaminants, inorganic minerals, and microbial populations. Major geochemical parameters that characterize thesubsurface encompasses (1) pH; (2) ORP; (3) alkalinity; (4) physical and chemical characterizationof the solids; (5) temperature; (6) dissolved constituents, including electron acceptors; and (7) micro-bial processes. The most important of these in relation to biological processes are redox potential,alkalinity, concentration of electron acceptor, and chemical nature of the solids. Alkalinity: Field indications of biologically active portions of a plume may be identified by increased alkalinity, compared to background wells, from carbon dioxide due to biodegradation ofthe pollutants. Increases in both alkalinity and decrease in pH have been measured in portions of anaquifer contaminated by gasoline undergoing active utilization of the gasoline components(Cozzarelli et al., 1995). Alkalinity can be one of the parameters used when identifying where to collect biologically active core material.C3-52pH: Bacteria generally prefer a neutral or slightly alkaline pH level with an optimum pH range for most microorganisms between 6.0 and 8.0; however, many microorganisms can tolerate a pHrange of 5.0 to 9.0. Most ground waters in uncontaminated aquifers are within these ranges. NaturalpH values may be as low as 4.0 or 5.0 in aquifers with active oxidation of sulfides, and pH values ashigh as 9.0 may be found in carbonate-buffered systems (Chapelle, 1993). However, pH values aslow as 3.0 have been measured for ground waters contaminated with municipal waste leachateswhich often contain elevated concentrations of organic acids (Baedecker and Back, 1979). In groundwaters contaminated with sludges from cement manufacturing, pH values as high as 11.0 have beenmeasured (Chapelle, 1993). ORP: The ORP of ground water is a measure of electron activity that indicates the relative ability of a solution to accept or transfer electrons. Most redox reactions in the subsurface aremicrobially catalyzed during metabolism of native organic matter or contaminants. The only ele-ments that are predominant participants in aquatic redox processes are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,sulfur, iron, and manganese (Stumm and Morgan, 1981). The principal oxidizing agents in groundwater are oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, manganese (IV), and iron (III). Biological reactions in the subsur-face both influence and are affected by the redox potential and the available electron acceptors. Theredox potential changes with the predominant electron acceptor, with reducing conditions increasingthrough the sequence oxygen, nitrate, iron, sulfate, and carbonate. The redox potential decreases ineach sequence, with methanogenic (carbonate as the electron acceptor) conditions being most reduc-ing. The interpretation of redox potentials in ground waters is difficult (Snoeyink and Jenkins,1980). The potential obtained in ground waters is a mixed potential that reflects the potential ofmany reactions and cannot be used for quantitative interpretation (Stumm and Morgan, 1981). Theapproximate location of the contaminant plume can be identified in the field by measurement of theredox potential of the ground water. To overcome the limitations imposed by traditional redox measurements, recent work has focused on the measurement of molecular hydrogen to accurately describe the predominant in situ redox reactions (Chapelle et al., 1995; Lovley et al., 1994; Lovley and Goodwin, 1988). The evi- dence suggests that concentrations of H 2 in ground water can be correlated with specific microbial processes, and these concentrations can be used to identify zones of methanogenesis, sulfate reduc-tion, and iron reduction in the subsurface (Chapelle, 1996). Electron Acceptors: Measurement of the available electron acceptors is critical in identifying the predominant microbial and geochemical processes occurring in situ at the time of sample collec- tion. Nitrate and sulfate are found naturally in most ground waters and will subsequently be used aselectron acceptors once oxygen is consumed. Oxidized forms of iron and manganese can be used aselectron acceptors before sulfate reduction commences. Iron and manganese minerals solubilizecoincidently with sulfate reduction, and their reduced forms scavenge oxygen to the extent that strictanaerobes (some sulfate reducers and all methanogens) can develop. Sulfate is found in manydepositional environments, and sulfate reduction may be very common in many contaminatedground waters. In environments where sulfate is depleted, carbonate becomes the electron acceptorwith methane gas produced as an end product. Temperature: The temperature at all monitoring wells should be measured to determine when the pumped water has stabilized and is ready for collection. Below approximately 30 feet, thetemperature in the subsurface is fairly consistent on an annual basis. Microcosms should be stored atthe average in situ temperature. Biological growth can occur over a wide range of temperatures, although most microorganisms are active primarily between 10\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C (50\u00b0F to 95\u00b0F). of inorganic In aquifers with a low background of inorganic the concentration of inorganic chloride shouldC3-53increase as the chlorinated solvents are degraded. The sum of the inorganic chloride plus the chlo- ride in the contaminant being degraded should remain relatively consistent along the ground waterflow path. Tables C.3.7 and C.3.8 list the geochemical parameters, contaminants, and daughter products that should be measured during site characterization for natural attenuation. The tables include theanalyses that should be performed, the optimum range for natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents,and the interpretation of the value in relation to biological processes.

These gloveboxes exclude oxygen and provide an environment where the integrity of thecore material may be maintained, since many strict anaerobic bacteria are sensitive to oxygen. Strin-gent aseptic precautions not necessary for microcosm construction. It is more important to maintainanaerobic conditions of the aquifer material and solutions added to the microcosm bottles. The microcosms should have approximately the same ratio of solids to water as the in situ aquifer material, with a minimum or negligible headspace. Most bacteria in the subsurface areattached to the aquifer solids. If a microcosm has an excess of water, and the contaminant is prima-rily in the dissolved phase, the bacteria must consume or transform a great deal more contaminant toproduce the same relative change in the contaminant concentration. As a result, the kinetics ofremoval at field scale will be underestimated in the microcosms. A minimum of three replicate microcosms for both living and control treatments should be constructed for each sampling event. Microcosms sacrificed at each sampling interval are preferableto microcosms that are repetitively sampled. The compounds of regulatory interest should be addedat concentrations representative of the higher concentrations found in the geochemical region of theplume being evaluated. The compounds should be added as a concentrated aqueous solution. If anaqueous solution is not feasible, dioxane or acetonitrile may be used as solvents. Avoid carriers thatcan be metabolized anaerobically, particularly alcohols. If possible, use ground water from the siteto prepare dosing solutions and to restore water lost from the core barrel during sample collection. For long-term microcosm studies, autoclaving is the preferred method for sterilization. Nothing available to sterilize core samples works perfectly. Mercuric chloride is excellent for short-termstudies (weeks or months). However, mercuric chloride complexes to clays, and control may be lostas it is sorbed over time. Sodium azide is effective in repressing metabolism of bacteria that havecytochromes, but is not effective on strict anaerobes. The microcosms should be incubated in the dark at the ambient temperature of the aquifer. It is preferable that the microcosms be incubated inverted in an anaerobic glovebox. Anaerobic jars arealso available that maintain an oxygen-free environment for the microcosms. Dry redox indicatorstrips can be placed in the jars to assure that anoxic conditions are maintained. If no anaerobicstorage is available, the inverted microcosms can be immersed in approximately two inches of waterduring incubation. Teflon -lined butyl rubber septa are excellent for excluding oxygen and should be used if the microcosms must be stored outside an anaerobic environment. The studies should last from one year to eighteen months. The residence time of a plume may be several years to tens of years at field scale. Rates of transformation that are slow in terms oflaboratory experimentation may have a considerable environmental significance. A microcosmstudy lasting only a few weeks to months may not have the resolution to detect slow changes that areof environmental significance. Additionally, microcosm studies often distinguish a pattern of se-quential biodegradation of the contaminants of interest and their daughter products. C.3.4.7 Microcosm Interpretation As a practical matter, batch microcosms with an optimal solids/water ratio, that are sampled every two months in triplicate, for up to eighteen months, can resolve biodegradation from abioticlosses with a detection limit of 0.001 to 0.0005 per day. Rates determined from replicated batchmicrocosms are found to more accurately duplicate field rates of natural attenuation than columnstudies. Many plumes show significant attenuation of contamination at field calibrated rates that areslower than the detection limit of microcosms. Although rate constants for modeling purposes aremore appropriately acquired from field-scale studies, it is reassuring when the rates in the field andthe rates in the laboratory agree.C3-55The rates measured in the microcosm study may be faster than the estimated field rate. This may not be due to an error in the laboratory study, particularly if estimation of the field-scale rate ofattenuation did not account for regions of preferential flow in the aquifer. The regions of preferentialflow may be determined by use of a downhole flow meter or by other methods for determininghydraulic conductivity in one- to two-foot sections of the aquifer. Statistical comparisons can determine if removals of contaminants of concern in the living treatments are significantly different from zero or significantly different from any sorption that isoccurring. Comparisons are made on the first-order rate of removal, that is, the slope of a linearregression of the natural logarithm of the concentration remaining against time of incubation for boththe living and control microcosm. These slopes (removal rates) are compared to determine if they aredifferent, and if so, extent of difference that can be detected at a given level of confidence. C.3.4.8 The Tibbetts Road Case Study The Tibbetts Road Superfund Site in Barrington, New Hampshire, a former private home, was used to store drums of various chemicals from 1944 to 1984. The primary ground-water contami-nants in the overburden and bedrock aquifers were benzene and TCE, with respective concentrationsof 7,800 \u00b5g/L and 1,100 \u00b5g/L. High concentrations of arsenic, chromium, nickel, and lead were also found. Material collected at the site was used to construct a microcosm study evaluating the removal of benzene, toluene, and TCE. This material was acquired from the most contaminated source at thesite, the waste pile near the origin of Segment A (Figure C.3.10). Microcosms were incubated fornine months. 20-mL headspace vials, dosed with 1 mL of spikingsolution, capped with a Teflon -lined, gray butyl rubber septa, and sealed with an aluminum crimp cap. Controls were prepared by autoclaving the material used to construct the microcosms over-night. Initial concentrations for benzene, toluene, and TCE were, respectively, 380 \u00b5g/L, 450 \u00b5g/L, and 330 \u00b5g/L. The microcosms were thoroughly mixed by vortexing, then stored inverted in the dark at the ambient temperature of 10\u00b0C. The results (Figures C.3.11, C.3.12, and C.3.13; Table C.3.9) show that significant biodegrada- tion of both petroleum aromatic hydrocarbons and the chlorinated solvent had occurred. Significantremoval in the control microcosms also occurred for all compounds. The data exhibited more variability in the living microcosms than in the control treatment, which is a pattern that has beenobserved in other microcosm studies. The removals observed in the controls are probably due tosorption; however, this study exhibited more sorption than typically seen. The rate constants determined from the microcosm study for the three compounds are shown in Table C.3.10. The appropriate rate constant to be used in a model or a risk assessment would be thefirst-order removal in the living treatment minus the first-order removal in the control, in other wordsthe removal that is in excess of the removal in the controls. The first-order removal in the living and control microcosms was estimated as the linear regres- sion of the natural logarithm of concentration remaining in each microcosm in each treatment againsttime of incubation. Student's t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval. The standard error of the difference of the rates of removal in living andcontrol microcosms was estimated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard errorsof the living and control microcosms, with n-4 degrees of freedom (Glantz, 1992). Table C.3.11 presents the concentrations of organic compounds and their metabolic products in monitoring wells used to define line segments in the aquifer for estimation of field-scale rate con-stants. Wells in this aquifer showed little accumulation of trans-1,2-DCE; 1,1-DCE; vinyl chloride; or ethene, although removals of TCE and cis-1,2-DCE were extensive. This can be explained by the observation (Bradley and Chapelle, 1996) that iron-reducing bacteria can rapidly oxidize vinylchloride to carbon dioxide. Filterable iron accumulated in ground water in this aquifer.C3-56Figure C.3.10 Tibbetts Road study site.328330 326324322320 C B A 200 ft.TIBBETTS ROAD328Waste Pile Ground Water Flow Segment Figure C.3.11 TCE microcosm results.1101001000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Time (Weeks)ug/LTCE Microcosm TCE ControlC3-57Figure C.3.13 Toluene microcosm results.Figure C.3.12 Benzene microcosm results.1101001000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Time (Weeks)ug/LBenzene Microcosm Benzene Control 1101001000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Time (Weeks)ug/LToluene Microcosm Toluene Control\u00b5g/L \u00b5g/LC3-58The extent of attenuation from well to well listed in Table C.3.11, and the travel time between wells in a segment (Figure C.3.4) were used to calculate first-order rate constants for each segment(Table C.3.12). Travel time between monitoring wells was calculated from site-specific estimates ofhydraulic conductivity and from the hydraulic gradient. In the area sampled for the microcosm study,the estimated Darcy flow was 2.0 feet per year. With an estimated porosity in this particular glacialtill of 0.1, this corresponds to a plume velocity of 20 feet per year. C.3.4.9 Summary Table C.3.13 compares the first-order rate constants estimated from the microcosm studies to the rate constants estimated at field scale. The agreement between the independent estimates of rateis good; indicating that the rates can appropriately be used in a risk assessment. The rates of biodeg-radation documented in the microcosm study could easily account for the disappearance of trichloro- ethylene, benzene, and toluene observed at field scale. The rates estimated from the microcosmstudy are several-fold higher than the rates estimated at field scale. This may reflect an underestima-tion of the true rate in the field. The estimates of plume velocity assumed that the aquifer washomogeneous. No attempt was made in this study to correct the estimate of plume velocity for theinfluence of preferential flow paths. Preferential flow paths with a higher hydraulic conductivitythan average would result in a faster velocity of the plume, thus a lower residence time and fasterrate of removal at field scale.Compound Time Z ero Mi c ro c os mTime Zero ControlW eek 23 Mi c ro c os mW eek 23 ControlW eek 42 Mi c ro c os mW eek 42 Control TCE 328 337 1 180 2 36.3 261 394 12.5 116 2 54.5 309 367 8.46 99.9 2 42.3 Mea n \u00b1 Benzene 366 396 201 236 11.1 146 280 462 276 180 20.5 105 340 433 22.8 152 11.6 139 Mea n \u00b1 Standard Deviation329 \u00b1 44.1 430 14.4 \u00b1 5.29 130 \u00b1 21.9 Toluene 443 460 228 254 2 136 342 557 304 185 2.5 92 411 502 19.9 157 16.6 115 Mea n \u00b1 Standard Deviation399 \u00b1 51.6 506 \u00b1 48.6 184 Tibbetts MicrocosmsC3-59Table C.3.10 First-order Rate Constants for Removal of Benzene, the Tibbetts Microcosms Autoclaved Above Removal (per year) TCE 6.31 2.62 3.69 95% Confidence Interval \u00b1 2.50 \u00b1 Rate Significant at Confidence0.99 Table C.3.11 Concentrations of Contaminants and Metabolic By-products in Monitoring Wells along Segments in the Plume used to Estimate Field-scale Rate Constants Parameter Segment A Segment B Segment C Monitoring We l l80S 79S 70S 52S 710 67 710 3.1 10.9 220 270 220 2.9 trans-1,2-DCE <1 10000 <1 3850 900 m-Xylene 2500 <1 360 59 360 <1 p-Xylene 1400 22 1100 320 1100 <1 Ethylbenzene 1300 0.7 760 310 760 <1 Methane 353 77 8 3 8 <2 Iron 27000C3-60Flow Path Segments in Length and Time of Ground-water Travel Segment A 130 feet = 6.5 yearsSegment B 80 feet = 4.0 yearsSegment C 200 feet = 10 years Compound First-order Rate Constants in Segments ( per year) TCE 0.41 0.59 0.54 cis-1,2-DCE Contaminant Attenuation in Segments of the Tibbetts Road Plume Table C.3.13 Comparison of First-order Rate Constants in a Microcosm Study, and in the Field, at the Tibbetts Road NPL Site Parameter M icrocosms Corrected for Cont a ge RateMinimum Rate Significant at 95% ConfidenceSegment A Segment B Segment C -----------------First-order Rate (per year)-------------- Trichloroethylene 3.69 1.38 0.41 "}
