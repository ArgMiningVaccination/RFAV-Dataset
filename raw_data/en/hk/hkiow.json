Abstract In recent years, the use of traditional and complementary medicine methods has gained significant importance worldwide. It is seen that the use of these methods in children is also very widespread. The most commonly used methods in children and adolescents are biological based treatments, mind-body interventions, and manipulative and body-based approaches. The evidence-based nature of these methods used by the parents is of critical importance. Since nurses are the healthcare professionals who work closest to the children, adolescents, and society, they have important tasks and responsibilities for efficient, reli- able, and proper use of applications. In this study, it was aimed to discuss their usage rates, the roles of nurses, and the appropriate and effective use of them by examining the concept of traditional and complementary medicine. Keywords: Child, children's health, nursing, parent, traditional and complementary medicine Introduction Health problems that have increased during the recent years lead individuals to seek various solutions. These solutions range from modern medicine to traditional and com- plementary practices.1 The use of traditional and complementary medicine (TCM) meth- ods has gradually increased in our country as well as all over the world.1-5 Recent studies have shown that the use of TCM is also very common among the children. In the litera- ture, the rate of TCM usage among the children has been reported to range between 10.9% and 93.3% worldwide,3,5-13 and this ratio is found to be higher among the children who suffer from chronic, recurrent, and incurable diseases.3,11,14-16 Traditional and complementary medicine methods include several therapies based on various philosophies, beliefs, assumptions, and practices.2 As new approaches proven to be safe and effective have arisen and integrated into traditional healthcare ser - vices, TCM methods are changing continuously. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), TCM methods are classified under 5 main domains.17,18 Each domain includes several types of therapy.2,17 These domains are classified as \"alternative medical systems\" (traditional Eastern medicine, acupuncture, Ayurveda, naturopathy, homeopathy, and Tibet medicine), \"mind-body therapies\" (medi- tation, yoga, hypnosis, dance, lity) hydrotherapy, reflexology, and other osteopathy treatment methods), and \"energy therapies\" (Reiki, therapeutic touch, and other methods affecting bioelectric field of the body).17 In the Regulation on Traditional and Complementary Medicine Practices that is in force in Turkey (2014), the list of TCM methods, which may be practiced in the unit and appli- cation centers, was defined. These practices were phytotherapy, music therapy.19 According to the Regulation, TCM methods have to be applied by trained and licensed individuals.4,19 Traditional and complementary medicine methods applied by the nurses were found to be divided into 3 groups in the literature. In the first group, there are therapies which are directly carried Cite this article as: Konuk ener D.

They think that TCM methods are natural and, thus, harmless.37,38 The fact that many forms of TCM are easily sold everywhere and that parents can have easy access to such products reinforces their opinion.3,37-39 Prior to using TCM methods, parents should be made aware of the positive/negative effects of these practices, their interactions with medications, and whether they are evidence based or not. Pediatric nurses, who aim to protect and promote the health of children and adolescents, to improve health conditions, and to establish a healthy lifestyle, have significant responsibilities in creating this aware- ness.40,41 In this direction, this current study aimed to examine the concept of TCM and to discuss the most commonly used TCM meth- ods for children and adolescents, their usage rates, and the role of nurses in their proper and effective use. Definitions The concept of TCM has been widely discussed in the scientific lit - erature for a long time and tried to be defined by many research- ers and institutions.3,42,43 However, TCM does not have a universally accepted definition even today; and there is still no consensus on the concepts used in this field.3,9 \"Complementary medicine,\" \"alternative medicine,\" and \"traditional and complementary medicine\" concepts are found to be commonly used in the literature.3,4,16 Moreover, several terms such as natural medicine, folk medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, folkloric medicine, and supportive medicine are also used in various countries and cultures.23,44 Holistic medicine is described as patient-centered care involving consideration of biological, psychological, spiritual, and social and environmental aspects of health. Integrative medicine refers to the examination of a wide variety of treatment options in holistic medi- cine and the selection of practices with proven efficacy and safety.2,45 Integrative medicine adopts patient-centered care approach that takes the patients' values and preferences into account.2 Holistic and integrative medicines are 2 concepts that are closely associated with each other. They are generally used together as integrative/holistic medicine.2,45 Alternative medicine is defined as the use of methods other than sci- entific medical practices. Complementary medicine can be explained as the use of alternative medical products and methods in addition to medical treatment protocols.31,37,46 While complementary medicine describes treatment methods that are used as an adjunct to mod- ern medicine, alternative medicine involves treatment methods that replace modern medicine. These 2 terms are used together under the title of complementary and alternative medicine.37,46 Folkloric medicine (folk medicine and traditional medicine) describes the use of knowledge, skills, and practices based on theories, beliefs, and experiences specific to different cultures in the protection and promotion of health and the treatment of diseases.47 Folkloric medi- cine practices are transferred from generations to generations, and these practices are generally realized by family or community mem- bers.2,47 According to WHO, traditional medicine is defined as a set of practices that are used to maintain health as well as protection from physical and mental diseases, making diagnosis, improvement, or treatment, that are based on theories, beliefs, and experiences spe- cific to different cultures, that can be transferred from generations to generations and that can be used alone or in combination.4,48,49 During recent years, the concept of TCM has come to the forefront in our country as a result of relevant discussions by national and international institutions notably WHO, emphasizing that \"medicine cannot have an alternative; only treatment can have.\"4,44,50 Relevantly, Ministry of Health published \"the Regulation on Traditional and Complementary Medicine Practices\" in October 2014. In this regula- tion, the aim, context, practice and working principles, characteristics of performing healthcare institutions, and the list of TCM practices were explained clearly.19 The Usage Rates of Traditional and Complementary Medicine Methods Among the Children Rapid improvements observed in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases have also been made with an increase in the use of TCM.37 Recent studies have shown that the use of TCM is significantly increased among pediatric populations.3,5-13 It is known that the use of TCM is generally highest among the most vulnerable pediatric popu- lations, including the children especially who have an untreatable and recurrent chronic disease, developmental disability, and special care needs.3,11,14-16 Chronic disease groups that most commonly use TCM rheumatoid arthritis.3,11 It has been reported that the TCM usage rate in these children ranges between 28.0% and 95% and is above 50% on average.3,11,14-16 When TCM usage rates among the outpatient children without any chronic disease were examined, a very wide range was observed. When the results of the relevant research on this subject in differ - ent countries of the world were examined, TCM usage rates among the children and adolescents were found to be 11.6% in the United States,6 in Bahreyn.5 In the systematic review by Italia et al, study results in 19 European countries were examined and TCM usage rate was found to range between 10.9% and 87.6%.10 The studies performed in different centers and years in our coun- try have shown that TCM usage by the parents ranges between 57% and 100%. The rates were reported to be 100% in Antalya and Bandirma.25,34 Previous studies have reported conflicting results on the compari- son of TCM usage rates and sociodemographic characteristics of the parents.2,3,5,6,9,11,14,33 No significant differences were found between 458JERN 2022; 19(4): 456-465 DOI:10.5152/jern.2022.47704Konuk ener Traditional and Complementary Medicine in Children TCM usage based on the age of the parent and the gender of the children.2,11,14 In addition, TCM usage was found to be correlated with the education level of the parent, the income level, and the age of the children. It was also determined that the TCM usage rate was inversely proportional to the age of the children, and usage rate was found to be decreased as the children's age increased.3,5,9,11,14 It has been observed that TCM usage is common among the children smaller than 2 years old, and this ratio is more increased among the infants younger than 1-year-old. Traditional and complementary medicine has been found to be used more commonly, especially in relieving upper respiratory tract infections such as infantile colic, teething pain, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and cough.11 This situation is considered to be derived from the fact that parents may be afraid of the side effects of medications and find TCM methods safer. Moreover, it was reported in the previous studies that parents with a higher education and income level preferred TCM methods more, considered them as effective, and had a high level of satisfaction.6,9,33 This suggests that they have a high level of knowledge about TCM methods and they can easily gain access to the resources. Traditional and Complementary Medicine Methods Most Commonly Used Among the Children The NCCAM reported the most commonly used TCM methods among the infants, children, and adolescents as biologically based therapies, mind-body therapies, and manipulative and body-based methods.17 Similar results have been observed in national and international stud- ies. The most commonly used methods have been identified as vita- mins/minerals, fish oil, and herbal therapies with a special diet and prayer, mind-body therapies such as hypnotherapy, and manipula- tive and body-based approaches using massage, exercise, and cryo- therapy.3,5-9,13,16,23-36 The results of some studies on TCM methods used among the children are shown in Table 1.3,5,7-13,25-36,51-55 Biologically Based Therapies According to the NCCAM, biologically based practices include the use of botanical and animal products, vitamins/minerals, fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, prebiotics, and probiotics, all special diets and functional foods.17,18 Among these, vitamins/minerals constitute the most common TCM method used by the children, and the usage rate has been reported to range between 41% and 85%.6,24,27,30,31,33,34 The most frequently used TCM method among the adolescents was deter - mined to be herbal products and other food supplements.2,6 Biologically based therapies have a long history of traditional use. Together with this, there are concerns about the side effects of herbal products and food supplements.2,11,21 The ingredients of some herbal products and supplements may cause negative interactions when used together with medications and medical therapies.16,21 The efficacy and reliability of most herbal products have not been proven yet. The lack of evidence does not mean that the activity of herbal medications is poor or insecure, but rigorous clinical studies have not been performed for some biological products yet.11 Besides, there are numerous products in the market which were licensed by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock under the name of \"sup- portive food\" or \"food supplement\" without the approval of Ministry of Health in our country. These products may cause serious side effects and health problems since they include chemicals in different derivatives.56 The use of dietary supplements among the children with several health problems, including asthma, upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, stress, anxiety, depression, and atten tion- defic Evidence-based stud- ies are going on, and the literature is expanding rapidly. According to the results, the products with proven safety can be incorporated into medical treatments.2,14 For instance, the use of probiotics was approved as a complementary practice in the mid-1990s, whereas it has become a medical practice in the 21st century since many gastro- enterologists recommend their daily use in the children with inflam- matory bowel disease.2 Vitamins and minerals, which are the mostly used biologically based therapies among the children (41%-85%), have significant effects in the maintenance of biochemical and vital functions, in the regula- tion of energy metabolism, in boosting immune system, and in the development of bone and teeth structure.6,24,27,30,31,35 Vitamins are classified as fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and water-soluble vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, magnesium, phospor, sodium, potas- sium, and chlorine) and microminerals (iron, zinc, iodine, selenium, copper, manganese, fluorine, chromium, and molybdenum).58 All bio- chemical and physiological processes in the body may be lacking, the functions of other interacting micro and macronutrients may be impaired, and some associated clinical pathologies may be observed in the absence of vitamins and minerals.35,58 Together with this, unnecessary and high-dose use of vitamins and minerals may lead to toxic effects in the body due to the overstimulation of the immune system.35 Omega-3 fatty acids, which are obtained from fish oil such as eicosa- panthenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA), are commonly used all over the world as an important dietary supplement for chil- dren.59 In the previous studies, fish oil usage rates among the children were found to range between 7.2% and 11.6%.6,30,57 Eicosapanthenoic acid and DHA have significant physiological functions in the main- tenance of human metabolism and health.57 It is known that EPA has effects such as reducing blood clotting, decreasing blood pres- sure, and preventing sudden heart attack. Docosahexanoic acid is an essential food for the growth and development of children. In the literature, DHA has been reported to support the development of cen- tral nervous system and brain, to boost immune system, and to have an important role in the formation and function of retina.57,59,60 Echinacea, which is another botanical commonly used in children worldwide, was first used by American Indians and then was spread across Europe.14 Echinacea plant is known to increase leukocyte count, to boost immune system, and has antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. Previous studies have also shown that echinacea has positive effects in case of lower and upper respiratory tract infections (cold, flu, tonsillitis, otitis media, asthma, pneumo- nia, and tuberculosis), oral and gingival diseases, vaginal infections, sleep problems, and stress and anxiety disorders.14,26,51 However, it was also reported that gastrointestinal and skin reactions might be seen among the children with autoimmune and allergic diseases in echinacea use.14 Mind-Body Therapies Mind-body therapies benefit from the methods allowing mind to affect body functions.14 Mind-body therapies, which are recom- mended by the NCCAM, include various practices such as meditation, guided imagery, dreaming, tai chi, qigong, yoga, prayer, hypnosis, 459Konuk ener Traditional and Complementary Medicine in Children Table 1.

Sex, parental education, and having an orthodox medical personal physician were not associated with utilization Gleberzon B, Arts J, Mei A, McManus EL.55 (2012).It was aimed to conduct a search of the literature between 2007 and 2011 investigating the use of SMT for pediatric health conditions and to perform a systematic review of eligible retrieved clinical trialsSystematic review Two electronic databases (Index to Chiropractic Literature and PubMed) n=16 eligible studiesIt was found that chiropractic treatment has positive outcomes in alleviating the symptoms of colic, asthma, enuresis, and constipation AMED, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database; AR, adverse reaction; natural SMP, spinal manipulative therapy; TCM, Traditional and Complementary Medicine.Table 1. Studies on TCM Methods Used in Children (Continued)463Konuk ener Traditional and Complementary Medicine in Children Prayer, that is among spiritual needs, is the most commonly used mind-body therapy all over the world.5,29,33,36 Embracing the power of belief and praying are the coping methods used by the parents in case that their children get sick. Previous studies have determined that spiritual/religious beliefs and practices decrease stress and anxiety, enhance physiological, psychological, and mental well-being, and strengthen the immune system.2,5,36 Recent studies have shown that 35%-99% of the parents pray for the treatment of their chil- dren.5,29,36 In addition to this, parents do not see spiritual practices as an alternative to medical treatment; they see them as a personal practice complementary to medical care.2,36 Hypnotherapy is a method encouraging the use of imagination to protect, improve, and promote the health of the children. Children and adolescents have a high tendency for hypnosis since they can be hypnotized quickly and deepened easily.61 Previous studies have reported that hypnotherapy is most effective between 6 and 10 years old.2,61 Hypnosis, biofeedback, and guided imagery have been shown to be effective methods that can be used as an adjunct to the medi- cal treatment in common health problems such as acute and chronic pain, stress and anxiety disorders, enuresis, encopresis, sleep dis- orders, thumb-sucking, autoimmune nervous system disorder, atten- tion-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, learning difficulty, asthma, cancer, and diabetes.2,14,61 Manipulative and Body-Based Methods These methods involve the manipulation of one or more parts of the body (manual therapy).14 According to the definition by the NCCAM, manipulative and body-based practices involve massage therapy, chiropractic, reflexology, acupressure, technique, and Trager approach.2,17,18 Massage is the most common manipulative practice used in children, and it can be performed by the parents at home and by licensed mas- sage therapists and nurses at clinical environment. Previous stud- ies reported its usage rate among the children between 39.1% and 66.9%.16,24,33 It is known that massage boosts the immune system, increases blood and lymphatic circulation, provides the elimination of toxic materials from the body, improves the volume and capacity of the lungs, reduces the muscle tension, and provides relaxation and relief.2,14 Today, massage is a routine practice used in many neonatal intensive care units in order to support the growth and development of premature infants, to regulate their vital findings, and to reduce nosocomial infections.2,16,52,62 There are studies showing that mas- sage that is regularly applied to the children by the parents before sleep decreases stress and anxiety and improves respiratory func- tions.39,63,64 Moreover, previous studies have determined that mas- sage is effective in alleviating the symptoms of asthma,2 insomnia,26 colic,2,16 cystic fibrosis,2 and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.2 Chiropractic treatment is one of the most common TCM meth- ods that is professionally used for children.53-54 This method focuses on the relationship between the body structure (notably spine struc- ture) and body function and how this relationship affects health. Literature data have shown that its usage rate among the children ranges between 3.0% and 20.3%.24,53,54 Chiropractic is a method used to relieve especially muscle and joint pain in children.54-55 Recent studies have shown that chiropractic treatment has positive out - comes in alleviating the symptoms of asthma, enuresis, constipation, infantile colic, fatigue, stress, and anxiety.53-55 Together with this, it should be applied by a healthcare professional in order not to see any side effects following the treatment.2 The Role of Nurses in the Use of Traditional and Complementary Medicine Methods Pediatric nurses have significant roles and responsibilities in the pro- tection and promotion of health, prevention of diseases, and main- tenance of a healthy lifestyle.41 Nurses take on important duties in effective, reliable, and proper use of TCM practices since they are healthcare professionals who work most closely with children, ado- lescents, and society.37,41 The prerequisite of bringing children and parents a necessary, adequate, and effective service for the nurses is to know sociocultural characteristics of the group to be served and health-disease practices, and this is important to improve the qual- ity of the service to be given. Nurses have the opportunity to detect healthcare needs and practices easily since they have a continuous communication and interaction with children/parents.37 There are important points to consider while communicating with parents. Firstly, child and the family should be listened actively by considering the principles of family-centered care. Respect should be given to the perspective, values, and cultural beliefs of the fam- ily. It is required to accept the family as a member of the team and act together while using TCM methods.65 Care should be taken to establish a non-judgmental communication between the parents and healthcare professionals. Lack of informing the parents and lack of taking their thoughts into account may affect the communication in a negative way while investigating treatment options. This situation may lead parents to take risks for unsafe treatment options and to discontinue necessary medical treatments.37 Most of the parents use TCM methods in line with the recommenda- tions of their relatives and friends beyond the advice of healthcare professionals; and they avoid to inform them since many families believe that TCM practices are not related to the interest or exper - tise of healthcare professionals.2 Pediatric nurses should collect data continuously about different treatment methods used by the parents. These data are necessary to evaluate positive or negative effects in the treatment of child and to make a proper consultation.2,14,65 Data should be collected by sampling. For instance, it may be asked as \"if the child uses any vitamins, herbs, supplements, tea, home medica- tions, massage, chiropractic, acupuncture or other methods\" instead of asking whether \"he/she uses any alternative treatment or not.\" It is also helpful to ask how the child or adolescent manages stress. These examples may include \"exercise, prayer, music or speaking with friends/trustworthy adults.\"65 Nurses have to be knowledgeable about and equipped with the ben- efits/side effects, application methods, and contraindications of TCM methods in order to provide a suitable training and consultation service.2,65 The current literature on TCM practices should be exam- ined and evidence-based studies should be followed.14,65 The safety and effectiveness of the methods used by the parents should also be known.2,14,65 The responses given by the children to TCM methods should be monitored, and measurable results should be determined for evaluation. Specific goals such as \"relieving the symptoms\" may be set to determine measurable results.14,65 Unreliable TCM methods may lead to physical damage and may bring extra emotional and eco- nomic burden to the families.2,14,65 Therefore, 464JERN 2022; 19(4): DOI:10.5152/jern.2022.47704Konuk ener Traditional and Complementary Medicine in Children harm,\" which is the priority aim, should be in the center of all clinical practices.65 However, it should be kept in mind that even the most innocent TCM practices may have adverse effects, and all family members, especially mothers, should be educated about these meth- ods and their possible effects.29 Conclusion It has been known that the use of TCM in children has gradually increased all over the world and gained importance in medical, eco- nomic, and social aspects in recent years. The most commonly used TCM methods in children and adolescents appear to be biologically based therapies, mind-body therapies, and manipulative and body- based methods. Vitamins/minerals, fish oil, massage therapy, chi- ropractic, prayer, and hypnotherapy appear to be prominent among these methods. Since some TCM practices may have adverse effects and may interact with medications, these methods should be based on evidence. It is recommended to plan services for giving an emphasis on scientific studies that would provide evidence in this field, plan studies exam- ining the effects and side effects of TCM methods, determine and support successful methods, ban the use of harmful methods, and include TCM practices in the nursing curriculum.
