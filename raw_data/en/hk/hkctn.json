The rabies virus enters the body through a cut, scratch, or bite, or through the mouth or eyes. It travels to the central nervous system. Once the virus reaches the brain, it travels into the nerves and grows in different organs. The rabies virus is spread through an infected animal's saliva. It can pass between animals through biting. It can also pass through scratching, as many animals lick their claws. A child may get rabies if they are bitten or scratched by an animal with rabies. The virus can also be spread if a child has scratches or sores that are licked by an infected animal. Rabies can also spread if a child touches their mouth or eyes with hands that have saliva of an infected animal. Which children are at risk for rabies?
