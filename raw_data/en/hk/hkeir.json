A medicinal root used to prevent colds and boost energy By Megan Nunn, PharmD Updated on June 01, 2023 Medically reviewed by Suzanne Fisher, MS, RD, LDN Print Verywell / Anastasia Tretiak Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Types Uses Side Effects Precautions Dosage Drug Interactions Sources Similar Supplements Summary FAQ American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a plant native to North America that is used in herbal medicine. A member of the ivy family, American ginseng roots are available whole and can also be found in dietary supplements and teas. American ginseng is considered an adaptogen which some people claim can help the body overcome physical or emotional stress. American ginseng also has strong antioxidant properties which may protect against cell damage. When used as a supplement, there is some evidence that American ginseng can help lower blood sugar, improve fatigue, and reduce the duration of colds and flu. This article discusses the potential uses and benefits of American ginseng. It also lists possible side effects, interactions, and recommended dosages. Supplement Facts Active ingredient(s): Ginsenosides, polysaccharides, terpenes, phenolic compounds, amino acids, flavonoids, volatile oils, vitamins, and minerals Alternate name(s): Baie Rouge, Canadian ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, red berry Legal status: Sold over the counter (OTC) in the United States Suggested dose: 200 to 400 milligrams twice a day for up to six months Safety considerations: Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding or for people with hormone-sensitive cancers; may affect blood sugar, cause insomnia Types of American Ginseng American ginseng is a distinctive type of ginseng used in traditional Chinese medicine. American ginseng and Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) are both considered true ginseng in that they contain an organic chemical called ginsenoside. Even so, American ginseng has a different chemical makeup and \"cooler\" yin qualities than Asian ginseng. It is also less stimulating. Because of this, American ginseng is widely exported to Asia where it is highly valued for its cooling and sedative effects. Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) is not a true ginseng, It is a small, woody shrub with blackberry-like fruit found in northeastern Asia. While it is also used in traditional Chinese medicine, neither the berries, leaves, stalks, nor roots contain ginsenoside. Uses of American Ginseng The evidence supporting the health benefits of American ginseng is limited, most of which comes from lab and animal studies. Human trials are lacking. With that said, a growing body of research suggests that American ginseng may be beneficial in the treatment of fatigue, poor memory, diabetes, and viral respiratory infections like colds and flu. Fatigue A 2018 review of four studies suggests that American ginseng may help relieve fatigue caused by chronic illnesses ranging from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) to cancer. The most significant benefit was seen in people who took 2,000 milligrams (mg) daily for eight weeks. Similar results were seen in a 2019 review examing the effects of American ginseng on people with cancer-related fatigue. In this study, the benefit was greatest in people undergoing active treatment, like chemotherapy or radiation. As an added bonus, American ginseng does not interact with commonly prescribed chemotherapy drugs like tamoxifen, doxorubicin, methotrexate, or fluorouracil. Memory Limited evidence suggests that American ginseng may improve cognitive function in some people. This includes the ability to learn, think, reason, and remember. A 2015 study reported that healthy adults who received a single 200 mg dose of an American ginseng extract (called Cereboost) had increased working memory, peaking within three hours of the dose. The findings were limited by the small size of the study (52 adults) and the lack of a control group (meaning a group given a sham placebo). A 2022 study involving 61 adults showed longer-lasting improvements in working memory after taking 200 mg of Cereboost daily for two weeks. For this study, a control group was included, but the findings were limited by the fact that the research was funded by the manufacturer, Naturex SA. An unrelated study published in 2012 reported that an American ginseng extract taken twice daily for four weeks improved the working memory of 32 people with schizophrenia compared to a matched set of adults given a placebo. Diabetes A 2014 review of 16 ginseng trials concluded that the fasting blood sugar was modestly lowered by taking ginseng. Three of the 16 studies looked at American ginseng specifically. A 2019 study involving 24 adults with well-controlled type 2 diabetes showed that a 3,000 mg dose of American ginseng taken daily helped control blood sugar. At the end of the eight-week study, the people given American ginseng had lower hemoglobin A1C levels, fasting blood sugar, and systolic blood pressure than those given a placebo. The findings were limited by the fact that the participants' blood sugar was already controlled by medications. At present, there is no evidence that ginseng is able to manage diabetes on its own. Effects of Ginseng on Blood Sugar Cold and Flu According to a 2017 review of studies in the Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, American ginseng may offer protection against common viral respiratory infections like colds and flu. This supported earlier research in which American ginseng appeared to reduce the risk and duration of colds and flu in older adults with weakened immune systems. A 2020 analysis published in Complementary Therapy and Medicine suggested that American ginseng may help prevent or treat seasonal respiratory infections in some people, but that the evidence wasn't strong enough to offer a clear conclusion. Additional Uses Preliminary studies have investigated American ginseng for the following conditions: Alzheimer's disease Ischemic stroke Heart failure Having obesity Cancer The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved American ginseng for use in treating or preventing any medical condition. Ginseng should not be used in place of medications prescribed for you by your healthcare provider. What Are the Side Effects of American Ginseng? American ginseng is generally regarded as safe. In clinical trials, doses of 2,000 mg daily were well-tolerated and had the same rate of side effects as a placebo. Possible side effects include: Nausea Insomnia Headache Rash Flu-like symptoms Low blood sugar Diarrhea Vaginal bleeding Breast pain The long-term side effects of ginseng use aren't known. Precautions Some groups of people should take special precautions when using American ginseng and may need to avoid it altogether. These include conditions like: Pregnancy and breastfeeding: American ginseng contains ginsenoside, a chemical linked to birth defects in animals. It is unknown if taking American ginseng while nursing is safe. Estrogen-sensitive conditions: Conditions like breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids may be worsened because ginsenoside has estrogen-like activity. Insomnia: High doses of American ginseng may cause difficulty sleeping. Schizophrenia: High doses of American ginseng can increase agitation in people with schizophrenia. Surgery: American ginseng should be stopped two weeks before surgery due to its impact on blood sugar. Dosage: How Much American Ginseng Should I Take? There is no recommended dosage of American ginseng in any form. Never exceed the recommended dosage on the product label, or ask your healthcare provider for advice. American ginseng has been studied at the following dosages: Adults: 200 to 400 mg by mouth twice daily for three to six monthsChildren age 3 to 12: 4.5 to 26 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) by mouth daily for three days At these doses, American ginseng is unlikely to cause toxicity. At higher doses\u2014typically 15 grams (1,500 mg) or more per day\u2014some people develop \"ginseng abuse syndrome\" characterized by diarrhea, dizziness, skin rash, heart palpitations, and depression. Drug Interactions American ginseng may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medications and supplements. These include: Coumadin (warfarin): American ginseng may reduce the blood thinner's effectiveness and increase the risk of blood clotting. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Combining American (selegiline) and Parnate (tranylcypromine) can cause anxiety, restlessness, manic episodes, or trouble sleeping. Diabetes medications: American ginseng can cause blood sugar to drop excessively when taken with insulin or other diabetes drugs, leading to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Progestins: The side effects of the synthetic form of progesterone can be increased if taken with American ginseng. Herbal supplements: Some herbal remedies can also lower blood sugar when combined with American ginseng, including aloe, cinnamon, chromium, vitamin D, and magnesium. To avoid interactions, tell your healthcare provider if you intend to use any supplement. Sources of American Ginseng American ginseng is an ingredient found in many commercial food products in the United States. It can also be purchased online or in stores in supplement form. Verywell / Anastasia Tretiak American ginseng is used as an additive in some energy drinks and ginger candies. There are also American ginseng teas sold in grocery stores, supplements stores, and health food shops. Whole dried root and granulated ginseng root can also be used to make teas and tonics. As a supplement, American ginseng is available as a tablet, capsule, powder, extract, or tincture. Tablets and capsules may be better options than whole root ginseng as you can control the dose. Store ginseng tea, supplements, and dried root in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. Keep away from children and pets. Discard after one year or by the expiration date on the product label. How to Choose Supplements Dietary supplements are not strictly regulated in the United States, To ensure quality, choose supplements that have been voluntarily submitted for testing by an independent certifying body like U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.Certification does mean that the supplement works or is inherently safe. It simply means that no contaminants were found and that the product contains the ingredients listed on the product label in the correct amounts. Similar Supplements Some other supplements that may improve cognitive function and decrease stress are: (Mentha spicata) Supplements that have been studied for the treatment or prevention of respiratory viruses like the cold or flu include: Bai Shao Zinc Vitamin D Honey Nigella Summary Limited evidence suggests that American ginseng may help improve fatigue, mental function, diabetes, and respiratory infections like the cold and flu. Side effects and drug interactions are possible, and American ginseng can be dangerous if taken during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or in people with schizophrenia or certain cancers. In some cases, integrative medicine shouldn't be a substitute for standard medical care. Use first-line treatments, and discuss with your healthcare provider about adding alternatives like American ginseng and other herbal remedies.
