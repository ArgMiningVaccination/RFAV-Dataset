The performance of models depends on the accuracy of forcing inputs and model parameters. We developed an improved approach to the parameterization of the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model using the Forcing and Normalizing Operation (FANO). SSEBop has two key model parameters that define the model boundary conditions. The FANO algorithm computes the wet-bulb boundary condition using a linear FANO Equation relating surface temperature, surface psychrometric constant, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The FANO parameterization was implemented on two computing platforms using Landsat and gridded meteorological datasets: (1) Google Earth Engine (GEE) and (2) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Science Processing Architecture (ESPA). Evaluation was conducted by comparing modeled actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates with AmeriFlux eddy covariance (EC) and water balance ETa from level-8 Hydrologic Unit Code sub-basins in the conterminous United States. FANO brought substantial improvements in model accuracy and operational implementation. Compared to the earlier version (v0.1.7), SSEBop FANO (v0.2.6) reduced grassland bias from 47% to 2% while maintaining comparable bias for croplands (11% versus 7%) against EC data. A water balance-based ETa bias evaluation showed an overall improvement from 7% to 1%. Climatology versus annual gridded reference evapotranspiration (ETr) produced comparable ETa results, justifying the use of climatology ETr for the global SSEBop Landsat ETa that is accessible through the ESPA website. Besides improvements in model accuracy, SSEBop FANO increases the spatiotemporal coverage of ET modeling due to the elimination of high NDVI requirements for model parameterization. Because of the existence of potential biases from forcing inputs and model parameters, continued evaluation and bias corrections are necessary to improve the absolute magnitude of ETa for localized water budget applications.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Improving the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Evapotranspiration Model Using the Forcing and process-based models mass balance approaches [ [7](#B7-remotesensing-15-00260), [8](#B8-remotesensing-15-00260), [9](#B9-remotesensing-15-00260), [10](#B10-remotesensing-15-00260)] used by prognostic hydrologic/biophysical models or full energy balance approaches used by diagnostic ET models [ [11](#B11-remotesensing-15-00260), [12](#B12-remotesensing-15-00260), [13](#B13-remotesensing-15-00260), [14](#B14-remotesensing-15-00260)]. Models require the estimation of parameters whose level of complexity tends to increase from parametric- to process-based models [ [15](#B15-remotesensing-15-00260)]. Depending on the modeling principles, parameters generally define model boundary conditions, control flux rates, or storage terms. With a growing interest for global field-scale ETa within a time scale of agro-climatic decision-making processes in agriculture and water resources, ETa modelers are expected to produce accurate, consistent, and useful ET datasets. Modelers are continuously updating their models for accuracy and computational efficiency as new input datasets, techniques, or model parameterization schemes become available. [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)]. SSEBop is being used for field-scale and basin-wide estimation of ETa along for updating historical records (e.g., Senay et al. [ [17](#B17-remotesensing-15-00260), [18](#B18-remotesensing-15-00260)], Schauer and Senay [ [19](#B19-remotesensing-15-00260)]). SSEBop is a parametric energy balance-based model that treats actual ET as a product of two independently estimated quantities: (1) ET fraction (ETf) and (2) the maximum ET under water-unlimited environmental conditions (Equation (1)): [6](#B6-remotesensing-15-00260)], expressed as: [15](#B15-remotesensing-15-00260)]; Ts is the dry-bulb surface temperature (K) derived from the satellite thermal infrared band, and Tc is the wet-bulb reference surface temperature (K) limit; The constant 1 represents the ET fraction value during maximum ETa, i.e., when Ts = Tc. [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)] and is available for the globe [ [17](#B17-remotesensing-15-00260)]. [18](#B18-remotesensing-15-00260)]; Senay [ [6](#B6-remotesensing-15-00260)]). Although this approach worked adequately for images with sufficient calibration points (high NDVI), there were at least three major limitations: (1) high NDVI images that meet the NDVI > 0.7 criterion may not be available in arid and semi-arid regions or outside of major growing seasons in different parts of the world, (2) high NDVI calibration landscapes are not uniformly distributed in a given image, thus extrapolating Tc to the entire image from isolated calibration points could introduce errors in hydro-climatically complex regions, and (3) the NDVI threshold could create widely varying Tc ranges because some images may only have a narrow range of NDVI that is closer to the threshold (NDVI = 0.7) while others may have Tc values derived from pixels with NDVI far higher than the 0.7 threshold (e.g., NDVI = 0.9). The difference in Ts between NDVI 0.7 and 0.9 could be as high as 4 to 5 K [ [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)]. 2. Methods 2.1. Auxiliary Data [17](#B17-remotesensing-15-00260)]. The maximum air temperature is the 1981-2010 climatological normal (30-year daily mean) and is a combination of two datasets: Daymet Version 4 for North America and CHELSA Version 2 for the globe outside of North America [ [19](#B19-remotesensing-15-00260), [20](#B20-remotesensing-15-00260)]. Both the dT and Ta datasets are at 1 km resolution. The ETr is also a 1981-2010 climatological normal but is a fusion of different model assimilated products. [21](#B21-remotesensing-15-00260)]. The Gridmet ETr is at 4 km resolution in CONUS. For areas outside of CONUS, coarser resolution (refined to 12 km) ETr is utilized, which is derived from the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) data and processed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Physical Sciences Laboratory [ [22](#B22-remotesensing-15-00260)]. The MERRA-2 ETr was scaled to match the relative magnitudes of Gridmet by utilizing the WorldClim Version 3 Potential Evapotranspiration dataset (ETr). The WorldClim Version 3 ETr is a climatological dataset from 1970-2000. Terrestrial ecoregions for 2017 from the One Earth/RESOLVE organization were used to scale the ETr [ [23](#B23-remotesensing-15-00260), [24](#B24-remotesensing-15-00260)]. These datasets were combined to determine a daily global ETr dataset with Gridmet ETr over CONUS and MERRA-2 ETr for all areas outside CONUS. The areas outside of CONUS were scaled for each ecoregion, smoothed, and resampled to 1 km resolution [ [25](#B25-remotesensing-15-00260)]. 2.2. FANO Illustration: Data and Development [6](#B6-remotesensing-15-00260)]; f is a proportionality \"FANO\" constant formulated in this study that relates the ratio Ts*/dT* to NDVI*. The negative sign indicates the known inverse relation between Ts and NDVI, which translates into a smaller Ts at high NDVI and a larger Ts at surfaces. 2.2.1. Study Area [Figure 1](#remotesensing-15-00260-f001)and [Figure 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-f002)). It is important to note that the form of the FANO formulation (Equation (3)) is theoretical and thus not tied to the empirical data from the study site. The lack of observed data from multiple sites should only affect the determination of the magnitude of f and its variability in space and time, which requires an independent study. [Figure 1](#remotesensing-15-00260-f001)), was used for Ts and NDVI. The image was chosen due to various levels of irrigation and vegetation condition to have a good range of NDVI and Ts distribution. To keep the effect of elevation on Ts to the minimum level, we used a digital elevation model (DEM) [ [26](#B26-remotesensing-15-00260)] to sample NDVI and Ts within a relatively narrow range of elevation between 1200 m and 1500 m. The temperature difference dT (25.25 K) for the same day was extracted for the study area from the global dT dataset [ [17](#B17-remotesensing-15-00260)]. [Table 1](#remotesensing-15-00260-t001)). The maximum NDVI associated with the wet-bulb Ts was set to be 0.9 when using surface reflectance-based NDVI. The derivation of the change in NDVI (NDVI*) and the normalization of change in Ts using dT (i.e., Ts*/dT*) is described below. [Table 1](#remotesensing-15-00260-t001)). This ensures a reliable average value for NDVI and Ts regardless of differences in the number of pixels among the different NDVI bins. The average NDVI ranged from 0.11 in the lowest bin to 0.89 in the highest bin with the corresponding Ts* varying from 327.5 K to 302.2 K yielding a difference of 25.3 K between the extreme NDVI bins. This observed Ts difference between the low and high NDVI locations within the study site ( [Figure 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-f002)) is coincidentally very close to the theoretically derived dT value of 25.26 K ( [Table 1](#remotesensing-15-00260-t001)). [Figure 3](#remotesensing-15-00260-f003)shows the temporal variability of dT for the study site with a peak (~25 K) in the summer and a minimum in the winter (~7 K). [Figure 4](#remotesensing-15-00260-f004)illustrates the strong inverse linear relation between Ts*/dT* and NDVI* created using an NDVImax = 0.9 and dT = 25.25 K. The FANO constant f is shown to be 1.23 in this example. However, f is expected to vary among samples (exploratory analysis shows a possible range between 1.10 and 1.40), but an average value of 1.25 is expected to provide a reasonable estimate for general and operational applications. The difference between f = 1.25 and f = 1.10 or between f = 1.25 and f = 1.40 is expected to result in an absolute error of 2 K in the estimation of Tc at low NDVI (0.3) landscapes or only an error of 1 K at high NDVI (0.6) landscapes, which is close to the uncertainty of the Land Surface Temperature and its effect on ETa estimation is relatively small. [Figure 4](#remotesensing-15-00260-f004), the normalized Ts difference (Ts* /dT*) is expected to be 0.0 when the average NDVI is 0.9 because the maximum NDVI is expected to be 0.9. In the SSEBop formulation, Ts*/dT* is the same as 1.0ETf or simply the sensible heat fraction, Hf, in which case a minimum Hf (0.0) and maximum ETf (1.0) is attained at NDVI* = 0.9. For example, at NDVI* = 0.1, NDVI* is 0.8 which translates to Ts*/dT* = 0.98 using the y = 1.23x Equation in [Figure 4](#remotesensing-15-00260-f004). Thus, Hf is high, close to 1.0, which indicates a negligible ETf around 0.02. 2.2.2. Forcing Operation in FANO: Tc Determination [18](#B18-remotesensing-15-00260)]. 2.2.3. Normalizing Operation in FANO: Parameter and Spatial Scale [27](#B27-remotesensing-15-00260)] to identify \"wet\" (surface water and/or wetlands) pixels and remove these pixels from the averaging (see \"Wet Mask\" in [Figure 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-f005)). In each 5 km \u00d7 5 km grid, if more than 10% of the pixels are identified as wet, the averaging is conducted over a much larger area at 100 km \u00d7 100 km after excluding the wet pixels (see [Table 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-t002)). This procedure is particularly important over expansive coastal wetlands and rice growing regions. The larger area window increases the opportunity to find an adequate number of non-wet pixels to be used for the determination of Tc* with FANO. [Figure 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-f005)illustrates how the different inputs (Ts, NDVI, dT, and Ta) are filtered, averaged, and ultimately applied to the FANO Equation to determine Tc*. However, certain conditions, such as low NDVI associated with low Ts* from water bodies and wetlands or high NDVI above the NDVI value of 0.9 require Ts values that have not been adjusted via the FANO Equation. The assumption here is that these are already representative of the wet-bulb condition and that Tc* should be determined using an un-adjusted Ts*. Referring to [Table 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-t002), we note that 5 km pixels that correspond to surface water conditions (NDVI* < 0) are assigned Ts* that does not mask out the water pixels. This is a wet-bulb condition; therefore, masking is not necessary. Conditions where NDVI* > 0.9 (average over 5 km \u00d7 5 km) are exceedingly rare. However, if that is encountered, the pixels are assigned a Ts* that is not modified by the FANO Equation, but it is masked for water pixels. This also amounts to a wet-bulb condition. For these conditions ( [Table 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-t002)), Ts* values are assigned to the final Tc* grid. All other pixels return Tc* derived from Ts* that is calculated using the FANO Equation. [Table 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-t002)shows wet-bulb temperatures applied at coarse scales for various conditions. Each condition in [Table 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-t002)is listed in descending order based on the associated NDVI (and percentages of wet pixels) that define it. Areas with substantial green vegetation (NDVI* > 0.9) or surface water/wet (NDVI* < 0) are assigned a wet-bulb temperature of the average Ts of all the pixels in a 5 km grid. The layers of Tc* are mosaicked together based on \"priority\" (\"a\" is highest priority and \"d\" is lowest). [Table 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-t002)ensures that pixels that are already representative of wet-bulb conditions do not require the use of the FANO Equation. All other conditions are subject to the FANO Equation to produce a continuous and dynamic field of area-averaged (5 km) wet-bulb temperature, Tc*. 2.2.4. Calculation of c Factor [15](#B15-remotesensing-15-00260), [18](#B18-remotesensing-15-00260)]. The disaggregation is generally useful in complex topography where the Tc may show a substantial spatial variation within a 5 km grid. 2.3. Model Performance Evaluation 2.3.1. Water Balance Evaluation [28](#B28-remotesensing-15-00260)] was compared with SSEBop ETa at the water-year (1 October-30 September) timestep. The water-year scale minimizes the effect of unaccounted storage changes that are important at shorter time scales. The water-year, hereafter named as annual WBET for HUC8s, was computed as: [29](#B29-remotesensing-15-00260)]. Monthly P was aggregated to annual totals to obtain a single basin-average value for each HUC8. Annual Q for HUC8s was obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) WaterWatch ( [https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/](https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/), accessed on 20 June 2022). These annual Q values (non-spatial) at the HUC8 scale are generated from historical flow observations at the USGS stream gages, drainage basin boundaries of the stream gages, and the HUC8 boundaries [ [30](#B30-remotesensing-15-00260)]. Following previous studies [ [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260), [31](#B31-remotesensing-15-00260), [32](#B32-remotesensing-15-00260)], the annual storage change (S) was assumed to be negligible (0.0) during the study period. [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260), [33](#B33-remotesensing-15-00260), [34](#B34-remotesensing-15-00260)], several filters were applied to exclude HUC8s where the water balance is not expected to close (WBET P Q). The HUC8s with Q/P > 0.40 [ [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)], HUC8s with WBET greater than potential ET, and HUC8s with SSEBop ETa greater than precipitation (heavily irrigated HUC8s that the ETa from WBET does not consider) were excluded. [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260), [35](#B35-remotesensing-15-00260)] and SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) were compared with WBET for average and individual years during the 5-year (2009, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018) period. These years were selected to include both wet (2016), dry (2011), and normal (2009, 2013, 2018) years. The 5-year average ETa comparisons were also grouped across six different hydro-climatic regions of the CONUS to evaluate the performance of the FANO across the regions. The correlation coefficient (r), bias, MAE (mean absolute error), and RMSE (root mean square error) were applied for statistical analysis. 2.3.2. Evaluation with Flux Tower Data [35](#B35-remotesensing-15-00260)] and Senay et al. [ [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)], the accuracy of the SSEBop ETa using the new FANO implementation was evaluated with eddy covariance (EC) flux tower data from the Ameriflux network ( [https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/), accessed on 15 March 2022). For this evaluation, 23 Ameriflux EC towers were selected in a northeast-southwest swath across the central United States for three consecutive years from each tower for the 2008-2019 period ( [Figure 1](#remotesensing-15-00260-f001)). [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)], rather than using the FLUXNET2015 dataset, which ends before the year 2015, we used the flux-data-qaqc Python package for Energy Balance Closure and Post-Processing of the Ameriflux EC data [ [36](#B36-remotesensing-15-00260)]. This Python package quantifies and standardizes the gap-filling and energy balance closure more efficiently and more uniformly than previous methods using an Energy Balance Ratio approach. The flux-data-qaqc package processes daily actual ET in mm/day, which was matched with the corresponding overpass SSEBop Landsat ETa and the comparison was conducted at the overpass level for a three-year period at each tower location. [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260), [18](#B18-remotesensing-15-00260)], and (2) for the newly developed FANO parameterization of c factor (v0.2.6) described above. To calculate actual ET from the SSEBop ET fraction, two versions of the alfalfa-reference ET (ETr) from the Gridmet dataset were used to calculate ETa: (1) a climatology daily mean of 1981-2010 Gridmet ETr, and (2) using the corresponding original annual (yearly) Gridmet ETr for each overpass date. This resulted in four versions (two model versions by two reference ETr) of SSEBop ETa at the overpass level that were compared to the ETa derived from the EC tower data. [https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/kimberly-research-and-extension-center/research/water-resources/ref-et-software](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/kimberly-research-and-extension-center/research/water-resources/ref-et-software), accessed on 14 May 2022). Both the climatology and annual daily values of Gridmet ETr at each tower location were compared to the ETr derived from the Ref-ET software from the EC tower for the matching years of the EC tower validation study. No scaling factors were used for the climatology or annual Gridmet ETr in order to determine the bias and error in ETr from the model-assimilated gridded Gridmet dataset against the station-based EC tower ETr. 2.4. Computing Platforms 2.4.1. Google Earth Engine Implementation of SSEBop [37](#B37-remotesensing-15-00260)] for the generation of ETf at the EC tower sites and ETa (annual water year) used for the nationwide WBET analysis. We used the open-access SSEBop-FANO v0.2.6 Python implementation available at [https://github.com/Open-ET/openet-ssebop](https://github.com/Open-ET/openet-ssebop)(accessed on 21 April 2022) and featuring model configuration setup for the FANO parameters as discussed in [Section 2.2.3](#sec2dot2dot3-remotesensing-15-00260). To achieve time-integrated annual ETa, we performed routine aggregation calculations, as followed in Senay et al. [ [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)], for linear interpolation of daily ETf from Landsat satellite overpass. Using daily ETr, we produced daily total ETa and summed for our time periods of interest: 1 October-30 September water years for 2009, 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2018. 2.4.2. USGS On-Demand Overpass SSEBop ETa [https://espa.cr.usgs.gov/](https://espa.cr.usgs.gov/), accessed on 4 August 2022) in August 2022. This interface provides the public with the ability to order SSEBop ETa identical to that described in this paper for any Landsat Collection 2 (C2) image from Landsat 4-9 satellites for any location on the globe dating back to 1982. ESPA also offers an Application Programming Interface (API) for programmatic ordering and downloading of Landsat C2 ETa ( [https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/eros-science-processing-architecture-demand-interface-user-guide](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/eros-science-processing-architecture-demand-interface-user-guide), accessed on 4 [https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-4-9-collection-2-level-3-provisional-actual-evapotranspiration-algorithm](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-4-9-collection-2-level-3-provisional-actual-evapotranspiration-algorithm), accessed on 4 August 2022). 2 archive also includes Level-2 Surface Reflectance (L2SR) scenes that cannot be processed to ETa due to lack of surface temperature information; these scenes can occur over certain areas such as the Aleutian Islands, the Antarctic, or other small islands where the inputs needed for surface temperature are unavailable. The characteristics of the on-demand Landsat C2 L3 ETa is documented in the product guide ( [https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-4-9-collection-2-level-3-provisional-actual-evapotranspiration-product-guide](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-4-9-collection-2-level-3-provisional-actual-evapotranspiration-product-guide), accessed on 4 August 2022) as well as the Landsat Mission Website ( [https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-provisional-actual-evapotranspiration-science-product](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-provisional-actual-evapotranspiration-science-product), accessed on 4 August 2022). The processing runtime for any individual Landsat scene is typically around two minutes and many scenes can be run in parallel using Python and Linux environments. [Section 3](#sec3-remotesensing-15-00260)including a summary of ETa by landcover type. Landcover types used to evaluate ESPA products were downloaded from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Cover Type L3 500 m Grid (MCD12Q1v006). 3. Results 3.1. Water Balance Evaluation [Figure 6](#remotesensing-15-00260-f006)demonstrates the map of annual ETa calculated from a 5-year median using the SSEBop FANO model. The median was chosen for [Figure 6](#remotesensing-15-00260-f006)(small number of years) while the average was used for the statistical comparison against WBET. The CONUS-wide HUC8 annual ETa comparison for each water year and the 5-year (2009, 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2018) average is shown in [Figure 7](#remotesensing-15-00260-f007). The overall results indicate the improved performance of SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) over the SSEBop v0.1.7. mm/yr (11%) (17%) to 104 mm/yr (14%). The r values are above 0.93 for both versions of SSEBop at the CONUS scale. Overall, the SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) tends to lower the ETa positive bias from SSEBop v0.1.7, resulting in a slight negative bias negative bias for both dry (2011) and wet (2016) water years, whereas SSEBop v0.1.7 showed positive and negative biases for the wet and dry water years, respectively. The MAE and RMSE are lower for SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) compared to SSEBop v0.1.7 for all water years except water year 2018. The r values are comparable on both versions of SSEBop at 0.89 for all water-years. [Figure 8](#remotesensing-15-00260-f008). Overall results performance of SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) over SSEBop v0.1.7. Bias is reduced from regions, resulting in within \u00b15% ( [Table 3](#remotesensing-15-00260-t003)). MAE and RSME are also lower from SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) at all regions except the Midwest region. The SSEBop v0.1.7 shows positive bias at the Northeast and Southeast regions (>10%), but these magnitudes are lowered by SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) (<5%). Similarly, the high negative bias by SSEBop v0.1.7 at the West and Pacific Northwest regions (6%) are lowered by SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) (5%). The overall pattern of positive bias at the eastern regions (Northeast and Southeast) and negative bias at the western regions (West and Pacific Northwest) remain similar from both versions of SSEBop. However, the positive bias from SSEBop v0.1.7 at the Midwest and Great Plains regions show with a smaller negative bias with SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO). 3.2. EC Tower Evaluation [Table 4](#remotesensing-15-00260-t004)). Therefore, while a climatology Gridmet may not require an adjustment, the annual ETr appears to require an adjustment of about 15%, which is comparable to the findings of Blankenau et al. [ [39](#B39-remotesensing-15-00260)] who reported a bias range of 12% to 31% across CONUS. Bawa et al. [ [40](#B40-remotesensing-15-00260)] also used a correction coefficient of 0.85 to account for the higher bias in Gridmet during the generation of ETa over the Missouri River Basin. [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)]. When using climatology ETr, SSEBop ETa improved the overall bias from the EC Towers from 39.2% in v0.1.7 down to only 3.0% above the tower in v0.2.6 (FANO) along with a reduction in RMSE from 1.76 mm down to 1.36 mm ( [Table 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-t005)). It is important to note that part of the SSEBop ETa RMSE could be attributed to the Gridmet-related RMSE, which showed an RMSE of 1.86 mm when compared to station ETr ( [Table 4](#remotesensing-15-00260-t004)). This indicates the importance of accounting for the effect of ETr when trying to improve model performance. [Table 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-t005)). Similarly, when using the annual Gridmet ETr scaled by a factor of 0.85 (equivalent to a 15% reduction in magnitude), SSEBop ETa improved in performance from v0.1.7 [ [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260)] to v0.2.6 (FANO). The reduction in overall bias was almost identical, dropping from >37.0% with v0.1.7 to <4% above the EC towers with v0.2.6 regardless of the type of ETr ( [Table 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-t005)). Similarly, the RMSE reduces from 1.88 in v0.1.7 down to 1.47 mm in v0.2.6 (FANO) using the annual ETr. The correlation between the EC Tower ETa and SSEBop ETa also improves from r = 0.69 and r = 0.65 for v0.1.7 using the climatology and annual ETr, respectively, to r = 0.76 and r = 0.74 with v0.2.6 (FANO), which corresponds to approximately a 10% increase in correlation using the new FANO implementation ( [Table 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-t005)). [Table 6](#remotesensing-15-00260-t006)shows the summary accuracy statistics of these two landcover types. For the cropland sites (n = 8), the improvement in SSEBop accuracy from v0.1.7 to v0.2.6 (FANO) was measurable although less than the overall averages (23 sites) shown above in [Table 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-t005). For cropland sites, SSEBop improved from v0.1.7 to v0.2.6 (FANO) in correlation where the r improved from 0.77 to 0.86; the RMSE improved from 1.48 mm to 1.21 mm, and in bias, where the percent bias dropped from 11% to 7%, although the bias for both v0.1.7 and v0.2.6 (FANO) stayed within 15% of the tower. The grassland sites (n = 6) also showed a clear improvement in accuracy of SSEBop ETa between v0.1.7 and v0.2.6 (FANO) where the percent bias dropped from 47% in v0.1.7 down to only 2% in v0.2.6. The correlation improved from r = 0.61 in v0.1.7 up to r = 0.73 in v0.2.6 (FANO) and the RMSE error reduced from 1.88 mm to 1.35 mm. Although both cropland and grassland had improvements in correlation, error, and magnitude from v0.1.7 SSEBop ETa to v0.2.6 (FANO), the improvements on grassland are more substantial, which strengthens the FANO implementation on a wider scale. It is important to note that these are daily scale comparisons and the RMSE and correlation are expected to improve with larger aggregation periods such as monthly and seasonal times scales. [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)displays the seasonality of monthly averages of SSEBop ETa (two model versions) and EC Tower ETa for both cropland and grassland sites. The blue line in [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)a (flux) shows the average ETa from the eight cropland sites for each month from the EC towers. The red line (SSEBop v0.1.7) shows the SSEBop ETa from v0.1.7, which generally matches the EC towers during the summer months, with some underestimation, but greatly exceeds the EC Towers during the winter and early spring months and again after the harvest in the fall months ( [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)a). The green line (SSEBop FANO v0.2.6), on the other hand, does not show the same overestimation in the winter or shoulder months (actually shows underestimation) and also shows much higher correlation with the seasonal pattern of ETa from the EC towers ( [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)a). The improvement in seasonal pattern of ETa for SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) as opposed to SSEBop v0.1.7 is well illustrated. However, the spring season underestimation by v0.2.6 over cropland sites requires further investigation. [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)b). SSEBop v0.1.7 shows higher biases on a monthly level compared to the EC tower ETa for most of the year with biases lessened in the peak summer months. SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO), on the other hand, shows higher agreement with the flux tower ETa, only slightly underestimating the towers in the spring months and overestimating in the peak summer and fall months. The accuracy metrics shown in [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)at monthly time scale are much improved compared to that presented in [Table 6](#remotesensing-15-00260-t006)(daily) due to the spatiotemporal averaging effect on random errors except the bias, which remains more comparable to daily statistics as expected. The bias differences between the monthly ( [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)) and the daily ( [Table 6](#remotesensing-15-00260-t006)) can be attributed to different sample size across the months, with fewer stations in the winter compared to summer season. For example, using SSEBop FANO accuracy improvements from daily to monthly for cropland show with r (0.86 versus 0.95) and RMSE (1.21 versus 0.60 mm/day) grassland versus 0.95) and RMSE (1.35 versus mm/day). The [Table 6](#remotesensing-15-00260-t006)) and monthly ( [Figure 9](#remotesensing-15-00260-f009)) are comparable to metrics for remote sensing ET models reported by OpenET [ [41](#B41-remotesensing-15-00260)]. 3.3. On-Demand SSEBop Evapotranspiration [https://github.com/Open-ET/openet-ssebop](https://github.com/Open-ET/openet-ssebop)(accessed on 21 April 2022). The global SSEBop ETa product from the same version is available on-demand for each Landsat scene from the USGS EROS on 10](#remotesensing-15-00260-f010)displays a sample of four Landsat SSEBop ETa downloaded from ESPA for locations in ( [Figure 10](#remotesensing-15-00260-f010)a) the Central Valley of California, ( [Figure 10](#remotesensing-15-00260-f010)b) near the Nile River Delta in Egypt, ( [Figure 10](#remotesensing-15-00260-f010)c) in the state of Bahia, Brazil, and ( [Figure 10](#remotesensing-15-00260-f010)d) near Nanjing, China, in the Yangtze River Delta. This represents the ETa expressed over the landscape for an individual day when there is a Landsat observation, with arbitrary dates chosen for each scene. Landcover-based spatially averaged SSEBop ETa shows the relative amounts of ETa by landcover type with croplands using around 3.8 mm for a mid-season date in California; 1.5 mm of ETa for a late-season date in Bahia, Brazil; 2.6 mm of ETa for a late-season date in Egypt; and 4.3 mm of ETa for a mid-season date in Nanjing, China ( [Figure 11](#remotesensing-15-00260-f011)). ESPA SSEBop ETa provides a prediction of SSEBop ETa (with the new FANO implementation) for every Landsat observation for any given area. Users can download overpass-level SSEBop ETa from ESPA and using simple linear interpolation tools can interpolate and aggregate to a monthly ETa with an algorithm of their choice. 4. Discussion 4.1. WBET Evaluation [Table 7](#remotesensing-15-00260-t007)). These biases are similar to the range of errors reported in the previous studies [ [16](#B16-remotesensing-15-00260), [33](#B33-remotesensing-15-00260), [34](#B34-remotesensing-15-00260)] and within the expected bias range of 10-20% from remote sensing-based energy balance algorithms [ [42](#B42-remotesensing-15-00260)]. [Figure 7](#remotesensing-15-00260-f007)b). Such negative biases are consistent for all water years except the wet water year 2016 ( [Figure 7](#remotesensing-15-00260-f007)d). These HUC8s are in the West region (California) and had runoff (Q) value of zero (0.0), resulting in higher WBET, which in turn creates a substantial negative bias by SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO). [Table 3](#remotesensing-15-00260-t003)). 5-year average comparison 1079 The increase in WBET-qualified HUC8s is mostly in the Great Plains region, with an increase of 415 HUC8s with SSEBop v0.2.6 (FANO) compared to 264 HUC8s with SSEBop v0.1.7. However, on a one-to-one comparison of the two versions of SSEBop for the CONUS-scale comparison, there are only 1000 identical HUC8s that are comparable between both versions of SSEBop and WBET ( [Table 3](#remotesensing-15-00260-t003)). [Table 7](#remotesensing-15-00260-t007)). For the regional scale, the percent bias, percent MAE, and percent RMSE are within \u00b14%, 16%, and 21%, respectively. In the Great Plains region, where the number comparable HUC8s increased ( [Figure 1](#remotesensing-15-00260-f001)), SSEBop v0.2.6 decreased percent RMSE from 6% to 2%, 16% to values are 0.90 for CONUS scale and 0.73 for regional scale comparisons, except the Northeast and Southeast regions ( [Table 7](#remotesensing-15-00260-t007)). The ETa values for the Northeast and Southeast regions are clustered and lack a dynamic range ( [Figure 8](#remotesensing-15-00260-f008)a,b) compared to other regions ( [Figure 8](#remotesensing-15-00260-f008)c-f), resulting in relatively lower r values. However, the model captures the average values accurately as demonstrated by the bias, MAE, and RMSE. 4.2. FANO Constant [43](#B43-remotesensing-15-00260), [44](#B44-remotesensing-15-00260), [45](#B45-remotesensing-15-00260)]. Allen et al. [ [46](#B46-remotesensing-15-00260)] summarized the degree of the linear relation with a 1.25 proportionality constant when Kc is expressed as the fraction of the alfalfa-based reference ET, i.e., Kc = 1.25 * NDVI. It important to note the independent formulation of Kc and ETf in that Kc is estimated as the ratio of actual ET to reference ET whereas ETf is estimated using Equation (2) from land surface temperature using the principle of satellite psychrometry. [47](#B47-remotesensing-15-00260)] also established a similar coefficient of 1.25 in relating the fraction of incoming photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and NDVI in their parametric equation for the estimation of terrestrial net primary production. Palmer and Yunusa [ [48](#B48-remotesensing-15-00260)] used a linear formulation to estimate actual evapotranspiration and biomass from fPAR, which can be derived from NDVI using a linear assumption [ [49](#B49-remotesensing-15-00260)]. 4.3. Climatology vs. Annual Gridmet Reference ET [Table 4](#remotesensing-15-00260-t004)). However, the differences were dampened at the actual ETa level ( [Table 5](#remotesensing-15-00260-t005)), highlighting the importance of the land surface temperature in controlling the spatiotemporal variability of ETa. This reinforces the reliability of climatology ETr, especially for operational applications as used by the global ESPA-based SSEBop ETa. Additionally, it validates the use of a bias correction factor for the annual Gridmet ETr. 4.4. Challenges and Limitations [47](#B47-remotesensing-15-00260)] where they expected the greatest errors in using a constant linear NDVI relationship to occur over areas with low NDVI (i.e., areas with small vegetation cover). According to Huete [ [50](#B50-remotesensing-15-00260)], errors caused by soil effects amount to about 10%. In addition to NDVI from sparse vegetation, water bodies are also modeled with maximum ET rates ( [Table 2](#remotesensing-15-00260-t002)) without taking into account seasonal heat storage changes [ [51](#B51-remotesensing-15-00260)]. Thus, modeled ETa from deep waterbodies may not be reliable at a monthly rate but could provide a reasonable estimate at annual time scales due to a seasonal shift in heat storage and release. 5.
