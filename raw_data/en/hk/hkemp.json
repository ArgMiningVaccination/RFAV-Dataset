In addition, ethical, legal, social and organisational issues related to folate testing are investigated. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted on 3 databases ( PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library ) up to 1 Aug ust 2022. In addition, grey literature sources were searched for clinical practice guidelines and ongoing clinical trials. Direct from- test-to-health- outcomes evidence was preferentially sought . This evidence refers to studies that compare groups of people receiving either the current diagnostic test or the proposed diagnostic test , and measures the different ial impact of the tests on patient health outcomes. In the absence of this evidenc e a linked evidence approach was undertaken, including an evalu ation of diagnostic accuracy, change in clinical management, and the impact of management decisions on clinical outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using appraisal tools appropriate to the included study designs: systematic reviews and meta- analyses were evaluated using the ASMTAR -2 tool, diagnostic accuracy studies were evaluated using the QUADAS -2 tool, single -arm studies were evaluated using the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) quality appraisal tool for case series . Due to the limited evidence available, meta- analysis was not possible. Therefore, the results are summarised narratively. Clinical evaluation No direct from- test-to-health- outcomes evidence was identified, thus a linked evidence approach was used to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of folate testing. Diagnostic accuracy A single study published in 1984, which measured red blood cell (RBC) folate in 110 patients compared to haematological and clinical findi ngs as the reference standard reported the sensitivity of folate testing to be 96% and the specificity to be 71 % depending on the group of patients measured. The diagnostic accuracy findings are based on very low certainty evidence, the single study informing these results was considered at high risk of bias , and there is a high risk the findings HTA Report : Folate Testing ii are not applicable to Swiss practice given the test used is not reflective of current ly methods ; thus the results should be interpreted with great caution. Change in management No studies reported change in management (i.e. comparing treatment decisions made with and without folate test results) ; however, 8 single -arm studies reported clinician management decisions following a low folate test result. These studies had inherently high risk of bias due to their study design (either case series or case control) . It was consistently reported that, among patients suspected of folate deficiency and warranting a tes t, rates of folate deficiency were low (0.4 %- 4.9%). Clinician response to folate test results was universally low across all studies; among patients with a low folate diagnosis, only 24- 62% received supplementation. There are concerns about the applicability of this data to the Swiss context , as most w ere collected from countries with mandatory folic acid fortification; however, a single study from Denmark (without mandatory fortification) reported results that were consistent with the rest of the evidence. Overall, the certainty of the management outcome data was considered very low due to risk of bias and applicability concerns. Impact of change in management Due to the limited evidence for accuracy, and the absence of evidence for change in management , the impact of change in management could not be assessed. Safety of folic acid supplementation without testing An umbrella review of meta- analyses indicates that folic acid supplementation is generally considered safe. Supplementation was associated with a decreased risk of a range of chronic condition and adverse health outcomes ; however , higher rates of prostate cancer (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04, 1.49) and colorectal adenoma (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06, 1.70) were reported. With the exception of colorectal adenoma, these results were informed by high- or moderate- quality meta- analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs ) as assessed by GRADE . Data from observational studies also showed an association between maternal folic acid supplementation and subsequent child asthma and/or wheeze for some measurements of these outcomes; however, data was mixed and this association is considered uncertain. Budget impact assessment Based on the limited evidence for the effectiveness of folate testing, cost -effectiveness analysis was not conducted. A budget impact assessment was conducted, which projects the current trends in the utilisation of folate testing and folic acid supplementation from 2022- 2026. Assuming no change to the current reimbursement polic ies, the total budget expenditure on folate testing is projected to HTA Report : Folate Testing iii increase from CHF 14.3 million in 2022 to CHF 21.5 million in 2026 ; folic acid supplementation is projected to increase from CHF 7.9 million in 2022 to CHF 9.3 million in 2026 . Due to the limit ed evidence for the effectiveness of folate testing, scenarios investigating the impact of possible policy changes were not modelled. Ethical, legal, social and o rganisational (ELSO) issues A total of 8 studies were identified that addressed various ethical, social and organisational aspects of folate testing. No studies reporting legal issues were identified. Most studies identified addressed organisational issues relating to test restriction. Unsurpris ingly, the 4 studies that described interventions to restrict folate testing noted significant cost savings. Ethical issues identified included potential adverse events from taking a supplement , a potential scenario owing to false positive test results or incorrect diagnosis in the absence of a test . Studies on social issues were in relation to physicians' opinions and concerns regarding an initiative to reduce folate test orders, which were mostly supportive, and citizens ' opinions on test disinvestment. Guidelines and existing HTAs Five clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were identified that focused on 2 specific populations ; patients undergoing bariatric surgery and patients with suspected neurological deficiency as indicated by worsening gait ataxia. None of the CPGs were on folate testing, specifically . Evidence informing recommendations was either not reported or was of low quality (i.e. expert opinion) . Only one CPG reported a threshold for identifying a folate deficient patient , and none made recommendations regarding timing or frequency of testing or follow -up testing in the case of deficiency . The searches identified 4 health technology assessments (HTAs) on folate testing (3 Canadian, 1 Australian) . The findings were generally congruent with this current HTA , that there is a lack of evidence available to determine the effectiveness of folate testing. Conclusions Due to an absence of evidence the safety and effectiveness of folate testing is uncertain. There is no direct evidence examining the impact of folate testing on patient outcomes ; similarly, evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of folate tests is limited to a single study published in 1984 with a high risk of bias and questionable applicability to current practice. There are no studies examining change in management based on the results of folate testing compared to no folate testing. These results broadly reflect the same results of prior HTA reports published on the topic .

Objective of the HTA report The objective of a health technology assessment ( HTA) is to generate a focused assessment of various aspects of a health technology. The analytic methods applied to assess the value of using a health technology , their execution and the results are described. The analytical process is comparative, systematic and transparent , and involves multiple stakeholders. The domains covered in a n HTA report include clinical effectiveness and safety, costs, cost -effectiveness and budget impact, and ethical, legal, social and organisational issues. The purpose is to inform health policy and decision- making to promote an efficient, sustainable, equitable and high- quality health system. HTA Report : Folate Testing 1 1 Policy q uestion and c ontext Each HTA topic entails a policy and a research question. In healthcare, a policy question is a request to regulate a reimbursement policy and is aimed at securing financing of health technologies. Such a request, related to a particular health technology, typically addresses an existing controversy around a technology. In Switzerland, there are currently no limitations on mandatory insurance coverage of folate tests. 1 A sharp increase in the number of folate tests has been observed, with the number of folate serum tests ordered increasing from 510,589 to 738,164 and the number of folate red blood cell (RBC) tests increasing from 57,827 to 96,445 between 2016 and 2020, with no corresponding change in medical necessity (Table 1).2 Limitation of coverage (e.g. to specific indications) could be considered if the effectiveness, appropriateness and economic efficiency (EAE) criteria of folate testing are not fulfilled or in light of the increasing utilisation patterns.1 Therefore, this HTA has been proposed to evaluate the EAE criteria of carrying out folate tests. Table 1 Number of clai ms and costs of folate tests in Switzerland, 2016 to 2020 Year 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Folate test, serum cell . Source Tarifpool : SASIS AG2 HTA Report : Folate Testing 2 2 Medical b ackground 2.1 Function of folate Folate is the natural form of vitamin B9, an essential, water -soluble vitamin required for the synthesis of nucleic acids.3 Most folate is present in its inactive form (5- methyltetrahydrofolate (5- methyl THF) in blood serum. After entering the cells, 5-methyl THF demethylates to tetrahydrofol ate (THF), which is the active form of folate involved in folate- dependent enzymatic reactions . These reactions are important for synthesising nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids and also for the maturation of RBCs . Vitamin B12 is a cofactor required for the demethylation of 5-methyl THFA . In the absence of Vitamin B12, folate remains in its inactive form.4 As a result , cell d ivision is impaired and toxic metabolites accumulate. Thus , a deficiency of either folate or vitamin B12 will impair the production of THFA. The impairment of DNA synthesis prevents cell division in the bone marrow , leading to the production of large RBC s (megal oblastic anaemia) .5 Vitamin B12 deficiency also results in elevated methylmalonic acid levels and neurological signs that are not seen with folate deficiency. For this reason, vitamin B12 status is often checked before administering folic acid supplementation due to a suspec ted folate deficiency anaemia.3 Homocysteine, an amino acid which serves as an intermediate in methionine metabolism, requires both folate and vitamin B12 for its metabolis m. 6 As such, d eficiencies in either folate or B12 may also result in increased levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) . 2.2 Sources of folate Folate is found naturally in a wide variety of foods including leafy green vegetables and animal products including eggs, seafood and cheese; however, approximately 50% of the folate naturally present in food is bioavailable.7 Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate used in supplements and the fortification of foods.3 Given the need for adequate folate levels pri or to conception to prevent neural tube defects, many health organisations recommend women of reproductive age take folic acid supplements. Some countries, including the United States of America (USA), Canada and Australia, have mandatory folic acid fortification of staple foods. Across European countries, voluntary and mandatory fortification policies vary. 8 In Switzerland, approximately 200 food products are enriched with folic acid by the food industry on a voluntary basis but there is no mandatory fortification of foods.9 HTA Report : Folate Testing 3 2.3 Causes of f olate deficiency Adults need approximately 400 mcg of folate per day to replenish daily losses , with deficiency tak ing approximately 8 to 16 weeks to become evident.10 Poor diet , owing to poverty , is a known cause of nutritional deficiency .11 Folate deficiency due to decreased intake is also observed in old age,12 in people who have undergone bariatric surgery ,13 alcoholism,14 and in people on fad diets .15 Other causes of folate deficiency can be classified into 3 categories: increased requirements , impaired absorption and genetic folate disorders . Increased requirements Increased requirements for folate, leading to deficiency, can occur due to pregnancy and lactation, and diseases such as ha emolytic anaemia, leukaemia, and aggressive lymphomas (owing to ). Exfoliative dermatitis and haemodialysis cause folate deficiency through increase d loss.5 11 Impaired absorption Folate deficiency as a function of impaired absorption is associated with: Alcoholism interferes with folate absorption and uptake, accelerates folate breakdown and increases its excretion by the kidneys.14 People who are heavily alcohol dependent may also have a poor diet , resulting in inadequate nutrient intake. Medical conditions that affect nutrient absorption include tropical sprue, coeliac disease, short bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.10 Prescription medications such as methotrexate, a drug used to treat a range of disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer , are folate antagonist s. Anticonvulsants , such as phenytoin, used in the treatment of epilepsy , decrease serum as well as liver folate levels .16 17 Genetic folate disorders Congenit al folate disorders lead to folate deficiency through either the defective absorption and transport of folate through cells , or the defective utilisation of folate to enzyme deficiencies.18 Hereditary folate malabsorption is a folate deficiency disorder with impaired intestinal folate absorption and impaired folate transport into the central nervous system. Signs include macrocytic ana emia, recurrent infections, and neurological the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase conversion of 5,10- methyleneTHF to 5-methyl TH F, which is the primary form of folate in the blood.20 Severe MTHFR deficiency , is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with developmental delay, mental retardation, seizures and motor abnormalities.17 HTA Report : Folate Testing 4 2.4 Incidence /prevalence of folate deficiency No studies were identified that estimate the prevalence of folate deficiency in the general Swiss population; however, a recent cohort study investigating RBC folate levels in Swiss women (171 women of reproductive age and 177 who w ere pregnant) reported that 19.9% of women of reproductive age and 2.8% of pregnant women were folate deficient ( RBC folate concentration <340 nmol/L [<150 ng/ml ]). Of the women who were pregnant, 83% were on supplements containing folate, compared with 11% of women of reproductive age.9 Another study investigated folate levels across three age groups (60 -69, 70- 79 and 80 years ) in 1,143 healthy Swiss senior citizens. The study found that whilst total serum folate significantly decreased with increasing age, RBC folate did not ; however, for both serum and RBC folate a significant difference between males and females was reported, with lower levels in males . The reference interval , combining all gender and age strata for serum folate the reference interval , combining all gender and age strata was 444 (90% CI: 408- the adequacy of folate status in Europe appears to vary widely across countries , with some populations , such as Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands appearing to have suboptimal intake.8 This is based on national survey data reporting on the nutritional behaviour of populations in European countries.22 2.5 Diagnosis of folate deficiency The diagnosis of folate deficiency is complex , with no single test serving as a diagnostic reference standard.5 In the absence of a reference standard , several factors are used to establish a diagnosis. Physicians must first consider patient history , including dietary and drug history and alcohol use , in addition to physical presentation.10 Physical symptoms that may raise suspicion of deficiency include anorexia, cognitive impairment, depression and dementia.10 Patients with folate- deficient anaemia have symptoms similar to other anaemias , such as fatigue and pallor. In addition, in cases of severe folate deficiency they may have g lossitis, gastrointestinal discomfort and d iarrhoea.15 It should be noted that biochemical and clinical evidence of deficiency can be observed in the absence of any physical symptoms .23 Direct methods of determining if a patient is folate deficient include measurement of folate concentration in the blood, by either serum folate or RBC folate tests. Depending on the patient 's physical presentation , history and serum folate or RBC folate test results , a range of other laboratory tests may be conducted. HTA Report : Folate Testing 5 For example, plasma homocysteine, which accumulate s because of folate deficiency11, may be tested if serum/plasma folate levels indicate a deficiency or are indeterminate but the patient has no clinical symptoms .24 If the cause of anaemia is being investigated other tests might include measuring mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and peripheral blood smears . Patients with elevated MC V may have a megalo blastic disorder ; the presence of megaloblastic changes usually implies either a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency . The presence of oval macrocytes in a peripheral blood smear is also suggestive of a megalo blastic disorder.5 metabolic roles of folate and vi tamin B12 are closely linked, and both can cause megaloblastic macrocytic anaemia, patients evaluated for folate deficiency as the cause of megaloblastic macrocytic anaemia, are also often evaluated for vitamin B12 deficiency.10 With respect to serum and RBC folate tests , the only guideline identified on the diagnosis and treatment of folate disorders published by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology, state s that there is no clear consensus as to what cut -off value is used to define deficiency with r espect to serum values . However, the committee notes that clinicians conventionally have used a serum folate level of <7 nmol/ L indicative of folate deficiency (Grade 1B level of evidence = strong recommendation (confidence that the benefits outweigh the harm), moderate level of evidence).23 A scientific opinion publication by t he European Food and Safety Authority states that serum folate concentrations <6.8 nmol/ L ) are cut-off values indicative of folate deficiency , noting that the cut -offs for deficiency were determined in adults.25 However, they further note that for the assessment of folate status, multiple measurements of serum folate should be taken over a period of several weeks or a single measurement should be combined with other bi omarkers of folate status.25 This is because serum folate levels vary with recent food intak e and acute dietary changes can result in low levels without any significant tissue deficiency.26 Thus, a single measurement of serum folate is not informative of folate status as it reflects folate levels at the time of blood collection, i.e. in response to recent food intake or acute dietary changes .25 The W orld Health Organi zation (WHO) has published recommended folate thresholds for monitoring trends in folate status in populations and the impact of public health interventions. The values (applicable to all age groups) are based on the concentration below which homocysteine levels start to rise. The cut-off for is <340 nmol/ L (<150 ng/ml). The WHO notes that measurements obtained by radioimmunoassy need adjustment to make them comparable with the microbiological assay.27 It should be noted that these cut -off values are for the purpose of monitoring folate status in populations and the impact of interventions such as folic acid fortification, not for the clinical assessment of folate deficiency. HTA Report : Folate Testing 6 The serum and RBC folate levels that analytical laboratories in Switzerland use as a cut -off value to diagnose folate defici ency are not published. Cut -off values for deficiency have been found to be dependent on the analytical platform used .28 2.6 Treatment of folate deficiency Folate deficiency is treated with folic acid supplementation. Intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular formulations can be used for patients unable to take oral medications.10 The amount necessary is dependent on the reason for the deficiency. Guidelines by the British Committee f or Standards in Haematology recommend those outlined by the British National Formulary (Grade 1A level of evidence = strong recommendation [confidence that the benefits outweigh the harm] , high quality of evidence). These are summarised in the guidelines as follows: Folate deficient megaloblastic anaemia (due to dietary insufficiency, pregnancy or antiepileptics) : 5 mg of folic acid daily for 4 months, except in pregnancy where it is continued until term, and up to 15 mg daily for 4 months in malabsorptive states . Chronic haemolytic states and renal dialysis : the prophylactic dose suggested is 5 mg daily to weekly, depending on the diet and rate of haemolysis . Pregnancy : the prophylactic dose suggested is 200 to 500 \u00b5g daily. 23 The duration of therapy depends on whether cause of the initial deficiency continues . Patients with malabsorption disorders may require long- term treatment.10 3 Technology 3.1 Technology description There are 2 types of laboratory tests funded in Switzerland by mandatory health insurance for the determination of a patient's folate status: Serum folate is not strictly a diagnostic test for body folate depleti on, as serum folate level s reflect recent dietary intake (short term status). Also, recent alcohol abuse may result in a low serum folate concentration without body depletion because alcohol interferes with the absorption of folate and speeds the rate that folate breaks down and is excreted from the body .29 In comparison, RBC folate is an indicator of long term folate status , reflecting folate status during the past four months ...26 However, subnormal RBC folate levels may occur in patients with severe vitamin B12 deficiency and return to normal following vitamin B12 supplementation alone.26 This is owing to an interrelationship between these two vitamins . Vitamin B12 is a cofactor required for the demethylation of 5- methyl THF (the inactive form of folate) to tetrahydrofolate (the biologically active form involved in folate dependent enzymatic reactions). Thus, a HTA Report : Folate Testing 7 deficiency in vitamin B12 l eads to and increased proportion of folate trapped inside cells as 5- methyl THF.10 The determination of folate in serum/plasma is reported to be the most common laboratory test used for folate status evaluation; however, there is disagreement among experts regarding the optimal folate assay to use.28 Measurement of RBC folate is said to be more technically demanding , and thus more expensive, than serum folate measurement because of the greater pre-treatment it requires , which includes lysis of the RBCs and deconjugation of the polyglutamate present , and dilution of the intracellular folate down to a range that can be measured by the ass ay.30 31 The pre-treatment involved in the analysis of RBC folate is reported to introduce several variables into the measurement process.30 After measurement of the amount of folate present in the whole blood lysate, the RBC folate concentration is calculated using the patient's haematocri t. Me asurement of haematocrit is said to introduce further uncertainty , and is another process unique to RBC folate determination.30 31 The British Committee for Standards in Haematology guideline on folate diagnosis states that RBC folate is not necessary because serum folate alone is sufficient in most cases (Grade 1A level of evidence = strong recommendation (confidence that the benefits outweigh the harm) , high quality of evidence). However, in the presence of strong clinical suspicion of folate deficiency , despite a normal serum level, an RBC folate assay may be undertaken, having ruled out vitamin B12 deficiency (Grade 2B level of evidence = weak recommendation (magnitude of benefit is less certain) , moderate quality of evidence).23 Several methods can be used in the assessment of folate in both serum and RBCs mass spectrometry (HPLC -MS/MS).32 Microbiological assays were the original method used to measure both serum and RBC folate and are historically considered to be the reference standard measurement technique.33 Automated immunoassays based on the competitive or non- competitive binding of labell ed folate and endogenous folates to a folate- binding protein are now reported to be the most routinely used methods to determine serum and RBC folate in patients , owing to their lower cost and high throughput.24 34 35 It is reported that competitive protein binding assaying is an expensive diagnostic tool and the laboratory costs are substantially equal for serum and RBC methods.28 Limitations of the automated folate binding assays have been reported , relating to the variable affinity the various forms of folate in the serum or RBCs have for the folate binding protein dependent on the assay conditions .24 There are numerous automated platforms available for RBC and serum folate determination. A recent ly published comparison of 4 different immunoassays for serum folate determination found that the consistency of the results among these assays was not good and most method differences among the assays exceeded the acceptable quality specific ation.35 Very significant differences in results have also been reported betwee n commercial immunoassays for RBC folate .34 HTA Report : Folate Testing 8 The methods used to analyse serum and RBC folate in Switzerland are not specified in the Analysenliste.36 3.2 Alternative technologies Serum and RBC folate test s are the only tests reimbursed by mandatory health insurance in Switzerland for the specific evaluati on of folate deficiency . It is noted that serum, blood or plasma homocysteine testing is listed on the Analysenliste (position number 1422.00, Tax point 27.0). Plasma h omocysteine has been evaluated as a biomarker of folate status and has been observed to negatively correlate with serum folate and RBC folate in a number of studies .30 However, it should be noted that it is not a specific indicator of folate status because deficiencies in other vitamins ( vitamin B12, B6 and riboflavin) can also cause it to be elevated.37 Folate g uidelines published by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology recommend that plasma homocysteine should only be measured to confirm suspected folate deficiency in special circumstances .23 It is not known whether homocysteine tests are being ordered by doctors in Switzerland for the evaluation of patients with suspected folate deficiency. The alternative to testing for folate is the initiation of folic acid supplementation based on the patient's risk factors and clinical symptoms. 3.3 Reimbursement status In Switzerland, serum and RBC folate testing is reimbursed under mandatory health insurance through the Analysenliste (German), Liste des Analyses (French) or Elenco delle Analisi (Italian) (Table 2) . There are no restrictions on either test.

The proposed questions addressing each component of the EAE criteria are described separately.1 4.1 Effectiveness outcomes: D irect from -test-to-health -outcomes evidence For the evaluation of clinical outcomes, direct from -test-to-health- outcomes evidence w as sought preferentially as it directly addresses the policy question (represented by arrow C in Figure 1 ). Direct from- test-to-health- outcomes evidence refers to evidence from studies that measure the impact of conducting a test on a health outcome.38 This includes studies in which the treatment decisions are directly linked to a test result ; health outcomes are differentiated based on test results and subsequent treatment decisions.38 No direct from- test-to-health- outcomes evidence was identified, necess itating the use of a linked evidence approach (represented by arrows D to F in Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Evaluation framework for diagnostic tests Source Medical Services Advisory Committee38 4.2 Effectiveness outcomes: L inked evidence approach A linked evidence approach was undertaken to evaluate the impact of folate testing on patient outcomes. In a linked evidence approach, the evidence generated by direct from- test-to-health- outcomes evidence is broken down into stages, each representing a different component of the pathway from test to health outcome. HTA Report : Folate Testing 10 The first step in the linked evidence approach is to investigate the clinical performance of the test ( Table 3). Early phase studies establishing the analytical validity of the tests (test -retest reliabil ity etc.) were not included. Subsequently, the impact of the test outcomes on patient management wa s evaluated ( Table 4). The final step in the linked evidence approach was to investigate the impact of any potential changes in management on patient outcomes ( Table 5). Table 3 Research question and study selection criteria for linked evidence: diagnostic accuracy of folate testing Research question In the asymptomatic general population or in those with suspected folate deficiency due to the presence of symptoms, underlying medical disorders, or external factors, what is the diagnostic accuracy of folate testing?

Additionally, the list of symptoms associated with folate deficiency reported here is not exhaustive. All outcomes reported in the included literature will be considered, with prioritisation by a clinical expert if needed. 4.4 Economic outcomes Economic outcomes relate to the cost and cost -effectiveness or cost -utility of the medical s ervice, ultimately reflecting the value for money offered by the service. These outcomes were planned to be evaluated by considering existing published literature where available, and through a de novo economic evaluation when existing literature was not available (Table 7) . Due to the absence of clinical evidence on the e ffectiveness of folate testing on health outcomes , a de novo economic evaluat ion was not possible. A budgetary impact assessment was conducted.

Issues related to ethical, legal, social or organisational matters relating to the use of folate testing were investigated in this domain, noting that only issues directly relevant to the policy question were described (Table 8) . Table 8 Research question and study selection criteria for appropriateness outcomes Research question Are there ethical, legal, social or organisational issues associated with folate testing and subsequent supplementation? Population Patients eligible for folate testing Intervention Supplementation following fol ate testing Comparator Supplementation with no testing Outcomes* Ethical : balance of benefits and harms (e.g. are there hidden or unintended consequences of conducting the test), autonomy (e.g. is the value of testing augmented by its impact on the autonomy of patients), equity (e.g. does the implementation of testing have impacts on equitable access to care acro ss the population). Legal : can the limitation of this technology to certain populations pose ethical challenges which have not been considered in existing legislations and regulations. Social : patient preferences and expectations about folate testing, care giver preferences and expectations about folate testing. Organisational : structure of the health system (e.g. are there standard cut -offs used to define folate deficiency), process -related costs (e.g. how would services be reoriented in the absence of folate testing and what costs would these incur), culture (e.g. how is folate testing accepted in practice). Study design(s) Systematic reviews, narrative reviews, randomised controlled trials, observational studies, cross - sectional studies (i.e. surveys), government reports. Language(s) English, French, German and Italian Notes * These outcomes have been defined in accordance with the EUnetHTA Core Model 3.0.40 HTA Report : Folate Testing 14 5 Methodology: Safety and effectiveness outcomes 5.1 Litera ture search strategy 5.1.1 Databases and other sources A systematic search of the scientific peer -reviewed literature addressing the research questions was performed in 3 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) on 26 July and 1 August 2022. No date restrictions were applied. The search strategies used are presented in Table 20 to Table 23 (Appendix A). Searches were also conducted in ClinicalTr ials.gov and the EU Clinical Trials Registry to identify ongoing clinical trials related to the research questions (Table 24 , Appendix A ). Grey literature searches were conducted on HTA agency websites and international HTA d atabases Table 27, Appendix A ) using to identify existing HTA reports on the same topic. Reference lists of included studies were pearled to identify additional studies. 5.1.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Studies were selected for inclusion according to the research questions, PICO criteria, study designs and languages d efined in Section 4. For the clinical questions, inclusion of existing systematic reviews (of moderate to high quality, per the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 [AMSTAR 2] checklist) w ere prefer entially sought. In the absence of eligible systematic reviews, primary studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for inclusion, starting with the highest level of evidence relevant to each research question according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) hierarchy of evidence.39 Conference abstracts, letters to the editor and author responses, case reports and animal studies were excluded from the review. 5.1.3 Study selection Two reviewers split the screening of all the titles and abstracts retrieved using the search strategies reported in Table 20 to Table 23 (Appendix A ). Grey literature searches ( for clinical trials and of CPG, specialty society and HTA websites ) were carried out by a single reviewer. The full text s of articles deemed potentially relevant w ere reviewed independently by 2 reviewers. Any disagreement s on article inclusions were resolved by consensus; if consensus c ould not be reached, a third independent reviewer was consulted to determine inclusion. HTA Report : Folate Testing 15 5.2 Data extraction, appraisal and synthesis 5.2.1 Data extraction One reviewer extract ed data into a standardised template, which was checked against the original study record by a second reviewer. Disagreements w ere settled by discussion or by a third independent reviewer. Data of interest include d: study information: country, year, number of institutions, study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, withdrawals, length of follow -up demographic information: number of participants, age, sex, comorbidities, indication for testing, prior testing intervention and comparator: type and method of intervention/comparator (including index test, reference test, dose and administration route), concomitant interventions outcomes of interest: diagnostic accuracy data, baseline, final or change from baseline scores in any of the predefined outcomes outlined in Section 4 any noteworthy features, limitations or differences in the study. 5.2.2 Critical appraisal Two independent researchers conduct ed critical appraisal, with differences settled via consensus or by an independent reviewer where consensus c ould not be reached. Critical appraisal was conducted using different tools depending on the study design. Umbrella review s of metanalyses were appraised using a modified AMSTAR 2 checklist ;41 diagnostic accuracy studies were apprais ed using the QUADAS -2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies Version 2) tool ;42 single -arm trials were appraised using the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) quality appraisal checklist for case series.43 The quality of evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach.44 The 5 domains of the GRADE framework (imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, risk of bias and publication bias) were assessed according to the decision algorithm developed by Pollock (2016).44 45 The overall strength of the evidence has been presented in 'Summary of Findings' tables generated in GRADEpro.44 5.2.3 Data synthesis Data from each population have been presented separately , where possible. In addition, data for each type of folate test (i.e. serum folate test and RBC folate test) have been presented separately , where possible. Where available, results relating to the following subgroups have been discussed: Outcomes for subpopulations (e.g. patients planning to become pregnant, pregnant patients, elderly) HTA Report : Folate Testing 16 Outcomes from studies conducted in settings with folate deficiency levels sim ilar to those found in Switzerland Any other subgroup in the included studies, determined before the analysis of results, decided in conjunction with a clinical expert. The approach to data synthesis for each research question depended on the available evi dence. Given the type of evidence available , each linked evidence domain has been summarised narratively. 5.3 Changes from the research protocol The original research protocol include d safety outcomes as part of the linked evidence assessment of effectiveness. In the HTA report, a separate section was created for safety , as noted in Section 4. HTA Report : Folate Testing 17 6 Clinical effectiveness and safety 6.1 Summary statement efficacy, effectiveness and safety 6.1.1 Direct evidence No direct test -to-patient -outcome evidence on folate testing was identified. 6.1.2 Linked evidence Diagnostic accuracy : One diagnostic cohort study measuring RBC folate in 110 patients reported the sensitivity of folate testing to be 96% and the specificity to 71%. The reference standard was confirmation of folate deficiency based on a range of haematological and clinical tests and dietary analysis . Not all patients had all tests. Th e diagnostic accuracy f indings are based on very low certainty evidence. T he sing le study informing these results was considered at high risk of bias , there is a high risk the findings are not applicable, and these results should be interpreted with caution. Change in management : No studies reported change in management (i.e. comparing t reatment decisions made with and without folate test results) ; however, 8 single -arm studies reported clinician management decisions following a low folate test resul t. These studies had inherently high risk of bias due to their study design. It was consistently reported that, among patients suspected of folate deficiency and warrant ing a test, rates of folate deficiency were low (0.4-4.9%). Clinician response to folate test results was universally low across all studies \u2014among patients with a low folate diagnosis, 24- 62% received supplementation. There are concerns about the applicability of these data as most w ere collected from countries with mandatory folic acid fortification; however, a single study from Denmark (without mandatory fortification) reported results consistent with the rest of the evidence. Folate deficiency levels reported by this study were 1.7% ( of tests requested by hospital doctors) and 1.3% ( of tests requested by general practitioners) , whilst supplementation initiation when folate deficiency was detected was only 54%, Impact from change in management : Due to the limited evidence for accuracy, and the absence of evidence for change in management, the impact of change in management could not be assessed. Safety of folate testing and supplementation: An umbrella review of meta- analyses indicates that folic acid supplementation is generally considered safe. It was not reported whether any of the reviews included patients who were diagnosed as being deficient. Supplementation was associated with a decreased risk of a wide range of chronic diseases and adverse health outcomes but higher rates of prostate cancer (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04, 1.49) and colorectal adenoma (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06, 1.70). HTA Report : Folate Testing 18 Excluding colorectal ad enoma, results were informed by high- or moderate- quality meta- analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs ) as assessed by GRADE . Data from observational studies also showed an association between maternal folic acid supplementation and subsequent child asthma and/or wheeze for some measurements of these outcomes; however, data w ere mixed and this association is uncertain. 6.2 Search results The results of the study selection process are presented in Figure 2. The search results from each database are reported in Table 20 to Table 23 (Appendix A ). After removal of duplicates , 6,653 records were screened by title/abstract. A total of 568 were reviewed by full text, of which 9 met the inclusion criteri a. No eligible systematic reviews were identified; therefore, primary studies formed the basis of the clinical effectiveness and safety section. The list of studies excluded at full -text review , with reasons for exclusion, is available upon request. HTA Report : Folate Testing 19 Figure 2 PRISMA flow char t 6.3 Direct from -test-to-health- outcomes evidence No direct evidence was identified, therefore a linked evidence approach was taken. 6.4 Linked evidence: Diagnostic accuracy 6.4.1 Study characteristics One diagnostic cohort study published in 1984 was identified that presented diagnostic accuracy data for RBC folate testing.46 All folate samples sent for RBC folate testing at a tertiary hospital in the UK for Records screened by title and abstract (k=6,654) Records screened by full -text review (k=569) Total included (k=10) Efficacy/effectiveness and safety (k=10) Diagnostic accuracy k=1 Change in management k=8 Safety k=1Duplicates removed (k=1,583) Studies excluded (k=6,085) Studied excluded (k=559) Studies excluded due to: Incorrect study outcome (k=519) Incorrect publication type (k=35) Incorrect language (k=2) Duplicates (k=2) Unable to access (k=1) Identification Screening Eligibility IncludedRecords identified through database searches (k=8,233) Records identified through pearling (k=4) Total (k=8,237) HTA Report : Folate Testing 20 a 2.5- year period from January 1981 were assayed. Patients were assessed as being folate deficient based on a range of haematological and clinical tests including bone marrow aspirate , deoxyuridine suppression test , Schilling test, small bowel biopsy as well as dietary analysis. These tests were the reference standard against which the diagnostic accuracy of RBC test was assessed. Not all patients had all tests. Patients were enrolled in a single cohort , including all assays conducted during the period (indication for testing unspecified) ; a separate group of healthy c ontrols was also included, but has not been included in this group is not eligible for folate testing in practice. The results of the tests were stratified into groups based on the test findings as follows: 1) definitely folate deficient (n = 18) , 2) probably folate deficient (n=7) , 3) definite ly B12 deficient with no reason to suspect folate deficiency (n=35), 4) probably B12 deficien t with no reason to suspect folate deficiency (n=3), 5) macrocytic but not folate deficient ( n = 45 ), and 6) possibly d eficient of both B12 and folic acid (i.e. equivocal results, n=2). The authors did not report how many patients referred for a folate test were included in the analysis. A threshold of 200 mcg/L was used to determine folate deficiency. This was derived from the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval in 200 heathy volunteers. The study is summarised in Table 28, Appe ndix B . 6.4.2 Risk of bias The diagnostic accuracy study was appraised using the QUADAS - 2 tool42 (Table 31, Appendix C ). The study was judged as having an overall high risk of bias because not all patients received the same reference standard. Domain 1 (patient selection) was assessed as having an uncertain risk of bias, owing to the lack of description around the tested cohort . Domain 2 ( index test ) was assessed as having a low risk of bias. Domain 3 (reference standard) was assessed has having an uncertain risk of bias, as it is unclear how likely it is that the reference standard can correctly cl assify the target condition. Risk of bias in domain 4 (flow and timing) was assessed as high due to a failure to report the total number of eligible folate tests received during the period of the study and how many patients were excluded from the analysis. The study also failed to report sufficient details to assess the appropriateness and timing of the reference standard (clinical examination of patients). There are strong concerns with the applicability of the study. Expert advice suggests the method used for folate level determination in the study (i.e. folic acid radioassay) is not representative of modern practice. It is also not clear whether the threshold development method and level determined are appropriate and applicable to modern practice. It is not known whether the indications for folate testing in this study are applicable to current usage, as this was not reported. HTA Report : Folate Testing 21 6.4.3 Results Diagnostic accuracy data were available from a single study.46 It is not clear if the study employed a one-gate (i.e. using a single set of selection criteria) o r multiple -gate (i.e. using multiple sets of selection criteria) design due to inadequate reporting. Bain (1984) reported RBC folate testing had a sensitivity of 96% in patients with known or probable folate deficiency.46 Specificity was 71 % in patients who had a definite or probably B12 defic iency but no reason to suspect a folate deficiency, or macrocyclic haematology but no folate deficiency.46 These results should be interpreted with caution. A clinical expert reported that the folic acid r adioassay is no longer used (personal comment; haematologist). Thus, the results from this study are unlikely to be representative of the accuracy of folate testing occurring in Switzerland today. Serum results are not reported. 6.5 Linked evidence: C hange in management 6.5.1 Study characteristics No comparative evidence on change in management was identified. In total, 8 studies investigating management decisions following folate testing were identified and these are summarised in Table 29, Appendix B . All the studies were either case series in design, or case control studies ; however, relevant data were only extracted from a single arm of the study.47-54 In total, 6 of the studies were conducted in the USA47 49 -53, one study was conducted in Denmark48 and one in Israel54. All the studies retrospectively reviewed results from a consecutive series of folate tests conducted over a specified time period (4 months to 3 years). Regarding test interpretation, 5 studies measured serum folat e using a threshold of 1.5- 3 ng/ml (3.4-6.8 nmol/L ) to indicate deficiency .47 50 -53 An additional study used a serum folate threshold of 5.6 nmol/L (2.5 ng/ml ) to indicate deficiency .54 Of these studies , 3 measured RBC folat e; 2 used a threshold of 175 ng/ml (397 nmol/L)49 50 while one used a threshold of 155 ng/ ml (351 nmol/L) .48 Three of the studies also defined a 'borderline or insuffi cient' folate status and used a range 6.5.2 Risk of bias No change- in-management studies were identified, only case series studies reporting how folate testing informed management decisions were included. These studies are considered at inherently high risk of bias due to the study design. The quality of the 8 case series studies w as appraised using the IHE Quality Appraisal Checklist ( Table 32, Appendix C ). HTA Report : Folate Testing 22 All studies clearl y stated objectives, used consecutive recruitment and measured relevant outcomes using objective methods. Further, all studies established relevant outcome a priori and clearly stated the eligibility criteria. All studies reported appropriate conclusions s upported by the results. Four studies used a multicentre design.48 51 52 54 The major limitation of the evidence base was the retrospective study design used by all studies. Whils t the folate test results are probably at low risk of bias given this is an objective measure (i.e. a recorded value) , the risk of bias regarding the management decision is uncertain. This is owing to the subjectivity and variability that may have occurred with patient chart recording , given it did not follow a predefined protocol. All studies reported some relevant details of the folate test, including the type of folate measurement (RBC or serum) and the threshold used to determine a deficient result, receiving at least a partial score for this criterion. Three studies also reported details of the specific test used (including manufacturer).49 50 53 Competing interests and sources of funding were fully declared by Vinker and Ashaf47 54, partially declared by Sign and Theis en52 53 and not reported by Jaffe (1991), Robinson and Mladenovic (2001), Latif (2004) and Bor (2008).48-51 Follow -up time was unclear for all studies. Eight c riteria (listed below ) were considered not applicable, due to the type of study design and the type of outcome measures reported: Did patient enter the study at a similar point in the disease? Were additional interventions clearly described? Were outcome assessors blinded to the intervention? Were the relevant outcome measures made before and after the intervention? Were the statistical tests used to assess the relevant outcomes appropriate? Were losses to follow -up reported? Did study provide estimates of random variability in the data analysis of relevant outcomes? Were the adverse events reported? 6.5.3 Results No studies reported change in management; data were only available on management decisions following a folate test. All studies reporting management post -folate testing were highly consistent in study methodology and findings.47-54 HTA Report : Folate Testing 23 The detection rates of folate deficiency were low across all studies, ranging from 0.4- 4.9%.47-54 Of patients identified with folate deficiency, the mean rate of subsequent management with supplementation was 46.4% (268/577 patients across all studies, range 24% -62%).47-54 Only Latif (2004) and Bor (2008) reported supplementation rates above 50%, with rates of 62% and 54%, respectively.48 50 Of these studies, 3 reported overall management decisions based on folate testing. Vinker (2013) calculated 1.9% of folate tests resulted in clinician response, Latif (2004) reported 0.9% of patients who were clinically suspected of folate deficiency received supplementation, and Robinson and Mladenovic reported the overall clinical response to folate testing was 0.5%.50 51 54 Robinson and Mladenovic reported only 53% of folate results were recorded and only 24% were attributed to a possible cause.51 Similarly, Bor (2008) reported that only 46% of low folate results were recorded in patient charts.48 Results from Bor (2008) are considered the most applicable to the Swiss context.48 The study was conducted in Denmark, which, similar to Switzerland, does not have mandatory folic acid fortification. Results from this study were consistent with those from other studies, with low rates of folate deficiency detected (1.7% of tests requested by hospital doctors and 1.3% of tests requested by general practitioners) and low rates of supplement initiation when folate deficiency was identified (54%). 6.6 Linked evidence: I mpact of change in management Due to the absence of evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of folate testing and change in management, the impact of change in management was not investigated. 6.7 Safety of folate testing No studies were identified that investigated the safety of folate testing. The testing procedure involves a venepuncture for blood draw, which is a common procedure, therefore it is not expected that there are substantial safety issues involved in the test itself. 6.8 Safety of folic acid supplementation 6.8.1 Study characteristics Under both the intervention and comparator management strategies being investigated for this report, patients would be exposed to folic acid supplementation i f folate deficienc y was suspected or confirmed after testing. Therefore, the safety of supplementation is a key issue to consider. One umbrella review of meta- analyses was identified that examined the association of folate with health outcomes.55 The review pooled results from 154 meta- analyses of RCTs and 133 meta- analyses of HTA Report : Folate Testing 24 observational studies published in the Medline, Embase or Cochrane library databases up to May 2018. The quality of each included meta- analysis was appraised using AMSTAR 2. The studies were grouped by unique health comes and a risk ratio with 95% confidence interval was generated for each. Results from meta-analyses of RCTs and observational studies were reported separately . Where a risk ratio was statistically significant (p < 0.05) a prediction interval and between study heterogeneity was calculated. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group classification was used to assess the quality of the findings. 6.8.2 Risk of bias The umbrella review by Bo (2020) was appraised using a modified version of the AMSTAR 2 assessment tool.41 No validated appraisal tool was identified for appraising umbrella reviews; however, the framework provided by AMSTAR 2 is largely applicable to these types of review and was considered an appropriate c hoice, as the methodology for study identification, selection and extraction are the same as a for a traditional systematic review. Similarly, consideration of the quality appraisal, statistical methods and heterogeneity are important for umbrella reviews, albeit requiring a different methodology for these aspects. The primary limitation of the review , and a source of bias, is that it excluded systematic reviews without meta- analyse s and thus the findings may not reflect the entire evidence base. In addition, it is not clear whether there was overlap of studies in cluded in reviews on the same outcomes, which would result in a misleading, overly precise estimate.56 The review used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; however, this tool was designed for primary studies, not systematic review evidence. It is reported that there is currently no guidance on appropriate use and interpretation of the GRADE tool when assessing the quality of the evi dence base on systematic reviews.56 Other imitations of the review by Bo (2020) were the failure to establish that the review was guided by a protocol and a failure to publish and justify the list of excluded studies. The included systematic reviews' assessment of publication bias was noted; however, this was not discussed or analysed further. Full results of the appraisal are presented in Table 33, Appendix C . 6.8.3 Results An umbrella review of meta -analyses on the association between folate and health outcomes indicated that folic acid supplementation is generally considered to be safe. Synthesis of meta- analyses deemed to be of high or moderate GRADE classification by the author s showed that folic acid suppl ementation was associated with decreased risks of: elective termination of pregnancy for f oetal anomalies, megaloblastic ana emia, neural tube defects, cardiovascular disease (among people with pre- existing diseases, liver toxicity (in patients receiving methotrexate), gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, low HTA Report : Folate Testing 25 predelivery serum folate, decreased scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and levels of plasma homocysteine (both among patients with type 2 diabetes and the general population) increased levels of birth weight, red blood cell folate, and serum/plasma folate. However , folic acid supplementation was associated with higher rates of prostate cancer in patients with pre- existing diseases (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04, 1.49) and colorectal adenoma in the general population (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06, 1.70). 46 The increased risk of colorectal adenoma was in patients who had been on folic acid supplement ation for over three years and this evidence was of serious risk of bias as assessed by AMSTAR 2 and very low quality as assessed by GRADE . For prostate cancer, the result was driven by results from a single study, removal of which resulted in non- significant results. However, it was noted that the study was of low risk of bias and there is no rationale to justify its removal from the analysi s. The authors hypothesised that these inconsistent findings for prostate cancer may therefore represent heterogeneity in the included populations and study design.46 Pooled data from observational studies also showed an association between: periconceptional pregnancy supplementation and child asthma and wheezing (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02, 1.09) early pregnancy folic acid supplementation and child wheezing as an isolated symptom (RR 1.06, RR 1.02, 1.09).55 It should be noted that other measures of the association between maternal folic acid supplementation and infant respiratory symptoms, as listed below, did not reach levels of statistical significance : pregnancy supplementation and child asthma (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99, 1.14) pregnancy supplementation and wheeze (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95, 1.15) pregnancy supplementation other than early pregnancy and wheeze (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96, 1.03) . These results are therefore uncertain, based on meta- analyses of observational data, and should be interpreted with caution. Isolated single cases of anaphylaxis due to folic acid supplementation have been r eported.57-59 However, this is considered extremely rare, with 13 cases described in the literature between 1949 and 2015.58 It has been theorised that increased folic acid intake may mask a vitamin B12 deficiency by correcting macrocy tosis.60-62 However, this is based on observational data62 and results are inconsistent.60 It is unknown whether this is merely a theoretical risk or to what extent increasing supplementation will increase the harms associated with B12 deficiency. A retrospective analysis of laboratory results in the USA reported that the proportion of patients with low B12 concentration but without anae mia did not HTA Report : Folate Testing 26 differ during the periods of pre- and post -folic acid fortification, suggesting no increase in masked B12 deficiency.63 6.9 GRADE summary of findings The overall certainty findings of the key diagnostic accuracy and management outcomes are summarised in Table 9 and Table 10. The GRADE Working Group has defined the following grades of evidence: High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited ; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.44 Diagnostic accuracy outcomes were appraised as having 'very low' certainty . These findings were informed by a single study, at high risk of bias . Further, there were serious concerns about the applicability of the study because the methodology used to determine folate results is outdated and not currently used in clinical practice. There is also uncertainty in the prevalence of folate deficiency in the Swiss population. A single study of 348 women estimated this as being 19.9% in women of childbearing age and 2.8% in pregnant women.9 At the time of collection 19/171 (11%) of the women of reproductive age and 146/177 (83%) of the pregnant women consumed supplements contain ing folate. It is unlikely that the results from this study can be reasonably extrapolated to the wider Swiss population that may undergo folate testing. It is questionable to use the prevalence data in combination with the diagnostic accuracy data, as the methodology for the folate test in the diagnostic accuracy study differs from that used in the prevalence study, and these were measured in different population groups. Therefore, while we have provided an evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of folate testing in Table 9, these results should be interpreted with a very high degree of caution. A single m anagement outcome (rate of supplementation) was appraised using GRADE methodology , as this outcome was repor ted consistently by all management studies and is the key outcome for this section. The certainty of these results was rated 'very low ' due to concerns around study design and risk of bias and concerns around the applicability of the results measured in countries with mandatory supplementation being applied to Switzerland.

A total of 73 hits were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov and 29 hits from the EU Clinical Trials Registry. Of these, no ne were related to the accuracy of RBC or serum folate testing. HTA Report : Folate Testing 29 7 Clinical practice guideline review Summary statement clinical practice guideline review There is a paucity of evidence- based clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on folate testing published since 2017. Recently published guidelines focus primarily on the use of folate testing as part of the perioperative management of patients undergoing bariatric surgery; one other guideline recommended folate testing in patients with progressively worsening gait ataxia. Notably, only one of the guidelines proposed a threshold for interpreting the findings of the test, and the evidence supporting the recommendations were typically either very low (i.e. based on expert opinion), or not reported. One guideline from the Royal College of Pathologists (UK) recommends against repeat folate testing in patients with folate deficiency. 7.1 Methods 7.1.1 Search strategy The systematic literature searches outlined in Section 5.1 were used to identify CPGs related to the use of folate testing. Grey literature searches were also conducted on CPG websites ( Table 25, Appendix A ) and specialty websites ( Table 26, Appendix A ) using combinations CPG'. 7.1.2 Inclusion criteria and study selection The select ion of CPGs was conducted by a single reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Disagreements were settled through discussion. Swiss or international CPGs providing recommendation(s) on the appropriateness of folate testing, or on how management should be guided by test results, were eligible for inclusion. Only guidelines published in English, French, German or Italian were eligible for inclusion. Only CPGs that met all the following criteria, adapted from Graham (2011), were included: 1) contains the word ' guideline' or 'recommendation' in its title or introduction, or contains recommendations on folate testing 2) developed by at least 2 authors 3) developed based on a systematic search of the literature. 64 HTA Report : Folate Testing 30 Guidelines based only on expert opinion were excluded. Only guidelines published after 1 January 2017 were included because guidelines are outdated 5 years after publication.64 65 7.2 Results In total, 5 guidelines met the inclusion criteria ( Table 11).66-70 No Swiss -specific guidelines on folate testing were identified. The included guidelines were published in the UK (k = 2),68 70 North America (k = 2)66 67 and Australia (k = 1).69 There were no general CPGs on folate testing; rather, the identified guidelines focused on the use of folate testing in 2 specific populations: patients undergoing bariatric surgery66 67 69 and patients with suspected neurological deficiency as indicated by progressively worsening gait ataxia.68 One guideline published by the Royal College of Pathologists (UK) specifically recommend ed against repeat folate testing of patients with a folate deficiency.70 Importantly, although these guidelines were drafted based on a systematic review combined with a clinical review, many of the recommendations are either based on low quality evidence, or the evidence underpinning the recommendation was not reported. It is also important to note that only one guideline reported a threshold for identifying a clinically deficient patient, and none of the guidelines recommended a clear timing or frequency of testing and/or fol low-up testing for folate deficiency. It is worth noting that several other guidelines were identified in the searches, which did not meet the inclusion criteria (e.g. published prior to 1 January 2017 or based solely on expert opinion) but offer useful insights into the area. Most notably, the haematology guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders, 23 which was excluded based on publication date, reiterates the fundamental issue with drafting guidelines in this area: \"These guidelines aim to provide an evidence- based approach to the diagnosis and management of cobalamin and folate disorders. However, such evidence, particularly in the form of randomized controlled trials, is lacking. As a result, these guidelines provide a pragmatic approach to the testing and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders, with recommendations based, as far as possible, on the GRADE system... .In the majority of situations, the recommendations inevitably rely more on clinical judgement and consensus than objective laboratory data. \" 23 HTA Report : Folate Testing 31 Table 11 Clinical practice guidelines on serum folate te sting Author; year; country Recommendation for folate testing Strength of evidence Diagnostic threshold Queensland Health, 202169 Australia In overweight and obese pregnant women undergoing bariatric surgery, serum folate testing is recommended at preconception, first trimester, 2nd and 3rd trimester, and lactation (3 monthly) Antenatal care for women with a raised BMI: consider folate deficiency.

HTA Report : Folate Testing 33 8 Budget impact analysis Summary statement budget impact assessment The clinical evaluation found insufficient evidence relating to health outcomes to undertake cost - effectiveness or cost - utility analyses comparing supplementation based on folate testing to supplementation without testing. A budget impact assessment was undertaken to estimate folate testing and treatment payer costs in Switzerland over the next 5 years. The costs of serum and blood cell folate tests increased from CHF 7.9 million in 2016 to CHF 11.7 million in 2020 and the value of fol ic acid treatment has increased from CHF 6.9 million in 2017 to CHF 7.7 million in 2021. Growth rates of testing and treatment volumes over the last 5 years were used t o project costs for 2022- 2026. Based on these assumptions, it is forecast that the combined cost of folate testing and treatment w ill increase from CHF 22.2 million in 2022 to CHF 30.8 million in 2026. 8.1 Methods Value for money analysis of folate testing and treatment was captured in the HTA protocol by 2 key questions. The first , is whether supplementation based on folate testing had superior cost -effectiveness or cost -utility compared to supplementation without testing. It was noted that outcomes would be evaluated by considering existing published literature where available, and a de novo economic evaluation would be conducted if direct test -to-health -outcomes evidence existed. The clinical evaluation found insufficient evidence relating to health outcomes to undertake these types of economic evaluations. The second key question involved estimation of the annual budgetary impact of folate testing and supplementation. It was decided that t his analysis would be conducted regardless of whether a de novo economic evaluation wa s undertaken. The following sections present the budget impact of folate testing and treatment in Switzerland over a projected 5 -year period. The current budget impact is initially outlined, followed by a projection from 2022- 2026. No evidence or applicable clinical practice guidelines (see Section 7) were found that could be used to inform different budget impact scenarios , such as limiting coverage to specific indications. Literature searches of clinical practice guidelines on serum fol ate testing (see Section 7) identified guidance associated with target populations , such as overweight and obese pregnant women prior to bariatric surger y66 67 69 and adults with gradually progress ive unsteady gait .68 Guidance also indicated HTA Report : Folate Testing 34 that repeat measurement of vitamin B12 and folate is unnecessary in patients with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency.70 It is difficult to use guidance associated with these target populations as part of scenarios for restricting folate testing and supplementation. T hey are mostly guidelines for managing risk factors associated with deficiency, rather than folate testing guidelines. 8.2 Results: Current budget impact There are currently no limitations on mandatory insurance coverage of folate tests.1 Serum and blood cell folate tests are reim bursed through mandatory health insurance in Switzerland. A total of 738,164 folate serum tests were ordered in 2020 and 96,445 blood cell tests in the same year. The combined total of tests was 834,609 in 2020, which is a substantial increase (47%) in the total number of tests since 568,416 in 2016 (See Table 12). Most tests are billed by laboratories, which accounted for 86% of claims over this period. There is limited information about the proportion of folate tests undertaken for different indications across Switzerland. Clinical feedback during the assessment suggested that testing related to endocrinology, cardiovascular, ha ematology, oncology, nutrition, transplantation, and internal medicine accounted for large proportions of folate testing in hospitals, and pathological risk factors (e.g., malignancy, haemolytic anaemia, coeliac disease, short bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel syndrome etc.), alcoholism, and bariatric surgery patients in general practice. Given data limitations - along with the large numbers of groups that are tested; wide spread nature of indications and referrers - no quantification of test use by patient group has been calculated.

It is evident that serum ('Blut') costs increased from CHF 6.7 million in 2016 to CHF 9.6 million in 2020. Blood cell folate test costs ('Erythrozyten') increased from CHF 1.2 million to CHF 2.0 million over the same period. The total cost for both types of tests amounted to CHF 11.7 million in 2020. 1 Serum test (1329.00, 'Folat, Blut', cost of 13.1 tax points) and Blood cell (1330.00, 'Folat, Erythrozyten' cost of 21.0 tax points).

The 3 leading folic acid treatment products by Acidum folicum Streuli, and of folic acid treatments across the 2017- 2021 period. The leading product, Acidum folicum Streuli, accounted for nearly half (48%) of all folic acid treatments. The value of folic acid treatment has increased from CHF 6.9 million in 2017 to CHF 7.7 million in 2021. HTA Report : Folate Testing 37 Table 13 Folic acid treatment and costs in Switzerland, 2017 -2021 Number Datenaufbereitung: \u00a9 the b udgetary impact analysis Folate testing and treatment has increased in Switzerland over the last 5 years. Future projections outlined in Table 14 include the growth rates observed over the last 5 years. In the case of folate testing , serum tests are assumed to increase by 10% per year ; blood cell folate tests by 14% per year. Based on these assumptions, the number of serum tests increases from 893,179 in 2022 to 1,307,703 in 2026. Blood cell tests increase to 211,694 by 2022. Estimates for 2022- 2026 are presented in Table 14. The overall projected costs of testing increase from CHF 14.2 million in 2022 to CHF Acidum folicum Streuli and Andreafol folic acid treatments are estimated to increase by 8% and 2% per year, respectively, based on reported growth over the last 5 years. Gyno Tardyferon treatments are assumed to decrease by 8% per year based on the numbers over the last 5 years. Other treatments are assumed to grow by 3% per year , based on 5 years of data. It is estimated there will be 525,887 fol ic acid treatments in 2026 based on these assumptions. The projected payer cost of folic acid treatment HTA Report : Folate Testing 38 for Switzerland increases from CHF 7.9 million in 2022 to CHF 9.3 million in 2026. The combined cost of testing and treatment w ill increase from CHF 22.2 million in 2022 to CHF 30.8 million in 2026.

No studies reporting legal issues were identified. Most studies identified addressed organisational issues relating to methods of test restriction; h owever , none discussed the implications of reducing test availability , including how folate deficiency would be diagnosed by physicians in the absence of a folate test. Ethical issue s identified included potential adverse events from taking folic acid supplement s if not actually folate deficient , which could occur with a false positive test or an incorrect diagnosis by a clinician in the absence of a test . Studies on s ocial issues were in relation to physicians ' opinions and concerns regarding an initiative to reduce folate test orders , which were mostly supportive, and citizens ' opinions on test disinvestment. 9.1 Literature search strategy 9.1.1 Databases and other sources A literature search for studies reporting ethical, legal, social and organisational issues associated with folate testing was conducted in PubMed and Embase (OVID). In addition, studies included in the clinical section of this report were pearled for citations relating to these auxiliary domains. Grey literature searches were also conducted on specialty and HTA websites ( Table 26 and Table 27, Appendix A ) Inclusion and exclusion criteria Table 8 (Section 4.5) describes the populations, interventions and comparators that were applied. 9.2 Data extraction, analysis and synthesis 9.2.1 Study selection The targeted search for studies reporting on ethical, legal, social and organisational issues associated with folate testing was conducted by a single reviewer. A PRISMA chart was not provided owing to the use of systematic and non- systematic searches. HTA Report : Folate Testing 40 9.2.2 Data extraction One reviewer independently extract ed data into a standardised template, which was checked against the original study record by a second reviewer. D isagreements were settled by discussion or by a third independent reviewer. Data of interest include d: study information: country, year, study design, research question, inclusion/exclusion criteria demographic information: number of participants, age, sex , comorbidities, indication for testing outcomes of interest: results relating to ethical, legal, social or organisational issues any noteworthy features, limitations or differences in the study. 9.2.3 Data synthesis The results of the included studies were described narratively , per 'ELSO' domain . 9.3 Results A total of 8 studies , published between 2015 and 2021, were identified for inclusion.31 55 72-77 Of these, 4 were from Canada,31 73-75 plus one each from Australia,76 Saudi Arabia ,72 Turkey77 and China.55 9.3.1 Ethical issues Ethical concerns identified relate to the potential adverse events that can occur with folic acid supplementation. This is releva nt in situations where a patient is given a supplement based on an 'incorrect ' folate test diagnosis (i.e. false positive ), and also if the test were disinvested and patients are incorrectly given a supplement based on a clinician' s suspicion of folate deficiency when not deficient . An umbrella review that included meta- analyses of RCTs on folic acid supplementation reported that folic acid supplements are generally considered to be safe, but are associated with an increased risk of colorectal ade noma in the general population and prostate cancer in people with pre-existing diseases (Table 15).55 The authors hypothesised that for the association between folate and increased risk of colorectal adenoma the most likely explanation is that undiscovered early precursor lesions might have existed in the mucosa of these patient s and folate could have accelerated the proliferation and growth of the paraneoplastic lesions.55 The review also found an association between periconceptional pregnancy supplementation and child asthma and wheezing and early pregnancy folic acid supplementation and child wheezing. However, it should be noted that these associations were from observational study data, and the likelihood of patients being given s upplements unnecessarily is unclear owing to the limited diagnostic accuracy of folate testing.

Abbreviations NR = not reported; RCTs = randomised controlled trials. 9.3.2 Legal issues No studies were identified that addressed legal issues for folate testing. 9.3.3 Social issues Two studies reporting social issues were identif ied; one each reporting physician and citizen opinions on disinvestment of folate testing , respectively (Table 17). Physician views on disinvestment from folate testing One study, by Ismail (2019), described an initiative to reduce the number of folate tests ordered across 2 centres in Canada (described below in organisational issues) and provided some detail on the opinion of physicians on test restriction.31 The study audited folate tests over a 18- month period and identified 111 physicians who had ordered 5 or more tests during this time. These physicians were contacted via email and informed of the centres' plan to restrict testing by requiring biochemist approval of all future folate tests. They were also given the opportunity to provide feedback. Only 38 physicians responded, 34 of whom did not have an issue with test restriction and 4 who voiced concerns for particular patient groups, including those with coeliac disease, gastric bypass or severe anorexia, and immigrants from countries where folic acid fortification does not take place. It is difficult to make assumptions based on this limited information; however, most physicians responding to the survey felt the changes to folate test ordering were appropriate. 31 HTA Report : Folate Testing 42 Citizen views on disinvestment from fola te testing One Australian study reported citizens ' perspectives on disinvestment from publicly funded pathology tests .76 Disinvestment of vitamin B12/folate was used to shape the debate and the forum was informed by a systematic review of B12/folate pathology test effectiveness and expert testimony. The forum consisted of 10 participants; half were men and ages ranged from 20 to 66 years. The citizens identified 7 criteria they deemed as important to inform the prioritisation of potential test disinvestment. Their general opinions relating to these criteria are summarised below ( Table 16). A comparison of the criteria devised by the citizen forum and those dev ised by an expert group was made. There was considerable coherence between the 2 groups. The major differences being that the citizens did not consider equity issues, whilst the expert group did not consider the cost of the social and emotional impact of disinvestment on users and society. 55 Table 16 Citizens ' perspe ctives on criteria d eemed important to inform the prioritisation of potential test disinvestment Citizen criteria Opinions expressed Cost of test Participants agreed that the cost of the test was a central point to consider for potential disinvestment . Emphasis was placed on high cost per procedure with little emphasis on cost by volume. Overall cost was an impetus for action. Potential benefit High potential for benefit was considered as worthy of funding . Equal value was generally given for quality of life and extension of life. The possibility of test exclusion was expressed where the condition is related to lifestyle choices. Costs to the community of not testing Attention was given to the ongoing cost to the community of doing nothing (financial cost to the health system and emotional cost to individuals and family) . Public good Public good was frequently prioritised over individual benefit in many of the arguments raised by participants. Alternatives to testing The participants agreed that having alternatives to testing was an important criterion. One member suggesting that pre- emptive treatment may be a solution. Disease severity The severity of the ill ness played a crucial role in participants ' understanding of whether a test should be funded. Accuracy Accuracy was included as one o f 4 primary criteria to consider for disinvestment decisions but was rarely considered in isolation from the other criteria. In addition to developing a set of criteria relating to disinvestment of test s, the participants discussed the natur e of a disinvestment process . The authors noted that some participants questioned whether policymakers had the authority to make these clinical decisions or whether the responsibility should lie with general practitioners , either supporte d by a set guideline or monitored through auditing. Suggestions regarding potential ways of disinvesting included tighter guidelines or descriptors for administering the test along with education and treatment strategies that would avoid the need to test.76 HTA Report : Folate Testing 43 Table 17 Characteristics of included studies for social issues Author, year; country Population; sample size Design; follow -up; setting; mandatory fortification Aim of study Results Ismail 201931; Canada RBC folate requests (inpatients and outpatients) from 2 centres from Oct 2015- Apr 2018; n = 3,299 Pre-test post-test study (case series) ; 10 months; London Health Sciences Centre and St Joseph's Healthcare London; Yes Review RBC folate tests ordered over a 18- month period (Oct 2015- Mar 2017) and implement a quality improvement initiative to reduce test numbers. The initiative included identifying physicians who had ordered 5 folate tests in the previous 18 months and providing them with education (over email) and informing them of the institution's intention to limit testing moving forward. Physicians were given the opportunity to provide their feedback on this. 111 physicians were identif ied as ordering 5 tests and were contacted. 38 responded (34 with no major concerns and 4 with concerns for patient groups such as those with coeliac disease, gastric bypass, severe anorexia, or immigrants from countries without folic acid fortification).

Citizens identified 7 criteria of importance: cost of the test; potential impact on individual health/capacity to benefit, potential cost to society; public good; alternatives to testing; severity of the condition; accuracy of the test. (Their perspectives on these are described in more detail in Table 16). Citizens also questioned the \"authority\" of policymakers to make disinvestment decisions. Abbreviations NA = not applicable; RBC = red blood cell . 9.3.4 Organisational issues There were 6 studies identif ied that discussed organisational issues relating to methods to restrict or reduce folate testing.31 72 -75 77 The characteristics and main findings of these studies are reported in Table 18. It should be noted that whilst the studies discussed how restrictions to folate testing were implemented or could be implemented, none of the studies reported how physicians would make a clinical diagnosis of folate deficiency if folate testing was not available. The studies that implemented restrictions noted cost savings to their institutions relating to folate testing; h owever, the cost implications of using other tests in lieu of folate testing are not known. As a result, the organisational implications for clinical laboratories that may have to perform an increased number of other tests is also unknown . HTA Report : Folate Testing 44 Appropriateness of testing Three studies suggested patient groups in which folate testing could be limited to avoid unnecessary testing .31 72- 74 Alkhaldy (2020) defined the clinical criteria for testing as the presence of macrocytic anaemia, pancy topenia or bicytopenia. In their study, less than 50% of folate tests ordered met t hese clinical criteria .72 Both Gudgeon (2015) and Ismail (2019) suggested specific circumstances for folate testing were suspected severe nutritional deficiency or malabsorption.31 73 Whilst making recommendations regarding specific circumstances or criteria for folate testing, the studies did not discuss how these recommendations could be implemente d or monitored within a healthcare system. Bundling of tests Alkhaldy (2020) noted that folate tests tended to be bundled with vitamin B12 and ferritin t esting , result ing in both increased costs and time loss. The authors suggested that informing physicians of the low incidence of folate deficiency and changing laboratory processes, such as storage of samples, may reduce unnecessary folate tests.72 Interventions used to restrict folate testing Four studies described interventions to restrict folate test ordering ; all of which resulted in significant reductions in test numbers , and associated costs, over the ir study period .31 74 75 77 These are described in detail in Table 18 and are briefly summarised below : Providing physicians with education regarding the low prevalence of folate deficiency and of evidence- based medicine practices .31 77 Adding a 'pop- up window' to the computerised ordering system, which state s that folate tests should only be ordered in cases of suspected severe nutritional deficiency or malabsorption and that approval of the test by an on- call biochemist was required.31 Limiting the ability to request folate tests via the computerised ordering system to clinicians in gastroenterology and haematology departments only (other departments could only order via written or telephone request to the laboratory ).74 Complete removal of serum and RBC fola te tests from standard laboratory requisition requests so that request s could only be made in writing .75 Providing monthly laboratory -use reports to departments (including information on test numbers and costs per patient) .77 Rearranging computerised test ordering systems , such that frequently ordered tests were on the second p age.77 Forbidding the use of test panels .77 HTA Report : Folate Testing 45 Table 18 Characteristics of included studies for organisational issues Author, year; country Population; sample size Design; follow -up; setting; mandatory fortification Aim of study ; Intervention Results Conclusions Alkhaldy 202072; Saudi Arabia Serum f olate requests at single centre from Jul 2018- Jun 2019; n = 614 Retrospective chart review ; NR; Aseer Central Hospital ; Yes (flour) Analyse the clinical appropriateness of ordering serum folate tests ; NA Most common indication (where reported) for testing was anaemia (51%) in 2.8% of cases - rate of low folate was NS between anaemic and non-anaemic patients . Criteria for serum folate testing were not met in approximately 50% of the tests performed. Bundling of tests (presumably to save time to diagnosis and mul tiple blood extractions) occurred; however, it is i nappropriate to order multiple tests without considering aetiology of anaemia. Multiple tests increase costs and time lost. Education and laboratory protocols (such as storage of samples) could reduce unnecessary folate test requests. HTA Report : Folate Testing 46 Author, year; country Population; sample size Design; follow -up; setting; mandatory fortification Aim of study ; Intervention Results Conclusions Gudgeon 201573; Canada RBC folate requests at 3 centres from 1 Jan-31 Dec 2010; n = 2,563 Retrospective chart review ; NR; 3 academic hospitals (Toronto General Hospital; Toronto Western Hospital; Princess Mar garet Hospital) ; Yes Review inpatients with folate deficiency to determine the indication for testing and aetiology of deficiency ; NA 4/2,563 (0.16%) of tests were folate deficient (<254 nmol/L [<112 ng112ng/ml ]) Of the 4 patients with folate deficiency, one test result was considered an error and the aetiology of the remaining 3 included alcohol abuse (n = 1) , malabsorption syndrome (n = 1) and decreased oral intake due to schizophrenia (n = 1). All 3 patients with folate deficiency were anaemic but only 2/3 had elevated corpuscular volume. No blood films suggested megaloblastic anaemia. At a cost of $ 12.54 per test, $32,140 per year could be saved at this institution if folate testing was restricted. Since the incidence of folate deficiency in inpatients is very low , significant cost savings could be achieved by restricting folate testing. Additional savings could be achieved if outpatient testing was als o restricted. Specific circumstances for folate testing may include malabsorption and starvation. Folate deficiency as an aetiology of anaemia should be de- emphasised in Canadian medical training given its very low incidence (in countries where mandatory f ortification occurs). HTA Report : Folate Testing 47 Author, year; country Population; sample size Design; follow -up; setting; mandatory fortification Aim of study ; Intervention Results Conclusions Ismail 201931; Canada RBC folate requests (inpat ients and outpatients) from 2 centres from Oct 2015- Apr 2018 ; n = 3, 299 Pre-test post-test study (case series) ; 10 months; London Health S ciences Centre and St Joseph's Healthcare London; Yes Review RBC folate tests ordered over an 18- month period (Oct 2015- Mar 2017) and implement a quality improvement initiative to reduce test numbers. The initiative included identifying physicians who had ordered 5 folate tests in the previous 18 months and providing them with education (over email) . This included information on the low incidence of folate deficiency in the previous 18 months and the institution' s intention to limit testing moving forward. P hysicians were given the opportunity to provide feedback. Three months later, introduction of a pop- up within the computerised test order ing system stating biochemist approval was required for folate testing took place. Initial retrospective chart review identified 0 cases of folate deficiency from the 3,019 tests ordered in the 18-month period. 111 physician s were identified as ordering 5 tests and were emailed education. 38 responded (34 with no major concerns and 4 with concerns for patient groups such as those with coeliac disease, gastric bypass, severe anorexia, or immigrants from countries without folic acid fortification). The number of tests post - education was 255 (none of which identified folate deficiency) and the number of tests post -pop-up was 25 (2 of which indicated folate deficiency according to the testing site's reference interval but not according to WHO's definition). Overall , the mean number of tests per month pre- intervention was 168 (20 SD). This was significantly reduced to 128 (1 SD) after physician education (p < 0.01) and further reduced to 3 (2 SD) after introduction of the biochemist approval process (p < 0.01). Monthly costs of testing reduced by 95% following the im plementation of the centres' intervention. Even taking into consideration the increased cost associated with moving testing off -site. HTA Report : Folate Testing 48 Author, year; country Population; sample size Design; follow -up; setting; mandatory fortification Aim of study ; Intervention Results Conclusions MacMillan 201874; Canada RBC folate tests at a large academic healthcare network from Jan 2010- Dec 2016; n = 21,402 tests Pre-test post-test study (case series) ; total reduction in test number was estimated for 43 months post- implementation of the intervention; large academic healthcare network in Toronto, Canda; Yes The ability to request RBC testing was restricted in the computerised physician order entry part of an electronic health record to clinician s in gastroenterology and haematology and was removed from other physicians ' computerised order entry screen in June 2013. Clinicians who were not specialist in haematology or gastroenterology could still request RBC folate vi a paper requisition or telephone call to the laboratory. In the pre- intervention period 57/20,214 (0.28%) of RBC folate tests met the defici ency compared with 6/1,188 (0.51%) post-intervention. Assuming a stable rate of RBC folate deficiency over time this suggest that 1. 25 cases per month of RBC deficiency were possibly missed due to the intervention, assuming the test is correct . RBC folate test numbers decreased by 94.4% from a mean of 493.0 (SD 48.0) tests per month before the intervention to 27.6 (SD 10.3) test per month after the intervention (p < 0.001) . Restricting RBC folate test s resulted in a large and sustained reduction in RBC folate testing with significant cost savings and without significant clinical impact on the diagnosis RBC deficiency. HTA Report : Folate Testing 49 Author, year; country Population; sample size Design; follow -up; setting; mandatory fortification Aim of study ; Intervention Results Conclusions Mohammed- Ali 202175; Canada RBC and serum folate tests from 6 family medicine units from Sept 2018- Sept 2019 ; n = NR (study looked at multiple test s and the number of folate tests was not reported) Pre-test post-test study (case series) ; 6 months post-implementation of the intervention; 6 family medicine units ; Yes To improve test utilisation by 6 family medicine units by revis ing standard laboratory requisition requests . Historical laboratory requisitions were reviewed and modified by a steering committee of family medicine physicians , laboratory medicine specialists and a quality improvement specialist. Decisions were made by consensus. Tests were removed from the requisition if there was evidence in the literature of overuse, if they we re outdated or if there was consensus that they were infrequently needed in a family practice . Tests that were removed from the requisition remained orderable by longhand (both serum and RBC tests were removed). Outpatient monthly laboratory test volumes f or 20 tests were extracted. The volume of tests pre - and 6 months post-implementation were compared. A significant reduction in the volume of folate tests ordered was observed (serum folate, 87.2% reduction; 0.001) . The monthly cost of serum folate testing dropped by 87.1% and the monthly cost of RBC testing dropped by 76.9% . Revision of a family medicine laboratory requisition was an effective strategy to decrease unnecessary RBC testing, resulting in significant cos t savings .

A review of how various laboratory tests were used and whether their use was appropriate according to the guidelines or literature. A systematic literature revie w was also performed to identify strategies used to improve laboratory efficiency . The barriers which could block the process during its implementation and possible solutions were discussed by a committee. Strategies implemented included: 1) Education of clinicians about evidence- based practice through hospital meetings. 2) A laboratory use report including test ordered per patient and costs was sent to each department monthly. 3) The computerised test ordering page was rearranged. Test s ordered more than expected or misused In the 12 months following implementation of the strategies in March 2013, there was a 67.7% reduction in. the number of folate tests ordered Hospital -based committees that include laboratory professionals and clinicians can lead to a standardised approach to test use that can help clinicians considerably reduce laboratory costs through appropriate use of laboratory tests.

HTA Report : Folate Testing 52 10 Additional issues 10.1 Defining folate deficiency A complicating factor regarding the diagnostic accuracy of folate testing, as not ed in the guidelines by Devalia (2014 ),23 is that there is no consensus on the cut -off to define deficiency ( Section 2).23 Specifically, Devalia (2014 )23 state s: 'There is no clear consensus on the level of serum folate that indicates def iciency. Conventionally, clinicians have used serum folate lower than 7 nmol/l (3 \u00b5g/l) as a guideline because the risk of megaloblastic anaemia greatly increases below this level. However, there is a sizeable \"indeterminate zone\" (between approximately 7 and 10 nmol/l [3 and 4.5 \u00b5g/l]). Therefore, a low serum folate level should be taken as suggestive of deficiency rather than as a highly sensitive diagnostic test. ' 23 10.2 Test variability Adding to the uncertainty regarding the diagnostic accuracy of folate testing are several publications noting variability in the results obtained with different commercially available competi tive protein binding assays used for folate testing. A recent comparison of 4 different immunoassays and a rapid isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay reported t hat the consistency of results among the evaluated assays for serum folate was worrisome. It was further stated that most method differences among the evaluated assays exceeded the acceptable quality specifications.35 This issue has been highlighted in a recent revi ew by Ferraro (2022)28 who noted critical issues regarding marketed serum folate assays , specifically that the assessment of folate status changes depending on the assay used. They report ed that folate thresholds as a measure of overt folate deficiency may vary by approximately 50% across different assays and/or by using the WHO recommended value as baseline.28 While the type of folate assays used in Switzerland to determine serum or RBC folate are not reported on the FOPH List of Analyses , it is reported that these competitive protein binding assays are the type most commonly used . As summarised by Ferraro (2022) ,28 inaccurate test results can result in higher healthcare costs and increased risks to patients by causing additional tests to be conducted or unnecessary supplementation. In situations where folate status is overestimated , the patient may not be prescribed folic acid supplementation when it is required. The authors suggest the adoption of method- dependent thresholds is crucial to personalise folic acid supplementation and improve the risk - benefit ratio.28 HTA Report : Folate Testing 53 10.3 Appropriateness of testing Owing to concerns regarding the appropriateness of folate testing, several recent studies have looked at either the appropriateness of folate test requests and/or the implementation of different strategies to ensure appropriate test reques ts.31 72 74 These studies have been summarised in Table 18 (Section 9). It should be noted that these studies were from countries that have mandatory folic acid fortification . In addition , a recent review on folate testing in European countries by Ferraro (2 017)8 note that folate tests are inappropriate when there is no specific risk condition/suspicion for folate deficiency/inadequate status, the subject is undergoing or has recently undergone folic acid supplementation, and for retesting at 3- 6 months to evaluate the actual correction of the deficit aft er intake discontinuation.8 Limiting folate testing based on specific criteria might be viewed as a method for restricting unnecessary folate testing; however , basing testing on clinical indications (e.g. haematocrit, mean corp uscular volume, h aemoglobin, transferrin ) does not appear to be useful . Latif ( 2004) (Section 6.6) reported that clinical indications are not helpful in determining folate- defici ent patients . In their chart review comparing indications for testing among individuals with low serum folate levels values with those with normal levels , no differences in the indications for testing were found between the 2 groups .50 Similarly, Vinker (2013) (Section 6.6) concluded that neither laboratory findings nor clinical findings were capable of distinguishing folate- deficient patients from a separately matched control group of patients.54 If folate test ing is limited or withdrawn, clinicians might choose to order the homocysteine test, which is on the Analysenliste, in order to help determine if a patient is folate deficient. It should be noted this test is more expensive than serum and RBC folate tests. 10.4 Patient outcomes potentially associated with folate testing Due to the paucity of data on the diagnostic accuracy of folate testing and a reported failure of test results to impact management decisions , a formal assessment of patient outcomes resulting from a change in management due to folate testing could not be undertaken. However, the implications of the intervention and comparator on patient outcomes has been considered and are discussed here. It is important to note that while the broad implications of each outcome have been discussed, it is not possible to quantify the relative ratio of patients who would fall into each group; therefore, the relative safety and effectiveness of the intervention and comparator cannot be assessed. The diff erences in approach between the intervention and comparator are summarised in Table 19. HTA Report : Folate Testing 54 Table 19 Description of treatments approaches for intervention and comparator strategies for patients indicated for a folate test Treatment Intervention - folate testing and management dependent on results Folic acid supplementation without prior testing Folic acid supplement Patients with a true pos itive or false pos itive test result a All patientsb No folic acid supplement Patients with a true negative or false negative test result No patientsb Notes a = change i n management data indicate not all patients with a pos itive result wil l receive a supplement ; b = actual rates of supplementation i n this group are not known. 10.4.1 Intervention: Folate testing True positives Under the intervention strategy, patients identified as having a folate deficiency would be provided with a folic acid supplement and would therefore receive the benefits of folic acid supplementation and be exposed to the associated risks. However, we not e that the change in management suggests that, even with a clinical suspicion of folate deficiency to warrant a test and a subsequent result indicat ing deficiency, only ~50% of patients receive a supplement. 47-54 Effectiveness of folic acid supplementation In their umbrella review, Bo (2020) found high- or moderate- quality (RCT) evidence that folic acid supplementation was associated with a number of improved health outcomes , including a reduction in : terminations due to foetal abnormalities (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15, (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18, 0.62) cardiovascular disease (among patients with pre-existing disease) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90, 0.99) liver toxicity (patients receiving methotrexate) (RR 95% 95% CI 0.44, 0.89) Hamilton Depress ion Rating Scale score (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00, 0.51) Risks of folic acid supplementation As described under safety of folic acid supplementation (Section 6.7). False positives Patients incorrectly diagnosed as being folate deficient would be exposed to the risks of folic acid supplementation described above. HTA Report : Folate Testing 55 True negative s Patients correctly identified as not having folate deficiency would avoid unnecessary supplementation. False negative s Patients incorrectly identified as having normal folate levels may experience a delay to diagnosis , or may not be diagnosed, and are subject to the associated risks of continued folate deficiency. Natural history of folate deficiency No stud ies investigating the impact of a delayed diagnosis or natural history of folate deficiency were identified. However, it is established that folate defi cienc y is associated with serious health conditions: Folate defic iency leads to an increase in the risk of neural tube defect and the use of pre- conception supplements can reduce this risk by 40 -80%.78 Untreated f olate deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemia and pancytopenia.79 80 Folate is known to lower plasma homocysteine, which is associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke.10 78 10.4.2 Comparator: Supplementation without prior folate testing Under the comparator as defined for this HTA, it is assumed all patients with a suspicion of folate deficiency would be recommended to take a supplement ; however, no evidence was identified that explored the likelihood of this occurring in clinical practice. Management data suggests most patients referred for a folate test will have normal folate levels. Therefore, these patients may be prescribed folic acid they don't require, and will be exposed to the potential harms of folic acid supplementation . HTA Report : Folate Testing 56 11 Discussion The main aim of this HTA report was to determine the benefits and harms of folate testing prior to folic acid supplementation in an asymptomatic general population and in patients with suspected folate deficiency , compared to supplementation without prior folate testing. In addition, the ethical legal and social issues associated with folate testing and the financ ial implications of removing folate testing were examined. The 2 types of folate tests evaluated were serum and RBC folate, as these are currently reimbursed by mandatory health insurance in Switzerland. No direct evidence on folate testing was identified, necessitating a linked evidence approach. Overall, there is a lack of evidence on folate testing to inform policy decision- making, with one outdated study on the diagnostic accuracy and no studies on change in management . Adding to the uncertainty regarding folate test accuracy is the lack of consensus regarding a cut-off value to define folate deficiency , the fact that the assessment of folate status seems to change in relation to the analytical platform used, and an absence of CPGs informing the recommended use of folate testing in the studied populations. 11.1 Comparison to prior HTA reports on folate testing Four HTA reports were identified by grey literature searches and pearling, 3 from Canada and one from Australia. The most recent of these, published in 2022 by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) 81, is an update of their 2015 report82 on folate testing. Anot her recent Canadian HTA, published in 2020, is by the National Institute of Excellence in Health and Social Science (INNESS)83 on erythrocyte folate assay. The Austr alian Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) published their Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) review of folate testing in 2014.84 A report by the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC , Canada) , published in 2013 , was described in the above HTAs but could not be accessed; it is also not clear if this is an HTA. The 3 HTAs which could be retrieved are summarised below: CADTH (2022; 2015): The 2015 Rapid Response Report reviewed both database and grey literature evidence from January 2010 to June 2015. The 2022 HTA search dates were January 2015 to February 2022 (with studies identified in the 2015 report excluded). The 2022 HT A was unable to identify any relevant literature regarding the diagnostic accuracy, clinical utility or cost - effectiveness of serum folate testing in people suspected of folate deficiency. The review also failed to identify any evidence- based CPGs on the use of serum folate testing. CADTH concluded that in the absence of evidence, conclusions could not be drawn, and the creation of guidelines was precluded. 81 82 HTA Report : Folate Testing 57 INNESS (2020): A 2020 report by INNESS assessed the clinical utility of RBC folate testing. Databases were searched from January 2015 to January 2019 for relevant studies, whilst searches for CPGs were conducted from 2010 to July 2019. A decision was made by clinical experts, taking into consideration the scientific evidence, that some clinical situations require measurement of RBC folate (i.e. when serum test results are ambiguous or when it is suspected that recent nutritional intake may be masking deficiency when serum testing alone is used) . As such, it was recommended that the ability to order this analysis by means of a special prescription or shipment out side Quebec should be kept. The report did not discuss the diagnostic accuracy of the test.83 MSAC (2014): This review searched both database and grey literature fr om January 2002 to June 2013 to determine the appropriate indications for folate testing, if folate testing improves health outcomes, the risks/harms of folate testing and if test quality varied between testing platforms. MSAC concluded that few guidelines recommending folate testing were identified. O f the 2 that were, one recommended folate testing as part of a basic dementia screening process and the other did not recommend folate testing in chronic fatigue/myalgic encephalomyelitis patients unless a ful l blood count and MCV showed macrocytosis. The review concluded there was no prospective evidence regarding the clinical utility of folate testing in any patient population or evidence regarding the risks/harms of folate testing. Based on poor evidence, the authors also concluded that serum folate appears the best test option with regards to cost and clinical information. Additionally, given the exceptionally low utility of serum folate testing, the costs associated with them are excessive. 84 Overall, the findings of these existing HTAs are consistent with those of the current report. There is a lack of evidence available to determine the effectiveness and safety of folate testing. 11.2 Limitations Limitations of the diagnostic accuracy evidence The main limitation to the evidence is that it is based on one study that used a radioassay to determine RBC folate, which is reportedly no longer used by clinical laboratories today (personal comment, haematologist) . Thus, the results from this study are unlikely to be representative of the accuracy of folate testing occurring in Switzerland today. Further, it had a mostly unclear -to-high risk of bias due to the paucity of reporting within the study . Limitations of the change in management evidence There is uncertainty regarding the applicability to the Swiss population of the studies reporting on management decisions following folate testing , particularly with respect to the percentage of patients HTA Report : Folate Testing 58 that are diagnosed as folate deficient, as 7 of the 8 studies were from countries with mandatory folic acid fortification. Furthermore, the serum folate thresholds used in the studies to thresholds were 175 ng/ml (397 nmol/L) in 2 studies and 155 ng/ml (351 nmol/L) in the other. Another uncertainty of the study applicability relates to the setting of the studies. Six of the 7 studies were conducted in a hospital setting , one was based in primary care clinics , and the remaining study was a mixture of hospital and general practition er requ est data. SASIS data shows that most folate tests ordered in Switzerland are coded as being claimed by laboratories. It is unclear from where most of these have originated (e.g. originally ordered by general practitioner or by hospitals). The management of patients treated by specialists in a hospital setting may be different to what would occur in a general practice setting. In addition, whether patients would be managed differe ntly by Swiss hospitals and general practitioners (i.e. more or all patients diagnosed as deficient given supplementation) is not known. All the studies were retrospective case series and thus at high risk of bias based on their study design; however, all were consistent in their findings of low rates of folate deficiency being detected and low rates of supplementation even when deficiency was identified. Limitations of the safety evidence There is some uncertainty regarding t he significant finding for prostate cancer as it was driven by results from a single study which might indicate heterogeneity in the included populations . The colorectal adenomatous lesion finding was in patients who had been on folate supplementation for over three years and the meta- analyses was deemed to be of very low quality as assessed by GRADE . The association of folic acid supplementation prior to and during pregnancy with child wheezing and as thma was based on observational studies and thus should be interpreted with caution. Limitations of the budget impact analysis A budget impact analysis has been undertaken to estimate folate testing and treatment payer costs in Switzerland over the next 5 years. Projected growth rates in the volumes of testing and treatment were based on historical annual volume growth. A more acc urate calculation would be based on epidemiological data outlining the size of subpopulations of Swiss patients who could avail testing and folic acid treatment, along with the potential for future uptake being calculated. The clinical evaluation has found insufficient evidence relating to health outcomes to undertake economic analyses that compare supplementation based on folate testing to supplementation without testing. This lack of evidence, along with an absence of applicable clinical practice guidance, has limited the identification of appropriate subpopulations that could be used in budget impact delisting scenarios. HTA Report : Folate Testing 59 12 Conclusions Due to a lack of evidence, this report is limited in its ability to make conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of folate testing prior to folic acid supplementation in an asymptomatic general population, and in patients with suspected folate deficiency due to the presence of symptoms, underlying medical disorders, or external factors, compared to supplementation without prior testing. This finding is consistent with previous HTAs. No ongoing clinical trials were identified that are likely to fill this evidence gap in the near future . Irrespective of the lack of diagnostic accuracy data regarding folate testing, and the uncertainty raised in the literature about folate tes ting, it appears that test results have limited influence on patient management. However, it should be noted that this conclusion is based on low quality evidence, with questionable applicability to the Swiss context. With respect to supplement ation without prior testing, an examination of the literature suggests that the likelihood of adverse events occurring in patients who are not deficient but are given a supplement are low but include rare cases of anaphylaxis , as well as a possible increased risk of prostate cancer, colorectal adenomatous lesions and childhood asthma and wheezing.55 Childhood asthma and wheezing is associated with maternal folic acid intake.55 No natural history studies were identified to inform what would happe n to deficient patients who do not receive a supplement (due to no testing or a false negative test result) ; however , reviews on folate deficiency indicate an association between untreated folate deficiency and megaloblastic anaemia , pancytopenia and increased homocysteine levels (associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke) . The most recognised and studied adverse event relat ed to folate deficiency is neural tube defect.85 Based on the limited evidence for the clinical effectiveness of folate testing, scenarios based on changes to reimbursement policy around folate testing could not be modelled. Assuming no change to the existing reimbursement arrangements, the budget ary impact of folate testing and supplementation is projected to increase from CHF 22.2 million in 2022 to CHF 30.8 million in 2026 .
