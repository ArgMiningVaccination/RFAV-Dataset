The essential oil was screened in vitro against breast cancer cells, normal cell lines, -glucosidase, carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II), free radical scavenging and in vivo analgesic and anti-inflammatory capabilities. The GC-MS screening revealed that the ELEO comprises sixty compounds (95.25%) with the dominant constituents being camphene (16.41%), thunbergol (15.33%), limonene (4.29%), eremophilene (3.77%), and -eudesmol (3.51%). A promising antidiabetic capacity was noticed with an IC50 of 9.63 \u00b1 0.22 g/mL by the ELEO as equated to acarbose with an IC50 = 377.71 \u00b1 1.34 g/mL, while a 162.82 \u00b1 1.24 g/mL inhibition was observed against CA-II. Regarding breast cancer, the ELEO offered considerable cytotoxic capabilities against the triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines, having an IC50 = 183.8 \u00b1 1.6 g/mL. Furthermore, the ELEO was also tested with the human breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cell line, and the findings also presumed that the ELEO did not produce any damage to the tested normal cell lines. The ELEO was effective against the Gram-positive bacteria and offered a 19.8 \u00b1 0.02 mm zone of inhibition (ZOI) against B. atrophaeus. At the same time, the maximum resistance with 18.03 \u00b1 0.01 mm ZOI against the fungal strain Aspergillus parasiticus was observed among the tested fungal strains. An appreciable free radical significance was observed via the DPPH assay with an IC50 = 133.53 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b5g/mL as equated to the ABTS assay having an IC50 = 154.93 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5g/mL. The ELEO also offered a substantial analgesic capacity and produced 58.33% inhibition in comparison with aspirin, a 68.47% decrease in writhes, and an anti-inflammatory capability of 65.54% inhibition, as equated to the standard diclofenac sodium having 73.64% inhibition. Hence, it was concluded that the ELEO might be a natural source for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, analgesic, inflammatory, and antimicrobial-related diseases. Moreover, additional phytochemical and pharmacological studies are needed to isolate responsible chemical ingredients to formulate new drugs for the examined activities.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-07", "cleaned_text": "of Euphorbia larica Boiss.: A New Report [https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12030662](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12030662) 2nd Edition]( /journal/antioxidants/special_issues/antioxidant_essential_oil_2 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Essential oils (EOs) produced from plants have multiple pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties including microbial resistance [ [1](#B1-antioxidants-12-00662), [2](#B2-antioxidants-12-00662), [3](#B3-antioxidants-12-00662)], scavenging pain [ [10](#B10-antioxidants-12-00662)]. In recent eras, the EOs obtained from medicinal herbs have gained attention due to their diverse biomedical applications including antidiabetic, antifungal, antibacterial, and pharmacological capabilities, as well as effective natural remedies [ [7](#B7-antioxidants-12-00662), [8](#B8-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Furthermore, essential oils are widely utilized over the globe with less adverse effects, easy availability, affordability, and a high rate of efficacy [ [11](#B11-antioxidants-12-00662), [12](#B12-antioxidants-12-00662)], which have attracted considerable interest [ [13](#B13-antioxidants-12-00662)]. [14](#B14-antioxidants-12-00662)]. According to recent statistics (2020), cancer has been ranked second most common among the main causes of mortality over the globe, and around 9.6 million people died from cancer in 2018 [ [15](#B15-antioxidants-12-00662)]. The exploration of new medications using therapeutic plants that can heal cancer has become one of the most exhilarating demands through phytochemical screening [ [16](#B16-antioxidants-12-00662)]. However, medicinal plants have offered a significant role in developing traditional medicine systems, particularly to treat cancer [ [17](#B17-antioxidants-12-00662)]. In addition, EO constituents have also played an important role in cancer prevention and treatment [ [13](#B13-antioxidants-12-00662)]. In recent decades, most of the plants bearing essential oil displayed anticancer [ [13](#B13-antioxidants-12-00662), [14](#B14-antioxidants-12-00662), [18](#B18-antioxidants-12-00662)] and antitumor [ [19](#B19-antioxidants-12-00662)] activities to overcome the expansion of multidrug resistance complications [ [20](#B20-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Because of the considerable capabilities of the essential oils in cytotoxic treatment, the ELEO could be used as a complementary therapy to natural and chemotherapeutic drugs [ [21](#B21-antioxidants-12-00662)]. [22](#B22-antioxidants-12-00662)]. There are 16 different CA isozymes [ [23](#B23-antioxidants-12-00662)], and CAs play a vigorous role in mammals in several processes such as pH control, ion transport, calcification, stability, and secretion of electrolytes [ [22](#B22-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Classical CA (acetazolamide and brinzolamide) inhibitors have been used as commercial medications in the healing of numerous ailments comprising edema, cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy, obesity, and osteoporosis [ [24](#B24-antioxidants-12-00662)] for a long time with undesired side effects [ [25](#B25-antioxidants-12-00662), [26](#B26-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Thus, searching for new natural and safer CA inhibitors with fewer side effects is required. [27](#B27-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Type I diabetes (T1DM) is typically instigated by the deficiency of insulin secretion. In contrast, type II diabetes (T2DM) is instigated by increased insulin resistance in the liver, decreased cell mass of peripheral organs, and insufficient insulin production [ [28](#B28-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Approximately 90% of diabetic people have T2DM [ [29](#B29-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Furthermore, -glucosidase (AGIs) inhibitors are efficient and perform a substantial role in reducing post-prandial glucose levels. The -Glucosidase enzyme (EC 3.2.1.20) catalyzes the release of -glucosides from the non-reducing side of the carbohydrates, consequently inhibiting the enzyme to control the raised glucose levels in the human blood [ [30](#B30-antioxidants-12-00662)]. -Glucosidase (AGIs) inhibitors are effective and play a significant role in reducing post-prandial glucose levels. Numerous side effects, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain, are due to the regular use of synthetic drugs [ [17](#B17-antioxidants-12-00662), [18](#B18-antioxidants-12-00662), [19](#B19-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Hence, developing new natural AGIs with high efficiency is highly essential without imposing greater side effects. [31](#B31-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Some plant species of Euphorbia have been documented for various health complications such as skin diseases, migraine, gonorrhea, intestinal parasites, and warts [ [32](#B32-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Euphorbia larica Boiss (Local name = Isbaq) is a significant native medicinal plant, mostly distributed over stony and rocky (up to one-meter-high) places of Dhofar (Salalah) and Ad Dakhiliyah areas of Oman. The native individuals of Oman habitually use sap or latex of E. larica to patch bites, burn wounds [ [33](#B33-antioxidants-12-00662)], as well as for treating camels with parasites [ [34](#B34-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Quercetin and kaempferol were extracts of E. larica leaf [ [35](#B35-antioxidants-12-00662)]. In addition, saturated and oxygenated hydrocarbons and esters were identified and isolated from the aerial parts of E. larica [ [36](#B36-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Recently, an anthracene derivative (eupholaricanone) with -glucosidase inhibition along with three steroids was reported from aerial parts of E. larica [ [28](#B28-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Hence, to highlight the significance of the plant essential oil under study, for the first time GC-MS profiling, -glucosidase inhibition, and antioxidant, antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and breast cancer activities are available in the literature. Therefore, our main aim was to examine and evaluate the chemical arrangement and biological capabilities of ELEO as a first step in evaluating the prospective benefits of the plant species. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plant Material and Identification 2.2. Extraction of EO [7](#B7-antioxidants-12-00662), [37](#B37-antioxidants-12-00662)]. ELEO was obtained from the burette, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), then weighed and preserved in the fridge at 4 \u00b0C until GC/MS profiling and biological screening. 2.3. GC/MS Profiling of the ELEO 2.4. Identification of Compounds 2.5. In Vitro Cytotoxic Capacity [38](#B38-antioxidants-12-00662)]. This study used the human breast normal cell line (MCF-10A) as a control. The MDA-MB-231 cell lines were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and MCF-10A was purchased from the Iranian Biological Resource Center (IBRC) (Tehran, Iran). Cells were uniformly cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) and further augmented together with 1% antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin) and around 10% FBS. The cells were equally injected in a 96-well plate at 1.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well density and then incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. The medium was discarded, and both the cell lines were tested using ELEO at dosages of 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 g/mL, respectively [ [39](#B39-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Right after 48 h of the incubation [ [17](#B17-antioxidants-12-00662)], around 20 L MTT solution, 5 mg/mL, was inoculated into every well and incubated for a further 4 h. However, the medium was then discarded, and the formazan precipitate was carefully homogenized the mixture's were examined via a microplate reader at 570 nm. All tests were carried out in triplicate, and the cytotoxicity potential was represented as a % of cell viability equated to untreated control cells following Equation (1) [ [39](#B39-antioxidants-12-00662)]. 2.6. In Vitro -Glucosidase Potential [7](#B7-antioxidants-12-00662), [30](#B30-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Furthermore, high to low dosages of the ELEO (60, 30, 15, 7.8, 3.90, and 1.95 \u00b5g/mL) were incubated through the -glucosidase enzyme (2 U/2 mL) in phosphate buffer for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. Later on, after the addition of 25 \u00b5L of substrate (p-nitrophenyl-a-D-glucopyranoside, 0.7 mM, final), the variations in absorbance at 400 nm for 30 min were noted using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). DMSO-d (7.5 percent final) was applied as a positive control. In the current screening, acarbose with an IC50 377.7 1.34 \u00b5g/mL was applied as a standard. The results were obtained by estimating IC50 through EZ-fit software via Equations (1) and (2). 2.7. In Vitro Carbonic Anhydrase-II Bioassay [40](#B40-antioxidants-12-00662)]. To proceed with the assay, a freshly arranged aqueous solution of 20 bovine erythrocyte CA-II (0.1 mg/mL); 20 mL 4-Nitrophenyl acetate (4-NPA, 0.7 mM) in ethanol; and buffer solution (140 mL) HEPES-trisTris-HCl (20 mM) with pH 7.4 were properly homogenized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 10%) enzyme (EC 4.2.1.1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were carefully incubated for 15 min using a 96-well plate. Furthermore, the reaction proceeded by adding 20 L 4-NPA and examining the rate of product formation for 30 min accurately with intervals of 1 min at 25 \u00b0C via a microplate reader. The significance was estimated through % inhibition using Equation (1). 2.8. Antimicrobial Assessment [41](#B41-antioxidants-12-00662)]. The microbial strains (clinical isolates) were identified by Dr. Hazir Rahman, Department of Microbiology, AWKUM, Mardan. 2.8.1. Antibacterial Screening [41](#B41-antioxidants-12-00662), [42](#B42-antioxidants-12-00662)]. For the antibacterial valuation, the media were arranged by adding 28 g of nutrient agar (NA) media along with 1 L of distilled water (DW) and shaken until the media was entirely homogenized. All the required apparatus was sterilized including prepared media, well borer, Petri plates, and wire loop, properly autoclaved at 121 for 15 min. Then, around 20 mL of nutrient agar autoclaved media was loaded into every Petri plate using a laminar flow hood and kept undisturbed until their solidification. The tested bacterial strains were carefully inoculated following safety measures using a wire loop at a concentration of bacterial cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL. Five wells of equal magnitude (3 mm) and the same distance were made over the solidified media using a sterilized corn borer. 2.8.2. Antifungal Evaluation [41](#B41-antioxidants-12-00662), [42](#B42-antioxidants-12-00662)]. The antifungal activity was carried out by adding 39 g of the potato dextrose agar (PDA) to 1 L of distilled water in a glass conical flask and shaken until homogenized. Then, the antifungal media (PDA), Petri dishes, wire loop, and 3 mm steel borer were carefully autoclaved at 121 \u00b0C for around 20 min. The PDA media at about 20 mL was loaded into every glass Petri dish and afterward placed until media solidification. The tested fungal inoculum at a dosage of 108-109 CFU/mL was uniformly spread on the congealed PDA media. Later, around five wells using a borer of 3 mm were made at equal distances from one another. Low to high doses of ELEO were carefully inoculated into the 1st and 2nd wells over the media, and the standard fluconazole at the same doses was injected into the 3rd and 4th wells. At the same time, the 5th well was filled with DMSO, which was employed as a negative control. Next, all the Petri plates were carefully packed, labeled, and incubated for 72 h at 25 \u00b0C. Lastly, the Petri plates were brought out and the zone of inhibition was examined around the wells in millimeters. All of the data were taken in triplicate and expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. 3 mg DPPH with 100 mL of distilled methanol (DM). Then, the reagent was kept in the shade for around 30 min to produce the free radicals to appraise the antioxidant potential of the ELEO. The ELEO and ascorbic acid were prepared at dosages of 1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 \u00b5g/mL to screen their antioxidant effects. Moreover, around 2 mL of ELEO and standard was added to 2 mL of the previously organized DPPH stock solution and employed for incubation in the shade for 25 min. Eventually, the absorbance of the used samples was noted at 517 nm utilizing UV/Vis spectrophotometry (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The results were obtained via Equation (3). 2.9.2. ABTS Test 2.10. In Vivo Activities 2.10.1. Analgesic Assessment [41](#B41-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Furthermore, the experimental animals were equally divided into 5 groups (n = 6). The tested samples, including E. larica EO, control, and standard, were inoculated very carefully through the intraperitoneal muscle in experimental animals using the sterilized syringe. Around 1 mL of (0.7%) acetic acid (AA) at dosages of 5 mL/kg body weight (BW) were infused into all the groups of the Swiss albino mice. Then, after 45 min, the mice of group 1 (control) and group 2 (standard) were given around 1 mL each of normal saline and aspirin, correspondingly, injected following ARRIVE guidelines. In addition to that, the ELEO was inoculated to the remaining groups of 3rd, 4th, and 5th experimental animals at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg BW dosages, respectively. Furthermore, writhes were calculated to determine the tested samples' analgesic potential compared to normal saline and analgesic standard for 10 min. The obtained data were represented by % inhibition via Equation (4). 2.10.2. Anti-Inflammatory Evaluation [41](#B41-antioxidants-12-00662)]. The Swiss albino mice were properly grouped, as previously stated in the analgesic bioassay. However, inflammation was produced in all the groups of the Swiss albino mice by injecting 1 mL (1%) of carrageenan [ [44](#B44-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Right after 30 min, the Swiss albino mice of group 1 were treated with 1 mL of normal saline (NS) as a negative control, whereas 1 mL of diclofenac sodium (50 mg/kg) was inoculated into group 2 mice following safety measure. The essential oil of EL at dosages of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg of body weight (BW) were inoculated into the experimental animals of groups 3, 4, and 5, individually. In addition to that, the anti-inflammatory capabilities of examined samples were determined by calculating the Swiss albino mice right paw diameter in the same way as after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd h, respectively, and resulting data were represented as % inhibition and computed applying Formula (4). 3. Statistical Analysis 4. Result and Discussion 4.1. Chemical Composition Identification of the ELEO [Table 1](#antioxidants-12-00662-t001)). Camphene (16.41%) and hydroxy-acids such as 2-methyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,1-(2-hydroxy)-1-propanoic acid and 2-methyl-1,3-hydroxy-2,4,4-trimethylene propanoic acid were identified previously in the wax of E. larica [ [36](#B36-antioxidants-12-00662)]. These outcomes agree with those described in previous analyses [ [45](#B45-antioxidants-12-00662), [46](#B46-antioxidants-12-00662), [47](#B47-antioxidants-12-00662)]. The EOs of E. caracasana and E. cotinifolia harvested from M\u00e9rida, Venezuela, were found to be oxide (8.61%), and -selinene (4.21%) was determined in the E. fischeriana essential oil from China [ [46](#B46-antioxidants-12-00662)]. On the other hand, small quantities in the EO of E. mauritanica belonging to Egypt [ [47](#B47-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Moreover, the EO of E. mauritanica was found to be higher in A (18.66%), verticiol (17.05%), and limonene (7.91%) [ [47](#B47-antioxidants-12-00662)] to our results. As Lokar et al. [ [48](#B48-antioxidants-12-00662)] reported, different habitats, seasons, geographical areas, and harvesting periods can affect the quantitative composition and variation of EO in similar plant species from diverse regions. The difference in the quantity of the active ingredients implies the variation in the ecosystem diversity where plant species grow. According to Salehi et al. [ [49](#B49-antioxidants-12-00662)], the EOs obtained from the plant species belonging to the genus Euphorbia consist of sesquiterpenes as a leading bioactive constituent in both oxygenated and non-oxygenated forms; however, -caryophyllene was observed as the prime component up to 7% in the EOs of the genus Euphorbia [ [49](#B49-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Furthermore, our results displayed a higher quantity of camphene and thunbergol, utilized as a distinctive indicator of E. larica from the southern areas of Oman. 4.2. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Potential [13](#B13-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Loizzo et al. [ [50](#B50-antioxidants-12-00662)] about the cytotoxic capabilities of plant essential oils. At the same time, human normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A was kept as a control in the experiment. The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] bioassay was applied to evaluate the decrease in cancer cell viability persuaded through cytotoxic agents. For MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A, the IC50, % inhibition, and % viability of ELEO are shown in [Table 2](#antioxidants-12-00662-t002). The results of the MTT assay revealed that the ELEO was effective against an IC50 =183.8 Maraveas of Croton micans and Croton matourensis having cytotoxic potential. Thus, our findings favor the data reported by Azaat et al. [ [54](#B54-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Yagi et al. [ [55](#B55-antioxidants-12-00662)] for the essential oils extracted from the genus Euphorbia. The similarities observed in the mentioned literature with current data might be due to the essential oils extracted from the same genus and also the same approach used to examine the cytotoxic effects. However, our observed findings are not equated with the results presented by Estanislao et al. [ [56](#B56-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Lahmadi et al. [ [57](#B57-antioxidants-12-00662)] for Eucalyptus and Decatropis bicolor, respectively. The variation among the effects might be due to the differences in the plant genus and habitat, and the bioactive content in the plants also varies due to the quality and water availability, as reflected in the literature stated by Rawat et al. [ [58](#B58-antioxidants-12-00662)]. 4.3. -Glucosidase and Jelassi et al. [ [61](#B61-antioxidants-12-00662)]. However, essential oils are affluent sources of monomers that have promising capabilities to act as antidiabetics, as reflected by Bigham et al. [ [62](#B62-antioxidants-12-00662)] in plant species Teucrium polium and Musca domestica and also revealed by Riyaphan et al. [ [63](#B63-antioxidants-12-00662)]. [64](#B64-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Yu et al. [ [65](#B65-antioxidants-12-00662)] for the antidiabetic potential of some plant species of the genus Euphorbia. However, our data are not matched with the data presented by Salazar et al. [ [66](#B66-antioxidants-12-00662)] for Origanum vulgare and Dang et al. [ [67](#B67-antioxidants-12-00662)] for some Vietnamese citrus peel essential oils. The resemblances may perhaps be due to the genus similarities and disparities might be due to the differences in the plant family, as well as habitat, as these factors alter the chemical composition of the constituents within the plants. Furthermore, the same sample (ELEO) was investigated against the CA-II enzyme, displaying above 50% inhibition, and was found to be active against CA-II with IC50 = 162.82 \u00b1 0.27 \u00b5g/mL). These findings revealed that ELEO might be utilized as a therapeutic method for type 2 diabetes and other diseases associated with the CA-II enzyme. 4.4. Antimicrobial Potential 4.4.1. Antibacterial Significance [68](#B68-antioxidants-12-00662)]. E. larica essential oil presented considerable activity against the tested microbes. However, the EO was found effective against the Gram-positive tested bacteria and offered 19.8 \u00b1 0.02 mm resistance against B. atrophaeus followed by B. subtilis with ZOI 18.2 \u00b1 0.04 mm, as equated to the Gram-negative bacterial strain S. typhi having 15.4 \u00b1 0.02 mm ZOI. At the same time, 15.3 \u00b1 0.07 mm ZOI was observed against K. pneumonia ( [Figure 3](#antioxidants-12-00662-f003)). In addition to that, the standard used for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains erythromycin and levofloxacin offered significant antibacterial resistance. The antibacterial feature attributed to the essential oils is due to the presence of -selinene, as earlier reported by Silva et al. [ [69](#B69-antioxidants-12-00662)] in Myrcia alagoensis. The plant effluents in eremophilene and caryophyllene were also reported for their antibacterial capabilities, as revealed in the literature published by Utegenova et al. [ [70](#B70-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Moo et al. [ [71](#B71-antioxidants-12-00662)], which were also examined in the plant under study. In addition to that, essential oils also contain monomers that have antibacterial capabilities, as stated by Su et al. [ [72](#B72-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Elegir et al. [ [73](#B73-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Moreover, our outcomes agreed with the records expressed by Zhu et al. [ [74](#B74-antioxidants-12-00662)], Adedoyin et al. [ [75](#B75-antioxidants-12-00662)], and heterophylla, and Euphorbia hirta, as these plant species belong to the same genus and most of the chemical constituents are the same. In addition, the recent data do not match the data revealed by Carovic et al. [ [77](#B77-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Wilkinson et al. [ [78](#B78-antioxidants-12-00662)], as the plant species contain different phytoconstituents due to habitat variability, edaphic and climatic factors, as well as the quality and availability of water. 4.4.2. Antifungal Capabilities [79](#B79-antioxidants-12-00662)]. To further validate the previous literature as described by Hu et al. [ [80](#B80-antioxidants-12-00662)], the plant essential oil under study was examined for its antifungal significance and presented an appreciable resistance against the tested fungal strains. However, the maximum ZOI was observed against Aspergillus parasiticus at 18.03 \u00b1 0.01 followed by Aspergillus niger with 17.4 \u00b1 0.03 ZOI as compared to the used antifungal standard; however, the negative control was examined as inactive ( [Figure 4](#antioxidants-12-00662-f004)). The significant resistance against the fungal strains is attributed to the presence of -eudesmol, as earlier reported by Ho et al. [ [81](#B81-antioxidants-12-00662)], and camphene and thunbergol, as previously documented by Angioni et al. [ [82](#B82-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Mitic et al. [ [83](#B83-antioxidants-12-00662)], respectively. The role of monomers acting as an antifungal agents cannot be denied, which was earlier documented by Chen et al. [ [84](#B84-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Neves et al. [ [85](#B85-antioxidants-12-00662)]. [86](#B86-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Mahmoud et al. [ [87](#B87-antioxidants-12-00662)], however, our results deviate from those as stated by Bansod et al. [ [88](#B88-antioxidants-12-00662)], and Oumzil et al. [ [89](#B89-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Different plant species vary in their chemical constituents, which can overcome various human health complications, as well as that the environmental gradients influence the bioactive constituents within a plant species, as earlier stated by Shah et al. [ [90](#B90-antioxidants-12-00662)]. 4.5. Antioxidant Capability [91](#B91-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Shah et al. [ [41](#B41-antioxidants-12-00662)]. To confirm this further, the essential oils obtained from the whole plant of E. larica Boiss. (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated for their free radical scavenging capacities. The assessment revealed that the analyzed samples had considerable potential to scavenge the free radicals ( [Figure 5](#antioxidants-12-00662-f005)). However, E. larica essential oil was observed with utmost significance via DPPH assay with an IC50 = 133.53 \u00b1 0.19 an IC50 = 154.93 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5g/mL. In addition to that, the standard ascorbic acid offered an IC50 = 73.72 \u00b1 0.24 and DPPH and ABTS assay, respectively. The appreciable ability attributed to ELEO is due to the presence of -selinene, eremophilene, and caryophyllene in a high amounts, which was heretofore explained by Chandra et al. [ [92](#B92-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Ahmadvand et al. [ in Callicarpa macrophylla and Artemisia persica, respectively. However, monomers also can neutralize free radicals, as documented previously by Maraveas et al. [ [52](#B52-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Su et al. [ [72](#B72-antioxidants-12-00662)]. [94](#B94-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Essa et al. [ [47](#B47-antioxidants-12-00662)] for the essential oils of E. heterophylla and E. mauritanica L., as the plant species under study belongs to the same genus, having the majority of common bioactive constituents which can neutralize the free radicals. However, our data did not match with the study documented by Jie et al. [ [46](#B46-antioxidants-12-00662)], and the plant studied, Euphorbia fischeriana, belongs to the same genus collected from China. The chemical ingredients vary among the plants of the same genus due to their habitat, quality, and availability of water. In addition to that, plant species from a different genus, Ochradenus, presented similar antioxidant potential due to the same method of essential oil extraction, habitat, and a similar approach used to examine the free radical scavenging effect, as revealed in the literature of Ullah et al. [ [37](#B37-antioxidants-12-00662)]. 4.6. Anti-Inflammatory Significance [Table 3](#antioxidants-12-00662-t003)). At the same time, the normal saline was observed to be inactive ( [Table 4](#antioxidants-12-00662-t004)). Our current findings authenticate the data confirmed by Miguel et al. [ [4](#B4-antioxidants-12-00662)] for EOs. The anti-inflammatory significance depicted by the plant essential oils, mainly caryophyllene oxide, were previously reported by Chao et al. [ [95](#B95-antioxidants-12-00662)] in Cinnamomum osmophloeum and -caryophyllene and observed in the essential oils of Syzygium cumini and Psidium guajava, having promising anti-inflammatory activity, as stated by Siani et al. [ [96](#B96-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Furthermore, our study is supported by the details mentioned in the data explained by Sinan et al. [ [97](#B97-antioxidants-12-00662)] and De-Morais et al. [ [98](#B98-antioxidants-12-00662)] in the genus Euphorbia. The similarities in the aforementioned plants were due to the plant species from the same genus because of the common bioactive constituents and the extraction method of essential oils. Moreover, our current data do not match with the literature documented by Adeosun et al. [ [99](#B99-antioxidants-12-00662)], Souza et al. [ [100](#B100-antioxidants-12-00662)], and Aboluwodi et al. [ [101](#B101-antioxidants-12-00662)]. The variations observed might be due to the plant belonging to a different genus, environmental factors, collection time, and quality and availability of water, as well that the pollutants in the water contents also have adverse effects on the bioactive constituents, as explained by Shah et al. [ [102](#B102-antioxidants-12-00662)]. 4.7. Analgesic Capabilities [103](#B103-antioxidants-12-00662)]. To confirm the previous study, the essential oils of E. larica were examined to emphasize the capabilities to relieve pain induced in Swiss albino mice via acetic acid. The screening revealed that the E. larica essential oil presented significant potential of 36.95, 48.18, and 58.33% reduction in writhes caused by the acetic acid in the Swiss albino mice from low to high doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, correspondingly ( [Table 4](#antioxidants-12-00662-t004)). However, the normal saline was observed to be inactive, and the analgesic standard (aspirin) depicted 68.47% inhibition. The analgesic significance ascribed to the plant essential oil under study is due to the presence of limonene, as previously expressed by Guimaraes et al. [ [104](#B104-antioxidants-12-00662)], and caryophyllene, as elaborated by Bakir et al. [ [105](#B105-antioxidants-12-00662)]. Thus, our results consented with the data earlier reported by Ahmad et al. [ [106](#B106-antioxidants-12-00662)] and Majid et al. [ [107](#B107-antioxidants-12-00662)] for Euphorbia decipiens and Euphorbia dracunculoides, respectively. The similarities in our results were observed because the plant under investigation belonged to the same genus, Euphorbia, and the approach used to examine the analgesic activity was also the same. In addition to that, our recent results did not agree with the data presented by Kaskoos et al. [ [108](#B108-antioxidants-12-00662)] for Lippia citriodora and Citrus limon or the data reported in the literature stated for Cyperus rotundus by Chen et al. [ [109](#B109-antioxidants-12-00662)]. The variation in the data of our findings with the previously documented literature is due to the variation among the plant species, as well as that the different plant species possess various active constituents which are influenced by various aspects, such as habitat, climatic and edaphic factors, and water availability, as stated by Aboukhalid et al. [ [110](#B110-antioxidants-12-00662)]. 5.
