The Samuel Merritt University (SMU) Sponsored Health Insurance Plan is a Preferred Provider Plan (PPO) underwritten by Anthem Blue Cross. The plan has been designed specifically for SMU students and their dependents (spouse, domestic partner, and/or children) with an emphasis on wellness. The plan is designed to provide full coverage for medical care including annual routine physicals, well child care and immunizations. Samuel Merritt University requires all students to obtain and maintain continuous coverage in a domestic medical insurance plan that is compliant with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The minimum level of coverage for waiving enrollment in the student health insurance plan includes an ACA-compliant level medical plan, urgent and non-urgent care, mental health benefits, and prescription coverage. Each student is required to maintain continuous medical health insurance coverage until they are no longer an active student, i.e. graduate, withdraw, etc. The SMU student health plan offers two options, Enhanced and Basic. Both plans offer a full comprehensive plan of benefits but the Enhanced plan will provide coverage with a lower annual deductible, lower out-of-pocket maximum, coinsurance and copays. If enrolling in the Basic plan you will have access to the same benefits as the Enhanced plan but with a higher annual deductible, higher out-of-pocket maximum, coinsurance and copays. Coverage is available for dependents too If you are covered by Anthem Student Advantage through Samuel Merritt University, you may enroll your lawful spouse, domestic partner or dependent children under the age of 26. Here is how it works: Students must enroll their dependents for coverage within 30 days of their initial eligibility.As your new school year begins, it's important to understand your health care benefits and how they work. Your Anthem Student Advantage plan will help guide you through that process with information about who is eligible, what is covered, how much it costs, and the best ways to access care.

As we receive additional guidance and clarification on the new health care reform laws from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor and Internal Revenue Service, we may be required to make additional changes to this Summary of Benefits. This Summary of Benefits, as updated, is subject to the approval of the California Department of Insurance and the California Department of Managed Health Care (as applicable). In addition to the benefits described in this summary, coverage may include additional benefits, depending upon the member's home state. The benefits provided in this summary are subject to federal and California laws. There are some states that require more generous benefits be provided to their residents, even if the master policy was not issued in their state. If the member's state has such requirements, we will adjust the benefits to meet the requirements. The family deductible and out-of-pocket maximum are embedded meaning the cost shares of one family member will be applied to the individual deductible and individual out-of-pocket maximum; in addition, amounts for all family members apply to the family deductible and family out-of-pocket maximum. No one member will pay more than the individual deductible and individual out-of- pocket maximum. All medical services subject to a coinsurance are also subject to the annual medical deductible. Annual Out-of-Pocket Maximums includes deductible, copays, coinsurance and prescription drug. In network and out of network out of pocket maximum are exclusive of each other. For plans with an office visit copay, the copay applies to the actual office visit and additional cost shares may apply for any other service performed in the office (i.e., X-ray, lab, surgery), after any applicable deductible. Preventive Care Services includes physical exam, preventive screenings (including screenings for cancer, HPV, diabetes, cholesterol, blood pressure, hearing and vision, immunization, health education, intervention services, HIV testing) and additional preventive care for women provided for in the guidance supported by Health Resources and Service Administration. For Medical Emergency care rendered by a Non- Participating Provider or Non-Contracting Hospital, reimbursement is based on the reasonable and customary value. Members may be responsible for any amount in excess of the reasonable and customary value. If your plan includes an emergency room facility copay and you are directly admitted to a hospital, your emergency room facility copay is waived. If your plan includes out of network benefit and you use a non-network provider, you are responsible for any difference between the covered expense and the actual non-participating providers charge. Certain services are subject to the utilization review program. Before scheduling services, the member must make sure utilization review is obtained. If utilization review is not obtained, benefits may be reduced or not paid, according to the plan. Certain types of physicians may not be represented in the PPO network in the state where the member receives services. If such physician is not available in the service area, the member's copay is the same as for PPO (with and without pre-notification, if applicable). Member is responsible for applicable copays, deductibles and charges which exceed covered expense. Additional visits maybe authorized if medically necessary. Pre-service review must be obtained prior to receiving the additional services. If your plan includes out of network benefits, all services with calendar/plan year limits are combined both in and out of network. Transplants covered only when performed at Centers of Medical Excellence or Blue Distinction Centers. Bariatric Surgery covered only when performed at Blue Distinction Center for Specialty Care for Bariatric Surgery. Skilled Nursing Facility day limit does not apply to mental health and substance abuse. Respite Care limited to 5 consecutive days per admission. Freestanding Lab and Radiology Center is defined as services received in a non-hospital based facility. Coordination of Benefits: The benefits of this plan may be reduced if the member has any other group health or dental coverage so that the services received from all group coverage do not exceed 100% of the covered expense.Notes 18 When using non-network pharmacy; members are responsible for in-network pharmacy copay plus 50% of the remaining prescription drug maximum allowed amount & costs in excess of the prescription drug maximum allowed amount. Members will pay upfront and submit a claim form. Supply limits for certain drugs may be different, go to Anthem website or call customer service.
