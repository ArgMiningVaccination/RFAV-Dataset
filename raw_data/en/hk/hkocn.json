What is homeopathic medicine? Homeopathy is the practice of using extremely diluted forms of natural substances that are used to treat a wide variety of ailments. Homeopathic medicine is practiced by alternative healers, or those that practice Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Homeopathic medicine and CAM cover a wide range of potential professionals who specialize in treatments, therapies and disciplines to alleviate specific medical conditions. What is considered alternative medicine today could easily become a mainstream treatment tomorrow as many of these methods undergo testing and clinical trials in the future. When these methods are combined with standard medical procedures, physicians refer to this practice as \"integrative medicine\" ( [American Institute of Homeopathy](https://homeopathyusa.org/homeopathic-medicine.html)). Alternative healers can specialize in myriad disciplines, whether focusing on a full spectrum of care to treat a specific medical condition or alleviating distinct symptoms. Some 40 percent of American adults have used some type of alternative healer to treat a medical condition. "}
