Gary N. Klepper, D.C., N.D. From the Chinese medicine perspective, it is not surprising that therapeutic gemstones have such powerful effects. For me, holistic medicine is vibrational medicine\u2014meaning that any therapeutic substance is effective primarily because of its vibration. I have seen the gemstones produce a very strong vibrational response. Heiner Fruehauf, Ph.D., L.Ac. Chair, Chinese Medicine Department National College of Naturopathic Medicine I have seen remarkable results with therapeutic gemstones, including performance enhancement with professional and Olympic athletes. In order to advance in science, we often try new things to achieve greater results than previously proven. In the future, I have no doubt that further research will confirm the demonstrated clinical efficacy of therapeutic gemstones. Ada Gonzalez, N.D. International Speaker and Educator Gemstone energy medicine has transformed my ability to use natural medicine in profound ways. As more practitioners in many healing disciplines experience the depth and breadth of these therapies, medicine itself will be transformed. Sara Hazel, N.D. Founder, Barefoot Sage Spa I have been working with therapeutic gemstone spheres both personally and professionally for over eight years, and the benefits are spectacular. I feel therapeutic gemstones are the most valuable energy healing tool available. There is no other intervention that is so simple and precise in how it works with the mind-body energy system. I am grateful every day that this resource is available to me, my family, and my clients. Carol Tuttle,MRET Author of Remembering Wholeness In my healthcare practice I have found that the effects of gemstones are truly powerful. Clinical treatment with gemstones often results in profound and lasting improvements in my clients' physical and inner health, changes that clearly manifest in their everyday lives. My experience has borne out the value of these tools over and over again. Alan Coffman, L.Ac. This is indeed the therapy of the future. Therapeutic gemstone spheres have the most powerful therapeutic effect I have ever experienced in my life. LourdesRabago, C.M.I, RPh I continually receive feedback from clients and friends on the beneficial effects of therapeutic gemstones. Their beauty and healing energy register a profound and lasting impression on those who experience them. Linda A. Lile, Ph.D., RCST I use therapeutic gemstones in my work as an acupuncturist, because they address a complete spectrum of issues safely and effectively. There is simply no substitute for the work done by therapeutic gemstones. Blaise Desesa, Ph.D., L.Ac. \"I think the most significant difference I have felt since wearing therapeutic gemstones has been related to my relationship with my wife. We have both noticed that since she has been wearing her Pink Tourmaline and I have been wearing my Green Tourmaline, I am much more attentive and affectionate towards her. The changes are very obvious and include not only a sexual enhancement aspect but the overwhelming desire to simply be in close proximity to my wife. This is a pronounced difference, evident even to some outsiders. \"Many of the other observations reported regarding athletic performance and endurance as a result of the Tourmaline necklace have not been observed by me. However, having been on Trans-D Tropin (a GHRH analog) for over five years, my athletic performance, endurance, and recovery are already well beyond what could be expected. Nevertheless, based on my own personal experience, I can see how Green Tourmaline may help to enhance athletic performance. I use Green Tourmaline and other gems on a regular basis. The bottom lineis that the gemstones do make a difference\u2014although sometimes I have a difficult time believing it myself!

In my personal opinion, energy medicine will certainly be a major constituent of the medicine of the future, although this sentiment is not original. Historically, as far back as 5000 years ago, healers have used various forms of energy in treating the ailments of society. Whether one refers to the use of energy in medicine as in five-dimensional scalar waves or the Far Eastern forms of energy healing using chi, the essense is the same. If one considers using the mathematical formulas Einstein developed, which show that time and space are relative, and we accept the theory of relativity, which essentially states that as we travel at the speed of light, time slows down, then it is no longer a leap to extrapolate the resulting increase in longevity and health if one can generate the appropriate types of energy fields. The subject of using various forms of energy in healing and possibly in prolonging life fascinated me from the start. I first read Vibrational Medicine, by Richard Gerber, M.D., while I was still in medical school and then read The Body Electric, by Robert O. Becker, M.D., as I started my residency in general surgery. The book you now hold, Gemstone Energy Medicine: Healing Body, Mind and Spirit, by Michael Katz, is fascinating and intriguing because it brings within the reach of each individual a method by which he or she can not only learn how to harness but actually generate the appropriate type of energy fields needed or desired by the person or healthcare provider. It allows the means by which to attain this previously difficult and intangible goal and brings it within the reach of the individual. Research indicates that specific fields of energy enhance the immune system, evidenced by increased DNA synthesis in lymphocytes. Already, the evidence exists that trans-membrane potential is substantially increased by using field technology instead of direct electrical induction. Recently, a mobius strip, blind loop induced scalar wave generated by a band worn on the wrist has generated scientific research into the biological effects of this new type of non-Hertzian electromagnetic energy. These findings lend support to the theory of the life-enhancing properties provided by various methods of potentiating energy.\u00b9 The neutralization of many of the harmful electromagnetic frequencies generated in our modern society alone is enough to warrant further research into any device that indicates the ability or potential to protect the biological system. Patients have reported many benefits during and after their experiences of using various forms of energy healing, including having an increased sense of well-being, more energy, better sleep, and improved pain control. Acupuncture, in fact, is nothing more than enhancing and opening up energy channels that have been blocked or, in other cases, blocking certain energy channels along specific meridians to achieve a desired effect. Plants exposed to specific types of energy fields have also been noted to grow faster than they do in other parts of the building that lack the field exposure. Although numerous studies indicate the biological significance of linear, transverse, electromagnetic, and acoustic waves, relatively little is known about the role of nonlinear, non-Hertzian, naturally occuring resonance energy (or what I have coined NOR energy) waves in biological systems. The conclusion has been that certain types of energy are more biologically active than traditional electromagnetic fields. The function of non-Hertzian energy is more than likely to be significant, since quantum mechanical analysis of biological processes has revealed that biological systems are of a nonlinear nature. With the additional possibility of energy being programmable as a result of intention, or conscious thought, theoretically this type of NOR energy effect can be potentiated. Energy can be oriented to create a natural, life-enhancing amor-phogenic resonance energy field that produces a positive biologic effect. I believe the effects reported by individuals wearing therapeutic gemstones, including the Olympic athletes who have reported improvement in athletic performance, may actually be indicative of this amorphogenic NOR energy, which in its rawest form can be seen in scalar waves or mental thoughts. When used in conjunction with intention, or conscious effort, the possibilities increase exponentially and become endless. The overall effect of this NOR energy is to excite the electromagnetic field of any substance, organic or non-organic, and thus allow the substance to morph (as in metamorphosis) into a state that is more like its original, natural, electrical matrix form. As an example of the potential of NOR energy, let's consider Kirlian photography. Kirlian photography is a well-known method of measuring electromagnetic energy fields of objects. Dead tissue has a low or dim pattern, whereas a live biological system has a very bright pattern. It is the energy field of an object that determines the brightness of the pattern disclosed on the Kirlian photograph, with disease producing a lower energy image. Kirlian photographic analysis of inanimate but organic objects exposed to some of these forms of energy has been recorded and noted to show a consistent increase in energy patterns on the images of the substances exposed to these fields of energy. Most people have heard of the phantom pain experienced by patients who have had an extremity amputated. Doctors explain that this phantom pain exists in your head and will often treat it with analgesics and antidepressants. However, when Kirlian photographs are taken of these recently amputated limbs, the amputated extremity is still amazingly visible on the Kirlian photograph. Although the amputated part shows up with a dim pattern and the intact portion of the limb appears brighter, the Kirlian photograph does pick up the resonance frequency generated by the remaining intact cells, resulting in the dim pattern on the photograph of a part of the body that is no longer physically present. I believe that it is the innate NOR energy that is being picked up and recorded by the Kirlian photograph. It is this NOR energy that is characteristic and common to every cell in a particular individual's body\u2014 as unique as the DNA that defines the individual's genetic uniqueness. Therefore, this NOR energy must be a function of the DNA, because the DNA is the only substance that is identical in every cell and unique to each individual. Remember that the DNA from one cell contains the entire blueprint for each individual, with all information necessary to create an identical copy of that individual. It is important to recall from basic, elementary science that the smallest building blocks for all substances, whether organic or non-organic, are made up of atoms. And an atom is a flux of energy defined as a proton and a neutron in the center, with electrons flying around the proton and neutron. If an atom is the smallest building block and is defined as a flux of energy, then everything by definition is a flux of energy, since everything is comprised of atoms. Thus, the DNA also is a flux of energy and has its own NOR frequency, unique to the individual and identical in all the individual's cells. This NOR energy is characteristic of all substances that have their own unique resonance signature, or NOR energy signature. We now understand that the DNA is resonating at the same inherent NOR frequency as all the rest of the cells in the body. And we also recognize that the identical DNA structure existing in each cell continues resonating at its NOR energy regardless of what happens to any other cells or parts of the body, thus allowing for the energy pattern of the collective whole to continue resonating at the specific frequency as when the limb was intact. The amputation of the extremity does not change the NOR energy of the DNA in the rest of the cells in the intact portions of body. In other words, the intact cells resonate and create the energy pattern of the entire body, even though a portion of the body is now gone. But the resonance from the intact cells is sufficient to create the image of the missing extremity viewable on the Kirlian photograph, although it appears lighter or fainter than the rest of the intact body, since the NOR energy of that particular portion of the body no longer exists. Dr. Victor Marcial-Vega, an oncologist and close friend from Florida, has done high resolution blood imaging and dark field microscopy blood tests on patients before and after being exposed to scalar waves generating a form of NOR energy, and he has compared these specimens with previous blood samples from the same patients. According to Dr. Vega, changes, such as a high level of chylomicrons and triglicerides considered abnormal have been cleared by 8o percent or more. Severe fibrin patterns observed by Dr. Vega characteristically in cancer patients, especially those with end-stage metastatic disease, have significantly improved and often are resolved. The blood drawn afterwards showed more debris and waste material than the blood specimens drawn before exposure to these induced NOR energy fields, possibly explaining the detoxification symptoms (headaches, sore throat, achiness, etc.) that most people initially experience. Based on the latest developments in Fractal Mathematics, Chaos Theory andAcausal Physics, these thoughts I have expressed become more and more likely to one day soon leap from the esoteric arena into the field of conservative medicine. Already, there is a peer-reviewed journal, Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine Journal, designed to provide guidelines, scientific background, and scientific credibility for subtle-energy applications, while providing a venue for technical papers involving theory and application of energy in the field of medicine. But due to the resistance of conventional and traditional medicine and the constraints of politics, much of the necessary research to quantify these subtle but essential and accumulative effects of energy medicine will probably not take place for years to come. In the interim, I believe that therapeutic gemstones provide the easiest and most convienient method of increasing and poteniating the naturally occuring resonance energies that are an intricate but virtually ignored part not only of our own bodies, but of every living substance on this planet. This book will provide the reader with the fundamental knowledge and opportunity to learn more about this intriguing field and its application in healing. The information is well written, easy to understand, and organized in a manner that is user friendly. As I have always done with my patients, I encourage and challenge readers to open themselves to the immense possibilities, seek the truth, and evaluate the outcomes for themselves. This book will help you take the first step. Rashid A.

INTRODUCTION Gem Therapy Comes of Age In the years since I first began to work with therapeutic gems and uncover their hidden potential for healing, the field of energy medicine has undergone a transformation. In 1988, when I began my exploration of these powerful healing tools, energy medicine in its various forms was practiced in the West by a few pioneering physicians and enjoyed by a relatively small number of people looking for alternatives to conventional medicine. While the ancient science of acupuncture was taking root in Western medical offices, practices such as homeopathy and Reiki were at the crest of a wave that would soon sweep the West. Since then, a minor revolution has taken place. The paradigm on which energy medicine practices are based has become more widely accepted. This paradigm sees the human being as an integral part of a universe in which, on a fundamental level, matter is a form of energy. In this paradigm, each person is a unique system of interconnected fields of energy and information. Treatments used in energy medicine address this most fundamental level of the human form, affecting the very stuff of which we are made. These treatments target the underlying causes of illness and discontent, rather than merely the symptoms. By using this approach, energy medicine aims not only to improve our health but to transform it. Today this new, energetic model of the human being and human health is not only embraced by large numbers of people, it has excited the interest of many physicians and medical researchers. Doctors and patients are experiencing that energy medicine works\u2014 often where conventional medicine does not. Chronic debilitating illnesses, common ailments, aches, pains, and everything in between have responded to energy medicine practices. Energy medicine is shedding light on the true nature of health and disease and offering solutions to seemingly intractable health problems\u2014often leaving those who practice it healthier and more vital than they thought possible. One of the most powerful forms of energy medicine is gem therapy. Here, too, a change has taken place. Once relegated to the fringes of the healing arts, the therapeutic uses of gems were not widely adopted by either doctors or the public. Offering neither a coherent model of the human being's energetic nature nor precise therapy protocols and tools, gem therapy practices were inconsistent at best and ineffective at worst. Today, all that has changed. Pioneering information and effective new practices are allowing gem therapy to take its rightful place as a cornerstone of energy medicine. In 1988, I began a serious exploration of the application of therapeutic gems for healing. Through a series of illuminating intuitive experiences, I was introduced to extraordinary new information about the uses of gems for enhancing health on all levels. Since then, this information has been confirmed and expanded through further exploration, research, and testing. From these experiences emerged a deeper understanding of our energetic physiology, with profound implications for human health. From them also emerged new ways to evaluate, refine, and shape the gems themselves into reliable and potent therapeutic tools. Equally important, I learned techniques for using gems that are precise, systematic, and effective\u2014techniques that lift gem therapy out of the realm of intuition, hunches, and folklore to a new form of energy medicine\u2014gemstone energy medicine. This book presents an introduction to these discoveries and to the practical ways anyone can use therapeutic gems to enhance health and improve the experience of life. Since I first published my early explorations, thousands of people around the world\u2014physicians, homemakers, Olympic athletes, business people, celebrities, and many others\u2014have come to experience remarkable healing by applying therapeutic gems with these new methods. Confirmed during over a decade of clinical experience, these discoveries have yielded gem therapies that work\u2014both as primary treatments and as complements to other healing modalities. Emotional maladies, mental complaints, and acute and chronic illnesses of all kinds have responded to these gem therapies in unprecedented and exciting ways. How can therapeutic gems accomplish all this? Physicists tell us that all matter is energy in physical form. Gemstones are certainly no exception. Formed over eons, often at high pressure, the Earths gemstones embody intense concentrations of energy. The energetic and physical properties of gemstones are already employed in many aspects of technology. The ability of crystals to conduct and transform energy is no longer a new idea to us. For example, every television, quartz clock, portable phone, and personal computer runs smoothly thanks to Quartz crystals. Today the energetic properties of gems are also being used to improve people's health at a fundamental level. Efforts to use gems for healing have a long history. In many lands and in many ways, people have sought to uncover the abilities that lay hidden within the intensely compressed crystalline structures of gemstones\u2014particularly the ability to heal. Over the centuries, our attempts have met with varying degrees of success and failure. Yet, when using gems for health, something was always missing\u2014for, until recently, we have been unable to discover a systematic way to unlock the full therapeutic powers of gems and to achieve consistent, long-lasting results. To discover why success with gems for healing was elusive for so long, one place to look is to the gems themselves. Essential to the success of any form of medicine is the nature of its therapeutic tools. To be most effective and reliable, medicine must be pure and high in quality. The purity and quality requirements of the gems we use for healing parallel those of any other form of medicine. Meeting these strict requirements can make or break a gem's therapeutic worth. For gemstone energy medicine to be effective and consistent, the use of only therapeutic-quality gemstones is required. The past sixteen years have also shown that a gem's shape profoundly affects the way it can express its energy\u2014and thus its ability to deliver its healing properties. The ideal shape for a therapeutic gem is the sphere. The spherical shape unleashes a gem's potential to reach and heal the deepest energetic aspects of our being, where the root causes of disease and distress lie. Therapeutic gemstone spheres radiate an incomparable energy that can affect all our dimensions, physical and subtle, and hence heal and transform our entire being. Together, these two concepts\u2014the selection of only the highest quality gems and the use of gems cut into the proper shape\u2014represent a simple, yet seismic, shift in the understanding of how gems can work therapeutically. Proper selection, shaping, and use of gemstones transform them into therapeutic power tools. The potent healing energy of therapeutic gems can deeply heal and nourish every aspect of the human form. Fortunately, enjoying the health benefits of gemstone spheres is exceptionally easy and straightforward. Based on this new information, over IOO therapy protocols using gem spheres have been developed. However, powerful benefits can be obtained simply by wearing therapeutic gems around the neck. Wearing a therapeutic gemstone necklace allows the gems' healing energy to penetrate the deepest levels of the wearer's physical and energetic dimensions. There, the gems' energy goes to work dissolving energetic blockages and producing beneficial changes in body, mind, and emotions. The experiences of thousands of people have shown that the information presented in these pages represents a quiet but growing revolution in the healing arts. These remarkable, documented experiences of healing provide our first glimpses of what becomes possible when we put this new form of energy medicine into practice. More empirical research and testing are on their way. In the meantime, preliminary clinical trials and the "}
