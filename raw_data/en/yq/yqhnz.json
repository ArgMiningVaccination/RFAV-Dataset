Set the Mood with Aromatherapy Oils The most popular use for our essential oils derived from 100% natural plant sources is aromatherapy. For those who are unfamiliar with aromatherapy, it is the practice of diffusing drops of essential oil into the air (with the help of a diffuser) and enjoying the resulting \"therapeutic\" mood-enhancing feeling that comes from each oil's fragrant compounds. When the aroma from the oil is inhaled, it travels through your limbic system, which is responsible for controlling breathing, blood pressure and heart rate. Aromas can also trigger memories and subconscious emotions, which can lead to mood-enhancing moments. Bright and Energetic or Calm and Relaxing Aromas Brighten your mood anytime with stimulating natural essence oil choices such as those in the citrus, eucalyptus and uplifting floral categories.

Essential oils such as lavender, bergamot and ylang-ylang fall into this category. When you've had a stressful day, any of these oils can help reduce stress.
