The numerous gaps concerning the knowledge of its mechanism make improving clinical management difficult. As omics technologies allow more comprehensive insight into biology and disease at a molecular level, bioinformatics encompasses valuable tools for studying systems biology, as well as combining and modeling multi-omics data and networks. Network medicine is a subarea of network biology where disease traits are considered perturbations within the interactome. With this approach, potential disease drivers can be revealed, and the effect of drugs, novel or repurposed, used alone or in combination, may be studied. Thus, this work aims to review AF pathology from a network medicine perspective, helping researchers to comprehend the disease more deeply. Essential concepts involved in network medicine are highlighted, and specific research applying network medicine to study AF is discussed. Additionally, data integration through literature mining and bioinformatics tools, with network building, is exemplified. Together, all of the data show the substantial role of structural remodeling, the immune system, and inflammation in this disease etiology. Despite this, there are still gaps to be filled about AF.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-10", "cleaned_text": "Reviewing Atrial Fibrillation Pathophysiology from a Network Medicine Perspective: The Relevance of Structural Remodeling, Inflammation, and the Immune System [https://doi.org/10.3390/life13061364](https://doi.org/10.3390/life13061364) [Mechanisms is related to a significant financial burden to patients and the healthcare system, as patients with AF are 30% more likely to be hospitalized at least once per year [ [5](#B5-life-13-01364)]. This condition is also associated with reduced quality of life and a high risk for dementia, embolic stroke, and elevated mortality, contributing to an increased chance of sudden death. AF raises both men's and women's mortality, with a 1.5- and 1.9-fold increase in the odds ratio, respectively [ [6](#B6-life-13-01364), [7](#B7-life-13-01364), [8](#B8-life-13-01364)]. [9](#B9-life-13-01364), [10](#B10-life-13-01364)]. An improved understanding of AF mechanisms would enable the development of better clinical management. [11](#B11-life-13-01364)]. With sinus rhythm stabilization, b-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and cardiac glycosides can control heart function. However, it is essential to highlight that the side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs limit rhythm control, such as life-threatening arrhythmia. Anticoagulants with or without left atrial appendage closure prevent thromboembolism, carrying bleeding, and procedure risks [ [12](#B12-life-13-01364), [13](#B13-life-13-01364)]. According to the network meta-analysis developed by Wang, Tingting Fang, and Zeyi Cheng (2022) [ [8](#B8-life-13-01364)], non-pharmaceutical therapies were superior to traditional pharmacotherapies in efficacy, reducing arrhythmia recurrence/re-hospitalization, and safety, diminishing ischemic cerebral vascular and cardiovascular mortality. [2](#B2-life-13-01364), [14](#B14-life-13-01364), [15](#B15-life-13-01364), [16](#B16-life-13-01364)]. Generally, a single or limited number of molecular mediators are linked to a disease phenotype. The approach 'one disease-one target-one drug' is reductionist, giving limited view/results on complex human conditions [ [17](#B17-life-13-01364)]. [18](#B18-life-13-01364)]. The complete set of molecular interactions within a cell (gene-gene, gene-protein, protein-protein, and others) is known as the interactome, characterizes systems biology [ [19](#B19-life-13-01364), [20](#B20-life-13-01364)]. [17](#B17-life-13-01364), [21](#B21-life-13-01364), [17](#B17-life-13-01364), [22](#B22-life-13-01364)]. The term 'network pharmacology' can be alternatively applied when the study focuses on pharmacological treatment [ [20](#B20-life-13-01364)]. 1.2. network medicine on the health-disease process. This knowledge gives excellent opportunities for rational drug development and repurposing. 2. Materials and Methods [26](#B26-life-13-01364), [27](#B27-life-13-01364)]. After selecting the top 30 biological entities cited in at least five articles, the related information about them was obtained by consulting the Uniprot database [ [28](#B28-life-13-01364)]. Enrichment analysis and network construction were also performed using OnTheFly version 2.0. Regarding the enrichment analysis of the top 30 biological entities, the Gene Ontology (GO) database in OnTheFly version 2.0 gives information about gene products from all organisms. A biological process involves a particular set of molecular processes conducted by specific gene products. GO terms typically describe functions of gene datasets subjected to statistical tests for enrichment for various functional categories. Gene datasets can indicate that a systems-level change in a particular condition has occurred, which may be described by examining the common properties of the differentially expressed genes. The GO enrichment analysis may answer whether the genes participate in the same metabolic or signaling pathway and perform similar biochemical functions. Here, we present enrichment analysis related to ontology pathways [ [30](#B30-life-13-01364)]. After identifying AF-related genes, the authors analyzed the expression profiles, prognosis, immune infiltration, and methylation characteristics of these genes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, the common histological subtype of lung cancer. They found CBX3, BUB1, DSC2, P4HA1, and CYP4Z1, differentially expressed between tumor and normal tissues. While CYP4Z1 was positively correlated with overall survival in these patients, CBX3, BUB1, DSC2, and P4HA1 were negatively correlated. Additionally, a hub immune-related gene in AF related to cancer named ANXA4 had been previously identified. Thus, ANXA4 might play crucial roles in AF and cancer, and targeted therapy for ANXA4 might reduce the incidence of AF in cancer patients [ [31](#B31-life-13-01364)]. [32](#B32-life-13-01364)]. Likewise, cardiac apoptosis-related lncRNA competitively binds to miR-539, the miR-539-dependent downregulation the protein PHB2. fission and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes [ [33](#B33-life-13-01364)]. Many network medicine studies show the relevance of irreversible structural remodeling, besides electrical remodeling, for the occurrence, development, diagnosis, and treatment of AF. [34](#B34-life-13-01364)]. Yang et al. (2021) and Qu et al. (2021) also used WGCNA to identify hub mRNAs and non-coding RNAs in AF [ [35](#B35-life-13-01364), [36](#B36-life-13-01364)]. Comparing samples from subjects with and without AF, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulate multiple pathways, such as the modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor production and binding to the CXCR chemokine receptor. Among all DEGs, about half were non-coding RNAs. Five hub modules were significantly negatively and positively correlated to the progression of AF. Besides the hub lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network, the hub protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed, showing the relevance of immune response signaling, such as leukocyte chemotaxis, macrophage activation, and positive regulation of - T cell activation in AF [ [35](#B35-life-13-01364)]. Qu et al. (2021) identified two significant modules and two hub miRNAs (hsa-miR-146b-5p hsa-miR-378a-5p) the AF phenotype and differentially expressed miRNAs and genes were predominantly enriched in inflammation-related functional items. By overlapping the DEGs and predicted target genes, nine genes LIF, MAP3K8, NPY1R, S100A12, at the core region in the miRNA-gene interaction network were identified as hub genes [ [36](#B36-life-13-01364)]. Thus, structural remodeling, inflammation, and the immune system seem relevant in AF pathogenesis. 4. Structural Remodeling [37](#B37-life-13-01364)]. [38](#B38-life-13-01364)]. This meta-analysis included the work of Liu et al. (2020) [ [39](#B39-life-13-01364)]. These authors have found that critical genes such as SPP1, COL5A1, and VCAN are upregulated in AF tissues, concluding that genes related to the ECM are involved in the pathology of AF being promising targets for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Yu et al. (2021) also investigated the relationship between ECM organization and AF progression, besides metabolic dysregulation and the vitamin D response. They observed that hub genes, such as APP, CDH2, SPP1, and STC2, are differentially expressed in this condition [ [40](#B40-life-13-01364)]. Many other studies also point to structural remodeling in AF pathophysiology due to interactome perturbations. [41](#B41-life-13-01364)]. Yu et al. (2021) also found DEGs to fibrosis. They highlighted the CXCR4, TLR4, and CXCR2 genes, the Hippo signaling pathway, and the class A/1 (rhodopsin-like receptors) as having critical roles in AF occurrence and maintenance [ [42](#B42-life-13-01364)]. [43](#B43-life-13-01364)]. Likewise, Zhang et al. (2020) previously discussed the role of the TGF- signaling pathway in AF. Comparing samples from AF and healthy individuals, they found twenty upregulated and three downregulated circRNAs, such as hsa_circ_0000075 and hsa_circ_0082096. In addition, the ceRNA network analysis revealed two upregulated genes, IFNG and GDF7, and one downregulated gene, BMP7 [ [44](#B44-life-13-01364)]. Thus, the TGF- signaling pathway may be relevant to AF fibrosis. [45](#B45-life-13-01364)]. Using a similar approach, Ke et al. (2022) found eight lncRNAs and 43 mRNAs significantly differentially expressed in samples of AF patients compared to subjects with sinus rhythm. Enrichment analysis showed that cardiac muscle contraction pathways were involved in developing the disease. The expression of miR-490-3p was downregulated, while LOC101928304 and LRRC were upregulated in myocardial tissue of patients with AF [ [46](#B46-life-13-01364)]. [47](#B47-life-13-01364)]. Thus, besides cell morphology, the immune system may also be involved in AF. 5. Inflammation and Immune System [48](#B48-life-13-01364)]. Liu et al. (2021) identified the persistence-disease-associated module involved in the electrical remodeling and the susceptibility-disease module related to the inflammatory process. This study obtained RNA sequencing data from 235 left atrial appendage samples from the GEO database. The top lncRNAs/mRNAs with the highest variance were used to build a gene co-expression network by WGCNA, whereas MIAT and LINC00964 were identified as key lncRNAs [ [33](#B33-life-13-01364)]. [49](#B49-life-13-01364)]. Ying et al. (2023) showed that regulatory T cells, resting natural killer cells, active mast cells, and neutrophils may be closely related to nonparoxysmal AF. The permanent subtype was associated with six hub such as TYROBP, PTPRC, ITGB2, SPI1, PLEK, and CSF1R, while the persistent subtype was associated with five hub genes, such as JAM3, S100P, ARPC5, TRIM34, and GREB1L [ [50](#B50-life-13-01364)]. Thus, increasing evidence also demonstrates the significant role of the immune system in this condition. [51](#B51-life-13-01364)]. In addition, they identified several novel disease-associated genes, miRNAs, and pathways, including microRNA-34a-5p, which might target RCAN1 and PPP3R1 to regulate persistent AF through the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. Likewise, Wei et al. (2022) showed that plasma cells and M2 macrophages significantly increase in AF, while follicular helper T cells and activated dendritic cells significantly decrease. Among 20 mainly related to muscle contraction, the autophagosome, and bone morphogenetic protein binding, and focused on the calcium signaling pathway, ferroptosis, and ECM-receptor interaction, the authors identified five potential key diagnostic genes. They were GPR22, COG5, GALNT16, OTOGL, and MCOLN3. Potential circRNA such were also shown to be biomarkers for postoperative AF, and immune genes TYROBP were addition, macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils were significantly infiltrated in left atrial tissue [ [53](#B53-life-13-01364)]. Zheng et al. (2022) also observed more M2 macrophages infiltrated in AF patients and more gamma delta T cells and resting mast cells. However, there were fewer activated mast cells and regulatory T cells. Three novel hub genes were identified in this work. While BEX2 and GALNT16 were downregulated, higher levels of HTR2B were registered [ [54](#B54-life-13-01364)]. All these data together strongly suggest that immune cells may interact with specific genes in AF. [53](#B53-life-13-01364), [54](#B54-life-13-01364)]. These data corroborate the work of Fan et al. (2020), who discovered 150 upregulated and 110 downregulated genes comparing samples from AF and sinus rhythm groups. Hub nodes such as CXCR4, CXCR2, C3, CXCL11, CCR2, AGTR2, and CXCL1 were in the inflammatory response, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, and neuro-active ligand-receptor interaction pathways. Furthermore, this study identified essential miRNAs such as miR-3123, miR-548g-3p, and miR-9-5p [ [55](#B55-life-13-01364)]. Yang et al. (2022) pointed out four other hub genes, including CXCL12, LTBP1, LOXL1, and IGFBP3 recruits monocytes and lymphocytes, was also indicated by Liu et al. (2021) as a hub DEG in AF along with IL7R, TNFSF13B, and CD8A associated with regulatory T cells or natural killer-cell-activated immune cells [ [57](#B57-life-13-01364)]. These data show that CXCL12 plays a vital role in regulating the local inflammatory response and immune cell infiltration. Thus, this cytokine may be used as a biomarker to distinguish subsets of AF. Interestingly, Lal et al. (2022) indicated metformin as a top repurposed drug candidate for AF, discussing the proximity of NPPB (brain natriuretic peptide) peptide suppresses the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system activity, reducing the activation of nuclear factor-kB and the production of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, and consequently, oxidative stress [ [58](#B58-life-13-01364)]. 6. Integrating Data Using Bioinformatic Tools [Table 1](#life-13-01364-t001)presents the top 30 biological entities cited in at least five articles and their related information. [Figure 2](#life-13-01364-f002)shows the respective protein-protein network that may allow the determination of topological parameters useful for disease modeling. [Table 2](#life-13-01364-t002)presents data from enrichment analysis concerning ontology pathways. The top 30 biological entities mined from AF network studies are mainly related to the inflammatory process and the immune system. 7.

Network nodes (circles) represent all the proteins produced by a single protein-coding gene locus. Edges represent protein-protein-specific and meaningful associations, i.e., functional and physical interactions, with an evidence score of 0.900. Colored nodes represent query proteins and the first shell of interactors, while white nodes encompass the second shell of interactors. Empty nodes refer to proteins with an unknown 3D structure; filled nodes have some 3D structure known or predicted. |from||Entry||Protein Names||Gene Names| statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
