Apologies were noted from Dr Stephen Bergin, Professor Nichola Rooney and Mr Brendan Whittle. 26/22 Item 2 - Declaration of Interests 26/22.1 Mr Stewart asked if anyone had interests to declare releva nt to any items on the agenda. Mr Clayton advised that in advance of any discussion on the terms of reference for the COVID -19 Inquiry, he should declare an interest as he is involved in some work around this in his role in Unison. - | Page 2 | - 27/22 Item 3 - Minutes of previous meeting held on 17 Febr uary 2022 27/22.1 The minutes of the Board meeting held on 17 February 2022 were APPROVED as an accurate r ecord of that meeting. 28/22 Item 4 28/22.2 28/22.3 28/22.4 28/22.5 28/22.6 28/22.7 Mr Stewart went through the action log and asked Mr Wilson to update members on the first two actions relating to the minimum wage. Mr Wilson advised that from a contractual point of view, there are no specific clauses requiring organisations PHA contracts to pay staff the living wage, but there is a general clause about applying with all aspects of the law. He added that there is some further work being done in looking at the crossover between the living wage and the national minimum wage. He advised the national living wage applies from age 23. In terms of whether all PHA staff are paid at the appropriate level, he reported that he is content that this is the case. Mr Clayton said that the issue for him is not the national minimum wage, but the real living wage. He advised that there is an Executive policy around this and while he was content that PHA's contracted organisations pay the minimum wage, he said that this is not the real living wage. He explained that the real living wage is set every November by the Living Wage Foundation and currently sits at \u00a39.90 per hour, but the national living wage will only increase to \u00a39.50 from 1 April 2022 so there is a gap. He added that the increase in the cost of living will likely see the real living wage increase again, and this is the level that PHA should benchmark to. He noted that from June 2022 the Executive is committed to paying the real living wage. Ms McCaig advised that PHA is not funded t o the levels of the real living wage and there is no commitment to go beyond the national living wage, adding that this is much wider than just the PHA. She said that PHA will take cognisance of the direction of the Executive. Mr Clayton queried whether Ms McCaig should raise this matter with the Department. He said that this is a Department of Finance policy and it should be resourced across all Government bodies and he queried whether this is being factored into the Executive budget. He felt that PHA should be setting an example in this area. Ms McCaig said that she agreed with Mr Clayton but explained that PHA cannot go ahead of an Executive commitment and act in isolation. She said that she was happy to go and talk to the Department about this (Action 1 - Ms McCaig) . Mr Stewart noted that there is a difficulty if a rate is already established in an existing contract. The Chair said that he did not expect contracts to be changed, but Ms McCaig suggested that they could be if the policy - | Page 3 | - 28/22.8 28/22.9 position sup ported that, but she did not know at what stage the Executive decisions are. Mr Stewart noted that action 3 relating to the \"buddy\" project was complete as this initiative has now commenced, and that action 4 has also been completed as information regardi ng the PPI webinars had been shared with members. He said that action 5 regarding the future planning group looking at health intelligence would be picked up later in the meeting by the Chief Executive. Moving onto the outstanding actions from the Januar y meeting, Mr Stewart said that a timetable of workshops is being prepared and that fuel poverty will form part of one of those. He noted that the Chief Executive will bring an update on vacant posts to a future meeting and that the Chief Executive would update members later in the meeting regarding his discussion with Ms Heather Stevens. 29/22 Item 5 - Chair's Business 29/22.1 29/22.2 29/22.3 29/22.4 29/22.5 The Chair began by commenting that the financial outlook was not good for those on benefits. The Chair commented on the launch of the Food Standards Agency UK Strategy but said there needs to be more work done in this area. The Chair advised that he had received correspondence from Mr Paul Montgomery in the Department of Health which relates to a finding in the report on the resignation of the RQIA Board and that it indicated that if Boards wish to approach the Minister, they are free to do so, but should keep their Sponsor Branch apprised. Ms Henderson noted that she was unable to attend the recent business planning workshop and asked about the status of the plan and the next steps. Mr Wilson reported that the outworkings of that workshop have been taken away and that PHA will be taking a s lightly different approach with its business plan for next year in that there will 8 high level priority KPIs and an accompanying action plan with further KPIs. He said that the draft plan has gone back to relevant staff to be reviewed and will be brought back to the Board when it is ready. He added that there has been some discussion with the Department about the timing of the submission of the plan, and that there is some flexibility in that regard. He reiterated that members will be kept updated. Ms Henderson sought clarity that the Board would be seeing the plan again in the next 2/3 weeks and Mr Wilson confirmed that the plan will be circulated to members in advance of the next meeting. Mr Stewart confirmed that the principles that were established at the pre- meeting in advance of the workshop have been followed through. Ms Mann -Kler asked how PHA intends to respond to the correspondence from the Department. She said that it was an important - | Page 4 | - 29/22.6 opportunity to explore, and that the timing of it is int eresting. The Chair advised that the Minister is keen to meet with Boards and he assured members that he will be raising this matter at the next meetings of the Health Chairs' Forum and the Public Sector Chairs' Forum. He said that the Minister should be able to be reached through both the Private Office and the Special Advisor (SpAd). Mr Clayton noted the reference in the Chair's Report to Ernst and Young (EY) carrying out work on the development of the new operating model for PHA and asked for more det ail on that. He queried whether this had been a decision made by the Department or by the PHA. He expressed concern that they had been brought in without the Board's knowledge and he noted the point about ensuring that they carry out the work that PHA wa nts them to do. With regard to the business plan, he hoped that the squeeze on living standards will feature within one of the 8 KPIs. The Chief Executive said that he would pick up matters relating to the review of PHA later in the meeting under Item 11. 30/22 Item 6 - Chief Executive's Business 30/22.1 30/22.2 30/22.3 30/22.4 30/22.5 The Chief Executive reported that the Minister has made an announcement regarding the future of Test Trace Protect (TTP) in Northern Ireland. He said that in advance of the announcement being made public he addressed those staff working in contact tracing as it was felt to be important that they heard it from him. He advised that an e-mail was issued to staff and it would be shared with members. Mr Wilson gave an overview of the e- mail tha t was issued and outlined the changes to testing which are that PC R testing is no longer recommended for most people, apart from those for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. However, he advised that home testing PCR kits are available. He explained that publicly accessible testing sites will close and local T rusts will provide testing to support clinical care. With regard to regular asymptomatic testing, Mr Wilson said that this will continue to be advised for those working and visiting healthcare settings, but for workplaces and education settings (after Eas ter), it will cease. However, he added that it will continue in special schools until at least the end of June 2022. Mr Wilson advised that contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and June 2022. Mr Stewart asked about the next steps for PHA. Mr Wilson advised that the contracts of employment for contact tracing staff will be honoured until the end of June. However, he added that any staff who have been working for over 2 years and now have permanent employment rights will also have their contracts honoured and work is ongoing with HR in this regard. As a result of the reduction in testing, he said that contact - | Page 5 | - 30/22.6 30/22.7 30/22.8 tracing will be scaled back, but contact tracers will be used to work in other areas, f or example they could assist in work relating to the Ukraine response and refugees. He advised that they will most likely be involved in work relating to clinically vulnerable people and ensuring that they can access testing, antivirals and clinical servi ces. However, he said that a lot of the detail has yet to be determined on this as further clarity is awaited from the Department. Mr Stewart asked how many staff this will impact, and the Chief Executive replied that it would be around 200, but he noted that with staff looking for new jobs there is presently an attrition rate of 10/15 staff per week. He added that the last group to leave will likely be those who are about to retire, or who have come out of retirement to help. Ms Henderson asked who wil l be carrying out surveillance and how it can be done in the absence of PCR or LFD testing. The Chief Executive advised that PHA will still have a significant role in terms of surveillance, and explained that waste water is being used as a type of early alert system, and that PHA will undertake outbreak management. Dr Owen clarified that surveillance is part and parcel of the role of the PHA. She advised that the ONS survey will continue and it is a better indicator of prevalence. She said that testing only picks up a small percentage of those who have COVID -19 whereas the ONS survey is population based. In relation to LFD testing and the removal of the provision of free tests, Mr Clayton asked how people can still access these at a reasonable cost give n other pressures as there is a risk of individuals profiteering. He asked how much this decision has been driven by financial issues. He noted that some staff will still be able to access tests while others will not and asked if there has been an assess ment on this from a budgetary perspective. Mr Stewart added that he would like the view of the Director of Public Health of this announcement and if PHA is content that it represents a sensible move. The Chief Executive responded that some of this is HSC policy which is directed by the Minister so PHA has no control. He added that it would be too early to give an assessment as the detail of this was only received yesterday evening and this morning. He said that the question as to whether this is being driven by the budget is one for the Minister to determine. He advised that PHA had extended, at risk, the contracts of contact tracing staff up to the end of June 2022 as it will be able to cover these in its budget. Ms McCaig echoed this, noting that PHA usually carries a surplus in its management and administration budget and therefore it was felt to be a risk that PHA could manage. In terms of the wider context, she advised that some planning assumptions have been made, but it does not mean they are the same assumptions when it comes to managing the disease and disease outbreak. She said that these two areas have been kept separate. She added that she is still trying to get information on the financial outlook for the HSC. The Chief Executive said th at the pandemic will come to an end at some - | Page 6 | - 30/22.9 30/22.10 30/22.11 30/22.12 30/22.13 point, and some of the decisions being made are based on the scientific evidence that the dominant variant in Northern Ireland is BA2 which accounts for over 95% of cases and does not have a severe impact on health. He advised that Northern Ireland has the lowest rate of cases across the UK, and even though people are being admitted to hospital, very few are on supported oxygen or ending up in ICU. He said that TTP was put in place to prevent severe illness and death so with numbers of cases reducing, the need to isolate and test is also reducing as this was always going to be the case, although it has happened quite quickly. He advised that the health impact of Omicron has only been known since mid- January and while he welcomed its reduced impact, he noted that there still remains a section of the population that needs to be protected. He added that the functions of surveillance, testing and contact tracing will remain with PHA to ensure these people are protec ted. Mr Wilson advised that LFD s are still available free of charge for those who develop symptoms. The Chief Executive advised that there is a number of programmes which will be transitioned into PHA. He began by explaining that the vaccination program me which has been led by the Department over the last 2 years will transfer to PHA as vaccination sits within the remit of PHA. He said that the spring booster programme will be led by the Department, but then the autumn programme will be led by PHA. He added that a workshop on this is taking place this afternoon. The Chief Executive said that the Vaccine Management System (VMS) will also transfer to PHA as well a number of other digital platforms and he has been in discussion with Mr Dan West to get a stocktake on this work. The Chief Executive reported that there is work ongoing between the different UK nations and the new UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to determine relationships, i.e. what matters will be dealt with at a national level, and what matters will be devolved. He noted that Northern Ireland will have a bigger reliance on UKHSA than other nations, and therefore discussions will be taking place over the next 6 months. However, he expressed concern that UKHSA is seeing a considerable cut in its budget and that may have implications for PHA. The Chief Executive advised that he and the Chair attended an Extraordinary Sponsorship Meeting with the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and Deputy Chief Medical Officer (DCMO) on Tuesday which he said wa s positive and helpful. He said that there was a discussion about the restart of sponsorship activities going forward, although he commented that the PHA had had a lot of Sponsorship Meetings with the Department over the last 2 years. He added that there will be an Accountability Meeting with the new Permanent Secretary. The Chief Executive reported that in addition to issues relating to the COVID -19 response, there was discussion about resilience in PHA and - | Page 7 | - 30/22.14 30/22.15 30/22.16 30/22.17 30/22.18 30/22.19 30/22.20 staffing given the number of PHA staff who are likely to retire soon. He said that PHA does not presently have as many public health consultants as it would like. He said that there was also discussion about PHA's approach to its Business Plan for next year. He added that there was reference to how Northern Ireland can respond as a nation to the Ukraine crisis, but noting that refugees come under the auspices of the Executive Office, and within HSC, it sits under social care even though there may be significant public health issues. The Chief Executive said that there was discussion at the meeting on the new planning model, as well as on the development of Partnership Agreements, which was an issue that had come out of the recent report into the resignation of the RQIA Board. He advised that these Agreements will be developed over the next 12/18 months. The Chair agreed that it was a positive meeting. Mr Stewart said that based on his previous experience, he was confident that the new Permanent Secretary will wish to see the new Partnership Agreements put into place and that it will be important for the Board to meet with him as soon as possible. The Chief Executive highlighted some risks. Beginning with the PHA's relationship with UKHSA, he said that there is a risk of services being withd rawn that would previously have been provided. In terms of the vaccination programme and the digital elements which accompany it, he highlighted that there is a risk of no additional financial resources , but given the necessity of the programme, PHA will run it at risk. He advised that he had no conduct issues to bring to the Board's attention. The Chief Executive reported that the new Permanent Secretary will take up post on 4 April, and 1 April will see the closure of HSCB and its transition into the Department of Health. The Chief Executive said that he felt that the recent workshop on the Business Plan had gone well and that KPIs will be developed and a further iteration shared with members by e- mail. He added that the \"buddy\" initiative has now commenced and HSCQI will be developing an evaluation. The Chief Executive reported that he had attended the launch of the \"Breastfeeding Welcome Here\" scheme with Translink and he had also attended the launch by the Minister of the revised Nutrition Standards. He added that he and Mr Stewart had visited Kilcooley on Monday for the launch of the Sustrans Big Wheel and Walk initiative. Ms Mann -Kler asked how the meeting with the Permanent Secretary had gone. The Chief Executive reiterated that the meeting was very positive and the CMO was very complimentary about the work of PHA in its response to COVID -19 and that he is looking forward to working with PHA through the review. The Chair echoed that and indicat ed that the - | Page 8 | - 30/22.21 new Permanent Secretary will be attending a Board meeting soon as he felt it is important to have constructive dialogue, both with the Permanent Secretary, and with the Sponsor Branch. Ms Henderson asked about specialist advice for the populat ion in terms of nutrition. She noted that there is information about taking Vitamin D, folic, Vitamin B6, but she asked about general advice about nutritional supplements. She felt that people do not generally have a balanced diet and asked about getting messages out. Mr Wilson said that he would be happy to have a discussion about this outside the meeting, but in essence he explained that this is a crowded space in Northern Ireland as in addition to PHA, there is both the Food Standards Agency and Safefo od. However, he advised that there are some resources available on NI Direct and there is a PHA website, \"Choose 2 Live Better\" which although it does not cover the area of supplementation, it does signpost to other resources. 31/22 Item 31/22.4 31/22.5 Ms McCaig said that the Finance Report showed the position as at the end of January 2022, but she would give members an update on the February position. Ms McCaig advised that the year to date position had remained largely unchanged with a surplus created by a combination of some timing issues relating t o programme spend, an overspend on COVID -19, an underspend in management and administration and a surplus in one area of ring fenced funding relating to Delivering Care that the Department has not agreed to retract. Ms McCaig said that that the projected year end surplus is around \u00a3500k, but she advised that she has been informed of a potential significant slippage and she has asked for a briefing on this by tomorrow. She said that while she is still looking for opportunities across the PHA and wider HSC budget, she wished to highlight to the Board that PHA will have a \u00a3500k surplus, but this figure will likely increase. She added that there are other risks to be managed including internal programme expenditure, management and administration and ring fenced funding related to COVID -19. She said that additional information regarding annual leave has been obtained, but there is still some clarity required on annual leave within contact tracing as this is managed outside the main system. She reported that s he is not as concerned about Trust funding as progress has been made. She said that there is work ongoing to get a final cost for contact tracing. Ms McCaig reported that the capital budget of \u00a314m, of which \u00a312.6m is related to R&D, is expected to break even. Ms Henderson thanked Ms McCaig for setting out the position clearly and she expressed confidence that budget holders are doing all that - | Page 9 | - 31/22.6 31/22.7 31/22.8 31/22.9 they can. In terms of next year's budget, she asked where PHA is going in terms of filling vacant posts, and how will PHA get its normal working plan back on schedule following COVID -19. She noted that bowel screening will not be back on track until August. She offered her congratulations to the team for their work during what has been a tough set of circumstance s and she commended the reporting which she said has been very clear. Ms McCaig said that budget holders are w orking to manage the situation, but noted that there is a reliance on the ability of PHA's partner organisations to be able to respond quickly. She advised that while she did not know what the final outturn would be, she would do her best. She said she would like to see the \u00a3200k retracted by the Department and she would do what she could, and she would have a better update by the time of the nex t meeting. Mr Stewart said that if PHA were able to achieve a break even position it would be miraculous. Ms McCaig agreed that it will be challenging. Mr Stewart asked what the implications would be for PHA if it did not achieve break even. Ms McCaig noted that it would be an underspend and , as such, there may be a public perception issue. However, in the scheme of the overall health budget, she said that it would not be huge, but it will be picked up on by External Audit. She did not expect that it would result in a significant challenge from an accountability point of view given that this has not been a normal year. Ms Henderson asked about the scale of the potential slippage that was identified yesterday. Ms McCaig said that she would prefer to w ait until she had received a briefing and spoken to the budget holder before commenting further. She undertook to update Ms Henderson outside of the meeting (Action 2 - Ms McCaig) . Mr Clayton asked why the Department is reluctant to take back the \u00a3200k r elating to Delivering Care and if the surplus is due to recruitment issues. Ms McCaig explained that COVID -19 had caused a delay, but at the same time once an organisation has declared its budget it is expected to utilise it. In normal circumstances, she advised that there is an expectation that ring fenced funding can be returned but there is some diplomacy required in this case. She assured members that she is working on number of fronts to resolve this. The Chief Executive agreed that this has been an exceptional year with a lot of staff from health intelligence, HSCQI and nursing being redeployed into contact tracing and other parts of the emergency response, which has meant that progress in areas such as this has not been able to take place. He sai d he would have expected the money to have been spent, but at the same time he was not expecting people to do 2 jobs and he accepted that tasks that needed to be done were not done, but this was a decision he had to make. Ms McCaig concurred saying that P HA is not in a situation that it would normally be, but budget managers have worked hard and she will handle whatever happens at - | Page 10 | - 31/22.10 31/22.11 the end of the year no matter what the final outturn is. Mr Morton said that several of the posts that had to be recruited wer e of a high level, therefore these jobs had to be matched by HR and HR staff were also responding to the pandemic. He advised that there is a recovery plan in place and he hoped that the recruitment for these posts would be on track by the summer. The Bo ard noted the Finance Report. 32/22 Item 8 - Update on COVID -19 32/22.1 32/22.2 32/22.3 32/22.4 32/22.5 32/22. 6 Dr Owen presented the latest data relating to COVID -19. She showed how the incidence rate in Northern Ireland has been declining whereas it has been increasing in other parts of the UK. She hoped that cases here would not start to increase again as in the other regions. She then showed the incidence by vaccination status. Dr Owen presented the breakdown of cases by lineage which demonstrated that the majority of cases here are of the BA2 variant. She showed a breakdown of the case numbers by age which highlighted a fall in the number of cases in the 10- 19 year old category and that the highest number is now among the 30- 39 age group. Dr Owen advised that there has been a lot of work carried out in relation to hospital based outbreaks with PHA staff having regular meetings with the Southern Trust. She said that the increase in hospital acquired infections is having an impact on the delivery of other services. In terms of hospital bed occupancy, she said that the data indicate that there i s a low number of COVID -19 inpatients. The Chief Executive advised that at a recent meeting, it was agreed to move away from the notification process for deaths and use the data on the HCN Index and PAS. Dr Owen reported that there are 152 care homes where there is an outbreak, of which 147 are nursing homes, and that the majority of these are where both staff and patients are affected. She said that a lot of this data is being picked up by routine testing. Mr Morton added that there is not a pattern of acuity and that the booster programme is adding a layer of protection. He hoped that the number of cases will remain low. Dr Owen showed the number of vaccinations administered per day and commented that the uptake in the 5/11 year old programme has been particularly poor with only around 2,500 so there is work ongoing to promote that. She advised that the spring booster programme is about to be rolled out through GPs, community pharmacies and Trusts. She added that immuno- supressed individuals will receive a spring booster. Dr Owen advised that the draft terms of reference for the COVID -19 Public Inquiry have been published and although this is a UK -wide Inquiry, devolved nations can undertake their own. She said that it is a - | Page 11 | - 32/22. 7 32/22. 8 32/22. 9 32/22.1 0 wide ranging Inquiry and will cover many aspects including testing, contact tracing and how organisations responded. She added that it will be interesting to see the volume of evidence that is put together. She advised that the draft terms of reference are out for public consultation so people are being asked whether they feel it covers all of the areas they would expect. She said the Inquiry will look at how families were impacted by COVID -19. Mr Stewart commented that while case numbers in Northern Ireland appear to be fl at lining, a high number of people seem to be infected. The Chief Executive said that this was raised with the Department, and the figures presented relate to testing and the ONS survey. However, he noted that people's behaviour has changed as has the ability to pick up on whether people get themselves tested. Furthermore, he said that people's social behaviour has also changed and they are going out in wider gathering s and there is less use of face coverings and less adherence to social distancing. He added that this is to be expected as there will be a degree of COVID -19 fatigue. On the flip side, he noted that hospital number s are reducing as are the number of people in ICU and the number of deaths. However, he pointed out that this is related to th e current variant and a new variant could emerge that PHA needs to be ready to deal with. Mr Clayton asked if PHA will have the ability to ramp up its contact tracing operation if it needs to. He asked whether the asymptomatic testing in care homes will continue given the high level of outbreaks there and if care workers will continue to be able to avail of testing. He commented that the low level of uptake in the vaccination programme for 5/11 year olds may be due to a lack of information coming out fro m schools or GPs. He added that there may be some work required in convincing parents about doing this. He commented that it is bizarre how the number of cases here remains high, but also flat lines. Mr Wilson said that he agreed with Mr Clayton's point about the vaccination programme for 5/11 year olds and that PHA finds itself in a curious position because normally this type of programme would be carried out by school nurses and the approach here is different than in other parts of the UK. He felt that this is a difficult issue as there is a resistance from parents to vaccinate their children and maybe a new variant emerging could turn the tide. Mr Clayton said that he would have expected information to come out from schools or GPs. Mr Wilson noted t hat accessibility has also been an issue for the vaccination programme. He said that while the big regional centres have had an impact, he pointed out that in Wales for example, centres have been located in town centres. The Chief Executive confirmed that care home testing will continue and staff testing will also continue until at least the end of June. He said that the school cell in PHA, which has been busy over the last 2 years, is seeing less activity. He noted that while there has been a lot of ca ses - | Page 12 | - 32/22.1 1 32/22.1 2 among schoolchildren, less of these are coming through to PHA as this beginning to become normalised within a school context. He added that there will continue to be variations of COVID -19. Mr Morton noted that there needs to be a focus on Long COVID as although the intelligence on this is only starting to emerge, there is evidence to suggest that it will have a detrimental impact. While symptomatically the current variant may be mild, he said that people will not want to have a lifetime of fatigue a nd this should be borne in mind when considering whether to vaccinate children. He added that normally Northern Ireland has a good record when it comes to childhood vaccination. Mr Clayton said that although he had heard the announcement about the vaccination programme, he was not aware of the pathway. Mr Stewart suggested that as the terms of reference for the COVID Inquiry are out for consultation, the Board may wish to take a view as to whether it makes a submission to the Inquiry and this should be put on the agenda for the next meeting (Action 3 - Secretariat). The Chief Executive advised that PHA is having a meeting with the Directorate of Legal Services about how it prepares itself for the Inquiry. He noted that there has been no decision as to whether Northern Ireland will have its own local Inquiry, but he said that he would be happy to come back to the Board and report on the outcome of that meeting which will be about how PHA prepares its records in the event of having to make a submission (Action 4 - Chief Executive) . The Chair advised that a meeting has been offered by the Deputy Director of the Inquiry to Health Chairs in England. 33/22 Item 9 - Update from Chair of Remuneration Committee 33/22.1 This item was deferred to the next meeting. At this point the Chair left the meeting 34/22 Item 10 - Family Nurse Partnership Report 2020 (PHA/0 2/03/22) 34/22.1 34/22.2 Ms Emily Roberts joined the meeting for this item Mr Morton said that Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) is a flagship programme in PHA. As part of nursing reforms, he advised that the Nursing and Midwifery Task Group Report was launched in 2020 and it set out a number of commitments, including the need to support the development of public health nursing roles across Northern Ireland, as well as to enhance the role of nurses and FNP. He said that FNP sits within this strategic context and over the last year there has been additional investment with another 5 practitioners employed. Ms Roberts delivered a presentation and began by out lining the background to FNP and stating the objectives of the programme. She - | Page 13 | - 34/22.3 34/22.4 34/22.5 34/22.6 34/22. 7 34/22.8 highlighted some of the benefits and then moved on to give an overview of the current profile. She advised that the expansion of the programme has resulted in 850 individuals accessing it and each nurse having a caseload of 25 young mothers. Ms Roberts reported the key outcomes of the programme and showed that there was a low attrition rate. She added that the data indicated that there were benefits for the children across each of the 5 main areas of child development. She advised that 97% of the children have their immunisations up to date after 24 months and a low number of infants have been hospitalised due to injury. Ms Roberts advised that there were 3 key actions car ried over from 2019 and 1 of these has been completed with the other 2 in progress. She said that the information system continues to be a challenge as the current system needs to be improved. She reported that there is now a data analyst in PHA and BSO is also providing support. She said that the existing system is not smart enough for the data analysis that is required. Ms Roberts said that there has been good feedback from participants on the programme and in particular she highlighted the positive r eviews from a breastfeeding session with 3 of the young mothers on Zoom. Ms Roberts said that the Board is being asked to note the Report and to consider the need for a Northern Ireland study to look at the long term benefits of the programme. Mr Stewart asked what the scale of the challenge was in terms of expanding the programme. Ms Roberts advised that there are presently around 900 teenage pregnancies per year, and that rate is plateauing, but the programme is presently reaching around 850 young people. In the early stages, she said that it was only 37/40% of those young people so there has been an improvement but until there is further investment there will be people that the programme will not reach. She added that the most vulnerable people are likely to have the best outcomes. Mr Stewart sought clarity on the arrangement with the University of Colorado. Ms Roberts explained that it has the licence and the fidelity measures and PHA pays for consultancy fees. Mr Stewart asked therefore if PHA i s tied into the use of the licence permanently. Mr Morton explained that it is an internationally licenced programme and Northern Ireland is a member. He added that it is useful to stay engaged to be able to do comparisons with other countries and Northern Ireland is seen as an exemplar. He noted that what is not known at this stage is the impact ten years after the programme for the participants and what their outcomes would have been had there not been this intervention, and therefore it is best to rem ain within the international community until there is some long term data available. - | Page 14 | - 34/22.9 34/22.10 34/22.11 34/22.12 Mr Irvine commented that there are a lot of American euphemisms in the Report. He noted that while the benefits of the work have been highlighted, he would like to see measureable outcomes. He said that it was reported that there are 900 teenage pregnancies, but if only 850 of these individuals are being reached, how can the outcomes rather than the benefits be measured. He added that there is not an assurance that each pregnant woman receives a good intervention across a range of attributable benefits, and therefore there needs to be some baseline data. He asked that if the aim is to incrementally grow by 5/10% each year, why are there still people not being reached. He felt that the long term benefits are not necessarily visible. He asked whether after 2 years there is added benefit to the health system . He suggested that there should be a test group who are monitored 3/4 years after the programme. He asked whether the money spent is being directed in the right way and if outcomes are being delivered in the right way. Ms Roberts agreed that there needs to be a baseline. She said that once the data systems have been improved and the data in place then it will be possible to measure impact going forward. She agreed that there is a need for a longitudinal study in order to get the evidence. She said that from speaking to the young mothers, it is clear that they are benefitting from the programme and that is evidenced in the Report. Mr Morton added that there will be a supplementary report that will be produced in the next 8/12 weeks which will look at critical development milestones and health data, i.e. are children reaching key milestone s. He said that there will be a focus on mental health and emotional wellbeing. He assured members that the programme will focus on key data and also the socio- economic benefits. He report ed that some mothers are moving into education and employment so this demonstrates that having had that FNP intervention, it can set up a young mother for life. Ms Mann -Kler asked for an update on the investment in a long term study. She commented that h aving seen previous reports on FNP and its impact, it is a profound piece of work where there are lifelong changes for individuals which are not evidenced in the savings to the HSC for early intervention. She said that by teaching people how to have a health y family and healthy relationships brings benefits, and there is a need to demonstrate that impact at a societal level so she would be supportive of a socio- economic study. She asked whether PHA publicises this Report and whilst understanding that ther e has been a delay to this Report, she asked when the 2021 Report would be produced. Mr Morton advised that a business case would need to be put together and submitted to the Agency Management Team (AMT) for the socio - economic study and then one of the local universities could carry out that piece of work. He noted that a study could cost between \u00a350k and \u00a3100k but this would be money well spent if the long term benefits to society can be demonstrated. In relation to the earlier work, that would - | Page 15 | - 34/22.13 34/22.14 34/22.15 34/22.16 34/22.17 34/22.18 need to be scaled up and the progress of young mothers tracked over a 5/10 year period. He said that colleagues in R&D could assist with this. Mr Wilson advised that the Report is promoted and published, but there is a balance to be struck with programmes of thi s type in terms of promoting the benefits, but not being seen to target new people. He noted that there has not been much pick up on the Report in the past. Ms Roberts said that the 2021 Report is being worked on and she hoped that it would not be as del ayed, given that the Report is normally completed by June. Mr Clayton said that it is clear that this programme does a lot of good, and he felt that it should be funded centrally given the points made about data and how it links to Programme for Governmen t. He asked whether it would be possible to map this programme against Trust data from a social services point of view. He acknowledged that there may be some instances where the individuals are still in care, but the benefits of the programme could be m apped against child protection data. He suggested that there may be partner organisations in the community and voluntary sector who could demonstrate this. He added that a socio - economic study would be beneficial. Ms Roberts said that getting data from social services should be possible. Dr Keaney noted the data about the reducing number of injuries and said that this was a good outcome. She suggested that a reduction in the incidence of sudden infant death would be an outcome. Mr Morton agreed and said that this programme is about giving mothers and babies time to build a relationship and it creates hope and when you hear the stories first hand from mothers it gives a sense of the learning that there is from a healthcare design point of view. He noted that no other service has a situation where 1 care worker has a caseload of 25. Ms McCaig said that she found the report interesting and she asked whether the data can be used to support the prevention of pregnancy. She added that when an individual becomes pregnant , is there a way of using the data differently to target a more effective communication to reduce pregnancies. Mr Morton said that this is a good point and it would be worth taking this away to see if there is anything furth er than can be done. He added that there is some evidence of participating in this programme reduces the rate of a second pregnancy as the mothers are more awareness of areas such as sexual health and family planning. Ms McCaig said that there is a lot o f information about the profile of individuals who may find themselves on this programme so it would be good to be able to support these individuals before they become pregnant. Ms Roberts said that efforts are being made to reduce teenage pregnancies and agreed some of the information from this programme could be used in a different way. Mr Stewart thanked Ms Roberts for her presentation sand said that members understood and appreciated the importance of this - | Page 16 | - 34/22.19 programme. He hoped that it will be possible to find the funding for the longitudinal study. The Board noted the Family Nurse Partnership Report 2020. 35/22 Item 1 1 - Update on the Development of a new Operating Model for PHA 35/22.1 35/22.2 35/22.3 35/22.4 The Chief Executive delivered a presentation giving an update on the development of a new operating model for PHA. He began by reminding members that the Hussey Review had been carried out and this had resulted in 4 recommendations, but as this review had been carried out during the pan demic, its focus had been on health protection and since then the context has changed. He outlined that health protection is not the only function of the PHA as it is also involved in planning, reducing health inequalities, commissioning and service devel opment and the emergence of the new Integrated Care Model will also mean changes, but there will be more on that over the coming months. He said that PHA needs to be able to continue to support the COVID -19 response. The Chief Executive advised that in order to resource the work on developing this new model, an approach was made to the Leadership Centre but this was unsuccessful and initially there was some support from within the Department but due to other pressures this was not sustainable so in Decemb er 2021, Ms Heather Stevens was identified as the lead. He added that Ms Stevens had sought support from the Permanent Secretary about bringing in external consultants and following his endorsement, work began in December and January to develop a specific ation, but the timetable for this work would have gone to the end of June or beginning of July. He advised that the Permanent Secretary had suggested using EY as they had delivered other health service consultancy, and following an approach to the Executi ve Office, it was confirmed that this would fall under the remit of that contract. He added that it would cost \u00a3400k and while the Permanent Secretary has made a recommendation, it is still subject to Ministerial approval. However, he said that he was hopeful as the CMO is also supportive. He explained that if this was not successful, then a public procurement exercise would have to be carried out.. The Chief Executive advised that there will be two phases to the work, design and implementation. He sai d that the design phase will be about identifying what PHA wants and what EY can help with. He noted that there isn't a detailed specification which goes through what PHA wants to see delivered. Mr Stewart asked that, if there is a difficulty in securing approval for the outline business case, can PHA get approval for a scoping exercise if the value of it is below a certain approval level. Ms McCaig explained that the difficulty is more to do with budgetary constraints, and this is tied - | Page 17 | - 35/22.5 35/22.6 35/22.7 35/22.8 up at Ministerial level. Mr Irvine sought clarity as to whether the outline business case is for the consultancy for the scoping exercise and Ms McCaig confirmed that this was the case. Mr Irvine asked then if a further business case is needed for implementation costs . He noted that if this scoping exercise generates ideas that cost money and there is no funding for it, then there is no point in doing the work. Ms McCaig suggested that this will be an iterative process and she agreed that there will be challenges ahead. The Chief Executive acknowledged that there will be different elements that will come out, but some of these PHA can implement by itself while others will need investment. He advised that over the last period, he has met with members of the Health Commi ttee and he has reminded them that they have stated that PHA needs to be bigger so to remember that if PHA puts forward a request for additional funding because this investment will be important to protect the health of the people of Northern Ireland. He said that there are areas PHA can take forward but he has asked the Health Committee members to be mindful of their commitments. The Chief Executive said that once there is clarity on the financial situation progress can be made on delivering many element s of this work all at once. He recalled that the recent listening exercise highlighted an issue with regard to staff knowledge of the strategic vision of the organisation so there needs to be a strategy going forward and staff asked for their help in desi gning an implementation plan. Ms Henderson expressed concern that this process could run for years, but the Chief Executive assured members that he was clear that the design phase is to be completed in 10/12 weeks and that by the end of the summer there w ould be an understanding of the type of organisation that needs to be created. He added that the implementation phase will then be completed over the following 12/18 months. He advised that the team involved in this work have recently completed a similar exercise in the Justice Department in the Republic of Ireland. The Chief Executive advised that the Oversight Board will have 4 members, the Chair, himself, the CMO and the DCMO. He said that at a recent meeting with the CMO and DCMO, there was further discussion on what the membership of the Oversight Board with a suggested that there should be a \"critical friend\", for example Ms Tracey Cooper, the Chief Executive of Public Health Wales, and an individual outside of health with a background in organisational development (OD). He added that the CMO is keen that the Oversight Board should be small and compact and that the PHA Chair should sit on it, but the CMO would like to meet the Board to talk about it and it is hoped that he will attend the workshop on 26 April. He advised that Ms Stevens will be managing the whole process. The Chief Executive said that Health Intelligence will form part of the scoping exercise, and that there is another piece of work that Dr Declan Bradley and Dr Diane Anderson are involved in looking at aligning the - | Page 18 | - 35/22.9 35/22.10 35/22.11 35/22.12 work of public health and health intelligence and moving away from silo working. The Chief Executive advised that the outline of Phase 2 has yet to be agreed, but it will be determined by Phase 1. At this point Ms Mann- Kler left the meeting. Mr Clayton said that \u00a3400k represents a high level of expenditure and asked if EY has capacity to undertake this work. He asked what added value EY can bring given that the Hussey Review pointed out the areas where PHA needed strengthened. He queried if the issue w as about capacity within the Department or about what EY could bring. The Chief Executive replied that the main issue is capacity within the Department as there have been a lot of conversations between he and the Department about wanting to progress this work but there not being any capacity to go out and speak to people, look at other models, bring back a paper and then engage in co- production and co- design. He said that he could not comment on EY's capability, but the assurance is that they have been br ought in through a competitive tendering process with the Executive Office and it will be EY's health group that will do this work. He added that a number of their consultants have worked with PHA staff previously, for example in the design of the nosocom ial dashboard. He acknowledged that there are always risks, but PHA can bring its knowledge to the table and then there is the \"critical friend\" and the individual with an OD background, and they can monitor EY's work and comment on whether their advice i s appropriate. Mr Clayton said that the Chief Executive's overview provided some reassurance, and if it is a capacity issue then that is fair enough, but he noted that PHA will not know about EY's level of public health expertise until they start their wo rk. He noted from the overview of the Sponsorship Review Meeting that the CMO is keen to speak to the Board and have the Chair involved, which shows a spirit of co- operation. The Chief Executive said that he was confident that there will be that co-operation. Mr Stewart said that EY has a level of independence, and added that the reason why consultants can get a bad reputation is because they are not managed so it will be up to Ms Stevens to do that. Ms McCaig agreed that there needs to be a \"hand in gl ove\" approach and co- production. She said that this is a significant organisational change and it is better that PHA is involved. She added that this work is seen to be important enough to have this level of funding spent on it and having that level of i ndependence from EY is also a good thing. She commented that it is important for the whole of Northern Ireland that this is got right. The Chief Executive commented that when the cost was raised in his conversation with the Permanent Secretary, his respo nse was that this work was so important, it could not afford not to be done. - | Page 19 | - 35/22.13 35/22.14 35/22.15 Ms Henderson said that she was trying to understand why PHA is being reviewed and why the review has now expanded. She asked if there was something wrong and if PHA's role need ed to be changed. Mr Stewart said that PHA needs to change in the post -pandemic era. The Chief Executive added that PHA is 10 years old and given that HSCB is closing and the new Integrated Care model taking shape, it is a timely intervention and it is a bout making sure that PHA is fit for the future and can deliver what it needs to deliver and carry out its role of protecting health and reducing inequalities. At this point Mr Clayton left the meeting Mr Morton commented that while he understood the breadth and depth of the review and the oversight arrangements, he noted that it is the CMO and DCMO who are leading this, and felt that there should be ownership across a number of disciplines. He reminded members that PHA's role is about protecting health and social wellbeing so it is important that this is not seen as a medical model and there should be clarity on how public health is being defined. Mr Stewart said that the Chair would agree with those sentiments. The Chief Executive said that there will be a small Oversight Board and it will sit under the CMO because he is the head of PHA's Sponsor Branch. He assured members that the CMO is clear that social wellbeing is a key element as this is defined in legislation. He pointed out that PHA is the only public health organisation in the UK that has social wellbeing in its title. He added that there will be a co- design approach and regular engagement with both AMT and the Board. He advised that the membership of the Programme Board Steering Group has not yet been signed off. The Board noted the update on the d evelopment of a new o perating model for PHA . 36/22 Item 12 - Staff Recognition 36/22.1 The Chief Executive advised that he had a request for one or two Non - Executive Directors to work with Executive Directors on some options regarding staff recognition during the course of the pandemic. He suggested that a short meeting be convened and that there would be some Non- Executive Director input. The proposal was AGREED by members and expressions of interest would be sought through the Chair (Action 5 - Secretariat) . 37/22 Item 13 - Any Other Business 37/22.1 With there being no other business, the Chair thanked members for their time and drew the meeting to a close. - | Page 20 | - 38/22 Item 14 - Details of Next Meeting Wednesday 19 May 2022 at 1:30pm Location to be agreed Signed by Chair: Date: Tracey McCaig Director of Finance April 2022 Finance Report March 2022 Section A: Introduction /Background 1. The PHA Financial Plan for 2021/22 was approved by the PHA Board in the June 2021 Board meeting, which described the opening financial position of the organisation and reported an anticipated breakeven position within 2021/22. 2. The Financial Plan identified a number of areas of projected slippage and how this was to be used to address in -year pressures and priorities. 3. This executive summary report reflects the year-end position as at the end of March 2022 (month 12). Supplement ary detail is provided in Annex A . Section B: Update - Revenue position 4. The PHA has reported a year to date surplus , at February 2022 , of \u00a30.1m (\u00a31.2m at February 2022 ). The forecast year end position as at February 2022 was \u00a31.4m surplus which was managed via a number of measures . 5. In respect of the year to date surplus of \u00a3 0.1m: The PHA Programme budget was under spen t by approx. \u00a31m for the year , primarily caused by slippage within Health Improvement (\u00a30.5m, primarily the Regional Smoking Cessation budget) and Service Development & Screening (\u00a30.25m across various budgets) . There was significant underspend in the Management & Admin budget (c\u00a30.7m). This was expecte d and has been highlighted in previous reports. It primarily relates to the areas of Nurs ing & AHP and Operations, with a high number of vacant posts in this area, along with reduced non -pay expenditure due to different working arrangements associated with the pandemic . Efforts are on -going to fill vacant posts as soon as possible. The level of the surplus decreased at year -end from that previously forecast, primarily as a result of an increased adjustment for Annual Leave unused at 31 M arch 202 2, with many staff unable to fully utilise their annual leave allocation due to the pressures of responding to the pandemic. An overspend is noted in respect of Covid funding (c\u00a3 1.6m) which is a managed position reflecting the plan to use Covid downturn in core operations to partially fund the activity of the Contact Tracing Centre. A small overspend is reported on NDNA Transformation funding ( \u00a324k). This relates to slightly higher than anticipated expenditure on the Suicide Prevention project . 6. The updated position is summarised in the table below.

Table may be subject to minor rounding differences7. It should be noted that the P HA's breakeven limit is approximately c\u00a30.3m and therefore PHA has achieved it 's statutory breakeven duty (subject to Audit). Section C: Management of Risks 8. The risks which have been ar ticulated in previous reports have been managed to arrive at the surplus position outlined above, which is within the breakeven tolerance for the organisation. 9. Internal Programme expenditure outturn . Programme expenditure was monitored closely through out the year with any slippages or pressures highlighted and managed. 10. Management and Administration expenditure outturn. This wa s closely monitored by the Finance team , in conjunction with PHA management, to ensure that the forecast financial position wa s updated on a monthly basis. The underspend was managed in the context of the wider PHA financial outturn 11. Ring -fenced funding - Covid . Expenditure funded via Covid funding was managed within a breakeven position, with the exceptio n of the Contact Tracing Centre where , in liaison with D oH colleagues, Covid downturn within PHA w as identified to offset Covid funding required as part of the planned actions in respect of the financial position . 12. Annual leave. The financial impact of the movement in annual leave usage levels was closely monitored in the approach to 31 March 2022 and the final position as at 31 March 2022 was managed in the context of the PHA 's wider financial position. 13. Funds not yet allocated to Trusts. This risk had reduced in the approach to year end and was managed to achieve the reported position . 14. Covid response impact on PHA. It has been a challenging period for PHA, not least from the focus on the operational nature of the Contact Tracing Service and the support to manage service pressures due to Covid response. Staff members have been diverted internally to support the response , which has impact ed the PHA's ability to fully conduct its business as usual operational requirements. The management of the financial position has continued despite these challenges to arrive at the reported breakeven position. Section D: Update - Capital position 15. The PHA had a capital allocation (CRL) of \u00a3 14.4m for 2021 -22. The majority of this (\u00a313.2m) relates to Research & Development (R&D). 16. Other PHA Capita l includes an allocation of \u00a3 141k for the Congenital Heart Disease Professorship Network to be set up across Ireland and \u00a3 800k for a Covid - 19 Wastewater project. There is also currently a small allocation of \u00a392k for ICT capital expenditure within P HA, and \u00a3141k for ICT linked to the Contact Tracing Centre. 17. The overall summary position is reflected in the following table. 18. R&D expenditure is managed through the R&D Division within PHA, and funds essential infrastructure for research such as information databanks, tissue banks, clinical research facilities, clinical trials units and r esearch networks. The element relating to 'Trusts' is allocated throughout the financial year, and the allocation for 'Other Bodies' is used predominantly within universities - both allocations fund agreed projects that enable and support clinical and acad emic researchers. There was a small underspend of \u00a33k in th is area at year end. 19. CHITIN (Cross -border Healthcare Intervention Trials in Ireland Network) is a unique cross -border partnership between the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the Health Research Board in the Republic of Ireland, to develop infrast ructure and deliver Healthcare Intervention Trials (HITs). The CHITIN project is funded from the EU's INTERREG VA programme, and the funding for each financial year from the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) matches expenditure claims, ensuring a breakeve n position. As is usual, m ost of the activity on this project happen ed during March . 20. The Congenital Heart Disease network funding (\u00a3 141k) is being managed by the Research & Development team, and has achieved full spend in year. The Covid - 19 Wastewater allocation (\u00a3800k) fund ed a QUB project analysing wastewater to help with tracking of outbreaks of Covid -19. There was a small overspend of less than \u00a31k in this area at year end. 21. There was an underspend (c\u00a3 8k) in the area of Covid -19 ICT. All items have been purchased as planned, however there was a small price differenti al to that planned in the final charge for these items, creating the small underspend noted. 22. In overall terms, there was a small underspend of \u00a310k against the CRL funding of \u00a314.4m. Recommendation 23. PHA Board are asked to note the PHA financial update as at March 2022 . Public Health Agency Annex A - Finance Report 2021-22 Month 12 - March 2022 Year End Financial Position (page 2) Administration Budgets (page 5) At the end of the year PHA is reporting an underspend of \u00a30.1m against its annual allocation. All figures in this report are subject to any final year-end audit adjustments. This underspend is primarily the result of underspends on Programme and Administration budgets across the Agency, offset by planned overspends on Covid- 19 funding managed closely with DoH Finance. Over half of the Administration budget relates to the Directorate of Public Health, as shown in the chart below. A significant number of vacant posts remain within PHA, and this is creating slippage on the Administration budget. Management is proactively working to fill vacant posts and to ensure business needs continue to be met.

This is managed through the R&D Division within PHA, and funds essential infrastructure for research such as information databanks, tissue banks, clinical research facilities, clinical trials units and research networks. The element relating to 'Trusts' is allocated throughout the financial year, and the allocation for 'Other Bodies' is used predominantly within universities - both allocations fund agreed projects that enable and support clinical and academic researchers. CHITIN (Cross-border Healthcare Intervention Trials in Ireland Network) is a unique cross-border partnership between the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the Health Research Board in the Republic of Ireland, to develop infrastructure and deliver Healthcare Intervention Trials (HITs). The CHITIN project is funded from the EU's INTERREG VA programme of \u20ac8.84m, and the funding for each financial year from the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) matches expenditure claims, ensuring a breakeven position. Other PHA Capital includes an allocation of \u00a30.141m for the Congenital Heart Disease Professorship Network to be set up across Ireland and \u00a30.8m for a Covid-19 Wastewater project. There is also currently a small allocation of \u00a392k for ICT capital expenditure within PHA, and \u00a3141k for ICT linked to the Contact Tracing Centre.

Apologies were noted from Mr Robert Irvine. 2/22 Item 2 - Declaration of Interests 2/22.1 Mr Stewart asked if anyone had interests to declare relevant to any items on the agenda. No interests were declared. 3/22 Item 3 - Minutes of previous meeting held on 3 December 2021 3/22.1 The minutes of the previous meeting, held on 3 December 2021 were approved as an accurate record of that meeting, subject to minor amendments proposed by Ms McCaig in paragraph 58/21.14. - | Page 2 | - 4/22 Item 4 Matters Arising 4/22.1 4/22.2 4/22.3 4/22.4 4/22.5 4/22.6 56/21.2 Contact Tracing Service Mr Stewart noted that there had been an update from the Chief Executive at the last Board meeting about the status of the Contact Tracing Service and the view of the Department with regard to its future, so this remained a live issue. 56/21.3 Recruitment of Vaccinators Mr Stewart said that he was not satisfied that PHA received the legal opinion he was seeking as to whether the Department had the authorit y to direct PHA to carry out this work, and that this remained an open question. Mr Clayton noted that some actions had been discussed and it would be useful to get an update from the Agency Management Team (AMT), and that this should be taken up with the Chair and Chief Executive. Ms Mann- Kler said that there remains this gap and this would need covered in any update . Mr Stewart agreed and said that his point was there was an assumption that the Department could instruct PHA as it saw fit and its view was that as PHA is responsible for safeguarding public health it was a legitimate request, but he queried whether it is within PHA's statutory remit to hire vaccinators. He added that when the question was sent to Counsel he had made it clear what question he wanted asked, and that question still remained unanswered. Mr Clayton noted that the Chief Executive had subsequently reported to the Board that he had been linking with RQIA regarding registration and he would like to receive an update on how that is progressing. He added that he had had a conversation with the Chair and suggested to him that there should be a discussion about these issues at a workshop in order to reach a resolution. He said that the Chair was going to give consideration to that pr oposal. Mr Stewart said that he was raising this again as the Board needs to be sure that there were legitimate grounds for making the request, and he did not want there to be a gap in PHA's governance. He undertook to speak to the Chair and Chief Execut ive about this (Action 1 - Mr Stewart). Mr Wilson noted that he recalled the discussions at the last Board meeting about the issue of what question should have been put, and he agreed with the suggestion of discussing this in a workshop. Mr Stewart said that he had asked to see the question before it was sent because the response received to any question will depend on the question that is asked. 56/21.6 Closure of HSCB Mr Stewart noted that the HSCB is due to close at the end of March, and - | Page 3 | - 4/22.7 4/22.8 4/22.9 4/22.10 4/22.11 said that the Board and Governance and Audit Committee should be more aware of how that work is progressing given it touches on a range of areas that may impact on PHA, e.g. the finance function. Ms McCaig advised that she has prepared a letter for the Chair and Chief Executive setting out that, from a finance persp ective, there will be no change for PHA until PHA makes a decision regarding a Director of Finance and that the service provided by her staff will continue to be ring fenced. She said that she was holding off until the right time to send this correspondence. Mr Stewart expressed his relief as the date is looming very quickly and he said that he would speak to the Chair about ensuring that the PHA Board is kept fully informed (Action 2 - Mr Stewart). Ms Mann -Kler asked if there is a document which outlines the governance implications of the closure of HSCB on PHA. Ms McCaig explained that although HSCB is closing, it s staff will be hosted by BSO and there will be no change in how PHA receives its services and therefore there is no specific document. She added that there will be an MOU between PHA and BSO, and that although HSCB is closing and being replaced by the Strategic Planning and Performance Group (SPPG), it will be using the same finance system and the same HR system. She reiterated that she will set all of this out in her correspondence. Mr Clayton agreed that it would be useful to get a sense of the wor k and he noted that this is on the Corporate Risk Register where there is reference to the creation of the new integrated care system. He said that he would welcome an update on what impact the closure of HSCB will have on PHA staff. He recalled that last year there was a discussion with Department officials and he felt it would be useful to have a further briefing within the next few months. H e noted that Local Commissioning Groups (LCGs) will remain in place until the new Area Programme Boards are set up so he reiterated that it would be useful to understand the implications of all of this for PHA. Ms McCaig advised that there is a lot of wor k ongoing with regard to the new planning boards and that PHA staff are involved in this. She suggested that the Chair and Chief Executive should write to Ms Martina Moore to invite her to give a br iefing to the Board. She indicated that the end of April may be a good time for this. Mr Stewart agreed that the PHA Board should receive a briefing so it knows where it stands across a range of integrated services. Ms McCaig commented that while many things are changing, many others will remain the same. She suggested that the bigger changes will not take place on 1 April, but further down the line. Mr Stewart said that the PHA Board needs to know what the changes are so that is on the record and to be assured so that even an indication that there is no change represents an assurance. Mr Wilson said that he agreed with what Ms McCaig said and advis ed - | Page 4 | - that he and Mr Murray had met recently with Ms Moore and he had no issue with bringing an update to the PHA Board (Action 3 - Mr Wilson) . 7/22 Item 7 - Corporate Governance 7/22.1 7/22.2 7/22.3 7/22.4 Public Health Directorate Risk Register as at 31 December 2021 [GAC/03 /01/22] Dr Stephen Bergin joined the meeting for this item. Mr Stewart thanked Dr Bergin for joining the meeting to discuss the public health directorate risk register. Dr Bergin recalled his previous Committee attendance and said that many of the issues that were flagged up then remain live as the team has been tasked with other duties. He said that the public health directorate is under staffing pressures and other directorates have stepped in to help. He added that there is need for a rebuild, but that is a strategic issue for the PHA as a whole, and therefore some of the staffing issues may have to be c arried forward until the wider capacity issues in PHA are worked out. He suggested that in the future there may not be a directorate of public health. Mr Stewart asked if not filling posts heightens the risk. He noted the reference in the risk register about apprenticeships and development opportunities and asked if there was any possibility of that work going forward. Dr Bergin said that there are a lot of ideas. He pointed out that in terms of public health qualifications, only 10% of the PHA workfor ce have those but this should be higher. He said that there should be an incentive for staff to develop on a public health career pathway, but that work will take a couple of years. Mr Stewart said that Dr Bergin would have the Committee's support in adv ancing such work as PHA continues to have difficulties in recruiting staff. Ms Mann- Kler asked about the blockages that exist, and whether these are that the PHA is not an attractive place to work, or if there is a global shortage of public health staff a nd if other similar agencies are facing the same challenge. She noted that this problem has existed since before the pandemic. Dr Bergin replied that there should be a pathway for staff development, but he explained that in order for staff to develop they would have to do this outside PHA and there is no incentive to do that. He noted that the process could be more agile but this would go outside Agenda for Change terms and conditions. Mr Stewart said that this is about organisational development as a w hole. Mr Clayton added that getting the workforce trained to have that level of public health knowledge and expertise should be a discussion for the whole Board, but he noted that it is a complex area. Mr Stewart said that issues about the IT systems for screening programmes had been raised previously. He noted that on the Corporate Risk Register, there is a reference to the IT support for - | Page 5 | - 7/22.5 7/22.6 7/22.7 7/22.8 7/22.9 screening programmes indicating that these are legacy systems. He asked whether that will impact on PHA's ability t o mitigate the risk. He noted that there was a risk that by April 2021 the IT system for breast screening would be obsolete, but given that was almost a year ago, he asked whether a mitigation had been put in place. Dr Bergin explained that the computer system will not stop working, but it is the updating of the system that is the issue which has resulted in some processes becoming more manual, therefore there is a need to get a more modern system in place. He added that for those systems that are out of date, the solution is not for PHA to procure its own system, but to link in nationally with the NHS and if a system is developed, Northern Ireland can avail of it. He noted that at present PHA is working with private companies because it does not have th e capacity to do this work. He said that the development of the Vaccine Management System for COVID -19, which will come to PHA, reinforces the need for PHA to get more staff. Mr Stewart asked if there was a possibility of the business case for breast scr eening getting approved in- year given PHA is in a position where it will be returning funding. Dr Bergin advised that there has been in-year funding, but many programmes of work have suffered as a result of COVID -19 and are running behind. He said that P HA is in the queue to get funding next year. Ms McCaig concurred that the budget for next year has not yet been finalised and is awaiting Ministerial approval. She added that any IT requests would go to the digital team at the Department. Ms Mann -Kler a sked that when talking about data intelligence functions, what aspirations does PHA have in terms of the system that it needs, and how can it be future proofed. She noted that it is going to take 12/18 months for programmes to get back on track, and asked how PHA is dealing with the risk in terms of targeting screening for high risk and vulnerable groups. Dr Bergin advised that there will be an update on screening brought to the PHA Board. He said that for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) screening, those at higher risk would have continued to have been screened, but it will take time for the programme to catch up for those at lower risk. Mr Stewart noted the impact of COVID -19 when reading the directorate risk register. He asked whether the risk referri ng to CBRN incidents was rated appropriately and if this was really likely. Dr Bergin explained that as PHA's lens is firmly focused on COVID- 19, there is a risk of other infectious diseases being overlooked. Mr Stewart said that he understood the rationale. Mr Stewart thanked Dr Bergin for attending the meeting and expressed his thanks to Dr Bergin and his staff for their work in getting this directorate risk register updated. Members noted the public health directorate risk register. - | Page 6 | - 4/22 Item 4 - Matters Arising 4/22.12 4/22.13 58/21.4 Workforce Issues Mr Stewart noted that there had been a discussion at the last PHA Board about the need for a workforce plan. 58/21.8 Staff Resilience Mr Stewart noted that this had also been discussed at the last PHA Board meeting. 5/22 Item 5 - Chair's Business 5/22.1 Mr Stewart advised that he had no Chair's Business. 6/22 Item 6 - Internal Audit 6/22.1 6/22.2 6/22.3 6/22.4 Internal Audit Progress Report [GAC/ 01/01/22] Mr Charles advised that a draft report on the audit of Board effectiveness has been shared with the Chair and Chief Executive. He said that there has been an exit meeting and he is hopeful that the report can be finalised by mid- February. In terms of other audits, he reported that the fieldwork is ongoing for the financial review audit with a view to a draft report being issued in the next 7/10 days. He added that a joint HSCB/PHA audit of Serious Adverse Incidents (SAIs) is being carried out and a draft report sh ould be issued in early February. Mr Charles advised that there has been a request to defer the audit on vaccination programmes given the challenges facing the public health directorate, but this would need to be approved by the Committee. Mr Stewart sai d that Mr Wilson had written to him regarding this and he had shared that correspondence with Mr Clayton and Ms Mann- Kler. Members approved the deferral of the audit. Mr Stewart said that he had spoken to Ms McKeown about the SAI audit as the issue of SA Is has concerned Non- Executive members for some time. He added that NEDs have been asking for clarity in terms of where PHA's responsibility lies in this area and he is concerned that there is a gap. He said that reporting on SAIs is listed for \"noting\" on PHA's Assurance Framework and he has spoken to the Chief Executive to express his view that this is not appropriate. Mr Charles asked if the issue is that the Board does not have visibility of the outworking of SAIs. Mr Stewart said that as the Board is unsure as to its responsibilities, it cannot properly oversee the process. He noted that an update had been given to members but he felt that it did not cover the queries raised. Mr Clayton commented that he is not clear in terms of how PHA oversees t his area. He said that part of the - | Page 7 | - 6/22.5 6/22.6 6/22.7 responsibility lies within Mr Rodney Morton's directorate, in a not dissimilar way to other areas of joint working with HSCB. He added that the Board is not totally clear on the process and from a governance perspective, PHA's role may be affected by the closure of HSCB. Mr Charles explained that if an SAI were to occur in a Trust, the Trust has 72 hours to report it to HSCB who then assign a Designated Responsible Officer (DRO) . He said that there are number of groups in HSCB which look at SAIs and which PHA staff are involved in. He added that there are regular reports on SAIs which come through HSCB, but perhaps there is no visibility for PHA NEDs. He said that while there may be clarity on the process at an operat ional level, there is not at NED level. Mr Charles said that the audit work is progressing well, but noted that there has been more time spent on audits than envisaged, particularly the Board effectiveness audit. Members noted the Internal Audit Progress Report. 7/22 Item 7 - Corporate Governance 7/22.10 7/22.11 7/22.12 7/22.13 Corporate Risk Register as at 31 December 2021 [GAC/ 02/01/22] Mr Wilson explained that this version of the Corporate Risk Register represents a review as at 31 December 2021. He advised that two risks have had their rating reduced, one relating to PHA leadership and one relati ng to Lifeline; and two others have been removed, both relating to finance. He said that a new risk has been added which relates to finance and in particular PHA's requirement to achieve a break even position. Ms Mann -Kler said that it was useful to get the Corporate Risk Register to the Committee in a timely way. She asked what action is being proposed to deal with the risk on cyber security (risk 39). Mr Wilson advised that BSO lead on this area on a regional basis. He said that the recent incidents at Queen's University and in the HSE in the Republic of Ireland have opened up some complexities. He added that this is an area that is expanding and PHA will work with BSO and HSC to understand the gaps. Ms Braithwaite advised that on the back of the incident at Queen's, a lot of work was carried out to bring HSC systems and processes up to date, and there was a proposal to carry out a piece of work across Northern Ireland on cyber security but when an update on this work was asked about at a meeting thi s morning, the response was that at present the Department does not have the capacity to take this forward and that no progress is expected this year. Mr Stewart asked about risk 52, which relates to information - | Page 8 | - 7/22.14 7/22.15 7/22.16 7/22.17 governance, and noted that the review date had changed to March 2022 for all staff in contact tracing to complete information governance training prior to deployment as it was his understanding that all staff are trained before they commence duties. Mr Wilson assured members that contact tracing s taff are not deployed until they have done their training. Moving onto risk 54, regarding the the ability of third party providers to deliver commissioned services, Mr Stewart noted that 96% of providers are delivering services fully or with reasonable adjustment, and therefore he did not feel that this represented a risk. Mr Wilson reported that he had raised this with staff in Health Improvement and it was felt that this risk should be kept as \"medium\" because there remain some issues with contract management and there are also issues in terms of the extent to which staff can pick these up as they have been redeployed to support contact tracing. He said that he envisaged this risk having a lower risk when it is next reviewed. Returning to risk 52, Mr C layton noted that there was reference to arrangements with the new UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) being finalised and he asked what this related to. From a cyber security point of view, he asked if there were risks to data sharing and if the agreements are being put in place because UKHSA is a new body, or because there are risks. Ms Braithwaite said that there is a lot of change at the moment and PHA is being careful it is not sharing information simply because it is being asked to. She said that PHA had shared data related to genome sequencing, but it is now being careful with regard to other requests . Mr Clayton said that he asked this because there was a discussion about an MOU between UKHSA and other nations and therefore he had this concern that PHA wasn't sharing information because it was being asked for. Mr Stewart noted that in risk 62 relating to regional vaccinators, two of the gaps concerned not having a formal letter and not having confirmed funding, but his understanding was that these were in place. Mr Wilson agreed and said that this needs to be updated. Mr Clayton said that a previous meeting, there was discussion about the removal of a risk relating to contact tracing and he queried whether this should be placed back on the regis ter given the current number of daily cases and given the impact it is having on other aspects of PHA's business. He noted that previously an element of the risk was about funding, but perhaps on this occasion it is about resilience and PHA's ability to c ope. He felt it may be worth considering as it may take months for the number of daily cases to decline. He added that there was also discussion about AMT considering combining the risks about workforce into one risk rather than having separate for publi c health and HSCQI which could be placed on the appropriate directorate risk registers. He also asked why the rating for risk 63 relating to Lifeline has been reduced. - | Page 9 | - 7/22.18 7/22.19 7/22.20 Mr Wilson said that in terms of contact tracing, this is kept under review on a daily basis and there are currently discussions about what will happen to contact tracing after the end of June. He suggested that there is potential for a digital solution. He expressed his surprise about the situation in England whereby many elements of the pandemic are starting to be scaled down e.g. testing and contact tracing. He said that this is being kept under review by AMT. Mr Clayton suggested that there may be a broader risk in terms of PHA's future COVID -19 response. He noted that at the last Board meeting, Dr Bergin had talked about a central contact tracing hub for COVID -19 and other infectious diseases. Mr Wilson pointed out that PHA has always had a contact tracing element to its work. Mr Wilson advised that there are discussions taking place about staffing pressures and that on the next iteration of the Register, the two risks relating to workforce will be combined. In terms of the risk on Lifeline, he was not certain what had changed, but he suggested that it related to the contract that is in place with the service provider. He undertook to come back to the Committee with more detail (Action 4 - Mr Wilson) . Members APPROVED the Corporate Risk Register. 8/22 Item 8 - External Audit - PHA Audit Strategy 2021 -22 [GAC/04/01/22] 8/22.1 8/22.2 8/22.3 8/22.4 Mr McCance said that the Committee will be familiar with the content of the Audit Strategy which outlines how the audit will be completed and the proposed timeline. He advised that while the Comptroller and Auditor General signs off the audit, the work is sub-contracted to ASM. Ms Hagan took members through the Strategy beginning with the key messages outlining the purpose of the document and advising that the level of materiality has been set at \u00a31.86m. She highlighted the significant audit risks and then the actions required for the Committee. Returning to the level of materiality, she advised that any misstatements above \u00a393k will be reported to the Committee. Ms Hagan moved onto the next section which outlines the audit approach. She highlighted t he changes in the financial reporting guidance in that IFRS 16 will come into effect so PHA may be required to make some transactional disclosures. Ms Hagan gave more detail on the two significant risks, namely management override of controls and risk of fraud in revenue recognition. She advised that there are two other risk factors which will be monitored during the audit, the first of which is the requirement to break even. She noted that given the impact of COVID -19 on spend profiles, there may be manipulation of data in order to achieve a break even position. She added that there will also be a focus on accruals and holiday pay. She said that the second risk relates to fund ing and Direct - | Page 10 | - 8/22.5 8/22.6 8/22.7 8/22.8 8/22.9 Award Contracts and ensuring that these were not applied retrospectively due to COVID -19 pressures. At this point Ms Braithwaite left the meeting. Ms Hagan outlined the proposed timetable for the audit and the makeup of the audit team. She advised that there were three appendices to the Strategy, including some public reports which may be of interest to members. She said that the final appendix indicated that there are no prior concerns being brought forward to this audit. Mr Stewart asked whether the Committee was content that the assessment of risks is adequate and members said they were content. Ms McCaig advised that she has had a meeting with Ms Hagan and there are no other matters to be raised. She referred to the Grant Fraud Risks publication and that while PHA does not award grants in that way, there was some good practice in the document that Ms Lyn Benson will review and bring through into PHA's practice. Ms Mann -Kler asked how the public reports could be obtained. Mr McCance advised that all of the reports are published on the NIAO website and that he had previously brought two of the reports, those relating to addition services and workforce planning, to the Committee. He said that he was happy to bring future reports t o the Committee's attention and give a presentation if requested. Members noted the PHA Audit Strategy 2021/22. 9/22 Item 9 - Finance 9/22.1 9/22.2 9/22.3 Updated Anti -Fraud and Anti -Bribery Policy and Response Plan [GAC/05/01/22] Ms McCaig said that regular reviews of policies are carried out and that Ms Benson has worked with regional colleagues to bring this policy up to date and ensure that it complies with current good practice. Ms McCaig advised that the policy begins by defining fraud and bribery and some key areas to be mindful of. She said that PHA has a zero tolerance approach to fraud so takes seriously any matters that are brought to its attention. She added that the policy also outlines the disciplinary process that may need t o be followed. Ms McCaig said that staff are encouraged to report suspected fraud or bribery and raise their concerns, and these concerns will be investigated. She advised that PHA has not had a lot of cases but will continue to promote awareness. She s aid that if the policy is approved a communication will issue to staff drawing it to their attention and reiterating that if staff have concerns, they should raise them, and they - | Page 11 | - 9/22.4 9/22.5 9/22.6 9/22.7 9/22.8 will be supported. She advised that an equality screening has been conducted and is included with the policy. Mr Stewart asked why staff are asked not to contact the PSNI, and how this policy links with the Whistleblowing Policy. Ms McCaig advised that previously there have been matters which have been reported to the PSNI and H SCB/PHA has not been made aware so it is about ensuring that the policy is correctly followed. She assured members that the Counter Fraud and Probity Unit will link with the PSNI if appropriate. She said that whistleblowing is a process which may ultimat ely lead to a fraud investigation so it is about ensuring that matters are dealt with in the right way and that there is no cross over. Mr Clayton said that he hadn't picked up on the issue of staff contacting the PSNI directly and suggested that the reas ons for not doing so should be explained. In relation to the link with the whistleblowing policy, he accepted that they are two separate policies, but a member of staff may go to someone to raise a whistleblowing issue that relates to fraud so it may be useful to point out the distinction between the two. Ms McCaig said that she is always mindful about saying that the policies are completely connected, but it is important not to put staff off from raising concerns. She said that the policies may be linked in some matters, but not in others and it's important not to draw conclusions. She added that the outworking of each policy will determine which one is more appropriate. Mr Stewart felt that the instruction for staff not to contact the PSNI needs to be moderated. He also suggested that there should be a box in the flow chart diagram referring to whistleblowing. Ms McCaig said that she would wish to give that further consideration as whistleblowing does not necessarily mean fraud and she was concerned about the message that this conveys. She reiterated that she did not wish to put people off raising issues. Ms Mann -Kler said that it was her view that the policies should be separate as she concurred with Ms McCaig's view that it could prevent people fr om coming forward. She asked if there was any good practice in the system, and how other organisations promote this. Ms McCaig said that the policies would be separate. On balance, she suggested that by connecting them formally it gives people a directi on, but people need to consider each policy on its own merit. Mr Clayton said that he understood the points being made, but one the reasons he raised it is because in the whistleblowing policy, there is an assurance about staff being protected, and he did not know if that language applied in these policies. He suggested that this could be highlighted in any training. Ms McCaig advised that part of the policy is about supporting individuals. She added that policies are developed in order to prevent these incidents happening and are designed to be supportive. She sa id that staff can also pass information to Counter - | Page 12 | - 9/22.9 9/22.10 9/22.11 9/22.12 9/22.13 9/22.14 9/22.15 Fraud and Probity anonymously. Mr Stewart said that he was happy to approve the policies subject to an amendment around the narrative about contacting PSNI. Subject to amendment, members APPROVED the Anti-Fraud and Anti - Bribery Policy and Response Plan. Fraud Liaison Officer Report [GAC/06/01/22] Ms McCaig advised that there were two matters that she wished to bring to the Committee's attention. However, she noted that in both cases there has been n o suspected actual fraud found following preliminary investigations. Ms McCaig said that the first case related to an organisation which provides services in relation to substance misuse. She advised that some irregularities in reporting on a particular project had been reported to the Department of Health by another Department and given that the organisation has a range of contracts with HSC bodies, a process was established to review each contract and the latest performance management information. She added that an assessment had to made about stopping payments. She reported that each service provider has received a phone call and face to face meetings with a sample of providers will take place over the next week. Ms McCaig advised that there are no i ndications that PHA is not receiving the services it has commissioned. She clarified that there has not been a PSNI investigation and at this point there is no indication that this matter needs to be taken to the next stage and that this is the case for all HSC bodies with one exception, where an irregularity in reporting was picked up. Ms McCaig reported that there is a regional review being chaired by the Director of Finance in the Department of Health and that all contract managers and fraud liaison of ficers have been asked to determine if this matter needs taken to the next stage. She reiterated that to date, she has not seen anything that would merit this. She advised that she is required to send an assurance to the Department, which she will undert ake following completion of the face to face meetings. Ms Mann -Kler asked whether the action taken was proportionate in this case. Ms McCaig said that a meeting in December with Directors of Finance there was a request to suspend payments, but it was poi nted out that this would put HSC bodies in breach of contract so there was an agreement that each organisation would carry out its own due diligence. She added that she has almost completed her assurance, and to date there are no concerns, but if that sit uation changes she would update the PHA Board. Mr Murray agreed that PHA was happy with the services it was receiving and felt that there had been over reporting of - | Page 13 | - 9/22.16 9/22.17 9/22.18 9/22.19 the matter. Ms McCaig said that there are lessons to be learnt, and added that PHA has re ceived a lot of information, has had telephone conversations with provider s and will be following up with visits. Mr Clayton thanked Ms McCaig for the update and asked whether the sample of services reflects the diverse nature of the work that this organi sation does for PHA. He also asked about the timeline for this work. Ms McCaig replied that the work should be completed in the next week, and that she chose the sample ensuring that there was a range of services in different areas so there were different contract managers and it was not the same staff going out and doing the visits. Mr Clayton said that this was a sensible approach. With regard to the suggested PSNI investigation, he asked where PHA got the information that there wasn't an investigation. Ms McCaig thought that this information had come from a press release but she undertook to check this (Action 5 - Ms McCaig) . Mr Clayton said that the conjecture did not help, but Ms McCaig said that it would not have changed PHA's approach. She added that PHA will continue to work with the evidence it has and if there is no evidence of fraud, the matter will not go any further. Mr Murray said that he hoped that the investigations would be complete d by the end of next week and reported back to Ms McCaig as soon as possible in order to draw a line under this matter. Ms McCaig advised that the second matter was a situation wher e the PHA was contacted by the Chief Executive of a third party to advise that a review of financial accounting and governance was being initiated at the request of another funder. She added that on 12 January a draft report was received which indicated t hat there may be irregularities and so a meeting was held with joint funders on 18 January to plan further actions. She said that the Fraud Liaison Officer provided a report to BSO Counter Fraud. She noted that this is a difficult one as there are many different organisations involved, but she agreed to keep the Committee informed. Ms McCaig said that the rest of the Report gives an update on the fraud action plan for the year. She advised that the data matching exercise has been completed and there wer e no suspected fraud issues. Mr Stewart asked about the financial value of the 117 high risk matches relating to duplicate records. Ms McCaig suggested that the issue may not be in relation to the payment but she agreed to get some further information on this (Action 6 - Ms McCaig) . She explained that the Shared Services centre has monthly processes in place so any issues of overpayment would be picked up in the monthly reports. 10/22 Item 10 - Any Other Business 10/22.1 With there being no other business, Mr Stewart thanked members for their time and drew the meeting to a close. - | Page 14 | - 11/22 Item 11 - Details of Next Meeting Monday 11 April 2022 at 10am Fifth Floor Meeting Room (or via Zoom). 12/22 Linenhall Street, Belfast, BT2 8BS Signed by Chair: Joseph Stewart Date: 11 April 2022 item 11 Title of Meeting PHA Board Meeting Date 19 May 2022 Title of paper PHA Business Plan 2022/23 Reference PHA/0 3/05/22 Prepared by Stephen Murray Lead Director Stephen Wilson Recommendation For Approval For Noting 1 Purpose The purpose of this paper is to seek approval of PHA's Business Plan for 2022/23. 2 Background Information Since March 2022, work has been on- going to develop the PHA Annual Business Plan (ABP) for 2022/23. Following engagement with PHA B oard members it was agreed that the ABP should be focused on a smaller number of high priority actions that will represent the key corporate issues that PHA needs to specifically make progress on over the coming 12 month period. 3 Key Issues The ABP sets out the 9 key corporate actions that PHA Board will primarily focus on progressing in 2022/23, broken down across the following 5 Thematic areas; Managing Covid 19 response Protecting our Population's Health Improving Health and Social Wellbei ng and reducing health inequalities Shaping future health Our Organisation Works Effectively In support of the ABP a separate Action Plan is currently being finalised that will set out the specific areas of work that PHA will take forward during 2022/23 to progress a number of important Ministerial / DoH policy priorities as well as continue to progress the many strategic priorities that underpin the on- going delivery of the PHA Corporate Plan. The actions set out in the ABP and the more detailed PHA Actio n Plan will cascade down into the development of respective Directorate Business plans to ensure delivery at a Directorate operational level. 4 Next Steps Following approval, the Board will receive quarterly Performance Management Report updates against the Business Plan. 1 PHA Annual Business Plan 2022/23 2 Introduction The Public Health Agency (PHA) Annual Business Plan sets out the key strategic actions that will be taken forward by PHA during 2022/23. The Annual Business Plan does not set out all of the specific areas of work that are being progressed by the Agency on an on- going basis in meeting both the wide range of Ministerial pri orities and outcomes set out in the PHA Corporate Plan. Rather it identifies those key areas of work that the Agency recognises require particular attention at this time to enable strategic progress to be achieved both during 22/23 and in future years. The plan is broken down under the following Thematic areas: Managing Covid 19 response Protecting our Population' s Health Improving Health and Social Wellbeing and reducing health inequalities Shaping future health Our Organisation Works Effectively During 2022/23, the Agency can be expected to continue to focus a significant element of its resources on addressing the on -going COVID -19 pandemic and ensure that key interventions to contain and manage the virus, such as further roll out of the vaccinati on programme, targeted Covid 19 testing and contac t tracing, surveillance and public behaviour messaging are deployed in a proportionate and effective way. Whilst the Agency will continue to prioritise all actions necessary to effectively manage the COVI D-19 pandemic, it is important that in 2022/23, the PHA also focuses as much as possible on returning to 'business as usual' and addressing its wider corporate priorities such as addressing health inequalities which have been further exacerbated during the Pandemic. Significantly, 2022/23 will see several strategic changes within the planning and delivery of Health and Social Care across Northern Ireland. From April 2022 the Health and Social Care Board will be replaced by a new Strategic Performance Planning Group (SPPG) under the direction of the DoH. New arrangements for the planning and commissioning of services will be stood up during the course of the year as a new Area Based Integrated Planning system is rolled out. The Agency will be required to engage fully to ensure we successfully optimise the potential for Population Health outcomes to be realised in partnership with the wider HSC and other key bodies. At the same ti me there is also a need to plan how the Agency as the strategic lead for Public Health in Northern Ireland needs to change, taking on board the learning from the pandemic response to date and developments across health and social care and wider society, so that we ensure we have the appropriate skills, knowledge and expertise to best address the significant public health challenges facing Northern Ireland both now and in the future. 3 The Action Plan attached as appendix 1 to the ABP contains more detailed information on the wide range of actions that will be progressed by the PHA in 2022/23 in meeting the on- going Mini sterial and Corporate Plan priorities. Accountability The Annual Business plan will be monitored quarterly and update reports provided to PHA Board. AMT will be collectively responsible for ensuring the actions and associated KPIs are achieved. Where actions are not on target to deliver these will be considered by AMT and mitigating actions agreed to ensure maximum progress is made by March 2023. 4 2022/23 Key Priorities Key Priorities Strategic Theme Action programme Measurable Key performance Indicators 1 Managing Covid 19 response.

This will include the Development of New Managed Care IPC Network. New IPC Resource Framework, and development of professional guidance in the modelling and use of PPE Operationalise the updated Infection Protection and Control (IPC) infrastructure including anti - microbial resistance stewardship We are in the final stages of developing the Regional IPC Framework which has been shared with the Regional IPC Cell and colleagues in Health Protection (PHA) for consultation before submission to the DoH for consideration. We are in the process of Recruiting Nursing Assistant Director and Nurse Consultant for IPC and this will strengthen the PHA Directorate of Nursing IPC response. Following the submission of the Regional IPC Framework a Regional Managed Care IPC Network will be developed and will replace the current Regional IPC Cell. The Managed Care Netw ork will be multidisciplinary and will provide an opportunity to promote consistency, standardisation and shared learning. Northern Ireland currently follows the UK Health Security Agency (formally PHE) national guidance which outlines the PPE requiremen ts in various settings. BSO are engaged in forecasting PPE based on historical usage and volume data, through the last 3 surges. In relation to modelling, it has been agreed that it is no longer required to scientifically correlate other factors and theref ore modelling PPE has been stood down. The IPC infrastructure will be operationalised when the DoH have approved the Regional IPC Framework and following development of the IPC Managed Care Network. R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs The Regional IPC Framework to be finalised and submitted to DoH for agreement and approval as soon as possible . Further discussions with Trusts and Health Protection colleagues are required. 4 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan : Progress Achiev ability (RAG) Oct Jan Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 14 Continue to progress quality improvement work linked to Cov id learning / recovery Regional Learning System On 24th April 2020 Trust CEOs asked the HSCQI Network to provide support to Trusts and to the wider system in order to develop a regional learning system focused on lessons learned from COVID -19 to date. Harvesting of examples during a 90 day cycle resulted in regional agreement to focus the collective improvement effort on 3 key themes : virtual visiting, virtual consultations and staff psychological wellbeing . This work was supported in partnership with the ECHO team. Following discussion with strategic leaders, HSCQI carried out a literature review to identify a robust framework for scale and spread (diagram 10 appen dix 1.14). This has now been endorsed by the HSCQI QI Leads and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. The HSCQI Leadership Alliance meeting on 11th November 2021 was chaired by a newly appointed Chair. The theme of \"Timely Access\" was agreed by the Alliance as a regional priority for the HSCQI Network going forward. The HSCQI Covid -19 Learnin g System work has been impacted by reduced capacity in the HSCQI Hub, ie, one WTE resigned in December and redeployment of 1 WTE to contact tracing in December 2021. Dr A. Keaney , Director HSCQI The Hub Team are currently engaging in a series of discu ssions with regional leaders to identify priority areas of focus. Linking with HR to recruit to vacant funded posts and linking with AMT to identify funding for additional temporary posts. 5 2. Health Protection Action from Business Plan : Progress Achie vability (RAG) Oct Jan Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 1 Drive increased uptake of childhood and adult preventable disease vaccines, through targeting low uptake groups. Pregnancy vaccines The HP consultant lead for pregnancy vaccines has prioritised delivery of COVID vaccine in pregnancy. Vaccine coverage has been established via NIMATS and through the analytics platform system. Progressing linkage of VMS and NIMATS data . Uptake as of end of January at deliver y - 61% of women delivering in January had a least one dose of vaccine (+5% from previous month), with 56% having had two vaccines (+6%) across NI. Increases observed across Trusts on previous month with variation between Trusts narrowing (62% SET vs 55% ST) Under 30 remains lowest age group, however coverage increasing - at least 1 dose now 50% (+5%). Booster and third doses not included this month - very small numbers from NIMATS, data field only added 20th December - we will review possible inclusion i n next report. Interventions - promotion materials, letter to pregnant women via Trusts, working with Trusts to establish vaccine clinics through maternity services, audio recorded midwife training slides add to website. Other children's vaccines Since prior to pandemic, preschool vaccines were falling in a small but persistent way, similar to England, especially in 12mt S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) Developments are taking place to improve childhood vaccine uptake monitoring through the analytics platform, which will also enable a quantitative study to identify causes of low uptake in preschool children . Engagement with GPs, health visitors and school nurses responsible for childhood vaccine delivery will take place following completion of COVID booster programme delivered through GP 6 2. Health Protection Action from Business Plan : Progress Achie vability (RAG) Oct Jan Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red and 24mt age groups, and is now appearing to plateau at a lower level. It is too early to see the impact of the pandemic on uptake but early indications suggest that there has not been further decline. Further analysis to assess falling uptake is being carried out to identify causes of low uptake in preschool children. Trusts child health teams are aware and have been following up. 7 3. Health Improvement Action from Business Plan : Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 12 In line with the Nursing and Midwifery Task Group set up the infrastructure to develop a New Nursing and Public Health Nursing & Midwifery F ramework Within the \u00a320m Delivering Care Investment for 21/22, in line with the NMTG, the PHA is leading on the development and establishment of a new Public Health and Population Health Nursing Network. These new roles will work with Public Health Consu ltants and other Public Health and Social Care Roles to ensure that prevention, early intervention and recovery are at the heart of all nursing and midwifery practices. It is also anticipated these roles will support the nursing and midwifery contribution to the development and implementation of the new NI Population Health Planning model, and will be expected to support the development of population health planning across ICS's. Trusts are making progress on recruiting their public health nurse consultan ts and we expected all post to be appointment by March 22. A number of regional Nurse Consultant posts are currently being progressed. R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs The Associate Director for Public Health Nursing Post has been Job Matched and is awating DOH Approval. The work on developing a Nursing and Midwifery Public Health Nursing Framework has been delayed due the Pandemic, However the DON has now established a plan to progress theme 1 of the NMTG which is expected to now deli ver by December 2022. 14 Develop A Public Health Model For Homeless Services and develop a business case for the expansion of homeless health care hubs. The Homeless Inclusion service has now been extended to each Trust area. The Belfast Inclusion Hub will offer support to other Homeless Hub Nurses. The Homeless Inclusion teams have played an important role in Covid support to the Homeless Sector. Whilst additional investment has now gone to each Trust to support the development of their Homeless health care services further needs assessment work is required in 22/23 ahead of a new business case for further expansion of these serv ices.

Health Protection has also secured staff for the contact tracing service via an HSCNI workforce appea l and HSCNI recruitment service. Clinicians have also been secured via local recruitment agencies to support the contact tracing service, acute response service, care home teams and the PHA education cell. Recruitment is currently underway to enhance the Health Protection service. The Director of Public Health office/function (to address COVID) has been enhanced through the appointment of a deputy Director of Public Health The Health Protection service and contact tracing service have been supported by other PHA Directorates during the Covid -19 pandemic, most recently for the Omicron wave.

Performance of the CTS has mostly been in line with agreed indicators for the year. However, the arrival of the omicron variant and the unprecedented increase in case numbers inevitably affected performance during late quarter 3 and into early quarter 4. In response, an enhanced escalation plan was agreed with DoH which was based on a much reduced call script to reduce cal l handling time and an increased reliance on digital self - trace. PHA staff were again temporarily redeployed to the Service to increase capacity during this period . In late February 22, the CTS moved out of high escalation, continuing to work on a reduce d tracing script that prioritised positive PCR tests and under 18 LFTs with calls made to other LFT cases where resource allowed. In light of reduced case volumes and improved performance the CTS continued to de - escalate during March with a reduced relian ce on additional and bank hours from both its band 6 and band 4 tracing staff.

Procedures are in place for monitoring variants of concern through genotyping and Whole genome sequencing of samples from HSC laboratories and the national testing programs. Current capacity for 1000 whole genome sequencing tests per week for surveillance purposes however reducing community prevalence will dictate if this is feasible. Lateral flow use continues to be f ully utilised as a first testing option with a reduction in PCR testing need and capacity. Various reports on testing are completed and shared as appropriate / available on request to include monthly care home reports, asymptomatic HCW staff testing LFD. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 4 Strengthen PHA capacity to provide the intelligence needed to meet organisational goals by supporting staff to Progress has been made on this objective with further activity planned in the short term.

The school based childrens programme and health and social care programme is now complete. The overall programme will formally finish end of March 2022 The PHA is responsible for delivering flu vaccine uptake monitoring. In pre vious years monitoring was carried out using HSCB GP claim returns and auto -extraction of limited data from GP clinical systems. This year, however, a new regional Vaccine Management System (VMS) has been introduced to record COVID and flu vaccines. To da te, there are issues with GP use of VMS for seasonal influenza with incomplete use of the system and difficulties recording data in a timely way (due to lack of admin support within practices): this is currently being addressed. There is a risk therefore t hat uptake may be reported as artificially lower than the true uptake, until the VMS is fully utilised by GPs. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 22 1.

PHA currently employs 594 staff with a whole time equivalent of 504.03 This includes a temporary headcount of 247 (173 WTE) to support the pandemic response. Sickness absence was 2.5 6% (cumulative) at the end of the period comparing to 2.39% for the previous year. All Directors 4 Scope out accommodation requirements to allow staff to return to work safely in line with Covid 19 guidelines and work with BSO colleagues to develop appropriate policies and procedures to facilitate new working arrangements The PHA worked with BSO colleagues to ensure that safety inspections were completed in all offices and that appropriate measures were in place for staff safety during the pandemic. Policies and procedures for new working arrangements are being developed regionally and the PHA will implement these when they are published. A \"Report on a Review of the Accommodation Needs for the Public Health Agency\" has been completed and a number of recommendations were made. Implementation of these recommendations has been delayed due to the prioritisation of the covid response, but Terms of Reference have been drafted for an Accommodation Project Board to take these forward. The process of implemen ting some of the recommendations from the Review will integrate very closely with implementation of the S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) 57 5.

Although the COVID response has delayed progress, work is underway to develop an outcomes based performance management and reporting system across PHA. OBA style reporting is in place a lready or is currently developing across a number of work areas and work continues to build organisational capacity. Work had started in 2019/20 to refocus business planning and performance management reporting around an outcomes based approach and a revi ew of corporate performance documents is also now taking place to build on and progress this work. OBA style working is at the core of the the annual business plan 2022/23 and a draft performance framework with a focus on outcomes and impact is in developm ent. Corporately, we have developed and agreed our strategic alignment across key strategic documents and illustrated this using the golden thread. A draft strategic outcomes framework is also underway for use within the outcomes based performance framewo rk. AMT approved the development of a strategic planning team for mental health in July 2021 which has since met and is working to agree an 3 -5yr outcomes framework. This group will act as a prototype for future teams and work has begun to identify key thematic areas that would find the SPT model effective. S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) 58 5.

As well as implementing OBA style reporting to build capacity and knowledge, the focus this year so far has been on promot ing the 'golden thread' illustration of PHA's strategic alignment and the outcomes across a number of strategies that PHA contribute to. As well as providing support to new areas implementing OBA. A focus on impact and OBA style working is at the core of the annual business plan 2022/23 and targeted work has begun with smaller teams in PHA to implement OBA approaches. Work is underway to arrange a series of in -houseOBA awareness sessions for all staff in 2022. S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim ) 7 Meet DoH financial, budget and reporting requirements.

Tracey McCaig 59 Appendix 1.2 - Summary of KPIs for Contact Tracing Service. 60 61 62 63 Appendix 1.8 Screening Programmes - Current Position All screening programmes impacted by Covid continue to build capacity and reduce delays for screening invites. The current po sition ac ross each programme is below: Bowel cancer screening: The delay in rou tine invitations is currently 16 weeks (reduced from 29 weeks). The catch up exercise will be completed by Autumn 2022. No of individuals with a completed screening test result 21/22 activity as a % of 19/20 activity 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 4 (Jan - Mar) 20,153 33,773 168% *note the type of screening test used in the programme changed from January 2021.The above numbers can reflect invites/test k its that were sent out several months prior. Breast screening: The round length is currently 36 months + 5 weeks . This is down from 41 months in September 2020 (although it remains above the standard of 36 months). This is being achieved through the provision of additional screening clin ics. Progress will not be linear as it is dependent upon the continued availability of staff. September 2019 to February 2020 September 2021 to February 2022 21/22 activity as a % of 19/20 activity No of women invited 43594 50937 117% No women (72% uptake) 131% Cervical screening: The programme continues to operate with a 5 month delay in routine invitations with a formal catch up programme not likely to be feasible. Ongoing pressures are noted in relation to tu rnaround times for lab results and some colposcopy services. The number of screening samples received by the labs provides an indication of activity for women being screened. This figure is dependent on the number of w omen due for screening at a given time , the availability of appointments at GP practices, and the uptake by women, so it is subject to fluctuation. Number of cervical samples taken (as recorded received at a NI laboratory) 21/22 samples taken as a % of 19/20 samples 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 4 (Jan-March) 27,621 31,348 113% 65 Diabetic eye screening: The programme continues to use a risk stratified approach to invite individuals for screening. Additional in year funding was secured via the June monitoring review to support recove ry, and further expansion of capacity is being taken forward with the Trust to move towards reintroducing routine screening. This programme has faced significant logistical challenges due to the impact of covid. As well as a reduce d patient throughput requ ired for infection control purposes, programme has had to develop a new model of service delivery. No. of people screened 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity 2019/20 2021/22 ce scanning for men with small/medium AAA is opera ting as normal.

During weekly meetings with QI Leads (May and June 2020) HSCQI members from across the system explored the core components of a learning system, depicted in Diagram 1(Amar Shah, Chief Quality Officer at East London Foundatio n Trust). This diagram has been used to assess the readiness of HSCQI as a regional learning system. Diagram 1: Core components of a learning system. Diagram Credit: Amar Shah, ELFT 2019 Using the structure of a 90 day learning cycle the HSCQI Network continued with these weekly meetings. A number of regional workshops were designed to identify a wide range of learning. Attendance at each of the meetings and workshops and the diversity of attendees is shown below in Diagram 2. Harves ting of examples during the 90 day cycle resulted in regional agreement to focus the collective improvement effort on 3 key areas: virtual visiting, virtual consultations and staff psychological wellbeing. QI Science Literature Mandate - HSCQI Leadership Allia nce HSCQI hub and spoke HSCQI Leadership Alliance Other stakeholders Local and regional data - Quantitative & Qualitative HSCQI ECHO Structured learning sets Life QI 67 Work streams for each of these 3 themes were established with representation from across the HSCQI network. To support this work the HSCQI Hub partnered with the Regional ECHO team to co -deliver monthly HSCQI learning sessions. Diagram 3 shows attendance numbers at each of the 7 sessions held b etween November 2020 and June 2021. The ECHO/HSCQI learning sessions were paused early June due to PHA Covid -19 pressures. Virtual Visiting: The scale and spread of virtual visiting across Trusts during 2020/21 during the COVID 19 pan demic has been a real success story, accelerated by the focus of HSCQI and of the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. Quality Improvement Teams from across the region engaged with HSCQI and collected data on activity as displayed below looking at the number of pa rticipating wards and uptake of virtual visiting slots. These QI teams used run and SPC charts Diagram 2: Attendance at HSCQI Network meetings/workshops Diagram 3 : ECHO session attendance 68 to tell the story and show their tests of change. Examples of QI data collected from one of these teams shown in the appendix - diagrams 4 and 5. In addition to this quantitative data, QI teams also asked service users, families and staff for feedback to inform change and service development. To explore the regional picture, HSCQI partnered with the Regional Care Opinion Team to get regional feedback. This feedback is shown in diagrams 6 and 7. Following agreement with the HSCQI Leadership Alliance in June 2021, responsibility for sustaining virtual visiting now sits locally with Trusts, with regular \"check -ins\" from the HSCQI Hub to ensure sustainability. Staff psychological wellbeing: A number of examples of initiatives to support staff psychological wellbeing during the first wave of Covid -19 were harvested. Given the scope of this work, this workstram connected with other reg ional groups, for example colleagues in the Public Health Agency Staff Wellbeing group and with the DoH Regional Staff Health and Wellbeing group. Work has been progressed through all of these groups to develop a regional infographic and animation to promo te the 'Bridge to Recovery' message for staff - diagram 8. Diagram 4 Diagram 5 Diagram 6 Diagram 7 Diagram 8 69 Virtual Consultations All Trusts have made progress in this area with many developing local guidance. Through the HSCQI Learning System sub group many are beginning to focus on data and measures to demonstrate the effectiveness or \"quality\" of Virtual Consultations. Measures being progressed through the virtual consultations work stream include: 1. Patient or service user feedback 2. Staff Feedback 3. The number of virtual consultations offered and the number of consultations that actually took place. Diagram 9 shows regional virtual activity between January and June 2021. Framework for scale up: In order to support regional scale and spread within these learning themes, HS CQI carried out a literature review to identify a robust framework for scale and spread. A proposed framework has been discussed with QI Leads and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. If endorsed, this regional scale up framework will become an integral part of HSCQI Learning System going forward.

Dr Stephen Bergin had previously agreed to bring an update on screening programmes to a future PHA Board meeting. 2 Key Issues This paper sets out the impact that the Covid- 19 pandemic has had on the population screening programmes and provides an update on where they now are in the recovery process. It also describes some of the ongoing work being led by the screening team in the PHA and horizon scanning of potential important changes and developments in this area. Page 1 of 7 Population Screening P rogrammes : An U pdate to PHA Board May 2022 1. Background 1.1. The PHA is the lead organisation for commissioning and quality assur ing the population screening programmes in Northern Ireland. Screening policy is approved by the Minister, based on the recommendations of the UK National Screening Comm ittee and informed by a Northern Ireland Screening Committee chaired by the Chief Medical Officer. 1.2. There are currently five young person and adult screening programmes and three antenatal and newborn programmes. Cancer screening programmes Non-cancer young person and adult screening programmes Antenatal and newborn screening programmes Bowel Abdominal aortic aneurysm Infectious disease s in pregnancy Breast Diabetic eye Newborn blood spot Cervical Newborn hearing In addition, t here is a very high risk breast cancer screening surveillance programme aimed at women who meet agreed risk criteria. 1.3 Within the PHA, the work on screening programmes is led by a small te am, comprising consultants, programme managers, information support and administrative staff. 1.4 This paper set s out the impact that the Covid- 19 pandemic had on the screening programmes and where they now are in the recovery process. It also describes s ome of the ongoing work being led by the screening team in the PHA and horizon scanning of potential changes and developments in this area. 2 Impact of Covid- 19 2.1 A number of the p opulation screening programmes were paused from mid - Marc h 2020 in response to the COVID -19 pandemi c. The purpose of pausing programmes was to: Page 2 of 7 reduce the risk of COVID -19 infection in the population groups eligible for these screening programmes; reduce the risk of COVID -19 infection in screening staff; and ensure adequate healthcare and laboratory resources could be redirected to the pandemic response. The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), bowel cancer , breast cancer , cervical and diabetic eye (DESP) screening programmes were paused during this period. 2.2 The antenatal and newborn programmes along with the higher risk breast cancer s creening surveillance programme, were considered time critical and were not paused. Screening for diabetic eye disease also continued for pregnant women. 3 Restoration and recovery 3.1 All programmes recommenced activity in summer/autumn 2020. As each programme is delivered in a different way, and requires a different type of screening test, they have had individual challenges which have dictated the pace of the recovery . Issues which have had to be taken into account include: Screening programmes normally operate on the ability to process large numbers of people to filter out those who are at risk of disease. Ongoing social distancing and infection control requirements have impacted on t he throughput of patients at clinics. Staff who perform screening tests are often highly skilled, so there is a limited trained workforce to undertake these tasks and facilitate expanded capacity on a short term basis. Access to some screening sites was w ithdrawn in some cases. Screening activity has to be balanced with availability of further investigative and treatment services . As screening is a cyclical process, large variations in activity can have a knock on effect for many years to come, destabilisi ng the delivery of the future programme. Quality and standards had to be maintained at all costs. An adverse event in a screening programme can impact on thousands of individuals. 3.2 Recovery work is ongoing and the current position of each screening programme is set out in the A ppendix. Page 3 of 7 4 Quality assurance activities 4.1 Quality assurance (QA) is a core requirement of any population screening programme, to ensure that maximum benefi ts are achieved, potential harm is minimised and the programme operates within a culture of continuous improvement. It is much more than just performance management and is underpinned by benchmarking against national standards. 4.2 By their nature, screening programmes carry significant risk. While quality assurance activities act to minimise risk, false negative and false positive results are inevitable and predictable. Screening is considered a risk reduction activity and will not pick up every case of potential disease. 4.3 The PHA leads on a range of QA activities within each screening programme including: regular meetings with professional disciplines delivering the programme oversight of quality management systems and failsafe processes training advice and support leading formal peer review QA visits facilitating shared learning opportunities collation and review of statistical data supporting audit monitoring learning events and advising on the management of adverse incidents 4.4 In the context of Covid -19, core quality assurance functions were maintained to provide continuous oversight of the delivery of the programmes during the recovery phase. S ome quality assurance activities were paused or have been delivered in a slight ly different way - for example, as in person site visits have not been possible, desktop peer review exercises have been undertaken instead. 4.5 Most of these activities are now fully operational again, with plans to restart in person formal peer review Q A visits in breast screening from June 2022. 5 New developments 5.1 The PHA is also currently involved in a number of large change projects involving screening programmes. 5.2 Planning is underway for the introduction of primary HPV testing in the cervical screening programme. This development was given policy endorsement in the Regional Cancer Strategy and the PHA has commenced Page 4 of 7 discussions with the SPPG and the Pathology Network to establish the pr oject structure and coordination of this significant change to the programme. 5.3 Modelling work is being undertaken in association with Queens University Belfast to inform the options for the future expansion of the age range for bowel cancer screening i n Northern Ireland. 5.4 A large project has been established alongside the Trusts to replace the mammography equipment and mobile screening units for breast screening in Northern Ireland. 5.5 New IT software to support the functions of the breast screening system is being progressed, with a business case having been submitted to the DoH. 6 Promoting Informed Choice 6.1 The benefits of screening can only be fully achieved at population level if people take up the invitation to participate. However, as would be expected, there are inequalities in terms of who responds to screening invites . 6.2 Studies have shown that those less likely to participate in screening include those living in areas of deprivation, those with disabilities, LGBTQI individuals, and those from an ethnic minority background. 6.3 Ongoing work is needed in this area to ensure that all eligible individuals have access to information and are supported in making an informed choice about attendance at screening. 6.4 The UK NSC is very cle ar that both the benefits, potential harms and limitations of screening need to be communicated to inform this decision making process, with a recognition that some people will choose not to participate. 6.5 In order to address the inequalities in cancer screening participation the PHA has commissioned the Women's Resource and Development Agency (WRDA) to deliver educational sessions on informed choice in cancer screening , targeted at those less likely to participate. This peer delivered programme has continued throughout the pandemic, moving temporarily to virtual delivery. Examples of their work includes delivering sessions on bowel screening through the Mens Shed network, sessions on breast and cervical screening to a Syrian women's group and developmen t of new resources to make the sessions accessible to people with a sensory impairment. Page 5 of 7 7 Horizon scanning 7.1 The UK National Screening Committee has recently extended its remit to actively consider: targeted screening for high risk groups stratified screening that is more tailored to the individual average risk population screening (former approach) It will have closer links with research bodies and guideline- making organisations such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN). 7.2 It is unclear what the implications of this extended approach will have, but going forward it is anticipated that the UK NSC will make recommendations for a much broader range of screening program mes. The role that PHA will have in implementation of policies that are outside our traditional population screening remit is still to be determined. 7.3 The UK NSC is currently consulting on screening for lung cancer, which if recommended, would be the f irst targeted screening programme to be taken forward, as screening would only be offered to a proportion of individuals after a targeted risk assessment process. 7.4 Within existing programmes, there is also ongoing review by the UK NSC , assessing options for service and quality improvements. For example, there is a current focus on the potential use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in some screening programmes. Any such recommendations have implications for PHA in terms of leading the implementation. Page 6 of 7 Appendix: Screening programmes recovery position Current position re: backlogs Plans to address backlogs Bowel cancer screening A catch -up exercise is ongoing to reduce the seven -month delay caused by the initial pause in the programme during the first surge of the COVID -19 pandemic and down time in December 2020 to facilitate implementation of FIT. Managed catch -up commenced from 24 May 2021, with an additional 'call' or 'recall' list being issued every other week . The pace of the catch -up will a ccelerate from June 2022 to coincide with the cyclical reduction in invitations two years after the 'pandemic pause' in bowel screening invites, with the intention that this catch -up will be completed in Autumn 2022. Breast screening There is currently a n extended round length (interval between each offered invitation for screening mammography). The round length sh ould normally be 36 month s, but the average at end March 2022 was 3 6 months plus 4 weeks (down from 40 months in October 2020). There is ongoing requirement for social distancing and infection control measures which mean that breast screening appointments now take between 7 \u00bd and 8 minutes (reduced from 10 minutes over the past few months); instead of 6 minutes pre - COVID -19. The backlog is being addressed by working to decreas e the appointment time and the provision of additional screening clinics, both in -hours and out -of- hours, within mobile and static sites . In 2021/22 Action Cancer provide d 2,000 additional mammography appointments . However, it is unable to provide further support during 202 2/23. Cervical screening The programme continues to operate with a 5 month delay in the issue of routine letters to inform women that their next test is due. There are no current plans to address this backlog as there are ongoing service pressures at all stages of the screening pathway (GP practices, laboratories and colposcopy services) with very limited ability to further increase capacity in these areas. In line with the principles of population screening, it is considered inappropriate to address the backlog in letters, if women are then unable to access screening appointments, receive test results and undergo follow up investigations in a timely way. Catch up will be achieved through the natural run through of a screening round. A similar approach is being taken to backlogs in Scotland. Diabetic Eye Screening A risk-stratified approach to invites was introduced during covid and continues as the programme recover s. This focus es on screening Screening staff are fully deployed including 7 day working and it is unlikely that any significant additional activity can be generated from the existing resource within Page 7 of 7 the highest risk p atients . As a contingency measure during 2020/21 and 2021/22 lower risk patients were moved to a 2 year interval for screening. Further work is being done to confirm figures however the backlog is subst antial and could be approximately one fifth to one third of the screening cohort. the programme given the IPC guidance in place. Non -recurrent funding was secured in 2020/21 from the June monitoring round to support this recovery. The need for r ecurrent funding has been highlighted as a PHA investment priority for the 2022 -2025 period : to implement a recovery plan developed with the Trust, address the backlog and consolidate the modernisation of this programme into the future . This will require additional screening sites and staff to be made available. The use of the Independent Sector is also being explored, with the Trust engaged in discussions with the provider. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm screening 97% of men within the 2020/21 cohort have now been offered an initial screening appointment. Invitations commenced for men within the 2021/2 2 cohort in January 2022. From April 2022 , the screening programme has regained access to all of their screening venues. The intention is that all individuals from the 2020/21 cohort will have been offered an initial screening appointment by the end of Ju ne 2022. Staffing issues, screening venue limitations, new training requirements, difficulty recruiting into the L ead Sonographer post and accommodation issues are all impacting the programme's ability to accelerate the catch -up activity. A recovery plan is being developed to deliver additional activity during 2022/23, focusing on weekend clinics. This is dependent on securing non -recurrent funding. The programme also continues to link with other AAA programmes within the UK, to help ident ify additional suggestions or options to explore to improve attendance rates within clinics, and to minimise any lost appointments within clinics. item 14 Title of Meeting PHA Board Meeting Date 19 May 2022 Title of paper Annual Report on the Specialist Training Programme in Public Health Reference PHA/0 6/05/22 Prepared by Dr Denise O'Hagan/Dr Tracy Owen Lead Director Dr Brid Farrell Recommendation For Approval For Noting 1 Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the Annual Report on Specialist Training Programmes in Public Health to t he PHA Board for information. 2 Key Issues The PHA is the lead employer and main training provider for specialty registrars in both Public Health and Dental Public Health. Specialty training is overseen by the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency (NIMDTA) and under a Learning and Dev elopment Agreement, it is expected that the PHA Board will receive an annual update relating to training. This annual report outlines the role of the PHA in training, notes the expansion of the programme to non- medical trainees in 2021, plans for NIMDTA t o be the single lead employer for new medical appointments from August 2022, concerns about the training experience highlighted through the GMC training survey in 2021 and actions being taken to address these concerns. April 2022 Annual Report on the Specialist Training Programme in Public Health 1. Purpose This paper aims to an update the Public Health Agency (P HA) Board members regarding the Specialist Training Programme in Public Health and the recently introduced programme in Dental Public Health. 2. Background The specialist training programmes in Public Health are overseen by the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency (NIMDTA). PHA is the lead employer and main training provider for specialty registrars in both Public Health and Dental Public Health . Both training programme s aim to equip trainees with the appropriate knowledge and skills to complete the curriculum set out by the UK Faculty of Public Health (FPH) and subsequently register as a specialist /consultant with the General Medical Council or UK Public Health Register ; or in the case of Dental Public Health with the General Dental Council . They are then eligible to apply for Consultant or S pecialist posts in Public Health in organisations such as the PHA, academic institutions etc. A region such as Northern Ireland (NI) needs to have an adequate number of consultants / specialist s in place to deliver on the Public Health agenda, particularly in relation to being able to respond to health protection threats, input to service planning and address health inequalities. This has been particularly evidenced by the key role o f Public Health Consultants and Specialists in the response to the Covid -19 pandemic. Recent reports by Dr Ruth Hussey and also by the FPH have highlighted the need to enhance consultant capacity in NI. A review of the public health workforce led by the Department of Health is also due to commence shortly. 3. Role of the PHA in the delivery of training A Learning and Development Agreement (LDA) is issued to the PHA each year by NIMDTA for signature by the Chief Executive. The LDA highlights the roles and responsbilities of both parties. In addition, an annual review meeting takes place with NIMDTA , most recently in early April 2022. The LDA highlights that the PHA Board must be kept appraised of training matters. The PHA has a responsibility to engage at Director level or equivalent with NIMDTA on training issues. The assistant Director for Screening and Professional Standards has delegated responsibliity in this area and has line management r esponsibility for the group of specialty registrars . The PHA has a responsibility to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of supervisors available to deliver training and that supervisors have time in their job plans to meet their commitments in relation to their training role. Since July 2016, all Educational Supervisors and Attachm ent Supervisors must be approved by NIMDTA and the GMC. It is important that the PHA ensures that all consultants / specialists undertake the appropriate training in order to meet NIMDTA and GMC requirements and maintain their skills as supervisors. This for ms part of annual consultant April 2022 appraisal and needs to be given enhanced focus going forward to ensure an adequate pool of supervisors is maintained. 4. Structure of the training programme s General Public Health Training Programme The five year training programme follows the curriculum set out by the UK Faculty of Public Health ( FPH) . During the first year trainees undertake a funded Masters in Public Health to provide the underpinning knowledge base to sit the professional examinations. During the remaining four years trainees undertake service work in approved training locations to further develop their public health knowledge and skills . The PHA is the main training location but placements are also offered in the Department of Health, the Centre for Public Health at Queen's University and other approved locations . There is an annual review of each trainee's progress which is overseen by NIMDTA . Dental Public Health Training Programme This is a four year training programme which follows the curriculum set out by the Faculty of Dental Surgery . As above the trainee undertakes a Masters in Public Health during their first year in training . Over the remaining three years trainees undertake service work in approved training locations. In the case of the Dental Public Health trainee placements will include PHA, Department of Health and an external placement in Stirling, Scotland. 5. Recruitment to Training Programme s Recruitment to both training programmes is carried out at UK level by the relevant Faculty within the Royal Colleges of Physicians/Surgeons . In the most recent round of recruitment in 2021 there were four new registrars appointed to the general public health training programme and one new registrar appointed to the dental public health training programme. It is unlikely there will be any further recruitment to the dental training programme for the foreseeable future. Eligibility to apply to t he general public healt h training programme in NI changed in 2021 and it is now open to both medical and non- medical applicants. This brings NI into line with other parts of the UK which have been recruiting people from a range of backgrounds to the training programme for a number of years. The first non- medical trainee commenced training with the PHA in April 2021. In the absence of a functioning Executive in NI at that time, a temporary agreement was reached between the PHA, Department of Health and NIMDTA in July 2020 to enable the introduction of multidisciplinary public health training. The le gislative changes are to be brought forward in due course. Specialty Registrars in post (at April 2022) Training programme Staff in post General Public Health 12 (10.9 wte) 8 medical trainees 4 non -medical trainees (2 dentists + 2 AfC) Dental Public Health 1 (1.0 wte) April 2022 6. Employing organisation The PHA is currently the lead employer for registrars in Public Health. However , going forward from August 2022 NIMDTA will take on the role of single lead employer for newly appointed medical and dental trainees, while new non-medical trainees will continue to be employed by the PHA. This is in line with wider changes across all medical specialties. This change will only impact new appointees, wi th the PHA remaining as the employer for existing trainees until they exit the programme. 7. Funding for specialist training posts The PHA receives funding from NIMDTA for ten speciality registrar posts. NIMDTA provides the basic salary costs at mid -point of the scale. Registrars in Public Health deliver the first tier of the out -of-hours rota in Health Protection. Costs associated with the out -of-hours rota are not covered by NIMDTA and are borne by the PHA. Due to anticipated retirements and the fact that there were several vacant consultant posts in the PHA, it was agreed with NIMDTA in 2019 that the PHA would re- direct funding from vacant consultant posts to temporarily increase the number of specialty registrars from 10 to 12 wte posts. In 2020 it was further agreed that the PHA would fund an eleventh post on a recurr ent basis. 8. Pay parity for out -of-hours work Since non- medical and medical registrars both carry out the same duties when covering the out of hours rota there is a reasonable expectation that they will be paid at a similar level . However, as non- medical trainees are on Agenda for Change contracts, their Terms and Conditions relating to out -of-hours work is significantly different to that of medical staff. In England there is a Departmental circular which addresses this issue but to date there has been no equivalent circular in NI. This issue has been highlighted to the Department of Health by Human Resources but has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Thi s issue is causing concern among the non-medical registrars who are not participating in the rota until this is resolved. Out- of-hours work is a key part of training, allowing trainees to gain valuable skills. . The resulting rota gaps has also placed additional pressures on those medical trainees who are covering the rota, so steps have been taken to train and recruit duty room locum doctors to provide some out of hours support . This issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible. 9. Quality Assurance of the Training Programme NIDMTA's Public Health Specialty Training Committee oversees recruitment, annual assessment and placement of trainees and quality within the training programme. This involves reviewing feedback received from trainees and trainers as part of the national annual GMC surveys. The 2022 survey is currently open and result s will be available later in the year. The results of last year's GMC survey of trainees highli ghted some concerns which are discussed below. The survey compares responses of trainees in NI to trainees nationally across the UK. Several issues of concern were raised by NI registars. These included overall satisfaction, supportive environment, regional teaching and April 2022 educational governance. Senior PHA staff have met with trainees to discuss the findings and identify measures to address these concerns. The issues largely reflect the pressures experienced during COVID -19 by our small pool of registrars and consultants in NI who were at the front line of the COVID response. These pressures were compounded by the trainees feeling isolated when working remotely. Similar issues were reported by registrars across the UK but were likely felt more acutely in NI due to our smaller workforce and role in a regional organisation. Efforts have been made throughout the pandemic to support registrars and introduce arrang ements to minimise the burden, particularly in the out -of-hours period. Some of the issues that have arisen in the survey reflect the fact that registrars predominantly do project work and are not formally attached to teams , apart from the Health Protection team , and can therefore feel disconnected from the wider organisation. New arr angements are being made for attachments to teams and these will be introduced shortly. A forum to raise concerns in Health Protection has also been re- established to strengthen the registrar voice. Formal attachments to teams and a return to working in the office in the near future should help registars feel better engaged. With the recent closure of the Health and Social Care Board it is important that registrars can continue to gain experience and competency in all areas of the training curriculum. This will have to be monitored carefully going forward and appropriate placements arranged as required. Registrars need to be fully engaged across the full breadth of public health practice. It is also important to ensure adequate attention to wellbeing and adequate capacity in the organisation to respond to future pandemics and similar scenarios to prevent burnout among this group of staff . The findings of the 2022 GMC survey will be closely monitored and additional actions taken to address any outstanding c oncerns. 10. Future direction The PHA Board will continue to be provided with an annual update going forward in relation to the specialist training programmes . A workforce review is about to commence led by the Department of Health. It is likely that a substantial increase in funded training positions may be required. While this paper focuses on training towards FPH ' specialist/consultant ' status, it is likely that in coming years there will be demand from within the existing non- medical workforce in PHA for more defined career paths and the opportunity to work towards both practitioner and eventually specialist registration with the "}
