Nobody in our lifetime has ever experienced such a pandemic and we are feeling anxious about how little we know about the nature of this virus. We are being subjected to a lot of misinformation, but to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no cure or vaccine for Covid-19, and no one can yet guarantee when these will become available. In the face of much misleading information, it is important for all of us to remain vigilant, and to seek information only from trusted sources. The ancient science of [Ayurveda](https://sunshineayurveda.com.au/what-is-ayurveda/) dates back to 5000 years and it has stood the test of time. Although there is no mention of a Coronavirus in any of its textbooks, Ayurveda nevertheless recognizes the fact that pandemics can occur. In these times of crisis, it is important to balance the mind, body, and spirit to stay safe and healthy. The main objectives of Ayurvedic science are to promote good health and prevent disease by enhancing our immune system through natural methods. Thus the practice of Ayurveda can play an important role in the maintenance of optimal health and safety during this Corona virus pandemic. Until such time as a vaccine becomes available, we should all adopt a preventative approach to boost our immunity against the virus. Boost your Immunity Recent research has shown that the Corona virus does not discriminate between sex, age, location, etc. However, the outbreak has shown that the sate of a person's immune system plays a significant role in how they are affected by the virus. The stronger your immune system, the better equipped you are to fight against disease and infection. Vulnerable people, with diminished immune systems, are more likely to succumb to Covid-19. Those who have a strong immune system are likely to have only minor symptoms and recover quickly. However, according to Ayurvedic medicine, a strong immune system is not built overnight. Taking the occasional dietary supplement or medication will not magically boost your immune system. Ayurveda recommends the long term practice of a healthy diet and lifestyle that suits your constitution, that is, your doshas, namely Vata Pitta or Kapha. The recommended diet and lifestyle aims to address your [dosha](https://sunshineayurveda.com.au/panchakarma-detox-2/quiz/) imbalances, and it is varied according to the seasons of the year. Instead of short term fixes, Ayurveda promotes the long term practice of daily routines that include exercise, work, study, leisure, and time spent with family. To live Ayurveda is not only to fight against the Corona virus, but to protect yourself against all diseases. Ayurveda has an extensive knowledge base with respect to preventative measures for the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. These are derived from the concepts of \"Dinacharya\" (daily routines) and \"Ritucharya\" (seasonal regimens). As we now go through the end of autumn in Australia, there is a particular pattern of diet and lifestyle that should be followed to help boost our immune system. An Ayurvedic doctor can recommend a personalized diet and detox program based on your specific constitution (doshas). Ayurveda promotes diet as the primary medicine, and lifestyle and herbs as a part of the healing program. The food that you eat should be your first source of natural medicine. It is important to choose foods that help maintain a healthy balance of mind-body state. If you achieve good health through your diet, you are less likely to require other medications. Address existing health conditions and imbalances People who have existing health problems and whose immunity is compromised are the most vulnerable in this pandemic. The risk of succumbing to the Corona virus is higher for people who are already suffering from diabetes, cardiac conditions, and auto-immune diseases. If you suffering from an acute ailment or chronic disease, Ayurveda is able to offer natural means of easing your symptoms and managing your health. Ayurveda recommends a seasonal detox to promote good health and to boost your immune system. Panchakarma (Ayurvedic Detox) According to Ayurveda, a regular detox is an essential component of a healthy lifestyle. Regular detox is recommended with every change of seasons, and also whenever there is an important event in your life, or if you feel that there are changes in your health status. Autumn is one of the best seasons for doing a detox as it helps build up your immunity in preparation for the colder months ahead. [Panchakarma ](https://sunshineayurveda.com.au/panchakarma-detox-2/what-is-panchakarma/)(Ayurvedic detox) can be done entirely at home or it may combine home treatment with visits to the Ayurvedic centre. An [Ayurvedic doctor](https://sunshineayurveda.com.au/dr-ram-mani-bhandari/) can help tailor a detox program that suits you. A detox program includes a range of [Ayurvedic therapies](https://sunshineayurveda.com.au/panchakarma-therapy/ayurvedic-therapies/), such as [Ayurvedic massage](https://sunshineayurveda.com.au/panchakarma-therapy/ayurvedic-massage/), and it is accompanied with a number of recommendations with respect to diet, including diverse herbs for you to take according to your constitution. Ayurvedic Home Remedies Ayurveda strongly recommends the practice of home remedies with kitchen herbs and spices for the overall upkeep of your health. There are many simple remedies that help boost your immunity and keep disease at bay. The Ministry of Ayush in India has published some general guidelines for the maintenance of daily health. These include: - Drinking warm water throughout the day. - The daily practise of yoga. This may include asanas, Pranayama, and meditation for at least 30 minutes. - The incorporation of spices like turmeric, cumin, and coriander in your daily cooking to help boost your immune system. Ayurvedic Herbs and Medicines Ayurveda is a purely plant-based science and the application of its remedies do not cause adverse effects. The herbs and spices promoted by Ayurveda to boost your immunity, to detox-cleanse, and restore your imbalances have proven to work wonders. Nevertheless, it is recommended that consult an Ayurveda doctor or professional for advice on the correct choice and combination of herbs and spices that will be most beneficial for your health. Mind Support During this time of uncertainty and crisis, it is common to experience a wide range of mental concerns and emotional stress. Ayurveda can offer personal advice to address these issues. Ayurvedic therapies include healing massages, oil treatments, and the practice of mindfulness, which can help you recover your peace of mind. These practices are designed to bring back the strength of \"Prana\", your mind-body energy that will help your fight against adversity. What can we offer at Sunshine Ayurveda?
