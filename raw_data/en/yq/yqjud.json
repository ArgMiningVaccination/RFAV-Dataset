Berger (1953-1993). The diet was based on the false idea that many people have hidden [food allergies](/wiki/Food_allergy) and that by eliminating certain foods and taking dietary supplements the body's [immune system](/wiki/Immune_system) would be strengthened. History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Immune_Power_Diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Berger authored Dr. Berger's Immune Power Diet in 1985. The book states that different health problems including [AIDS](/wiki/HIV/AIDS) and [obesity](/wiki/Obesity) are the result of an \"immune hypersensitivity response\" to common foods and that \" [detoxification](/wiki/Detoxification_(alternative_medicine))\", [dietary supplements](/wiki/Dietary_supplement) and weight loss can strengthen the immune system. [[1]](#cite_note-Butler-1) [[2]](#cite_note-Barrett-2) [[3]](#cite_note-3) Berger advises his readers to eliminate what he called the \"Sinister Seven\" from their diets, as they cause immune damage. [[4]](#cite_note-Yetiv-4) These include [dairy](/wiki/Dairy_product), wheat, yeast, [eggs](/wiki/Egg), corn, [soy](/wiki/Soy) and [sugar](/wiki/Sugar). After \"detoxifying\" the immune system and elimination was completed, these foods could be gradually eaten again, but no more than once every four days. [[1]](#cite_note-Butler-1) [[4]](#cite_note-Yetiv-4) In 1994, an autopsy revealed that Berger died from [hypertension](/wiki/Hypertension) and [cardiovascular disease](/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease). Contributing factors to his death were [cocaine addiction](/wiki/Cocaine_dependence) and obesity. [[5]](#cite_note-5) Criticism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Immune_Power_Diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] The Immune Power Diet was criticized as unscientific and described as [quackery](/wiki/Quackery) by nutritionists. [[1]](#cite_note-Butler-1) [[4]](#cite_note-Yetiv-4) The [Harvard Medical School](/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School) Health Letter suggested the book was fiction and based on quack ideas about food allergies. [[2]](#cite_note-Barrett-2) The diet may cause [malnutrition](/wiki/Malnutrition). [[6]](#cite_note-6) Berger's claim that 30% of American people have food allergies is not supported by scientific research. [[1]](#cite_note-Butler-1) [[7]](#cite_note-7) The real figure (as of 2017) is less than 4%. [[8]](#cite_note-8) [[9]](#cite_note-9) Berger advocated dangerous [megavitamin](/wiki/Megavitamin_therapy) supplements for different ills which were unsupported by scientific evidence. Nutritionist Jack Z. Yetiv noted that Berger recommended his patients to megadose on [Vitamin B6](/wiki/Vitamin_B6) supplements but these have been shown to be toxic in large amounts and the cause of irreversible nerve damage. [[4]](#cite_note-Yetiv-4) The Immune Power Diet is listed by immunologists as an ineffective treatment for AIDS.
