Participants must disclose to Museum staff when they test positive or if they have been exposed to COVID-19. Exposure to COVID-19 An inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html), COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. Although the Museum has taken enhanced health and safety measures, it cannot guarantee that you or members of your group will not be exposed to COVID-19 while at the Museum. The cooperation and participation of our visitors in following health and safety protocols and requirements is essential to better ensure that all within the Museum remain healthy and safe. Your adherence and the adherence of anyone in your group (including children) to the Museum's [Code of Conduct](/plan-your-visit/code-of-conduct) is mandatory, and noncompliance may result in removal from the Museum. By visiting the Museum, you voluntarily assume all risks for yourself and minors in your custody and understand that you may be exposed to or infected by COVID-19 by entering the Museum.
