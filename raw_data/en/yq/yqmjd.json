Here, we investigated the genomic profiles of LGLL with a focus on STAT3 and STAT5B mutations in a cohort of 49 patients (41 T-LGLL, 8 CLPD-NK). Our study indicated that STAT3 was identified in 38.8% (19/49) of all patients, while STAT5B occurred in only 8.2% (4/49) of patients. We found that STAT3 mutations were associated with lower ANC in T-LGLL patients. The average number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in STAT3/STAT5B-mutated patients was significantly higher than that in WT patients (1.781.17 vs 0.651.36, p=0.0032). Additionally, TET2-only mutated T-LGLL (n=5) had a significant reduction in platelet values compared the WT (n=16) or STAT3-only mutated (n=12) (p<0.05). the somatic mutational landscape between STAT3/STAT5B WT and mutated patients and correlate with their distinct clinical characteristics.

As yet, however, little is known about MPN-specific modulators of proteostasis, thus impeding our ability for increased mechanistic understanding and discovery of additional therapeutic targets. Loss of proteostasis, in itself, is traced to dysregulated mechanisms in protein folding and intracellular calcium signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, using ex vivo and in vitro systems (including CD34+ cultures from patient bone marrow, and healthy cord/peripheral blood specimens), we extend our prior data from MPN patient platelet RNA sequencing, and discover select proteostasis-associated markers at RNA and/or protein levels in each of platelets, parent megakaryocytes, and whole blood specimens. Importantly, we identify a novel role in MPNs for enkurin (ENKUR), a calcium mediator protein, implicated originally only in spermatogenesis. Our data reveal consistent ENKUR downregulation at both RNA and protein levels across MPN patient specimens and experimental models, with a concomitant upregulation of a cell cycle marker, CDC20. Silencing of ENKUR by shRNA in CD34+ derived megakaryocytes further confirm this association with CDC20 at both RNA and protein levels; and indicate a likely role for the PI3K/Akt pathway. The inverse association of ENKUR and CDC20 expression was further confirmed upon treatment with thapsigargin (an agent that causes protein misfolding in the ER by selective loss of calcium) in both megakaryocyte and platelet fractions at RNA and protein levels. Together, our work sheds light on enkurin as a novel marker of MPN pathogenesis beyond the genetic alterations; and indicates further mechanistic investigation into a role for dysregulated calcium homeostasis, and ER and protein folding stress in MPN transformation.

Tobacco smoking is an environmental factor associated with a greater incidence of AML, but there have been limited studies that evaluated smoking toward overall survival. We retrospectively searched for AML cases and collected clinical and diagnostic data for each case. We also used an independent next-generation sequencing (NGS) dataset to assess for a distinct mutational signature associated with smoking. When stratified by smoking status, there was a greater number of males, patients > 60 years of age, and patients with > 2 comorbidities within the smoking category (P < 0.05). Survival analysis demonstrated decreased survival probability in the smokers, male smokers, smokers with 1 other comorbidity, and smokers without a prior history of non-hematopoietic malignancy (P < 0.05) as compared to non-smokers. Smoking was associated with a decrease in survival within the WHO categories of AML NOS (P = 0.035) and AML RGA (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that patients who were smokers had a greater HR as compared to non-smokers after adjusting for the other covariates. Our findings demonstrated that smoking was independently associated with decreased overall survival after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. In addition, our results suggest that a mutational signature can be recognized using NGS data in a subset of AML patients who smoke.

Application of these technologies for tracking disease burden can be valuable in detecting recurrence, determining response to therapy, guiding future management of patients, and establishing endpoints for clinical trials. In this study, the performance of the commercially available LymphoTrack high-throughput sequencing assay was assessed for determining residual disease burden in patients with various T-cell malignancies seen at our institution. A custom bioinformatics pipeline and database was also developed to facilitate MRD analysis and clinical reporting. This assay demonstrated excellent test performance characteristics, achieving a sensitivity of 1 out of 100,000 T-cell equivalents for the DNA inputs evaluated and high concordance with orthogonal testing methods. This assay was further utilized to correlate disease burden in several patients, demonstrating its potential utility for monitoring patients with T-cell malignancies.

However, a number of features suggest alternative mechanisms of platelet destruction. In this study, we use a multi-dimensional approach to explore the role of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in ITP. We characterised patients with ITP and compared them to age-matched controls using immunophenotyping, next-generation sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR) genes, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional T cell and platelet assays. We found that adults with chronic ITP have increased polyfunctional, terminally differentiated effector memory interferon-g, factor-a, Granzyme B defining them as TEMRA cells. These TEMRA cells expand when the platelet count falls and show no evidence of physiological exhaustion. Deep sequencing of the T cell receptor showed expanded T cell clones in patients with ITP. T cell clones persisted over many years, were more prominent in patients with refractory disease, and expanded when the platelet count was low. Combined single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of CD8+ T cells confirmed that the expanded clones are TEMRA cells. Using in vitro model systems, we show that CD8+ T cells from patients with ITP form aggregates with autologous platelets, release interferon-g and trigger platelet activation and apoptosis through TCR-mediated release of cytotoxic granules. These findings of clonally expanded CD8+ T cells causing platelet activation and apoptosis provide an antibody-independent mechanism of platelet destruction, indicating that targeting specific T-cell clones could be a novel therapeutic approach for patients with refractory ITP.

Recent studies have showed worse prognosis for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing stem cell transplant, that have concomitant presence of CHIP. Data regarding the clinical and biological role of CHIP in plasma cell dyscrasias (PCDs) is rapidly increasing. However, the prevalence and prognostic implication of CHIP in patients with MM outside of the transplant setting, and in those with other more indolent PCDs remains elusive. Here we explored the prevalence and clinical implications of CHIP detected through next-generation sequencing in 209 patients with PCDs including MM, light chain (AL) amyloidosis (ALA), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). To avoid attributing the mutations to the plasma cell clone, CHIP was defined as the presence of DNMT3A, TET2, or ASXL1 mutations in the peripheral blood or bone marrow (DTA-CH). The prevalence of DTA-CH was 19% in patients with PCDs, with no difference between each PCD. TET2 (23%) and DNMT3A (22%), were the most frequently mutated genes. DTA-CH correlated with older age in MM (P=.001) and MGUS/SMM (P=0.0007), as well as with coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure in MM (P=.03). DTA-CH did not predict worse OS or PFS in either MM or ALA, nor it predict higher risk of progression to MM in patients with MGUS/SMM. Our results overall further elucidate the prevalence and mutational spectrum of CHIP in PCDs, providing more information regarding the clinical relevance of CHIP in this patient population.

However, conventional methods for identification of Hb variants in clinical laboratories can be inadequate due to the lack of structural characterization. We describe the use of neutral-coating capillary electrophoresis coupled with high-resolution ECE-001 capillary electrophoresis (Ce) an EMASS-II PS1 neutral-coating capillary was used for CE. Samples of red blood cells were lysed in water and diluted in 10mM ammonium formate buffer for analysis. Deconvolution of raw mass spectrometry data was carried out to merge multiple charge states and isotopic peaks of an analyte to obtain its monoisotopic mass.RESULTS: neutral-coating CE separate individual dissociated from intact Hb forms, and the HR-MS could achieve both intact-protein analysis and top-down analysis of analytes. A number of patient samples that contain Hb subunit variants were analyzed, and the variants were successfully identified using the CE-HR-MS method.CONCLUSIONS: The CE-HR-MS method has been demonstrated as a useful tool for top-down identification of Hb variants. With the ability to characterize the primary structures of Hb subunits, the CE-HR-MS method has significant advantages to complement or partially replace the conventional methods for the identification of Hb variants.

Screening programs can detect most NPC cases at an early stage, but existing EBV diagnostics are limited by false positives and low positive predictive value (PPV), leading to excess screening endoscopies, MRIs, and repeated testing. Recent EBV genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that EBV BALF2 variants account for more than 80% of attributable NPC risk. We therefore hypothesized that high-risk BALF2 variants could be readily detected in plasma for once-lifetime screening triage.We designed and validated a multiplex genotyping assay to detect EBV BALF2 polymorphisms in human plasma. Targeted next-generation sequencing was used to validate this assay, conduct association studies with clinical phenotype, and longitudinally genotype plasma to assess within-host haplotype stability. We examined the association between NPC and BALF2 haplotypes in a large non-endemic population and three prior EBV GWAS. Finally, we estimated NPC mortality reduction, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of BALF2 variant-informed screening using concordance with sequencing in a cohort of 24 NPC cases and 155 non-NPC controls. BALF2 haplotype was highly associated with NPC in this non-endemic population (I613V: odds ratio [OR] 7.9; V317M: OR 178.8). No other candidate BALF2 polymorphisms were significantly associated with NPC or hematologic disorders. Longitudinal genotyping revealed 97.8% within-host haplotype concordance, indicative of lifelong latent infection. In a meta-analysis of 755 NPC cases and 981 non-NPC controls, BALF2 I613V and V317M were significantly associated with NPC in both endemic and non-endemic populations. Modeled variant-informed screening strategies achieved a 46% relative increase in PPV with 7% decrease in effective screening sensitivity, thereby averting nearly half of screening endoscopies/MRIs among endemic populations in east/southeast Asia.EBV BALF2 haplotypes are temporally stable within hosts and can be readily detected in plasma via an inexpensive multiplex genotyping assay that offers near-perfect non-endemic populations, I613V and V317M were highly associated with NPC and could be leveraged to develop variant-informed screening programs that mitigate false positives with small reductions in screening sensitivity.

RT-PCR screening of 16 regions from 20 COVID-19 autopsies found SARS-CoV-2 E gene viral sequences in 7 regions (2.5% of 320 samples), concentrated in 4/20 subjects (20%). Additional screening of olfactory bulb (OB), and entorhinal area for E, N1, N2, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and S gene sequences detected one or more of these in OB in 8/21 subjects (38%). It is uncertain whether these RNA sequences represent viable virus. Significant histopathology was limited to 2/42 cases (4.8%), one with a large acute cerebral infarct and one with hemorrhagic encephalitis. Case-control RNAseq in OB and AMY found more than 5000 and 700 differentially expressed genes, respectively, unrelated to RT-PCR results; these involved immune response, neuronal constituents, and olfactory/taste receptor genes. Olfactory marker protein-1 reduction COVID-19-related loss of OB olfactory mucosa afferents. Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia had and AMY, and cytokine arrays showed generalized downregulation in AMY and upregulation in blood serum in COVID-19 cases. Although OB is a major brain portal for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 brain changes are more likely due to blood-borne immune mediators and trans-synaptic gene expression changes arising from OB deafferentation.

The TR assay was most commonly requested (42 [71%]), followed by the somatic mutation panel (32 [54%]) and IG assay (26 [44%]). NGS studies were associated with a change in the diagnostic line in about half of cases (28 [47%]) and in a change in the likelihood of a diagnosis in a further 16 cases (27%); there was no diagnostic impact of NGS testing in 15 cases (25%).Implementation of NGS panel somatic mutation or IG/TR gene rearrangement assays on small-volume biopsies contributes to the diagnosis of LPDs in the majority of select cases for diagnostic purposes. The molecular diagnosis is considered in the context of the clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic findings and does not by itself lead to a definitive diagnosis in small-volume biopsies.

Although detailed genetic characterization requires whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeted nucleic acid amplification tests can serve a complementary role in clinical settings, as they are more rapid and accessible than sequencing in most laboratories. We designed and analytically validated multiplex reaction 1 and del69-70, K417N, and T478K in reaction 2. This assay had 95 to 100% agreement with WGS for 502 upper respiratory tract swab samples collected between 26 April 2021 and 1 August 2021, consisting of 43 Alpha, 2 Beta, 20 Gamma, 378 Delta, and 59 non-VOC infections. Validation in a separate group of 230 WGS-confirmed Omicron variant samples collected in December 2021 and January 2022 demonstrated 100% agreement. This RT-qPCR-based approach can be implemented in clinical laboratories already performing SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests to assist in local epidemiological surveillance and clinical decision-making.

To study the underlying pathophysiology and genetic and cellular associations with CTP, we applied systems biology approaches to two patients with stable platelet cycling and reciprocal thrombopoietin (TPO) cycling at multiple time points through 2 cycles. Blood transcriptome analysis revealed cycling of platelet-specific genes, which are in parallel with and precede platelet count oscillation, indicating that cyclical platelet production leads platelet count cycling in both patients. Additionally, neutrophil and erythrocyte-specific genes also showed fluctuations correlating with platelet count changes, consistent with TPO effects on hematopoietic progenitors. Moreover, we found novel genetic associations with CTP. One patient had a novel germline heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) thrombopoietin receptor (GOF) in signal transducer and activator of 3 (STAT3). In addition, both patients had clonal T-cell populations that remained stable throughout platelet count cycles. These mutations and clonal T cells may potentially involve in the pathogenic baseline in these patients rendering exaggerated persistent thrombopoiesis oscillations of their intrinsic rhythm upon homeostatic perturbations. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of CTP and possible therapies.

However, recognition of certain limitations inherent to amplicon-based NGS assays is crucial for the correct interpretation and reporting of variants in the clinical setting. In this report, we illustrate three different potential pitfalls related to amplicon-based NGS assays based on our institutional experience and highlight how the risk of such events can be minimised.

Currently, there are no specific morphologic or immunophenotypic features that allow accurate detection of POLEmut tumors without molecular testing. Consequently, identifying POLEmut tumors has been challenging without employing costly and/or time-consuming DNA sequencing approaches. Here we developed a novel SNaPshot assay to facilitate routine and efficient POLE mutation testing in EC. The SNaPshot assay interrogates 15 nucleotide sites within exons 9, 11, 13, and 14 encoding the POLE exonuclease domain. The variant sites were selected based on recurrence, evidence of functional impact, association with high tumor mutation burden and/or detection in EC clinical outcome studies. Based on the pathogenic somatic variants reported in the literature, the assay is predicted to have a clinical sensitivity of 90% to 95% for ECs. Validation studies showed 100% specificity and sensitivity for the variants covered, with expected genotypic results for both the positive (n=11) and negative (n=20) patient controls on multiple repeat tests and dilution series. Analytic sensitivity was conservatively approximated at a 10% variant allele fraction (VAF), with documented detection as low as 5% VAF. As expected, the SNaPshot assay demonstrated greater sensitivity than Sanger sequencing for VAFs below 20%, an important characteristic for somatic mutation detection. Here we have developed and validated the first SNaPshot assay to detect hotspot POLE mutations. While next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing-based approaches have also been used to detect POLE mutations, a SNaPshot approach provides useful balance of analytical sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency in a high-volume case load setting.

Here, profiling the three chronic subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we identify the blood platelet transcriptome as a proxy strategy for highly sensitive progression biomarkers that also enables prediction of advanced disease via machine-learning algorithms. The MPN platelet transcriptome reveals an incremental molecular reprogramming that is independent of patient driver mutation status or therapy. Subtype-specific markers offer mechanistic and therapeutic insights, and highlight impaired proteostasis and a persistent integrated stress response. Using a LASSO model with validation in two independent cohorts, we identify the advanced subtype MF at high accuracy and offer a robust progression signature toward clinical translation. Our platelet transcriptome snapshot of chronic MPNs demonstrates a proof-of-principle for disease risk stratification and progression beyond genetic data alone, with potential utility in other progressive disorders.

This study aimed to determine the frequency, duration, and concentration of nucleocapsid antigen in plasma and its association with COVID-19 severity.METHODS: We utilized an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen to evaluate 777 plasma samples from 104 individuals with COVID-19. We compared plasma antigen to respiratory nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in 74 individuals with COVID-19 from samples collected 1day of diagnostic respiratory NAAT, and in 52 SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests, multivariable logistic regression, and mixed-effects modeling to evaluate whether plasma antigen concentration was associated with disease severity.RESULTS: Plasma antigen had 91.9% (95% CI 83.2-97.0%) clinical sensitivity and 94.2% (84.1-98.8%) clinical specificity. Antigen-negative plasma samples belonged to patients with later respiratory cycle thresholds (Ct) when compared with antigen-positive plasma samples. Median plasma antigen concentration (log10 fg/mL) was 5.4 (IQR 3.9-6.0) in outpatients, 6.0 (5.4-6.5) in inpatients, and 6.6 (6.1-7.2) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In models adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, and hypertension, plasma antigen concentration at diagnosis was associated with ICU admission (OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.2-6.2], P=.01), but not with non-ICU hospitalization. Rate of antigen decrease was not associated with disease severity.CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 plasma nucleocapsid antigen exhibited comparable diagnostic performance to upper respiratory NAAT, especially among those with late respiratory Ct. In addition to currently available tools, antigenemia may facilitate patient triage to optimize intensive care utilization.

Genomic surveillance is an important tool for pandemic response, but many laboratories do not have the resources to support population-level sequencing. We hypothesized that a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to genotype mutations in the viral spike protein could facilitate high-throughput variant surveillance. We designed and analytically validated a one-step multiplex allele-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain spike protein mutations with next-generation whole-genome sequencing. We then screened a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from our San Francisco Bay Area population. Between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we screened 4,049 unique infections by genotyping RT-qPCR, with an assay failure rate of 2.8%. L452R 34 sequencing in and P.2 assay revealed rapid emergence of L452R in our population, with a prevalence of 24.8% in December 2020 that increased to 62.5% in March 2021. We developed and clinically implemented a genotyping RT-qPCR to conduct high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 variant screening. This approach can be adapted for emerging mutations and immediately implemented in laboratories already performing NAAT worldwide using existing equipment, personnel, and extracted nucleic acid.

DOACs interfere with clot-based testing for the identification of lupus anticoagulant antibodies (LACs) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a common cause of acquired thrombotic disease.To evaluate a commercially available reagent DOAC-Stop for the removal of DOAC interference encountered in LAC testing.We collected a cohort of 73 test samples from patients on DOAC therapy identified at a large institutional coagulation laboratory from March to December 2019, along with samples from 40 LAC positive and negative control patients not on therapy. Samples were treated with DOAC-Stop and tested for anti-Xa activity and thrombin time for the removal of apixaban, rivaroxaban, argatroban, and dabigatran activity from patient samples. Treated and untreated samples were tested using the activated partial thromboplastin time, silica clotting time, and dilute Russell's viper venom time to evaluate the reliability and utility of DOAC-Stop.DOAC-Stop markedly reduced DOAC interference from test samples (P<.05). DOAC-Stop had no effect on LAC testing in the absence of DOAC therapy, permitting the identification of all LAC positive and negative controls. DOAC-Stop removed false positives and false negatives resulting from DOAC interference and allows the identification of patients meeting criteria for the diagnosis of APS by LAC testing, as well as the detection of patients on rivaroxaban who are triple positive for APS.DOAC-Stop is an effective adjunct for the clinical laboratory faced with DOAC interference in LAC testing.

Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis.There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19.

Conventional methods for assessing FLT3-ITD status and allele burden have been primarily limited to PCR fragment size analysis due to the inherent difficulty in detecting large ITD variants by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In this study, we assess the performance of publicly available bioinformatic tools for the detection and quantification of FLT3-ITDs in clinical hybridization-capture NGS data. We found that FLT3_ITD_ext had the highest overall accuracy for detecting FLT3-ITDs and was able to accurately quantify allele burden. Although all other tools evaluated were able to detect FLT3-ITDs reasonably well, allele burden was consistently underestimated. We were able to significantly improve quantification of FLT3-ITD allelic burden independent of the detection method by utilizing soft-clipped reads and/or ITD junctional sequences. In addition, we show that identifying mutant reads by previously identified junctional sequences further improves the sensitivity of detecting FLT3-ITDs in post-treatment samples. Our results demonstrate that FLT3-ITDs can be reliably detected in clinical NGS data using available bioinformatic tools. We further describe how accurate quantification of FLT3-ITD allele burden can be added on to existing clinical NGS pipelines for routine assessment of FLT3-ITD status in patients with AML.

Transfusions early during disease course was found to be beneficial. Lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic could inform early responses to future pandemics and may continue to be relevant in lower resource settings. We sought to identify factors correlating to high antibody titers in convalescent plasma donors and understand the magnitude and pharmacokinetic time course of both transfused antibody titers and the endogenous antibody titers in transfused recipients.Methods: Plasma samples were collected up to 174 days after convalescence from 93 CCP donors with mild disease, and from 16 COVID-19 patients before and after transfusion. Using ELISA, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD, S1, and N-protein antibodies, as well as capacity of antibodies to block ACE2 from binding to RBD was measured in an in vitro assay. As an estimate for viral load, viral RNA and N-protein plasma levels were assessed in COVID-19 patients.Results: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and RBD-ACE2 blocking capacity were highest within the first 60 days after symptom resolution and markedly decreased after 120 days. Highest antibody titers were found in CCP donors that experienced fever. Effect of transfused CCP was detectable in COVID-19 patients who received high-titer CCP and had not seroconverted at the time of transfusion. Decrease in viral RNA was seen in two of these patients.Conclusion: Our results suggest that high titer CCP should be collected within 60 days after recovery from donors with past fever. The much lower titers conferred by transfused antibodies compared to endogenous production in the patient underscore the importance of providing CCP prior to endogenous seroconversion.

The use of myeloid next generation sequencing panels has led to the detection of several mutations in patients previously diagnosed with HEUS, reassigning some patients to the category of HEN, specifically the World Health Organization category of chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS). Here we describe a novel somatic JAK1 pseudokinase domain mutation (R629_S632delinsSA) in a patient with HE that had been initially characterized as a variant of uncertain significance. We performed functional studies that demonstrate that this mutation results in growth factor independence of Ba/F3 cells in vitro and activation of the Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription Proteins (JAK-STAT) were abrogated by the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. The R629_S632delinsSA is the first known in JAK1 linked to a clonal eosinophilic neoplasm, and highlights the importance of the JAK-STAT pathway in eosinophil survival.

This poses a serious challenge to clinical diagnosis, laboratory testing, and infection control programs.To evaluate the performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion Respiratory Assays (RA) compared to the GenMark ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) and to assess the ability of the Panther Fusion to perform parallel testing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses from a single sample.A diagnostic comparison study was carried out using 375 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. Assay performance was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient.Overall agreement between the Fusion RA and ePlex RPP was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), positive percent agreement was 97.2 % (95 % CI 93.0-99.2), negative percent agreement was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), and the kappa coefficient was 0.85 (95 % CI 0.81-0.89). Forty additional viruses in 30 specimens were detected by Fusion that were not detected by ePlex. The maximum specimen throughput for parallel testing of the Fusion Respiratory Assays with SARS-CoV-2 was 275 samples in 20.7 h for Fusion SARS-CoV-2 and 350 samples in 20.0 h for Aptima Transcription Mediated Amplification SARS-CoV-2.Fusion RA demonstrated substantial agreement compared to the ePlex RPP. However, the Fusion detected respiratory viruses not identified by ePlex, consistent with higher clinical sensitivity. Workflows for parallel testing of respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate that the Panther Fusion instrument provides a flexible, moderate to high throughput testing option for pandemic and seasonal respiratory viruses.

Although fragment analysis by PCR and capillary electrophoresis (CE) is the current standard for such assessment in clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories, it does not provide sequence information and is only semi-quantitative. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assays are an attractive alternative to the conventional fragment-size based methods since they generate results with specific clonotype sequence information and allow for more accurate quantitation. We therefore evaluated various test parameters and performance characteristics for a commercially available NGS-based TRG gene rearrangement assay by testing 101 clinical samples previously characterized by fragment analysis. The NGS TRG assay showed an overall accuracy of 83% and an analytical specificity of 100%, as compared to the CE-based assay. The concordance rate was 8895% for V1-8, V10 and V11 gene families, but lower for the V9 gene family. This difference was mostly attributed to the incomplete polyclonal symmetry resulting from the two-tube CE assay versus the one-tube design of the NGS assay. The NGS assay also demonstrated strengths in distinguishing different clonotypes with the same fragment size. Our clinical validation demonstrated robust performance of the NGS-based TRG assay and identified potential pitfalls associated with CE assay design that are important for understanding the observed discrepancies with the CE-based assay.

Signatures 4 (associated with tobacco smoking) and 7 (associated with ultraviolet radiation) as an indicator of pulmonary or cutaneous primary sites showed moderate sensitivity and high specificity at optimal cutpoints. Mutational signatures in malignancies with unknown primaries were somewhat consistent with the clinically suspected primary site, with an apparent dose-response relationship between the number of variants analyzed and the ability of mutational signature analysis to correctly suggest a primary site.Mutational signatures represent an opportunity for orthogonal testing of primary site, which may be particularly useful in supporting cutaneous or pulmonary sites in poorly differentiated neoplasms. Tobacco smoking, ultraviolet radiation, and POLe mutational signatures are the most appropriate signatures for implementation. Even relatively small numbers of variants appear capable of supporting a clinically suspected primary.

Previous studies have shown a subset of this entity to have clonal T-cell populations via PCR based assays. In this study, we sought to implement next generation sequencing as a more sensitive and specific test to examine for T-cell clonality within the pediatric population.We identified 18 biopsy specimens from 12 pediatric patients with clinical and histopathologic findings compatible with PL. Patient demographics, clinical features, management, and histopathologic findings were reviewed. All specimens were analyzed for clonality with next generation sequencing of T-cell receptor beta (TRB) and gamma (TRG) genes.Of the 12 patients, 9 (75%) had complete resolution of lesions at the time of data collection (mean follow up 31 months). The remaining three patients significantly improved with methotrexate (with or without acitretin). Interestingly, 7 of 12 patients (58%) and 9 of 17 biopsy specimens (53%) showed evidence of T-cell clonality. Two patients showed matching TRB clones from different anatomic sites.T-cell clonality is a common finding in PL, likely representing a \"reactive clonality\" rather than a true lymphoproliferative disorder. Clonality alone cannot be used as a means to distinguish PL from lymphomatoid papulosis or cutaneous lymphoma. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

To determine their incidence, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive adult patients (n=127) with large B-cell lymphoma or and 8 (6.3%) patients developed bleeding and thrombosis within first 3 months, respectively. In the axi-cel subgroup, these occurred in 11.2% and 6.7%, respectively. Bleeding occurred between days 8-30 (median 17.5), and thrombosis between days 2-91 (median 29). Bleeding sites intracranial (N=2), gastrointestinal features of consumptive coagulopathy. On univariate analysis, patients with bleeding were older (median 72 vs. 60 yrs, P<0.01), had lower baseline platelets (86 vs. 178 K/uL, P<0.01), lower platelet nadir after fibrinogen nadir and elevated LDH (P=0.01). ICANS grade 3 was associated with increased bleeding (50% vs. 15%; P=0.01), thrombosis (50% vs. 16%; P=0.04), PT prolongation, elevated D-dimer. A paucity of events limited multivariate analysis, however low pre-treatment platelets were associated with bleeding in a multivariate logistic regression model. Patients with thrombocytopenia or severe ICANS are at increased risk of bleeding complications and should be closely monitored particularly within the first month after CAR therapy. Future studies in larger cohorts should assess risk factors for systemic coagulopathies in CAR-T therapy, including their association with neurotoxicity.

However, the effect of dilution on analytical sensitivity through sample pooling has not been well characterized. We tested 1,648 prospectively pooled specimens by using 3 nucleic acid amplification tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: a laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting the envelope gene, and 2 commercially available Panther System assays targeting open reading frame 1ab. Positive percent agreement (PPA) of pooled versus individual testing ranged from 71.7% to 82.6% for pools of 8 and from 82.9% to 100.0% for pools of 4. We developed and validated an independent stochastic simulation model to estimate effects of dilution on PPA and efficiency of a 2-stage pooled real-time reverse transcription PCR testing algorithm. PPA was dependent on the proportion of tests with positive results, cycle threshold distribution, and assay limit of detection.

We herein report a large Chinese family presented with phenotypic variability involving thrombocytopenia and/or giant platelets. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the proband and one of his affected brothers identified a potentially pathogenic c.952C>T heterozygous variant in the TUBB1 gene. This p.R318W 1-tubulin variant was also identified in three additional siblings and five members of the next generation. These findings were consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Moreover, impaired platelet agglutination in response to ristocetin was detected in the patient's brother. Half of the family members harboring the p.R318W mutation displayed significantly decreased external release of p-selectin by stimulated platelets. The p.R318W 1-tubulin mutation was identified for the first time in a Chinese family with congenital macrothrombocytopenia using WGS as an unbiased sequencing approach. Affected individuals within the family demonstrated impaired platelet aggregation and/or release functions.

This can lead not only to new treatments and understanding, but also to recognition of novel phenotypes. Here, we apply a collection of mathematical techniques (empirical dynamics), which infer mechanistic networks in a model-free manner from longitudinal data, to hematopoiesis. Our study consists of three subjects with markers for cyclic thrombocytopenia, in which multiple cells and proteins undergo abnormal oscillations. One subject has atypical markers and may represent a rare phenotype. Our analyses support this contention, and also lend new evidence to a theory for the cause of this disorder. Simulations of an intervention yield encouraging results, even when applied to patient data outside our three subjects. These successes suggest that this blueprint has broader applicability in understanding and treating complex disorders.

Current diagnostic criteria for CTCL incorporate clinical and histopathologic findings as well as results of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene sequencing. Molecular interrogation of TCR genes, TRG and TRB, has provento be a critical tool for confirming diagnoses of CTCL and for disease tracking after initiation of therapy or after stem cell transplant. Methods for confirming a diagnosis of lymphoma in the absence of TCR gene clonality are lacking. We present two patients with CTCL with pathogenic somatic mutations in the absence of TRG and TRB clonality.CASE PRESENTATIONS: Case 1: A 38-year-old male had a 19-year history of a diffuse skin rash with papulosquamous, granulomatous, and verrucous features and progressive ulcerated plaques and tumors demonstrating an atypical CD4+ T-cell infiltrate expression perforin on histopathology. No evidence for T-cell clonality was detected by conventional PCR of 6 biopsies or by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 14 biopsies. Somatic mutational profiling of a skin biopsy revealed pathogenic mutations in PIKC3D and TERT promoter hotspots, confirming the presence of a clonal process. Case 2: A 69-year-old male with a 13-year history of progressive, diffuse hypertrophic and eroded plaques showed an atypical CD4+ T-cell infiltrate with subset expression of TIA-1 and on histopathology. No TCR clonality was detected by TCR-NGS of 6 biopsies. Somatic mutational profiling of a skin biopsy detected a pathogenic mutation in TP53, confirming the presence of a clonal process.CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight how detection of pathogenic somatic mutations can confirma diagnosis of lymphoma in a clinically and histopathologically suspicious cutaneous lymphoid proliferation without detectable TCR clonality.

This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity.METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 30-day all-cause mortality.RESULTS: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; P = .04). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.6%), hypertension (30.6%), and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia 28/85 (32.9%) of patients, including 22/28 (78.6%) who required hospitalization. In models adjusted for age, RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including ICU admission (32.1 vs 14.0%; P = .04) and invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; P = .02). All 4 deaths occurred in individuals with detectable RNAemia. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity suggesting the potential utility of plasma viral testing as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19.

A test-based strategy that requires negative respiratory RT-PCR tests obtained after the resolution of symptoms. Alternatively, due to the limited availability of testing, many sites employ a symptom-based strategy that recommends excluding HCW from the workforce and keeping patients on contact precautions until a fixed period of time has elapsed from symptom recovery. The underlying assumption of the symptom-based strategy is that waiting for a fixed period of time is a surrogate for negative RT-PCR testing, which itself is a surrogate for the absence of shedding infectious virus.OBJECTIVES: To better understand the appropriate length of symptom based return to work and contact precaution strategies.STUDY DESIGN: We performed an observational analysis of 150 patients and HCW that transitioned from RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive to negative over the course of 2 months at a US academic medical center.RESULTS: We found that the average time to transition from RT-PCR positive to negative was 24 days after symptom onset and 10 % remained positive even 33 days after symptom onset. No difference was seen in HCW and patients.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest until definitive evidence of the length of infective viral shedding is obtained that the fixed length of time before returning to work or ceasing contract precautions be revised to over one-month.

As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing.METHODS: All patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for reporting.RESULTS: A total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all subsequent tests performed within this window.CONCLUSIONS: Two independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed. Although it is not possible to infer the clinical sensitivity of NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing using these data, they may be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and interpretation of this common testing modality.

The examination of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of HSCT patients and through the use of next generation nucleotide sequencing leads to the question of whether features of TCR repertoire reconstitution might reproducibly associate with GVHD.HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that the peripheral blood TCR repertoire of patients with steroid non-responsive, acute GVHD would be less diverse. We also hypothesized that patients with GVHD who shared HLA might also share common clones at the time of GVHD diagnosis, thereby potentially providing potential clinical indicators for treatment stratification. We further hypothesized that HSCT recipients with the same HLA mismatch might share a more similar TCR repertoire based on a potentially shared focus of alloreactive responses.METHOD: We studied two separate patient cohorts and two separate platforms to measure TCR repertoire. The first cohort of patients are from a multicenter, phase III, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial of patients who developed acute GVHD (NCT01002742). The second are samples from biobanks from two centers and the CIBMTR of patients who mismatched HSCT.CONCLUSION: There were no statistically significant differences in the TCR diversity of steroid responders and non-responders among patients with acute GVHD on the day of diagnosis. Most clones in the repertoire were unique to each patient, but a small number of clones were found to be both exclusive to, and shared, amongst GVHD non-responders. We were also able to show a strong correlation between the presence of VSS 20 and VSS29 and steroid responsiveness. Using the Bhattacharya coefficient, those patients who shared the same HLA mismatch were shown to be no more similar to one another than to those who had a completely different mismatch. Using two separate clinical cohorts and two separate platforms for analyzing the TCR repertoire, we have shown that the sampled human TCR repertoire is largely unique to each patient but showed glimmers of common clones of subsets of clones based on responsiveness to steroids in aGVHD on the day of diagnosis. These studies are informative for future strategies to assess for reproducible TCR responses in human alloreactivity and possible markers of GVHD responsiveness to therapy.

This process is typically performed manually by biocurators, geneticists, pathologists, and oncologists; however, this is a time-intensive, and inconsistent process amongst healthcare providers. We present the development of a feature matching algorithmic pipeline that identifies patients who meet eligibility criteria of precision medicine clinical trials via genetic biomarkers and apply it to patients undergoing treatment at the Stanford Cancer Center. This study demonstrates, through our patient eligibility screening algorithm that leverages clinical sequencing derived biomarkers with precision medicine clinical trials, the successful use of an automated algorithmic pipeline as a feasible, accurate and effective alternative to the traditional manual clinical trial curation.

Here we evaluate cases fitting such a diagnosis and find that the cases demonstrate a convincing and pervasive pattern consistent with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.Six cases of primary lymph node Merkel cell carcinoma and one case of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma at a bony site, all with unknown primary, were sequenced using a combination of whole-exome and targeted panel methods. Sequencing results were analyzed for the presence of an ultraviolet (UV) mutational signature or off-target detection of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV).Four of six primary lymph node cases were positive for a UV mutational signature, with the remaining two cases positive for off-target alignment of MCPyV. One case of neuroendocrine carcinoma occurring at a bony site was also positive for a UV mutational signature.We find no evidence to corroborate the existence of so-called primary Merkel cell carcinoma of lymph node.

We evaluated a novel, fully automated ex vivo DSS platform that uses high-throughput flow cytometry in 54 patients with newly diagnosed or treatment-refractory myeloid neoplasms to evaluate sensitivity (blast cytotoxicity and differentiation) to 74 US Food and Drug Administration-approved or investigational drugs and 36 drug combinations. After piloting the platform in 33 patients, we conducted a prospective feasibility study enrolling 21 patients refractory to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) to determine whether this assay could be performed within a clinically actionable time frame and could accurately predict clinical responses in vivo. When assayed for cytotoxicity, ex vivo drug sensitivity patterns were heterogeneous, but they defined distinct patient clusters with differential sensitivity to HMAs, anthracyclines, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and kinase inhibitors (P < .001 among clusters) and demonstrated synergy between HMAs and venetoclax (P < .01 for combinations vs single agents). In our feasibility study, ex vivo DSS results were available at a median of 15 days after bone marrow biopsy, and they informed personalized therapy, which frequently included venetoclax combinations, kinase inhibitors, differentiative agents, and androgens. In 21 patients with available ex vivo and in vivo clinical response data, the DSS platform had a positive predictive value of 0.92, negative predictive value of 0.82, and overall accuracy of 0.85. These data demonstrate the utility of this approach for identifying potentially useful and often novel therapeutic drugs for patients with myeloid neoplasms refractory to standard therapies.

The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use.Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test.Study design: The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen's kappa coefficient.Results: Overall percent agreement between the was 84.0% (95% interval [CI] 75.3 was (95% CI 80.5%) and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).Conclusion: Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.

Murine models of HCT are used to understand GVHD and T-cell reconstitution in GVHD target organs, most notably the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where the disease contributes most to patient mortality. T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing was used to measure T-cell reconstitution from the same donor graft (C57BL/6 H-2b) in the GI tract of different recipients across a spectrum of matching, from syngeneic (C57BL/6), to minor histocompatibility (MHC) and BALB/c (H-2d). Although the donor T-cell pools had highly similar TCR, the TCR repertoire after HCT was very specific to recipients in each experiment independent of geography. A single invariant natural killer T clone was identifiable in every recipient group and was enriched in syngeneic recipients according to clonal count and confirmatory flow cytometry. Using a novel cluster analysis of the TCR repertoire, we could classify recipient groups based only on their CDR3 size distribution or TCR repertoire relatedness. Using a method for evaluating the contribution of common TCR motifs to relatedness, we found that reproducible sets of clones were associated with specific recipient groups within each experiment and that relatedness did not necessarily depend on the most common clones in allogeneic recipients. This finding suggests that TCR reconstitution is highly stochastic and likely does not depend on the evaluation of the most expanded TCR clones in any individual recipient but instead depends on a complex polyclonal architecture.

It is, however, unknown which features of the serological response may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 983 longitudinal plasma samples from 79 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 175 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Within this cohort, 25 patients died of their illness. Higher ratios of IgG antibodies targeting S1 or RBD domains of spike compared to nucleocapsid antigen were seen in outpatients who had mild illness versus severely ill patients. Plasma antibody increases correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, but antibody responses in acute illness were insufficient to predict inpatient outcomes. Pseudovirus neutralization assays and a scalable ELISA measuring antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interaction were well correlated with patient IgG titers Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including IgG, progressively decreased during observation up to five months post-infection.

While studies have demonstrated the utility of cfDNA from plasma, cfDNA from other body fluids remains underexplored.METHODS: We evaluated the molecular features and clinicopathologic correlates of cfDNA from serous body cavity fluids by performing hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing supernatants provided a median cfDNA concentration of 10.3ng/L. Notably, all effusions were sequenced successfully to a median depth >1000*, revealing a broad range of genetic alterations including single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, amplifications, and fusions. Specifically, pathogenic alterations were identified in all malignant fluids (13/13), all fluids suspicious for malignancy (2/2), and 1 benign fluid (1/6) from a patient with metastatic cancer. To validate our findings, we examined matching results from 11 patients who underwent additional testing using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. In 8 patients, the paired results between FFPE and supernatant testing were concordant, whereas in the remaining 3 patients, supernatant analysis identified additional variants likely associated with resistance to targeted therapies. Additional comparison between FFPE and supernatant testing showed no difference in DNA concentration (P=.5), depth of coverage (P=.6), or allele frequency of pathogenic mutations (P=.7).CONCLUSION: cfDNA isolated from serous body cavity fluids represents a promising source of genomic input for targeted NGS.

Some patients exhibit a prozone effect on LAC testing. Antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies may provide a mechanism for both hemorrhage and prozone effect. Our goal was to evaluate whether antibody specificities, isotypes, and titers were associated with LAC prozone effect, factor II levels, hemorrhage, and thrombosis.METHODS: Patients with prozone effect noted on LAC testing were entered into a database over 3 years. Factor II activity and aPS/PT antibody testing were performed when a sufficient residual sample was available.RESULTS: All patients with LAC prozone effect and antibody testing were positive for at least 1 class of aPS/PT antibodies. In addition, aPS/PT IgG titers were significantly associated with thrombosis and significantly inversely associated with factor II levels.CONCLUSIONS: In prozone effect patients, aPS/PT antibodies are associated with LAC prozone effect as well as thrombosis and decreased factor II levels.

Traditional bulk analysis can only provide average variant allele frequencies of the targeted genes across all sampled cells. It fails to resolve mutational co-occurrences and may miss rare cancer cells. Genome analysis at the single cell level offers the opportunity to more fully resolve clonal architecture. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sampled from acute myeloid leukemia patients longitudinally and single-cell DNA sequencing libraries were generated with a novel droplet-based microfluidics approach. Molecular profiling of single nucleotide variants across thousands of cells revealed genetic chimerism in patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Importantly, hierarchical clustering analysis of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) uncovered a distinct oncogenic clone of cells mutated tumor-suppressor and/or oncogene(s). This novel single-cell DNA sequencing approach enabled precise monitoring of engraftment and revealed clonal evolution of oncogenic cells during the progression and treatment of the disease.

In situ lesions with indolent behavior have not been described to date. We have identified 2 cases of in situ B-cell neoplasms with MYC rearrangements to 4 lymphoid follicles in otherwise healthy individuals and without clinical progression despite minimal intervention (surgical only). Morphologically similar to systemic HGBCLs, the low power view of these lesions showed a starry sky pattern with numerous mitotic figures. High power imaging demonstrated these cells to be medium-large in size with irregular nuclear contours, immature chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Immunophenotypically these cells were light chain restricted, positive for CD20, CD10, c-Myc, and dim or negative for BCL2 with a Ki67 proliferative index of >95%. By fluorescence in situ hybridization studies, we detected MYC translocations in these cells but no rearrangements in BCL2 or BCL6. Microdissection of neoplastic cells in these patients followed by targeted next-generation sequencing identified a mutation in MYC, D2N, and an indel in TNFRSF14. Mutations in ID3 or TCF3 were not identified. Although rare, these lesions should be separated from HGBCLs involving follicles but with systemic spread which has been previously described. Unlike systemic lymphomas with MYC gene rearrangements, these in situ B-cell neoplasms with MYC rearrangements did not require systemic therapy and no progression has been seen in either patient beyond 1 year (29 and 16mo). Our work offers pathologic and biologic insight into the early process of B-cell neoplasia.

The performance characteristics of tests for PFD, and the level of evidence that these tests detect bleeding problems, are important issues to determine where tests are useful for diagnostic or correlative purposes, or research only uses. Platelet aggregation assays, and quantitative analysis of platelet dense granule numbers, are tests with good performance characteristics that detect abnormalities associated with increased bleeding in a significant proportion of individuals referred for PFD investigations. Lumiaggregometry estimates of platelet adenosine triphosphate release show greater variability which limits the diagnostic usefulness. Diagnostic laboratories report that fiscal and other constraints, including a lack of high-quality evidence, limit their ability to offer an expanded test menu for PFD.CONCLUSION: PFD are clinically important bleeding disorders that remain challenging for diagnostic laboratories to investigate. While some PFD tests are well validated for diagnostic purposes, gaps in scientific evidence and resource limitations influence diagnostic laboratory decisions on which PFD tests to offer.

Diagnostic criteria include the following: persistent thrombocytosis of the spliceosome factor 3b subunit (SF3B1) mutation. It is unclear if anemia should be a required criterion for this diagnosis as cases which show all other features of MDS/MPN-RS-T but without anemia exist.METHODS: We searched for borderline cases of MDS/MPN-RS-T in which refractory anemia was absent at diagnosis in two major academic institutes.RESULTS: Three cases without anemia were identified. These cases all showed other classic morphologic and clinical features of MDS/MPN-RS-T, including thrombocytosis, mutations.CONCLUSION: Given these findings, the requirement of refractory anemia as a diagnostic criterion for MDS/MPN-RS-T should be re-evaluated.

Utilizing a clinically validated 130-gene exon-sequencing assay, we identified recurrent pathogenic PIK3CA (p. KRAS (p.G12D) variants in three of four (75%) of the cases. In addition, an APC variant (P.S2310X), a TP53 variant (p.R273C), and a MYC amplification event were identified. The only CCA case without either PIK3CA or KRAS variants has a distinct pathogenesis through BK virus, demonstrated by positive BK virus PCR and SV40 immunohistochemistry. The novel finding of recurrent variants in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway provides not only insights into oncogenesis but also potential clinical therapeutic targets for patients with clear cell adenocarcinoma of the urinary tract.

The Cancer Genome Atlas identified hypermutated CRCs with somatic mutations in DNA polymerase (POLE) with mutation burdens exceeding that of MMR-deficient CRCs.To identify the morphologic, immunophenotypic and molecular features of POLE mutated CRCs, 63 consecutive MMR-intact CRCs were evaluated by Sanger sequencing for POLE exonuclease domain mutations in exons 9, 11, 13 and 14 and confirmed by next generation sequencing. Tumor immune microenvironment and immunoscores were assessed using immunohistochemistry detect MMR-intact primary and 1 MMR-intact metastasis) harbored POLE mutations in amino acid 286 in exon 9 (p.P286R) or exon 13 (p.V411L). POLE mutated CRCs arose in the transverse colon and rectum, were male-predominant, younger, and showed increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immune cells at the tumor-stromal interface. The patient with metastatic POLE mutated CRC was placed on PD-1 inhibitor treatment with marked and sustained response. These data indicate that POLE mutated CRCs have hypermutated phenotypes despite MMR-intact status, with mutation burdens higher than that in microsatellite unstable CRCs. Given the recent approval for treatment of microsatellite unstable cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors, assessment of POLE status may help guide therapeutic decisions for hypermutated tumors with intact MMR that would otherwise be missed by routine testing.

To model these leukemias, we applied clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing to induce MLL chromosomal rearrangements in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells purified from umbilical cord blood. Electroporation of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing chemically modified synthetic single guide RNAs and purified Cas9 protein induced translocations between chromosomes 9 and 11 [t(9;11)] at an efficiency >1%. Transplantation of gene-edited cells into immune-compromised mice rapidly induced acute leukemias of different lineages and often with multiclonal origins dictated by the duration of in vitro culture prior to transplantation. Breakpoint junction sequences served as biomarkers to monitor clonal selection and progression in culture and in vivo. High-dimensional cell surface and intracellular protein analysis (CyTOF) revealed that gene-edited leukemias recapitulated disease-specific protein expression observed in human patients showed that MLL-rearranged (MLLr) mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MPALs) were more (AMLs) than to acute lymphoblastic efficient generation of MLL chromosomal translocations in primary human blood stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 reliably models human acute MLLr leukemia and provides an experimental platform for basic and translational studies of leukemia biology and therapeutics.

We conducted a study to assess the performance of whole-blood impedance aggregometry (WBIA) as a simple and rapid HIT functional assay.Platelet factor 4 (PF4)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, WBIA, and SRA were tested on 70 patients suspected of having HIT. Patients with a 4Ts score of 4 or more, positive PF4/IgG, and positive SRA were considered HIT positive; others were designated HIT negative.WBIA had 85.7% (6/7) sensitivity and 98.4% (61/62) specificity, which were not statistically different compared with SRA. Sixty-two of 70 patients had concordant results (five positive and 57 negative) by both WBIA and SRA. Eight discordant cases revealed the importance of recognizing donor effect, interferences, and the presence of heparin-independent or non-heparin-dependent antibodies in functional assays.Implementation of WBIA could facilitate timely diagnosis and management of HIT.

However, a principal challenge for genetic assays from tumors is the fragmented and chemically damaged state of DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. From highly fragmented DNA and RNA there is no current technology for generating long-range DNA sequence data as is required to detect genomic structural variation or long-range genotype phasing. We have developed a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture approach for FFPE samples that we call \"Fix-C\", which is similar in concept to Hi-C. Fix-C enables structural variation detection from archival FFPE samples. This method was applied to 15 clinical adenocarcinoma and sarcoma positive control specimens spanning a broad range of tumor purities. In this panel, Fix-C analysis achieves a 90% concordance rate with FISH assays - the current clinical gold standard. Additionally, novel structural variation undetected by other methods could be identified and long-range chromatin configuration information recovered from these FFPE samples harboring highly degraded DNA. This powerful approach will enable detailed resolution of global genome rearrangement events during cancer progression from FFPE material and inform the development of targeted molecular diagnostic assays for patient care.

However, very low efficiency of translocations and lack of markers for translocated cells serve as barriers to their characterization and model development. Here, we used transcription activator-like effector nucleases to generate t(9;11) chromosomal reciprocal AF9-MLL fusion products in CD34+ human cord blood cells. Selected cytokine combinations enabled monoclonal outgrowth and immortalization of initially rare translocated cells, which were distinguished by elevated MLL target gene expression, high surface CD9 expression, and increased colony-forming ability. Subsequent transplantation into immune-compromised mice induced myeloid leukemias within 48 weeks, whose pathologic and molecular features extensively overlap with de novo patient MLL-rearranged leukemias. No secondary pathogenic mutations were revealed by targeted exome sequencing and whole genome RNA-sequencing analyses, suggesting the genetic sufficiency of t(9;11) translocation for leukemia development from human HSPCs. Thus, genome editing enables modeling of human acute MLL-rearranged leukemia in vivo, reflecting the genetic simplicity of this disease, and provides an experimental platform for biological and disease-modeling applications.

We present a case of low-grade serous carcinoma with transformation to carcinosarcoma on recurrence in the lymph node. Identical BRAF V600E and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutations were identified in both the original and recurrent tumor. Given that telomerase reverse transcriptase promotor mutations are thought to play a role in progression of other tumor types, the function of telomerase reverse transcriptase mutations in BRAF mutated low-grade serous carcinoma deserves investigation.

MCD can be further subtyped based on human of UCD, an associated follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) may be seen. Although numerous reports of the clinical and histologic features of UCD, MCD, and FDCS exist, an understanding of the genetic and epigenetic landscape of these rare diseases is lacking. Given this paucity of knowledge, we analyzed 15 cases of UCD and 3 cases of iMCD by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS; 405 genes) and 3 of hyaline 1 iMCD and 1 UCD case; the iMCD case also had a somatic DNMT3A L295Q mutation. This iMCD patient also showed clinicopathologic features consistent with a specific subtype known as 1 case of UCD-HVV showed amplification of the cluster of histone genes on chromosome 6p. FDCS associated with UCD-HVV showed mutations and copy number changes in known oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and chromatin structural-remodeling proteins.

We describe a patient presenting with clinicopathologic features of both chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). The bone marrow demonstrated a myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia and aggregates of atypical mast cells. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a t(13;14)(q12;q32), which was subsequently molecularly characterized as a novel TRIP11-FLT3 rearrangement. A KIT D816V mutation was also identified. The patient rapidly transformed to T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and expired shortly after diagnosis. This is the fifth FLT3 fusion gene described in the literature; the presence of both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms implicates involvement of an early hematopoietic by FLT3. We suggest that leukemias and lymphomas with FLT3 fusion genes exhibit similar clinicopathologic features to, and should be included in, the WHO category of \"Myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, or with PCM1-JAK2.\" View details for [PubMedID 29025582](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29025582) View details for [DOI 10.1056/NEJMc1701072](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1701072) View details for [PubMedID 28514606](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28514606) View details for [Web of Science ID 000402838000083](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000402838000083) View details for [Web of Science ID 000402838000064](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000402838000064) View details for [Web of Science ID 000402838000082](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000402838000082) While PCR-based genotyping methods abound in molecular testing for lung cancer therapy, these approaches may not provide the robust sensitivity to detect accurate genotypes in a variable cancer genomic background.Here, we describe a study of a clinical tumor specimen containing a novel somatic single nucleotide variant that caused allele drop-out in EGFR L858R genotyping, resulting in a false-negative interpretation and impacting patient clinical management.We demonstrate that a subsequent unbiased next-generation sequencing approach correctly identified the driver mutation, and therefore may be more reliable for somatic variant detection.These findings magnify the potential pitfalls of PCR amplification-based approaches and stress the importance of unbiased and sensitive molecular testing strategies for therapeutic marker detection as molecular testing becomes the standard for determining clinical management of cancer patients.

To better understanding the potential clinical utility and limitations of this application outside of MRD, we developed a BIOMED-2 primer-based NGS method and characterized its performance in controls and patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic transplant. For controls and patients with GVHD, replicate sequencing of the same T-cell receptor (TRB) libraries was highly reproducible. Higher variability was observed in sequencing of different TRB libraries made from the same DNA stock. Variability was increased in patients with GVHD compared with controls; patients with GVHD also had lower diversity than controls. In the T-cell repertoire of a healthy person, approximately 99.6% of the CDR3 clones were in low abundance, with frequency <10(-3). A single library could identify >93% of the clones with frequency 10(-3) in the repertoire. Sequencing in duplicate increased the average detection rate to >97%. This work demonstrates that NGS reliably and robustly characterizes TRB populations in healthy individuals and patients with GVHD with frequency 10(-3) and provides a methodologic framework for applying NGS immune repertoire methods to clinical testing applications beyond MRD.

Similar to other studies, APL showed an increased incidence of DIC (P < 0.01) compared to other subtypes of acute leukemia. Surprisingly, the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear was not a statistically significant indicator of DIC, sensitivity of 36% and specificity of 89%. Finally, the presence of DIC was not a significant indicator of poorer prognosis amongst all patients with AML.Overall we identify elevated D-dimer concentrations 19 000 ng/mL FEU are a sensitive indicator of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 92% in the subtyping of acute leukemias, and that the presence of schistocytes in peripheral blood smears is not a diagnostically sensitive screening test for DIC with a sensitivity of 36%.

Although fine-needle aspirates are adequate substrates for high-throughput sequencing, the suitability of malignant body fluids remains largely unexplored. Herein, we investigated the adequacy and utility of performing targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on malignant effusions from patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Thirty-two effusion samples that were submitted for hybrid capture-based NGS using a clinically validated solid tumor genotyping panel were examined. All cases showed 5% tumor cellularity; however, 28 (88%) provided sufficient DNA for NGS (1 ng/L). The sequencing reads showed satisfactory quality control statistics, and the variant allele frequencies were correlated with tumor cellularity. Furthermore, pathogenic or likely pathogenic genomic alterations were identified in 26/28 samples (93%), whereas clinically actionable alterations were present in 18 (64%). Notably, nine patients had additional molecular testing performed on preceding/subsequent biopsies, and the results across multiple samples were compared. In two patients, the NGS-based fluid analysis identified clinically actionable alterations that were not detected by other hotspot testing. In four patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, malignant fluid sequencing confirmed driver alterations from prior testing and revealed new resistance mechanisms. Hence, given adequate DNA input and tumor cellularity, comprehensive genomic profiling of malignant effusions may be used to establish mutational status at diagnosis and inform treatment resistance during targeted therapy.

These lymphomas occur predominantly in the pediatric population and show features distinct from their more common counterparts in adults: adult-type follicular lymphoma and adult-type nodal marginal we report a detailed whole-exome deep sequencing analysis of a cohort of pediatric-type follicular lymphomas and pediatric marginal zone lymphomas. This analysis revealed a recurrent somatic variant encoding p.Lys66Arg in the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) in 3 of 6 cases (50%) of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma. This specific point mutation was not detected in pediatric marginal zone lymphoma or in adult-type follicular lymphoma. Additional somatic point mutations in pediatric-type follicular lymphoma were observed in genes involved in transcription, intracellular signaling, and cell proliferation. In pediatric marginal zone lymphoma, no recurrent mutation was identified; however, somatic point mutations were observed in genes involved in cellular adhesion, cytokine regulatory elements, and cellular proliferation. A somatic variant in AMOTL1, a recurrently mutated gene in splenic marginal zone lymphoma, was also identified in a case of pediatric marginal zone lymphoma. The overall non-synonymous mutational burden was low in both pediatric-type follicular lymphoma and pediatric marginal zone lymphoma (4.6 mutations per exome). Altogether, these findings support a distinctive genetic basis for pediatric-type follicular lymphoma and pediatric marginal zone lymphoma when compared with adult subtypes and to one another. Moreover, identification of a recurrent point mutation in IRF8 provides insight into a potential driver mutation in the pathogenesis of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma with implications for novel diagnostic or therapeutic strategies.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 24 June 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.102.

However, the typical genetic risk factors in populations of European descent are nearly absent in African Americans, and population-specific genetic factors influencing the higher VTE rate are not well characterized.We performed a candidate gene analysis on an exome-sequenced African American family with recurrent VTE and identified a variant in Protein S (PROS1) V510M (rs138925964). We assessed the population impact of PROS1 V510M using a multicenter African American cohort of 306 cases with VTE compared to 370 controls. Additionally, we compared our case cohort to a background population cohort of 2203 African Americans in the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP).In the African American family with recurrent VTE, we found prior laboratories for our cases indicating low free Protein S levels, providing functional support for PROS1 V510M as the causative mutation. Additionally, this variant was significantly enriched in the VTE cases of our multicenter was also enriched in our VTE case cohort compared to African Americans in the ESP cohort (Fisher's Exact Test, P=0.010, OR=2.28, 95% CI: 1.26-4.10).We found a PROS1 V510M, in an African American family with VTE and clinical laboratory abnormalities in Protein S. Additionally, we found that this variant conferred increased risk of VTE in a case-control study of African Americans. In the ESP cohort, the variant is nearly absent in ESP European descent subjects (n=3, allele frequency: 0.03%). Additionally, in 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data, the variant only appears in African descent populations. Thus, PROS1 V510M is a population-specific genetic risk factor for VTE in African Americans.

Rituximab and three cycles of dexamethasone (4R+3Dex) improve treatment responses and short-term disease control but long-term outcome is not known. In adults with ITP treated with 4R+3D, we sought long-term outcome and associated prognostic variables. Forty-nine adults treated at Weill-Cornell received 4R+3Dex. Their clinical characteristics were reviewed. Duration was median time to treatment failure; Kaplan-Meier estimates were developed. Vbeta Tcell receptor (VBTCR) repertoire was obtained after treatment in 36 patients. Patients were adults with ITP 18-64 years old, median age 37. The 27 females were twice as likely to have an ongoing response to 4R+3Dex (44.1%) as males (19.6%; P=0.009). For ITP duration <12 months, 52.7% of patients had continuing responses to 4R+3Dex compared to 15.3% of patients with diagnosis >12 months (P=0.02). Females with ITP duration of <12 months had continuing responses in 78.6%, compared to males with <12 months duration of ITP (21.2%). For patients with disease duration <12 months, 67% of females had continuing responses, compared to 31% of males (P=0.004). Post-treatment polyclonal VBTCR was seen in 9/10 continuing responders (six female, three male) but only 13/26 relapsers/nonresponders (P=0.068). Durable remissions after treatment with 4R+3Dex were more frequent in female patients with <12 months of ITP duration and those with polyclonal VBTCR after treatment, emphasizing the roles of duration of disease, gender and T cells in chronic ITP. Differences in pathophysiology of ITP by gender and by duration of ITP require further study. Am. J. Hematol. 91:907-911, 2016. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We recruited a web-based cohort of 726 individuals with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis and Using a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array with custom probes for the JAK2 V617F mutation (V617F), we identified 497 individuals (0.2%) among the population controls who were V617F carriers. We performed a combined GWAS of the MPN cases plus V617F carriers in the control population (n = 1223) vs the remaining controls who were noncarriers for V617F (n = 252140). For these MPN cases plus V617F carriers, we replicated the germ line JAK2 46/1 haplotype (rs59384377: odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, P = 6.6 10(-89)), previously associated with V617F-positive MPN. We also identified genome-wide significant associations in the TERT gene (rs7705526: OR = 1.8, P = 1.1 10(-32)), in SH2B3 (rs7310615: OR = 1.4, P = 3.1 10(-14)), and upstream of TET2 (rs1548483: OR = 2.0, P = 2.0 10(-9)). These associations were confirmed in a separate replication cohort of 446 V617F carriers vs 169021 noncarriers. In a joint analysis of the combined GWAS and replication results, we identified additional genome-wide significant predisposition alleles associated with CHEK2, ATM, PINT, and GFI1B All SNP ORs were similar for MPN patients and controls who were V617F carriers. These data indicate that the same germ line variants endow individuals with a predisposition not only to MPN, but also to JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis, a more common phenomenon that may foreshadow the development of an overt neoplasm.

However, bleeding due to lupus anticoagulant-hypoprothrombinemia syndrome is a rare but well-described manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome. The association of acute acquired hypoprothrombinemia is caused by a lupus anticoagulant's specificity to prothrombin, which results in clearance of prothrombin and bleeding due to hypoprothrombinemia (usually<10% of normal). Severe life-threatening bleeding is most frequently reported in children with systemic lupus erythematosus or in healthy children after viral infection. In such cases, steroid therapy is usually effective in controlling the bleeding problems and improving prothrombin levels.We report one pediatric patient with a lupus anticoagulant who had acute hemorrhagic diathesis.The diagnosis in this case was complicated by the presence of a prozone effect in lupus anticoagulant testing. The prozone effect (also known as hook effect) refers to situations where very high concentrations of antibody mask detection, typically in antigen-antibody reactions, which depend on visualization of agglutination. Decreasing the antibody/antigen ratio results in detectable antigen-antibody complexes.We report for the first time a variation on this theme in a patient with a lupus anticoagulant-type antiphospholipid antibody and hypoprothrombinemia, which corrected with immunosuppression and restoration of normal prothrombin levels.

Seven cases that demonstrated centroblast-predominant isolated follicles and absent BCL2 staining in otherwise-normal lymph nodes were studied. Four of seven cases showed clonal B-cell proliferations amid a polyclonal B cell background; all cases lacked the IGH-BCL2 translocation and BCL2 protein expression. Although three patients had invasive breast carcinoma at other sites, none were associated with systemic lymphoma up to 44 months after diagnosis. The immunoarchitectural features of these highly unusual cases raise the question of whether a predominance of centroblasts and/or absence of BCL2 expression could represent a precursor lesion or atypical reactive phenomenon.

The clonal architecture of CXCR4(WHIM) mutations remains to be delineated. We developed highly sensitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) assays for detecting the most CXCR4(WHIM) and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) patients not revealed by Sanger sequencing. By combined AS-PCR and Sanger sequencing, WM, IgM MGUS and marginal zone lymphoma patients, respectively, but no chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, non-IgM MGUS patients or healthy donors. Cancer cell fraction analysis in WM and IgM MGUS patients showed CXCR4(S338X) mutations were primarily subclonal, with highly variable clonal distribution (median 351%, range 12-975%). Combined AS-PCR and Sanger sequencing revealed multiple CXCR4(WHIM) mutations in many individual WM patients, including homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations validated by deep RNA sequencing. The findings show that CXCR4(WHIM) mutations are more common in WM than previously revealed, and are primarily subclonal, supporting their acquisition after MYD88(L265P) in WM oncogenesis. The presence of multiple CXCR4(WHIM) mutations within individual WM patients may be indicative of targeted CXCR4 genomic instability.

This review describes many of the most fascinating features of FVLeiden , including background features, mechanisms of hypercoagulability, the founder mutation concept, the \"FVLeiden paradox,\" synergistic interaction with other thrombotic risk factors, the intertwined relationship between FVLeiden and APC resistance testing, and other, uncommon mutations implicated in causing APC resistance. In addition, there are several conditions where laboratory tests for APC resistance and FVLeiden are or can be discrepant, including lupus anticoagulants, anticoagulants such as direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran, argatroban, and bivalirudin) and rivaroxaban, as well as pseudohomozygous, pseudo-wildtype, liver transplant, and bone marrow transplant patients. The laboratory test error rate for FVLeiden is also presented.

Of these cases, 79% showed at least one nonsynonymous mutation, and cases of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities showed a lower frequency of mutations versus AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P<0.001). Mutational analysis further demonstrated that TP53 mutations are associated with complex karyotype AML, whereas ASXL1 and U2AF1 mutations are associated with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Furthermore, U2AF1 mutations were specifically associated with trilineage morphologic dysplasia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that U2AF1 and TP53 mutations are associated with absence of clinical remission, poor overall survival (OS), and poor disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.0001), whereas TET2 and ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor OS (P<0.03). In multivariate analysis, U2AF1 and TP53 mutations retained independent prognostic significance in OS and DFS, respectively. Our results demonstrate unique relationships between mutations in AML, clinicopathologic prognosis, subtype categorization, and morphologic dysplasia.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 21 November 2014; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2014.160.

CXCR4(WHIM) mutations confer in vitro resistance to ibrutinib.We performed a prospective study of ibrutinib in 63 symptomatic patients with Waldenstrm's macroglobulinemia who had received at least one previous treatment, and we investigated the effect of MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations on outcomes. Ibrutinib at a daily dose of 420 mg was administered orally until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxic effects.After the patients received ibrutinib, median serum IgM levels decreased from 3520 mg per deciliter to 880 mg per deciliter, median hemoglobin levels increased from 10.5 g per deciliter to 13.8 g per deciliter, and bone marrow involvement decreased from 60% to 25% (P<0.01 for all comparisons). The median time to at least a minor response was 4 weeks. The overall response rate was 90.5%, and the major response rate was 73.0%; these rates were highest among patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WT) (with WT indicating wild-type) (100% overall response rate and 91.2% major response rate), followed by patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WHIM) (85.7% and 61.9%, respectively) and patients with MYD88(WT)CXCR4(WT) (71.4% and 28.6%). The estimated 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates among all patients were 69.1% and 95.2%, respectively. Treatment-related toxic effects of grade 2 or higher included neutropenia (in 22% of the patients) and thrombocytopenia (in 14%), which were more common in heavily pretreated patients; postprocedural bleeding (in 3%); epistaxis associated with the use of fish-oil supplements (in 3%); and atrial fibrillation associated with a history of arrhythmia (5%).Ibrutinib was highly active, associated with durable responses, and safe in pretreated patients with Waldenstrm's macroglobulinemia.

Bright expression of CD45 was defined as more than 20% of CD117+ mast cells showing brighter CD45 expression than the average expression level of lymphocytes.Mast cells with bright CD45 expression were seen in 26 systemic mastocytosis cases and three bone marrows uninvolved by systemic mastocytosis (sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 96%). CD25 alone had a greater sensitivity (100%) but lower specificity (93%) compared with bright CD45 for identifying abnormal mast cells, while CD2 alone had lower sensitivity but higher specificity. To reach a specificity of 100%, CD25 together with bright CD45 on mast cells was the optimal combination to detect cases of systemic mastocytosis.A combination of bright CD45 and CD25 appears to specifically identify abnormal mast cells in cases of systemic mastocytosis. Further studies will be necessary to confirm these results.

Here, we describe a rare case of pFL that showed morphologic features partially overlapping with progressive transformation of germinal centers and reactive follicular hyperplasia. As typical of pFL, B follicles did not express B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2). However, this case showed additional distinctive abnormal findings, which contributed to the diagnosis: (1) diffuse and uniform staining of immunoglobulin M (IgM) on cells within and outside of follicles, (2) abnormally dim expression of CD21 on follicular dendritic and (3) expression of human germinal center-associated lymphoma (HGAL) and LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) on B cells in interfollicular and follicular areas. This case demonstrates the utility of these abnormal features, which can be seen in adult- or usual-type follicular lymphoma, in the diagnosis of pFL. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the significance of these findings in other cases of pFL.

Bone marrow ALL burden 10(-4) after induction predicts subsequent relapse. Likewise, MRD 10(-4) in bone marrow before initiation of conditioning for allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) predicts transplantation failure. Current methods for MRD quantification in ALL are not sufficiently sensitive for use with peripheral blood specimens and have not been broadly implemented in the management of adults with ALL. Consensus-primed immunoglobulin (Ig), Tcell receptor (TCR) amplification and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) permit use of a standardized algorithm for all patients and can detect leukemia at 10(-6) or lower. We applied the LymphoSIGHT HTS platform (Sequenta Inc., South San Francisco, CA) to quantification of MRD in 237 samples from 29 adult Bcell ALL patients before and after allo-HCT. Using of patients. blood samples, MRD 10(-6) had 100% positive predictive value for relapse with median lead time of 89days (HR, 14; 95% CI, 4.7 to 44, P<.0001). The use of HTS-based MRD quantification in adults with ALL offers a standardized approach with sufficient sensitivity to quantify leukemia MRD in peripheral blood. Use of this approach may identify a window for clinical intervention before overt relapse.

Laboratory tests to support clinical diagnosis are subdivided into functional, platelet activation assays, which lack standardization, or immunological assays, which have moderate specificity toward HIT. In this study, clinical performance of HITAlert, a novel in vitro diagnostic (IVD) registered platelet activation assay, was tested in a large cohort of HIT-suspected patients and compared with immunological assays.From 346 HIT-suspected patients (single center), clinical data pretest probability results, citrated platelet-poor plasmas, and sera were collected, allowing direct comparison of clinical observations with HITAlert results. HITAlert performance was compared with PF4 IgG ELISA (246 patients, three centers) and PF4 PaGIA (298 patients, single center).HITAlert showed high sensitivity (88.2%) and specificity (99.1%) when compared with clinical diagnosis. Agreement of HITAlert with PF4 ELISA- and PF4 PaGIA-positive patients is low and while agreement with PF4 IgG ELISA- and patients is very high (98.1 and 99.1%, respectively).HITAlert performance is excellent when compared with clinical HIT diagnosis, making it a suitable assay for rapid testing of platelet activation due to anticoagulant therapy.

It enables very large data sets to be gathered, whose interpretation and conversion into useful knowledge is only beginning. A challenge for modern healthcare systems and academic medical centers is to apply these new methods for the diagnosis of disease and the management of patient care without unnecessary delay, but also with appropriate evaluation of the quality of data and interpretation, as well as the clinical value of the insights gained. Most critically, the standards applied for evaluating these new laboratory data and ensuring that the results and their significance are clearly communicated to patients and their caregivers should be at least as rigorous as those applied to other kinds of medical tests. Here, we present an overview of conceptual and practical issues to be considered in planning for the integration of genomic methods or, in principle, any other type of \"omics\" testing into clinical care.

The primary myelofibrosis genome had a low somatic mutation rate, consistent with that observed in similar hematopoietic tumor genomes. Interfacing of whole-genome DNA sequence data with RNA expression data identified three somatic mutations of potential functional significance: a nonsense mutation in CARD6, implicated in modulation of NF-kappaB activation; a 19-base pair deletion involving a potential regulatory region in the 5'-untranslated region of BRD2, implicated in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control; and a non-synonymous point mutation in KIAA0355, an uncharacterized protein. Additional mutations in three genes (CAP2, SOX30, and MFRP) were also evident, albeit with no support for expression at the RNA level. Re-sequencing of these six genes in 178 patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis did not identify recurrent somatic mutations in these genes. Finally, we describe methods for reducing false-positive variant calls in the analysis of hematologic malignancies with a low somatic mutation rate.

We utilized an MRD-quantification method that amplifies immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) loci using consensus V and J segment primers followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS), enabling quantification with a detection limit of one CLL cell per million mononuclear cells. Using this IGH-HTS approach, we analyzed MRD patterns in over 400 samples from 40 CLL patients who underwent reduced-intensity allo-HCT. Nine patients relapsed within 12 months post-HCT. Of the 31 patients in remission at 12 months post-HCT, disease-free survival was 86% in patients with 20% in MRD 10(-4) (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-32; P<0.0001), with median follow-up of 36 months. Additionally, MRD predicted relapse at other time points, including 9, 18 and 24 months post-HCT. MRD doubling time <12 months with disease burden 10(-5) was associated with relapse within 12 months of MRD assessment in 50% of patients, and within 24 months in 90% of patients. This IGH-HTS method may facilitate routine MRD quantification in clinical trials.Leukemia advance online publication, 12 March 2013; doi:10.1038/leu.2013.52.

The mechanism of the disease has been extensively studied so that we now have a much improved understanding of the pathophysiology; however, the trigger of the autoimmunity remains unclear. More recently, oxidative stress was identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of ITP and provides a new hypothesis for the initiation of autoimmunity in patients with ITP. In this review, oxidative stress and its impact on autoimmunity, particularly ITP, will be covered.

Conventional clinical assays only evaluate 1 mutation at a time, and targeted tests are often constrained to identify only the most common mutations. Genome-wide or transcriptome-wide high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of clinical samples offers an opportunity to evaluate for all clinically significant mutations with a single test. Recently a \"desktop version\" of HTS has become available, but most of the experience to date is based on data obtained from high-quality DNA from frozen specimens. In this study, we demonstrate, as a proof of principle, that translocations in sarcomas can be diagnosed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue with desktop HTS. Using the first generation MiSeq platform, full transcriptome sequencing was performed on FFPE material from archival blocks of 3 synovial sarcomas, 3 myxoid liposarcomas, 2 Ewing sarcomas, and 1 clear cell sarcoma. Mapping the reads to the \"sarcomatome\" (all known 83 genes involved in translocations and mutations in sarcoma) and using a novel algorithm for ranking fusion candidates, the pathognomonic fusions and the exact breakpoints were identified in all cases of synovial sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and clear cell sarcoma. The Ewing sarcoma fusion gene was detectable in FFPE material only with a sequencing platform that generates greater sequencing depth. The results show that a single transcriptome HTS assay, from FFPE, has the potential to replace conventional molecular diagnostic techniques for the evaluation of clinically relevant mutations in cancer.

Here we review the clinical and pathologic features, which are required for an accurate diagnosis of an iT-LBP. We demonstrate specific criteria can be used to accurately diagnose iT-LBP, notably: (1) confluent groups of TdT+ T cells in a biopsy specimen, (2) relative preservation of surrounding normal lymphoid architecture, (3) TdT+ T cells without morphologic atypia, (4) absence of thymic epithelium, (5) nonclonal TdT+ T cells, (6) immunophenotype of developmentally normal immature thymic T cells, and (7) clinical evidence of indolence (follow-up >6 mo without progression).

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in combination with lenalidomide as front-line therapy for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Patients 60 years of age with untreated acute myeloid leukemia received azacitidine 75 mg/m2 for 7 days followed by escalating doses of lenalidomide daily for 21 days starting on day 8 of each cycle every 6 weeks. Patients received continued therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 12 cycles. Forty-two patients (median age, 74 years) were enrolled with equal distribution according to European LeukemiaNet risk. The overall response rate was 40% (rate of complete remission with or without complete recovery of blood counts = 28%). The median time to complete remission with or without complete recovery of blood counts was 12 weeks, and duration of this status was 28 weeks (range, 4 - >104 weeks). Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and a high score on the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index were negative predictors of response. Early death was noted in 17% of patients. Grades 3 toxicities were uncommon and most adverse events were gastrointestinal, fatigue and myelosuppression. In conclusion, a sequential combination of azacitidine plus lenalidomide has clinical activity in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and further studies of this combination are underway.

Following implementation of an anti-Xa method for heparin dosing protocols in our hospital, we became aware of many patients with discordant aPTT and anti-Xa values.To determine the frequency of discordant aPTT and anti-Xa values in a large cohort of hospitalized patients treated with UFH, as well as the demographics, coagulation status, indication for UFH, and clinical outcomes in this population.All aPTT and anti-Xa values from adults hospitalized between February and August 2009 at Stanford Hospital who were treated with UFH were analyzed. All samples were drawn simultaneously. A polynomial fit correlating aPTT and anti-Xa with a 99% confidence limit was designed. Paired aPTT/anti-Xa values were grouped according to whether the paired values fell within or outside of the concordant area. Patients were placed into groups based on concordance status, and clinical outcomes were assessed.A total of 2321 paired values from 539 patients were studied; 42% of data pairs had a high aPTT value relative to the anti-Xa value. Patients with elevated baseline prothrombin time/international normalized ratio or aPTT frequently demonstrated disproportionate relative prolongation of the aPTT. Patients with at least 2 consecutive high aPTT to anti-Xa values had increased 21-day major bleeding (9% vs 3%; p = 0.0316) and 30-day mortality (14% dead vs 5% dead at 30 days; p = 0.0202) compared with patients with consistently concordant values.aPTT and anti-Xa values are frequently discordant when used to measure UFH in hospitalized patients. A disproportionate prolongation of the aPTT relative to the anti-Xa was the most common discordant pattern in our study. Patients with relatively high aPTT to anti-Xa values appear to be at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Monitoring both aPTT and Xa values may have utility in managing such patients.

Conversely, indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferation mimics T-lymphoblastic lymphoma but consists of a proliferation of non-neoplastic TdT+ T cells, requiring no treatment. Recently, we identified several cases of indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferations in extrathymic lymphoid tissues: 1 in a patient suffering from Castleman disease (CD) associated with a follicular dendritic cell sarcoma/tumor, 1 in a patient with a history of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and 1 in association with acinic cell carcinoma. Interestingly, in the case of the patient with a history of AITL, these TdT+ T cells were seen in multiple anatomic sites over the span of 5 years. Here we review these 3 cases and extend our findings by demonstrating that TdT+ T-lymphoblastic populations are increased in lymph nodes of patients with CD (P=0.011), CD in association with follicular dendritic cell tumors, and AITL (P<0.01) compared with other T-cell or B-cell lymphomas or reactive lymph nodes. Finally, analysis of 352 nonhematolymphoid tumors including carcinomas, melanomas, and sarcomas demonstrates that TdT+ T cells are not increased in these tumors. Our studies not only present several detailed cases of indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferations, but also correlate these populations with specific hematologic diseases.

We hypothesized that prophylactic anti-B-cell therapy delivered 2 months after transplantation would decrease allogeneic donor B-cell immunity and possibly the incidence of cGVHD. Therefore, in the present study, patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 22) and mantle-cell lymphoma (n = 13) received a total lymphoid irradiation of 80 cGy for 10 days and antithymocyte globulin 1.5 mg/kg/d for 5 days. Rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was infused weekly on days 56, 63, 70, and 77 after transplantation. The incidence of acute GVHD was 6%. The cumulative incidence of cGVHD was 20%. Nonrelapse mortality was 3%. Rituximab treatment after allogeneic transplantation significantly reduced B-cell allogeneic immunity, with complete prevention of alloreactive H-Y Ab development in male patients with female donors (P = .01). Overall survival and freedom from progression at 4 years for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were 73% and 47%, respectively; for mantle-cell lymphoma patients, they and 53%, respectively.

The lymph node biopsy findings were interpreted as \"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorder consistent with infectious mononucleosis.\" No molecular studies were performed at that time. The patient was followed without treatment. Five months later, the patient again presented with fever, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. The lymph node biopsy showed features of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Molecular studies on this lymph node biopsy showed a clonal EBV population, although polymerase chain reaction studies failed to reveal a clonal B-cell or T-cell population. A concurrent bone marrow biopsy showed features consistent with hemophagocytic syndrome. He had elevated ferritin, soluble interleukin-2 receptors and persistent EBV viremia. The patient responded to Rituxan for a short period with undetectable EBV levels. Subsequent right cervical lymph node, liver, and jejunal biopsies showed involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and the patient expired soon thereafter.

In this phase-1 study, we determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the efficacy for sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide as remission induction and continuation therapy in elderly, previously untreated patients. We investigated the impact on global DNA methylation and bone marrow cytokines, and sought biological predictors of response. Eighteen patients were enrolled. The MTD was not reached. Median follow-up was 8.2 months (10.3 months for survivors). Common adverse events included fatigue, injection site reactions, constipation, nausea, pruritus and febrile neutropenia. Ten patients responded (56%), and the rate of complete remissions (CRs) or CRs with incomplete recovery of blood counts for evaluable patients was 44% (7/16). The median response duration was 6.2 months. DNA demethylation and changes in bone marrow cytokines were observed; responders had a unique cytokine profile and a trend towards lower methylation levels. Sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide was well tolerated with encouraging clinical and biological activity in previously untreated elderly AML patients. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00890929).

This study assessed whether the temozolomide dose can be tailored by MGMT promoter status and whether protracted, low-dose temozolomide can \"prime\" blasts in patients with unmethylated MGMT (unMGMT). Elderly patients with high-risk AML Patients with methylated MGMT (mMGMT) received temozolomide 200 mg/m(2) orally for 7 days every 4 weeks, while patients with unMGMT received temozolomide 100 mg/m(2) orally for 14 days followed by 200 mg/m(2) orally for 7 days every 6weeks. Of 36 patients (median age, 75 years), 31 (86%) had an unMGMT promoter. Overall response rate for the entire cohort was 36%. Patients with mMGMT and unMGMT had similar response rates (40% vs. 29%). Median duration of response and overall survival (OS) among responders were 29 and 35 weeks, respectively. Induction deaths (ID) occurred in 25% of patients, mostly caused by disease progression. Hematological toxicities were the most common adverse event. Toxicities were similar between patients on conventional versus protracted schedules. High HCT-CI scores were predictive of lower CR rate, higher ID, and shorter OS, while bone marrow blast count <50% at screening predicted for improved responses. Temozolomide, dosed according to MGMT methylation status, demonstrated modest clinical activity in elderly patients with AML, especially in those presenting with fewer comorbidities and low disease burden. The trial was registered on www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT00611247.

Detection of increasing minimal residual disease (MRD) following HCT may permit early intervention to prevent clinical relapse; however, MRD quantification remains an uncommon diagnostic test because of logistical and financial barriers to widespread use. Here we describe a method for quantifying CLL MRD using widely available consensus primers for amplification of all Ig heavy chain (IGH) genes in a mixture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for disease-specific IGH sequence quantification. To achieve accurate MRD quantification, we developed a systematic bioinformatic methodology to aggregate cancer clone sequence variants arising from systematic and random artifacts occurring during IGH-HTS. We then compared the sensitivity of IGH-HTS, flow cytometry, and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR for MRD quantification in 28 samples collected from 6 CLL patients following allogeneic HCT. Using amplimer libraries generated with consensus primers from patient blood samples, we demonstrate the sensitivity of IGH-HTS with 454 pyrosequencing to be 10(-5), with a high correlation between quantification by allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR and IGH-HTS (r = 0.85). From the same dataset used to quantify MRD, IGH-HTS also allowed us to profile IGH repertoire reconstitution after HCT-information not provided by the other MRD methods. IGH-HTS using consensus primers will broaden the availability of MRD quantification in CLL and other B cell malignancies, and this approach has potential for quantitative evaluation of immune diversification following transplant and nontransplant therapies.

Often the diagnosis is unclear as non-clonal expansions of LGLs commonly occur in reactive conditions. To better understand T-LGL leukemia, we performed a comprehensive clinicopathologic analysis of 85 patients with LGL expansions. Interestingly, distinct CD8+(dim)/CD57+ populations, seen by flow cytometry, were significantly associated with clonal T-LGL leukemia (P < 0.001) as well as neutropenia (median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.45 vs 3.19 10(9)/l; P = 0.0017). Furthermore, cases with distinct CD8+(dim)/CD57+ populations and monoclonal T cells had even lower ANCs (median ANC 1.41 10(9)/l; P = 0.001) compared with cases without these dual criteria. Additionally, complete or partial loss of CD5 expression was independently associated with clonal T-LGL leukemia (P<0.001) and neutropenia (median ANC 1.41 vs 2.70 10(9)/l; P = 0.002). This study describes specific immunophenotypic parameters to better define clonal cases of T-LGL leukemia associated with significant neutropenia.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of TOO-FRZ on a diverse collection of malignancies. We collected a diverse set of 49 malignancies. We classified each case into 1 of 4 groups: common morphology from a tissue type included in the TOO-FRZ assay (n=29), uncommon morphology from a tissue type included in the TOO-FRZ assay (n=10), tumor from a tissue type not included in the TOO-FRZ assay (n=3), and malignancies of unknown primary (n=7). We found strong diagnostic performance for common morphologies from tissue types on the TOO-FRZ [overall accuracy=26 of 29 (90%, 95% CI, 73% to 97%)], with perfect performance in all tissue types except gastric (0 of 2) and pancreatic (1 of 2) tissues. There was a significant decline in performance for uncommon morphologies from tissue types included in the TOO-FRZ assay [6 of 10 (60%) cases with an indeterminate result, 1 of 10 (10%) cases with an incorrect prediction, and 3 of 10 (30%) with a correct prediction] and for tumors from tissue types not included in the assay (incorrect prediction in 2 of 3 cases). For the 7 malignancies of unknown primary in our study set, the TOO-FRZ provided a likely clinically useful result in only 2 of 7 cases. These results provide an insight into the strengths and limitations of this molecular assay for the surgical pathologist, and our findings suggest future directions for research in this area.

The two VZV glycoproteins gE and gI form a heterodimer that mediates efficient cell-to-cell spread. Deletion of gI yields a small-plaque-phenotype virus, gI virus, which is avirulent in human skin using the xenograft model of VZV pathogenesis. In the present study, 10 mutant viruses were generated to determine which residues were required for the typical function of gI. Three phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain of gI were not required for VZV virulence in vivo. Two deletion mutants mapped a gE binding region in gI to residues 105 to 125. A glycosylation site, N116, in this region did not affect virulence. Substitution of four cysteine residues highly conserved in the Alphaherpesvirinae established that C95 is required for gE/gI heterodimer formation. The C95A and 105-125 (with residues 105 to 125 deleted) viruses had small-plaque phenotypes with reduced replication kinetics in vitro similar to those of the gI virus. The 105-125 virus was avirulent for human skin in vivo. In contrast, the C95A mutant replicated in vivo but with significantly reduced kinetics compared to those of the wild-type virus. In addition to abolished gE/gI heterodimer formation, gI from the C95A or the 105-125 mutant was not recognized by monoclonal antibodies that detect the canonical conformation of gI, demonstrating structural disruption of gI in these viruses. This alteration prevented gI incorporation into virus particles. Thus, residues C95 and 105 to 125 are critical for gI structure required for gE/gI heterodimer formation, virion incorporation, and ultimately, effective viral spread in human skin.

However, approximately 20% of children develop chronic ITP, which can be associated with significant morbidity because of long-term immunosuppression and splenectomy in refractory cases. To explore the molecular mechanism of chronic ITP compared with acute ITP, we studied 63 pediatric patients with ITP. Gene expression analysis of whole blood revealed distinct signatures for acute and chronic ITP. Oxidative stress-related pathways were among the pathways. Overexpression of VNN1, an oxidative stress sensor in epithelial cells, was most strongly associated with progression to chronic ITP. Studies of normal persons demonstrated VNN1 expression in a variety of blood cells. Exposure of blood mononuclear cells to oxidative stress inducers elicited dramatic up-regulation of VNN1 and down-regulation of PPAR, indicating a role for VNN1 as a peripheral blood oxidative stress sensor. Assessment of redox state by tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated statistically significant lower glutathione ratios in patients with ITP versus healthy controls; lower glutathione ratios were also seen in untreated patients with ITP compared with recently treated patients. Our work demonstrates distinct patterns of gene expression in acute and chronic ITP and implicates oxidative stress pathways in the pathogenesis of chronic pediatric ITP.

We examined DRG infection with recombinant VZV (recombinant Oka [rOka]) and the following gE mutants: gE27-90, gECys, gE-AYRV, and gE-SSTT. gE27-90, which lacks that interacts with a putative receptor insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), replicated as extensively as rOka, producing infectious virions and significant cytopathic effects within 14 days of inoculation. Since neural cells express IDE, the gE/IDE interaction was dispensable for VZV neurotropism. In contrast, gECys, which lacks gE/gI heterodimer formation, was significantly impaired at early times postinfection; viral genome copy numbers increased slowly, and infectious virus production was not detected until day 28. Delayed replication was associated with impaired cell-cell spread in ganglia, similar to the phenotype of a gI deletion mutant (rOkagI). However, at later time points, infection of satellite cells and other supportive nonneuronal cells resulted in extensive DRG tissue damage and cell loss such that cytopathic changes observed at day 70 were more severe than those for rOka-infected DRG. The replication of gE-AYRV, which is impaired for trans-Golgi network (TGN) localization, and the replication of gE-SSTT, which contains mutations in an acidic cluster, were equivalent to that of rOka, causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious virus production by day 14; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka. These experiments suggest that the gE interaction with cellular IDE, gE targeting to TGN sites of virion envelopment, and phosphorylation at SSTT are dispensable for VZV DRG infection, whereas the gE/gI interaction is critical for VZV neurovirulence.

We report a 3-year-old male who developed a coagulopathy and clinical bleeding after cardiothoracic surgery, during which bovine topical thrombin was used for local hemostasis. Laboratory tests revealed elevated prothrombin, partial thromboplastin, and thrombin times, and a low factor V activity level. He was found to have both human-thrombin and factor V inhibitors, among the first reported cases of these combined inhibitors secondary to bovine topical thrombin. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids with a rapid and durable response.

Guidelines were developed by consensus for expert recommendations (minimum level for approval, 70%) that included recommendations on the evaluation and interpretation of light transmission platelet aggregometry (LTA). To assess consensus, medical opinions on recommendations were gathered from diagnostic laboratories that perform LTA, in collaboration with the Quality Management Program-Laboratory Services (QMP-LS) in Ontario, Canada (10 laboratories), and the North American Specialized Coagulation Laboratory Association (NASCOLA; 47 laboratories, 5 overlapping the QMP-LS group). Adequate consensus was achieved for all and 89% of recommendations for the QMP-LS and NASCOLA groups, respectively. The recommendations adopted provide North American laboratories with additional guidance on platelet function testing, including how to interpret LTA abnormalities.

Diagnosing HIT remains a challenge, as the patients at risk often have other reasons for thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis. HIT is considered a clinicopathologic disorder whose diagnosis is generally made on the basis of both clinical criteria and the presence of \"HIT antibodies\" in the patient's serum or plasma. There are two basic laboratory approaches to detect HIT antibodies. The immunoassays detect antibodies based on their binding properties, whereas the functional assays detect antibodies based on their platelet-activating properties. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of HIT is imperative, as overdiagnosis exposes patients to alternative anticoagulants and their associated bleeding risks, whereas under- or delayed diagnosis leaves patients vulnerable to the thromboembolic sequelae of HIT, which can be life threatening. A critical interpretation of laboratory results by the clinician is an essential component of diagnosing HIT. This requires a keen understanding of the current concepts in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the disease, and the application of these concepts when interpreting the results of both the functional and immunoassays. Equally important is an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the current lack of standardization and proficiency testing, of these assays.

Here we report the first human disease-related mutations in the adaptor protein LNK, a negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling, in 2 patients with JAK2 V617F-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). One patient exhibited a 5 base-pair deletion and missense mutation leading to a premature stop codon and loss of the pleckstrin homology (PH) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. A second patient had a missense mutation (E208Q) in the PH domain. BaF3-MPL cells transduced with these LNK mutants displayed augmented and sustained thrombopoietin-dependent growth and signaling. Primary samples from MPN patients bearing LNK mutations exhibited aberrant JAK-STAT activation, and cytokine-responsive CD34(+) early progenitors were abnormally abundant in both patients. These findings indicate that JAK-STAT activation due to loss of LNK negative feedback regulation is a novel mechanism of MPN pathogenesis.

An extensive family history of gastric cancer raised suspicion for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Sequencing of the patient's CDH1 gene revealed a novel point mutation in a strictly conserved splice site within intron 6, c.833-2 A > G. This mutation was predicted to result in loss of function due to defective RNA splicing. To characterize the pathogenic mechanism of this mutation, we amplified the patient's CDH1 gene products by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Primers flanking the region of the mutation detected 3 distinct transcripts. In addition to the wild-type product, a larger product consistent with activation of a cryptic splice site within intron 6 and a smaller product shown to result from exon 7 skipping were detected. In summary, we have identified a novel CDH1 mutation in a large hereditary diffuse gastric cancer kindred and identified its pathogenic mechanism.

The application of high-throughput DNA sequencing to the study of rearranged Ig genes now makes this possible. The sequencing of thousands of VDJ rearrangements from an individual, either from genomic DNA or expressed mRNA, should allow their germline IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ repertoires to be inferred. In addition, where previously mere glimpses of diversity could be gained from sequencing studies, new large data sets should allow the rearrangement frequency of different genes and alleles to be seen with clarity. We analyzed the DNA of 108,210 human IgH chain rearrangements from 12 individuals and determined their individual IGH genotypes. The number of reportedly functional IGHV genes and allelic variants ranged from 45 to 60, principally because of variable levels of gene heterozygosity, and included 14 previously unreported IGHV polymorphisms. New polymorphisms of the IGHD3-16 and IGHJ6 genes were also seen. At heterozygous loci, remarkably different rearrangement frequencies were seen for the various IGHV alleles, and these frequencies were consistent between individuals. The specific alleles that make up an individual's Ig genotype may therefore be critical in shaping the combinatorial repertoire. The extent of genotypic variation between individuals is highlighted by an individual with aplastic anemia who appears to lack six contiguous IGHD genes on both chromosomes. These deletions significantly alter the potential expressed IGH repertoire, and possibly immune function, in this individual.

There is limited information regarding the performance characteristics and utility of TCRG and TCRB clonality assays in diagnosis of MF and ID from paraffin-embedded tissue sections. In this study, PCR tests were performed with both TCRG and TCRB BIOMED-2 clonality methods followed by capillary electrophoresis and Genescan analysis using DNA samples from 35 MF and 96 ID patients with 69 and 133 paraffin-embedded specimens, respectively. Performance characteristics were determined for each test individually and in combination. TCRG and TCRB tests demonstrated identical sensitivity (64%) and specificity (84%) when analyzed as individual assays. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and change of posttest MF probability over a range of MF pretest probabilities were obtained. These data were used to construct an algorithm for sequential use of TCRG and TCRB. As commercially BIOMED-2 PCR-based TCRG and TCRB clonality tests on paraffin-embedded tissue have no significant difference in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Combined use of the two tests in patients with intermediate pretest probabilities as proposed in the algorithm could improve test utility.

Even sequence-based assays may be limited depending on which gene regions are investigated. We sought to develop a clinically practical yet inclusive molecular assay to identify beta-globin mutations in multicultural populations. We highlight the beta-globin mutation detection assay (beta-GMDA), an extensive gene sequencing assay. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers are located to encompass virtually all hemoglobin beta locus (HBB) mutations. In addition, this assay is able to detect, by gap PCR, a common large deletion (Delta619 base pair), which would be missed by sequencing alone. We describe our 5-year experience with the beta-GMDA and indicate its capability for detecting homozygous, heterozygous, and compound heterozygous sequence changes, including previously unknown HBB variants. The beta-GMDA offers superior sensitivity and ease of use with comprehensive detection of HBB mutations that result in beta-globin chain variants.

Detection of this mutation aids diagnosis of these neoplasms, and quantification of JAK2 V617F may provide a method to monitor response to therapy. For these reasons, we designed a clinical assay that uses allele-specific PCR and real-time detection with of JAK2 wild-type JAK2, and GAPDH transcripts. Mutant and wild-type JAK2 were quantified by using external plasmid standards that contain the relevant JAK2 V617F or JAK2 sequence, respectively. We tested 55 peripheral blood specimens from patients with suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms and 55 peripheral blood specimens from patients not known to have myeloproliferative neoplasms. Low-level, nonspecific amplification was detected in reactions containing a high copy number of plasmid standards and in specimens from patients not known to have myeloproliferative neoplasms, necessitating the use of a laboratory-established mutant to wild-type cutoff. The limit of detection established by using cell line dilutions is 0.1%, and this method identified three JAK2 V617F-positive patients who were not detected by a less sensitive method. The assay characteristics and our initial evaluation indicate this method can be used for the detection and quantification of JAK2 V617F, which should be useful for diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms and potentially for monitoring minimal residual disease in future trials of therapies targeted to myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin can reduce the severity of VZV if given shortly after exposure. Glycoprotein H (gH) is a highly conserved herpesvirus protein with functions in virus entry and cell-cell spread and is a target of neutralizing antibodies. The anti-gH monoclonal antibody (MAb) 206 neutralizes VZV in vitro. To determine the requirement for gH in VZV pathogenesis in vivo, MAb 206 was administered to with human skin xenografts inoculated with VZV. Anti-gH antibody given at 6 h postinfection significantly reduced the frequency of skin xenograft infection by 42%. Virus titers, genome copies, and lesion size were decreased in xenografts that became infected. In contrast, administering anti-gH antibody at 4 days postinfection suppressed VZV replication but did not reduce the frequency of infection. The neutralizing anti-gH MAb 206 blocked virus entry, cell fusion, or both in skin in vivo. In vitro, MAb 206 bound to plasma membranes and to surface virus particles. Antibody was internalized into vacuoles within infected cells, associated with intracellular virus particles, and colocalized with markers for early endosomes and multivesicular bodies but not the trans-Golgi network. MAb 206 blocked spread, altered intracellular trafficking of gH, and bound to surface VZV particles, which might facilitate their uptake and targeting for degradation. As a consequence, antibody interference with gH function would likely prevent or significantly reduce VZV replication in skin during primary or recurrent infection.

In this work, we show that massively parallel DNA sequencing of rearranged immune receptor loci can provide direct detection and tracking of immune diversity and expanded clonal lymphocyte populations in physiological and pathological contexts. DNA was isolated from blood and tissue samples, a series of redundant primers was used to amplify diverse DNA rearrangements, and the resulting mixtures of barcoded amplicons were sequenced using long-read ultra deep sequencing. Individual DNA molecules were then characterized on the basis of DNA segments that had been joined to make a functional (or nonfunctional) immune effector. Current experimental designs can accommodate up to 150 samples in a single sequence run, with the depth of sequencing sufficient to identify stable and dynamic aspects of the immune repertoire in both normal and diseased circumstances. These data provide a high-resolution picture of immune spectra in normal individuals and in patients with hematological malignancies, illuminating, in the latter case, both the initial behavior of clonal tumor populations and the later suppression or re-emergence of such populations after treatment.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents an important paradigm for understanding the genetic and epigenetic events involved in CSC production. CML progresses from a chronic phase (CP) in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor the BCR-ABL translocation, to blast crisis (BC), characterized by aberrant activation of beta-catenin within granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). A major barrier to predicting and inhibiting blast crisis transformation has been the identification of mechanisms driving beta-catenin activation. Here we show that BC CML myeloid progenitors, in particular GMP, serially transplant leukemia in immunocompromised mice and thus are enriched for leukemia stem cells (LSC). Notably, cDNA sequencing of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway deletion of the GSK3beta kinase domain in the GMP of BC samples that was not detectable by sequencing in blasts or normal progenitors. Moreover, BC CML progenitors with misspliced GSK3beta have enhanced beta-catenin expression as well as serial engraftment potential while reintroduction of full-length GSK3beta reduces both in vitro replating and leukemic engraftment. We propose that CP CML is initiated by BCR-ABL expression in an HSC clone but that progression to BC may include missplicing of GSK3beta in GMP LSC, enabling in LSC self-renewal. Missplicing of GSK3beta represents a unique mechanism for the emergence of BC CML LSC and might provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.

In 2008, the revised WHO classification has expanded this category into \"AML with myelodysplasia-related changes\" (AML-MRC). We evaluated the clinical, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of 100 AML patients using the 2008 WHO criteria. Patients underwent genetic screening for NPM1, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835, and CEBPA mutations. Compared with patients with AML, not otherwise specified, patients with AML-MRC were significantly older (P= .014), presented with a lower hemoglobin (P= .044), more frequently expressed CD14 (P= .048), and exhibited a decreased frequency of CEBPA mutations (P= .001). Multivariate analysis indicated that patients with AML-MRC had a significantly worse overall survival, progression-free survival, and complete response compared with AML-not otherwise specified (all P< .001). These data support the clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic criteria for this 2008 WHO AML category.

Targeting of BCR-ABL with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has resulted in rapid clinical responses in the vast majority of patients with CML and Philadelphia chromosome+ ALL. However, long-term use of TKIs occasionally results in emergence of therapy resistance, in part through the selection of clones with mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. We present here an overview of the current practice in monitoring for such mutations, including the methods used, the clinical and laboratory criteria for triggering mutational analysis, and the guidelines for reporting BCR-ABL mutations. We also present a proposal for a public database for correlating mutational status with in vitro and in vivo responses to different TKIs to aid in the interpretation of mutation studies.

Accurate classification of uncertain primary cancers may improve with microarray-based gene expression testing. We evaluated the analytical performance characteristics of the Pathwork tissue of origin test, which uses expression signals from 1668 probe sets in a gene expression microarray, to quantify the similarity of tumor specimens to 15 known tissues of origin. Sixty archived tissue specimens from poorly and undifferentiated tumors (metastatic and primary) were analyzed at four laboratories representing a wide range of preanalytical conditions (eg, personnel, reagents, instrumentation, and protocols). Cross-laboratory comparisons showed highly reproducible results between laboratories, with correlation coefficients between 0.95 to 0.97 for measurements of similarity scores, and an average 93.8% overall concordance between laboratories in terms of final tissue calls. Bland-Altman plots (mean coefficients of reproducibility of 32.48+/-3.97) and kappa statistics (kappa >0.86) also indicated a high level of agreement between laboratories. We conclude that the Pathwork tissue of origin test is a robust assay that produces consistent results in diverse laboratory conditions reflecting the preanalytical variations found in the everyday clinical practice of molecular diagnostics laboratories.

Several genes correlated with ITP have been shown to be associated with expression signatures in systemic lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis, indicating an overlap with other autoimmune disorders. Pathway analysis demonstrated that IFN signalling, death receptor and protein ubiquitination pathways were associated with ITP. These results provide the first glimpse of the genes and pathways consistently aberrant in ITP, identifying new targets for investigations of pathogenesis and treatment of ITP.

The objective of this study was to examine potential adverse effects of concomitant aspirin and Ginkgo biloba on platelet function. Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761, 300 mg/day) was compared with placebo for effects on measures of platelet aggregation among adults consuming 325 mg/day aspirin in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of 4-week duration. Participants were adults, age 69 +/- 10 years, with PAD or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Outcome measures included platelet function analysis (PFA-100 analyzer) using ADP as an agonist (n = 26 = 29 ginkgo), and aggregation using ADP, collagen and ristocetin agonists (n = 21 placebo; n = 23 ginkgo). Participants kept daily logs of bleeding or bruising episodes. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences between treatment groups for any agonists, for either PFA-100 analysis or platelet aggregation. Reports of bleeding or bruising were infrequent and similar for both study groups. In conclusion, in older adults with PAD or cardiovascular disease risk, a relatively high dose of Ginkgo biloba combined with 325 mg/day daily aspirin did not have a clinically or statistically detectable impact on indices of coagulation examined over 4 weeks, compared with the effect of aspirin alone. No adverse bleeding events were observed, although the trial was limited to a small sample size.

As HIT is considered a clinico-pathologic entity, laboratory practices have an important role in diagnosing or excluding HIT. It was the objective of this study to assess the current status of laboratory testing for HIT in North America. An online survey consisting of 67 questions related to laboratory testing for HIT was developed by the North American Specialized Coagulation Laboratory Association (NASCOLA), and distributed to its 59 members. The survey included queries about HIT test ordering practices, HIT immunoassay and activation assays performed, and reporting practices. Data was collected from the 44 NASCOLA laboratories who responded. Of these sites, 88% performed immunoassays for HIT, commonly using commercial assays. However, sites varied in practices related to use of controls, immunoglobulin class of antibody detected, and in result interpretation and reporting. Platelet activation assays for HIT were performed by 36% of sites, commonly using assays of serotonin release (50%) or heparin-induced platelet aggregation (43%). Sites varied in the use of washed platelets versus platelet-rich plasma, controls, and heparin concentrations. This survey is the first comprehensive assessment of patterns of practice in HIT testing among diagnostic coagulation laboratories in North America. We observed site-specific variability of testing methods encompassing all stages of testing, including pre-analytical handling, testing methodologies, and result interpretation and reporting. The variability in HIT platelet activation assay methods among institutions indicates a need for proficiency testing to assess assay performance, and for consensus guidelines on HIT laboratory testing.

T-cell receptor (TCR)gamma chain rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (TCR-PCR) is a helpful adjuvant tool in this setting, but several of the inflammatory dermatoses in the differential diagnosis of MF may contain a clonal T-cell proliferation.We examined whether analysis for T-cell clonality and comparison of the clones with the standardized BIOMED-2 PCR multiplex primers for the TCRgamma chain from two anatomically distinct skin sites improves diagnostic accuracy.We examined two biopsy specimens each from 10 patients with unequivocal MF, from 18 patients with inflammatory dermatoses, and from 18 patients who could initially not be definitively given a diagnosis based on clinical and histopathologic criteria.Eight of 10 patients with unequivocal MF had an identical clone in both biopsy specimens. Two of 18 patients with inflammatory dermatoses were found to have a clone in one of the biopsy specimens. On further follow-up of the 18 patients with morphologically nondiagnostic biopsy specimens, 13 of 18 were later confirmed to have MF and 5 of 18 had inflammatory dermatoses. Eleven of 13 patients with MF had an identical clone in both biopsy specimens; two of 13 had a polyclonal amplification pattern in both biopsy specimens. Four of 5 patients with inflammatory dermatoses had no clone in either biopsy specimen. One patient with an inflammatory dermatosis had an identical clone in both specimens. The sensitivity of TCR-PCR analysis to evaluate for an identical clone at different anatomic skin sites (dual TCR-PCR) is 82.6% and the specificity is 95.7%.The number of patients in the study group was limited.These data suggest that dual TCR-PCR is a very promising technique with high specificity in distinguishing MF from inflammatory dermatoses.

Identification of individuals at high risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer affords the opportunity for endoscopic screening or elective prophylactic gastrectomy. We set out to develop a CDH1 sequencing assay for clinical use.All exons of the CDH1 gene were amplified and sequenced with published and modified primers.While validating the assay, we encountered a case in which a single nucleotide polymorphism located in intron 15 led to allele dropout and therefore to a false-negative result. The polymorphism leading to allele dropout was located within a primer-binding sequence, five bases away from the 3' end of the primer. A frameshift mutation in exon 15 was detected by an alternative primer that binds away from the polymorphic site. A search of the University of California Santa Cruz single nucleotide polymorphism database revealed other polymorphisms located within primer-binding sites. A total of 12 primers in nine primer sets were modified to minimize allele dropout risk.The approach of designing primers to avoid known single nucleotide polymorphisms can be generalized to the design of any polymerase chain reaction-based assay and should be employed whenever possible.

Our investigation of the role of glycoprotein I (gI), which is dispensable in vitro, examines the functions of a VZV gene product during infection of human neural cells in vivo. Whereas intact recombinant Oka (rOka) initiated a short replicative phase followed by persistence in DRGs, the gI deletion mutant, rOkaDeltagI, showed prolonged replication with no transition to persistence up to 70 days after infection. Only a few varicella-zoster nucleocapsids and cytoplasmic virions were observed in neurons, and the major VZV glycoprotein, gE, was retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of gI. VZV neurotropism was not disrupted when DRG xenografts were infected with rOka mutants lacking gI promoter elements that bind cellular transactivators, specificity factor 1 (Sp1) and upstream stimulatory factor (USF). Because gI is essential and Sp1 and USF contribute to VZV pathogenesis in skin and T cells in vivo, these DRG experiments indicate that the genetic requirements for VZV infection are less stringent in neural cells in vivo. The observations demonstrate that gI is important for VZV neurotropism and suggest that a strategy to reduce neurovirulence by deleting gI could prolong active infection in human DRGs.

The aim of this study was to identify current diagnostic practices in the absence of comprehensive practice guidelines. Thirty-five clinical molecular laboratories that conduct prenatal testing agreed to participate in a clinical practice survey. The survey included questions about sample requirements, test indications, assay type, test performance and limitations, criteria and management of uninformative test results, reporting, and billing. Sixty percent of participating laboratories performed testing on direct and cultured amniotic fluid, whereas forty percent tested cultured cells only. Most also accepted chorionic villus samples. Although MCC testing of fetal samples is recommended in guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics, only 60% of surveyed laboratories performed it without exception. Commercially available assays were used by 75% of participating laboratories, and at least five identity markers were evaluated at 87% of the laboratories. The reported lower limit of MCC detection ranged from 1 to 20% but was not determined in all laboratories. MCC testing was performed in the majority of molecular diagnostic laboratories, but guidelines for standardization are needed to ensure optimal and accurate prenatal patient care.

However, the wide variety of MRD techniques makes it difficult to interpret and compare different clinical trials. Our aim was to develop a standardized flow cytometric CLL-MRD assay and compare it to real-time quantitative allele-specific oligonucleotide (RQ-ASO) Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of 728 paired blood and marrow samples demonstrated high concordance (87%) for patients off-therapy. Blood analysis was equally or more sensitive than marrow in 92% of samples but marrow analysis was necessary to detect MRD within 3 months of alemtuzumab therapy. Assessment of 50 CLL-specific antibody combinations identified three (CD5/CD19 with CD20/CD38, CD81/CD22 and CD79b/CD43) with low inter-laboratory variation and false-detection rates. Experienced operators demonstrated an accuracy of 95.7% (specificity 98.8%, sensitivity 91.1%) in 141 samples with 0.01-0.1% CLL. There was close correlation and 95% concordance with RQ-ASO IgH-PCR for detection of CLL above 0.01%. The proposed flow cytometry approach is applicable to all sample types and therapeutic regimes, and sufficiently rapid and sensitive to guide therapy to an MRD-negativity in real time. These techniques may be used as a tool for assessing response and comparing the efficacy of different therapeutic approaches.

Eligibility included those without dementia or depression, not taking psychoactive medications or medications or supplements that alter hemostasis.Ninety subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or a ginkgo biloba-based supplement containing 160 mg ginkgo biloba, 68 mg gotu kola, and 180 mg decosahexaenoic acid per day for 4 months.Assessments included: six standardized cognitive function tests, the SF-36 Quality of Life questionnaire, the Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (Dade Behring, Eschbom, Germany), and the monitoring of adverse events.Baseline characteristics and study hypotheses were tested using analysis of covariance. Tests were two-tailed with a 0.05 significance level.Seventy-eight subjects (87%) completed both baseline and 4-month testing (n=36 in placebo group, n=42 in ginkgo biloba group). At baseline, the participants' cognitive function was above average. One of six cognitive tests indicated significant protocol differences at 4 months (P=0.03), favoring the placebo. There were no significant differences in quality of life, platelet function, or adverse events.These finding do not support the use of a ginkgo biloba-containing supplement for improving cognitive function or quality of life in cognitively intact, older, healthy adults. However, high baseline scores may have contributed to the null findings. The ginkgo biloba product seems safe and did not alter platelet function, though additional studies are needed to evaluate the interaction of varying doses of ginkgo biloba and ginkgo biloba-containing supplements with medications and supplements that alter hemostasis.

Using DNA microarrays that contained 24,473 unique putative genes, we found 176 cDNAs that were strongly correlated with ITP. These included a cluster of interferon-regulated genes and TLR7, as well many less-well characterized genes which are candidates for further study. We believe this approach is likely to yield new insights into our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of ITP.

The achievement of a molecular remission did not correlate with improved outcome. The major toxicity was expected myelosuppression. Two patients died during induction treatment. There were no major adverse effects during maintenance therapy.In a multicenter trial, modified R-hyperCVAD was tolerable and effective induction therapy for untreated MCL.

We developed a mouse model of chronic asthma that results in markedly increased numbers of airway mast cells, enhanced airway responses to methacholine or antigen, chronic inflammation including infiltration with eosinophils and lymphocytes, airway epithelial goblet cell hyperplasia, enhanced expression of the mucin genes Muc5ac and Muc5b, and increased levels of lung collagen. Using mast cell-deficient (Kit(W-sh/W-sh) and/or Kit(W/W-v)) mice engrafted with FcRgamma+/+ or FcRgamma-/- mast cells, we found that mast cells were required for the full development of each of these features of the model. However, some features also were expressed, although usually at less than wild-type levels, in mice whose mast cells lacked FcRgamma and therefore could not be activated by either antigen- and IgE-dependent aggregation of Fc epsilonRI or the binding of antigen-IgG1 immune complexes to Fc gammaRIII. These findings demonstrate that mast cells can contribute to the development of multiple features of chronic asthma in mice and identify both Fc Rgamma-dependent and Fc Rgamma-independent pathways of mast cell activation as important for the expression of key features of this asthma model.

Its role in fetal and maternal physiology is remarkably diverse. Because of the central role that the placenta has in fetal and maternal physiology and development, the possibility that variation in placental gene expression patterns might be linked to important abnormalities in maternal or fetal health, or even variations in later life, warrants investigation. As an initial step, we used DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression patterns in 72 samples of amnion, chorion, umbilical cord, and sections of villus parenchyma from 19 human placentas from successful full-term pregnancies. The umbilical cord, chorion, amnion, and villus parenchyma samples were readily distinguished by differences in their global gene-expression patterns, many of which seemed to be related to physiology and histology. Differentially expressed genes have roles that include placental trophoblast secretion, signal transduction, metabolism, immune regulation, cell adhesion, and structure. We found interindividual differences in expression patterns in villus parenchyma and systematic differences between the maternal, fetal, and intermediate layers. A group of genes that was expressed in both the maternal and fetal villus parenchyma sections of placenta included genes that may be associated with preeclampsia. We identified sets of genes whose expression in placenta was significantly correlated with the sex of the fetus. This study provides a rich and diverse picture of the molecular variation in the placenta from healthy pregnancies.

We carried out a phase 1/2 dose-escalation clinical study to extend this approach to humans with severe hemophilia B. rAAV-2 vector expressing human F.IX was infused through the hepatic artery into seven subjects. The data show that: (i) vector infusion at doses up to 2 x 10(12) vg/kg was not associated with acute or long-lasting toxicity; (ii) therapeutic levels of F.IX were achieved at the highest dose tested; (iii) duration of expression at therapeutic levels was limited to a period of approximately 8 weeks; (iv) a gradual decline in F.IX was accompanied by a transient asymptomatic elevation of liver transaminases that resolved without treatment. Further studies suggested that destruction of transduced hepatocytes by cell-mediated immunity targeting antigens of the AAV capsid caused both the decline in F.IX and the transient transaminitis. We conclude that rAAV-2 vectors can transduce human hepatocytes in vivo to result in therapeutically relevant levels of F.IX, but that future studies in humans may require immunomodulation to achieve long-term expression.

DNA levels in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and to confirm its prognostic significance.Plasma from 58 newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were collected before, during, and every 3 to 6 months after radiotherapy. EBV DNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR using primer/probe sets for polymerase-1 (Pol-1), latent membrane protein 2 (Lmp2), and BamHI-W. Pretreatment levels from the three assays were correlated with each other and serial measurements from the Pol-1 assay were correlated with clinical variables.Pol-1 was more accurate than BamHI-W in predicting EBV DNA concentrations in cell lines. Of the three assays, BamHI-W yielded the highest concentrations followed by Pol-1 in plasmas (n = 23). The correlation coefficient was 0.99 (P < 0.0001) for Pol-1 and Lmp2, (P < < 0.0001) for BamHI-W and Lmp2. Elevated pretreatment DNA levels as detected by Pol-1 were correlated with advanced nodal stage (P = 0.04) and overall stage (P = 0.028). There was no correlation between pretreatment EBV DNA levels and freedom-from-relapse or overall survival; however, there was a significant correlation between posttreatment levels and these variables. The 2-year freedom-from-relapse and overall survival rates were 92% and 94% for patients with undetectable, and 37% and 55% for those with detectable, posttreatment levels (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.002).The three PCR assays yielded similar results in detecting EBV DNA in plasmas. The Pol-1-detected posttreatment EBV DNA level was the strongest predictor for treatment outcomes.

We report a case where bone-marrow biopsies from patients of different genders were mislabeled and molecular methods were applied to resolve the identity. A short tandem repeat (STR)-polymerase chain reaction-based assay, commonly used in paternity testing, was employed in an attempt to assign the correct identity to the specimens. However, the specimens had been processed by decalcification and the DNA yield was poor. One of the markers in the assay is the non-STR amelogenin locus that distinguishes the X and Y chromosomes. This amelogenin marker results in a product of low molecular weight, enabling unequivocal resolution of identity despite a poor DNA yield. The prevalence of errors in pathology due to specimen misidentifications is reviewed.

We developed a model using human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice to investigate VZV infection of differentiated neurons and satellite cells in vivo. DRG engrafted under the kidney capsule and contained neurons and satellite cells within a typical DRG architecture. VZV clinical isolates infected the neurons within DRG. At 14 days postinfection, VZ virions were detected by electron microscopy in neuronal cell nuclei and cytoplasm but not in satellite cells. The VZV genome copy number was 7.1 x 10(7) to 8.0 x 10(8) copies per 10(5) cells, and infectious virus was recovered. This initial phase of viral replication was followed within 4-8 weeks by a transition to VZV latency, characterized by the absence of infectious virus release, the cessation of virion assembly, and a reduction in VZV genome copies to 3.7 x 10(5) to 4.7 x 10(6) per 10(5) cells. VZV persistence in DRG was achieved without any requirement for VZV-specific adaptive immunity and was associated with continued transcription of the ORF63 regulatory gene. The live attenuated varicella vaccine virus exhibited the same pattern of short-term replication, persistence of viral DNA, and prominent ORF63 transcription as the clinical isolates. VZV-infected T cells transferred virus from the circulation into DRG, suggesting that VZV lymphotropism facilitates its neurotropism. DRG xenografts may be useful for investigating neuropathogenic mechanisms of other human viruses.

In normal mouse hematopoietic stem cells, the process of self-renewal involves the beta-catenin-signaling pathway. We investigated whether leukemic stem cells in CML also use the beta-catenin pathway for self-renewal.We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate hematopoietic stem cells, common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors from marrow during several phases of CML and from normal marrow. BCR-ABL, beta-catenin, and LEF-1 transcripts were compared by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay in normal and CML hematopoietic stem lymphoid enhancer reporter assay were used to detect nuclear beta-catenin in these cells. In vitro replating assays were used to identify self-renewing cells as candidate leukemic stem cells, and the dependence of self-renewal on beta-catenin activation was tested by lentiviral transduction of pathway.The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor pool patients with CML in blast crisis and imatinib-resistant CML was expanded, expressed BCR-ABL, and had elevated levels of nuclear beta-catenin as compared with the levels in progenitors from normal marrow. Unlike normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors formed self-renewing, replatable myeloid colonies, and in vitro self-renewal capacity was reduced by enforced expression of axin.Activation of beta-catenin in CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors appears to enhance the self-renewal activity and leukemic potential of these cells.

Whereas the diagnosis of ACH can be established on clinical and radiologic grounds alone in the majority of cases, HYCH is more difficult to confirm. Molecular genetic analysis of both skeletal dysplasias can be especially helpful for the purpose of prenatal diagnosis, in early childhood to differentiate definitively between the largely overlapping phenotypes, and in atypical presentations. The two most prevalent mutations for each syndrome cause substitution of a single respective nucleotide. These mutations can be identified by a variety of molecular methods, including PCR with restriction enzyme digestion or direct DNA sequencing. We have developed a single-step, real-time PCR assay in which two detection probes are applied in combination with a single anchor probe at each mutation position. Because the two most prevalent mutations for each syndrome cause substitution of a single respective nucleotide, this approach guarantees optimal differentiation during probe dissociation analysis after amplification. This assay, which is performed on the LightCycler thermocycler, enables the rapid and reliable detection of the two most common FGFR3 mutations associated with ACH (1138G N540K) in a single test.

The diagnosis of MCL can be problematic, and existing CCND1 expression assays show a lack of specificity, with elevated expression also detected in other lymphoproliferative disorders. We postulated that evaluating CCND1 expression relative to CCND3 expression by quantitative PCR could offer an improved specificity over an evaluation of CCND1 alone. This method quantitates both CCND1 and CCND3, each normalized to a housekeeping gene (GADPH), using the 5'-exonuclease technique. We analyzed 107 clinical specimens: (17), chronic leukemias (CLL) (10), other non-MCL hematolymphoid disorders (41), non-malignant tissues with an epithelial component (7) and other normal samples (32). This method correctly identified 16 of 17 MCLs, and there were no false positives among any of the other diagnostic groups tested including CLL. CLL presents the major diagnostic dilemma at this institution when diagnosing MCL. Sensitivity studies showed that this method could detect an elevated CCND1/CCND3 ratio when the tumor infiltrate is at least 10% of the cells. We compared the specificity of CCND1 expression alone against the CCND1/CCND3 ratio to demonstrate the increased specificity for the latter. We conclude that the CCND1/CCND3 ratio is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of MCL.

The relationship between tHcy and mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unsettled. This randomized trial evaluates the efficacy of high-dose folic acid in preventing events in ESRD. A total of 510 patients on chronic dialysis were randomized to 1, 5, or 15 mg of folic acid contained in a renal multivitamin with a median follow-up of 24 mo. Mortality, cardiovascular events, and homocysteine levels were assessed. There were 189 deaths, and 121 patients experienced at least one cardiovascular event. Composite rates of mortality and cardiovascular events among the folic acid groups did not differ (at 24 mo: 43.7% in 1 mg group, 38.6% in 5 mg group, 47.1% in 15 mg group; log-rank P = 0.47). Unexpectedly, high baseline tHcy was associated with lower event rates. From lowest to highest quartile, event rates at 24 mo were 54.5% for Q1, (log-rank P = 0.033). In contrast to some studies describing tHcy as a risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular events, this study found a reverse relationship between tHcy and events in ESRD patients. Administration of high-dose folic acid did not affect event rates.

The frequency with which hematologists are called in consultation for thrombocytopenia continues to increase with the advent of routine automated platelet determinations and the introduction of new medications. For most patients, such as those with inherited and auto-immune thrombocytopenia, emphasis is focused on efforts to treat or forestall bleeding without excess drug-induced toxicity or burden to the patient. However, in disorders such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), avoidance of thrombotic complications is the key to management. In this chapter, we provide the pediatric and adult hematologist with new insights into the pathogenesis and recognition of congenital inherited thrombocytopenias (CTP), a hitherto difficult to comprehend constellation of clinical entities. We also highlight new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of two of the more common thrombocytopenic conditions encountered in practice, autoimmune or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and HIT. In Section I, Dr. James Bussel discusses CTPs and their distinction from childhood ITP. He emphasizes the clinical features that enable the pediatrician and hematologist to suspect the diagnosis of CTP and those that are of use to subcategorize the various entities, where possible. He also emphasizes newer molecular markers that afford definitive diagnosis in some cases and provide insight into platelet production. This section highlights the characteristic associated findings and differences in the natural history and approaches to management of the various entities. In Section II, Dr. Robert McMillan discusses adult chronic ITP. He revisits the utility of platelet antibody determination in diagnosis and review new insights into pathogenesis. The role of Helicobacter pylori infection and the timing of splenectomy in the management of acute and emergent ITP are examined. New insights into the natural history of ITP post-splenectomy and management strategies for patients with severe, chronic, refractory ITP are discussed. In Section III, Dr. James Zehnder updates us on HIT. He emphasizes new insights into the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of this condition. He critically reviews the utility of laboratory testing for heparin-dependent antibodies. Recent studies on the use of direct thrombin inhibitors are examined and the management of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in patients with HIT is discussed.

Two recently identified prothrombin gene mutations (20209C>T and 20221C>T) have been observed in non-Caucasian patients with thrombosis. The mutations are located near the commonly identified variant 20210G>A and have not been reported in Caucasian patients. The authors report a novel connection with pregnancy complications. The identification of sequence variants other than 20210G>A in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene suggests that additional nucleotide substitutions may contribute to the development of thrombotic events and adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially in less well-characterized populations.

These single nucleotide polymorphisms can be diagnosed with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, fluorescent genotyping on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and microarray-based testing on the novel NanoChip electronic microarray (NanoChip Molecular Biology Workstation, Nanogen, San Diego, CA). We compared these methods for accuracy, time to results, throughput, and interpretation. Results from 789 of 800 individual amplicons analyzed on the NanoChip were in complete agreement with the other assays. Eleven were \"no calls\" (uninterpreted by the NanoChip system) resulting from failed polymerase chain reaction amplifications. Although the NanoChip System, when used in a low-throughput setting, requires more overall time than the LightCycler, it is nearly equivalent per genotyping call. Owing to minimal sample handling, assay results are more reliable on the NanoChip platform and on the LightCycler than with RFLP. The NanoChip assay is reliable and may be especially valuable to laboratories with a large volume of thrombophilia test requests.

Although a viral etiology has been postulated, a definitive viral agent has not been identified. Recent reports have suggested that human herpesvirus 8 (HHV 8) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may play an etiologic role. We investigated the presence of HHV 8 and EBV in archival tissue from 34 cases of Kikuchi's histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. We examined 29 cases for HHV 8 using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on paraffin-embedded or frozen tissue, and 24 cases for EBV RNA using in situ hybridization (ISH) for EBER1. Controls included reactive lymph nodes from 8 adult women presenting with cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The study patients included 7 men and 27 women with a mean age of 28 years. All patients were previously healthy without evidence of immunocompromise and presented with cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Two cases exhibited EBV RNA by ISH; this was confirmed by PCR for EBV DNA. HHV 8 DNA was not amplified by nested PCR in any of the cases of Kikuchi's histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis or reactive lymph nodes; control PCR demonstrated the presence of amplifiable DNA in all cases.

Molecular analysis of the factor V gene revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the last nucleotide of exon 10. 1701G>T causes activation of a cryptic exonic splice site in exon 10, which encodes part of the factor V heavy chain (A2 domain). This leads to the deletion of 35 nucleotides and results in a frameshift with a premature stop codon at amino acid position 498. The G1701 and corresponding Gln509 are conserved in murine, bovine, and porcine factor V and in human factor VIII. Few factor V deficiency mutations have been identified as yet. Several are present in the heterozygous form in combination with factor V Leiden (Arg506Gln). This is the first reported homozygous splice site mutation in a patient with factor V deficiency.

We report a homozygous nucleotide change (G6395A) in two Tunisian probands with Factor V deficiency and bleeding episodes. This substitution results in the replacement of an arginine (R) by a histidine (H) in amino acid position 2074, located in the Factor V C2-domain. Mutations in this protein domain have not previously been described. Several lines of evidence support that this sequence variant is indeed disease causing: 1) Crystal structures of Factor V and molecular C2-domain modeling studies of H2074 suggest that the conserved R2074 is required for correct folding; 2) Structure-function studies of selective Factor V mutants (R2074A) demonstrate the importance of R2074 for structural stability of the Factor V C2-domain and for cofactor activity (1); 3) In Factor VIII, point mutations in codon 2209, which corresponds to position 2074 in Factor V, cause hemophilia A.

The genetic-environmental interactions involved in the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease are unknown. In our previous study a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (397C) in the regulatory untranslated first intron region of the BCL-6 gene was found in four of the eight FCL patients but in none of the 10 healthy controls. To further evaluate the potential association between the 397C allele of the BCL-6 gene and FCL, we performed a case-control study. Genomic DNA was isolated from 85 FCL patients, from 98 control cases without a previous history of malignancy, treated at Stanford University Medical Center for non-malignant disorders and from 90 samples from the DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource. The 397G and the 397C polymorphic alleles were identified by a PCR-RFLP method. To evaluate the possible effect of this polymorphism on gene expression, BCL-6 mRNA levels in nine FCL tumors with the 397G-G genotype and in nine FCL tumors with the 397G-C measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The allele was found in 32 FCL cases (37.6%), in 20 controls (20.4%) and in 17 (18.9%) samples from the DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource. The prevalence of the 397G-C and 397C-C genotypes was significantly higher in FCL cases than in control group (p = 0.01). No difference in BCL-6 gene expression was observed between FCL cases with 397G-G and 397G-C genotypes. The present study demonstrates a possible association between the 397C allele of the BCL-6 proto-oncogene and FCL. The similar BCL-6 mRNA expression in 397G-G and in 397G-C FCL cases suggests that any possible oncogenic effect of the polymorphic allele would not simply be related to a direct effect on BCL-6 gene expression and suggests the existence of other FCL susceptibility genes that are in linkage disequilibrium with the 397C allele of the BCL-6 gene.

As CVD mortality is high, we examined the relationship between homozygosity and duration of dialysis.Mean tHcy was higher in patients without a history of CVD (35.2 micromol/L vs. 30.4 micromol/L, P = 0.02). In multivariate models, CVD was negatively associated with tHcy and positively associated with TT genotype, male gender, and body mass index. Mean tHcy levels were higher among those with the TT genotype compared with those with the CC genotype when adjusted for age, folate, creatinine, micromol/L vs. 31.9 micromol/L, P = 0.005). Among whites, the prevalence of the TT genotype was higher in those having undergone less than one year of dialysis (P = 0.002).The C677T genotype of MTHFR is associated with CVD in ESRD and may be a more meaningful marker than tHcy for abnormal homocysteine metabolism in ESRD. Prospective data from ongoing clinical trials are needed to improve our understanding of these findings. Screening for this polymorphism may help guide prevention measures.

Establishment of parameters that can predict outcome could help to identify patients who may benefit from risk-adjusted therapies. BCL-6 is a proto-oncogene commonly implicated in DLBCL pathogenesis. A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay was established for accurate and reproducible determination of BCL-6 mRNA expression. The method was applied to evaluate the prognostic significance of BCL-6 expression in DLBCL. BCL-6 mRNA expression was assessed in tumor specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis from 22 patients with primary DLBCL. All patients were subsequently treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. These patients could be divided into 2 DLBCL subgroups, one with high BCL-6 gene expression whose median overall survival (OS) time was 171 months and the other with low BCL-6 gene expression whose median OS was 24 months (P =.007). BCL-6 gene expression also predicted OS in an independent validation set of 39 patients with primary DLBCL (P =.01). BCL-6 protein expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry, also predicted longer OS in patients with DLBCL. BCL-6 gene expression was an independent survival predicting factor in multivariate analysis together with the elements of the International Prognostic Index (IPI) (P =.038). By contrast, the aggregate IPI score did not add further prognostic information to the patients' stratification by BCL-6 gene expression. High BCL-6 mRNA expression should be considered a new favorable prognostic factor in DLBCL and should be used in the stratification and the design of risk-adjusted therapies for patients with DLBCL.

CD31 is a candidate human mHag relevant to acute GVHD, but reports disagree about its level of significance, the role of HLA restriction, and the relative importance of different polymorphic codons within the molecule. We therefore examined in greater detail the impact of CD31-matching on BMT outcome in a prospective study from a single institution. Samples of recipient and donor DNA were collected pretransplantation for all patients receiving unmanipulated bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling over a 45-month period at our institution. CD31 DNA typing of alleles at the 3 polymorphic codons 125 (L or V), 563 (N or S), and 670 (R or G) was performed for 118 patient-donor pairs plus 2 additional pairs who had codon 125 typing only. Donor-recipient CD31 nonidentity was tested for correlation with BMT clinical outcome measures of severe acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, and survival. Gene frequencies of approximately 0.5 for each allele at all 3 codons were comparable to previous reports. Because complete association was seen for 563N with 670G and for 563S with 670R, nonidentity for those codons was analyzed as single genetic marker designated codon 563/670. Donor-recipient CD31 nonidentity was a significant risk factor for overall survival, both at codon 563/670 (hazard ratio [hr] = 2.58, P = .005) and at codon 125 (hr = 1.07, P = .036). Similar results held for disease-free survival. Nonidentity at codon 563/670 was also a significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR] = 11.15, P = .011) for severe (grades III, IV) versus no (grade 0) acute GVHD. Nonidentity at codon 125 posed less but still significant risk (OR = 9.30, P = .030). When the comparison group without severe acute GVHD was expanded to include grade I as well as grade 0 patients, the risk from CD31 nonidentity increased for both codon 563/670 (OR = 12.31, P = .010) and codon 125 (OR = 11.24, P = .011). CD31 nonidentity remained a significant independent risk factor for survival and for severe acute GVHD when tested in multivariate analysis with the covariates of adulthood, recipient-donor sex difference, ethnic group, disease, pretransplantation risk category, HLA-A2 type, B44-like types, and GVHD prophylactic regimen. CD31 nonidentity showed a trend but failed to achieve statistical significance as a risk factor for relapse and for chronic GVHD. In conclusion, donor-recipient CD31 nonidentity is a significant risk factor for survival and for severe acute GVHD in HLA-identical sibling BMT. The stronger associations with codon 563/670 suggest that polymorphism may be more important than the linked polymorphism at codon 125.

Combining polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with heteroduplex annealing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has been used to detect clonal T-cell receptor rearrangements, particularly in skin biopsy specimens. The authors have developed a similar PCR heteroduplex assay for detection of clonal VDJ immunoglobulin gene using two sets of primers based on relatively conserved consensus regions in the J(H) and framework I and 2 regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain V region gene. This method is able to detect a clonal rearrangement when the clone comprises as little as 1% of the population in a polyclonal B-cell background. It may be used on fresh, frozen, or paraffin-embedded tissue and detects a clonal population in a majority of lymphoma subtypes. Compared with conventional PCR analysis, this method requires only a short additional cycle of denaturation and slow renaturation before PAGE. Interpretation is simplified as the clonal PCR product migrates away from the polyclonal background products.

In all but 2 cases, the CD20+ large cells showed a mix of kappa and lambda light chain expression. Two cases showed a focal predominance of kappa expression. In situ hybridization using the EBER1 probe for detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) RNA was performed on every case. EBV RNA was present in 10 cases. Of 8 cases with EBV RNA stained by immunohistochemistry for the latent membrane protein of EBV, 6 were positive. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization confirmed that EBV was present in the large B cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma chain gene in 12 of 13 cases tested. One additional case showed a clonal rearrangement of the TCR-beta chain gene by Southern blot hybridization. PCR analysis showed a clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in 5 cases, a suggestion of a clonal rearrangement in 1, an oligoclonal pattern in 4, and a polyclonal pattern in 4. The finding of large B and T cells may result in a misdiagnosis of a reactive process or of T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma. The presence of EBV in some cases could cause further confusion with the reactive T- and B-immunoblastic proliferation of infectious mononucleosis.

Available techniques often require either fresh tissue, several primer pairs, nested amplifications, or specialized electrophoresis steps such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Our method is based on heteroduplex analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the TCRgamma in a nondenaturing modified polyacrylamide gel using a single pair of primers and is adapted for paraffin-embedded tissue. When tested against Southern blot analysis, the PCR results correlated in 8 of 9 cases. Six mature cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and 29 inflammatory skin disorders all resulted in a polyclonal amplification pattern. When analyzing 3-mm or 4-mm punch biopsies of 51 cases of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 37 (72.5%) showed a clonal rearrangement with this technique. For 7 cases of patch stage mycosis fungoides, frozen tissue and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue was available, and in 5 of 7 cases (71%), the results in frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue were concordant. One case showed a clonal pattern in frozen tissue but not in paraffin-embedded tissue, and one case was polyclonal in frozen tissue but monoclonal in paraffin-embedded tissue. Using serial dilutions of DNA from a T-cell ALL in a polyclonal background (tonsil), we established a sensitivity of 0.5%. Heteroduplex PCR of the TCRgamma is a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive screening procedure as well as a useful adjunct to histologic analysis and immunophenotyping of cutaneous T-cell proliferations.

Clinical transformation is variably accompanied by a spectrum of histologic changes characterized by alteration in growth and cytology. Although several cytogenetic events and potential oncogenes have been documented in this progression, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. We present five patients with an unusual histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma manifested by blastic/blastoid morphology. This transformation is histologically distinct from other types of transformation of follicular lymphoma. All five cases exhibited the t(14;18) translocation and expressed the BCL-2 protein. In addition, two of the five patients showed increased levels of the p53 protein within neoplastic cells implicating a possible role for this oncogene in blastic/blastoid transformation. The lack of BCL-1 and myeloid antigens by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry studies served to distinguish blastic/blastoid transformation of follicular lymphoma from its morphologic mimics. This distinction is clinically important because lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias require significantly different therapeutic modalities and show better prognosis. Moreover, the lack of Epstein-Barr virus-specific mRNA suggests that this virus is unlikely to participate in blastic/blastoid transformation of follicular lymphoma.

Adhesion is mediated, at least in part, through binding interactions involving its first N-terminal Ig-like domain, but it is still unclear which sequences in this domain are required for in vivo function. Therefore, to identify functionally important regions of the first Ig-like domain of PECAM-1 that are required for the participation of PECAM-1 in in vivo neutrophil recruitment, a panel of mAbs against this region of PECAM-1 was generated and characterized in in vitro adhesion assays and in an in vivo model of cutaneous inflammation. It was observed that mAbs that disrupted PECAM-1-dependent homophilic adhesion in an L assay TNF-alpha-induced intradermal accumulation of neutrophils in a transmigration model using human skin transplanted onto SCID mice. Localization of the epitopes of these Abs indicated that these function-blocking Abs mapped to specific regions on either face of domain 1. This suggests that these regions of the first Ig-like domain may contain or be close to binding sites involved in PECAM-1-dependent homophilic adhesion, and thus may represent potential targets for the development of antiinflammatory reagents.

We have developed real-time TaqMan PCR assays directed toward two of these tumor-associated DNA markers, the t(14;18)(q32;q21.3) at the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 gene and the t(11;14)(q13;q32) at the bcl-1 major translocation cluster. During analysis of serial dilutions of t(14;18)-positive DNA, the t(14;18) real-time PCR was at least as sensitive as nested PCR and demonstrated enhanced quantitative potential. Moreover, in a blinded comparison of the t(14;18) real-time PCR and a clinically validated nested PCR protocol using 134 cell line and patient DNA samples, the real-time PCR detected the translocation in 30.0% more cases Both the and t(11;14) real-time PCR assays were used to quantitate minimal residual disease (MRD) in an NHL clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of a tumor-purging protocol in autologous stem cell transplantation. The assays were also used to evaluate disease depletion in an ex vivo tumor spiking model in which normal peripheral blood was spiked with tumor cell lines and processed according to the clinical purging method. PCR data from both the clinical trial and the ex vivo model demonstrated a 4 to 6 log reduction in tumor cells during CD34+ and CD34+ Thy-1+ enrichment. Because the t(14;18) and t(11;14) real-time PCR assays are very sensitive, quantitative, rapid, and require no post-PCR manipulation, they may serve as practical alternatives to nested PCR.

To test the reliability of PCR a collaborative study was undertaken to compare results from different laboratories in Europe and North America.Twenty laboratories with records of publication in molecular diagnostics were sent blood from normal donors with varying numbers of t(14;18)-bearing cells added from a cell line with a translocation in the major breakpoint region (MBR) of the bcl-2 gene. Samples contained 1000, 100, 10, 1 or 0 cells per ml of whole blood and were sent blinded in duplicate. PCR methodology varied widely, with the total number of amplification cycles between 30 and 70, and 13 different primers used for the MBR region. Twelve laboratories used nested PCR and eight single round amplification.The sensitivity of nested and single round PCR was similar at 100 cells/ml but below this the nested method proved significantly more sensitive. The false positive rate was 28%, with 11 samples from 9 laboratories reported as positive when no t(14;18) cells were added. PCR product size and sequence analysis showed that false positives were due to contamination from cell-line DNA rather than background translocations in the donors. There was no significant difference in false positive rates between nested and single round techniques.The polymerase chain reaction to detect bcl-2-IgH rearrangements is presently carried out with widely disparate results. Further effort is required to bring forward a standard PCR protocol which can be re-tested in different laboratories to improve accuracy and reproducibility. The application of quantitative techniques such as real-time PCR may resolve many of the problems presently encountered.

Within exon 13 of factor V, a 4 base insertion was found at NT 2856 in the proband and son. but not the daughter. This mutation, here designated factor V Stanford, results in a frameshift with loss of a thrombin activation site (R1545V) and premature termination of translation at amino acid 1560.

There is significant overlap with features of benign condition, and neoplastic cells often occur in a reactive background. Recently, molecular techniques using paraffin-embedded tissue have been applied to the diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell infiltrates. These methods are useful for determining whether a clonal population of T-cells is present. The advantages and limitation of molecular diagnostic methods in the diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell infiltrates are discussed.

We describe 2 patients with long-standing immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation. Both patients had systemic symptoms that included fever, myalgia, and weight loss. Organ involvement and lymphadenopathy were not initially observed. Unique to these 2 cases are the initial leukemic symptoms, which led to further characterization and identification of NK-like T-cell malignancies. Both patients atypical blastic granular lymphocytes. Clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor genes was detected in both patients. In 1 patient, a cytogenetic abnormality involving 8q24 was demonstrated. The disease course in both patients was aggressive, with involvement of multiple sites and rapid demise. This study emphasizes the importance of including NK-like T-cell malignancies in the differential diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders associated with immunosuppression and recognizing that an aggressive clinical course may follow leukemic presentation of disease.

They also involve other extranodal sites, including the skin. Primary cutaneous manifestations of NK and NK-like T-cell lymphomas are uncommon, and the clinicopathologic features are poorly understood. We have studied 12 patients of varied ethnic backgrounds with CD56-positive lymphomas in the skin. Six patients subsequently progressed to disseminated disease. These lymphomas showed gene rearrangements supporting a T-cell origin for these lymphomas, whereas the remaining 10 cases were likely derived from NK cells. Our results show inconsistent association of these lymphomas with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the multidrug resistance phenotype, and expression of P53. In addition, we found a previously unreported correlation between lymphomas harboring EBV mRNA and the expression of the multidrug resistance phenotype. These lymphomas were aggressive and were associated with rapid clinical progression, treatment failure, multiple relapses, and an average survival of 15 months from the time of diagnosis. Our results indicate the importance of recognizing this disease as a distinct subset of aggressive cutaneous lymphomas that may be diagnosed on the basis of morphology, immunophenotype, and gene rearrangement studies.

Despite postoperative DVT prophylaxis, 20-50% of THA patients still develop DVT. Currently, there is no accurate way of predicting which patients will develop DVT despite standard prophylaxis. The presence of factor V Leiden is the most common cause of inherited DVT risk. It has been postulated that patients who have factor V Leiden and are subjected to thrombogenic stressors such as THA would have an increased risk of thrombosis. The factor V Leiden genotype of 36 patients who developed proximal DVT after surgery and 45 control patients who had THA but did not develop DVT was determined. All patients had had prophylaxis against thrombosis using intermittent pneumatic compression alone or in combination with warfarin or aspirin. Surveillance for proximal DVT was performed on all patients prior to discharge by duplex ultrasound. The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, and type of operation. Three of 36 study patients who had developed DVT (8%) and 2 of 45 control patients who had not developed DVT (4%) were heterozygotes for factor V Leiden; these prevalences were not statistically different. Heterozygosity for factor V Leiden is not associated with DVT prophylaxis failure in patients undergoing THA.

Currently, the determination of factor V Leiden genotype is limited to laboratories with expertise in molecular methods to develop \"home brew\" assays using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify genomic DNA, followed by analysis of Mnl I restriction fragments. These methods are not standardized, are labor intensive, and have low throughput. We describe a method for determination of factor V Leiden genotype using allele-specific oligonucleotide capture probes coated onto 96 well plates, requiring only a thermal cycler and a microplate spectrophotometer to perform. With an automated strip washer and plate reader, genotypes could be determined in 80 min from completion of PCR. Within-run and between-run coefficients of variation for the assay were < 10%. In all 160 cases studied, the microplate assay correctly identified the factor V genotype. The microplate oligonucleotide hybridization assay is a simple and reliable system for determination of factor V Leiden genotype. The assay offers an automatable, high-throughput alternative to current testing methodologies.

This cross-linking hybridization assay included two allele-specific capture probes and six signal-generating reporter probes; all were modified with a photoactivated cross-linking compound. By using two different capture probes complementary to a 16-base sequence at the factor V Leiden mutation site, but differing in the nucleotide opposite the mutation site (C vs T), wild-type and factor V Leiden alleles were differentiated in purified DNA specimens. The assay was also successfully applied to genomic DNA in leukocytes isolated from whole blood; the factor V status of 122 patients as determined by this method was in complete concordance with a standard PCR-based assay and clearly discriminated between healthy individuals and factor V Leiden heterozygotes.

The diagnosis of HIT requires clinical suspicion and laboratory confirmation. Although the \"gold-standard\" diagnostic test is considered to be the serotonin release assay (SRA), most laboratories use heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA), which is highly specific but reported to be less sensitive than the SRA. Recently, the heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been reported to have comparable sensitivity to the SRA. We compared the HIPA and PF4 ELISA in serum samples from 146 patients examined for HIT and assessed whether either test predicted thrombotic risk. Results for 81 patients were positive for HIPA, PF4 ELISA, or both. Of these, 91% were HIPA-positive, while only 60% were PF4 ELISA-positive. Clinical information was available on 63 patients, 17 of whom had thrombotic events (10 venous, 6 arterial, and 1 both). Neither the HIPA nor the PF4 ELISA predicted thrombotic risk, but the HIPA proved to be a more sensitive test for laboratory confirmation.

A synthetic CD31 peptide based on human CD31 epitope (amino acids 551 to 574) recognized by LYP21 is equally effective in inhibiting the MLR. In this study, we used the murine homolog of CD31 peptide 551 to 574 and a control peptide to study the role of CD31 molecule on T-cell activation. In vitro, CD31 peptide inhibited the MLR across several major and minor histocompatibility differences in a specific and dose-dependent fashion, similar to the results observed in the human system. Maximal inhibition was achieved at a dose of cytotoxic in vivo effect of this peptide, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) across minor or control peptide (100 microg/d) intraperitoneally (IP) for the first 5 weeks. CD31 peptide delayed onset of graft-versus-host disease and significantly increased long-term survival. Twelve of 14 mice receiving CD31 peptide survived more than 100 days after transplantation, as compared with none of 10 mice receiving PBS and none of five mice receiving control peptide (P = .0001). Long-term engraftment of allogeneic bone marrow was documented in all transplanted mice by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of microsatellite region in the interleukin (IL)-1beta gene. Our data suggest that the CD31 molecule has an important functional role in T-cell activation in vitro and in vivo.

The partial thromboplastin time (PTT)-based test for resistance to APC has been widely employed as a screening test for this disorder. However, the utility of this test for screening is not well characterized. More than 90% of patients with resistance to APC have the G1691A mutation in factor V (factor V Leiden). The authors studied the ability of a commercial APC resistance assay to correctly identify the factor V Leiden genotype in 130 individuals. At the recommended assay cut-off value of 2, the sensitivity of the APC resistance assay was 50%, with a specificity of 98%. Increasing the cut-off value increased the sensitivity but decreased the specificity of the test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the test was of intermediate utility. There was considerable overlap in APC ratios in the range of 2 to 3 between subjects with a normal factor V genotype and heterozygotes for factor V Leiden. The authors conclude that the APC resistance assay in its present form is not a useful screening test for factor V Leiden heterozygotes. Until the performance of this assay is improved, patients should have molecular diagnostic testing performed to determine their factor V Leiden status.

We describe for the first time a family in which two independent defects in factor V co-exist: heterozygosity for factor V Leiden and factor V deficiency. Compound heterozygosity for these two defects results in a phenotype similar to a homozygous factor V Leiden state with profound resistance to APC and recurrent thrombosis.

We sought to determine whether the CD31 adhesion molecule is a minor alloantigen.We directly sequenced samples of complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding CD31 molecules from 21 unrelated normal subjects. Sequence-specific primers were then designed to amplify alleles by the polymerase chain reaction, thereby permitting CD31 typing of genomic DNA from additional normal subjects. To assess the relevance of CD31 matching to bone marrow transplantation, we performed CD31 typing of 46 recipients of bone marrow (32 without GVHD and 14 with severe [grade III or IV] acute GVHD) and their CD31 flow cytometry.Direct sequencing of cDNA for CD31 from the 21 normal identified a single polymorphism, CTG-->GTG (Leu-->Val), at codon 125; we and CD31.V, respectively. The CD31 genotypes of these and 142 other unrelated subjects were of the expected frequencies. Among the transplant recipients, 71 percent of those with acute GVHD had CD31 genotypes that were not identical to the donor's genotype, as compared with 22 percent of the recipients without GVHD (P = 0.004). The binding of anti-CD31 monoclonal antibodies as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting correlated with the CD31 types of homozygous cell lines.The adhesion molecule CD31 is polymorphic. When donor and recipient genotypes are not identical, the risk of GVHD increases. Prospective CD31 typing may reduce the risk of acute GVHD.

Lymphocyte expression of CD31 is most closely associated with the CD45RA+CD8+ naive T phenotype. CD31 has recently been shown to play a role in leukocyte egress to inflammatory sites. The mechanism of CD31 adhesion remains under investigation. Several investigators have reported evidence for a heterotypic ligand. We have previously shown that CD31 is phosphorylated with cell activation, which suggests a possible role for CD31 in cell activation events. We therefore studied the effects of CD31 antibodies on in vitro assays of lymphocyte activation. One CD31 antibody, LYP21, inhibited the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in a specific and dose-dependent fashion. An LYP21 epitope was localized to the sixth Ig domain of CD31. This peptide and a scrambled control peptide were synthesized and used to study effects of this epitope on lymphocyte activation. The CD31 peptide strongly inhibited the MLR. Because CD31 is expressed on both stimulator and responder populations, stimulator peripheral blood leukocytes and responder lymphocyte populations were separately incubated with CD31 peptide or control peptide and then washed before mixing. The CD31 peptide inhibited the MLR equally when either stimulator or responder cells were preincubated with the CD31 peptide. We further sorted responder cells into CD31-high and CD31-low populations and separately incubated these subsets with peptides. The CD31 peptide strongly inhibited MLRs, regardless of level of responder-cell CD31 expression. Examination of MLR reactions involving the CD31 peptide showed dispersed small aggregates of cells, rather than the single large aggregate observed in control MLRs. The CD31 peptide did not affect activation of lymphocytes by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. These results suggest that a surface CD31-ligand interaction may have a functional role in alloimmune lymphocyte activation and identify a functionally important domain of CD31.

Northern analysis revealed three major mRNA transcripts in Jurkat (a human T cell line) and K562 and HEL (leukemia cell lines) cells with an additional 5.3-kilobase transcript seen in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Following T cell activation, CD31 mRNA was down-regulated by Northern analysis, and decreased CD31 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblots. The down-regulation of CD31 was partially mediated by decreased transcription as demonstrated by nuclear run-on studies. CD31 became rapidly phosphorylated in platelets, Jurkat cells, and endothelial cells after cell activation. We were unable to demonstrate the presence of a phosphotyrosine in CD31 using monoclonal and polyclonal phosphotyrosine antibodies. In CD31 phosphorylation in platelets was induced by phorbol ester and was blocked by staurosporin, a protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting that CD31 phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase C and involves serine and/or threonine residues. The phosphorylation of CD31 following cell activation may modulate its cellular adhesiveness, and the down-regulation of its expression may serve to impart target specificity and to localize effector lymphocytes to areas of inflammation.

Mixing studies with normal plasma failed to correct the clotting times. Platelet transfusions, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies were ineffective, but plasmapheresis was effective in decreasing clotting times and in the resolution of clinical bleeding events. The patient's purified IgG reacted with bovine thrombin by immunoblotting immunosorbent (ELISA). However, the IgG reacted minimally with human thrombin. In view of the severe bleeding, a coexisting inhibitor was sought. The patient's factor V activity was 1% of normal and was not corrected by mixing with normal plasma, demonstrating the presence of an inhibitor against factor V. The patient's IgG reacted with both bovine and human factor V. Immunoblotting localized the site of antibody binding to the light chain of activated bovine factor V. Detectable amounts of bovine factor V were found in commercial bovine thrombin preparations by ELISA. The data suggest that patients exposed to topical bovine thrombin may develop antibodies to thrombin and factor V. Anti-thrombin antibodies may mask coexisting factor V inhibitors responsible for clinical bleeding.
