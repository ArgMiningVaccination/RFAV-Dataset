CHAPTER 3 STREAMLINIING OF BUILDING PLAN APPROVALS 3.1 Clearances at Master Plan level : Individual construction proposals should not generally require separate clearances from various authorities each time. Such clearances should be integrated into the DCR of the Master/Development Plan of the concerned city. The areas unaffected by any of th e restrictions should be clearly marked out and mapped on a GIS platform. Area zones of differential control regulations (within the city) by any of these agencies may also be mapped accordingly. This will result in a composite map of the city with various control regulations as per the various agencies clearly marked on the map. Thus, the sites which are located outside these restricted/regulated areas would not require clearance from the respective authorities, thereby reducing the clearance 50 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 process signi ficantly. Following are the clearances which should be integrated into the city Master Plan :\u2014 Table 3\u20141: Minimum Clearances from various agencies proposed to be integrated in Master Plans S. No. Name of Agency Type of Clearance Area of Influence 1 National Monuments Authority through Local BPIA Ancient Monument approval As prescribed in the AMASAR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010 for protection of monuments. And J&K Archaeology /Heritage Preservation Act 2 Ministry of Environment , Forest and Climate Change Environment Clearance (EC) As prescribed in the statutory provisions for EIA and clearance based on the size of the project in accordance with Environment P rotection Act, 1986 3 Central Ground Water Authority through Local BPIA Bore -well Registration Certificate As per Guidelines/criteria for evaluation of proposals /requests for Ground Water Abstraction, 2012 4 Ministry of Civil Aviation AAI Height .

Some of the options which can reduce the time taken for various procedures are: \u2014 a) Online sanctions : ULBs/Development Authorities have introduced online sanction for issuing building plan and completion certificate. The process involves use of software tools for sc rutiny of building plans. All the documents are required to be submitted electronically using a portal. In case the building plans do not conf orm to the DCR the deviations are listed out in form of a report and intimated to the applicant/engaged Competent Professional for building plan design, vide an online ID in his account. b) Empowering Professionals : Empowering Competent Professionals as prescribed for building plan design will facilitate to streamline the procedure for obtaining approvals. The urban local body or urban local authority or by the Housing and Urban Development of the UT of J&K shall empanel such professionals based on their qualifications and track record. The empowered professionals can, also on behalf of developers/builders submit the documents required at the time of various clearances. This has been comprehensively defined in the Chapter 2. c) Creating a Cell in ULBs : There is a need for creating a specialized cell in ULBs and UDAs which is manned by qualified personnel conversant with the procedures and the interpretation o f development regulations. The c ell should be headed by a qualified Town Planner who should inter alia lead a team of Architects, Engineers, Environment Specialist and Legal Experts among others. The cell should hav e the dedicated provision for online submissions and conveying the online approvals as well. This will require robust software and hardware system capable of handling large digital files. d) Single Window System : All agencies involved in the process need to be integrated in a single electronic facility with proper coordination and monitoring of timelines. The 52 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 Municipal Corporation/Council /Committee needs to constitute teams comprising of experts from various agencies to be formed under the overall supervision of a Town Planner designated to assist developers /builders with complex projects and to constantly improve the sanction process by cutting dow n delays. e) Integration of agencies outside the ULBs for online clearances : Various agencies like AAI, NMA, SUAC, Fire Services, Department of Industries, Ministry of Defence , etc. grant NOC clearance to the building plans in certain specific cases. This ma y be streamlined for Ease of Doing Business by following 2 directions as given below :\u2014 i. Building permission for specific areas /sizes are to be examined by the external agencies. These areas should be plotted on GIS based colour -coded map which may be made a vailable in the public domain on the agency 's webs ite, with clearly identified co ordinates so that building falling only in these areas need to approach the concerned agencies for obtaining clearances. These maps may also be made available on the website o f the concerned municipal b odies. ii. The external agencies also need to develop online clearance/NOC application systems which should suitably be integrated with the online building approval systems of the municipal bodies. The two systems should be so compat ible that the building plans submitted to the local bodies may after scrutinizing with colour -coded zoning maps shall be e -transmitted to the external agencies. The agency concerned should give clearance within a period of maximum of 10 days with no requir ement of applicant to physically visit the offices of the agencies. The NOC may again be e -transmitted to the concerned local body on the building permission system so that the ULB shall use those for final approval. No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. 53 3.3 Development of an IT enabled team to op erate the Building Permission Online : a) The IT person shall be able to analyse and identify the issues regarding the building permit in the existing system as well as for the system of Single Window Clearance to be adopted in the future . b) The IT team shall enable a preview selection mode so that the applicants after submitting all the documents can preview it before final submission in the existing online system . c) The IT team shall also add the total ti me-frame for clearance at each step in the existing onlin e system dashboard . d) The IT person shall coordinate with various departments which issues NOCs and shall also identify the total time required in issuing it. e) Various issues in cross verifying the uploaded documents for e. g. uploading of digital s ignature, online payments, inspection etc. shall be listed in order to improve the existing online approval system as well as for shifting to the automated building approvals in the future . f) The physical submission of building permit documents shall be remo ved by introduction of Pre -DCR software to the applicants. g) The IT team shall enable online tracking system of NOCs if applicable through the existing online system for the applicants . h) The IT team shall provide a Pre -DCR formatted software to the consultant s (Architects/Engineers/Draftsman etc.) till the time automated building approval system is not introduced. i) The IT team shall issue an applicant no. through which if an applicant uploads the requisite documents thereafter after verification by the IT team can download the Occupancy Certificate. 3.4 Other Suggestions to enhance E ase of Doing Business : Some other suggestions, regarding Fast Track construction permits are \u2014 a) Citizens ' Charter : A Citizens ' charter lists out the timelines and upper limits of time for the delivery of citizen services of the organization. 54 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 The objective of issuing the charter is to improve the quality of public service in terms of timely delivery. Such charters shoul d be brought out by all municipalities to maintain high standards of accountability and transparency. The standards of service to be provided, the maximum number of days required for building approvals and the standards procedures should be listed out in t he citizens ' charter. Some states have gone a step further and introduced a C itizen Service Delivery Guarantee Act whereby the timelines prescribed by a citizen charter are made statutory and binding on officials. b) Capacity Building : Capacity building mea sures are to be adopted for such functionaries to identify Training Needs (TNA) and other technical requirement of duties that they are required to discharge. Fresh recruitments commensurate to the technical qualification /experience are to be made by the UT, if there is complete absence of the technical expertise needed for the said services. c) Empowered Committees : The Authorities may also consider constituting 'Empowered Committees ' or 'Peer Expert Groups ' for undertaking scrutiny and approval. This commi ttee can be manned as per the requirement and area of more than one municipality can be put under its jurisdiction. This has special significance for tall buildings. d) Simplification of Bye-laws : The B uilding Bye-laws have been simplified for easy comprehe nsion of lay person as well as professionals involved in developmental activities. The simplification process should also include the process of application, the filling up of forms and streamli ning the process of application.

Unless, the global surface temperature rise is restricted to no more than 2oC compared with pre- industrial levels, the IPCC has warned that the world will see irreversible catastrophic climate change . (b) India being a signatory to the UNFCCC, has pledged for efforts to assess the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of anthropogenic origin and removal by sinks. India 's per capita emissions are still considered low at 1.9 tonnes (2013), but its total emissions are next only to China and the US and is likely to overtake those of the EU by 2019. (c) While comparing the Indian cities for their emission scores, Delhi is on top as the biggest emitter at over 38. 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent overall emissions, followed by Greater Mumbai at 22.7 million tonnes and 134 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 Chennai at 22.1 million tonnes, Kolkata at 14.8 million tonnes, Bangalore at 19.8 million tonnes, Hyderabad at 13.7 million tonnes and Ahmedabad at 9 million tonnes were the other cities whose emissions for the year were calculated sector -wise. (d) As per the statistics of Transport Department (GNCTD), total number of vehicles in Delhi is more than the combined total vehicles in Mumbai , Chennai and Kolkata. Delhi has 85 private cars per 1000 population against the national average of 8 cars per 1000 population. In terms of Co2 emissions due to motor vehicles, Delhi emits about 12.4 million tonnes while the city of Bengaluru emits about 8.6 million tonnes . (e) Therefore, addressing the quantum of emissions from the \"Transport \" and \"Domestic \" sector emerges to be the high priority subjects under the overarching umbrella of \"Climate change mitigation \" as committed to the UNFCC. (f) Encouraging \"Electric Vehicles \" as a viable option for phased transportation in terms of short and long-distance trips with appropriate \"Charging Infrastructure \" is therefore, the pre-condition for this paradigm shift I phased migration to sustainable transportation . (g) For these changes are required in i nfrastructure provisions (at Regional and City level s) and in Development Control Regulations (in terms of provisions therein) to include the formulations of norms and standards for \"Charging Infrastructure \" in the said Master Plan Regulations and UT/State Building Regulations for adoption across the countr y suiting local conditions. 8.3 EV Charging Technology 8.3.1 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ( EVSE) : An EVSE is a wall mounted box that supplies electric energy for recharging of electric vehicle batteries. Also, EVSEs have a safety lock -out feature that does not allow current to flow from the device until the plug is physically inserted into the car. No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. 135 EVSEs can be customized with added features like \u2014 \u00b7 Authentication . \u00b7 Integrated payment gateways . \u00b7 Software for remote monitoring . As electric vehicle charging technology continues to advance, several standards and guidelines have become widely accepted across the industry. Chapter 8 gives a brief overview of charging infrastructure technology, standards, and terminology . 8.3.2 Different types of EVSE : (a) Charging speeds : Charging power, which determines the time required to charge a vehicle, can vary by orders of magnitude across charge points, as shown in Table 8.3. A small household outlet may charge as slowly as 1.2 K W, while the most advanced rapid charging stations can charge at up to 350 KW. Charging infrastructure is broadly broken into three categories based on speed: Level 1, Level 2, and direct current (DC) fast charging (sometimes referred to as Level 3). (Source: \"Emerging Best Practices for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure \", Oct., 2017) (b) Private Charging : Charging batteries of privately -owned cars through domestic charging points. Billing is mostly part of home domestic metering . (c) AC \"Slow \" Charging : The home private chargers are generally used with 230Vl15A single phase plug which can deliver a maximum of up to about 2.5KW of power. The EVSE supplies AC current to the vehicle's on -board charger which in turn converts the AC power to DC allowing the battery to be charged. (d) Public Charging : For charging outside the home premises, electric power needs to be billed and payment needs to be collected. The power drawn by these chargers may need to be managed from time to time. (e) DC \"Fast\" Charging : DC current is sent to the electric car's battery directly via the charge port. FC chargers (usually 50 KW or more) can supply 100 or more kilometres of range per hour of charging. The fast chargers would generally be used as a top -up, rather than fully 136 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 charging vehicles. These are important for cab companies and corporate users who have a fleet of electric cars. 8.4 Options for EV Charging : (a) There is an urgent need to offer flexible charging infrastructure for different vehicle segments to drive adoption of EVs. Charging infrastructure is the most crucial enabler in the entire EV value chain. The exploration of different charging models according to the local conditions shall enable faster deployment of electric vehicles in the country . (b) EV share in all vehicl es : It has been broadly projected that by the current rate of adoption of EVs , about 15% of all vehicles in the country would be EVs by the year-2020. Therefore, while assuming percentage composition of all proposed capacities in Public facilities of vehicle holding capacity, the Metropolitan and 'Tier I' cities will be assume d d to have a higher percentage share of EVs, say 20% for now. The charging infrastructure prescriptions in all urban development guidelines shall, therefore, be in consonance with the said percentage . (c) Power Load sanction to premises : While adding these Charging Infrastructures to the proposed set of building types of the Indian cities, enhanced Power Load shall have to be had for each such building type by the Power DISCOMs, commensurate to the total additional power requirement of simultaneous operation of all the prescribed charging points in the premise. With further advancement of charging technologies and the enhanced capacity of chargers to draw more power, it is advised that the load capacity assigned to each premise should be kept with a safety factor of 1.25 with a long -term vision of 30 years.

CHAPTER 10 RAINWATER HARVESTING This chapter gives the mandatory requirements of water conservation. The methods and techniques shall be adopted from NBC, 2016. 10.1 The Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system : The harvesting of rainwater simply involves the collection of water from surfaces on wh ich rain falls, and subsequently storing this water for use. The rainwater collected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into the underground aquifers. In scientific terms water harvesting (broadly) refers to collection and storage of rainwate r from the rooftops. This also restricts evaporation and seepage into building foundations. All buildings having a plot size of 100 sq.m. Or more, while submitting the building plans for sanction, shall mandatorily include the complete proposal of rainwate r harvesting. A rainwater harvesting system consis ts of\u2014 (a) Roof catchment ; (b) Gutters ; (c) Down pipes ; (d) Rainwater /Storm water drains ; No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. 165 (e) Filter Chamber ; (f) Storage Tanks /Pits/Sumps ; (g) Ground Water recharge structures like pit, trench, tube well or combination of above structure. Rainwater Harvesting is a way to capture the rain runoff, store that water above ground or charge the underground aquifers and use it later. This happens naturally in open rural areas. But in congested, over -paved metropolitan cities, ther e is a need to devise methods to capture the rainwater. The rainwater that is incident on the surface /rooftop is guided to bore wells or pits or new/old /abandoned wells through small dia meter pipes to recharge the underground water which can be used later whenever required. Rainwater can be harvested to the extent of 55,000 litres per 100 sq. m. area per Year from rooftops. 10.2 Rain water harvesting techniques: There are two main tech niques of rainwater harvestings \u2014 (a) Storage of rainwater on surface for future use. (b) Recharge to ground water. The technical aspects and options of Rainwater harvesting from which the city authorities can assess and choose to adopt (Refer Appendix for the technical aspects and options as suggested by Mo del Building Bye -Laws , 2016). 10.3 Harvesting provisions in various Building categories: All buildings in a city contribute to the rainwater runoff during the monsoon and hence such runoff can be harvested for water reuse /recharge. The indicative provisions of rainwater harvesting in various buildings types are: Table 10\u20141: Provisions for Rain water harvesting by building types Category Use Area of Plot (sq.m.)

CHAPTER 13 CLIMATE RESILIENT CONSTRUCTION -INTEGRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE WITH SANCTION Land, Air, Noise, Water, Energy, biological /socio - economic /solid /other waste management are the main facts considered in relation to Pre, during and Post. Building Construction for Sustainable Environment Management. Therefore, it is necessary for the building process to ensure compliance to various conditions laid down by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF and CC ). The building construction sector is a major contributor towards carbon footprints which affects climate change. India is committed towards mitigating the effects of climate change and moving towards internationally accepted norms for environmentally friendly building construction. Currently this objective of environmental safeguard is achieved through obtaining a specific environmental clearance (EC) for any construction project having a size of more than 20,000 sq. m . This is administered under notification of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. With rapid urbanisation and growth of Indian economy, it is anticipated that the construction activity will experience a proportionate growth. Government is also committed towards streamlining of clearances for buildings and real estate sector and empowering the urban local bodies with an objective of e ase of doing b usiness . 13.1 Environmental conditions for compliance during Building approvals : The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has now decided to integrate the environmental concerns into No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. 183 building plan approval process and empowering the concerned local body/development authority to approve and certify compliance of stipulated requirements. The new building construction proposals are classified in the following 3 categories :\u2014 (i) Conditions for Category 'A' Buildings: Built -up Area 5000 sq. m.-20000 sq. m. (ii) Conditions for Category 'B' Buildings: Built -up Area 20000 sq. m.-50000 sq. m. (iii) Conditions for Category 'C' Buildings: Built -up Area 50000 sq. m.-150000 sq. m. States are, therefore, advised to amend their building by -laws by incorporating the set of conditions for each category A, B and C as mentioned above either for the entire State /UT or clearly identified part thereof, where they would like to integrate the environmental clearance conditions with building permissions and empower the local auth ority to examine, stipulate and ensure compliance of conditions required to address environmental concerns the State /UT should submit such proposal/notification at draft stage as well as a copy of the final notification to the MoEF and CC. (a) For building plans with a total built-up area between 5,000 sqm . and 1, 50,000 sqm. and environment clearance will be required to be synchronized with the building regulations . (b) The concerned Urban local body, authorized to sanction building plans, shall ensure at the time of sanctioning a building plan that the environmental requirements stipulated in Table 16.1 (for above 5,000 sqm . and up to 20,000 sqm.), Table 12.2 (for above 20,000 sqm. and up to 50,000 sqm.) and Table 12.3 (for above 50,000 sqm. and up to 1,50,000 sqm.), as the case may be, are complied with. 184 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3.

These are constructed 1 to 2m, wide and to 3m. deep which are back filled with boulders, gravels, coarse sand. (b) Trenches .\u2014These are constructed when the permeable stream is available at shallow depth. Trench may be 0.5 to 1m. wide, 1 to 1.5m deep and 10 to 20m long depending up availabil ity of water. These are back filled with filler materials. (c) Dug wells .\u2014Existing dug wells may be utilized as recharge structure and water should pass through filter media before putting into dug well. (d) Hand pumps .\u2014The existing hand pumps may be used for recharging the shallow/deep aquifers, if the availability of water is limited. Water should pass through filter media before diverting it into hand pumps. (e) Recharge wells .\u2014Recharge wells of 100 to 300 mm. dia meter are generally constructed for recharging the de eper aquifers and water is passed through filter media to avoid choking of recharge wells. (f) Recharge Shafts .\u2014For recharging the shallow aquifer which are located below clayey surface, recharge shafts of 0.5 to 3 m. diameter and 10 to 15 m. deep are construc ted and back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse sand. (g) Lateral shafts with bore -wells .\u2014For recharging the upper as well as deeper aquifers lateral shafts of 1.5 to 2 m. wide & 10 to 30 m. long depending upon availability of water with one or two bore wells are constructed. The lateral shafts are back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse sand. (h) Spreading techniques .\u2014When permeable strata start from top then this techniqu e is used. Spread the water in S treams/Nala s by making check dams, na la bunds, cement plugs, gabion structures or a percolation pond may be constructed. \u2014\u2014\u2014 No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Agra ., 194 3. 225 Appendix \"F\" Number and Type of Lifts Required for Different Occupancies and Space for Electrical Installations 1.

Although, Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) occur in nature and thus have always been present on earth (Sun is the biggest source of natural EMR), nevertheless their occurrence has become more pronounced due to rapid advances of wireless technology in the commu nication sector. The twentieth century witnessed, steady rise of environmental exposure to man -made sources of EMF due to increasing electricity demand, ever -advancing wireless technologies and changes in work practices and social behaviour. The unpreceden ted growth in communication industry in recent years has also caused an exponential rise in electromagnetic radiations in the envelopes surrounding all living habitats. Human beings are thus exposed to a complex mix of electric and magnetic fields at many different frequencies, at home and at work. EMF (Electro Magnetic fiel ds) can be broadly divided into \u2014 1. Low-frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The common sources of which include power lines, household electrical appliances, and 2. High frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The main sources of which are radar, radio and television broadcasting, mobile telephones and their base stations, induction heaters and anti -theft devices etc . 230 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 Given below is the chart of Electromagnetic spectrum which highlights various ranges of frequencies and the equipment which work in these ranges of frequencies: \u2014 Figure G-1 Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt precautions for living beings from any effects of electromagnetic radiations at our work places as well as at our living spaces. Electromagnet ic Radiations : Effects o f Exposure : The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those on humans, depend upon the frequency as well as the penetrating power of the radiation. Initially, it was believed that low frequency fields were too weak to cause heating to a significant level and thus do not have any biological effect. There have been a number of epidemiological studies for a relationship between cell phone us e and consequent health threats that have been largely inconclusive. Thus, it can be concluded that their effect is not very prominent although significant. However, there are sufficient evidences to suggest the existence of No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. 231 complex biological effects of w eaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields, and modulated RF and microwave fields. World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as a possible group 2b carcinogen (possible weaker threats ). In case of low -frequency radiations (radio waves to visible light) therefore, depending upon the power of the radiation heating effects are caused due to absorption of radiation by the living cells. These thermal effects increase with the frequency of radi ation as penetration of radiation into the organism increases (for example microwaves penetrate more than infrared rays ). At higher frequencies (visible and beyond) however, the individual photons of the radiation carry enough energy individually and thus directly or indirectly can damage biological molecules. All frequencies of UV radiation have therefore been classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. In this context it is a significant fact that Ultraviolet radiation from sun exp osure is the primary cause of skin cancer. Thus, at such frequencies electromagnetic radiations cause much more damage to biological systems than simple heating. This is most obvious for the \"extreme \" Ultraviolet, X -ray and Gamma radiations, which are refe rred to as ionizing radiations due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials which include living tissues as well. Since such radiation can produce severe damage to life at powers that produce very little he ating, it is considered much more dangerous than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. Health risks from Electromagnetic radiations can be numerous depending upon the power and frequency of radiations . From the perspective of prevention of any health e ffects of Electro Magnetic Radiations there is a need of suitable precautions, since it is not possible to keep away from them owing to the advent of wireless communication technology which is based upon electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies besides many other applications like microwave, remote controlled toys, cordless phones, TV remotes, etc. 232 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 Guidelines for Buildings and Built forms mitigating effects of EMR : While planning a building or a residential complex /township, it is most desirable to list all probable equipment /appliance emitting Electromagnetic Radiations in order of ascending/descending intensities. These should also be categorized as per indoor and outdoor emissions. Their placement in the built space and surroundi ngs can then be decided based on certain premises . The most fundamental principal in this regard is that the effect of Electromagnetic Radiation decreases with increase in distance from radiation emitting source. It is thus advisable \u2014 \u00b7 To keep a safe distance from working electric and electronic equipment . \u00b7 Minimize the use of all equipment working on wireless technology like cordless phones, Wi -Fi, Bluetooth and the cell phones . \u00b7 Disconnect electric and electronic equipment from the power supply when not in use, especially in areas of prolonged occupancy . Further, the list of equipment/appliances generally used in and around working/living space is placed below for appreciation of EMR radiation: \u2014 1. RF Sources i.e. the transmitting towers suc h as AM/FM radio towers, TV towers, cell phone towers transmitting EMR continuously. 2. Cell phone which is ON but not in use also radiates and Wi Fi (Wireless Internet ). 3. Cordless phone . 4. Wi-max. 5. Other wireless devices . 6. CFL (Compact Florescent Light ) bulbs . 7. Neighbouring EMR sources that are located next to shared walls . 8. Computers and laptops . 9. Air conditioning systems . 10. Refrigerators . 11. Electrical heating systems /Microwave Ovens . 12. Power generators and voltage converters . 13. Stereo and home entertainment systems . 14. Fans . No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. 233 This list is only indicative and not exhaustive and there can be additions to it. From the view point of effective communication, providing of mobile towers in a township /office complex is an essential requirement and thus should be carefully planned. The mobile tower generates and transmits high frequency radiations; so more care is needed for their placement. It should be ensured that the building identified to mount the tower should be the tallest in the vicinity and should not have adjoining buildings o n which proposed or existing habitable floors are within close -range . OR Mobile Tower should be mounted on the highest sanctioned building in an area. In regular practice that many cellular operators mount their antenna on a single tower along with other o perators which increase the effects of EMR manifolds and should thus be avoided as far as possible. Else height . of the tower should be increased. Besides, Substation Equipment like Transformer, DG set etc. are also to be provided for fulfilling the bulk p ower requirement of the building and should be suitably placed for electrical safety as well as for mitigating effects of EMR. However, as these are low frequency devices, their placement is too decided more from electrical safety point of view than EMR. In addition, various light. sources inside the living/working spaces, UPS, servers, various other equipment running on Wi -Fi may also emit EMR. Hence their placement inside the building also needs careful consideration. Thus, in a built environment of consi derable human occupancy, following broad guidelines should be adopted for placement of utility equipment /appliances serving the building as a whole :\u2014 Equipment external to the building: Mobile Towers 234 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 Figure G-2 Location of communication towers is governed by radio frequency system adopted and as far as possible cellular operator should try to avoid residential areas. However, where it is not possible to avoid these, they should request for permission from the appropriate authority for installation on roof top of the tallest existing buildings \u2014 i. First preference should however, be given to the location of tower in the commercial areas or other public areas. ii. Where it is not possible to avoid the location of this tower in residential, area possibility should be explored to locate them in green belts within residential sectors or open spaces/community buildings in the sectors . Where it is not possible to find such suitable space mentioned at Sr. No. (ii) above, tower should be permitted on the roof top of residential buildings subject to the condition that a structural safety certificate from a certified Structural Engineer has been obtained. Such towers should not be permitted on occupied buildin gs, however if inevitable, a Steel /Metal frame of 6 m. height over the roof level of the last habitable floor of the building should be provided to accommodate the tower and its associated units. Structural stability of the said building should be calculat ed with the overall loading of such metal steel frames mounted atop and \"Structural stability certificate \" should be submitted by a registered structural engineer with the application for the permission of building (pre-design) or installation (post -design ). Transformers .\u2014In addition to the fenced ionized area around a transformer, neighbourhood level congregation activity areas should not be planned/permitted within 3 m of the fence. Diesel Generators .\u2014The location of the Generator within the Plot premises should not be adjacent to any habitable /community / recreational activity within a radius of 3 m. Indoor equipment/Appliances: Electrical Switchboards .\u2014Unless otherwise amended by Barrier - free access regulations to such fixtures, they should be mounted as per existing stipulations laid down in CPWD General Specifications for Electrical Works -Part I Internal 2013. No. 39 -4] The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. 235 Wireless Routers .\u2014 Within the housing unit, the vertical mounting height of the router should be not les s than 4 feet and should be kept in the Drawing /Dining zone and not within the zones of longer period of occupancy e.g. Bedrooms. In non -residential units i.e. office spaces these routers should be kept as much away as possible and should be switched off w hen not in use. Figure G-3 Server Room .\u2014Occupied Work -stations should be at least 5 m away from the server room or associated equipment. If people are sitting in the same room, they must wear protective gear and should not have prolonged exposure. Computer .\u2014Should be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space, it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. UPS.\u2014Should also be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. Mobile Phone .\u2014It usually remains with the user all the time. The only time it is kept away is when it is being charged. Thus mobile should be charged from a remotely located power point. It is thus preferable to provide a charging station in almost every working/living sp ace at a location, as far as permissible from living space considerations. Light sources .\u2014Usually, sun as a source of natural light is the biggest source of electromagnetic radiations. However, the atmosphere surrounding us provides a natural shield from electromagnetic radiations. In this context, the light sources used inside a living/working space should be given careful consideration 236 The J&K Official Gazette, 24th Dec., 2021/3rd Agra ., 194 3. [No. 39 -4 from the point of view of Electromagnetic Radiations. Man y luminaries available presently, like Fluorescent tubes, compa ct fluorescent lamps, LED lights etc. are used in working /living spaces. So, their use should not only be determined from the point of view of energy conservation but also from the point of view of Electromagnetic Radiations. For this purpose, recommendati ons of the manufacturers should serve as proper guidelines \u2014 Table G\u20141: below summarizes appropriate placement of equipment 's/appliances in the built environment :\u2014 Sr. No Equipment Minimum safe distance 1. Mobile Towers 6 m height over the roof level of the last habitable floor of the building. 2. Transformers 3 m 3. Electrical Switchboards No Change 4. Wireless Routers 4 feet (1.2 m) 5. Server Room 5 m 6. UPS 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 7. Diesel Generators Radius of 3 m 8. Mobile Phone 2 feet (0.6 m) 9. Computer 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 10. Laptop 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 11. UPS 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 12. Wireless Router modem 4 feet (1.2 m) 13. Server room 5 m away from workstations Note: \u2014Intensity of Electromagnetic Radiations decreases with increase in distance from the radiation source. So as to minimize exposure maximum possible distance should be kept. EXTRAORDINARY REGD NO.

CHAPTER 3 STREAMLINIING OF BUILDING PLAN APPROVALS 3.1 Clearances at Master Plan level : Individual construction proposals should not generally require separate clearances from various authorities each time. Such clearances should be integrated into the DCR of the Master/Development Plan of the concerned city. The areas unaffected by any of th e restrictions should be clearly marked out and mapped on a GIS platform. Area zones of differential control regulations (within the city) by any of these agencies may also be mapped accordingly. This will result in a composite map of the city with various control regulations as per the various agencies clearly marked on the map. Thus, the sites which are located outside these restricted/regulated areas would not require clearance from the respective authorities, thereby reducing the clearance 50 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -1 process signi ficantly. Following are the clearances which should be integrated into the city Master Plan :\u2014 Table 3\u20141: Minimum Clearances from various agencies proposed to be integrated in Master Plans S. No. Name of Agency Type of Clearance Area of Influence 1 National Monuments Authority through Local BPIA Ancient Monument approval As prescribed in the AMASAR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010 for protection of monuments. And J&K Archaeology /Heritage Preservation Act 2 Ministry of Environment , Forest and Climate Change Environment Clearance (EC) As prescribed in the statutory provisions for EIA and clearance based on the size of the project in accordance with Environment P rotection Act, 1986 3 Central Ground Water Authority through Local BPIA Bore -well Registration Certificate As per Guidelines/criteria for evaluation of proposals /requests for Ground Water Abstraction, 2012 4 Ministry of Civil Aviation AAI Height . NOC Critical and non-critical area as identified by AAI 5 Ministry of Defen ce Defence Clearance Areas in and around Defence Establishments as identified by MoD. 6 Ministry of Railways Area Clearance Buffer zones as prescribed by Railways along the Rail tracks/ depots/yards etc. 3.2 Options for reducing the timelines for approvals : The above suggested steps are only indicative, however, there is scope for streamlining the procedures for clearances to be obtained from various departments in the least possible number No. 36 -1] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 51 of procedures and number of days. Some of the options which can reduce the time taken for various procedures are: \u2014 a) Online sanctions : ULBs/Development Authorities have introduced online sanction for issuing building plan and completion certificate. The process involves use of software tools for sc rutiny of building plans. All the documents are required to be submitted electronically using a portal. In case the building plans do not conf orm to the DCR the deviations are listed out in form of a report and intimated to the applicant/engaged Competent Professional for building plan design, vide an online ID in his account. b) Empowering Professionals : Empowering Competent Professionals as prescribed for building plan design will facilitate to streamline the procedure for obtaining approvals. The urban local body or urban local authority or by the Housing and Urban Development of the UT of J&K shall empanel such professionals based on their qualifications and track record. The empowered professionals can, also on behalf of developers/builders submit the documents required at the time of various clearances. This has been comprehensively defined in the Chapter 2. c) Creating a Cell in ULBs : There is a need for creating a specialized cell in ULBs and UDAs which is manned by qualified personnel conversant with the procedures and the interpretation o f development regulations. The c ell should be headed by a qualified Town Planner who should inter alia lead a team of Architects, Engineers, Environment Specialist and Legal Experts among others. The cell should hav e the dedicated provision for online submissions and conveying the online approvals as well. This will require robust software and hardware system capable of handling large digital files. d) Single Window System : All agencies involved in the process need to be integrated in a single electronic facility with proper coordination and monitoring of timelines. The 52 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th ., 194 3. [No. 36 -1 Municipal Corporation/Council /Committee needs to constitute teams comprising of experts from various agencies to be formed under the overall supervision of a Town Planner designated to assist developers /builders with complex projects and to constantly improve the sanction process by cutting dow n delays. e) Integration of agencies outside the ULBs for online clearances : Various agencies like AAI, NMA, SUAC, Fire Services, Department of Industries, Ministry of Defence , etc. grant NOC clearance to the building plans in certain specific cases. This ma y be streamlined for Ease of Doing Business by following 2 directions as given below :\u2014 i. Building permission for specific areas /sizes are to be examined by the external agencies. These areas should be plotted on GIS based colour -coded map which may be made a vailable in the public domain on the agency 's webs ite, with clearly identified co ordinates so that building falling only in these areas need to approach the concerned agencies for obtaining clearances. These maps may also be made available on the website o f the concerned municipal b odies. ii. The external agencies also need to develop online clearance/NOC application systems which should suitably be integrated with the online building approval systems of the municipal bodies. The two systems should be so compat ible that the building plans submitted to the local bodies may after scrutinizing with colour -coded zoning maps shall be e -transmitted to the external agencies. The agency concerned should give clearance within a period of maximum of 10 days with no requir ement of applicant to physically visit the offices of the agencies. The NOC may again be e -transmitted to the concerned local body on the building permission system so that the ULB shall use those for final approval. No. 36 -1] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 53 3.3 Development of an IT enabled team to op erate the Building Permission Online : a) The IT person shall be able to analyse and identify the issues regarding the building permit in the existing system as well as for the system of Single Window Clearance to be adopted in the future . b) The IT team shall enable a preview selection mode so that the applicants after submitting all the documents can preview it before final submission in the existing online system . c) The IT team shall also add the total ti me-frame for clearance at each step in the existing onlin e system dashboard . d) The IT person shall coordinate with various departments which issues NOCs and shall also identify the total time required in issuing it. e) Various issues in cross verifying the uploaded documents for e. g. uploading of digital s ignature, online payments, inspection etc. shall be listed in order to improve the existing online approval system as well as for shifting to the automated building approvals in the future . f) The physical submission of building permit documents shall be remo ved by introduction of Pre -DCR software to the applicants. g) The IT team shall enable online tracking system of NOCs if applicable through the existing online system for the applicants . h) The IT team shall provide a Pre -DCR formatted software to the consultant s (Architects/Engineers/Draftsman etc.) till the time automated building approval system is not introduced. i) The IT team shall issue an applicant no. through which if an applicant uploads the requisite documents thereafter after verification by the IT team can download the Occupancy Certificate. 3.4 Other Suggestions to enhance E ase of Doing Business : Some other suggestions, regarding Fast Track construction permits are \u2014 a) Citizens ' Charter : A Citizens ' charter lists out the timelines and upper limits of time for the delivery of citizen services of the organization. 54 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -1 The objective of issuing the charter is to improve the quality of public service in terms of timely delivery. Such charters shoul d be brought out by all municipalities to maintain high standards of accountability and transparency. The standards of service to be provided, the maximum number of days required for building approvals and the standards procedures should be listed out in t he citizens ' charter. Some states have gone a step further and introduced a C itizen Service Delivery Guarantee Act whereby the timelines prescribed by a citizen charter are made statutory and binding on officials. b) Capacity Building : Capacity building mea sures are to be adopted for such functionaries to identify Training Needs (TNA) and other technical requirement of duties that they are required to discharge. Fresh recruitments commensurate to the technical qualification /experience are to be made by the UT, if there is complete absence of the technical expertise needed for the said services. c) Empowered Committees : The Authorities may also consider constituting 'Empowered Committees ' or 'Peer Expert Groups ' for undertaking scrutiny and approval. This commi ttee can be manned as per the requirement and area of more than one municipality can be put under its jurisdiction. This has special significance for tall buildings. d) Simplification of Bye-laws : The B uilding Bye-laws have been simplified for easy comprehe nsion of lay person as well as professionals involved in developmental activities. The simplification process should also include the process of application, the filling up of forms and streamli ning the process of application.

(d) As per the statistics of Transport Department (GNCTD), total number of vehicles in Delhi is more than the combined total vehicles in Mumbai , Chennai and Kolkata. Delhi has 85 private cars per 1000 population against the national average of 8 cars per 1000 population. In terms of Co2 emissions due to motor vehicles, Delhi emits about 12.4 million tonnes while the city of Bengaluru emits about 8.6 million tonnes . (e) Therefore, addressing the quantum of emissions from the \"Transport \" and \"Domestic \" sector emerges to be the high priority subjects under the overarching umbrella of \"Climate change mitigation \" as committed to the UNFCC. (f) Encouraging \"Electric Vehicles \" as a viable option for phased transportation in terms of short and long-distance trips with appropriate \"Charging Infrastructure \" is therefore, the pre-condition for this paradigm shift I phased migration to sustainable transportation . (g) For these changes are required in i nfrastructure provisions (at Regional and City level s) and in Development Control Regulations (in terms of provisions therein) to include the formulations of norms and standards for \"Charging Infrastructure \" in the said Master Plan Regulations and UT/State Building Regulations for adoption across the countr y suiting local conditions. 8.3 EV Charging Technology 8.3.1 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ( EVSE) : An EVSE is a wall mounted box that supplies electric energy for recharging of electric vehicle batteries. Also, EVSEs have a safety lock -out feature that does not allow current to flow from the device until the plug is physically inserted into the car. No. 36 -1] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 135 EVSEs can be customized with added features like \u2014 \u00b7 Authentication . \u00b7 Integrated payment gateways . \u00b7 Software for remote monitoring . As electric vehicle charging technology continues to advance, several standards and guidelines have become widely accepted across the industry. Chapter 8 gives a brief overview of charging infrastructure technology, standards, and terminology . 8.3.2 Different types of EVSE : (a) Charging speeds : Charging power, which determines the time required to charge a vehicle, can vary by orders of magnitude across charge points, as shown in Table 8.3. A small household outlet may charge as slowly as 1.2 K W, while the most advanced rapid charging stations can charge at up to 350 KW. Charging infrastructure is broadly broken into three categories based on speed: Level 1, Level 2, and direct current (DC) fast charging (sometimes referred to as Level 3). (Source: \"Emerging Best Practices for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure \", Oct., 2017) (b) Private Charging : Charging batteries of privately -owned cars through domestic charging points. Billing is mostly part of home domestic metering . (c) AC \"Slow \" Charging : The home private chargers are generally used with 230Vl15A single phase plug which can deliver a maximum of up to about 2.5KW of power. The EVSE supplies AC current to the vehicle's on -board charger which in turn converts the AC power to DC allowing the battery to be charged. (d) Public Charging : For charging outside the home premises, electric power needs to be billed and payment needs to be collected. The power drawn by these chargers may need to be managed from time to time. (e) DC \"Fast\" Charging : DC current is sent to the electric car's battery directly via the charge port. FC chargers (usually 50 KW or more) can supply 100 or more kilometres of range per hour of charging. The fast chargers would generally be used as a top -up, rather than fully 136 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -1 charging vehicles. These are important for cab companies and corporate users who have a fleet of electric cars. 8.4 Options for EV Charging : (a) There is an urgent need to offer flexible charging infrastructure for different vehicle segments to drive adoption of EVs. Charging infrastructure is the most crucial enabler in the entire EV value chain. The exploration of different charging models according to the local conditions shall enable faster deployment of electric vehicles in the country . (b) EV share in all vehicl es : It has been broadly projected that by the current rate of adoption of EVs , about 15% of all vehicles in the country would be EVs by the year-2020. Therefore, while assuming percentage composition of all proposed capacities in Public facilities of vehicle holding capacity, the Metropolitan and 'Tier I' cities will be assume d d to have a higher percentage share of EVs, say 20% for now. The charging infrastructure prescriptions in all urban development guidelines shall, therefore, be in consonance with the said percentage . (c) Power Load sanction to premises : While adding these Charging Infrastructures to the proposed set of building types of the Indian cities, enhanced Power Load shall have to be had for each such building type by the Power DISCOMs, commensurate to the total additional power requirement of simultaneous operation of all the prescribed charging points in the premise. With further advancement of charging technologies and the enhanced capacity of chargers to draw more power, it is advised that the load capacity assigned to each premise should be kept with a safety factor of 1.25 with a long -term vision of 30 years.

CHAPTER 10 RAINWATER HARVESTING This chapter gives the mandatory requirements of water conservation. The methods and techniques shall be adopted from NBC, 2016. 10.1 The Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system : The harvesting of rainwater simply involves the collection of water from surfaces on wh ich rain falls, and subsequently storing this water for use. The rainwater collected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into the underground aquifers. In scientific terms water harvesting (broadly) refers to collection and storage of rainwate r from the rooftops. This also restricts evaporation and seepage into building foundations. All buildings having a plot size of 100 sq.m. Or more, while submitting the building plans for sanction, shall mandatorily include the complete proposal of rainwate r harvesting. A rainwater harvesting system consis ts of\u2014 (a) Roof catchment ; (b) Gutters ; (c) Down pipes ; (d) Rainwater /Storm water drains ; No. 36 -1] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 165 (e) Filter Chamber ; (f) Storage Tanks /Pits/Sumps ; (g) Ground Water recharge structures like pit, trench, tube well or combination of above structure. Rainwater Harvesting is a way to capture the rain runoff, store that water above ground or charge the underground aquifers and use it later. This happens naturally in open rural areas. But in congested, over -paved metropolitan cities, ther e is a need to devise methods to capture the rainwater. The rainwater that is incident on the surface /rooftop is guided to bore wells or pits or new/old /abandoned wells through small dia meter pipes to recharge the underground water which can be used later whenever required. Rainwater can be harvested to the extent of 55,000 litres per 100 sq. m. area per Year from rooftops. 10.2 Rain water harvesting techniques: There are two main tech niques of rainwater harvestings \u2014 (a) Storage of rainwater on surface for future use. (b) Recharge to ground water. The technical aspects and options of Rainwater harvesting from which the city authorities can assess and choose to adopt (Refer Appendix for the technical aspects and options as suggested by Mo del Building Bye -Laws , 2016). 10.3 Harvesting provisions in various Building categories: All buildings in a city contribute to the rainwater runoff during the monsoon and hence such runoff can be harvested for water reuse /recharge. The indicative provisions of rainwater harvesting in various buildings types are: Table 10\u20141: Provisions for Rain water harvesting by building types Category Use Area of Plot (sq.m.)

Building Construction for Sustainable Environment Management. Therefore, it is necessary for the building process to ensure compliance to various conditions laid down by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF and CC ). The building construction sector is a major contributor towards carbon footprints which affects climate change. India is committed towards mitigating the effects of climate change and moving towards internationally accepted norms for environmentally friendly building construction. Currently this objective of environmental safeguard is achieved through obtaining a specific environmental clearance (EC) for any construction project having a size of more than 20,000 sq. m . This is administered under notification of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. With rapid urbanisation and growth of Indian economy, it is anticipated that the construction activity will experience a proportionate growth. Government is also committed towards streamlining of clearances for buildings and real estate sector and empowering the urban local bodies with an objective of e ase of doing b usiness . 13.1 Environmental conditions for compliance during Building approvals : The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has now decided to integrate the environmental concerns into No. 36 -1] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 183 building plan approval process and empowering the concerned local body/development authority to approve and certify compliance of stipulated requirements.

Although, Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) occur in nature and thus have always been present on earth (Sun is the biggest source of natural EMR), nevertheless their occurrence has become more pronounced due to rapid advances of wireless technology in the commu nication sector. The twentieth century witnessed, steady rise of environmental exposure to man -made sources of EMF due to increasing electricity demand, ever -advancing wireless technologies and changes in work practices and social behaviour. The unpreceden ted growth in communication industry in recent years has also caused an exponential rise in electromagnetic radiations in the envelopes surrounding all living habitats. Human beings are thus exposed to a complex mix of electric and magnetic fields at many different frequencies, at home and at work. EMF (Electro Magnetic fiel ds) can be broadly divided into \u2014 1. Low-frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The common sources of which include power lines, household electrical appliances, and 2. High frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The main sources of which are radar, radio and television broadcasting, mobile telephones and their base stations, induction heaters and anti -theft devices etc . 230 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -1 Given below is the chart of Electromagnetic spectrum which highlights various ranges of frequencies and the equipment which work in these ranges of frequencies: \u2014 Figure G-1 Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt precautions for living beings from any effects of electromagnetic radiations at our work places as well as at our living spaces. Electromagnet ic Radiations : Effects o f Exposure : The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those on humans, depend upon the frequency as well as the penetrating power of the radiation. Initially, it was believed that low frequency fields were too weak to cause heating to a significant level and thus do not have any biological effect. There have been a number of epidemiological studies for a relationship between cell phone us e and consequent health threats that have been largely inconclusive. Thus, it can be concluded that their effect is not very prominent although significant. However, there are sufficient evidences to suggest the existence of No. 36 -1] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 231 complex biological effects of w eaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields, and modulated RF and microwave fields. World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as a possible group 2b carcinogen (possible weaker threats ). In case of low -frequency radiations (radio waves to visible light) therefore, depending upon the power of the radiation heating effects are caused due to absorption of radiation by the living cells. These thermal effects increase with the frequency of radi ation as penetration of radiation into the organism increases (for example microwaves penetrate more than infrared rays ). At higher frequencies (visible and beyond) however, the individual photons of the radiation carry enough energy individually and thus directly or indirectly can damage biological molecules. All frequencies of UV radiation have therefore been classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. In this context it is a significant fact that Ultraviolet radiation from sun exp osure is the primary cause of skin cancer. Thus, at such frequencies electromagnetic radiations cause much more damage to biological systems than simple heating. This is most obvious for the \"extreme \" Ultraviolet, X -ray and Gamma radiations, which are refe rred to as ionizing radiations due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials which include living tissues as well. Since such radiation can produce severe damage to life at powers that produce very little he ating, it is considered much more dangerous than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. Health risks from Electromagnetic radiations can be numerous depending upon the power and frequency of radiations . From the perspective of prevention of any health e ffects of Electro Magnetic Radiations there is a need of suitable precautions, since it is not possible to keep away from them owing to the advent of wireless communication technology which is based upon electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies besides many other applications like microwave, remote controlled toys, cordless phones, TV remotes, etc. 232 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -1 Guidelines for Buildings and Built forms mitigating effects of EMR : While planning a building or a residential complex /township, it is most desirable to list all probable equipment /appliance emitting Electromagnetic Radiations in order of ascending/descending intensities. These should also be categorized as per indoor and outdoor emissions. Their placement in the built space and surroundi ngs can then be decided based on certain premises . The most fundamental principal in this regard is that the effect of Electromagnetic Radiation decreases with increase in distance from radiation emitting source. It is thus advisable \u2014 \u00b7 To keep a safe distance from working electric and electronic equipment . \u00b7 Minimize the use of all equipment working on wireless technology like cordless phones, Wi -Fi, Bluetooth and the cell phones . \u00b7 Disconnect electric and electronic equipment from the power supply when not in use, especially in areas of prolonged occupancy . Further, the list of equipment/appliances generally used in and around working/living space is placed below for appreciation of EMR radiation: \u2014 1. RF Sources i.e. the transmitting towers suc h as AM/FM radio towers, TV towers, cell phone towers transmitting EMR continuously. 2. Cell phone which is ON but not in use also radiates and Wi Fi (Wireless Internet ). 3. Cordless phone . 4. Wi-max. 5. Other wireless devices . 6. CFL (Compact Florescent Light ) bulbs . 7. Neighbouring EMR sources that are located next to shared walls . 8. Computers and laptops . 9. Air conditioning systems . 10. Refrigerators . 11. Electrical heating systems /Microwave Ovens . 12. Power generators and voltage converters . 13. Stereo and home entertainment systems . 14. Fans . No. 36 -1] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 233 This list is only indicative and not exhaustive and there can be additions to it. From the view point of effective communication, providing of mobile towers in a township /office complex is an essential requirement and thus should be carefully planned. The mobile tower generates and transmits high frequency radiations; so more care is needed for their placement. It should be ensured that the building identified to mount the tower should be the tallest in the vicinity and should not have adjoining buildings o n which proposed or existing habitable floors are within close -range . OR Mobile Tower should be mounted on the highest sanctioned building in an area. In regular practice that many cellular operators mount their antenna on a single tower along with other o perators which increase the effects of EMR manifolds and should thus be avoided as far as possible. Else height . of the tower should be increased. Besides, Substation Equipment like Transformer, DG set etc. are also to be provided for fulfilling the bulk p ower requirement of the building and should be suitably placed for electrical safety as well as for mitigating effects of EMR. However, as these are low frequency devices, their placement is too decided more from electrical safety point of view than EMR. In addition, various light. sources inside the living/working spaces, UPS, servers, various other equipment running on Wi -Fi may also emit EMR. Hence their placement inside the building also needs careful consideration. Thus, in a built environment of consi derable human occupancy, following broad guidelines should be adopted for placement of utility equipment /appliances serving the building as a whole :\u2014 Equipment external to the building: Mobile Towers 234 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -1 Figure G-2 Location of communication towers is governed by radio frequency system adopted and as far as possible cellular operator should try to avoid residential areas. However, where it is not possible to avoid these, they should request for permission from the appropriate authority for installation on roof top of the tallest existing buildings \u2014 i. First preference should however, be given to the location of tower in the commercial areas or other public areas. ii. Where it is not possible to avoid the location of this tower in residential, area possibility should be explored to locate them in green belts within residential sectors or open spaces/community buildings in the sectors . Where it is not possible to find such suitable space mentioned at Sr. No. (ii) above, tower should be permitted on the roof top of residential buildings subject to the condition that a structural safety certificate from a certified Structural Engineer has been obtained. Such towers should not be permitted on occupied buildin gs, however if inevitable, a Steel /Metal frame of 6 m. height over the roof level of the last habitable floor of the building should be provided to accommodate the tower and its associated units. Structural stability of the said building should be calculat ed with the overall loading of such metal steel frames mounted atop and \"Structural stability certificate \" should be submitted by a registered structural engineer with the application for the permission of building (pre-design) or installation (post -design ). Transformers .\u2014In addition to the fenced ionized area around a transformer, neighbourhood level congregation activity areas should not be planned/permitted within 3 m of the fence. Diesel Generators .\u2014The location of the Generator within the Plot premises should not be adjacent to any habitable /community / recreational activity within a radius of 3 m. Indoor equipment/Appliances: Electrical Switchboards .\u2014Unless otherwise amended by Barrier - free access regulations to such fixtures, they should be mounted as per existing stipulations laid down in CPWD General Specifications for Electrical Works -Part I Internal 2013.

In non -residential units i.e. office spaces these routers should be kept as much away as possible and should be switched off w hen not in use. Figure G-3 Server Room .\u2014Occupied Work -stations should be at least 5 m away from the server room or associated equipment. If people are sitting in the same room, they must wear protective gear and should not have prolonged exposure. Computer .\u2014Should be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space, it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. UPS.\u2014Should also be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. Mobile Phone .\u2014It usually remains with the user all the time. The only time it is kept away is when it is being charged. Thus mobile should be charged from a remotely located power point. It is thus preferable to provide a charging station in almost every working/living sp ace at a location, as far as permissible from living space considerations. Light sources .\u2014Usually, sun as a source of natural light is the biggest source of electromagnetic radiations. However, the atmosphere surrounding us provides a natural shield from electromagnetic radiations. In this context, the light sources used inside a living/working space should be given careful consideration 236 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3.

CHAPTER 3 STREAMLINIING OF BUILDING PLAN APPROVALS 3.1 Clearances at Master Plan level : Individual construction proposals should not generally require separate clearances from various authorities each time. Such clearances should be integrated into the DCR of the Master/Development Plan of the concerned city. The areas unaffected by any of th e restrictions should be clearly marked out and mapped on a GIS platform. Area zones of differential control regulations (within the city) by any of these agencies may also be mapped accordingly. This will result in a composite map of the city with various control regulations as per the various agencies clearly marked on the map. Thus, the sites which are located outside these restricted/regulated areas would not require clearance from the respective authorities, thereby reducing the clearance 50 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 process signi ficantly.

Some of the options which can reduce the time taken for various procedures are: \u2014 a) Online sanctions : ULBs/Development Authorities have introduced online sanction for issuing building plan and completion certificate. The process involves use of software tools for sc rutiny of building plans. All the documents are required to be submitted electronically using a portal. In case the building plans do not conf orm to the DCR the deviations are listed out in form of a report and intimated to the applicant/engaged Competent Professional for building plan design, vide an online ID in his account. b) Empowering Professionals : Empowering Competent Professionals as prescribed for building plan design will facilitate to streamline the procedure for obtaining approvals. The urban local body or urban local authority or by the Housing and Urban Development of the UT of J&K shall empanel such professionals based on their qualifications and track record. The empowered professionals can, also on behalf of developers/builders submit the documents required at the time of various clearances. This has been comprehensively defined in the Chapter 2. c) Creating a Cell in ULBs : There is a need for creating a specialized cell in ULBs and UDAs which is manned by qualified personnel conversant with the procedures and the interpretation o f development regulations. The c ell should be headed by a qualified Town Planner who should inter alia lead a team of Architects, Engineers, Environment Specialist and Legal Experts among others. The cell should hav e the dedicated provision for online submissions and conveying the online approvals as well. This will require robust software and hardware system capable of handling large digital files. d) Single Window System : All agencies involved in the process need to be integrated in a single electronic facility with proper coordination and monitoring of timelines. The 52 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 Municipal Corporation/Council /Committee needs to constitute teams comprising of experts from various agencies to be formed under the overall supervision of a Town Planner designated to assist developers /builders with complex projects and to constantly improve the sanction process by cutting dow n delays. e) Integration of agencies outside the ULBs for online clearances : Various agencies like AAI, NMA, SUAC, Fire Services, Department of Industries, Ministry of Defence , etc. grant NOC clearance to the building plans in certain specific cases. This ma y be streamlined for Ease of Doing Business by following 2 directions as given below :\u2014 i. Building permission for specific areas /sizes are to be examined by the external agencies. These areas should be plotted on GIS based colour -coded map which may be made a vailable in the public domain on the agency 's webs ite, with clearly identified co ordinates so that building falling only in these areas need to approach the concerned agencies for obtaining clearances. These maps may also be made available on the website o f the concerned municipal b odies. ii. The external agencies also need to develop online clearance/NOC application systems which should suitably be integrated with the online building approval systems of the municipal bodies. The two systems should be so compat ible that the building plans submitted to the local bodies may after scrutinizing with colour -coded zoning maps shall be e -transmitted to the external agencies. The agency concerned should give clearance within a period of maximum of 10 days with no requir ement of applicant to physically visit the offices of the agencies. The NOC may again be e -transmitted to the concerned local body on the building permission system so that the ULB shall use those for final approval. No. 42 -2] The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. 53 3.3 Development of an IT enabled team to op erate the Building Permission Online : a) The IT person shall be able to analyse and identify the issues regarding the building permit in the existing system as well as for the system of Single Window Clearance to be adopted in the future . b) The IT team shall enable a preview selection mode so that the applicants after submitting all the documents can preview it before final submission in the existing online system . c) The IT team shall also add the total ti me-frame for clearance at each step in the existing onlin e system dashboard . d) The IT person shall coordinate with various departments which issues NOCs and shall also identify the total time required in issuing it. e) Various issues in cross verifying the uploaded documents for e. g. uploading of digital s ignature, online payments, inspection etc. shall be listed in order to improve the existing online approval system as well as for shifting to the automated building approvals in the future . f) The physical submission of building permit documents shall be remo ved by introduction of Pre -DCR software to the applicants. g) The IT team shall enable online tracking system of NOCs if applicable through the existing online system for the applicants . h) The IT team shall provide a Pre -DCR formatted software to the consultant s (Architects/Engineers/Draftsman etc.) till the time automated building approval system is not introduced. i) The IT team shall issue an applicant no. through which if an applicant uploads the requisite documents thereafter after verification by the IT team can download the Occupancy Certificate. 3.4 Other Suggestions to enhance E ase of Doing Business : Some other suggestions, regarding Fast Track construction permits are \u2014 a) Citizens ' Charter : A Citizens ' charter lists out the timelines and upper limits of time for the delivery of citizen services of the organization. 54 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 The objective of issuing the charter is to improve the quality of public service in terms of timely delivery. Such charters shoul d be brought out by all municipalities to maintain high standards of accountability and transparency. The standards of service to be provided, the maximum number of days required for building approvals and the standards procedures should be listed out in t he citizens ' charter. Some states have gone a step further and introduced a C itizen Service Delivery Guarantee Act whereby the timelines prescribed by a citizen charter are made statutory and binding on officials. b) Capacity Building : Capacity building mea sures are to be adopted for such functionaries to identify Training Needs (TNA) and other technical requirement of duties that they are required to discharge. Fresh recruitments commensurate to the technical qualification /experience are to be made by the UT, if there is complete absence of the technical expertise needed for the said services. c) Empowered Committees : The Authorities may also consider constituting 'Empowered Committees ' or 'Peer Expert Groups ' for undertaking scrutiny and approval. This commi ttee can be manned as per the requirement and area of more than one municipality can be put under its jurisdiction. This has special significance for tall buildings. d) Simplification of Bye-laws : The B uilding Bye-laws have been simplified for easy comprehe nsion of lay person as well as professionals involved in developmental activities. The simplification process should also include the process of application, the filling up of forms and streamli ning the process of application.

Unless, the global surface temperature rise is restricted to no more than 2oC compared with pre- industrial levels, the IPCC has warned that the world will see irreversible catastrophic climate change . (b) India being a signatory to the UNFCCC, has pledged for efforts to assess the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of anthropogenic origin and removal by sinks. India 's per capita emissions are still considered low at 1.9 tonnes (2013), but its total emissions are next only to China and the US and is likely to overtake those of the EU by 2019. (c) While comparing the Indian cities for their emission scores, Delhi is on top as the biggest emitter at over 38. 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent overall emissions, followed by Greater Mumbai at 22.7 million tonnes and 134 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 Chennai at 22.1 million tonnes, Kolkata at 14.8 million tonnes, Bangalore at 19.8 million tonnes, Hyderabad at 13.7 million tonnes and Ahmedabad at 9 million tonnes were the other cities whose emissions for the year were calculated sector -wise. (d) As per the statistics of Transport Department (GNCTD), total number of vehicles in Delhi is more than the combined total vehicles in Mumbai , Chennai and Kolkata. Delhi has 85 private cars per 1000 population against the national average of 8 cars per 1000 population. In terms of Co2 emissions due to motor vehicles, Delhi emits about 12.4 million tonnes while the city of Bengaluru emits about 8.6 million tonnes . (e) Therefore, addressing the quantum of emissions from the \"Transport \" and \"Domestic \" sector emerges to be the high priority subjects under the overarching umbrella of \"Climate change mitigation \" as committed to the UNFCC. (f) Encouraging \"Electric Vehicles \" as a viable option for phased transportation in terms of short and long-distance trips with appropriate \"Charging Infrastructure \" is therefore, the pre-condition for this paradigm shift I phased migration to sustainable transportation . (g) For these changes are required in i nfrastructure provisions (at Regional and City level s) and in Development Control Regulations (in terms of provisions therein) to include the formulations of norms and standards for \"Charging Infrastructure \" in the said Master Plan Regulations and UT/State Building Regulations for adoption across the countr y suiting local conditions. 8.3 EV Charging Technology 8.3.1 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ( EVSE) : An EVSE is a wall mounted box that supplies electric energy for recharging of electric vehicle batteries. Also, EVSEs have a safety lock -out feature that does not allow current to flow from the device until the plug is physically inserted into the car. No. 42 -2] The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. 135 EVSEs can be customized with added features like \u2014 \u00b7 Authentication . \u00b7 Integrated payment gateways . \u00b7 Software for remote monitoring . As electric vehicle charging technology continues to advance, several standards and guidelines have become widely accepted across the industry. Chapter 8 gives a brief overview of charging infrastructure technology, standards, and terminology . 8.3.2 Different types of EVSE : (a) Charging speeds : Charging power, which determines the time required to charge a vehicle, can vary by orders of magnitude across charge points, as shown in Table 8.3. A small household outlet may charge as slowly as 1.2 K W, while the most advanced rapid charging stations can charge at up to 350 KW. Charging infrastructure is broadly broken into three categories based on speed: Level 1, Level 2, and direct current (DC) fast charging (sometimes referred to as Level 3). (Source: \"Emerging Best Practices for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure \", Oct., 2017) (b) Private Charging : Charging batteries of privately -owned cars through domestic charging points. Billing is mostly part of home domestic metering . (c) AC \"Slow \" Charging : The home private chargers are generally used with 230Vl15A single phase plug which can deliver a maximum of up to about 2.5KW of power. The EVSE supplies AC current to the vehicle's on -board charger which in turn converts the AC power to DC allowing the battery to be charged. (d) Public Charging : For charging outside the home premises, electric power needs to be billed and payment needs to be collected. The power drawn by these chargers may need to be managed from time to time. (e) DC \"Fast\" Charging : DC current is sent to the electric car's battery directly via the charge port. FC chargers (usually 50 KW or more) can supply 100 or more kilometres of range per hour of charging. The fast chargers would generally be used as a top -up, rather than fully 136 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 charging vehicles. These are important for cab companies and corporate users who have a fleet of electric cars. 8.4 Options for EV Charging : (a) There is an urgent need to offer flexible charging infrastructure for different vehicle segments to drive adoption of EVs. Charging infrastructure is the most crucial enabler in the entire EV value chain. The exploration of different charging models according to the local conditions shall enable faster deployment of electric vehicles in the country . (b) EV share in all vehicl es : It has been broadly projected that by the current rate of adoption of EVs , about 15% of all vehicles in the country would be EVs by the year-2020. Therefore, while assuming percentage composition of all proposed capacities in Public facilities of vehicle holding capacity, the Metropolitan and 'Tier I' cities will be assume d d to have a higher percentage share of EVs, say 20% for now. The charging infrastructure prescriptions in all urban development guidelines shall, therefore, be in consonance with the said percentage . (c) Power Load sanction to premises : While adding these Charging Infrastructures to the proposed set of building types of the Indian cities, enhanced Power Load shall have to be had for each such building type by the Power DISCOMs, commensurate to the total additional power requirement of simultaneous operation of all the prescribed charging points in the premise. With further advancement of charging technologies and the enhanced capacity of chargers to draw more power, it is advised that the load capacity assigned to each premise should be kept with a safety factor of 1.25 with a long -term vision of 30 years.

CHAPTER 10 RAINWATER HARVESTING This chapter gives the mandatory requirements of water conservation. The methods and techniques shall be adopted from NBC, 2016. 10.1 The Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system : The harvesting of rainwater simply involves the collection of water from surfaces on wh ich rain falls, and subsequently storing this water for use. The rainwater collected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into the underground aquifers. In scientific terms water harvesting (broadly) refers to collection and storage of rainwate r from the rooftops. This also restricts evaporation and seepage into building foundations. All buildings having a plot size of 100 sq.m. Or more, while submitting the building plans for sanction, shall mandatorily include the complete proposal of rainwate r harvesting. A rainwater harvesting system consis ts of\u2014 (a) Roof catchment ; (b) Gutters ; (c) Down pipes ; (d) Rainwater /Storm water drains ; No. 42 -2] The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. 165 (e) Filter Chamber ; (f) Storage Tanks /Pits/Sumps ; (g) Ground Water recharge structures like pit, trench, tube well or combination of above structure. Rainwater Harvesting is a way to capture the rain runoff, store that water above ground or charge the underground aquifers and use it later. This happens naturally in open rural areas. But in congested, over -paved metropolitan cities, ther e is a need to devise methods to capture the rainwater. The rainwater that is incident on the surface /rooftop is guided to bore wells or pits or new/old /abandoned wells through small dia meter pipes to recharge the underground water which can be used later whenever required. Rainwater can be harvested to the extent of 55,000 litres per 100 sq. m. area per Year from rooftops. 10.2 Rain water harvesting techniques: There are two main tech niques of rainwater harvestings \u2014 (a) Storage of rainwater on surface for future use. (b) Recharge to ground water. The technical aspects and options of Rainwater harvesting from which the city authorities can assess and choose to adopt (Refer Appendix for the technical aspects and options as suggested by Mo del Building Bye -Laws , 2016). 10.3 Harvesting provisions in various Building categories: All buildings in a city contribute to the rainwater runoff during the monsoon and hence such runoff can be harvested for water reuse /recharge. The indicative provisions of rainwater harvesting in various buildings types are: Table 10\u20141: Provisions for Rain water harvesting by building types Category Use Area of Plot (sq.m.)

CHAPTER 13 CLIMATE RESILIENT CONSTRUCTION -INTEGRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE WITH SANCTION Land, Air, Noise, Water, Energy, biological /socio - economic /solid /other waste management are the main facts considered in relation to Pre, during and Post. Building Construction for Sustainable Environment Management. Therefore, it is necessary for the building process to ensure compliance to various conditions laid down by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF and CC ). The building construction sector is a major contributor towards carbon footprints which affects climate change. India is committed towards mitigating the effects of climate change and moving towards internationally accepted norms for environmentally friendly building construction. Currently this objective of environmental safeguard is achieved through obtaining a specific environmental clearance (EC) for any construction project having a size of more than 20,000 sq. m . This is administered under notification of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. With rapid urbanisation and growth of Indian economy, it is anticipated that the construction activity will experience a proportionate growth. Government is also committed towards streamlining of clearances for buildings and real estate sector and empowering the urban local bodies with an objective of e ase of doing b usiness . 13.1 Environmental conditions for compliance during Building approvals : The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has now decided to integrate the environmental concerns into No. 42 -2] The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. 183 building plan approval process and empowering the concerned local body/development authority to approve and certify compliance of stipulated requirements. The new building construction proposals are classified in the following 3 categories :\u2014 (i) Conditions for Category 'A' Buildings: Built -up Area 5000 sq. m.-20000 sq. m. (ii) Conditions for Category 'B' Buildings: Built -up Area 20000 sq. m.-50000 sq. m. (iii) Conditions for Category 'C' Buildings: Built -up Area 50000 sq. m.-150000 sq. m. States are, therefore, advised to amend their building by -laws by incorporating the set of conditions for each category A, B and C as mentioned above either for the entire State /UT or clearly identified part thereof, where they would like to integrate the environmental clearance conditions with building permissions and empower the local auth ority to examine, stipulate and ensure compliance of conditions required to address environmental concerns the State /UT should submit such proposal/notification at draft stage as well as a copy of the final notification to the MoEF and CC. (a) For building plans with a total built-up area between 5,000 sqm . and 1, 50,000 sqm. and environment clearance will be required to be synchronized with the building regulations . (b) The concerned Urban local body, authorized to sanction building plans, shall ensure at the time of sanctioning a building plan that the environmental requirements stipulated in Table 16.1 (for above 5,000 sqm . and up to 20,000 sqm.), Table 12.2 (for above 20,000 sqm. and up to 50,000 sqm.) and Table 12.3 (for above 50,000 sqm. and up to 1,50,000 sqm.), as the case may be, are complied with. 184 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3.

These are constructed 1 to 2m, wide and to 3m. deep which are back filled with boulders, gravels, coarse sand. (b) Trenches .\u2014These are constructed when the permeable stream is available at shallow depth. Trench may be 0.5 to 1m. wide, 1 to 1.5m deep and 10 to 20m long depending up availabil ity of water. These are back filled with filler materials. (c) Dug wells .\u2014Existing dug wells may be utilized as recharge structure and water should pass through filter media before putting into dug well. (d) Hand pumps .\u2014The existing hand pumps may be used for recharging the shallow/deep aquifers, if the availability of water is limited. Water should pass through filter media before diverting it into hand pumps. (e) Recharge wells .\u2014Recharge wells of 100 to 300 mm. dia meter are generally constructed for recharging the de eper aquifers and water is passed through filter media to avoid choking of recharge wells. (f) Recharge Shafts .\u2014For recharging the shallow aquifer which are located below clayey surface, recharge shafts of 0.5 to 3 m. diameter and 10 to 15 m. deep are construc ted and back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse sand. (g) Lateral shafts with bore -wells .\u2014For recharging the upper as well as deeper aquifers lateral shafts of 1.5 to 2 m. wide & 10 to 30 m. long depending upon availability of water with one or two bore wells are constructed. The lateral shafts are back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse sand. (h) Spreading techniques .\u2014When permeable strata start from top then this techniqu e is used.

Although, Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) occur in nature and thus have always been present on earth (Sun is the biggest source of natural EMR), nevertheless their occurrence has become more pronounced due to rapid advances of wireless technology in the commu nication sector. The twentieth century witnessed, steady rise of environmental exposure to man -made sources of EMF due to increasing electricity demand, ever -advancing wireless technologies and changes in work practices and social behaviour. The unpreceden ted growth in communication industry in recent years has also caused an exponential rise in electromagnetic radiations in the envelopes surrounding all living habitats. Human beings are thus exposed to a complex mix of electric and magnetic fields at many different frequencies, at home and at work. EMF (Electro Magnetic fiel ds) can be broadly divided into \u2014 1. Low-frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The common sources of which include power lines, household electrical appliances, and 2. High frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The main sources of which are radar, radio and television broadcasting, mobile telephones and their base stations, induction heaters and anti -theft devices etc . 230 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 Given below is the chart of Electromagnetic spectrum which highlights various ranges of frequencies and the equipment which work in these ranges of frequencies: \u2014 Figure G-1 Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt precautions for living beings from any effects of electromagnetic radiations at our work places as well as at our living spaces. Electromagnet ic Radiations : Effects o f Exposure : The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those on humans, depend upon the frequency as well as the penetrating power of the radiation. Initially, it was believed that low frequency fields were too weak to cause heating to a significant level and thus do not have any biological effect. There have been a number of epidemiological studies for a relationship between cell phone us e and consequent health threats that have been largely inconclusive. Thus, it can be concluded that their effect is not very prominent although significant. However, there are sufficient evidences to suggest the existence of No. 42 -2] The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. 231 complex biological effects of w eaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields, and modulated RF and microwave fields. World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as a possible group 2b carcinogen (possible weaker threats ). In case of low -frequency radiations (radio waves to visible light) therefore, depending upon the power of the radiation heating effects are caused due to absorption of radiation by the living cells. These thermal effects increase with the frequency of radi ation as penetration of radiation into the organism increases (for example microwaves penetrate more than infrared rays ). At higher frequencies (visible and beyond) however, the individual photons of the radiation carry enough energy individually and thus directly or indirectly can damage biological molecules. All frequencies of UV radiation have therefore been classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. In this context it is a significant fact that Ultraviolet radiation from sun exp osure is the primary cause of skin cancer. Thus, at such frequencies electromagnetic radiations cause much more damage to biological systems than simple heating. This is most obvious for the \"extreme \" Ultraviolet, X -ray and Gamma radiations, which are refe rred to as ionizing radiations due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials which include living tissues as well. Since such radiation can produce severe damage to life at powers that produce very little he ating, it is considered much more dangerous than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. Health risks from Electromagnetic radiations can be numerous depending upon the power and frequency of radiations . From the perspective of prevention of any health e ffects of Electro Magnetic Radiations there is a need of suitable precautions, since it is not possible to keep away from them owing to the advent of wireless communication technology which is based upon electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies besides many other applications like microwave, remote controlled toys, cordless phones, TV remotes, etc. 232 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 Guidelines for Buildings and Built forms mitigating effects of EMR : While planning a building or a residential complex /township, it is most desirable to list all probable equipment /appliance emitting Electromagnetic Radiations in order of ascending/descending intensities. These should also be categorized as per indoor and outdoor emissions. Their placement in the built space and surroundi ngs can then be decided based on certain premises . The most fundamental principal in this regard is that the effect of Electromagnetic Radiation decreases with increase in distance from radiation emitting source. It is thus advisable \u2014 \u00b7 To keep a safe distance from working electric and electronic equipment . \u00b7 Minimize the use of all equipment working on wireless technology like cordless phones, Wi -Fi, Bluetooth and the cell phones . \u00b7 Disconnect electric and electronic equipment from the power supply when not in use, especially in areas of prolonged occupancy . Further, the list of equipment/appliances generally used in and around working/living space is placed below for appreciation of EMR radiation: \u2014 1. RF Sources i.e. the transmitting towers suc h as AM/FM radio towers, TV towers, cell phone towers transmitting EMR continuously. 2. Cell phone which is ON but not in use also radiates and Wi Fi (Wireless Internet ). 3. Cordless phone . 4. Wi-max. 5. Other wireless devices . 6. CFL (Compact Florescent Light ) bulbs . 7. Neighbouring EMR sources that are located next to shared walls . 8. Computers and laptops . 9. Air conditioning systems . 10. Refrigerators . 11. Electrical heating systems /Microwave Ovens . 12. Power generators and voltage converters . 13. Stereo and home entertainment systems . 14. Fans . No. 42 -2] The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. 233 This list is only indicative and not exhaustive and there can be additions to it. From the view point of effective communication, providing of mobile towers in a township /office complex is an essential requirement and thus should be carefully planned. The mobile tower generates and transmits high frequency radiations; so more care is needed for their placement. It should be ensured that the building identified to mount the tower should be the tallest in the vicinity and should not have adjoining buildings o n which proposed or existing habitable floors are within close -range . OR Mobile Tower should be mounted on the highest sanctioned building in an area. In regular practice that many cellular operators mount their antenna on a single tower along with other o perators which increase the effects of EMR manifolds and should thus be avoided as far as possible. Else height . of the tower should be increased. Besides, Substation Equipment like Transformer, DG set etc. are also to be provided for fulfilling the bulk p ower requirement of the building and should be suitably placed for electrical safety as well as for mitigating effects of EMR. However, as these are low frequency devices, their placement is too decided more from electrical safety point of view than EMR. In addition, various light. sources inside the living/working spaces, UPS, servers, various other equipment running on Wi -Fi may also emit EMR. Hence their placement inside the building also needs careful consideration. Thus, in a built environment of consi derable human occupancy, following broad guidelines should be adopted for placement of utility equipment /appliances serving the building as a whole :\u2014 Equipment external to the building: Mobile Towers 234 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 Figure G-2 Location of communication towers is governed by radio frequency system adopted and as far as possible cellular operator should try to avoid residential areas. However, where it is not possible to avoid these, they should request for permission from the appropriate authority for installation on roof top of the tallest existing buildings \u2014 i. First preference should however, be given to the location of tower in the commercial areas or other public areas. ii. Where it is not possible to avoid the location of this tower in residential, area possibility should be explored to locate them in green belts within residential sectors or open spaces/community buildings in the sectors . Where it is not possible to find such suitable space mentioned at Sr. No. (ii) above, tower should be permitted on the roof top of residential buildings subject to the condition that a structural safety certificate from a certified Structural Engineer has been obtained. Such towers should not be permitted on occupied buildin gs, however if inevitable, a Steel /Metal frame of 6 m. height over the roof level of the last habitable floor of the building should be provided to accommodate the tower and its associated units. Structural stability of the said building should be calculat ed with the overall loading of such metal steel frames mounted atop and \"Structural stability certificate \" should be submitted by a registered structural engineer with the application for the permission of building (pre-design) or installation (post -design ). Transformers .\u2014In addition to the fenced ionized area around a transformer, neighbourhood level congregation activity areas should not be planned/permitted within 3 m of the fence. Diesel Generators .\u2014The location of the Generator within the Plot premises should not be adjacent to any habitable /community / recreational activity within a radius of 3 m. Indoor equipment/Appliances: Electrical Switchboards .\u2014Unless otherwise amended by Barrier - free access regulations to such fixtures, they should be mounted as per existing stipulations laid down in CPWD General Specifications for Electrical Works -Part I Internal 2013. No. 42 -2] The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. 235 Wireless Routers .\u2014 Within the housing unit, the vertical mounting height of the router should be not les s than 4 feet and should be kept in the Drawing /Dining zone and not within the zones of longer period of occupancy e.g. Bedrooms. In non -residential units i.e. office spaces these routers should be kept as much away as possible and should be switched off w hen not in use. Figure G-3 Server Room .\u2014Occupied Work -stations should be at least 5 m away from the server room or associated equipment. If people are sitting in the same room, they must wear protective gear and should not have prolonged exposure. Computer .\u2014Should be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space, it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. UPS.\u2014Should also be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. Mobile Phone .\u2014It usually remains with the user all the time. The only time it is kept away is when it is being charged. Thus mobile should be charged from a remotely located power point. It is thus preferable to provide a charging station in almost every working/living sp ace at a location, as far as permissible from living space considerations. Light sources .\u2014Usually, sun as a source of natural light is the biggest source of electromagnetic radiations. However, the atmosphere surrounding us provides a natural shield from electromagnetic radiations. In this context, the light sources used inside a living/working space should be given careful consideration 236 The J&K Official Gazette, 14th Jan ., 2022/24th Pausa ., 194 3. [No. 42 -2 from the point of view of Electromagnetic Radiations. Man y luminaries available presently, like Fluorescent tubes, compa ct fluorescent lamps, LED lights etc. are used in working /living spaces. So, their use should not only be determined from the point of view of energy conservation but also from the point of view of Electromagnetic Radiations. For this purpose, recommendati ons of the manufacturers should serve as proper guidelines \u2014 Table G\u20141: below summarizes appropriate placement of equipment 's/appliances in the built environment :\u2014 Sr. No Equipment Minimum safe distance 1.

CHAPTER 3 STREAMLINIING OF BUILDING PLAN APPROVALS 3.1 Clearances at Master Plan level : Individual construction proposals should not generally require separate clearances from various authorities each time. Such clearances should be integrated into the DCR of the Master/Development Plan of the concerned city. The areas unaffected by any of th e restrictions should be clearly marked out and mapped on a GIS platform. Area zones of differential control regulations (within the city) by any of these agencies may also be mapped accordingly. This will result in a composite map of the city with various control regulations as per the various agencies clearly marked on the map. Thus, the sites which are located outside these restricted/regulated areas would not require clearance from the respective authorities, thereby reducing the clearance 50 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 process signi ficantly. Following are the clearances which should be integrated into the city Master Plan :\u2014 Table 3\u20141: Minimum Clearances from various agencies proposed to be integrated in Master Plans S. No. Name of Agency Type of Clearance Area of Influence 1 National Monuments Authority through Local BPIA Ancient Monument approval As prescribed in the AMASAR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010 for protection of monuments. And J&K Archaeology /Heritage Preservation Act 2 Ministry of Environment , Forest and Climate Change Environment Clearance (EC) As prescribed in the statutory provisions for EIA and clearance based on the size of the project in accordance with Environment P rotection Act, 1986 3 Central Ground Water Authority through Local BPIA Bore -well Registration Certificate As per Guidelines/criteria for evaluation of proposals /requests for Ground Water Abstraction, 2012 4 Ministry of Civil Aviation AAI Height . NOC Critical and non-critical area as identified by AAI 5 Ministry of Defen ce Defence Clearance Areas in and around Defence Establishments as identified by MoD. 6 Ministry of Railways Area Clearance Buffer zones as prescribed by Railways along the Rail tracks/ depots/yards etc. 3.2 Options for reducing the timelines for approvals : The above suggested steps are only indicative, however, there is scope for streamlining the procedures for clearances to be obtained from various departments in the least possible number No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 51 of procedures and number of days. Some of the options which can reduce the time taken for various procedures are: \u2014 a) Online sanctions : ULBs/Development Authorities have introduced online sanction for issuing building plan and completion certificate. The process involves use of software tools for sc rutiny of building plans. All the documents are required to be submitted electronically using a portal. In case the building plans do not conf orm to the DCR the deviations are listed out in form of a report and intimated to the applicant/engaged Competent Professional for building plan design, vide an online ID in his account. b) Empowering Professionals : Empowering Competent Professionals as prescribed for building plan design will facilitate to streamline the procedure for obtaining approvals. The urban local body or urban local authority or by the Housing and Urban Development of the UT of J&K shall empanel such professionals based on their qualifications and track record. The empowered professionals can, also on behalf of developers/builders submit the documents required at the time of various clearances. This has been comprehensively defined in the Chapter 2. c) Creating a Cell in ULBs : There is a need for creating a specialized cell in ULBs and UDAs which is manned by qualified personnel conversant with the procedures and the interpretation o f development regulations. The c ell should be headed by a qualified Town Planner who should inter alia lead a team of Architects, Engineers, Environment Specialist and Legal Experts among others. The cell should hav e the dedicated provision for online submissions and conveying the online approvals as well. This will require robust software and hardware system capable of handling large digital files. d) Single Window System : All agencies involved in the process need to be integrated in a single electronic facility with proper coordination and monitoring of timelines. The 52 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 Municipal Corporation/Council /Committee needs to constitute teams comprising of experts from various agencies to be formed under the overall supervision of a Town Planner designated to assist developers /builders with complex projects and to constantly improve the sanction process by cutting dow n delays. e) Integration of agencies outside the ULBs for online clearances : Various agencies like AAI, NMA, SUAC, Fire Services, Department of Industries, Ministry of Defence , etc. grant NOC clearance to the building plans in certain specific cases. This ma y be streamlined for Ease of Doing Business by following 2 directions as given below :\u2014 i. Building permission for specific areas /sizes are to be examined by the external agencies. These areas should be plotted on GIS based colour -coded map which may be made a vailable in the public domain on the agency 's webs ite, with clearly identified co ordinates so that building falling only in these areas need to approach the concerned agencies for obtaining clearances. These maps may also be made available on the website o f the concerned municipal b odies. ii. The external agencies also need to develop online clearance/NOC application systems which should suitably be integrated with the online building approval systems of the municipal bodies. The two systems should be so compat ible that the building plans submitted to the local bodies may after scrutinizing with colour -coded zoning maps shall be e -transmitted to the external agencies. The agency concerned should give clearance within a period of maximum of 10 days with no requir ement of applicant to physically visit the offices of the agencies. The NOC may again be e -transmitted to the concerned local body on the building permission system so that the ULB shall use those for final approval. No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 53 3.3 Development of an IT enabled team to op erate the Building Permission Online : a) The IT person shall be able to analyse and identify the issues regarding the building permit in the existing system as well as for the system of Single Window Clearance to be adopted in the future . b) The IT team shall enable a preview selection mode so that the applicants after submitting all the documents can preview it before final submission in the existing online system . c) The IT team shall also add the total ti me-frame for clearance at each step in the existing onlin e system dashboard . d) The IT person shall coordinate with various departments which issues NOCs and shall also identify the total time required in issuing it. e) Various issues in cross verifying the uploaded documents for e. g. uploading of digital s ignature, online payments, inspection etc. shall be listed in order to improve the existing online approval system as well as for shifting to the automated building approvals in the future . f) The physical submission of building permit documents shall be remo ved by introduction of Pre -DCR software to the applicants. g) The IT team shall enable online tracking system of NOCs if applicable through the existing online system for the applicants . h) The IT team shall provide a Pre -DCR formatted software to the consultant s (Architects/Engineers/Draftsman etc.) till the time automated building approval system is not introduced. i) The IT team shall issue an applicant no. through which if an applicant uploads the requisite documents thereafter after verification by the IT team can download the Occupancy Certificate. 3.4 Other Suggestions to enhance E ase of Doing Business : Some other suggestions, regarding Fast Track construction permits are \u2014 a) Citizens ' Charter : A Citizens ' charter lists out the timelines and upper limits of time for the delivery of citizen services of the organization. 54 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 The objective of issuing the charter is to improve the quality of public service in terms of timely delivery. Such charters shoul d be brought out by all municipalities to maintain high standards of accountability and transparency. The standards of service to be provided, the maximum number of days required for building approvals and the standards procedures should be listed out in t he citizens ' charter. Some states have gone a step further and introduced a C itizen Service Delivery Guarantee Act whereby the timelines prescribed by a citizen charter are made statutory and binding on officials. b) Capacity Building : Capacity building mea sures are to be adopted for such functionaries to identify Training Needs (TNA) and other technical requirement of duties that they are required to discharge. Fresh recruitments commensurate to the technical qualification /experience are to be made by the UT, if there is complete absence of the technical expertise needed for the said services. c) Empowered Committees : The Authorities may also consider constituting 'Empowered Committees ' or 'Peer Expert Groups ' for undertaking scrutiny and approval. This commi ttee can be manned as per the requirement and area of more than one municipality can be put under its jurisdiction. This has special significance for tall buildings. d) Simplification of Bye-laws : The B uilding Bye-laws have been simplified for easy comprehe nsion of lay person as well as professionals involved in developmental activities. The simplification process should also include the process of application, the filling up of forms and streamli ning the process of application.

(c) While comparing the Indian cities for their emission scores, Delhi is on top as the biggest emitter at over 38. 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent overall emissions, followed by Greater Mumbai at 22.7 million tonnes and 134 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 Chennai at 22.1 million tonnes, Kolkata at 14.8 million tonnes, Bangalore at 19.8 million tonnes, Hyderabad at 13.7 million tonnes and Ahmedabad at 9 million tonnes were the other cities whose emissions for the year were calculated sector -wise. (d) As per the statistics of Transport Department (GNCTD), total number of vehicles in Delhi is more than the combined total vehicles in Mumbai , Chennai and Kolkata. Delhi has 85 private cars per 1000 population against the national average of 8 cars per 1000 population. In terms of Co2 emissions due to motor vehicles, Delhi emits about 12.4 million tonnes while the city of Bengaluru emits about 8.6 million tonnes . (e) Therefore, addressing the quantum of emissions from the \"Transport \" and \"Domestic \" sector emerges to be the high priority subjects under the overarching umbrella of \"Climate change mitigation \" as committed to the UNFCC. (f) Encouraging \"Electric Vehicles \" as a viable option for phased transportation in terms of short and long-distance trips with appropriate \"Charging Infrastructure \" is therefore, the pre-condition for this paradigm shift I phased migration to sustainable transportation . (g) For these changes are required in i nfrastructure provisions (at Regional and City level s) and in Development Control Regulations (in terms of provisions therein) to include the formulations of norms and standards for \"Charging Infrastructure \" in the said Master Plan Regulations and UT/State Building Regulations for adoption across the countr y suiting local conditions. 8.3 EV Charging Technology 8.3.1 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ( EVSE) : An EVSE is a wall mounted box that supplies electric energy for recharging of electric vehicle batteries. Also, EVSEs have a safety lock -out feature that does not allow current to flow from the device until the plug is physically inserted into the car. No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 135 EVSEs can be customized with added features like \u2014 \u00b7 Authentication . \u00b7 Integrated payment gateways . \u00b7 Software for remote monitoring . As electric vehicle charging technology continues to advance, several standards and guidelines have become widely accepted across the industry. Chapter 8 gives a brief overview of charging infrastructure technology, standards, and terminology . 8.3.2 Different types of EVSE : (a) Charging speeds : Charging power, which determines the time required to charge a vehicle, can vary by orders of magnitude across charge points, as shown in Table 8.3. A small household outlet may charge as slowly as 1.2 K W, while the most advanced rapid charging stations can charge at up to 350 KW. Charging infrastructure is broadly broken into three categories based on speed: Level 1, Level 2, and direct current (DC) fast charging (sometimes referred to as Level 3). (Source: \"Emerging Best Practices for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure \", Oct., 2017) (b) Private Charging : Charging batteries of privately -owned cars through domestic charging points. Billing is mostly part of home domestic metering . (c) AC \"Slow \" Charging : The home private chargers are generally used with 230Vl15A single phase plug which can deliver a maximum of up to about 2.5KW of power. The EVSE supplies AC current to the vehicle's on -board charger which in turn converts the AC power to DC allowing the battery to be charged. (d) Public Charging : For charging outside the home premises, electric power needs to be billed and payment needs to be collected. The power drawn by these chargers may need to be managed from time to time. (e) DC \"Fast\" Charging : DC current is sent to the electric car's battery directly via the charge port. FC chargers (usually 50 KW or more) can supply 100 or more kilometres of range per hour of charging. The fast chargers would generally be used as a top -up, rather than fully 136 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 charging vehicles. These are important for cab companies and corporate users who have a fleet of electric cars. 8.4 Options for EV Charging : (a) There is an urgent need to offer flexible charging infrastructure for different vehicle segments to drive adoption of EVs. Charging infrastructure is the most crucial enabler in the entire EV value chain. The exploration of different charging models according to the local conditions shall enable faster deployment of electric vehicles in the country . (b) EV share in all vehicl es : It has been broadly projected that by the current rate of adoption of EVs , about 15% of all vehicles in the country would be EVs by the year-2020. Therefore, while assuming percentage composition of all proposed capacities in Public facilities of vehicle holding capacity, the Metropolitan and 'Tier I' cities will be assume d d to have a higher percentage share of EVs, say 20% for now. The charging infrastructure prescriptions in all urban development guidelines shall, therefore, be in consonance with the said percentage . (c) Power Load sanction to premises : While adding these Charging Infrastructures to the proposed set of building types of the Indian cities, enhanced Power Load shall have to be had for each such building type by the Power DISCOMs, commensurate to the total additional power requirement of simultaneous operation of all the prescribed charging points in the premise. With further advancement of charging technologies and the enhanced capacity of chargers to draw more power, it is advised that the load capacity assigned to each premise should be kept with a safety factor of 1.25 with a long -term vision of 30 years.

CHAPTER 10 RAINWATER HARVESTING This chapter gives the mandatory requirements of water conservation. The methods and techniques shall be adopted from NBC, 2016. 10.1 The Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system : The harvesting of rainwater simply involves the collection of water from surfaces on wh ich rain falls, and subsequently storing this water for use. The rainwater collected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into the underground aquifers. In scientific terms water harvesting (broadly) refers to collection and storage of rainwate r from the rooftops. This also restricts evaporation and seepage into building foundations. All buildings having a plot size of 100 sq.m. Or more, while submitting the building plans for sanction, shall mandatorily include the complete proposal of rainwate r harvesting. A rainwater harvesting system consis ts of\u2014 (a) Roof catchment ; (b) Gutters ; (c) Down pipes ; (d) Rainwater /Storm water drains ; No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 165 (e) Filter Chamber ; (f) Storage Tanks /Pits/Sumps ; (g) Ground Water recharge structures like pit, trench, tube well or combination of above structure. Rainwater Harvesting is a way to capture the rain runoff, store that water above ground or charge the underground aquifers and use it later. This happens naturally in open rural areas. But in congested, over -paved metropolitan cities, ther e is a need to devise methods to capture the rainwater. The rainwater that is incident on the surface /rooftop is guided to bore wells or pits or new/old /abandoned wells through small dia meter pipes to recharge the underground water which can be used later whenever required. Rainwater can be harvested to the extent of 55,000 litres per 100 sq. m. area per Year from rooftops. 10.2 Rain water harvesting techniques: There are two main tech niques of rainwater harvestings \u2014 (a) Storage of rainwater on surface for future use. (b) Recharge to ground water. The technical aspects and options of Rainwater harvesting from which the city authorities can assess and choose to adopt (Refer Appendix for the technical aspects and options as suggested by Mo del Building Bye -Laws , 2016). 10.3 Harvesting provisions in various Building categories: All buildings in a city contribute to the rainwater runoff during the monsoon and hence such runoff can be harvested for water reuse /recharge. The indicative provisions of rainwater harvesting in various buildings types are: Table 10\u20141: Provisions for Rain water harvesting by building types Category Use Area of Plot (sq.m.)

Building Construction for Sustainable Environment Management. Therefore, it is necessary for the building process to ensure compliance to various conditions laid down by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF and CC ). The building construction sector is a major contributor towards carbon footprints which affects climate change. India is committed towards mitigating the effects of climate change and moving towards internationally accepted norms for environmentally friendly building construction. Currently this objective of environmental safeguard is achieved through obtaining a specific environmental clearance (EC) for any construction project having a size of more than 20,000 sq. m . This is administered under notification of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. With rapid urbanisation and growth of Indian economy, it is anticipated that the construction activity will experience a proportionate growth. Government is also committed towards streamlining of clearances for buildings and real estate sector and empowering the urban local bodies with an objective of e ase of doing b usiness . 13.1 Environmental conditions for compliance during Building approvals : The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has now decided to integrate the environmental concerns into No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 183 building plan approval process and empowering the concerned local body/development authority to approve and certify compliance of stipulated requirements.

Although, Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) occur in nature and thus have always been present on earth (Sun is the biggest source of natural EMR), nevertheless their occurrence has become more pronounced due to rapid advances of wireless technology in the commu nication sector. The twentieth century witnessed, steady rise of environmental exposure to man -made sources of EMF due to increasing electricity demand, ever -advancing wireless technologies and changes in work practices and social behaviour. The unpreceden ted growth in communication industry in recent years has also caused an exponential rise in electromagnetic radiations in the envelopes surrounding all living habitats. Human beings are thus exposed to a complex mix of electric and magnetic fields at many different frequencies, at home and at work. EMF (Electro Magnetic fiel ds) can be broadly divided into \u2014 1. Low-frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The common sources of which include power lines, household electrical appliances, and 2. High frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The main sources of which are radar, radio and television broadcasting, mobile telephones and their base stations, induction heaters and anti -theft devices etc . 230 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 Given below is the chart of Electromagnetic spectrum which highlights various ranges of frequencies and the equipment which work in these ranges of frequencies: \u2014 Figure G-1 Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt precautions for living beings from any effects of electromagnetic radiations at our work places as well as at our living spaces. Electromagnet ic Radiations : Effects o f Exposure : The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those on humans, depend upon the frequency as well as the penetrating power of the radiation. Initially, it was believed that low frequency fields were too weak to cause heating to a significant level and thus do not have any biological effect. There have been a number of epidemiological studies for a relationship between cell phone us e and consequent health threats that have been largely inconclusive. Thus, it can be concluded that their effect is not very prominent although significant. However, there are sufficient evidences to suggest the existence of No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 231 complex biological effects of w eaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields, and modulated RF and microwave fields. World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as a possible group 2b carcinogen (possible weaker threats ). In case of low -frequency radiations (radio waves to visible light) therefore, depending upon the power of the radiation heating effects are caused due to absorption of radiation by the living cells. These thermal effects increase with the frequency of radi ation as penetration of radiation into the organism increases (for example microwaves penetrate more than infrared rays ). At higher frequencies (visible and beyond) however, the individual photons of the radiation carry enough energy individually and thus directly or indirectly can damage biological molecules. All frequencies of UV radiation have therefore been classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. In this context it is a significant fact that Ultraviolet radiation from sun exp osure is the primary cause of skin cancer. Thus, at such frequencies electromagnetic radiations cause much more damage to biological systems than simple heating. This is most obvious for the \"extreme \" Ultraviolet, X -ray and Gamma radiations, which are refe rred to as ionizing radiations due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials which include living tissues as well. Since such radiation can produce severe damage to life at powers that produce very little he ating, it is considered much more dangerous than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. Health risks from Electromagnetic radiations can be numerous depending upon the power and frequency of radiations . From the perspective of prevention of any health e ffects of Electro Magnetic Radiations there is a need of suitable precautions, since it is not possible to keep away from them owing to the advent of wireless communication technology which is based upon electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies besides many other applications like microwave, remote controlled toys, cordless phones, TV remotes, etc. 232 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 Guidelines for Buildings and Built forms mitigating effects of EMR : While planning a building or a residential complex /township, it is most desirable to list all probable equipment /appliance emitting Electromagnetic Radiations in order of ascending/descending intensities. These should also be categorized as per indoor and outdoor emissions. Their placement in the built space and surroundi ngs can then be decided based on certain premises . The most fundamental principal in this regard is that the effect of Electromagnetic Radiation decreases with increase in distance from radiation emitting source. It is thus advisable \u2014 \u00b7 To keep a safe distance from working electric and electronic equipment . \u00b7 Minimize the use of all equipment working on wireless technology like cordless phones, Wi -Fi, Bluetooth and the cell phones . \u00b7 Disconnect electric and electronic equipment from the power supply when not in use, especially in areas of prolonged occupancy . Further, the list of equipment/appliances generally used in and around working/living space is placed below for appreciation of EMR radiation: \u2014 1. RF Sources i.e. the transmitting towers suc h as AM/FM radio towers, TV towers, cell phone towers transmitting EMR continuously. 2. Cell phone which is ON but not in use also radiates and Wi Fi (Wireless Internet ). 3. Cordless phone . 4. Wi-max. 5. Other wireless devices . 6. CFL (Compact Florescent Light ) bulbs . 7. Neighbouring EMR sources that are located next to shared walls . 8. Computers and laptops . 9. Air conditioning systems . 10. Refrigerators . 11. Electrical heating systems /Microwave Ovens . 12. Power generators and voltage converters . 13. Stereo and home entertainment systems . 14. Fans . No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 233 This list is only indicative and not exhaustive and there can be additions to it. From the view point of effective communication, providing of mobile towers in a township /office complex is an essential requirement and thus should be carefully planned. The mobile tower generates and transmits high frequency radiations; so more care is needed for their placement. It should be ensured that the building identified to mount the tower should be the tallest in the vicinity and should not have adjoining buildings o n which proposed or existing habitable floors are within close -range . OR Mobile Tower should be mounted on the highest sanctioned building in an area. In regular practice that many cellular operators mount their antenna on a single tower along with other o perators which increase the effects of EMR manifolds and should thus be avoided as far as possible. Else height . of the tower should be increased. Besides, Substation Equipment like Transformer, DG set etc. are also to be provided for fulfilling the bulk p ower requirement of the building and should be suitably placed for electrical safety as well as for mitigating effects of EMR. However, as these are low frequency devices, their placement is too decided more from electrical safety point of view than EMR. In addition, various light. sources inside the living/working spaces, UPS, servers, various other equipment running on Wi -Fi may also emit EMR. Hence their placement inside the building also needs careful consideration. Thus, in a built environment of consi derable human occupancy, following broad guidelines should be adopted for placement of utility equipment /appliances serving the building as a whole :\u2014 Equipment external to the building: Mobile Towers 234 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -7 Figure G-2 Location of communication towers is governed by radio frequency system adopted and as far as possible cellular operator should try to avoid residential areas. However, where it is not possible to avoid these, they should request for permission from the appropriate authority for installation on roof top of the tallest existing buildings \u2014 i. First preference should however, be given to the location of tower in the commercial areas or other public areas. ii. Where it is not possible to avoid the location of this tower in residential, area possibility should be explored to locate them in green belts within residential sectors or open spaces/community buildings in the sectors . Where it is not possible to find such suitable space mentioned at Sr. No. (ii) above, tower should be permitted on the roof top of residential buildings subject to the condition that a structural safety certificate from a certified Structural Engineer has been obtained. Such towers should not be permitted on occupied buildin gs, however if inevitable, a Steel /Metal frame of 6 m. height over the roof level of the last habitable floor of the building should be provided to accommodate the tower and its associated units. Structural stability of the said building should be calculat ed with the overall loading of such metal steel frames mounted atop and \"Structural stability certificate \" should be submitted by a registered structural engineer with the application for the permission of building (pre-design) or installation (post -design ). Transformers .\u2014In addition to the fenced ionized area around a transformer, neighbourhood level congregation activity areas should not be planned/permitted within 3 m of the fence. Diesel Generators .\u2014The location of the Generator within the Plot premises should not be adjacent to any habitable /community / recreational activity within a radius of 3 m. Indoor equipment/Appliances: Electrical Switchboards .\u2014Unless otherwise amended by Barrier - free access regulations to such fixtures, they should be mounted as per existing stipulations laid down in CPWD General Specifications for Electrical Works -Part I Internal 2013. No. 36 -7] The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3. 235 Wireless Routers .\u2014 Within the housing unit, the vertical mounting height of the router should be not les s than 4 feet and should be kept in the Drawing /Dining zone and not within the zones of longer period of occupancy e.g. Bedrooms. In non -residential units i.e. office spaces these routers should be kept as much away as possible and should be switched off w hen not in use. Figure G-3 Server Room .\u2014Occupied Work -stations should be at least 5 m away from the server room or associated equipment. If people are sitting in the same room, they must wear protective gear and should not have prolonged exposure. Computer .\u2014Should be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space, it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. UPS.\u2014Should also be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. Mobile Phone .\u2014It usually remains with the user all the time. The only time it is kept away is when it is being charged. Thus mobile should be charged from a remotely located power point. It is thus preferable to provide a charging station in almost every working/living sp ace at a location, as far as permissible from living space considerations. Light sources .\u2014Usually, sun as a source of natural light is the biggest source of electromagnetic radiations. However, the atmosphere surrounding us provides a natural shield from electromagnetic radiations. In this context, the light sources used inside a living/working space should be given careful consideration 236 The J&K Official Gazette, 7th Dec., 2021/16th Agra ., 194 3.

CHAPTER 3 STREAMLINIING OF BUILDING PLAN APPROVALS 3.1 Clearances at Master Plan level : Individual construction proposals should not generally require separate clearances from various authorities each time. Such clearances should be integrated into the DCR of the Master/Development Plan of the concerned city. The areas unaffected by any of th e restrictions should be clearly marked out and mapped on a GIS platform. Area zones of differential control regulations (within the city) by any of these agencies may also be mapped accordingly. This will result in a composite map of the city with various control regulations as per the various agencies clearly marked on the map. Thus, the sites which are located outside these restricted/regulated areas would not require clearance from the respective authorities, thereby reducing the clearance 50 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 process signi ficantly. Following are the clearances which should be integrated into the city Master Plan :\u2014 Table 3\u20141: Minimum Clearances from various agencies proposed to be integrated in Master Plans S.

Some of the options which can reduce the time taken for various procedures are: \u2014 a) Online sanctions : ULBs/Development Authorities have introduced online sanction for issuing building plan and completion certificate. The process involves use of software tools for scrutiny of building plans. All the documents are required to be submitted electronically using a portal. In case the building plans do not conf orm to the DCR the deviations are listed out in form of a report and intimated to the applicant/engaged Competent Professional for building plan design, vide an online ID in his account. b) Empowering Professionals : Empowering Competent Professionals as prescribed for building plan design will facilitate to streamline the procedure for obtaining approvals. The urban local body or urban local authority or by the Housing and Urban Development of the UT of J&K shall empanel such professionals based on their qualifications and track record. The empowered professionals can, also on behalf of developers/builders submit the documents required at the time of various clearances. This has been comprehensively defined in the Chapter 2. c) Creating a Cell in ULBs : There is a need for creating a specialized cell in ULBs and UDAs which is manned by qualified personnel conversant with the procedures and the interpretation o f development regulations. The c ell should be headed by a qual ified Town Planner who should inter alia lead a team of Architects, Engineers, Environment Specialist and Legal Experts among others. The cell should have the dedicated provision for online submissions and conveying the online approvals as well. This will require robust software and hardware system capable of handling large digital files. d) Single Window System : All agencies involved in the process need to be integrated in a single electronic facility with proper coordination and monitoring of timelines. Th e 52 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 Municipal Corporation/Council /Committee needs to constitute teams comprising of experts from various agencies to be formed under the overall supervision of a Town Planner designated to assist developers /builders with complex projects and to constantly improve the sanction process by cutting down delays. e) Integration of agencies outside the ULBs for online clearances : Various agencies like AAI, NMA, SUAC, Fire Services, Department of Industries, Ministry of Defence , etc. grant NOC clearance to the buildi ng plans in certain specific cases. This may be streamlined for Ease of Doing Business by following 2 directions as given below :\u2014 i. Building permission for specific areas /sizes are to be examined by the external agencies. These areas should be plotted on GIS based colour -coded map which may be made available in the public domain on the agency 's webs ite, with clearly identified co ordinates so that building falling only in these areas need to approach the concerned agencies for obtaining clearances. These maps may also be made available on the website of the concerned municipal b odies. ii. The external agencies also need to develop online clearance/NOC application systems which should suitably be integrated with the online building approval systems of the municipal bodies. The two systems should be so compatible that the building plans submitted to the local bodies may after scrutinizing with colour -coded zoning maps shall be e -transmitted to the external agencies. The agency concerned should give clearance within a period of maximum of 10 days with no requirement of applicant to physically visit the offices of the agencies. The NOC may again be e -transmitted to the concerned local body on the building permission system so that the ULB shall use those for final approv al.

[No. 36 -8 The objective of issuing the charter is to improve the quality of public service in terms of timely delivery. Such charters shoul d be brought out by all municipalities to maintain high standards of accountability and transparency. The standards of service to be provided, the maximum number of days required for building approvals and the standards procedures should be listed out in t he citizens ' charter. Some states have gone a step further and introduced a C itizen Service Delivery Guarantee Act whereby the timelines prescribed by a citizen charter are made statutory and binding on officials. b) Capacity Building : Capacity building mea sures are to be adopted for such functionaries to identify Training Needs (TNA) and other technical requirement of duties that they are required to discharge. Fresh recruitments commensurate to the technical qualification /experience are to be made by the UT, if there is complete absence of the technical expertise needed for the said services. c) Empowered Committees : The Authorities may also consider constituting 'Empowered Committees ' or 'Peer Expert Groups ' for undertaking scrutiny and approval. This commi ttee can be manned as per the requirement and area of more than one municipality can be put under its jurisdiction. This has special significance for tall buildings. d) Simplification of Bye-laws : The B uilding Bye-laws have been simplified for easy comprehe nsion of lay person as well as professionals involved in developmental activities. The simplification process should also include the process of application, the filling up of forms and streamli ning the process of application.

Unless, the global surface temperature rise is restricted to no more than 2oC compared with pre- industrial levels, the IPCC has warned that the world will see irreversible catastrophic climate change . (b) India being a signatory to the UNFCCC, has pledged for efforts to assess the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of anthropogenic origin and removal by sinks. India 's per capita emissions are still considered low at 1.9 tonnes (2013), but its total emissions are next only to China and the US and is likely to overtake those of the EU by 2019. (c) While comparing the Indian cities for their emission scores, Delhi is on top as the biggest emitter at over 38. 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent overall emissions, followed by Greater Mumbai at 22.7 million tonnes and 134 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 Chennai at 22.1 million tonnes, Kolkata at 14.8 million tonnes, Bangalore at 19.8 million tonnes, Hyderabad at 13.7 million tonnes and Ahmedabad at 9 million tonnes were the other cities whose emissions for the year were calculated sector -wise. (d) As per the statistics of Transport Department (GNCTD), total number of vehicles in Delhi is more than the combined total vehicles in Mumbai , Chennai and Kolkata. Delhi has 85 private cars per 1000 population against the national average of 8 cars per 1000 population. In terms of Co2 emissions due to motor vehicles, Delhi emits about 12.4 million tonnes while the city of Bengaluru emits about 8.6 million tonnes . (e) Therefore, addressing the quantum of emissions from the \"Transport \" and \"Domestic \" sector emerges to be the high priority subjects under the overarching umbrella of \"Climate change mitigation \" as committed to the UNFCC. (f) Encouraging \"Electric Vehicles \" as a viable option for phased transportation in terms of short and long-distance trips with appropriate \"Charging Infrastructure \" is therefore, the pre-condition for this paradigm shift I phased migration to sustainable transportation . (g) For these changes are required in i nfrastructure provisions (at Regional and City level s) and in Development Control Regulations (in terms of provisions therein) to include the formulations of norms and standards for \"Charging Infrastructure \" in the said Master Plan Regulations and UT/State Building Regulations for adoption across the countr y suiting local conditions. 8.3 EV Charging Technology 8.3.1 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ( EVSE) : An EVSE is a wall mounted box that supplies electric energy for recharging of electric vehicle batteries. Also, EVSEs have a safety lock -out feature that does not allow current to flow from the device until the plug is physically inserted into the car. No. 36 -8] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 135 EVSEs can be customized with added features like \u2014 \u00b7 Authentication . \u00b7 Integrated payment gateways . \u00b7 Software for remote monitoring . As electric vehicle charging technology continues to advance, several standards and guidelines have become widely accepted across the industry. Chapter 8 gives a brief overview of charging infrastructure technology, standards, and terminology . 8.3.2 Different types of EVSE : (a) Charging speeds : Charging power, which determines the time required to charge a vehicle, can vary by orders of magnitude across charge points, as shown in Table 8.3. A small household outlet may charge as slowly as 1.2 K W, while the most advanced rapid charging stations can charge at up to 350 KW. Charging infrastructure is broadly broken into three categories based on speed: Level 1, Level 2, and direct current (DC) fast charging (sometimes referred to as Level 3). (Source: \"Emerging Best Practices for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure \", Oct., 2017) (b) Private Charging : Charging batteries of privately -owned cars through domestic charging points. Billing is mostly part of home domestic metering . (c) AC \"Slow \" Charging : The home private chargers are generally used with 230Vl15A single phase plug which can deliver a maximum of up to about 2.5KW of power. The EVSE supplies AC current to the vehicle's on -board charger which in turn converts the AC power to DC allowing the battery to be charged. (d) Public Charging : For charging outside the home premises, electric power needs to be billed and payment needs to be collected. The power drawn by these chargers may need to be managed from time to time. (e) DC \"Fast\" Charging : DC current is sent to the electric car's battery directly via the charge port. FC chargers (usually 50 KW or more) can supply 100 or more kilometres of range per hour of charging. The fast chargers would generally be used as a top -up, rather than fully 136 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 charging vehicles. These are important for cab companies and corporate users who have a fleet of electric cars. 8.4 Options for EV Charging : (a) There is an urgent need to offer flexible charging infrastructure for different vehicle segments to drive adoption of EVs. Charging infrastructure is the most crucial enabler in the entire EV value chain. The exploration of different charging models according to the local conditions shall enable faster deployment of electric vehicles in the country . (b) EV share in all vehicl es : It has been broadly projected that by the current rate of adoption of EVs , about 15% of all vehicles in the country would be EVs by the year-2020. Therefore, while assuming percentage composition of all proposed capacities in Public facilities of vehicle holding capacity, the Metropolitan and 'Tier I' cities will be assume d d to have a higher percentage share of EVs, say 20% for now. The charging infrastructure prescriptions in all urban development guidelines shall, therefore, be in consonance with the said percentage . (c) Power Load sanction to premises : While adding these Charging Infrastructures to the proposed set of building types of the Indian cities, enhanced Power Load shall have to be had for each such building type by the Power DISCOMs, commensurate to the total additional power requirement of simultaneous operation of all the prescribed charging points in the premise. With further advancement of charging technologies and the enhanced capacity of chargers to draw more power, it is advised that the load capacity assigned to each premise should be kept with a safety factor of 1.25 with a long -term vision of 30 years.

CHAPTER 10 RAINWATER HARVESTING This chapter gives the mandatory requirements of water conservation. The methods and techniques shall be adopted from NBC, 2016. 10.1 The Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system : The harvesting of rainwater simply involves the collection of water from surfaces on wh ich rain falls, and subsequently storing this water for use. The rainwater collected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into the underground aquifers. In scientific terms water harvesting (broadly) refers to collection and storage of rainwate r from the rooftops. This also restricts evaporation and seepage into building foundations. All buildings having a plot size of 100 sq.m. Or more, while submitting the building plans for sanction, shall mandatorily include the complete proposal of rainwate r harvesting. A rainwater harvesting system consis ts of\u2014 (a) Roof catchment ; (b) Gutters ; (c) Down pipes ; (d) Rainwater /Storm water drains ; No. 36 -8] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 165 (e) Filter Chamber ; (f) Storage Tanks /Pits/Sumps ; (g) Ground Water recharge structures like pit, trench, tube well or combination of above structure. Rainwater Harvesting is a way to capture the rain runoff, store that water above ground or charge the underground aquifers and use it later. This happens naturally in open rural areas. But in congested, over -paved metropolitan cities, ther e is a need to devise methods to capture the rainwater. The rainwater that is incident on the surface /rooftop is guided to bore wells or pits or new/old /abandoned wells through small dia meter pipes to recharge the underground water which can be used later whenever required. Rainwater can be harvested to the extent of 55,000 litres per 100 sq. m. area per Year from rooftops. 10.2 Rain water harvesting techniques: There are two main tech niques of rainwater harvestings \u2014 (a) Storage of rainwater on surface for future use. (b) Recharge to ground water. The technical aspects and options of Rainwater harvesting from which the city authorities can assess and choose to adopt (Refer Appendix for the technical aspects and options as suggested by Mo del Building Bye -Laws , 2016). 10.3 Harvesting provisions in various Building categories: All buildings in a city contribute to the rainwater runoff during the monsoon and hence such runoff can be harvested for water reuse /recharge. The indicative provisions of rainwater harvesting in various buildings types are: Table 10\u20141: Provisions for Rain water harvesting by building types Category Use Area of Plot (sq.m.)

CHAPTER 13 CLIMATE RESILIENT CONSTRUCTION -INTEGRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE WITH SANCTION Land, Air, Noise, Water, Energy, biological /socio - economic /solid /other waste management are the main facts considered in relation to Pre, during and Post. Building Construction for Sustainable Environment Management. Therefore, it is necessary for the building process to ensure compliance to various conditions laid down by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF and CC ). The building construction sector is a major contributor towards carbon footprints which affects climate change. India is committed towards mitigating the effects of climate change and moving towards internationally accepted norms for environmentally friendly building construction. Currently this objective of environmental safeguard is achieved through obtaining a specific environmental clearance (EC) for any construction project having a size of more than 20,000 sq. m . This is administered under notification of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. With rapid urbanisation and growth of Indian economy, it is anticipated that the construction activity will experience a proportionate growth. Government is also committed towards streamlining of clearances for buildings and real estate sector and empowering the urban local bodies with an objective of e ase of doing b usiness . 13.1 Environmental conditions for compliance during Building approvals : The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has now decided to integrate the environmental concerns into No. 36 -8] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 183 building plan approval process and empowering the concerned local body/development authority to approve and certify compliance of stipulated requirements. The new building construction proposals are classified in the following 3 categories :\u2014 (i) Conditions for Category 'A' Buildings: Built -up Area 5000 sq. m.-20000 sq. m. (ii) Conditions for Category 'B' Buildings: Built -up Area 20000 sq. m.-50000 sq. m. (iii) Conditions for Category 'C' Buildings: Built -up Area 50000 sq. m.-150000 sq. m. States are, therefore, advised to amend their building by -laws by incorporating the set of conditions for each category A, B and C as mentioned above either for the entire State /UT or clearly identified part thereof, where they would like to integrate the environmental clearance conditions with building permissions and empower the local auth ority to examine, stipulate and ensure compliance of conditions required to address environmental concerns the State /UT should submit such proposal/notification at draft stage as well as a copy of the final notification to the MoEF and CC. (a) For building plans with a total built-up area between 5,000 sqm . and 1, 50,000 sqm. and environment clearance will be required to be synchronized with the building regulations . (b) The concerned Urban local body, authorized to sanction building plans, shall ensure at the time of sanctioning a building plan that the environmental requirements stipulated in Table 16.1 (for above 5,000 sqm . and up to 20,000 sqm.), Table 12.2 (for above 20,000 sqm. and up to 50,000 sqm.) and Table 12.3 (for above 50,000 sqm. and up to 1,50,000 sqm.), as the case may be, are complied with. 184 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3.

These are constructed 1 to 2m, wide and to 3m. deep which are back filled with boulders, gravels, coarse sand. (b) Trenches .\u2014These are constructed when the permeable stream is available at shall ow depth. Trench may be 0.5 to 1m. wide, 1 to 1.5m deep and 10 to 20m long depending up availability of water. These are back filled with filler materials. (c) Dug wells .\u2014Existing dug wells may be utilized as recharge structure and water should pass through fi lter media before putting into dug well. (d) Hand pumps .\u2014The existing hand pumps may be used for recharging the shallow/deep aquifers, if the availability of water is limited. Water should pass through filter media before diverting it into hand pumps. (e) Recharge wells .\u2014Recharge wells of 100 to 300 mm. dia meter are generally constructed for recharging the deeper aquifers and water is passed through filter media to avoid choking of recharge wells. (f) Recharge Shafts .\u2014For recharging the shallow aquifer which are locate d below clayey surface, recharge shafts of 0.5 to 3 m. diameter and 10 to 15 m. deep are constructed and back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse sand. (g) Lateral shafts with bore -wells .\u2014For recharging the upper as well as deeper aquifers lateral shafts of 1.5 to 2 m. wide & 10 to 30 m. long depending upon availability of water with one or two bore wells are constructed. The lateral shafts are back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse san d. (h) Spreading techniques .\u2014When permeable strata start from top then this techniqu e is used.

Although, Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) occur in nature and thus have always been present on earth (Sun is the biggest source of natural EMR), nevertheless their occurrence has become more pronounced due to rapid advances of wireless technology in the commu nication sector. The twentieth century witnessed, steady rise of environmental exposure to man -made sources of EMF due to increasing electricity demand, ever -advancing wireless technologies and changes in work practices and social behaviour. The unpreceden ted growth in communication industry in recent years has also caused an exponential rise in electromagnetic radiations in the envelopes surrounding all living habitats. Human beings are thus exposed to a complex mix of electric and magnetic fields at many different frequencies, at home and at work. EMF (Electro Magnetic fiel ds) can be broadly divided into \u2014 1. Low-frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The common sources of which include power lines, household electrical appliances, and 2. High frequency electromagnetic fields .\u2014The main sources of which are radar, radio and television broadcasting, mobile telephones and their base stations, induction heaters and anti -theft devices etc . 230 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 Given below is the chart of Electromagnetic spectrum which highlights various ranges of frequencies and the equipment which work in these ranges of frequencies: \u2014 Figure G-1 Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt precautions for living beings from any effects of electromagnetic radiations at our work places as well as at our living spaces. Electromagnet ic Radiations : Effects o f Exposure : The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those on humans, depend upon the frequency as well as the penetrating power of the radiation. Initially, it was believed that low frequency fields were too weak to cause heating to a significant level and thus do not have any biological effect. There have been a number of epidemiological studies for a relationship between cell phone us e and consequent health threats that have been largely inconclusive. Thus, it can be concluded that their effect is not very prominent although significant. However, there are sufficient evidences to suggest the existence of No. 36 -8] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 231 complex biological effects of w eaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields, and modulated RF and microwave fields. World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as a possible group 2b carcinogen (possible weaker threats ). In case of low -frequency radiations (radio waves to visible light) therefore, depending upon the power of the radiation heating effects are caused due to absorption of radiation by the living cells. These thermal effects increase with the frequency of radi ation as penetration of radiation into the organism increases (for example microwaves penetrate more than infrared rays ). At higher frequencies (visible and beyond) however, the individual photons of the radiation carry enough energy individually and thus directly or indirectly can damage biological molecules. All frequencies of UV radiation have therefore been classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. In this context it is a significant fact that Ultraviolet radiation from sun exp osure is the primary cause of skin cancer. Thus, at such frequencies electromagnetic radiations cause much more damage to biological systems than simple heating. This is most obvious for the \"extreme \" Ultraviolet, X -ray and Gamma radiations, which are refe rred to as ionizing radiations due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials which include living tissues as well. Since such radiation can produce severe damage to life at powers that produce very little he ating, it is considered much more dangerous than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. Health risks from Electromagnetic radiations can be numerous depending upon the power and frequency of radiations . From the perspective of prevention of any health e ffects of Electro Magnetic Radiations there is a need of suitable precautions, since it is not possible to keep away from them owing to the advent of wireless communication technology which is based upon electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies besides many other applications like microwave, remote controlled toys, cordless phones, TV remotes, etc. 232 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 Guidelines for Buildings and Built forms mitigating effects of EMR : While planning a building or a residential complex /township, it is most desirable to list all probable equipment /appliance emitting Electromagnetic Radiations in order of ascending/descending intensities. These should also be categorized as per indoor and outdoor emissions. Their placement in the built space and surroundi ngs can then be decided based on certain premises . The most fundamental principal in this regard is that the effect of Electromagnetic Radiation decreases with increase in distance from radiation emitting source. It is thus advisable \u2014 \u00b7 To keep a safe distance from working electric and electronic equipment . \u00b7 Minimize the use of all equipment working on wireless technology like cordless phones, Wi -Fi, Bluetooth and the cell phones . \u00b7 Disconnect electric and electronic equipment from the power supply when not in use, especially in areas of prolonged occupancy . Further, the list of equipment/appliances generally used in and around working/living space is placed below for appreciation of EMR radiation: \u2014 1. RF Sources i.e. the transmitting towers suc h as AM/FM radio towers, TV towers, cell phone towers transmitting EMR continuously. 2. Cell phone which is ON but not in use also radiates and Wi Fi (Wireless Internet ). 3. Cordless phone . 4. Wi-max. 5. Other wireless devices . 6. CFL (Compact Florescent Light ) bulbs . 7. Neighbouring EMR sources that are located next to shared walls . 8. Computers and laptops . 9. Air conditioning systems . 10. Refrigerators . 11. Electrical heating systems /Microwave Ovens . 12. Power generators and voltage converters . 13. Stereo and home entertainment systems . 14. Fans . No. 36 -8] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 233 This list is only indicative and not exhaustive and there can be additions to it. From the view point of effective communication, providing of mobile towers in a township /office complex is an essential requirement and thus should be carefully planned. The mobile tower generates and transmits high frequency radiations; so more care is needed for their placement. It should be ensured that the building identified to mount the tower should be the tallest in the vicinity and should not have adjoining buildings o n which proposed or existing habitable floors are within close -range . OR Mobile Tower should be mounted on the highest sanctioned building in an area. In regular practice that many cellular operators mount their antenna on a single tower along with other o perators which increase the effects of EMR manifolds and should thus be avoided as far as possible. Else height . of the tower should be increased. Besides, Substation Equipment like Transformer, DG set etc. are also to be provided for fulfilling the bulk p ower requirement of the building and should be suitably placed for electrical safety as well as for mitigating effects of EMR. However, as these are low frequency devices, their placement is too decided more from electrical safety point of view than EMR. In addition, various light. sources inside the living/working spaces, UPS, servers, various other equipment running on Wi -Fi may also emit EMR. Hence their placement inside the building also needs careful consideration. Thus, in a built environment of consi derable human occupancy, following broad guidelines should be adopted for placement of utility equipment /appliances serving the building as a whole :\u2014 Equipment external to the building: Mobile Towers 234 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 Figure G-2 Location of communication towers is governed by radio frequency system adopted and as far as possible cellular operator should try to avoid residential areas. However, where it is not possible to avoid these, they should request for permission from the appropriate authority for installation on roof top of the tallest existing buildings \u2014 i. First preference should however, be given to the location of tower in the commercial areas or other public areas. ii. Where it is not possible to avoid the location of this tower in residential, area possibility should be explored to locate them in green belts within residential sectors or open spaces/community buildings in the sectors . Where it is not possible to find such suitable space mentioned at Sr. No. (ii) above, tower should be permitted on the roof top of residential buildings subject to the condition that a structural safety certificate from a certified Structural Engineer has been obtained. Such towers should not be permitted on occupied bui ldings, however if inevitable, a Steel /Metal frame of 6 m. height over the roof level of the last habitable floor of the building should be provided to accommodate the tower and its associated units. Structural stability of the said building should be calc ulated with the overall loading of such metal steel frames mounted atop and \"Structural stability certificate \" should be submitted by a registered structural engineer with the application for the permission of building (pre-design) or installation (post -design). Transformers .\u2014In addition to the fenced ionized area around a transformer, neighbourhood level congregation activity areas should not be planned/permitted within 3 m of the fence. Diesel Generators .\u2014The location of the Generator within the Plot prem ises should not be adjacent to any habitable /community / recreational activity within a radius of 3 m. Indoor equipment/Appliances: Electrical Switchboards .\u2014Unless otherwise amended by Barrier - free access regulations to such fixtures, they should be mounted as per existing stipulations laid down in CPWD General Specifications for Electrical Works -Part I Internal 2013. No. 36 -8] The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. 235 Wireless Routers .\u2014 Within the housing unit, the vertical mounting height of the router should be not les s than 4 feet and should be kept in the Drawing /Dining zone and not within the zones of longer period of occupancy e.g. Bedrooms. In non -residential units i.e. office spaces these routers should be kept as much away as possible and should be switched off w hen not in use. Figure G-3 Server Room .\u2014Occupied Work -stations should be at least 5 m away from the server room or associated equipment. If people are sitting in the same room, they must wear protective gear and should not have prolonged exposure. Computer .\u2014Should be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space, it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. UPS.\u2014Should also be placed in the most isolated place in a dwelling unit, while in an office space it should not be less than 2.5 feet away from the person using it. Mobile Phone .\u2014It usually remains with the user all the time. The only time it is kept away is when it is being charged. Thus mobile should be charged from a remotely located power point. It is thus preferable to provide a charging station in almost every working/living sp ace at a location, as far as permissible from living space considerations. Light sources .\u2014Usually, sun as a source of natural light is the biggest source of electromagnetic radiations. However, the atmosphere surrounding us provides a natural shield from electromagnetic radiations. In this context, the light sources used inside a living/working space should be given careful consideration 236 The J&K Official Gazette, 2nd Dec., 2021/11th Agra ., 194 3. [No. 36 -8 from the point of view of Electromagnetic Radiations. Man y luminaries available presently, like Fluorescent tubes, compa ct fluorescent lamps, LED lights etc. are used in working /living spaces. So, their use should not only be determined from the point of view of energy conservation but also from the point of view of Electromagnetic Radiations. For this purpose, recommendati ons of the manufacturers should serve as proper guidelines \u2014 Table G\u20141: below summarizes appropriate placement of equipment 's/appliances in the built environment :\u2014 Sr. No Equipment Minimum safe distance 1. Mobile Towers 6 m height over the roof level of the last habitable floor of the building. 2. Transformers 3 m 3. Electrical Switchboards No Change 4. Wireless Routers 4 feet (1.2 m) 5. Server Room 5 m 6. UPS 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 7. Diesel Generators Radius of 3 m 8. Mobile Phone 2 feet (0.6 m) 9. Computer 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 10. Laptop 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 11. UPS 2.5 feet (0.75 m) 12. Wireless Router modem 4 feet (1.2 m) 13. Server room 5 m away from workstations Note: \u2014Intensity of Electromagnetic Radiations decreases with increase in distance from the radiation source. So as to minimize exposure maximum possible distance should be kept. "}
