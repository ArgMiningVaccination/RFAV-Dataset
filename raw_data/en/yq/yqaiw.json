The Community Profile Report (CPR) is generated by the Data Strategy and Execution Workgroup in the Joint Coordination Cell, under the White House COVID-19 Team. It is managed by an interagency team with representatives from multiple agencies and offices (including the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the Indian Health Service). The CPR provides easily interpretable information on key indicators for all regions, states, core-based statistical areas (CBSAs), and counties across the United States. It is a snapshot in time that: Data in this report may differ from data on state and local websites. This may be due to differences in how data were reported (e.g., date specimen obtained, or date reported for cases) or how the metrics are calculated. Historical data may be updated over time due to delayed reporting. Data presented here use standard metrics across all geographic levels in the United States. It facilitates the understanding of COVID-19 pandemic trends across the United States by using standardized data. The footnotes describe each data source and the methods used for calculating the metrics. For additional data for any particular locality, visit the relevant health department website. Additional data and features are forthcoming. Effective April 30, 2021, the Community Profile Report will be distributed on Monday through Friday. There will be no impact to the data represented in these reports due to this change. After Monday June 12th, 2023, as a result of changes in reporting cadence after the expiration of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) declaration, this dataset will only be updated once a week on Fridays. - Dropped the Expected Deliver Date column - This was a derived field set to 3 days after the Last Order Date field. - Added the following fields Last Date Delivered Total Courses Courses Available Courses Available Date - last_order_date - last_date_delivered - total_courses - courses_available_date Added the following columns - facility_id - last_report_date - grantee_code - provider_pin - grantee_code - provider_pin - state_provider_pin Added the following columns - provider_status - provider_note - A \"_coverage\" append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week. - A \"_sum\" append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week. - A \"_avg\" append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.

The State Profile Report (SPR) is generated by the Data Strategy and Execution Workgroup in the Joint Coordination Cell, in collaboration with the White House. It is managed by an interagency team with representatives from multiple agencies and offices (including the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the Indian Health Service). The SPR provides easily interpretable information on key indicators for each state, down to the county level. - Focuses on recent outcomes in the last seven days and changes relative to the month prior - Provides additional contextual information at the county level for each state, and includes national level information - Supports rapid visual interpretation of results with color thresholds After Monday June 12th, 2023, as a result of changes in reporting cadence after the expiration of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) declaration, this dataset will only be updated once a week on Fridays. This time series dataset includes viral COVID-19 laboratory test [Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] results from over 1,000 U.S. laboratories and testing locations including commercial and reference laboratories, public health laboratories, hospital laboratories, and other testing locations. Data are reported to state and jurisdictional health departments in accordance with applicable state or local law and in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act ( [CARES Act Section 18115](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-laboratory-data-reporting-guidance.pdf)). Data are provisional and subject to change. Data presented here is representative of diagnostic specimens being tested - not individual people - and excludes serology tests where possible. Data presented might not represent the most current counts for the most recent 3 days due to the time it takes to report testing information. The data may also not include results from all potential testing sites within the jurisdiction (e.g., non-laboratory or point of care test sites) and therefore reflect the majority, but not all, of COVID-19 testing being conducted in the United States. Sources: CDC COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (CELR), Commercial Laboratories, State Public Health Labs, In-House Hospital Labs Data for each state is sourced from either data submitted directly by the state health department via COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting (CELR), or a combination of commercial labs, public health labs, and in-house hospital labs. Data is taken from CELR for states that either submit line level data or submit aggregate counts which do not include serology tests. The locations displayed above have received an order of Paxlovid or Lagevrio (molnupiravir) in the last two months and/or have reported availability of the oral antiviral medications within the last two weeks. Those sites that have not reported in the last two weeks display a notification with the site details, \"Inventory has not been reported in the last 2 weeks. Please contact the provider to make sure the product is available.\" Data about COVID-19 will continue to be updated at [CDC's COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home).
