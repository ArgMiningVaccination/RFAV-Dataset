Benefits Does ashwagandha help you sleep? What else does it help with? The Organic Sensoril\u00ae Ashwaganda in our supplement has been clinically shown to improve sleep quality. It also helps reduce everyday stress, balance mood, maintain energy levels, and improve focus. How soon will I see results? A clinical trial demonstrated a 62% reduction in everyday stress and 15% reduction in levels of the stress hormone cortisol after 60 days of supplementation, with significant results also observed after 30 days. How many Bragg ACV products can I take per day? Based on the scientific literature, we recommend taking up to 2400mg of acetic acid daily in any combination of Bragg ACV products. For example, you can take True Energy, Daily Balance and Inner Glow ACV Supplements all in one day! Or any other combination of liquid ACV, Refreshers and/or ACV shots. Since these products contain acetic acid, it is essential to take them with meals and plenty of water. If you have a sensitive stomach, start by taking each product on separate meal occasions. Before starting a new supplement regimen, please consult your doctor. Is 125mg of Ashwagandha enough to see benefits? Unlike many other Ashwagandha supplements, Bragg Daily Balance uses Sensoril\u00ae Ashwagandha: a high potency Ashwagandha extract. A clinical study with 130 subjects demonstrated that at 125mg dosing, Sensoril\u00ae Ashwagandha significantly decreased stress and reduced serum levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This high potency is due to Sensoril's patented extraction process, using both leaves and roots of the Ashwagandha plant along with aqueous extraction to achieve a unique bioactive profile. This allows Daily Balance to deliver benefits at lower dosing than other products.
