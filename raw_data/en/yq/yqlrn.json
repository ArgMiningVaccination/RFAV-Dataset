Instead, the clear aligners gently guide teeth without calling any attention to your treatment. Unless, of course, the trays get stained from exposure to coffee, an inconsistent oral hygiene routine, and the like. Luckily, that's where Invisalign cleaning crystals come in. Offering a deeper clean, they can help restore your aligners. If you're unsure how to use them, keep reading for a step-by-step guide! A Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Cleaning Crystals To properly utilize your Invisalign cleaning crystals, you should: - Remove your aligners and rinse them with lukewarm water. - Place your trays in a clean container, filling it with enough water to submerge them. - Add one packet of cleaning crystals to the water. - Gently shake/mix the solution to distribute the crystals. - Let your aligners soak for 15 minutes or so (it's best to do this while you're eating or completing your oral hygiene regimen to still meet your 22-hour-a-day wear time). - Rinse the aligners in clean water. How Often Should the Cleaning Crystals Be Used? With proper care, you shouldn't need to use the cleaning crystals each day or even each week. However, if you find that your aligners are beginning to look a bit discolored or are starting to smell, then soaking them in a packet of cleaning crystals can certainly help. In your Invisalign welcome box, there should be enough to get you through at least the first six months of your treatment. If you end up needing more, then talk to your orthodontist. They may have some additional packets on hand or can recommend an alternative. Note: do NOT use household items, like bleach, that are toxic and not meant for cleaning your aligners. 5 Additional Tips for Keeping Your Aligners Clean and Clear The best way to keep your aligners clean and clear is by caring for them properly on a daily basis. Some important best practices include: - Rinsing them each time you remove them and before you put them back in your mouth - Using a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently clean them each morning and evening - Never eating or drinking anything (with the exception of water) with them in - Brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash after each meal - Using your cleaning crystals when they begin to look stained or discolored If your aligners take on a yellow tinge, your teeth will look discolored as a result. That's why it's so important that you keep them clean! Fortunately, when used properly, the cleaning crystals can help keep your trays nice and discreet.
