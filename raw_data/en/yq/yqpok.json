The US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday signed off on updated COVID-19 boosters for [children as young as 5 years old](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines). Moderna's is authorized for children as young as 6, as long as it's been at least two months since their last shot. Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine is for kids 5 and older, at least two months after their last vaccine dose or booster shot. Both companies' new boosters for children target the dominant omicron strain causing most COVID-19 cases right now. Later on Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [endorsed the shots for children](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1012-COVID-19-Vaccines.html), the final step needed to make them available at pharmacies and clinics throughout the US.

According to an [Oct. 5 report](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-vaccination-trends/) from the American Academy of Pediatrics, 38% of children 5 to 11 have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 9% of children 6 months through 4 years have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. [Children as young as 6 months](/health/parenting/covid-vaccines-for-children-under-5-what-to-know/) can get a primary COVID-19 vaccine (the first two doses). The older COVID-19 boosters will be taken off the market now that updated formulas are authorized, but the original vaccines will remain available for children who haven't had any COVID-19 shots yet.
