We emphasize individualized, compassionate care, and offer conventional medicine as well as acupuncture, herbal medicine and other branches of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine. We also offer laser therapy, surgery, dentistry, lab work and radiology. We generally see two types of patients. The first are usually regulars of the practice who come in for wellness care. Their dogs and cats are typically seen annually or semi-annually for a checkup. This includes a thorough exam, and depending on age, health, lifestyle and risks, blood profiles, testing and any required lab work. The second type come from referrals or research done by an animal's owner. Serious, painful, or life-threatening medical issues may be involved and our new patients have often been to specialists and had numerous tests. Dr. Peggy has extensive experience dealing with these kinds of cases. Often a client needs the help of someone who can review case files, look at everything that has been done, then examine the patient using both eastern and western medicine. Dr. Peggy has enough experience in both western and complementary/alternative modalities to guide you honestly in how to proceed.
